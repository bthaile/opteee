 you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you In And you can see a bunch of these names, a bunch of them will be smaller names whenever you're looking at really big percent changes. A lot of it will come from smaller names. It's less move, let's room that it has to cover in order to hit that. It doesn't matter here for our conversation what matters is the sectors. So if you take a look across the industries for these companies that are absolutely leading and this isn't by the way a raw output, this is still filtered. I'm still looking at stuff that's worth at least a few bucks has at least some market cap to it and has options. So this is not a raw look at this metric. But if we look inside of this, you'll notice that if we take a look at the leading sectors and then we take a look at some of these broader performance, there's actually quite a few in here that buck that trend healthcare sticks out to me. Healthcare has been doing very, very poorly, but we see medical here, we see medical here, we see medical here. So there's a bunch of medical companies that are just crushing it. Now it requires a little bit of nuance analysis because biotech is very much like this where there will be certain names that just absolutely smash it based on why based on why they're seeking approval for a new drug and then what the subsequent approvals may or may not be. So it's a little bit of an anomalous circumstance. If we click out of the drugs side of things and we click into things like internet software, tech, insurance, insurance continues to crush it. So you'll find some key themes across the leaders here, but the themes that you see here don't necessarily directly align with the S&P sector leaders, which is an important deviation. We'll go a little deeper into that tomorrow on the pro stream because there's a couple very tradable ideas in there playing a modified sector rotation analysis. But we just pretend that this name's not here. We'll just scroll right past that into some of these other names. There's a ton of companies that are 100% plus over the last 52 weeks. And again, you'll notice that it's really spread across a bunch of different industries, the main ones that you're going to continue seeing pop up in here have to do with internet software, tech. Those are the big ones that fall outside of biotech as broad buckets. So pretty decent spots, I think, to look for upside ideas as far as I'm concerned. But we're still seeing small caps struggle. Small caps continue to struggle pretty significantly. So if we take a look at a comparative move here from these two phases, kind of the dip to the low close, or I guess this is an open. And then from that open to where we are now down 20 and a quarter here and then up 2377 here. If we do that same move in this one, we have to go further back and I WM because the highs back here. But if we measure that move here, it's 27%. I guess a little more because I should have used this one. And then from here to here, it's 25%. So the thing that I want you to pay attention to here and again, the tradable idea is even though I WM and small caps had a much larger decline. If you start playing this recent rally out, this is actually a pretty strong rally out. Again, 25% here, 23% here, not big discrepancy, but enough that it makes the trade interesting to me. So and I've mentioned interest in small caps a little while for actually a little while now, specifically from the lens of either trading the index or within the index. Most of the stuff that I have on right now is not at the index level, but it's looking for leadership within the index because as always, we will continue to see that kind of behavior, which is worth, which is worth tracking at least from my style of trading. Hey, yo, what up Lauren Joe Scott H. He says, biggie, why did you have to short GM easy? So hard. Yeah, it's kind of a bummer to see GameStop. Didn't love the new offering. I get why they're doing it. But it does unfortunately punish the stock in the near term. Like that's kind of all there is to it. And it's not massive. And I do think it's for the longer term benefit. And I'm comfortable saying that that said, it still does have an unfortunate impact on the near term price performance. So for those that don't know, there was another move, recent move by GameStop where there's another debt movement here. I think this is here. Wait, is this the Bitcoin buyer, the debt? I think this is all debt. Late Wednesday plans to raise more debt, a move that could indicate another Bitcoin purchases looming. The interesting thing is that they still have cash. So I don't, I don't actually know why they would be looking to raise another 1.75 billion when they have cash. And I believe in Cohen, the dude's smart. He knows more than I do. So there's obviously a tactical footprint here that I'm just not fully appreciating. But the thing that is unfortunate is that at some point, the debt needs to be reconciled. So and I talked about this with the prior debt offering, which is there's no near term dilution right now at this moment. But there is a high probability of dilution in the future, depending on the way that they choose to reconcile the debt because the terms of the debt matter. And I, yeah, this one confounds me a little bit. Like I said, I know there's an idea here. And I just don't know why I offer another 1.75 billion. The only thing that I can think of is it's a way to capitalize on the near term price performance of GameStop. And that is fairly tactical. So I, and I don't hate that idea, but I just view it as they, they already have cash, man. Like they have a lot of cash, like start using the cash. The moving more into the notes and stuff again, it gives them more choices, more optionality. So there's a net benefit there. The other thing I can think of is potentially if there's something earmarked for the cash that they haven't let on to yet. And that's why they're not wanting to use the existing cash, which could be that to me is slightly more probable scenario. It's my best guess. But yeah, kind of curious here. We'll see. I still have the coverage triangle running in here. And I actually, I think I just moved my short puts or hold on. Let me see. I don't know if I did or I didn't. I remember looking at them. What's today? No, I haven't touched them. I haven't touched. Oh, I remember I looked at them today. And I remember thinking to myself, wow, there's a lot of vol left in these even though there's only, I'm in the 20 June. So there's nine days left. And I have the 28. So those were looking just fine and now they're looking just not fine. That's what that's what this is right now. So love that for me. Especially which such short duration left. This will look just like a straight party tomorrow. So let's actually see what those will do because you're always going to have to do something here. They're going to look like the 28s. It's not actually going to look like this. They're going to look like what is close at 28s at 25. So $3 higher. So 31s. This is what it'll look like. So these will be trading for about three bucks. I sold it for $1.74. Love that for me. And let's see. I don't imagine rolling will be that difficult. We'll have to see what all this price is out to you. Right now the when you're quoting stuff like this when there is a big move after hours, all of this stuff is fucked up. So this stuff that's at the money like the 25s. This is not actually a 36 delta. And this also in no world would be trading for $57. So that's kind of the tricky part. It'll look a little more like these here. But vol is going to pop up a little bit in them. But those are only at 67% utilization. So I will probably use at least one of my silver bullets and add a little more size right now. It's in the sample portfolio that I've been updating you guys on. It's at just a six lot. So with just the six lots. It's at six lot at the 28s cash secure requirement on those is 16,800. So the utilization on the 25K allocation is 67.2%. So we still have some room to move, which we probably we being me and Thor will probably need to capitalize on some of that residual size, which is funny too because I was literally going back and forth on buying shares at some point because I would like to start building at least a little bit of a holding in here. But it's so hard to step away from the short put side of the equation not only because of stuff like this, but because of how range bound it's been right. If I look over the last, this is a six month daily, like it's effectively flat. So this is really, really solid place for selling options because we're not getting these big massive moves. Now one caveat is if we find ourselves back down in like the low 20s, there's a really good chance instead of buying shares, I'll actually buy options. I will create an abomination of a strategy where it's kind of like a coverage triangle plus a ratio called diagonal. The reason for doing that is more so because the there's so much volume of puts, you can't say no to it. And there's so much of all in the near term calls, can't say no to that. But by trading instead of shares with the long options at those kind of cycles, you just gain a little bit of leverage. And it allows me to actually make some decent money on these smaller moves, but you pay a lot. You pay up for those long calls. We're just not quite there yet. I don't think. So yeah. David says all my GME short calls will expire. Yeah, that's awesome. That's and that's exactly what you need. I don't know where the short calls are at. And I assume you probably will have either a call spread or some sort of long shares against the short calls, but that's still a really just steady, steady thing to run in something like GameStop because it's still remember like it still maintains. David says 32 calls against shares. Yeah, that's super smart. Definitely don't want to sell naked options in here. That is a terrible, terrible choice as David is full well aware of and doing a good job monitoring. I mean, the 32s were pretty safe anyways if we're being honest about it. Depending on where, what expiration you're in, but yeah, I mean, if you take a look at the volatility surface, the out of the monies, we'll just do like the front next take a look at this, right? Like the amount of upside call, vol is just crazy. For those that don't know, this is a really lucrative place to sell. The you're selling upside crash protection, which is kind of a funny thing to say, but that is what's happening here because GameStop has an insanely strong following. If the cat comes back and post something, you know GameStop is going to rally and so does the market, which is exactly why it has to price this perpetual upside skew because otherwise people like me who will happily trade around stuff, there's no way I'm taking the other side of that. There's no way I'm going to be naked short calls in GameStop unless there is a rich premium in there because there is always the potential to get your face absolutely ripped off in something that there's no real way you can plan for, right? You're just accepting the risk. That's the nature of the business on the sell side of these equations. And that's why whenever I'm selling calls in GameStop, it has to be against shares of some sort, which is also why I'm trying to pick up shares somewhere because if we take a look at the puts that I'm typically selling again, this is going to be all messed up because of how the market moved. Really, this is where the at the monies would have been. This is all screwed up right now. The near out of the money puts still have pretty good vol. And then the near out of the money calls also have good vol. So this is the kind of thing we're trading a full on coverage triangle is generally preferable. And we might get an opportunity to grab some shares tomorrow. If it does continue trading around this 25 handle, my guess is it probably would sell off a little bit more, but I'll use that as an opportunity actually to grab a little bit. So yeah, that's the idea here. We'll see how it goes. First things first will absolutely be managing those short puts that I have though, because I don't want to get assigned at 28. That's not high on my to do list right now. All right. Let's talk. Well, first before we go into the skill development session, is there anything that you guys want to take a look at today? I have a bunch of trades that I recently made and some more research that I'm running on like the zero DTE stuff. We'll go into all that stuff tomorrow. But from a high level, that's kind of at least what's happening in the in the latest with GameStop. But I want to see if there's anything you guys want to take a look at before we pivot over into the skill dev segment for this week. Lauren says I'm still stuck on why the cat unfollowed RC. Yeah, I don't get that one either. Really don't know why. And as per usual, though, it's it's designed to mean something. Sometimes I think that this something literally can just be kind of a little bit of confusion, because that is more or less what it seems like. It's just kind of some confusion because it doesn't doesn't make a lot of sense. But I imagine it's it's meant to meant to mean something. I just couldn't tell you what. Cool. All right, let's get into skill dev. So skill dev for this week is about we want to I want to talk about the concepts of scaling a small account. Now we already talked about trading a small account, surviving trading a small account. We did two episodes on that actually the last two Fridays. And over those last two Fridays, we started by analyzing what some of the common struggle points are in detail. And then the episode we did on Friday, we actually built a portfolio together. And we didn't get a chance to go through a bunch of iterations, but you pretty much got to see the the actual process of finding trades, building the portfolio, putting the trades on and then figuring out how to manage those trades as things move. And that's really the broad iterative process of scaling a 5K account. However, I made a post on Reddit not that long ago that talked about a really important concept that I do think is commonly cited and it shouldn't be. So what I'm referring to here is I will very, very commonly see some sort of post that talks about how trading options with a larger account is easy or just some flavor of that. And that just tends to come from a place of ignorance. It's not meant to be nefarious or anything. It's just misguided. And I wanted to spend a little time today talking more specifically the things that change and the things that don't change when you are scaling a trading account. Because again, you guys already know effectively what goes into scaling an options account. And we spent again the last two beginner Fridays focusing on this exact topic. So for a cliff notes version of what this looks like, I will, as always, break out the handy dandy notebook. And didn't that guy get charged with like drugs or some shit like that? Maybe I won't break out the handy dandy notebook. We'll have to call it something else. What the hell did that guy get charged with? That's the guy from lose clues. He got he got him up for something. I don't remember what he got. But he did get him up. I don't know. What do you guys will have to tell me? But anyways, we'll have to call it something other than the handy dandy notebook. When we discussed this the last couple days, at least of the episode, not the last consecutive days, there were a few key themes that went into this. The first thing was goal setting. Well, I guess expectations. Then goal setting. Here's an example of this one literally from today. I was sent a post on this. And this is from this person, a handful of days ago, it says, greed taught me a very valuable lesson today. I've been investing in stocks for almost 20 years. This is a great example of why 10 year doesn't inherently mean anything. Some people will see a big number like that and be like, oh, shit, this person's got to have it figured out. And I'm going to show you in a big way why they don't. And it says they decided to learn about options started with 25k three months ago, consistently made $500 a day that I trade on and then quit out. It's 2% return on investment on my initial 25k every day. A trade, which isn't every day. That's not much, but it's adding up. I made a mistake today, blew my account by trying to go for more lesson learned. Stop when you met your goal, even if it's $500, take the wind, shut it down. This is all wrong. It's literally all wrong. Everything about this is wrong. Greed gets you nowhere. I'm basically back to my initial 25k, but still motivated. It won't be taking any more risks like that. I'm fine with 500 each day. I trade this has everything to do with somebody that literally has not done this. They've not done this. They've not set their expectations in. They've not done any goal setting. And for anybody that struggles with setting expectations now, the only person you have to blame for not being able to do that successfully is yourself. There's no excuse anymore. Because it used to be difficult to find information to collate different research, to identify what's going on, why it used to be difficult. But now I literally go into Gemini, and I say research, options trading with a small account. That's it. That's all I put in there. That's literally it. I didn't say profitability, habits, nothing. I gave it that simple of a question. And it spent like eight minutes going through and finding all these different studies, many of which you're familiar with because we've looked at a lot of these together. But it literally spent time just collating all of this different research and then giving an output. The thing I want to specifically drive home here is that there is no reason to have this broken of an expectation other than complete oversight, especially for somebody that's been investing for almost 20 years. If it's a brand new person, they get some grace because brand new people don't know fucking anything as all of us don't know when we're brand new with something. And I remember full well being brand new. And you again, you get some grace if you're brand new with something, you don't know what you don't know. But somebody like this that says that they've been trading for 20 years, this is psychotic because as you can take a look here, my response, they were literally doomed from the jump. This is not an effect of them being greed. And it's funny because I can tell you they didn't learn what they needed to learn here. That's the hilarity is they're looking at greed and saying, Oh, wow, I learned a lot about greed today. And it's like dog, that's the entire wrong fucking lesson. Like you've missed the entire thing. If this is what you think you learned, you missed it. You missed the boat big time. And this is what they needed to do. And this is the first two steps here, setting expectations. And then setting smart goals based on those expectations. Because for those that don't know, $500, he's not a lot of money. $25K is also not a lot of money. This can confuse you and deceive you. You can see $500 and think it's not a lot of money. I should be able to do that. It represents a 2% relic as they correctly identified. Here's the fuck problem. Even if they did this once per week, not daily, not a couple times a week, once per week, this is a 180% gain on the year. You have to ask yourself a very, very simple question. Do I think 180% is a reasonable return? Well, if we did that first step and we went through and we set expectations by taking a look at different research, seeing what's out there, seeing how successful traders are or are not. You absolutely know the answer to this question. You know the exact answer to this question. And if we pop over to the website and look at the tool that I literally built, so reference guide do traders make money. And it's just a series of studies that you can peruse through. You'll notice something very specific. Most people do not make money long term. That's the baseline. And that's not something, not a new revelation. We know this. So then if we go back and we say, is this 100% return reasonable? It is a resounding and utter fucking no. In no world is this reasonable. And the funny part about this is they learn their very valuable lesson. I'm fine with 500 each day. I trade. They're just fine with $500 a day. If you have this 2% return daily, your annualized return, let's just $500 per day, I gave them the benefit of that. I said once a week, if you do this every day, here's your return. 14,597.5%. That's your return. So that's what they're saying. What they're saying right now is they're fine with 14,597.5% return. They're fine. That's fine. You see how fucking crazy that is? It's insane. But this goes back into the process of scaling a small account. Is if you do not go through this process of set healthy expectations and goals, this is what you do. This is what people do. This is what somebody who supposedly has been investing for 20 years. So clearly has some level of knowledge. This is what somebody that does that thinks is fine. So the point I'm making here, it's not to rag on this person because this person simply represents a thought that is so unbelievably common. They're just a vector for a conversation about a super common thought. But this goes back into having a healthy conversation about how do we begin this process of scaling of $5,000 account, $25,000, all that's small. Anything below PDT, I would consider to be like very, it's a really small account. And then small from there, it doesn't matter. It's just arbitrary lines in the sand. Once these two are done, this is hands down the most important part of this entire thing, bar none. Process. Process. I cannot overemphasize how important this is with respect to your capacity to scale a small account. How effectively can you build a process? And the process should include simple things. The process should include planning. The process should include testing. It should include in observation. It should include in analysis. And it should include an optimization. This is effectively what needs to happen for you to succeed long term as a trader, which is the concept of scaling a small account. Now this is all with the giant caveat of, and we did a very specific example before to show you how strong how powerful saving is. Saving is the most important thing to do with a small account. It's the best return you're going to get. That's why when you have a small account, your return doesn't matter. Literally doesn't matter. What matters is building a process that then can be scaled. So I want to talk about that exact thing. I want to talk about this subset here. How do we scale our process? Because at the end of the day, that is the ultimate determining factor on if this is going to work for you or not. I want to mention a couple things quickly. This is not shit that like I just knew. And I've just been doing this my whole trading career. That's not the case at all. I was an absolute train wreck my first few years. And we can classify train wreck differently. My version of train wreck is probably different than the people that are like blowing multiple accounts. I've never done anything like that. But comparatively, an absolute train wreck. And the funny thing about it is when I look back at the beginning part of my trading, I made the very same mistakes that everybody makes. I thought that this small account was going to become my future wealth. And I was trying to make that so. And it's ridiculous. It's silly. So let's take a look. I don't know what what do you guys think about X, whatever this thing is? Is this like our first actual bot? That's crazy. We got to let the bot go for a second. I'm actually really, really curious. Let's just get rid of that one though. Let's see. So let's talk about this process. And it'll actually be easier than you think. At least the concepts of the process. The application is always where it's more challenging. So the very first thing we need to do is get organized. This doesn't change. Whether you have a $50,000 account, $25,000 account, $500,000 account, $5 million accounts, all the same shit. You have to get organized. The process of organization is boring, not sexy, but it's got to get done. And this is simple stuff. This is building a trading plan, trading log. The reason why you will hear me mention these into perpetuity until I fucking die is because these are the things that literally turned my trading around. My first two years of trading were slightly negative. It was both were in single digits, but it was essentially first two years negative. However, if you think about what I was probably doing for those first few years, it's what everybody does. It's randomly bouncing around between things, completely haphazard, not tracking anything. So then when it comes back to me trying to make a logical decision, I can't make it because I don't know. So a great question to ask yourself right now on the chat is based on one of your trading approaches. Think of whatever strategy, profit mechanism you like to try to capture. Think of one of them. And I want you to answer this question. Whether it's a buys strategy, sell strategy, it doesn't matter. Literally, it doesn't matter. For your strategy, is it better to exit the trade sooner or later? That's it. ambiguous. Not defining a date, not defining P&L. Is it better to exit your trade sooner or later? And if you know your strategy well, you likely will arrive at something like PENSE, it will depend. Now, we can absolutely think about what that might mean and why. So for example, if I'm talking about my breakout approach, is it better for me to exit sooner or later? Generally sooner depends, but generally sooner, I can confidently say that. If I'm playing some sort of coverage triangle, is it better for me to exit sooner or later, typically later, let that run longer. What I'm just rattling off the top of my brain is stuff that I've spent time analyzing when I'm building the trading plan, because within the trading plan are things that I refer to as strategy outlines. And you guys have seen this in the trading, I forgot the name of the video, but if you search my channel for trading plans, it'll come up. And in strategy outlines, there's a couple key stages. There's the exact summary. There's a setup, management, AR, that's it. Some slight different versions, terminology around it, but same thing. When I'm deciding on building a strategy, I have to be able to come up with the details for all of this. And if I'm a brand new trader and I'm this person, and I don't know, right, let's give them the benefit of the doubt. Let's just say maybe the 20 years was super passive and they just don't know. That's okay. Well, the issue is if we had spent any time whatsoever planning this strategy, we would understand the potential repercussions of sizing things. But this person had no idea and they ran into a series of issues, some of which I imagine still is actually completely unseen to them, which is unfortunate. These are the instances where I hope people like this happen to come across the videos where I'm talking about their stuff. I wish there was a way to connect with them easily with this stuff to see if it can make an impact. But my guess is there's going to be a pretty significant amount of stuff detail that they're just completely not even privy to. They have no idea to even exist based on what I see here. So this is the first, this is the first major muscle movement you get to do as a trader. And guess what? This scales no matter what you do. If you have a small account, big account, huge account, tiny account, same exact shit. And we all know when we're looking at strategies, the thing that has to come in before strategies is profit mechanisms. Because that's what a strategy is based on. A strategy is based on a specific market effect that you can monetize a profit mechanism. So the first few steps in your process are completely indifferent to how much money you have. It doesn't matter. You have to go through this. If you have a strategy that you run generally and you find yourself in the scenario where you're like, I am not really confident in making an adjustment to it. Or I'm not really confident in making a choice between these couple things. That stems from a lack of research. And the way that you track this stuff over time is in a trading plan and a trading log. The last thing I'll mention here is let's say somebody pick a strategy, any strategy. We'll do a live example together of whatever this unknown strategy is about to be known to me. It's kind of like pick a card, any card. In this case, pick a strategy, any strategy. And I want to use it for an actual example together. Wheel. That's great. Wheel. Okay. So if we're going to trade the wheel and we know that there's a couple key decisions that have to be made. If we think of the executive summary for the wheel, the purpose of the wheel is to capitalize on price, direction, going up primarily. That's going to be your direct profit mechanism. Then there are secondary profit mechanisms found through the short option side of the trades and then as well as any dividends or anything like that. Cool. So we have our executive summary. Now the hard stuff, the setup. This is where we have to start actually doing the research. We have to start figuring out what tickers I should trade. Now if again, in while I'm doing this with the wheel, what I want you to do is you're listening is insert whatever strategy it is, right? Just insert your strategy name instead of the wheel. And I want you to think about these things. The first thing I need to figure out in the setup is what kind of tickers should I trade? That's the first thing you have to do. If you can't answer that for your strategy, it means that you have some work to do. The next question is what kind of time frames am I going to trade with this? What's optimal for this strategy? If you can't answer that, you have some work to do and so on and so forth. It's a process of outlining this thing that we're going to try to implement. Now let's say that you're not sure and that's okay. You might not know. But it means then we now have an RFI, a request for information. It's military term, but it's when we need data. And let's say for the wheel specifically, I'm stuck right now for optimal sale window or short puts slash short calls. Okay. So the first thing I need to do is contextualize this question because I already know that this is secondary, right? Because if you remember the executive summary, the first thing we said is the primary profit mechanism is the underlying going up. Yet a lot of traders will spend more time on this question than the one that actually matters, which is what tickers and how do I find those tickers that are going up? But provided in this scenario that we've done that and we have a sense, now we're looking at what's the sale window for these short puts and short calls. Well, we can test it. We can back test if we have access to a platformer if we know how to back test using our own data. All of that stuff can be done or we can live test it in a trade log via paper trading. The reason why we paper trade is because it's a way to get live data. So then what we can do is we can say, all right, I'm going to test selling these options at 90, 60, 40, 30, 20, 10. I'm going to test all of these. Here's the cool part. It doesn't take that much work. All you do is set up the trade log for the strategy. And then when you go in to sell your option in this context of paper trading, it's for data collection, not to implement the portfolio. So we're treating this a little bit differently. All I do is sell the same size, same delta option in all of these. And then I just watch and I see how things work and I do this consistently for some time. Even if you decide that it's something that you want to get started before you have the full answer, which is typically the right answer, you're never going to have everything completely fleshed out before you start trading a strategy. It's impossible. There's going to be a bit of a leap of faith. The cool part is with something like the wheel, you kind of know the base of what's going on. The reality is you might and you should want to optimize this is best you can, but this is still secondary. So I personally wouldn't wait until I know the distinct answer to this before I start trading it. I can come up with some assumptions. So if we understand options deeply, one of the assumptions we know is the rate of data decay. We also know which ones have most extrinsic value. So this is where we can make an educated assumption on what we think might be ideal. And then that can be what our first base position that we're actually trading is built on. So maybe this 30 days, but then we're testing these other variants so that we can literally make a decision that's informed. One of the one of the things people don't do is this. So then there's stuck second guessing their strategy. And this is one of the primary reasons why you'll find traders strategy hop or start deviating doing stupid shit is because they haven't done the research. So they're not confident in anything because it's all being figured out on the fly, which simply does not work in this space. Going all the way back to the point of this session together, this can all be done when you have zero dollars. This is completely indifferent to account size. Doesn't matter. This is going to be the same. Now, as we finish our organization requirement and we have some of this stuff built out, we have some good ideas that are generally vetted. We think there's something there and we're going to start implementing those. Then we need to start figuring out how we're actually going to manage a portfolio. This will include big differences as your account grows. Really big differences. And I want to talk about some of those because we talked about really the base of trading and building a process that doesn't really change. However, this is where things absolutely do change. So let's take a look at this portfolio management. One of the things we know is that at some point, I think it's like 150, you get portfolio margin. This breaks you off of rag T. We also know I think it's at 25k. PDT goes away. Which by the way, PDT is not your enemy. People think that like PDT is meant to keep you down. And I still would rather it not be there. I would rather traders be able to do what they want and not have their hand held. But the reason why PDT is there is because of the statistics. Because most people are going to fail in like the money on fire. This just slows it down a little bit. Now, these structural changes do change things though. So for example, with PDT gone, I can now trade zero DTEs. With PDT, I couldn't. Actually, that's a boldface law. You still can. Because you don't have to close technically. If you trade, depending on how you build a zero DTE strategy, you can have it where it's just taken into expiration. So there's actually not an intraday round trip. So even that's a boldface lie. I guess PDT just means you don't get to be stupid and try to scalp options, which is psychotic. So, but that is a structural change. Getting rid of PDT gaining access to PM is another structural change for sure. This increases efficiency. Here's what happens. When you have a small account, your portfolio is pretty much always going to be oversized. Meaning overexposed. One of the big differences is as you have a larger account, typically, the amount of money you're using goes down. You don't have to use this much. Because you gain some levels of efficiency here, that helps you. And it's one of the reasons why in my portfolio, for example, when I'm reviewing my utilization, why my utilization tends to be levered, technically, where I'm over 100% utilized. It's just to gain efficiency. And what I mean by this for those that don't know, it's I'm not like borrowing money, not trading on margin. I'm trading with margin. But if I have a cash secured put, the broker with portfolio margin is just going to ask for a margin requirement, which will be whatever number of dollars. However, I know this has to be cash secured. So what I'll do is I'll take the money that's supposed to cash secure it. And I'll put it into something like a box spread when I was trading more aggressively, it would be other trades that would reconcile before this is due, that kind of stuff. But the broker is only asking for the margin requirement. So what this is allowing me to do is trade a cash secured put, but double dip, because I will get the premium from the cash secured put. And then I'm going to get a yield from the box spread, right? It's just more efficient. If you have a small account, you're pretty much not going to be able to do this. It'd be way more difficult. Because by the time you try to put on a couple other positions, you're now already way oversized. You're kind of in in an unfortunate position. So this is one super, super simple example. And when we think about the things that change primarily, there are some of these structural changes. But then there's also the way that you implement your portfolio. And the choices you have available in the implementation of your portfolio, that's the next largest spot that you're really going to see like, quote, unquote, bigger changes. Most of what you do as a trader will not change that much. It shouldn't change that much because the primary components that go into building in edge literally can be done with no money. You do not need any money in an account to start exploring profit mechanisms to begin measuring them to understand deeply how options work so that you can use that information to make educated assumptions on what structures might make the most sense for an idea. Those kinds of things all happen completely regardless of your account size. So I'm going to take a pause there. And I want to see if you guys have any questions on any of that stuff. This was a little bit more of like, like telling you guys stuff versus as interactive as I typically prefer these to be. But I think this kind of thing is just so important for traders to get their arms around because what most people are doing when you have a smaller account is you're literally building the skill so that when you have a larger account, you are able to effectively implement that account. Because again, going back to what we talked about in the very beginning, there's not like a magic switch where trading all of a sudden becomes easy with a big account. Not the case at all. You still have to do all of this stuff in order to create success for yourself. And it generally looks a lot different than what people expect. But the cool part is it's super doable. It's super, super doable. That's the thing I always go back to with the concept of trading options is that I am I'm like shamefully far away from the smart people. But it doesn't require like some insane amount of genius to figure out how to trade and to implement trading. It requires having like robust process. And if you build a robust process, it doesn't really matter how fucking smart you are. You're simply going to see something isn't working. And then you are going to have to try something else to figure out how to make it work. Now there's always some nuance and stuff right with like determining how to test strategies and all that kind of stuff. So there's definitely nuance for sure. But most of this stuff can be done completely regardless of what what size account you have, which is the cool part I think. So that's what I got for you guys today. I am actually going to hang out for a little bit longer. I'll just kind of keep the stream going. I am going to walk through and just run through some scans. This is typically what I do at the end of the day just to see what's out there. So feel free if you want. Godwin says you do not need to use the box spread just by S. Gover Bill and they still allow you to trade with the money. Yeah, the problem with those is twofold. The first thing is the yield you get is dragged. The second thing is the way that the return on that is taxed is disadvantageous. So you're exactly correct in the comment of you don't need to do box spreads. You certainly don't. I mean, even some brokers will just immediately put your capital into a decent cash and sweep. So you might not even have to do that itself, but you're going to get a lower yield. So that's why I pretty much will always continue to run the box spread. Let's take a look at S. Gover. I mean, here's the other issue is the holding duration matters actually kind of a lot depending on where you get in on these gaps. Right. So the difference between here is 150. Here it's 151. Then it's 155. Right. So this is not a linear relationship. There are gaps that happen throughout something like S. Gover. So there is a little bit of a timing element, not a big deal, but you do have to be aware of that because you can get out at a sub optimal day. So just another thing to generally be aware of. All right. Let me take a look and see what's up. So all I'm going to do now and I'm not going to go into like building trades and stuff here that's more so what I'll do on like the pro stream. But this is a big part of what I do typically is literally just looking at scans and seeing what sticks out to me. So right now I'm looking, I'm populating a couple like different unusual options scans that I like to follow. But as always, if you guys have any questions or anything now is a perfect time, happy to chat. Tommy says box spread. How long do you typically hold a position at one time? It depends on what I have out. So it there isn't like it'll be based around the options expiration cycle. So for example, right now as you guys know, I'm trading the coverage triangle now in TQ spy. I bet those are like the main positions also games top. So what I'll do is I'll see what is the expiration cycle that I'm in for the various coverage strangles. And then I will offset the box spread from those. So let's say for example, in TQs. I think I just let me double check. I think I just moved out to July. Yeah. So I'm out in July. Now I'm in 18 July. So what I'll do is I'll make sure that the box spread doesn't extend past this often. I'll try to keep the box spread in a little closer in time so that it completely expires before us just so that I can completely de-conflict them. But it'll also depend on liquidity because if we take a look at SPX, which a really important component to trading a box spread successfully is using a European style option so that there's no early assignment risk. There's no exercise risk any of that kind of stuff. And if I'm looking at this and I see that the liquidity potentially between let's say where I might want to be. So 18 July, 36 days out. So maybe I try to find myself into any of these 11, 14, 15, any of these. And let's say that I go into the 15s and I'm trying to build the box spread. If I'm trying to build the box spread in here and it's like really a liquid comparatively to what I might get in the primary, then that'll change what I'll do. So literally we'll build one right now. And let's see what's up. So let's do maybe 5,500, 6,500. Let's see what that gets us. So that's 995.9, which is pretty close. Let me throw this into our handy, dandy box spread calculator. So this is 11 June expiration. Here's 15 July. We'll look at a 1 lot, 5,500, 6,500. Net premium here is 996.15. I know it was 995 before. The reality is you're not going to get filled at any of the other one you might actually because it's actually kind of close. NVM, this one you might get filled here, potentially. And this one is 996.15 by 1005.1. Okay. So now let's go to the primary expiration. Let's see how that same thing looks here. So we'll close this out. We have to add some more strikes. Let's get to the 55s. And the 65. Where you at 60. Okay. So this one is running 994. .9 and 1002.75. Let's calculate the bit as spread on these 7.85 points and 8.95 points. So that's the drawback here is when trying to trade the box spread on stuff like this, you can absolutely run into some liquidity issues, especially depending on if you're doing a wide box spread. So you're trading less. This most recent box spread that I ran, I actually needed to tighten it and sell and buy more because it was super, super liquid. But I did put myself in a non-standard expiration to de-conflict because I had a bunch of stuff from the coverage triangles in that expiration cycle. So yeah, the short answer to that, Tommy, is it really is based on where the coverage triangle cache is going to be needed if assignment is likely. And there's also the ability to like, it's not a giant deal. If I have a box spread that's out and I get assigned on shares that I otherwise have the cache for, but it's not available, that's when you would just be on margin. You would be borrowing from the broker because they would be supplying the cache to be into the position. But you just do the math and see how much the carrying cost is on a daily basis and see if you care about it or not. It's really easy to de-conflict because the other thing you can always do is just close the box spread. I really try to avoid that at all costs. Sometimes you have to be really, really thrifty and lag into or out of it. But lagging a box spread is super challenging and you have to accept the risk that goes with that because there is a decent risk. But typically able to get a better fill by lagging into them, it's just you run a not insignificant risk of something moving quite a lot while you're trying to get in on the spread. So just have to be aware of that. Tommy says, I bit coverage triangle. What's the current utilization and share short puts? Yeah, let's see. So I bit is currently 51.7% utilized in total. 7.5% of that is stock. 44.3% of that is cash secure puts. So mostly, mostly inputs, which will also likely continue to be the case, my expectation. Unless we get a pretty significant pullback. But right now the return on invested capital that I'm getting on the puts is too good. So I'm getting like 2.1% return on invested capital for a 20 day trade, 1.1% for a two day trade, 1.7% for a 12 day trade, 2.1% for a 12 day trade. All of this has to do with the the wall that's in I bit, which makes it also a really solid candidate for the box spread side of things. So that's where we're at there. Cool. All right, gang. I'm a hop off. Get to work. As always, if you guys need anything, hit me up in the discord for those that don't know, there is a new Patreon tier that just launched that has a monthly workshop.
