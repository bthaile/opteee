0.00s: What's up out live today?
1.68s: We're going to talk about how to actually build confidence as an
5.48s: obstinate or now you've been told actually pretty smart stuff things like
11.72s: believe in yourself.
13.72s: Trade your plan.
15.16s: Don't be greedy.
16.52s: Be patient.
17.76s: Yet, as you've heard these different things, you've gone and made the
22.00s: same smooth brain decision time and time again.
26.44s: Why does this happen?
29.52s: It is everything to do with confidence.
33.36s: Believe it or not.
34.80s: Now, there's a very dangerous piece of confidence called the
40.20s: Dunning Kruger effect.
43.20s: This is where when we first start learning something, we grow really, really
48.48s: fast.
49.12s: We learn a lot very quickly because you're starting from nothing.
52.28s: And then you think you know something at which point you typically make a big
56.20s: mistake.
57.20s: Then you realize that you don't know anything.
59.08s: And then over time, if you keep doing the thing, then you'll eventually figure it
64.64s: out.
65.64s: Now, one of the issues with building confidence as a trader is that this drop
71.76s: here is most often associated with a loss of capital.
75.32s: And most people that start trading don't have buckets of new capital to
79.76s: tap into.
80.76s: This, as it occurs, typically undoes years of effort.
86.00s: So the goal is to dampen this.
89.48s: It'll still happen, but the goal is to dampen it and learn how to actually build
94.84s: confidence in a way that's logical and makes sense.
98.64s: So this will be a little bit of a TED talk.
101.48s: But my goal is that the end of this video, you should have a pretty
105.36s: clear game plan on what you need to do.
109.68s: But then it's always down to actually doing it.
114.60s: So let's start.
115.88s: The first thing we need to do is master fundamentals of markets.
120.28s: If we think about this concept of confidence, one of the most common misconceptions is
125.76s: that you can just believe in yourself or that you can fake it until it actually starts
130.92s: to feel real.
132.48s: It is complete bullshit.
134.00s: There is one and only one way to build confidence in anything, including trading.
140.04s: And it's through the demonstration of a skill set and seeing the outcome being what
148.08s: you want it to be.
149.60s: So if I'm a basketball player and I've never touched a basketball and I have to hit 10
155.56s: free throws in order to save my life.
158.60s: How confident am I going to be going into that?
161.80s: Not very yet if I'm Kobe Bryant, recipes who shot thousands and thousands of free
169.88s: throws, how confident would he be?
172.48s: Probably supremely, even though the stakes are pretty high.
177.16s: That's the difference between actual confidence and fake confidence, which isn't confidence.
184.16s: It's nothing.
185.92s: Confidence comes from the demonstration of your skill set so that you can see the outcome.
193.60s: That in trading can be really difficult to get to because most people don't build the infrastructure
199.72s: to get to that point, which I will show you how.
203.16s: When we talk about the fundamentals, this is literally the very basics.
206.48s: This is going to invest a pediatop.
209.48s: And it's saying, what is the stock market?
212.00s: How does this thing work?
213.68s: And then it's going through this kind of very, very, very rudimentary high level research.
220.56s: Then if you're interested in derivatives and options, it's grabbing a book like this.
227.32s: Options is a strategic investment.
229.12s: It's a thick textbook.
230.84s: It's not a joke.
231.84s: It's 800,000 pages.
234.56s: But there's nothing in there that's that difficult, but it's working through the material.
238.96s: What I can tell you is that if you do just this, you start by going through invest a
245.42s: pediatop and you work through in stock market basics thing.
249.52s: You grab that book.
251.28s: Options is a strategic investment.
252.76s: You work through that book.
254.44s: By the end of that, you will absolutely be in should be more confident than without doing
260.84s: that.
261.84s: But this is the problem.
264.36s: Most people see a 500,000 page book about something that's not inately intuitive.
271.80s: And then they don't want to do it.
272.80s: They want to see if there's an easier way.
275.56s: Again, if you do not master the fundamentals, you will have no confidence.
280.80s: Why should you?
281.92s: It doesn't make any sense.
283.68s: The next thing is actually understanding market effects.
289.48s: Most options traders begin options trading by learning different structures.
293.12s: What calls and puts are what volatility is in so on and so forth.
297.16s: The problem is, if you just start trading those different option structures trying to make
303.24s: money, you're really no better off than not knowing how to trade a stock and then using
308.36s: something you don't know.
310.08s: There's not anything magical in options.
312.00s: You don't learn the basics of options, then all of a sudden have an edge.
316.24s: So that leads to a really broken feedback loop for people where you're using the thing
321.76s: that you learned, you're trading these vertical spreads, you're trading iron condors,
326.32s: but then you're not making any money.
328.16s: Well, of course not because you're just using a structure in an asset.
334.40s: There is no profit mechanism there.
336.64s: So how do we learn about profit mechanisms?
338.60s: One is you probably could guess there's tons of videos on that on my channel that you
342.56s: can look up.
343.92s: But the other thing you could do is do some cursory research.
346.84s: Get AI to help you out.
348.76s: One of the things you might find is an effect wrapped around ETF rebalancing effects or ETF inclusion
356.48s: effects or earnings effects or things that are actually deeply rooted in something we can
363.40s: explain.
364.60s: That's robust.
366.16s: The problem with these kinds of edges is that they're not what people want.
371.04s: They're not these make a million dollars overnight kind of edges.
374.80s: They're more grindy.
376.52s: You get a few points over a market return and people don't like that.
381.88s: Welcome to trading.
383.00s: This is the real life.
384.80s: The cool part is, once you accept that fact, it's still like really good money on stuff
390.32s: like that.
391.32s: But there's a step that has to be taken away from the dream phase of things.
398.60s: Next you have to learn how to test things if you don't know.
402.84s: The reason why this is important is because unlike basketball, the stuff that you test
408.32s: in trading is easy to mess up.
412.52s: And it's because there's a thing called path.
415.64s: Path is how things happen to unfold.
420.92s: Does the stock market happen to go up three days in a row?
425.24s: Does it happen to go down 10% over the next two months?
429.80s: Well, depending on what strategy you're trading, you could be trading in completely viable
433.64s: strategy.
434.84s: But if that two month path doesn't fit your strategy, then you're likely to abandon
440.16s: the strategy because you're saying, well, this isn't working.
443.48s: Then you're going to something else.
445.68s: That doesn't work.
447.64s: To have to learn how to test things, a really great way to learn how to test things
453.80s: is to go to MIT OpenCourseWare.
456.72s: This is all completely free.
458.84s: And you can take a basic class on probability and statistics.
464.48s: You can take basic classes on things like hypothesis testing to actually understand
472.44s: how to test an idea.
473.96s: And again, if you hear this, you're like, damn, that sounds like a lot of work.
477.60s: No shit Sherlock.
481.08s: Just as Santa Claus ain't real spoiler alert, there's not this source of fast, easy
487.80s: money that you're going to be able to tap into for a long-term timeframe as a trader.
493.16s: It's not there.
494.16s: Embrace the suck.
495.40s: Do the work.
496.40s: The cool part is usual.
498.28s: If you do the work, then this shit becomes pretty easy.
502.08s: Genuinely.
503.08s: Is after you do the work.
505.08s: Then you need to test the damn ideas.
508.28s: So once you learn how to do that, then you've got to do it.
511.72s: You want to outline what you're doing in a trading plan.
515.28s: I have videos on that so that you can track your ideas.
518.64s: You'll learn that that's part of a testing process is to control variables so that you
525.92s: can observe and outcome.
527.80s: Then you can mess with different variables and see what the change in the outcome is.
533.72s: That then informs what things matter and what things don't matter.
538.24s: And then how you build something that's actually robust.
542.80s: Finally, you track what you're doing.
546.60s: You might start by back testing.
548.76s: Then you might start by forward testing.
551.24s: Then you might start by paper trading.
554.20s: And after that, you might move into a small amount of test capital.
558.16s: But there has to be some method for you to actually validate what you're doing and whether
565.84s: or not it works going back to exhibit a how do you build confidence.
570.36s: It's through the observation, the demonstration of a skill set.
575.12s: This is how you demonstrate the skill set and then validate what's actually happening.
581.64s: The reason why people bounce between plans so much or strategies so much is because they're
585.80s: not confident in it.
586.80s: Why should they be?
587.80s: They've done next to no research and then they go through a weird path in markets that
592.36s: doesn't associate well with it.
594.44s: So then they abandon it.
595.56s: Then they hop onto the something else and then that vicious cycle continues.
599.96s: If you start this entire process by resting on profit mechanism, something that is fairly
605.88s: robust that we know exists, that then makes the rest of this stuff that much easier.
611.60s: Then you can branch off, go do the fun stuff, go try to find neat things that aren't
615.80s: necessarily as well researched.
618.08s: That might come and go the difference.
620.36s: For example, between market inefficiencies in risk premium.
625.00s: But there are things out there outside of this boring stuff.
629.12s: But this is the foundation.
630.48s: Be an outlier.
631.48s: See you later.
