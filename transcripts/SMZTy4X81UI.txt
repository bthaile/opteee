0.00s:  What's up outliers? Today we are going to talk about rolling short puts in levered ETFs.
9.24s:  Right now I'm trading the covered strangle on a few different tickers, two of which are
15.44s:  levered. One of them is SSO. This is a two times S and P 500 index ETF. And then there's
24.56s:  T triple Q. This is a three times leveraged NASDAQ QQ ETF. Now the reason why I trade these,
33.60s:  I have an entire video that talks about trading the covered strangle on leveraged products.
39.84s:  Significant reason is because of the volatility premium that gets priced into them.
46.08s:  And a big element of the covered strangle is the short legs that are part of it, which I'll show
55.20s:  you really quick here before we get into the rolls themselves. If we take a look at, let's say the
60.56s:  covered strangle here that we're going to be talking about in T triple Q's, this is the position
65.92s:  as it sits today. So you'll see that right now, this is all part of a model portfolio. I've kind
72.72s:  of taken my main portfolio and broken out a couple chunks to trade the covered strangle in a
78.80s:  couple different sizes that are more relevant to kind of just general people building out their
84.00s:  accounts. And so right now the covered strangle on T triple Q's is combined with 500 shares.
93.52s:  So there's an equity position. Then there are two trances of short puts. This is obviously a short
101.04s:  put position. And then there's the short call element. Now today, I'm going to be focusing on
107.84s:  the rolling of the short puts. And that's because especially in something like in leveraged ETF,
114.40s:  it is a delicate balance. Why is it a delicate balance? Well, this is why. Because if you take a look at
120.48s:  the overall price performance of something like QQQ and we zoom this out, let's do a three year
127.60s:  daily. You'll notice that it goes through different periods where it can have these very broad,
132.88s:  nasty, turn downs. In this case, this represents a 34% decline. If we look here, this is a 41% decline.
140.96s:  This one is 23 and a half. This one is 32.8. This one's 35. It looks smaller because of the scale,
149.84s:  but it's not. It's a 35% drop. This is 58. This total drop here from Pete the Trow.
158.32s:  This one here is 64. This move here, like this total move is massive. We take a look at that total
166.80s:  move. It's 73.6%. So the broader content here is that the tickers like this move a lot. And the way
178.00s:  that we choose to manage our positions around them is essential to the success of the strategy.
185.12s:  One of the primary ways that the covered strangle performs so well is because as the market is going
191.84s:  down, I use the strategy to turn a profit of the option side of the equation. And then when it begins
199.12s:  to rally during this period, I'm dollar cost averaging into it very carefully. And then as it rallies
205.60s:  up and out, I have a really great basis that takes advantage of the eventual recovery.
211.36s:  So the broader context here is the management of the short puts is literally essential.
217.12s:  So one of the things that I want to direct your attention to are creating the objectives for the
223.60s:  role. What are we trying to do? And there's typically two broad buckets that I think about.
228.96s:  The first bucket is maximizing profit potential. The second bucket is maximizing basis reduction.
238.00s:  Now as it pertains to the strategies that we're talking about here, I am focusing on basis
243.04s:  reduction. Why? Well, it is for this context that I was actually showing you a little bit earlier.
251.12s:  It's because if we take a look at the frequency of various size moves in both SSO and T triple
256.64s:  cues, you can see that on a monthly timeframe, they can have pretty significant moves.
262.72s:  Greater than 40% is not supremely infrequent. It's infrequent, but not supremely infrequent.
271.12s:  So because of that, the way that I apply the mental model to these short puts that we're going over
277.28s:  now is very much from the context of how can I continually reduce the basis of the options so that I
287.76s:  can be in a better, in better spot to take advantage during the eventual recovery. So let's take a
293.52s:  look at an example here in T triple cues. So on T triple cues, you can see on the 12th of Feb,
299.44s:  I had sold five of the 78 strike puts expiring again 21 March for 293. So let's go to 12 Feb
310.24s:  and let's see what this looked like when I entered it. So 12 Feb is right here. This is in the face,
318.72s:  almost top ticked it, real good at that. This is in the face of a pretty significant decline.
324.40s:  So if we take a look at what the underlying has done since I got in, it rallied up and then it is
330.48s:  essentially just concentrate down. So what is the state of these puts? Well, I had to take them down.
337.44s:  I took them down for $10.25 on the 4th of March. So let's take a look at the 4th of March
344.72s:  and let's see what happened then. So again, this is the entry point here and then the 4th of March
351.04s:  is right here. So the reason why they needed to be adjusted on the 4th of March is because I was running
358.40s:  out of X transit value. The risk of early assignment was starting to grow. So that's why I took
364.96s:  them down. And again, what I told you I took them down for was that $10 and 25 cents. So now,
376.56s:  what's the next step? Well, again, going back to the first objective, the stock has gone down 24.1
382.72s:  percent since I got in. My objective here is to reduce the basis to try to manage my basis as
389.36s:  best as I can. And I committed one of the big mistakes that you're not supposed to do with options,
395.92s:  but this is typically by people who don't understand them. And I actually rolled it for a debit.
401.68s:  That means that I closed this option for $10 and 25 cents. And then I opened a new one for $9 and
407.92s:  80 cents. Why would I do that? Well, it's because net net. This is still a premium, meaning I'm still
416.48s:  collecting a credit. If we take a look at the series of transactions here, I took in 1465,
422.48s:  I then closed out for 51 25. And then I opened up the new ones for $4,900. So that still nets me out
430.08s:  in a positive position. And the big thing that was accomplished here was adjusting the strike
436.56s:  nearly 4%. I took my basis from 78 down to 75. So not only does this reduce the basis pretty massively,
448.00s:  but it also positions me to be able to take on a larger position because the covered
453.68s:  strangle requirement has gone from 39,000 now to 37,500. I can afford more of the underlying.
463.60s:  The reason why that matters is going back to the original example of being able to effectively
469.84s:  dollar cost average in to the underlying, in this case, T triple queues as it goes down.
477.20s:  If we take a look at some rough math that I just sketched in here, the difference of these two is
482.80s:  that 1,500 bucks with T triple queues currently trading at 61 89 that literally represents an
488.64s:  additional 24 shares that can be purchased at spot price through this reduction. So that is one
495.28s:  of the big things I'm paying attention to. Notice how I did not add any size here. Why did I not add
500.88s:  size? Because we are still potentially in the very early stages of a decline. Do I think T triple
508.08s:  queues is going to have another 82% decline right now? I personally don't, but just because I don't
514.32s:  think that's what's going to happen doesn't mean that it can't happen or something worse.
518.88s:  So what I'm doing is I'm thinking very carefully not just about what is happening right now,
525.04s:  but then what can happen with the position as we go further out in time. And this is why I am so
531.36s:  aggressively attempting to manage basis because what eventually happens is if this strike becomes
538.16s:  too buried, meaning too far in the money. And the underlying continues to go down. It becomes next
544.24s:  to impossible to continue rolling it out or a credit or even something that still yields a profitable
551.12s:  position post roll. So then that means you either have to choose to take assignment, but if your
555.92s:  basis is too high, then it really doesn't help improve your position much. So then you're just tying
561.92s:  up money and something that's not moving. So my goal is to be aggressive upfront. This does come
567.52s:  at the cost of total profitability, but right now I am heavily prioritizing the basis adjustment
574.96s:  element of this trade. So that's the game plan as it sits. This is one of the main concepts that
582.48s:  goes into rolling short puts with respect to leveraged products is having a tight game plan on how
591.76s:  we intend to manage it by understanding the actual flow of premium as it pertains to the position.
598.08s:  And I have another video that talks about rolling options in detail. I will absolutely share a link to
604.64s:  that in the notes below. And as always, if you have any questions, let me know. Be an outlier. See you
