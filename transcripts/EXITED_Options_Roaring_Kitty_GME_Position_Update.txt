0.88s: we're back again with a new update and
2.44s: naturally re-shooting this video because
4.12s: raring Kitty literally just released his
6.24s: updated position answering a lot of
8.28s: questions so couple quick admin notes
10.88s: first off shout out to the Apes again
13.08s: I'm having a blast learning about what's
15.40s: going on here with you guys and it looks
17.76s: like unfortunately the option side of
20.04s: the equation might have just been
22.48s: removed which we'll get into his
24.20s: portfolio in just a second but funny
26.44s: enough today was supposed to be the
28.28s: GameStop shareholders meeting in and
30.32s: because so many of you were feverishly
32.84s: trying to join they literally couldn't
34.40s: support it so they had to postpone it
35.68s: which was interesting all right let's
38.28s: get into now the new position so this is
41.80s: essentially what I was talking about in
44.24s: the video I'm re-shooting right now what
46.72s: could have all happened here and all of
48.64s: this summarizes to my hypothesis at the
51.08s: time was that he was pairing this down
53.52s: and moving into equity and the reason
56.40s: why I thought that is because when I
58.20s: look at the options chains which can
60.56s: tell us a lot I know raring Kitty is
63.68s: aggressive but I also don't think that
66.24s: he's quite to the point where he's just
68.32s: lighting money on fire I think he's
69.84s: trying to be purposeful about what he's
71.36s: doing to increase his impact and if we
74.08s: take a look at the positions here I
77.44s: noticed way more volume today again in
80.96s: his 20 strike previously and then if we
83.60s: take a look at the 14 Junes there's a
85.96s: ton of new new volume here but
90.48s: this doesn't seem like his M Mo and the
93.92s: reason being is because this expires so
95.56s: short with the position that size it
97.32s: would really be difficult for him to
99.04s: manage essentially what he's trying to
100.80s: do or what I think he's trying to do so
103.72s: what do we end up seeing well this this
106.88s: is what it is as of like 10 minutes ago
109.72s: so as we can see his entire call
112.60s: position is now taken down and he's
114.84s: essentially moved from 5 million shares
118.52s: to 9 million and 1,000 shares which if
121.56s: I'm not mistaken is the same amount that
123.28s: Ryan Cohen has interestingly enough and
125.92s: I think that goes back to a little bit
128.24s: of what we saw on that Meme he did a
130.24s: couple days ago from the office you know
133.28s: with GameStop on the one dude's chest
134.96s: and then the little cat on Michael
136.32s: Scott's chest so now the price he paid
139.52s: you could tell obviously he was bit up a
141.56s: little bit and it's also very clear that
144.24s: he actually didn't exercise these
146.08s: options in this case these 20s they
148.68s: still had over 20 cents of Time Value
151.24s: which isn't a ton to be clear but when
153.32s: you're talking about 12 million shares
155.56s: that's actually a lot of money like 3
157.88s: million doar so he wasn't just going to
160.60s: throw that away I think he simply
163.04s: liquidated this position over the last
165.20s: few days which we can see represented in
166.92s: the volume like 90 something, volume
170.12s: yesterday and then today it's another 40
172.48s: something thousand which again that
174.12s: would pretty much Clear him right out
176.48s: and it looks like he used those proceeds
179.36s: and wrote rotated into this the other
180.96s: thing is take a look at the cash
182.00s: reserves they've come down a lot they
183.80s: were
184.76s: 29.4 million now they're at 6.3 million
188.16s: the other thing that this tells me very
189.88s: clearly this is clearly not a mistake
192.92s: it's not happen stance because notice
195.80s: the number he selected again I that's
198.24s: very purposeful and you could tell just
200.16s: by the way he's placing these positions
203.60s: so what's next well we have to see
205.76s: because the expiration next week and the
208.88s: expirations tomorrow actually get really
210.84s: interesting now because if we take a
212.60s: look at the implied volatility for both
214.40s: of them they're so jacked compared to
217.96s: everything else that we see 384 to 281
221.32s: per. there's still a lot of options out
223.80s: there but with his liquidation you're
225.80s: going to see the call oi come down a bit
229.52s: again but there's been so much feverish
232.32s: new entry on this side I'm also curious
235.92s: how updated the screenshot is because it
238.36s: wouldn't be outside the realm of
239.80s: possibility for this said uh never mind
242.36s: I just corrected myself I realized this
243.92s: is at the close because it closed at
245.48s: 2912 so never mind we'll see if he
248.92s: potentially rotates back into options I
251.00s: would love that as you could tell CU
252.40s: that's that's my side of the business
253.68s: here and I have a blast following along
255.80s: with that but so far this is what it
258.44s: looks like he has his shares now and
260.56s: we'll see where we go I'm going to
262.04s: eagerly be following along with you guys
263.60s: at this point cuz I can't help but be
265.40s: fascinated but most of the questions now
268.20s: are answered we are out of option into
270.40s: shares if you have any questions or
271.76s: anything I can help with let me know see
273.72s: you guys later
