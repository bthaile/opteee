2.48s: what's up everybody Eric here welcome
4.00s: back to the outlier pack podcast and I
6.12s: have my friends here from doomberg and
9.08s: there's no shortage of Doom going on in
11.04s: the world today so there's a bunch of
12.72s: topics I have queued up for us today but
15.04s: first off welcome back it's great to
17.04s: connect with you again Eric real
18.76s: pleasure to be here thoroughly enjoyed
20.32s: uh first appearance and looking forward
21.76s: to another fantastic one as we wrap up
23.36s: another interesting week in the world
25.48s: yeah interesting week I I like the the
27.56s: framing there um so before we kind of
30.64s: talk about economic events and whatnot I
32.40s: was we right before we started recording
34.88s: I was talking to you a bit about the
36.04s: post I was reading from you guys from
38.08s: your substack it's from the 2nd of
40.60s: August it's called notes on X and it
43.28s: kind of just talks about your guys'
45.04s: experience when Elon mus took over
46.64s: Twitter and then all the subsequent
48.36s: changes and the impacts that that had to
50.84s: your business and like I was explaining
53.08s: to you from my perspective I was kind of
55.88s: just watching the show because really
57.92s: there's very little impact to me but but
60.20s: reading your perspective was very eye
62.56s: openening on how like jarring a lot of
65.28s: that was so I actually had a few follow-
67.56s: on questions but kind of to level set
69.56s: with the broader audience what's like
72.40s: the highlevel impact in case somebody
74.52s: didn't catch that article which I will
76.12s: link for them to check out yeah sure
78.68s: we're um we're professional content
80.32s: creators now doomberg is the work of our
81.84s: lives this is um how we make our living
84.72s: how we feed our families and um and
86.84s: support our sort of economic well-being
88.92s: and when the new owner of Twitter took
90.92s: over um he had uh you know at
95.12s: least in secret but then eventually made
97.64s: public that he viewed substack as one of
99.72s: the key potential future competitors to
102.12s: Twitter and what he envisioned Twitter
103.60s: would be which is fine um he is the
106.12s: owner of that platform it's his private
108.04s: property he certainly paid enough for it
109.92s: u s paid enough for it to have the right
111.68s: to do what he wants with it um and so it
114.76s: began with some throttling of substack
117.08s: authors and links to substack and then
118.88s: eventually it it just felt like the
121.28s: algorithm was targeting substack in
123.84s: general and then large
125.88s: substack accounts like ours in
128.20s: particular and and our Impressions and
130.96s: engagement on the platform collapsed
132.76s: even though we hadn't really materially
134.32s: changed our efforts to try and you know
137.48s: to create good content for our followers
139.08s: you know at the time that we left
140.12s: Twitter we had over a quarter million
142.36s: followers we worked really hard to build
145.00s: up that followship to create that
147.52s: account to add value to our followers
150.76s: occasionally potentially induce them to
152.84s: come on over to substack and read a
154.16s: piece of ours and maybe that would
155.36s: eventually lead them to become a
156.56s: subscriber and you know the customer
158.28s: journey in the content space is
159.56s: impression to engagement to email debate
161.52s: and and we spent a lot of time
163.40s: generating as many Impressions on
164.68s: Twitter as we could but at at a at some
166.52s: point um we were in Denow for a few
168.56s: months when your impressions collapse
170.72s: 90% and you're putting the same amount
172.20s: of effort and maybe it's time to
173.36s: redirect your effort and and we're a
174.72s: very small team we have a finite amount
176.96s: of hours in the day it didn't be it it
178.80s: became no fun
181.00s: and so we just left and then we decided
182.52s: to go all in on substack which is you
184.08s: know our partners and um you know we
186.84s: don't take it personally of course new
188.16s: owner of Twitter can do what he wants
189.32s: with this platform as we said in that
190.72s: piece and and so you know in our mind um
193.64s: subc has been our partners from the
194.84s: beginning and then like you know we
196.32s: would much rather lose with our partners
197.92s: than win with an antagonist in this case
200.56s: even if that antagonism isn't personal
202.36s: it's just business sure yeah it's just
204.52s: kind of a disruptor for you guys one of
206.20s: the things I was curious about is like
207.68s: in the content business we talked a lot
209.36s: of
210.40s: last time about your guys's approach to
212.08s: content because I just find it
213.32s: interesting but one of the things I'm
216.04s: curious how you guys approach is the
218.96s: idea of like being able to actually you
221.12s: know quote unquote own your audience
224.44s: right because as long as you guys exist
227.48s: through these other platforms that risk
229.88s: always exists so is that just kind of
231.60s: something that you accept as a potential
233.48s: risk and then as you are now adjusting
235.28s: as needed or is that something that
236.76s: you're thinking further out into and
238.36s: figuring out ways to actually own the
240.60s: relationship with the audience not
242.08s: through the service of another platform
244.16s: that's the wonderful thing about
245.00s: substack is in fact we do own our
246.44s: audience we we own our email list it's
249.64s: ours um we could leave substack tomorrow
252.56s: and our subscribers wouldn't notice very
254.68s: much maybe our email delivery system
256.44s: might change but we own the relationship
259.40s: with our customers via the payment
261.68s: processor as well we have a separate
264.44s: account um on stripe which is the the uh
267.76s: exclusive payment processor for the
269.20s: subst
270.20s: ecosystem and substack you know probably
273.00s: to the Chagrin of its investors has been
275.68s: extraordinarily generous with its author
278.16s: Partners in that regard they've always
280.64s: viewed their job to more than Delight us
284.76s: and in exchange we would stay with them
286.88s: because it's a great deal and frankly it
288.44s: is a great deal you know somebody posted
289.92s: on notes which is substack version of
292.64s: Twitter that we now post exclusively on
295.24s: asking us whether we pay the full 10% to
298.40s: substack and boy that sure seems like an
300.68s: awful lot for you know a basically an
304.04s: editing software and a MailChimp
305.60s: knockoff and um and we said yes we do
307.92s: and it's worth every penny because it's
309.56s: not it's way more than that um it
312.16s: they're our business partners and their
313.56s: 10% is what we agreed to pay them in the
316.16s: event that we succeeded and we're not
317.76s: you know we're people of our word but
319.56s: beyond that um subsec has 30 million
321.76s: emails in its ecosystem and it has
323.28s: really great discoverability tools and
325.00s: it's starting to gain critical mass you
327.36s: know their mission is to change the way
329.60s: people read on the internet and to
331.20s: improve the tone of discourse
333.80s: online and if you are a paying
336.04s: subscriber to doomberg you get access to
337.56s: our comment section and with every piece
339.56s: that we write we get hundreds of really
341.44s: intelligent links and questions and and
344.44s: I'm on there all the time I'm personally
346.68s: answering every comment and um and they
350.48s: know like it's the doomberg headwriter
352.32s: that is also engaging in the comment
354.36s: section and then you know we have almost
356.96s: 200,000 emails um that on our subscriber
360.32s: list that's that's an audience that well
362.64s: we don't own but we have we own the
364.72s: right to Delight them uh and we we
367.20s: certainly have direct access to them we
368.96s: can email them directly and I think
371.28s: substack is changing the way social
374.08s: media properties interact with their
376.96s: main you know contributors you know
379.24s: there's there's three types of people on
380.92s: social media there's sort of the the
382.52s: lurkers and the and the occasional
384.88s: contributors and then sort of the power
386.12s: users the the creators and the theque
389.48s: need a critical mass of creators for a
391.20s: social media platform to work like if
393.28s: Facebook or Instagram or nothing more
395.76s: than just your friends it get pretty
397.12s: boring after a while but you can go and
398.68s: you could follow celebrities and
400.36s: athletes and musicians and and experts
403.20s: in various fields and and interact with
405.08s: them directly which is the magic of of
408.08s: social media it's also the thing that
409.96s: makes Twitter a little bit toxic um and
413.20s: so you know that that it really is an
414.92s: amazing thing that substack is trying to
416.20s: do we certainly hope they succeed we're
417.68s: we're investors in substack and and
419.52s: obviously we're all
420.72s: in yeah yeah it's awesome and that's
423.08s: kind of one of the reasons why I wanted
424.44s: to dive into that question because
425.72s: substack is one of those interesting
428.04s: platforms where exactly to your point it
429.68s: seems like there's a a portion email
431.76s: list that you guys don't outright and
433.60s: then you know there's still pieces that
435.64s: go through the platform like the notes
436.92s: section and whatnot um so it's very
440.00s: interesting to me to understand how you
441.84s: view those different kinds of
443.64s: interactions with your audience and
445.44s: where you're waiting your efforts and
447.16s: how you've used sub substacks capacity
449.16s: to deliver on that so well let's take
451.84s: let's take you for example I mean you
453.36s: could deliver your podcast through
455.88s: substack um and in so doing you would
458.88s: collect emails of people who are
460.84s: interested to heal your podcast and that
462.80s: as a Creator an email is is is way more
466.36s: valuable than a follow or a subscribe on
468.88s: YouTube for example um and so I don't
471.56s: know why anybody who's on YouTube isn't
473.20s: also on
475.00s: substack because you get you know
477.28s: basically you get this amazing
479.96s: direct contact with people who are
481.76s: self-identifying as wanting more of your
484.20s: content you know uh and so it's a really
487.68s: I think a a magical place and and to be
490.88s: clear subag has a far
494.12s: more um
496.88s: cultural alignment with freedom of
499.16s: speech than the traditional social media
502.00s: platforms they're very hesitant to um to
506.04s: censor or to remove content you know I
508.72s: we cure create our own comment section
510.64s: for example because it's you know behind
512.08s: a pay wall and so it's a lot easier to
514.64s: handle U we like to say you control us
516.96s: but you have to pay for the privilege
518.36s: but um but like we will occasionally
520.92s: delete a a comment that's out of line uh
523.68s: we don't want to be the owners of our
525.76s: subscribers comments but at the same
527.24s: time like it it we want our comment
528.88s: section to be a curated place of
530.76s: learning and engagement then by and
533.00s: large that's what it is and it's really
534.36s: a wonderful thing and so like if I were
535.88s: you I I would be Distributing your
539.64s: podcast as video through the substack
541.60s: platform and and identifying the people
544.28s: who really want to you know circumvent
546.20s: the YouTube um algorithm and and and
548.36s: contact them
549.44s: directly yeah yeah it's actually a
551.40s: really interesting idea from my
553.40s: perspective because exactly what you're
554.76s: talking about one of the cool Parts I
556.24s: found with the podcast in general is the
558.64s: ability to put it a bunch of different
560.44s: places like I just started putting it on
562.08s: Spotify and whatnot because it's no
563.52s: extra work it's just uploading another
565.00s: spot but it's a good point um so pivot
569.68s: over now kind of to what the world looks
574.12s: like today if you were to summarize the
577.84s: three largest global factors that are
581.48s: that are of interest to you guys what
583.48s: are they and why uh number one the
586.36s: situation in the Middle East and whether
587.96s: or not the war spreads Beyond Gaza I
590.32s: think that's the most urgent important
593.76s: difficult to to take apart as an
595.76s: outsider you know the geopolitical risk
597.96s: on the board you know whether you know
600.24s: hezb from the North and then you know
602.16s: the US and in Syria and then maybe you
604.80s: know lindsy Graham gets us away and we
606.12s: start carpet bombing Iranian oil
608.72s: facilities now all bets are off I think
610.88s: for um you know for risk in the markets
614.48s: and in particular oil of course and in
616.12s: the commodity markets um number two is
619.08s: um the war in Ukraine I think um very
623.68s: few people have on their uh on their uh
627.88s: scorecards here at the potential for a a
631.16s: collapse of the zinsky regime it's not
632.88s: something we've written about but it's
633.88s: something we've been studying and and
635.24s: potentially thinking about writing I
636.84s: think things aren't going nearly as well
639.48s: in Ukraine as the West would have us
641.76s: believe and I think that um that these
646.00s: types of things tend to resolve uh at a
648.88s: speed that surprises people no matter
650.76s: how many times it happens and then third
653.12s: is obviously tensions between China and
654.88s: the US I I we're paying close attention
657.00s: to the prospect of um XII ping
659.72s: flying to San Francisco here um for a
662.20s: conference which would be I think
664.20s: potentially a positive development but
665.92s: the intentions over Taiwan the chip Wars
669.72s: um TI fortat trade war that seems to be
672.16s: escalating but still simmering a little
674.24s: bit below the ktic surface as we might
676.56s: say those are the three things in order
678.44s: I think were one headline away from you
681.80s: know catastrophe in the Middle East I
683.76s: think um I think the Ukraine war is
687.04s: putting Europe in a very very bad
688.36s: situation and
689.60s: obviously if if the US and China could
691.96s: resolve their tensions um that would
693.60s: obviously be bullish so so we shall see
695.60s: but those are the three just uh off the
698.12s: top of my head first time hearing the
699.76s: question that that we would be paying
701.52s: very close attention to got it well if I
704.56s: could give myself a score I got two out
707.60s: of three so the first one I wrote down
710.44s: that I wanted to talk to you about was
711.60s: Israel Hamas the second one was Russia
713.36s: Ukraine I did not include China us I
716.72s: missed that one but I'm pretty stoked I
720.40s: got two out of three what did you
722.00s: include just out of curiosity might be
723.44s: our fourth well um so after that I have
726.76s: H Fed rate policies recession energy
729.56s: Warfare CU I really like that article
731.48s: that you guys wrote um those were the
734.16s: next kind of handful that I had listed
735.76s: out yeah yeah well what let's take them
738.40s: in order how where do you want to go
740.40s: yeah well definitely Israel first and
743.72s: the reason why definitely Israel first
745.48s: is because like I'm still on the
746.68s: reserves so I follow this stuff very
749.28s: closely obviously and the overall
753.00s: relationship there is so fascinating to
755.64s: me against the backdrop of the typical
757.96s: American perspective which not to talk
761.04s: down about ourselves but it tends to be
763.28s: pretty ignorant I feel like Americans
764.88s: are used to being in our own little
766.60s: bubble and we sometimes forget that
769.60s: other people have other perspectives so
772.52s: looking at what's going on over there I
774.52s: think is very important but also
778.88s: misunderstood by a lot of people so can
781.88s: you talk from your
783.64s: perspective what's going on there and
786.20s: then the potential larger scale impact
788.84s: so I think it's very important to State
790.16s: up front but I know I am not an expert
793.76s: on the Israeli Palestinian conflict I'm
797.12s: superficially knowledgeable about it and
799.56s: and I think it's important when analysts
801.88s: are on podcasts like this to State
803.40s: upfront whether they have any particular
804.88s: expertise to add so for example I'm far
807.12s: more comfortable pontificating about the
809.00s: nuances of uh you know l& market and
812.00s: natural gas than I am uh about the the
815.08s: causes and consequences of the most
816.88s: recent um events in Israel now of course
819.72s: any outside human can look at this
821.76s: situation and be appalled at the events
823.64s: of October 7th and we certainly were and
826.28s: also be afraid uh of the of the risks
829.60s: involved and that this is a very very
831.36s: serious event and I think that the
834.24s: commodity markets in particular might be
836.68s: underpricing the tail risk of of a
839.56s: spreading of this war in the same way
841.72s: that it did uh in the weeks ahead of
844.76s: Putin's initial moves on Ukraine and we
848.00s: are uh of course we're defensive
849.76s: pessimists and and we Ponder worst case
851.92s: narrow risks and so when situations like
854.00s: these explode we are of course our
856.56s: instinct is to is to ponder worst case
858.52s: scenario risk we are looking closely at
862.80s: escalation from the north with Hezbollah
865.80s: and with Iran via proxies and Syria
868.36s: initi but whether that kinetic battle
871.76s: you know um spreads to direct conflict
874.40s: with Iran obviously there's some very
876.84s: narrow Straits over there through which
878.24s: an awful lot of energy is shipped and if
881.08s: those were to be uh interfered with it
883.44s: could cause huge dislocations in the
885.16s: market um I have no idea how to solve
888.04s: the Israeli Palestinian conflict I think
889.88s: it is a tragedy of Epic
892.92s: Proportions um it is uh you know it
897.32s: is really just there's no other way to
899.68s: say it it is it is sad that in 2023
903.88s: humans are still capable of doing that
906.28s: to each other what we saw on the 7th for
908.52s: example and it's disturbing um now
912.60s: Israel's response and whether they've
914.40s: gone too far and the humanitarian crisis
916.52s: and whether we get a pause or a
918.76s: ceasefire these are all well beyond our
920.96s: expertise to to to really go into any
924.00s: great detail and I I just think it's
925.28s: important to say that like I don't know
927.08s: um but I do know that if if conflict
929.24s: spreads the consequences would be
931.68s: devastating and Swift and and the
933.40s: transfer mechanism through which the
935.56s: economic impacts would spread to the
936.96s: rest of the world are pretty well known
939.44s: um and so uh one of the things we did
941.36s: write about though was was to contribute
943.40s: a piece about the US political situation
945.44s: and how the divided house you know the
948.12s: Republican party's divisions could
950.60s: actually choke off supply of uh funds
953.48s: and military equipment to Ukraine which
954.92s: in fact has played out since we wrote
957.04s: that piece um I believe it was called
958.92s: Minority Report um it is just
962.08s: undeniable that in the US domestic
964.56s: political situation which we do know
966.04s: something about support for Israel is
968.28s: far far more uniform and and United
971.56s: let's say uh and strong than it is for
974.12s: Ukraine Ukraine has become a political
976.48s: Battleground for the 2024 elections the
979.16s: Republicans many of whom you know for
982.96s: whatever motivation wouldn't mind
984.32s: hanging a loss on Biden ahead of the
986.28s: 2024 elections and I think the need to
989.40s: supply um arms and funding to Israel is
992.48s: great cover for them to choke off Supply
994.32s: to Ukraine and that's what we're seeing
996.16s: and and in the peace minor report we
997.84s: mentioned how Pelosi had kind of stabbed
1000.88s: McCarthy in the back and that was a
1002.12s: decision that she might come to regret
1003.48s: because whoever would replace him would
1004.88s: be less malleable than McCarthy on these
1007.28s: issues and of course we see that
1009.24s: McCarthy's replacement is in fact very
1010.96s: much further to the right than he was
1012.56s: and and looks less ready to cut a deal
1014.68s: on Ukraine so that that's you to the
1017.36s: extent that the Middle East imp acts
1018.68s: Ukraine and that's a domino that affects
1020.20s: European energy there we can begin to be
1022.76s: more comfortable about speculating but
1024.24s: you know how the decades long conflict
1026.84s: between Israel and pal Palestinians you
1028.80s: know resolves is well above our pay grid
1031.44s: sure yeah well and I always try to
1033.60s: remind people that although we have like
1035.52s: this veneer of Civility conflict has
1038.68s: always been there I don't see it going
1040.88s: anywhere I I see it continuing to change
1043.00s: and evolve but you know like you were
1044.60s: saying it's kind of like sad and
1046.48s: appalling and I I totally get that
1048.00s: perspective
1049.28s: I think from at least from a military
1051.20s: standpoint none of this is shocking it's
1053.40s: kind of slightly different than what
1055.16s: we've seen before as it typically
1056.60s: continues to be but humans are humans um
1060.28s: now you mentioned one thing that I do
1062.80s: want to dive a little bit further into
1064.28s: on that first topic though is kind of
1066.08s: the the potential for the conflict to
1068.56s: spread do you have any hypothesis on
1071.12s: primary catalysts for that or what that
1073.56s: could look like if it were to play out
1077.00s: well it should be said and I hope this
1079.00s: isn't controversial there is a faction
1080.64s: in the US that really wants war with
1082.48s: Iran and has wanted war with Iran for a
1085.20s: very long time um The neocon Wing of of
1088.60s: both parties frankly I think it is
1090.48s: bipartisan um the the Hudson Institute
1092.96s: crowd has been angling for conflict with
1095.84s: Iran for some time I don't know why um
1098.72s: seems like a full heartly full hearty
1100.96s: Endeavor you know I don't know how many
1102.52s: wars we need to lose before we decide
1105.24s: that maybe uh we should be more
1107.00s: selective uh in engaging in Wars um you
1111.16s: know the Ukraine situation is not going
1112.84s: well this comes on the heels of of the I
1115.36s: think scandalous exit from Afghanistan
1118.12s: and and the situation in Libya and Iraq
1120.72s: I mean it's for all of the heroics and
1122.60s: the sacrifice of the of the US U Soldier
1127.00s: um what do we have to show for the the
1129.04s: sacrifices is I think a conversation we
1131.12s: need to have and so I would argue that
1134.28s: while we are engaging in a proxy war
1135.96s: with Ukraine and provoking a trade War
1138.40s: with China um is it really smart to open
1140.52s: up a kinetic war with Iran I mean I it I
1143.20s: don't know uh maybe I'm just you know a
1145.20s: pacifist I'm old enough to remember when
1147.88s: um being in the pro peace Camp was
1150.04s: considered liberal uh almost borderline
1152.32s: treacherous and now it's considered um
1154.28s: alt-right Putin puppet uh I don't know I
1157.32s: as as the father of um of draft eligible
1159.92s: children I I I would prefer that at
1162.16s: least we had a debate in Congress before
1163.80s: we declared war and um and we thought
1166.44s: about the consequences the objectives
1168.04s: and and the limits that we would place
1170.92s: on the military as we engage in these
1172.56s: things but there's there's a faction of
1173.96s: people in the US that want war the ran
1175.96s: and I think a way this war spreads is we
1178.12s: um we provoke them or um we um we we
1182.04s: have sort of a Gul tunen incident where
1183.92s: something happens and it gets blown up
1185.60s: by Propaganda next thing you know the
1188.08s: the the war cries are whipped up
1190.76s: internally and and uh off we go and sad
1194.00s: I I'm I'm unabashedly proce unabashedly
1199.32s: um Pro us I think it'd be really great
1202.16s: if our National Defense focused on
1203.76s: defending us as opposed to proactively
1206.44s: finding Wars to go and uh and drop bombs
1208.56s: on people you know I guess when you're
1209.60s: in the bomb making business piece is a
1211.68s: working capital problem it's sad but um
1214.36s: you know and and I'm sure we'll catch
1215.76s: some plaque for saying these things but
1217.28s: we would be very much uh inward focused
1220.04s: in our resource deployment um investing
1222.80s: in our domestic economy on our um you
1226.20s: know our domestic entitlements our
1227.76s: domestic border security and letting the
1230.52s: rest of the world figure out what they
1231.60s: want to do with each
1233.12s: other yeah it's an interesting
1235.28s: perspective so do you guys think that
1237.48s: there's a way to operate in isolationism
1240.32s: like that because when I hear those
1241.72s: kinds of things I honestly don't have
1244.20s: much of a perspective myself I I
1245.80s: genuinely view myself as too ignorant to
1247.80s: have an educated opinion on it I always
1249.88s: just look at the problem set and think
1251.40s: how tricky it is balance internal
1255.20s: internal Investments and internal
1257.40s: infrastructure internal Focus versus
1260.12s: forward projections for the purpose of
1263.04s: internal Loy of control so I'm curious
1266.20s: how you guys think about like that
1268.52s: isolationism concept and the ability to
1270.72s: look more Inward and I don't want to say
1272.80s: forsake But Metal less
1276.36s: externally I think look you could forget
1278.72s: about just isolating the country you
1280.44s: could say the Western hemisphere is off
1282.04s: limits we could easily enforce that that
1285.28s: if you drew a circle around NAFTA I mean
1287.16s: there's plenty of food and fertilizer
1289.00s: and water and resources and oil and gas
1291.32s: and coal and you
1294.24s: know I understand that we have allies
1296.76s: around the world and that we have
1297.84s: principles and so on and um but at some
1301.48s: point you know if we're not going to be
1304.28s: the global
1305.60s: superpower um which we're kind of
1308.12s: pulling back we're we're sort of sending
1309.48s: mixed messages to the world right I mean
1311.04s: like we're pulling out of these places
1313.12s: but at the same time we are sort of
1314.76s: commanding and demanding the same level
1316.60s: of respect um that that we used to have
1318.68s: when we were the truly dominant
1320.84s: superpower and and I would argue that we
1322.92s: have um
1324.04s: underestimated the military might of our
1326.24s: opponents and um it's okay to treat um
1330.16s: other cultures as um people to deal with
1332.80s: sort of on a peer basis um I I don't I
1336.32s: I'd be hardpressed to believe that the
1337.40s: rest of the world wakes up every day
1338.48s: looking to go to war with the
1340.60s: US um I maybe I'm naive and look it's
1343.24s: totally possible I'm naive and I'm sure
1344.36s: there are people listening who who will
1345.64s: say that um I think we got plenty of s
1348.24s: at
1348.92s: home before we we we go about the world
1352.36s: searching for other people's problems to
1353.88s: solve um I don't know that's just me do
1357.28s: you think that's what the US is doing
1358.96s: that they're trying to look to solve
1360.48s: other people's problem for them or do
1362.96s: you think that it's more the US is
1365.04s: looking to interfere in other places and
1367.04s: solve problems that might come back and
1370.00s: impact us well that would be the neocon
1372.52s: argument that you know better to fight
1374.24s: over there than fight over here um I
1376.44s: find that argument unpersuasive
1378.96s: uh but again nobody comes in duberg to
1380.32s: read these things this is not really in
1381.64s: our zone of expertise I'm more
1382.88s: expressing my personal opinion yeah of
1384.68s: course than anything we would write
1386.04s: about um but that's the argument that
1388.08s: the neocons make is best to fight Iran
1389.84s: and Iran and my thought would be how
1391.32s: about we just don't fight Iran like how
1393.08s: about we figure out a way to reach some
1394.76s: kind of a workable relationship with
1396.20s: Iran with China with Russia heaven
1397.88s: forbid um you know but there's the view
1401.76s: that um all of these countries are out
1404.20s: to get the us and that we need to
1406.52s: proactively go and but what's the end
1408.16s: point like what we're going to Nuke all
1409.60s: these people what is the end point of a
1411.48s: war with Iran Eric you tell me like what
1413.60s: does Victory look like in that SC you
1416.28s: know Iran is the largest producer of oil
1419.12s: for China right now China's import the
1420.92s: largest importer of oil into China comes
1422.56s: from Iran today that's new a recent
1424.28s: development we go to war with the r what
1426.04s: do you think China thinks when it looks
1427.40s: at Taiwan and it looks at at its
1428.80s: internal strategic petroleum
1430.44s: reserves like how many wars do we want
1432.88s: like to what end what's the point like
1435.08s: it's called National Security does this
1437.24s: improve or decre increase our national
1439.80s: security I don't know I mean at some
1441.80s: point we need to have a conversation
1444.12s: like again how many wars do we want to
1445.60s: lose it's not like we have a glorious
1447.88s: track record since Vietnam in this
1451.04s: regard find me a place in the world
1453.28s: where our military action resulted in a
1455.20s: better situation than that exists today
1457.08s: look at at least at the end of World War
1458.56s: II look at West Germany and Japan and
1460.76s: the Reconstruction of of Europe like
1463.20s: those were Wars worth winning and we
1466.04s: meaningfully invested in the longevity
1468.68s: of the
1469.60s: outcome what's what's Afghanistan today
1471.76s: what's Iraq today how many trillions do
1474.12s: we spend on these wars I don't know it
1476.84s: but again it it's it's our views on this
1479.44s: aren't going to change anything that
1481.60s: that's where I would land personally
1484.16s: yeah yeah no and I ask the questions
1486.04s: because I find it interesting right
1487.32s: that's the whole idea is to promulgate
1489.52s: different perspectives and to learn more
1491.08s: I think a lot of what you say is there's
1493.52s: a lot of great thought behind it in my
1495.68s: opinion because I agree with you I think
1497.00s: the idea of like starting Conflict for
1499.16s: the sake of it doesn't necessarily help
1501.84s: most people which is always why I go
1503.28s: back to like I'm curious always like
1505.44s: what the the true undertones are and if
1507.24s: it's kind of what what you're talking
1508.52s: about and it very well could be the case
1510.36s: where it's just the the large war
1512.28s: machine needs Conflict for profit yeah
1515.52s: like that that very very has a big seat
1519.76s: at the table you can go back to Dwight
1521.56s: Eisenhower's outgoing speech and look
1523.60s: what a great president he was you know
1524.84s: we we have the national highway system
1526.48s: because of the same man
1528.20s: who was pivotal to us winning World War
1530.52s: II and in his outgoing speech what did
1532.76s: he warn about he warned about the
1534.04s: situation we're in today we have we have
1536.40s: these wars are Undeclared by the way
1538.08s: like foret I know it's like probably
1539.76s: just a detail but the the Constitution
1541.76s: says that Congress declares war like
1544.04s: when when when when the Japanese
1546.60s: attacked PE Harbor you know FDR went to
1549.16s: Congress and asked for a declaration of
1550.68s: war now he got it and people were lining
1552.60s: up around the corners to to volunteer
1554.84s: for the Navy and for the Army and and so
1557.16s: on and and great that's all you know
1560.24s: aligned with the Constitution today the
1561.92s: president basically has the power to to
1565.68s: to to act in a way that amounts to
1567.72s: Undeclared Wars um and I I just don't
1570.12s: think that's the way the country was
1571.72s: founded and was meant to be we should be
1573.04s: debating these things our Congress men
1575.72s: and women and our Senators should be
1577.88s: putting their names to a vote do we want
1580.08s: to go to war with
1581.88s: Iran okay what are our objectives what
1584.88s: what is the outcome what's the
1585.76s: definition of victory I think of colen
1587.04s: Pow with
1588.20s: with the war in Iraq I mean what
1590.40s: whatever you think of Powell and you
1591.72s: know his subsequent speech in front of
1593.16s: the United Nations and all that in the
1595.04s: first Gulf War I mean it was very clear
1598.04s: this these were our missions now look we
1600.00s: didn't handle the victory very well but
1601.48s: at least from a military perspective it
1604.00s: was very clear what and we had a vote by
1605.80s: the way it was a controversial vote and
1607.60s: how people voted mattered um over time
1610.12s: now we just we've done away with all of
1612.16s: these formalities as though they were
1614.08s: irrelevant and this is a disturbing
1615.96s: Trend in our view if the president can
1617.80s: just randomly decide to uh embal the US
1620.68s: in various conflicts around the world
1622.32s: with basically minimal oversight from
1623.72s: Congress that's a very dangerous
1625.92s: situation leads me to another question I
1628.16s: have for you and again I know this is
1630.16s: this might be a little farther outside
1631.60s: of your typical preferred wheelhouse but
1633.84s: it is something I I just personally am
1636.00s: trying to understand better is this
1639.00s: increase in like the the use of
1641.60s: impeachment I was reading a couple
1643.48s: articles yesterday about you know people
1646.44s: attempting to start the impeachment
1648.76s: process for Biden obviously we did all
1650.40s: that for Trump do you have an opinion or
1653.28s: any thoughts on the increased use of
1655.92s: that as a political
1658.00s: tool sure um it's bad yeah they impeach
1662.76s: Trump twice once over Ukraine ironically
1665.20s: as you may recall like an afterthought
1667.20s: now seems like a lifetime away um I do
1670.80s: think this all of course goes back to
1672.84s: Clinton and his refusal to resign um and
1676.64s: and he stuck it out and he quote unquote
1678.08s: won but did the country lose um you know
1681.16s: there was a time when politicians who
1683.12s: were caught up in such scandals um
1684.96s: resigned and that was considered the
1686.64s: honorable thing to do and Clinton didn't
1689.12s: and um he fought impeachment and he won
1691.96s: and um unfortunately I think
1694.40s: the the weapon of impeachment has become
1697.64s: desensitized in the eyes of the voting
1700.48s: public and our hyperpolarization of our
1702.72s: politics means that whoever is doing the
1705.88s: impeaching is just viewed by the other
1707.72s: side as being um you know seeking Point
1712.32s: scoring against the other team so I
1715.04s: would argue there is no crime a
1716.68s: president could commit today that would
1718.72s: convince his his or her party that that
1722.16s: is worthy of impeachment because it's
1723.48s: just been
1724.52s: desensitized um the Democrats will land
1726.64s: up behind Biden no matter how much
1728.04s: evidence of corruption in Ukraine is on
1730.36s: Earth and um the Republicans will line
1733.72s: up behind whoever um might be their next
1736.52s: president um in a similar circumstance
1739.08s: and then we have
1740.72s: lost sadly we have lost the ability to
1745.80s: objectively um use tools like
1748.56s: impeachment for their intended purpose
1750.52s: which is to rid our politics of
1752.56s: corruption but our politics are so
1754.80s: corrupt that it's laughable and
1758.04s: impeachment is no different than the
1760.88s: knock out drag them out Wars over
1764.12s: Supreme Court appointing they just
1766.36s: another partisan
1767.96s: Battleground and and people will be
1770.20s: impeached for no good reason and people
1772.60s: who should be impeached and removed from
1774.00s: office Will Survive because the tool has
1776.12s: lot the knife is dull um it has been
1779.16s: improperly used and and has has
1782.00s: converted into yet another partisan you
1784.12s: know just like indistinguishable from
1786.00s: battles over redistri you know
1787.68s: redistricting of of Elections and so on
1789.84s: it it's just another tiresome team sport
1793.84s: um food
1795.56s: fight yeah it's kind of the answer I was
1800.40s: expecting you to say but I was hoping
1802.04s: that there was something I wasn't
1803.76s: considering um but
1806.40s: yeah sorry to let you
1808.76s: down I I sometimes I I do realize that I
1812.08s: look at some of this stuff with like
1813.36s: Rosy glasses hoping that there's just
1816.12s: something purposeful that I'm just not
1817.68s: seeing but yeah that sounds about right
1822.20s: um you mentioned before I want to skip
1824.96s: number two for a second which is Russia
1826.40s: Ukraine and I want to go right to number
1827.72s: three which is kind of us China and
1831.60s: Taiwan that relationship continues to be
1834.52s: fascinating to me obviously the US is
1836.84s: very interested in Taiwan for the
1838.24s: semiconductor business which they're
1839.68s: actually talking about and creating
1841.92s: incentives in infrastructure to start
1844.12s: localizing here in the US how do you
1846.52s: think that that impacts the relationship
1848.60s: with the US and China specifically as it
1850.60s: pertains to Taiwan I think it is
1852.88s: incredibly difficult to replicate what
1855.72s: Taiwan does in the semiconductor space I
1857.88s: think the secret sauce involved in
1860.72s: effectively runting a semiconductor
1863.24s: supply chain is vastly more difficult
1865.80s: than anybody over here even can begin to
1868.76s: understand I I've sold into that market
1870.48s: I understand it pretty well when I was
1872.52s: in Industry um the secret is in the
1875.56s: humans and and in the technicians and
1877.32s: that's just it's not like you can write
1878.92s: down a set of standard operating
1880.20s: procedures that you can copy and paste
1881.88s: and build a plant in Milwaukee and
1884.32s: suddenly you're up to speed and
1885.80s: competing with you know um with the
1887.68s: Taiwanese with respect to semiconductors
1889.60s: it it is
1891.32s: truly a point source of vulnerability
1894.44s: for the global economy that even China
1896.32s: itself who's spending tens if not
1897.84s: hundreds of billions of dollars trying
1899.04s: to replicate it can't quite Do It um and
1902.04s: so and in fact of course it's in
1904.16s: taiwan's interest to not really let
1905.80s: anyone else replicate it because if
1907.24s: everyone else could do it then there's
1908.56s: no you know no urgent need to defend
1911.80s: Taiwan against an incursion from China
1914.40s: um but I I would say the one thing that
1916.20s: I see missing from the discourse is just
1918.04s: how incredibly difficult it would be to
1919.96s: do this uh it and in fact I would argue
1923.32s: the vast majority of money allocated in
1925.48s: the US for this exercise will be totally
1928.92s: wasted wish I had a better answer for
1931.04s: you but do you think it's potential for
1934.96s: the semiconductor
1936.88s: industry to even be moderately effective
1939.56s: here in the US do you think that kind of
1941.28s: where Taiwan is so far ahead that it's
1943.76s: just a Fool's errand in total well you
1946.08s: know and Design we're very we're very
1948.64s: strong of course but China is trying to
1950.88s: catch up which is why we wrote this
1952.20s: piece about the arm IPO and Masa Sun's
1955.16s: dropping of bags on on Western investors
1958.00s: because basically armed China has been
1960.36s: confiscated by the Chinese government
1961.84s: even though it's Undeclared um and so
1964.92s: that you know closing the gap on design
1968.64s: is a lot easier you could steal that IP
1971.00s: um than it is on the fabrication side of
1974.08s: things and um that's where it is still
1977.08s: very much a magic and an art um it is
1980.36s: difficult for people they just assume
1981.80s: this is just another production process
1983.32s: that that can be copied and it just
1985.16s: isn't this just not how semiconductors
1986.76s: work and we're we've been researching a
1988.80s: piece on this for some time can't quite
1991.36s: figure out how to add a unique angle to
1993.16s: it that isn't already out there we might
1994.48s: just highlight this and and a few other
1996.44s: things that we know about the sector but
1998.36s: um it's very very difficult to replicate
1999.88s: what Taiwan has and if War does break
2001.92s: out and those facilities are damaged for
2003.76s: example you're going to see catastrophic
2005.20s: consequences for the global economy
2009.16s: what makes it so difficult because I
2011.44s: think about what the US can produce I
2014.88s: think about a lot of the just insanely
2018.00s: complex intricate items that we're able
2020.28s: to make now what
2022.84s: makes what Taiwan is doing so difficult
2025.80s: to replicate it's the yield you know
2028.16s: you're talking about nanometer level
2030.20s: features that you're you know etching
2032.76s: onto super pure silicon Wafers um and
2037.72s: there's just an Institutional knowledge
2039.68s: that is built up it's it's literally
2042.44s: Master mechanics wrenching on
2045.48s: complicated cars is the best analogy
2047.72s: that that you know there's just certain
2049.24s: people that know when you hear the tone
2051.80s: of a knock exactly what's going on and
2053.80s: where to wrench and it's it's that way
2057.08s: and of course a lot of this is kept
2059.12s: inhouse inside these companies as Trade
2061.40s: Secrets and they would never put it in a
2062.88s: patent because that's just something
2064.04s: that makes it easier for people to steal
2066.32s: and so um it it is just if you've ever
2070.48s: been to one of these you know um
2073.32s: the astronomical length that one has to
2077.08s: go in order to produce semiconductor
2081.60s: chips of some reasonable yield and
2083.32s: Purity with some economic you know uh
2087.80s: efficiency you're talking amongst the
2090.20s: most sophisticated industrial processes
2092.20s: that humankind runs and so it might be
2094.64s: feel impressive to go to a Factory that
2097.52s: makes very high Precision
2099.24s: screws right but this is a whole another
2101.88s: plane Eric and um and it just it just is
2105.00s: Decades of institutional knowledge um in
2108.12s: the hands and minds of a very small
2110.08s: number of people that has passed down
2112.32s: and apprentices and so on and and the
2115.16s: cultural barriers to Translating that
2117.68s: Knowledge from say a laboratory
2119.52s: technician in Taiwan which by the way
2121.24s: has a a whole different definition and
2123.92s: and sort of um societal pedigree than
2127.16s: technician might have even in
2128.48s: Switzerland or or in the US and so um
2131.72s: it's just very very challenging and so I
2133.36s: only point that out not say it's
2134.52s: impossible but to say the timelines that
2136.92s: our planners are anticipating that they
2138.76s: might be able to close that Gap I think
2141.08s: are are vastly optimistic and uh and
2144.16s: this is a known issue for anyone in and
2146.08s: around the industry for for the better
2147.52s: part of decades like it just is really
2149.48s: hard to do and that's why taian does it
2152.08s: so successfully is because this is their
2154.28s: part of the value chain that they have
2155.80s: mastered right yeah makes a ton of sense
2158.88s: it's funny because I I've done a bunch
2160.60s: of bunch of homework because I used to
2162.36s: invest a lot in things like uh Intel AMD
2166.12s: so on and so forth so I spent a lot of
2167.88s: time learning about just the world of
2170.32s: Chip making so I think the way that you
2172.44s: described it there though is really
2174.60s: understandable for people so thanks for
2175.84s: going into that that detail CU I think
2177.84s: that that is really important for people
2180.12s: to grasp especially as I look at the
2183.08s: relationships between us and China a lot
2184.92s: of people I hear will say something as
2187.44s: well why why don't we just make them
2188.80s: here right and I think you
2190.96s: very very eloquently summarized why that
2193.84s: is so difficult so I I think it's just a
2196.44s: good perspective to get out so on that
2199.68s: same thread
2200.45s: [Music]
2201.52s: though what does the relationship now
2204.80s: with the US and China look like going
2206.40s: forward I think much depends on the
2208.44s: upcoming potential you know meeting
2211.08s: between G and Biden if it happens in San
2212.88s: Francisco um mix signals in that regard
2216.84s: um we would hope that um there would be
2220.04s: a path for deescalation but we have we
2222.84s: have seeded control of Choke points in
2225.84s: our economy to China this is not a
2228.00s: secret to anybody um the
2230.00s: de-industrialization of the US um has
2232.28s: come at the expense of our capacity to
2234.20s: manufacture and and has benefited China
2236.92s: geopolitically we wrote a piece called
2238.36s: geopolitical Warfare where we talked
2240.00s: about how China allowing its domestic
2242.16s: manufacturers the right to pollute with
2244.28s: abandon has caused sort of a crowded out
2247.60s: of good manufacturers from the market
2249.16s: because if you're I would like to say if
2251.24s: your competitor's idea of a water
2252.80s: treatment plant is a pipe to the river
2254.24s: you have no hope of competing on cost
2257.00s: and and Western buyers of commodity
2259.44s: Goods don't really care about such
2260.80s: things even though they like to Proclaim
2262.84s: their environmental bonafides and they
2264.20s: have really fancy nice booths at cop 28
2267.52s: and they talk about how you know they
2268.92s: have these great sustainability programs
2270.68s: for 5 cents a pound they will they will
2272.48s: take all of your volume and give it to
2273.84s: the dirtiest producer in China and uh
2276.36s: they just just don't care I mean it's
2277.52s: all a facade it's all Bs and so China
2280.32s: has used this to their advantage and has
2282.04s: rolled up for example China processes
2284.84s: 100% of the world's rare earth metals so
2286.64s: even if we have a rare earth metal mine
2288.60s: in the US that material must be shipped
2290.40s: to China for processing before we can be
2292.00s: used in a magnet or an electric motor or
2294.52s: things like that um everywhere you look
2296.92s: China has essentially Monopoly control
2299.76s: in key chook points same thing with
2301.32s: solar um they own 97 plus% of the ignant
2305.00s: um forming and and wafering sell
2307.48s: mounting markets which means the three
2309.44s: remaining polyic PLS in the US have to
2311.00s: ship their material to China for further
2312.40s: process so we have given China control
2315.24s: over these key Monopoly choke points and
2317.76s: uh it's almost predominantly because
2320.44s: they allow their domestic producers to
2322.04s: pollute um and we don't because we care
2324.80s: about the environment and and our
2327.28s: proposal wasn't that we should allow our
2330.00s: domestic um producers to pollute our
2332.16s: proposal was that we should um offset
2334.44s: the cost of of installing World leading
2336.48s: pollution controls so that they can
2337.96s: compete on a Level Playing Field with
2339.72s: the Chinese manufacturers because the
2341.64s: ability to pollute amounts to an illegal
2344.12s: and Undeclared subsidy for their
2345.84s: domestic manufacturers and so China is
2347.76s: willing to degrade its environment in
2349.80s: order to gain geopolitical power against
2351.64s: us and they do so routinely and it's
2353.08s: high time we wake up to this fact and do
2355.32s: something about
2357.00s: it I agree and I see your perspective on
2360.64s: China improving its position what are
2362.60s: your thoughts though on the areas that
2364.72s: China is still ring on the US for the
2368.00s: reason why I ask is because I think when
2370.84s: I look at the relationship between the
2372.24s: US and China and the potential conflict
2374.00s: in Taiwan in my perspective I always
2376.72s: viewed it as a low probability event
2379.52s: because of still yet how intertwined the
2381.84s: US and China are reciprocally does that
2384.80s: impact or do you have any thoughts on
2386.40s: that specifically sure the number one
2388.52s: thing the Chinese Communist Party cares
2390.12s: about is feeding his people so obviously
2392.40s: a big vulnerability is food which is why
2394.48s: you see China making strategic Moves In
2396.48s: in the US egg sector and I think their
2399.44s: purchase of senta many years ago should
2401.32s: be viewed through that lens it was one
2402.60s: of our early pieces um almost
2404.92s: embarrassed to to S out a link to it
2407.40s: because you know we've gotten so much
2408.36s: better at writing these now but um you
2411.56s: know China cares very deeply
2414.32s: about making sure that everyone's plate
2417.04s: domestically is full and so um that is
2420.12s: the one major point source of weakness
2422.28s: there are others highend ships for
2423.64s: example which is why we the Biden
2425.32s: Administration has been trying to ban
2427.44s: their export to China and China has
2429.40s: reciprocated by Banning things like
2430.84s: graphite and there's some talk of rare
2432.80s: earth um export controls as well they
2435.80s: have cards to play we have cards to play
2437.72s: um I don't think anybody wins a race to
2439.20s: the
2440.04s: bottom I I I think you know ever
2442.76s: escalating envir uh economic Warfare
2445.92s: only leads to inevitable kinetic Warfare
2448.16s: which would be a catastrophe for both
2449.40s: countries so one would hope that the
2451.80s: concept of mutually assured destruction
2453.64s: both economically and militarily would
2456.16s: would would um allow for serer heads to
2459.40s: Prevail U but again when you talk about
2462.44s: bringing all of these three B potential
2465.16s: battles you know to the
2467.04s: same uh consideration if if the US and
2470.32s: Iran get into a hot war that puts China
2472.28s: very precarious situation from an energy
2473.96s: perspective and might motivate them to
2476.24s: escalate their conflict with Taiwan and
2478.44s: get it done while they still have oil in
2479.80s: their reserves or it might have Bolden
2481.60s: Putin to go even harder in Ukraine
2483.20s: because the US is distracted now and and
2485.04s: it's limited Military supplies are being
2486.68s: rerouted to the Middle East and what
2488.28s: does that mean for Poland and for NATO
2489.96s: and for Germany there's all manner of
2491.60s: dominoes that get pretty scary to
2493.52s: contemplate which is you know to Circle
2495.16s: all the way back like perhaps we should
2496.96s: Ponder these things before we you know
2499.40s: um our so bellicose with um with people
2501.88s: that we should frankly be treating us
2503.04s: peers and not
2505.36s: adversaries you brought up Russia
2508.52s: Ukraine earlier you brought up the idea
2511.76s: that you
2513.56s: felt we might have underestimated or the
2516.72s: US is kind of playing down the
2520.04s: progression of the conflict what makes
2521.60s: you say that and what's your perspective
2522.96s: on the
2524.08s: conflict so again not our primary area
2527.64s: of expertise but if we just compare I
2531.24s: just got to say it sounds like for the
2533.20s: podcast I've done a great job spending
2535.36s: the whole time talking about stuff
2537.52s: outside your area expertise I mean I'm
2540.32s: happy to talk about anything but I just
2541.76s: want to make sure the audience doesn't
2543.12s: assume that we have some you know some
2545.60s: something unique to add other than our
2547.20s: personal opinions and so very careful to
2548.80s: make sure that we again like if you want
2550.92s: to talk to me about the nuances of the
2552.40s: polyeth supply chain I'd be more than
2554.04s: comfortable saying yeah let me tell you
2555.24s: about it um our view is if you just
2557.72s: compare the propaganda of the springtime
2559.96s: quote unquote offensive to where we are
2562.00s: today and we see the disastrous trip
2564.36s: that zalinsky had in particular the
2566.16s: Fiasco and the Canadian Parliament which
2568.60s: probably not many of your listeners are
2570.52s: aware of but I think was a real public
2572.56s: affairs Fiasco for the war effort and
2575.60s: then um the fact that Putin's still
2578.16s: there our sanctions didn't work as much
2580.04s: as we predicted and we caught a lot of
2581.40s: flak for pointing out that these were
2583.04s: terribly designed sanctions that he
2584.36s: could easily circumvent and he has we
2586.52s: haven't destroyed the Russian economy
2588.12s: Putin is still you know wildly popular
2590.60s: within Russia um and and then just
2593.48s: saying these things of course gets you
2594.88s: in trouble over here which is another
2596.40s: sign like if we were so confident in our
2598.12s: position we wouldn't be trying to stamp
2600.28s: down people who might have a different
2602.48s: opinion than the consensus and I think
2604.44s: sininsky you know the he's been sacked
2606.40s: generals um recently and there seems to
2608.64s: be very little progress in the so-called
2610.40s: offensive and and and frankly um the war
2615.64s: in Israel and it is a war it's a
2618.12s: declared war really between Israel and
2620.04s: Hamas um is causing the US to redirect
2623.84s: its focus and its military supplies to
2627.00s: Israel and that has to come at the
2628.88s: expense of Ukraine it's not we have an
2630.96s: infinite supply of armor um and so um I
2635.16s: think time will tell and these aren't
2637.68s: things we're hoping for these are things
2639.44s: that we're pointing out as serious risks
2641.56s: um given the the situations that are
2643.44s: unfolding and and by the way like if we
2645.92s: can't Supply both Israel and Ukraine at
2647.96s: the same time what does that mean for
2649.12s: our ability to fight a war with Iran let
2650.64s: alone
2652.00s: China you know like I think one of the
2655.36s: reasons why you don't get into Wars is
2656.84s: you might lose
2659.32s: them like I don't know it seems like
2661.68s: very common sense to me like again and
2663.84s: and so um I just think
2667.68s: keep a close eye on Ukraine that that
2670.00s: would be my sense you know based on the
2672.96s: the people that we follow and and we try
2674.72s: to get both sides and we read the know
2677.52s: Pro Ukraine Western reports and we do
2680.04s: read you know and and listen to a few
2682.24s: pro- Russian stuff as well and I don't
2684.56s: think there's anything wrong with doing
2685.60s: that like you try to get a holistic View
2687.04s: and and come to your own opinion um our
2689.12s: view is there's a bit of panic uh on
2693.32s: zelinsky's team correctly so if we were
2695.28s: him we would be rather are concerned as
2696.56s: well um you may remember he tried to
2698.60s: invite himself to Israel and Israel
2699.96s: spurned him um I think Israel would
2702.16s: probably view Ukraine as a threat to
2703.68s: Israel security now because the
2705.12s: basically whoever gets the weapons wins
2707.16s: the wars and they would they would be um
2710.96s: viewing Ukraine as competing for limited
2712.84s: us resources um and there's a view in
2715.92s: the US that we could fund all of this
2717.24s: and that we could supply all of this and
2718.92s: and maybe we can I don't know we shall
2721.28s: see but I would view put it this way the
2723.80s: least happy person to see connect
2726.00s: conflict breakout in the Middle East
2727.40s: obviously besides the direct compat and
2729.00s: the the the victims and so on but from a
2731.56s: geopolitical perspective the the the
2733.00s: least happy person to see those events
2734.88s: unfold wasinski I just think that's
2737.20s: undeniable sure yeah I mean he obviously
2739.60s: sees his resources potential pull of
2741.68s: resources dwindling there I think I go
2744.32s: back and forth not that it my opinion
2746.24s: matters either but I think the the
2748.56s: progression of the conflict in Ukraine
2750.08s: has been fascinating to me from a just a
2752.76s: militaristic standpoint because I I it's
2756.24s: funny when you said that we over or
2760.96s: underestimated like the military might
2763.08s: of some of these other peers and I think
2765.76s: from a military militaristic standpoint
2767.84s: most of us look and we think we're the
2770.80s:  of the Russians like we we actually
2773.44s: are overwhelmingly underwhelmed with how
2777.04s: how they're performing and that's not to
2779.08s: say that Russia doesn't have the
2781.92s: capacity to really do a lot of damage in
2785.92s: my opinion they've been pulling a lot of
2787.68s: their punches because I in at least in
2790.96s: my ignorant assessment I don't think
2792.36s: Russia is trying to eviscerate Ukraine
2794.56s: yeah I think that conflict goes down to
2796.92s: a cultural level so they're not coming
2798.72s: in super heavy-handed but still we can
2800.68s: glean a lot from their tactics and a lot
2803.80s: of the stuff that we see from both sides
2806.88s: exactly to your point not just Pro us um
2810.24s: or Pro Western media you can see some of
2813.36s: the uh tactics techniques and procedures
2816.68s: that are deployed and it's amateurish at
2820.24s: best which I find very fascinating
2824.32s: um s go ahead no I was just gonna say
2826.88s: like these again well beyond you you
2828.72s: have far more expertise in this area
2830.24s: than I would um I wouldn't know a
2832.60s: sophisticated tactic from a borish one
2834.80s: um I just don't have the the knowledge I
2837.24s: would just say um I don't think either
2840.32s: side anticipated that we would be um
2843.32s: where we are some 20 months into the
2846.96s: conflict right I mean um I think there
2850.04s: were many who expected that Russia would
2851.48s: just steamroll perhaps some even within
2853.24s: Putin's inter circle and there were many
2855.00s: in the west that expected that our
2857.32s: sanctions would cause the Russian
2858.76s: economy to collapse and for regime
2860.24s: change to occur in Moscow and that
2862.20s: hasn't happened either and I think look
2864.76s: I
2865.56s: mean obviously punches are being pulled
2868.20s: because nobody no nukes have been
2869.40s: exchanged like the US has nuclear
2871.28s: weapons Russia has a very
2873.00s: formable um Suite of nuclear weapons as
2875.40s: well I do think that um that that by
2879.16s: definition um as bastardly as this war
2882.04s: has been and has and as U catastrophic
2886.56s: it has been for the citizens of of
2888.20s: Ukraine in particular it could be way
2890.92s: worse I mean we could be dropping
2892.88s: nuclear weapons on each other and we're
2894.48s: not thankfully let's hope that never
2895.88s: happens but yeah I mean I think nobody
2898.60s: had on their bingo card that 20 months
2901.00s: on we would be basically roughly where
2903.60s: we were when the war started
2906.32s: I think it goes back to a point you said
2908.32s: earlier that I do find tends to repeat
2911.00s: itself when we were talking about
2912.28s: semiconductors in the timeline that the
2914.96s: US laid out for domesticating some of
2918.00s: that I feel like in general people are
2920.48s: far too optimistic with their timelines
2922.68s: and I think we see this across multiple
2925.32s: facets but to your point I agree with
2927.36s: you because I think if you ask most
2929.28s: people when does this come to a
2932.12s: conclusion I mean the US it's like Fly
2935.20s: by Night right as soon as something has
2937.12s: been around for a little bit we're bored
2938.56s: and tired of it we need something new to
2940.08s: focus on I I I'm actually curious if you
2942.88s: ask most US citizens if the war in
2944.44s: Ukraine is still going on what they
2945.68s: would say so I'm I'm genuinely curious
2947.52s: the answer to that and I bet you none of
2949.20s: them could find cre on a map hey I mean
2952.20s: like it's not and again that's not to
2953.76s: insult the US public it's just it just
2955.48s: goes to show you how far away all this
2957.12s: is and look yeah if you're a citizen of
2959.04s: Ukraine it's outrageous what Putin has
2961.16s: done to you um and and you know the in
2965.76s: ter of events are catastrophic and again
2967.68s: like this is not what the outcome that
2970.44s: anybody's cheering for but as analysts
2972.76s: and realists you s try to figure out
2974.40s: what the answer is going to be and
2976.56s: position yourself accordingly but um
2978.36s: yeah there are no winners in a war I
2980.00s: mean who wins in a war I I don't know
2982.08s: like you think the Russian shoulders who
2983.92s: have died on the front of Ukraine
2985.76s: fighting people that look and talk like
2987.44s: them um are winners in this war of
2989.84s: course not and Ukraine is certainly not
2991.20s: winning the war um I don't think Putin
2993.28s: standing in the world has increased
2994.72s: because of the War I
2996.20s: I don't know I I I would I personally if
2998.28s: I were a leader on the geopolitical
3000.04s: stage which I'm not I would have a far
3002.88s: far higher bar to kinetic conflict um
3006.92s: especially if I was the most powerful
3008.28s: military in the world which the US is
3010.88s: you know right so that that would just
3012.96s: be
3013.76s: me yeah interesting we have about a
3017.56s: little less than 10 minutes left I want
3019.16s: to Pivot us a little bit more now to
3021.00s: kind of future Focus coming to the end
3023.52s: of 2023 we're kicking off 2024 are those
3027.36s: primary focus areas that you outlined in
3029.20s: the beginning your primary focus areas
3030.88s: going forward or are there other things
3033.00s: that you guys are integrating into your
3035.68s: sphere of Interest as we enter 2024 yeah
3039.60s: only to the extent that those three
3041.20s: things influence the energy markets um
3043.80s: obviously you know energy is our bread
3045.40s: and butter it's where we were born and
3047.60s: raised and it's it's what we write most
3049.84s: about um and so our view is um
3053.12s: predominantly focused on second and
3054.80s: third order impact imps of those events
3056.96s: which is the only real motivating reason
3058.56s: for us to try and even get a superficial
3061.08s: understanding of them and the potential
3062.72s: scenarios um but our our big Focus right
3066.60s: now is is we think we've reached Peak
3069.88s: ESG we think um the world is is
3073.20s: embarking on a nuclear
3075.36s: Renaissance that road won't be without
3077.28s: its bumps and we saw one this week with
3078.80s: new scale and smrs and you know so on um
3082.68s: but by and large um physics is beginning
3084.72s: to reassert
3086.00s: self and we we recently wrote a piece
3088.64s: about how this um computing power race
3091.32s: which is of course tied up with China
3092.68s: and semiconductors and and data centers
3095.20s: and so on might be the conduit through
3097.72s: which nuclear energy is normalized again
3099.72s: in the western world not that it it ever
3102.00s: should have needed
3103.12s: renormalization but um you know we we
3106.24s: talked about um how uh you know in a
3109.20s: piece called fision chips which is one
3110.60s: of our favorite titles how artificial
3112.44s: intelligence could in fact disrupt the
3113.76s: energy markets and so our objective is
3116.00s: to um process the news headlines of the
3120.76s: day through the lens of energy for our
3124.80s: subscribers and we always remind
3127.12s: ourselves like nobody goes to the
3128.60s: Weather Channel or um geopolitical
3132.12s: pontifications about um obscure Wars um
3136.80s: and and people come to Doomer for energy
3138.56s: and we and we want to Delight our
3140.48s: subscribers and so we we do try to focus
3143.24s: our thoughts and and research on how um
3146.00s: these second and third order
3147.48s: consequences might might might find
3149.16s: their way back into the energy
3151.36s: market right and then I always think
3153.84s: it's fascinating too how well markets
3155.96s: specifically Commodities markets can
3157.64s: help us understand just these esoteric
3162.64s: ambiguous problems because to your point
3165.80s: you can glean a lot of information and
3167.80s: you said in the beginning that you felt
3169.16s: the Commodities markets might be
3171.68s: underplaying the potential risk what
3173.84s: makes you think that that's just think
3175.84s: if you look at the price action well
3177.44s: okay there's two interpretations the
3179.16s: price action in oil is telling you that
3180.84s: war is not going to spread in the Middle
3182.20s: East or the price action in oil is
3185.36s: underestimating the spreading of war in
3186.84s: the Middle East right and and so um
3190.48s: those who believe that the market is um
3193.52s: is able to foresee such things would
3196.28s: say the situation in Israel is
3199.24s: contained it's cast you know as
3201.32s: catastrophic as it is for the people
3202.72s: involved it's highly unlikely that it's
3204.92s: going to spread to Iran the Chinese will
3207.08s: keep Iran at Bay and the US will come to
3209.96s: its censes and realize it has limited
3211.48s: armaments and will'll put on a Big Show
3213.36s: and we have a bunch of aircraft carriers
3215.20s: you know over there now which is one of
3216.80s: the greatest Assemblies of of military
3219.68s: um Force since the last golf War which
3222.80s: I'm sure you know and you're following
3224.68s: and so sometimes when they show up they
3226.52s: you know battles just happen to break
3227.80s: out because of there but we shall see um
3230.04s: but the market is telling us that war is
3231.56s: not going to spread I don't I don't know
3233.84s: if you disagree but oil is down maturely
3235.72s: from where it was the day before October
3238.36s: 7th and so if there was truly a kinetic
3241.80s: conflict between the US and Iran on the
3243.32s: horizon I don't think we'd see WTI in
3246.20s: the in the high 70s I I just don't see
3248.64s: it right and have you do you guys have
3251.96s: any um works that you've done studying
3255.08s: the predictive capacity of something
3257.32s: like oil against those kinds of
3259.96s: conflicts to see how yeah how predictive
3263.12s: it is I mean it failed in the in the
3266.04s: Russia Ukraine war but at the same time
3268.40s: you know I I haven't validated this I've
3270.24s: read it in multiple situations but
3272.20s: apparently the US Stock Market bottomed
3274.80s: out on the day of the Battle of
3277.24s: Midway now I again I've read that from
3280.80s: enough respectable people but I have not
3282.92s: independently gone and validated that
3285.16s: but nobody knew what happened in Midway
3287.00s: for weeks after the the battle right and
3289.64s: but the market sniffed it out so that's
3291.72s: held up as the example of of the market
3293.44s: being all knowing um I would argue that
3296.08s: you know the energy Market's performance
3297.72s: in the 10 days before Russia rolled into
3300.92s: Ukraine um was not predictive and so I
3305.00s: guess we'll just have to see how it does
3307.00s: here got it I gotta say it's always an
3311.48s: absolute pleasure to to talk with you
3313.56s: guys and I know that for this one I kind
3315.28s: of kept you outside your typical sphere
3318.12s: of uh specialty but there's a couple
3322.00s: reasons why I like to do that to be
3323.32s: honest because you guys produce a lot of
3325.12s: content in that space already yeah so a
3327.88s: lot of what I like to do is explore some
3330.12s: of these offshoot threads because I do
3332.84s: think very similarly to your perspective
3335.32s: in that you can use markets you can use
3337.32s: Commodities to then infert information
3340.28s: and it's really cool to hear what
3341.84s: conclusions we arrive at looking at
3344.20s: events through those lenses so thank you
3346.28s: for spending you know 40 minutes plus
3348.36s: walking us through some of those dots
3351.40s: that you connect in the way that you see
3353.04s: the world awesome yeah I really
3354.32s: appreciate it and really enjoyed it and
3355.96s: get looking forward to a third
3357.00s: appearance yeah absolutely and then I'll
3359.16s: throw a link in the notes below with all
3361.28s: of your guys' contact information for
3362.80s: people to reach out to you as they would
3364.88s: like but thanks for hanging out on the
3366.56s: podcast and we will talk to you again
3370.72s: soon
