0.00s: Hey everybody, Eric here. I got Dave again and I figure what better timing with everything
8.16s: that we're seeing going on in the marketplace to kind of talk to the man that's pretty plugged
12.40s: in and you know, learn a little bit more what you're seeing in the landscape. So first off,
17.92s: welcome back great to have you again. I'm glad, you know, last time didn't scare you away.
21.76s: Yeah, thanks for having me. I really appreciate it and you know, appreciate you and your
27.28s: audience and the interest of what we're doing. So happy to talk about it.
30.64s: Tweet, yeah. So we have kind of a cool agenda today. I gave you, you know, just like a brief run
35.60s: through some of the things that I wanted to cover. But, you know, to start off, last time we spoke
40.88s: a lot about fiscal policy, you know, what the Fed involvement in the market has looked like. And
46.80s: essentially how we've essentially gone off the playbook. We're starting to do a lot of things
52.32s: that well, we, you know, the Fed is starting to do a lot of things that we just hadn't really
58.24s: seen before and we're not exactly sure where it leads us. So I thought what better way to pick up
64.88s: than, you know, resuming that conversation because we're starting to see some of the Fed's thoughts,
70.32s: the minutes are coming out or was it today or tomorrow that they come out from last month?
74.80s: Yeah, yeah, the minutes are coming out soon. We have a pretty big meeting scheduled what for
81.44s: next month, mid March, where we're expecting a rate raise and all those kinds of things. So
85.76s: I'd love to just start there and get your general thoughts on the current state of the marketplace
92.40s: as a whole and then even just maybe a little broader what the economic picture looks like to you.
97.60s: We don't have to stay in one bucket or the other just whatever comes to your mind.
101.20s: Sure, you know, I got to remember this for next time. I got this great t-shirt and it says,
106.40s: I survived the Fed rate hike of 2015 because at the time, it felt like it was a pretty big deal
112.64s: and it shows you like rates going down and then down and then like at the bottom,
116.40s: there's just like this little, right up, you know, when they hiked in 2015 and obviously,
121.12s: you know, they ended up undoing that. So it's funny because the last time we spoke, I remember
130.56s: this was what we end on as you're saying and I told you our team transitory
135.68s: and I remain, I will say, I remain team transitory and I sort of defer to economists who know a whole lot
144.64s: more about this than I do. I do have a background in economics but I'm not immersed in it on a day-to-day basis.
153.04s: So I mostly, you know, I kind of separate in terms of my knowledge,
157.92s: I separate the things that I study on a regular basis from, you know, the things other people study
164.48s: and I learned from on a regular basis and economics is probably in that second bucket. But,
171.28s: you know, I think when you sort of look at the inflation numbers, the argument against it being
179.28s: transitory is that it's not really being calculated correctly and that it is much worse than the
185.36s: number is, you know, the headline number of 7.5% makes it out to be and I think Phil Ackman,
191.44s: you know, has tried to make that particular case and saying that rental and I think rental prices
197.44s: are not being accounted for correctly and he had some other points on that. And then when you look
202.88s: at it from the sort of transitory perspective, when you pull a, first of all sort of assuming CPI
209.76s: is being calculated correctly and representative of what of the price pressures that people are
215.44s: facing, then like when you pull out used cars, it drops dramatically and so, you know,
222.64s: the right not buying a used car, your CPI is probably pretty significantly different. And now,
228.96s: you know, yeah, we're facing the highest rate of food inflation that we've seen in a long time.
233.52s: But then again, we saw, you know, those numbers drop a lot as the sort of pandemic set in and such.
240.40s: So again, I think we're going to start to see inflation slow down significantly. I think this
246.80s: was probably the highest print. That's what the people who I respect the most in economics are saying.
253.76s: And I think that's probably what the Fed thinks. I would say that there's an economist Claudius Am,
262.16s: who I find to have great analysis. She worked at the Fed for a long time. She's very active on Twitter
268.40s: and I find her analysis to be some of the more compelling analysis out there. So, you know, I'm kind of just
276.08s: talking about a lot of the things that she's been talking about. But you know, from her perspective,
281.68s: she thinks that the Fed is looking at all this very closely, that they're not going to overreact.
286.72s: A lot of people are saying, let's have an emergency meeting next week. Let's get a rate hike fast.
292.56s: I will say that I find it surprising that they're not stopping asset purchases. Right?
299.20s: There's another 20 billion for this month and they haven't signaled that they're stopping that.
304.08s: If I was, you know, in their shoes, which I'm obviously not, I would have assumed by now that would have
312.08s: ended maybe before they had indicated it would end at the very least. Because yeah, I agree that
318.48s: there's a rate hike coming. That should be no surprise. Everyone seems to agree on that. There's a big
322.96s: question on how much and how many. She thinks it's 25 basis points. You know, some people think 50 will
328.72s: be the first one. I don't know what the answer is. I don't know how markets are going to react.
334.72s: Because you're right. This is unprecedented. We are in an unprecedented situation and unprecedented
340.40s: conditions. Markets are getting a bit more volatile teams. We're seeing some, you know, they're kind
347.68s: of see-song now. We're seeing tech names really sell off when they have bad news.
355.92s: So, you know, all that is indicative to me that we're potentially going through sort of a
362.08s: regime change in markets, right? It's sort of the bad news, good news or as bad news, bad news.
367.36s: And we're starting to become the bad news. Now bad news get. And that's a big difference
373.12s: that you see generally more in a bear market than a bull market. But, you know, I've been
379.92s: wrong about that before for sure. So, you know, I think people that are forecasting right now,
387.60s: I find it hard to trust almost anyone. I don't think anyone really knows what's going to happen
392.96s: over what's going to unfold as the Fed tries to, you know, end asset purchases and emerge from
400.72s: zero-industry policy. It's going to be fascinating. That's for sure.
407.44s: Yeah, I'm still riveting. It's just seeing what happens here. It's just a riveting story.
413.12s: And it's like we were talking about last time, right? Like we really have no idea how this ends,
417.52s: how the market reacts. I mean, I've been blown away with how the markets looked right now in light of,
423.84s: you know, kind of the Fed tightening discussions. There's the whole Ukraine, Russia thing going on.
429.84s: And the market is like surprisingly not dropping. You know, it's very interesting to me how
442.00s: anytime you think you might be able to identify how the market might react to things. And then it just
448.40s: market just closed. And it's up a little bit. See, like that, I just don't get that.
453.20s: Right. And I mean, you know, this is like 24 hours where almost all the talk has been about a
458.24s: potential war that's starting. Yep. And the kind of sanctions that would be levied on Russia
464.24s: in the midst of that, you know, I am watching oil pretty closely. Yeah, it's near, it's near highs.
471.12s: Near like, yeah, what, three or five year highs. Right. And that's going to be driving, you know,
476.16s: that does help to drive inflation. But it also, you know, has a big, a pretty big impact, you know,
481.52s: economic, a broad economic impact. And, you know, if Russia does invade and the US levies
487.52s: and tens sanctions and so does the world and the price of oil really spikes, you know, that might
492.80s: be the thing that kind of cuts the market off at the knees. Yeah. I think something I've been
499.68s: considering a lot too is if things with Russia, you know, well, they started pulling back some
506.32s: of troops off the border. So a lot of people thought that was kind of a, you know, a dovish sentiment
511.52s: that they might be trying to reconcile peacefully. I think that was kind of part of what we saw in the
515.52s: market yesterday. But what I find to be even more interesting is as NATO is starting to kind of
523.04s: do the rallying call and get everybody aligned, I think it puts China in a fascinating position.
530.80s: And to me, that's really something that would just absolutely drop the hammer on just the economy
537.36s: in general right now is if China started to side more with Russia, if Russia was making
542.64s: its movements, you know, just in opposition essentially the Western powers and what not, obviously
547.44s: all conjecture, nobody knows. But I do think, you know, we see China's name starting to get involved.
553.44s: I can't think of many places where our economies are more intimately intertwined. And, you know,
560.08s: relationships with them starts deteriorating further. I can only imagine what that looks like.
565.92s: I mean, and you know, I think it's like this, it is a situation at the very least of kind of
571.68s: mutually assured destruction, right? Like China holds so many, so much of our debt that, you know,
578.08s: a problem for us, a certainly a problem for them. And it might be the only thing that it keeps
584.00s: things sane because I think you're right that China is the thing to watch. And it's the thing that
591.68s: I think everyone around the world is trying to separate from. And that's, you know, practically
599.84s: impossible. I think there are, you know, sort of the greatest geopolitical rival that we face.
607.04s: And, you know, certainly economic rival. And it's only going to get worse. So, you know, I think from
614.72s: from that perspective, they've got a lot of levers that they could pull that would be extremely bad
621.60s: for us. But, like I said, in doing that, they would be cutting off the nose despite the face,
626.64s: because, you know, they've got just as many entanglements into our economy as we have into theirs.
632.48s: Yeah, that's, and yeah, that's, it's just another one of those, the further you look at it,
637.12s: because I mean, obviously from like the geopolitical power side of things, there's one perspective.
643.68s: But then once you start understanding how the economies are so, so intertwined and dependent on
650.48s: one another, because a lot of people I think in the US, understandably, we see, you know, a lot of
655.28s: things made in China around the house. And a lot of people kind of just assume that that means China,
660.48s: it has a just overall dominant economy that's overwhelmed the US. I think obviously there's more
666.96s: to that story, especially once you start looking further at GDP and the kind of products that are
671.44s: moving in the level of technology that's being sold externally and things like that, that, you know,
677.20s: there's a disparity there that I don't think is as commonly known, but I just feel like the
683.44s: relationship between the two countries is just that if one starts doing any sort of significant
691.60s: sanctions opposed to the other, I just see it going downhill very fast right after that.
697.04s: I think so too. And, you know, I think it's a, it's a huge priority in the US to decouple from
701.52s: China. And I think that that should be something that the people pay way more attention to and that
706.64s: we pour way more resources into. I think one of our greatest sort of political failings is not
712.00s: making that one of the top issues in the country. And so, you know, I think if we could,
718.64s: from sort of a supply chain perspective and a manufacturing perspective decouple far more so
724.88s: from China, we would be in a much greater position because it would be worse for them as significant
731.12s: holders of our debt. Right. And it would be for us. Yep. If anything, go down. That's a really good point.
738.72s: So, there was a couple things that you brought up earlier that I wanted to make sure I circled back
743.04s: to one of which was some of your economic, your favorite economic sources of information on Twitter.
748.96s: I would be remiss if I didn't get a list of some of those people. I know that you already mentioned
752.56s: Claudia. Do you have anybody else that you would recommend, you know, if people just want to follow
759.44s: broader scale economics a little closer, anybody else that you'd recommend?
763.52s: You know, it's funny. Yeah, I follow people from sort of all across the spectrum.
771.44s: You know, I wouldn't necessarily endorse a lot of them, Chris. Sure. But I really find that getting
781.84s: other perspectives is worthwhile. You know, like Matt Stoller as an example, who is someone who
790.00s: really focuses on monopoly and corporate concentration. I find a lot of his analysis to be
796.48s: absolutely fascinating, extremely in depth and well supported. If you're not a liberal, you might
804.08s: not like him. He's very left. The same thing is someone called Noah Smith, who, you know, is very
813.04s: liberal. But I find him to be pretty measured when it comes to economic analysis.
821.04s: So, you know, I think off the top of my head, you know, that's most of what I tend to see
830.32s: in my stream. You know, there's Rohan Gray is another, another pretty good one who's, he's very
837.28s: much focused more on sort of, you know, like tech and digital currency issues. But you know, a lot
847.20s: of these, a lot of these people are, what I really like is when I read some of these analysis of
853.04s: modern monetary theory. And even in that left leaning group, you get sort of a very diverse set
862.40s: of perspectives and opinions on modern monetary theory, which is essentially like what we've
870.40s: been trying as a response to the pandemic. And for many of them, you know, they, they, I mean,
877.76s: you get, you get both perspectives, but Claudia, I think, for example, would consider this to be a
883.28s: triumph of modern monetary theory. And, you know, a demonstration that you can really kind of print
889.84s: your way out of a crisis without huge repercussions. And, you know, people might say, well, what about
896.96s: the inflation? But, you know, the, the, the inflation that we're seeing, again, if it ends up being
903.12s: transitory, is sort of an expected outcome of a, you know, it's sort of like a, it's more of a
912.40s: supply chain issue than a monetary policy. Quick, quick question on that. Sorry. Just, just for
921.20s: the, the transitory component, I am curious because, but like last time we talked about it, I was
926.72s: doing actually a bunch of research to try to get some ideas in terms of like what transitory
932.08s: inflation actually looks like. And I feel like that's just another area where people like me might
940.08s: have a really skewed perspective without looking at like a broader picture, right? Because I've been,
946.56s: like I said, I've been trading since like 2007. So my exposure to inflation is relatively small,
954.32s: right? Compared to just longer market durations and whatnot. So I would be really curious just to
960.16s: understand when you think of transitory inflation, like what are some of the defining features of
966.96s: that for you as you have a conversation about it, except I feel like a lot of people look at
971.44s: inflation right now and they're like, well, it's not transitory. It's been here for two months.
974.64s: You know what I mean? Like they kind of think it's been here for a few months. Sorry,
977.12s: it's three quarters, right? Right. You know, yeah, you know, I think that the way that it's been
983.60s: described to me is that it's a question of is it supply side inflation? Is it being driven by
991.36s: supply side or demand side? If it's driven by demand side, it's potentially more structural because
999.20s: that means it's being fed by, let's say, wage inflation and inflation expectations. Whereas if it's
1008.64s: being driven by the supply side, it's because suddenly, like we're seeing supply chains have become
1014.80s: constricted and tight and materials are hard to get. And so what happens is that then yes,
1021.04s: prices rise, but actions are taken because of those higher prices to streamline and improve the
1029.28s: supply side. And so it comes back to normal. So I think the way Claudia put it was, it's like an
1034.80s: inflation impulse, right? It's like, it's an impulse that hits and it can be over a couple of
1040.40s: quarters, right? It's not the kind of like when you say transitory, it doesn't mean like it's
1045.12s: going to be a one month reading of high inflation and then gone, right? It's going to be a curve
1050.64s: that goes up and then comes back down. And so that's, you know, what we would expect over the next
1055.76s: few months is that, you know, hopefully we're at the peak and we start to see at least level off
1062.24s: and then start to come back down. And so then we would look back at a couple of years and we would
1066.32s: say, oh, yeah, inflation was elevated for two or three quarters. And that and or even a year,
1074.40s: let's say, because the supply chains were completely, you know, screwed up. And like, you know,
1082.64s: given what's happened with COVID and the, you know, people not being able to go to work and then,
1089.76s: you know, the the weird sort of hoarding behaviors that we saw, we, you know, we really put our
1095.84s: our supply chains under this intense level of stress that I don't think anyone had ever sort of
1104.32s: contemplated before, you know, and now, yeah, we all have like a lifetime supply of toilet paper
1110.80s: and paper towels. You know, we can't get ships to dock in the imports of LA, fast enough, right? So
1118.80s: all this stuff is is a very weird situation that we find ourselves in, but you know,
1124.16s: it's transitory. It means things are going to normalize again, right?
1127.68s: I so it's so two things. The first one is I you are like the perfect match for like the stereotypical
1134.72s: nice Canadian people because the way you phrased the awkward hoarding behavior, to me, I'm thinking
1142.00s: just how psychotic human beings can be and completely nonsensical because it's like, I don't know,
1148.00s: like I get it toilet paper is nice. I get it. But I guess for a lot of people, they don't realize like
1153.12s: a good portion of the world goes without it. And I was worried about it's going to be like water.
1163.12s: That's just, you know, the typical American, they're like, well, I'll worry about food later. Let me get
1168.48s: this toilet paper. But the other thing that I'm actually really glad and I appreciate that
1175.28s: explanation because that really falls in line with a lot of what I was reading more in more or less
1181.76s: in terms of inflation being transitory is not directly tied to duration. And I think that a lot of
1188.64s: people immediately feel if it's, you know, here for experience of time, especially people like
1195.44s: me write millennials and it's even worse for younger people where our attention span is like 14
1200.32s: seconds. So if something's been here for a day, it's essentially there for eternity, you know.
1206.32s: And yeah, that's a really good point. And you know, I think a good, maybe a good example,
1215.28s: and this is off the top of my head. So it might not, you know, I'd probably have to look deeper into
1218.88s: this. But if you think of sort of the stagflationary period of the 70s and early 80s,
1225.60s: that's an excellent example of non-transitory inflation. So OPEC comes together to collude with
1234.08s: about on oil prices and keep them elevated for an extended period of time and not to reflect
1239.76s: supply demand equilibrium as well as economic growth slowing down. And, you know, suddenly,
1247.44s: you had consistent, extremely high inflation that, you know, there are certainly multiple narratives
1254.16s: about how it was dealt with. But one of those narratives is that vulgar, you know, spiked interest rates
1260.32s: essentially torpedoed the economy, but got inflation under control. I think there are other
1267.92s: sort of revisionist history theories as to what might have been more effective. And so I don't
1273.12s: want to speak to that or endorse a view of it. I'm only bringing it up to say that that's sort of
1278.40s: the example of inflation that you would not consider transitory and in which action and significant
1284.80s: action was needed in order to address it. And so, you know, I don't think that's the case today.
1291.76s: I think you already see Congress tightening from a fiscal policy perspective. Right? Inflation
1298.88s: can be driven by monetary policy, fiscal policy or, you know, supply demand conditions. And,
1305.36s: you know, if Congress is not going to pass like universal basic income or another massive social
1311.04s: spending program, you know, that's going to be a fiscal force for tightening. And you've got
1319.92s: the Fed as a monetary source, which will be tightening. And so it's, you know, to me, I think
1326.48s: it's good that we can hope hopefully that the Fed will not overreact and that will ease into this
1332.40s: tightening cycle. And, you know, if Powell can pull it off, it'll be really just an amazing success
1338.40s: story of a massive disruption and dislocation to our economy and our world. And one in which, you know,
1346.16s: the Fed responded, managed through it over, you know, frankly over multiple decades of crisis
1352.88s: after crisis. And maybe we're about to come out of it. What do you say or what's your opinion,
1359.44s: I should say, on all of the Bitcoin fanatics that say all of this government manipulation is
1369.60s: cured by Bitcoin. What do you think about that?
1378.88s: I'm not. So the reason I am not a retired Bitcoin multi-millionaire is because I don't believe
1388.08s: that. You know, I own a whole lot of Bitcoin as early as one. Oh, that's right. We talked about that.
1397.60s: You had both made the same mistake, man. Yeah. I bought it at $2. But I was never a true believer.
1404.96s: I was a trader and I traded out of it. And I have friends that were true believers. And, you know,
1410.16s: they can do whatever they want now because they're filthy rich. So, but most of those people,
1414.96s: they'll just keep holding it anyways. You know, somebody will never I got
1418.96s: converted to fiat. Yeah, I got 15 million in there, but it's going to keep going.
1424.32s: That's right. They will never pay taxes on that. You could kill them before they're going to pay
1429.20s: tax to the government. So, you know, I'm not a Bitcoin maximalist. I'm not a libertarian. I
1436.88s: love crypto. I think it's amazing technology. I think that it's got a place in our economy and our
1443.20s: market. But it does Bitcoin fix this so far not so far. It has not been proven to be an effective
1454.72s: inflation hedge. So, you know, it's sort of like we're at the point where the proofs in the
1461.92s: pudding, right? Like if it is going to fix this and address it, it should be doing that. It should
1467.28s: be going up as inflation goes up, which it hasn't because it's just it's a very volatile sort of
1473.04s: devil asset class. And, you know, I don't know, maybe 10, 20 years from now, it'll be more stable
1480.40s: and it will respond in the way they expect. But I think that's pure conjecture.
1484.80s: I think so too. The other thing that I think about is if the idea of Bitcoin is that it's like
1489.84s: universal currency, right? It's border or borderless. Inflation changes in different countries
1496.16s: at different points in time. So, like, what happens with that? So, yeah, I largely agree that there
1504.32s: is a place for Bitcoin. I think it's just a really, really fast. I have Bitcoin right now. Like,
1508.96s: I'm just I'm fascinated by it. I think that it has potential in certain ways. But I've always been
1513.84s: skeptical by, you know, the really, really Bitcoin evangelists that are essentially saying, you know,
1521.36s: if you have cancer, go get Bitcoin and now you're good. You know, it's just, yeah. I'm a good friend
1528.48s: who is one of those and, you know, more power to him. He's done pretty well thanks to it. But
1536.16s: just home to sell. And I think there's always I like the saying, you know, don't ever confuse
1544.40s: luck with skill. Yeah. And, you know, I think that we'll see. And I do think that Bitcoin will
1550.88s: can will be an excellent investment over the long haul. And I've got some substantial exposure
1558.32s: to different cryptos. And, you know, some real strong thoughts on where my money is going,
1565.44s: which is, you know, I'm not putting new money into Bitcoin. I put it mostly into Avalanche. I
1570.32s: think Avalanche is a far better technology. And, you know, I tend to approach things from a tech
1577.28s: perspective more than sort of a, you know, monetary structure person.
1584.96s: Probably one. Actually, I don't even know if anyone knows what this EFF shirt is, but they are
1592.08s: a non-profit that is standing up for you and your rights to digital online security and privacy.
1598.72s: They're safeguarding. Oh, that's a good technology is from government interference. And they are
1604.08s: a non-profit that I'm a strong supporter of. And us nerds have to band together and hold the line.
1609.52s: Speaking of nerds doing the right thing, did you see the news about Google? They're starting to
1615.28s: potentially re. I didn't read the article away through. So I'm probably coming off as 95% ignorant,
1622.00s: you know, 5% surplus than my usual. But I am, it was talking about essentially some user rights
1630.16s: adjustments to their current policies. Again, it's very broad, but they were comparing it to kind of
1635.76s: like what Facebook did with, I'm sorry, what Apple did with some of, you know, like the privacy
1640.48s: standards within the marketplace, you know, for like their app store and whatnot. Have you seen
1644.72s: any of that yet? It was literally today. So you might not have. I did not see it today. This is
1649.12s: a perfect segment and talking about the algorithmic accountability act. I would not trust Google.
1656.88s: There it is. Okay, there you go. Yeah. So for just a couple of minutes, I wanted to pull up some
1665.68s: tweets that Dave made mostly because I like looking at his profile picture. It's very dapper,
1670.72s: I must say, um, much younger Dave. Yeah. But one of the, you should see any of like my professional
1679.12s: photos. It's when I was still clean shaven. I don't have a beard in any of them. So I am like the
1683.92s: ultimate professional catfish because as soon as somebody sees me after they look at my LinkedIn
1689.52s: phone, they're like, who the hell is this guy? But anyways, this actually was one of the things I
1695.20s: really wanted to talk to you about was the algorithmic accountability act, which I was saying,
1699.44s: I never heard about that before you kind of like that sweatshirt you're wearing, which I'm
1702.72s: gonna check them out afterwards. You're always full of fun things to check out. So anyways, you know,
1707.28s: I'd love to hear just a little bit more about what you find interesting about the algorithmic
1712.16s: accountability act. Yeah, so for the last couple of years, I've been involved in the AI space.
1720.00s: And I actually, I sit on the editorial board for the Journal of AI and Ethics and
1725.76s: you know, the ethical use of AI is something I care very deeply about and the misuse of personal
1733.12s: data is also something that I care very deeply about. And it's why everybody who is listening to
1739.04s: this should delete their Facebook account right now. What Facebook has done is horrific. They've
1745.76s: destroyed civil society all in the name of it. And they've set us against each other. And I think
1754.08s: that they have no ethics for morals whatsoever. I got it. I'm sorry. I got to ask though,
1759.68s: what are like some of the things you're referring to like bundled into that statement?
1765.20s: Okay. So I wrote a piece on this. Good. In the Journal, it was an editorial. And in it, you know,
1774.96s: I explained that, you know, the Facebook claims to be about building community and bringing people
1781.20s: closer together. But what they really do is they have algorithms that separate us into filter
1786.16s: bubbles. And so they control the information that we see. And these algorithms are engineered
1792.08s: to maximize engagement and to maximize engagement, you need to make people angry and outraged. And
1798.56s: that is the core of this outrage machine. And that is the entire business model of Facebook.
1805.68s: I had an interaction with Facebook's chief AI scientist. Oh, pretty much just exactly a year ago
1812.80s: on Twitter. And he said that I had no idea what I was talking about. And that Facebook's AI
1818.48s: solves hate speech that it solves, calls violence and bullying. And it is able to effectively filter
1825.52s: out disinformation that invangers public safety or the integrity of the democratic process. So I'll
1831.68s: wait while everybody stops laughing. Yeah. Just takes it sounds right up the rally. It sounds like
1837.76s: it's a liar. What an absurd thing to claim that you're AI can do. And so instead of responding to
1846.88s: him on Twitter, I wrote this really extensive piece in the Journal of AI and Ethics with a really
1853.28s: extensive amount of information and study to show how bad their algorithms are, how they do
1859.60s: cost polarization and echo chambers and to show that they're, it is part of their business. Their
1867.52s: business is to get us angry and to make us hate each other. It makes sense too because if you think
1873.36s: about, oh, I'm sorry. I mean, it just like it popped in my mind like most of these, you know,
1878.56s: TV shows on Netflix and stuff, a lot of them are driven just by drama. Like people love drama. So
1884.64s: it does not surprise me in any way, you know, what you're saying that a social media platform is
1890.24s: applying a similar construct. Yes, that's right. Exactly. And, you know, they have supported genocide.
1897.60s: They have supported governments acting against their own citizens. They have, they have
1905.12s: made cyber bullying worse and they have made us all dumber and they have made it so that the
1911.76s: information we believe is completely divorced from reality. And so the Algarismic Accountability
1919.12s: Act is an attempt to start to put some guardrails on algorithms that impact people significantly.
1927.12s: And that would apply to Facebook, that would apply to Google search engines that would apply to
1931.68s: Twitter recommendation algorithms, any of these systems that are algorithmically controlling what
1939.36s: we see and recommending what we look at would need to have at the very least, you know, impact
1945.84s: assessments being done to understand what both what the impact of those algorithms are and what
1952.56s: changes to those algorithms would entail. And, you know, it's just like the barest minimum of
1957.92s: accountability. But it's the it's the first step towards actually regulating these that, you know,
1963.60s: I think we as a society desperately need. I have two phone questions. The first one is, is the,
1970.00s: is your papers, they like openly accessible or is there like a paywall for it? No, no, it's, yeah,
1976.16s: it is open access and I'd be happy to send the link along and if you want, you can link to it.
1981.44s: Yeah, I would love to because I mean, one, I want to read it, but then two, I think it'd be really
1985.36s: cool for the people to check it out. So thank you. The other thing I wanted to ask you is,
1991.44s: I am generally confused as to how to perceive things like Facebook that are up to n. Like, how much
2002.88s: regulation should something be subjected to that's an opt-in service. You're not forced to use
2009.44s: Facebook. You can easily choose not to. So I'm like, where does this go when we start seeing more,
2017.20s: you know, broader government regulation on these private opt-in entities? I agree with the
2022.24s: sentiment to be, you know, abundantly clear. I think the misuse and mischaracterization of information
2027.20s: really needs to be addressed, but I am just curious like what the broader impact in the deeper
2031.20s: game is here because government regulation also has its shortfalls. Totally agree. And it's a very
2036.80s: fair question. And sometimes I do feel like I come off like a liberal and I'm first of all,
2043.04s: most certainly not. And I don't believe the government regulation is the answer to everything
2048.56s: or often anything. That being said, I do believe that corporate concentration of power and
2058.72s: monopoly is a problem. And Facebook is a monopoly. And not only are they a monopoly within social
2066.40s: media, but they are allowed to acquire something like Instagram or something like WhatsApp. And so
2071.68s: they can extend their monopoly power across different verticals. And that's where things get even
2076.96s: more problematic. So when you talk about regulating Facebook as a monopoly, you want to reduce their
2083.92s: economic power. And it's much of the same thing that I talk about in markets and market structure
2090.16s: is that we want to address corporate concentration of power. We want to get rid of monopolies and foster
2096.32s: competition. And I'm a very staunch believer that well-regulated competitive systems are the
2104.96s: best outcomes that we know of economically. And so I would say that it is a problem when existing
2113.04s: regulation allows firms like Facebook to acquire the kind of economic power that they have. So it's
2120.48s: not necessarily a question of do we add on more regulation. It's often a question of can we change
2130.08s: existing regulations that were probably written by the companies that have benefited the most
2135.20s: from them to be better structured to foster competition. And that's where I tend to fall on these
2141.76s: kinds of things. Got it. I love it. And that makes a lot of sense. I appreciate the clarification.
2146.56s: So we got about 15 minutes left. So I would have to start throwing some rapid fire tweets at you.
2156.64s: So this one it says imagine that brokers, oh, okay, let me not do, let me not give you a bad read
2162.72s: here. That was a bad read. It's supposed to be more like I think. Imagine that. Brokers, right?
2169.20s: Yes. Brokers routing for their own benefit rather than their customers results in worse execution
2176.72s: quality. Who would have seen that comment and so on and so forth. So I'm curious, you know,
2182.08s: you were retweeting a Dutch market study. And that in and of itself, I find interesting. I always find
2190.08s: like studies from other countries interesting because I always think that there's correlation,
2196.08s: but obviously there's, you know, it's not a direct carryover. But I think in this instance,
2201.36s: it's kind of direct carryover just for, you know, brokers. But anyways, yeah, just talk to me a little
2207.44s: bit about this tweet, you know, we've talked a little bit about brokers routing before, but I'd love
2213.04s: to get your broader thoughts on, you know, the competition improving outcomes concept of this and
2219.36s: so on and so forth. Yeah, that's right. So, you know, I think that this year is going to be a really
2224.88s: transformative year in market structure. And one of the most, one of the sort of central issues
2232.08s: that is going to be confronted by the securities and exchange commission is this idea of what are
2237.84s: called order routing inducements. And so when when a broker gets an order from a retail investor or
2244.24s: trader or even from an institutional investor, they have the duty of best execution. And that
2249.60s: duty means that they have to get the best possible price given the circumstances of the market at
2256.48s: the time. And also that they're allowed to consider other things, not just price. They can consider
2262.08s: size, they can consider, you know, various different metrics, but as far as retail traders and
2271.28s: investors go, the general metric that they're held to is price. And so the question is, are brokers
2278.88s: routing orders to achieve the aims of best execution or are brokers routing orders to make more
2285.68s: money for themselves through these inducements and those inducements include payment for order flow,
2291.52s: which the wholesalers like Citadel and Virtu pay to retail brokers like Robinhood and Schwab and TD
2298.96s: in order to get all those orders into their internal systems, execute against them, trade against
2304.80s: them and not expose them to the market at large. And the proponents of payment for order flow
2312.24s: will continually make this argument that retail has never had it better. They're getting the best
2316.48s: possible prices and they don't touch it. And the SEC is coming and they want to touch it. They
2322.32s: want to get rid of it much like other countries have done. Europe is considering exactly the same
2329.04s: thing. They don't have as much of a payment for order flow problem as the US does, but it is still
2335.68s: something that they're considering outlying in Europe as well. And so this Dutch study was
2340.56s: commissioned for those purposes because Europe wanted to see our investors getting the best possible
2346.72s: price and the answer was no. And this is not a surprise. This has been shown before
2351.68s: through all sorts of different studies in the US. And in fact, even this one retail broker public
2358.32s: dot com came out with a really interesting piece in last year showing that even under the existing
2364.56s: system, they're able to get better prices for their customers when they don't route to these
2368.96s: payment for order flow internalizers. And so I think that this issue is going to be front and
2374.40s: center, especially over the next month or so. I think March is there's going to be a lot of attention
2380.64s: on this in all sorts of ways. And I think the SEC is about to come in and say we want to end this
2386.72s: practice. And then I think at that point, it's going to kick off this battle between the internalizers
2393.52s: and the retail brokers on one side and everyone else involved in markets on the other side.
2400.08s: And if you know, good luck finding somebody who supports the practice, who isn't either making
2405.76s: money from it or who didn't make their money and their wealth from it in the past. I personally,
2412.64s: I think it's important to note, it doesn't matter. This issue has no commercial interest for me whatsoever.
2420.48s: I can I'm not going to make money one way or the other on how this issue has decided, but I've been
2426.24s: are doing it as practice for 11 years now, because I think it's bad for markets, it's bad for
2432.56s: institutions. And most of our wealth is in institutions, such as mutual funds and pension plans
2440.16s: and that kind of thing. And you know, the market, I believe, needs to work better for institutions.
2445.20s: And this would be a way to do that. It's interesting you say that because I think for a lot of retail
2452.72s: traders, the narrative, it's exactly as you say, right, where it may not be the best order flow,
2460.40s: but it's better, you know, than what they've seen before. So what do you see if the changes are made,
2468.64s: you know, that essentially start reducing him of order flow and things like that? What from a retail
2474.96s: trader perspective, what changes do you think trickle down to them? I think outcomes will improve
2481.20s: significantly. And I think it's a very simple straightforward argument, right? What is going to be
2487.04s: a better outcome when three firms are competing to give you the best price or when a thousand firms
2495.44s: are competing to give you the best price? Right. How much simpler can you get?
2504.96s: If you believe in capitalism and competition, then you're going to say a thousand firms, right? And
2509.76s: that's what I push for. I push for open competition for order flow. That retail orders should go
2517.12s: to a venue, to a transparent venue where anyone in the market could compete over them. And you know
2523.20s: what, if Citadel and Virtue are still providing the best possible prices, they will there too.
2529.52s: It's beautiful in that way, right? But you know what? They'll have to face competition from all
2534.40s: these other firms. And they're not going to be able to order off for it. Yeah. The other side of it
2539.76s: is that there was a good study that was done that measured something called toxicity on exchange.
2546.72s: And it said, and you know, unless you want to get deep into the issue, the thing you need to know is
2551.84s: that the orders from retail are not toxic. They are good to trade against. They're easier to make
2561.28s: money for market makers. And so by pushing those orders onto a transparent venue, you would reduce
2570.24s: the toxicity of that venue. And by reducing the toxicity of our lit markets, our exchanges in
2577.68s: the US, you would tighten spreads by 25% or more. That's why what that tells you, yes, what that tells you
2586.48s: is that payment for order flow is increasing the costs to trade for everyone in the market by 25%.
2594.32s: That's a huge number. And that's the kind of number that's eroding returns for pension plans,
2599.76s: that's adding to fees and mutual funds, and that retail traders and investors are facing too. So,
2605.52s: you know, I do believe strongly that you get all those orders into a transparent venue,
2610.48s: and everybody's outcomes would be far better except maybe for Citadel and Vertu and the retail
2615.76s: brokers. Do you think that the change will happen? Do you think it's gaining enough traction to see
2623.36s: the adjustment made or? I think the proposal is going to be made. And then I think it's going to be
2629.92s: up to the people that support it to be very vocal in supporting it because the ones that will
2639.52s: oppose it are going to be loud. They're going to be organized. They're very powerful interests.
2644.40s: They're going to be donating to political campaigns. And they already have Ken Griffen, the CEO of Citadel,
2651.12s: is the largest GOP donor in this cycle. And so, you know, that's what that's the war that is
2658.40s: essentially coming for market structure. But I mean, I'm very cautiously optimistic. It feels like
2665.52s: finally, all of these issues are kind of coming to a head this year. And I think it's going to be
2671.44s: a pretty big year for markets. Interesting. All right. So, we have another two we actually wanted to
2677.60s: look at this one next. So, hopefully made it a little easier for you to see. We got about
2683.92s: little less than 10 minutes left. But for this one, it's a press release that you are highlighting
2689.84s: from Pax's Global. And essentially, you know, the exciting part, it seems to kind of dovetail off
2696.80s: of that conversation where we might start to see an increase in competition in kind of the clearing
2703.44s: space. Does this follow similar logic to what you are kind of just outlining regarding order flow?
2710.48s: Or how do you view this impact to the market? I think it's similar and a little different. So,
2718.00s: again, yes, I'm just a believer in competition. And, you know, I have a traditional sort of capitalist
2725.44s: education and background. And so, you know, that's where I'm going to come down on a lot of issues.
2730.32s: But what I find so fascinating about Pax's, which I learned a lot about recently. And I learned
2737.92s: a lot about their technology is that this is not centralized clearing and settled. So, today,
2745.92s: you have the NSCC and the DTCC. And that's where trades are settled and cleared. And those are
2753.04s: centralized counterparts. And so, everyone on Wall Street has to face off against these centralized
2760.32s: counter parties. And they have to have enough margin on hand and enough capital on hand to manage
2766.48s: the settlement and clearing process for the entire industry. And having all of that
2775.04s: capital and taking the time, today's settlement is T plus two. We're going to be moving to T plus
2780.08s: one in two years. But even there, having capital and time held up is a risk. And it's a risk that
2788.40s: sort of everybody in the industry faces at a cost that everybody in the industry faces. And
2795.12s: what Pax has done is they've created a blockchain-based technology that essentially allows
2802.32s: counter parties to face off against each other. And that decentralized model, I find very
2808.64s: exciting. It's part and parcel of, you know, what can blockchain technology do? And where does
2814.80s: it make sense to use it versus let's say a database, for example? And this is one of those,
2821.76s: I would say relatively a few examples of where blockchain actually makes sense. And where the tech
2828.16s: is moving along. And, you know, so they got a no action letter from the SEC a couple years ago,
2833.12s: they proved out that they could do this in equities trading and settlement. And, you know, now they
2839.84s: have applied to be a registered clearing agency. And they would be the first new clearing agency
2846.72s: in over 10 years, which is that's I find that exciting. That's what I wanted to highlight actually.
2852.16s: Like this part is really what drew me to this tweet is exactly that. It's always an interesting
2858.72s: indicator of what a current, you know, niche looks like when entry looks like that, where nobody
2866.08s: has entered in a decade. And, you know, that is very, very interesting to me. So, do you think that
2873.20s: blockchain technology will give them at least space to compete in the current clearing space?
2881.92s: I think so. And I think what's even more interesting about the way that they have approached this
2888.48s: is that they've done it under the current securities laws. And it's getting, it would get very deep
2895.04s: in detail. I won't pretend to know as like an expert, you know, like the people at Paxos, but
2902.56s: there are other attempts to do this, which would require rewriting securities laws.
2908.24s: But the way that they have done this, it would not. And so, to me, that's what's most compelling is
2914.08s: that they can come in, fit within the current framework and build a better system that can better
2921.76s: track securities, better track shares as potentially as they're shorted and lent out and delivered,
2929.84s: as well as reducing the risk in cost in terms of time and capital required. So, all of this strikes
2938.96s: me as significant efficiencies that the industry can gain. And, you know, a lot of retail is very
2945.60s: concerned around the opacity and what they perceive as the corruption of the current settlement
2951.84s: and clearing agencies. And without coming down on any side of that issue, you know, this is the
2958.72s: kind of thing that maybe we'll give a lot of people more confidence in the system. And I think
2963.68s: that's important as well. Yeah, I think it's a beautiful summary, especially because when we talk
2970.08s: about blockchain, a lot of people think, you know, immediately cryptocurrencies. But this is one of
2975.68s: the things that I talk about with one of my friends who's in the space, he comes on the channel
2979.36s: every once in a while and he often brings up the application of blockchain technology to other,
2984.72s: you know, spheres to your point that might even make, I wouldn't say more sense, but equal to
2990.00s: sense at least as, you know, some of the cryptocurrency arguments. Yeah. And crypto is, you know,
2996.48s: when you talk cryptocurrencies, you're talking usually talking about sort of permissionless,
3000.56s: trustless distributed ledger technology, which are a lot of buzzwords. I know, but, you know,
3005.92s: it went on time to do a whole less than on blockchain and ledger distributed ledger technology. But,
3012.40s: you know, this is not that, in fact, this is a piece of blockchain technology, the smart contract
3018.40s: piece, because you don't need a system here that's distributed or trustless because the people
3025.60s: that would be engaging are all regulated entities and, you know, you know, you, it needs to be
3030.80s: permissioned. Right. But when you have this smart contract technology that can allow what are
3035.28s: called atomic swaps. So, I didn't lay, you know, that is a real step forward. And so that's what I
3042.48s: find to be so fascinating about what their approach has been. Yeah. I love it. The next tweet you have
3049.76s: here, and it's the last one for this before kind of closing up, but I just wanted to let you know
3055.76s: that I vehemently disagree with this. I'll never be able to put another successful trade-on if I
3061.60s: can't simply copy Nancy Pelosi. So, this is not only selfish of you.
3068.96s: Maybe it is devastating to the vast majority of retailers.
3075.28s: I'm sorry, I can't say. I just can't stand corruption. And I mean, I just the detriment of your
3084.80s: returns. This has been a hot butt night on for a long time. And I think something that you hit on
3092.64s: that I truly love maybe equal to your beard. I don't know. I probably love your beard a little more.
3100.72s: But it's the winter beard right now. So, it's the thicker. Yeah. I mean, that's what I'm about.
3107.76s: So, but it's where it says, you know, lawmakers and the families has the adherence of corruption.
3113.04s: I love that because part of it obviously is everybody just immediately looks and really like
3118.64s: that's corruption. And you are giving a more, I think, rational perception of this. You know,
3126.72s: not everybody in Congress is necessarily corrupt right out of the gate. You can argue that either
3131.76s: way, but you know, giving the benefit of the doubt, I like that you highlight the fact that even
3139.04s: the appearance of corruption, which I agree with, is detrimental in and of itself. It's the same thing,
3145.04s: you know, that we see in a private industry, you know, my wife, she works in big law.
3152.48s: There's a lot of restrictions on, you know, especially people in that are partners and what not.
3158.24s: There's all sorts of restrictions on all of them, not necessarily because of direct corruption,
3164.08s: but this right here, the appearance of corruption. And you see it in a lot of places. So,
3169.28s: just talk to me a little bit about your thoughts on this because I think a lot of people resonate
3173.04s: other than me, like I said, I'm really going to be in big trouble coming up with trade after this.
3176.96s: So, you know, I'm hoping this could stop and it's tracks, but you know, for other people that might
3182.32s: be interested in equitable and, you know, buzzwords like that. What are your thoughts here?
3189.36s: Look, I like that you've highlighted that I certainly think it's corrupt. I think the corruption
3198.56s: is staggering. My point in this is it doesn't even matter if it is, if they're corrupt or not,
3206.16s: that this is enough. Just the appearance, just the appearance. So, you know, yeah, that's right.
3210.16s: It gives them the benefit of the doubt. It doesn't matter. You can't, you want someone to change
3214.64s: a system that they are, you know, you're depending on the people who benefit the most from the
3219.84s: system to change it. And you're probably not going to get very far. If you just yell at them
3225.36s: at their faces and call them criminals, get them to see that it doesn't even matter if they are
3230.56s: or not. Right. If we don't trust our, you know, our leaders and we don't trust them to do the
3235.68s: right thing and we don't trust them to enter public service because of, you know, that it's service
3241.60s: versus a gateway to extreme wealth. That's that just attracts all the worst kind of people. And I
3249.04s: find the response of politicians, especially who have profited so much from it. What do you mean?
3255.36s: It's smart of the American economy. Right. Right. You know, we're all, you know, we're all part of
3260.00s: the market here or, you know, some have said, well, you won't attract people into Congress.
3267.20s: If they can't trade off of that position, like, are you kidding me? Like, it's the craziest
3274.08s: possible reaction. And all I can say is good. I don't want to attract those people, right.
3280.48s: Exactly. I want the people who are coming in because they want to serve and they want to try
3284.96s: and fix things, even if I don't agree with their views, right? At least they're trying to do the
3291.04s: right thing. And it's probably too much to hope for. It certainly has become in this day and age
3295.84s: too much to hope for. But, you know, maybe we can aspire to get back to that.
3299.84s: Well, for me, I actually like the fact that there's at least, you know, even some bills being
3304.88s: introduced, you know, I'm sure some of it might just be kind of for a show. But like, I like that
3311.60s: there's at least a conversation about it because, you know, as much as my annual PNL is going to
3317.60s: suffer from this sort of, you know, just huge drop in my strategy. I think it really is important,
3326.40s: especially because it's exactly as you say, nobody looks at this and whether or not they are
3332.24s: actively engaging in corruption and somehow, you know, Nancy Pelosi's husband, who's apparently
3338.88s: a fucking genius because the dude's made several hundred million over the last couple of years.
3342.72s: That's just really a track record. You know, I think that the appearance in and of itself is
3353.36s: more than enough to go off of. We have really high expectations of the military in a lot of these
3359.12s: senses. And I just blows my mind that it somehow doesn't permeate over to this group because,
3367.68s: you know, apparently capitalism and the economy access applies to certain people and not others.
3375.12s: Exactly. And, you know, it's just one of those things, it's a small thing, but a lot of these small
3381.36s: things, I think, add up and they're important. Yes. And if we want to get back to, you know,
3387.44s: a governable country, which it feels like the US is not really a governable country at the moment,
3394.48s: you know, I think it starts with rooting out corruption and it starts with rooting out,
3399.20s: you know, the revolving door and the influence of lobbying and, you know, political and campaign
3405.76s: finance for all of these things are sort of part and parcel of the same issue, which is to try and
3412.56s: get back to, you know, governing a country based on what's best versus what's best for the country
3418.96s: versus what's best for the individuals that have, you know, attained higher office. And so,
3424.16s: you know, I'm sure it's naively optimistic to hope we can get there, but, you know, I'll continue
3428.80s: to be the naive optimist. Well, you know, don't worry while you're doing that, as soon as this
3433.20s: gets struck down and I no longer can put food in my mouth, I'll just send you a bill on a monthly
3437.60s: basis. Pick me up. You know, Pelosi might have a good track record, but most of these politicians
3444.24s: actually don't. Yeah, I mean, it would be great to see this just changed, but,
3451.68s: cool, we're pretty much at time, but I definitely want to talk at least a couple minutes about
3457.68s: your platform that's coming out. I am so stoked about it. And, you know, I've, again, just full
3462.88s: disclaimer. I did invest in it because I truly believe in it. I love what you guys are doing.
3468.32s: But anyways, you know, just what's the latest there? I unfortunately wasn't able to make the
3471.92s: town hall last night. I'm looking forward to that recording, but would love, you know, just a
3476.16s: two-minute recap on what you guys are doing. Yeah, and of course, thank you for the support.
3480.80s: You know, it means a lot. We just, we take it very seriously. We crowdfunded our funding for
3488.56s: this and, you know, that gave us a base of investors of over 1,350 and it's an amazing sort of
3496.80s: foundation to be building from. And so, you know, our intention is that in about a month,
3503.28s: we're going to release an alpha version of it to our investors. And maybe four to six weeks
3510.16s: after that, we will open up beta. And so on the web, on the website right now, Irvin.finance,
3514.88s: you can sign up for the beta wait list. If you share your referral link, you can move up the beta
3519.52s: wait list to get access earlier. And, you know, what we're going to have, even early on, we're just
3525.76s: going to have fantastic data sets. The best data of the professional world, we have secured an
3533.28s: excellent sort of commercial arrangement. So it's going to, we'll be starting out, it'll have delayed
3540.32s: prices because there are processes we have to go through to get approval for showing real time.
3545.36s: But ultimately, probably by beta, we will have those approvals. And so we will have the highest
3551.20s: quality real time data. We'll have historical intraday data going back seven years. We will have
3557.04s: daily data that goes back to 1960. We will have the best sources of fundamental data and corporate
3563.12s: intelligence available. We'll have the kind of real time newsfeed that, you know, CNBC relies on.
3571.76s: And other trading desks. So, you know, from a real time news perspective, we're investing heavily
3577.20s: in that. So all of these data sources will be coming together to hopefully provide, you know, a
3582.88s: fantastic research experience for people, a way to understand markets. And then what we hope to
3590.80s: build on with that is sort of communities that come together to do due diligence and push out
3598.08s: research and strategies. So we see it sort of coming together as a substack for financial analysis.
3604.32s: And then we're also going to have all sorts of educational resources to help teach people
3607.92s: not markets, market structure, investing, trading, financial literacy. All of this stuff is a
3615.04s: real focus of ours. And then the last piece is advocacy where we're really trying to be a force
3621.12s: in this market structure debate that's going to be happening this year and beyond. And we're going
3625.12s: to try and make sure that markets are going to work better for people and be simpler and more transparent.
3630.16s: You guys are awesome. I'm literally super looking forward to it. And again, just for like the
3634.56s: sake of pure transparency, like Dave didn't ask me to invest. There was literally nothing there. I
3639.12s: asked him to look at the platform. And I literally just liked it. Like there's no promotional
3643.60s: agreement, anything like that. I just want all of that to be super clear because I really go out of
3647.68s: my way to just, you know, be transparent with people because there's such a lack of that. But yeah,
3654.32s: I'm literally so stoked about it. I can't wait to check it out. I think you guys are working on
3658.32s: something that's really powerful. I had a chance, you know, to work off of a Bloomberg terminal for
3662.48s: a while, which was a really great experience. And this seems something that retail traders will
3669.60s: benefit from tremendously as well as, you know, probably larger groups as well. And the last thing I
3674.72s: definitely want to know is one of the things that really sold me on you guys early on was kind of
3679.52s: that community aspect because that's one of really my missions with the YouTube channel is to
3684.64s: teach people how to learn to trade derivatives and options. Like I love teaching and I love the
3690.56s: space. And one of the biggest components of that is teaching people to work together because the
3696.16s: collective brain is way smarter than any single person. It's so cool, right? That I love the hive mind.
3701.68s: I'm blown away by the hive mind. And you know, I think that that that's our exact hope is that we
3708.00s: can provide, you know, like a lot of this a lot of the hive mind analysis has come out on Reddit,
3713.92s: for example, which is a fantastic system, but it's not built for that, you know, right? So we're
3720.56s: going to have a system that is built for that where you can, you know, do a very powerful
3726.40s: type of data visualization and analysis. And then you can take the product of that and embed it
3732.64s: in a post, for example, and share that with people. Others can collaborate. They can, you know,
3738.48s: check out what you're doing, change it, you know, offer revisions, communities can come together
3743.60s: to develop it. And then you can embed these things so that they continue to update, right?
3747.20s: That they're not static illustrations of what you're trying to show that they're changing over time,
3752.48s: as things change over time. So I just love the idea of building a platform to let people be creative
3759.04s: and work together. And then I don't even know what's going to come out of it, but I know it's going
3762.64s: to be really cool. Yeah, well, unlike the current, you know, waiting to see what happens with
3767.04s: Fed policy, I think this one we're eager to see how this one pans out because I agree with you.
3772.24s: It's going to be something special. So thank you guys for working on that. And as always,
3776.48s: Dave, absolute pleasure talking with you. Thank you for your time. And I'm looking forward to
3779.84s: connecting with you again. Yeah, likewise. Thanks Eric. It was fun. Take care.
