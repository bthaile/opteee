 Hey everybody, Eric here. I got Dave again and I figure what better timing with everything that we're seeing going on in the marketplace to kind of talk to the man that's pretty plugged in and you know, learn a little bit more what you're seeing in the landscape. So first off, welcome back great to have you again. I'm glad, you know, last time didn't scare you away. Yeah, thanks for having me. I really appreciate it and you know, appreciate you and your audience and the interest of what we're doing. So happy to talk about it. Tweet, yeah. So we have kind of a cool agenda today. I gave you, you know, just like a brief run through some of the things that I wanted to cover. But, you know, to start off, last time we spoke a lot about fiscal policy, you know, what the Fed involvement in the market has looked like. And essentially how we've essentially gone off the playbook. We're starting to do a lot of things that well, we, you know, the Fed is starting to do a lot of things that we just hadn't really seen before and we're not exactly sure where it leads us. So I thought what better way to pick up than, you know, resuming that conversation because we're starting to see some of the Fed's thoughts, the minutes are coming out or was it today or tomorrow that they come out from last month? Yeah, yeah, the minutes are coming out soon. We have a pretty big meeting scheduled what for next month, mid March, where we're expecting a rate raise and all those kinds of things. So I'd love to just start there and get your general thoughts on the current state of the marketplace as a whole and then even just maybe a little broader what the economic picture looks like to you. We don't have to stay in one bucket or the other just whatever comes to your mind. Sure, you know, I got to remember this for next time. I got this great t-shirt and it says, I survived the Fed rate hike of 2015 because at the time, it felt like it was a pretty big deal and it shows you like rates going down and then down and then like at the bottom, there's just like this little, right up, you know, when they hiked in 2015 and obviously, you know, they ended up undoing that. So it's funny because the last time we spoke, I remember this was what we end on as you're saying and I told you our team transitory and I remain, I will say, I remain team transitory and I sort of defer to economists who know a whole lot more about this than I do. I do have a background in economics but I'm not immersed in it on a day-to-day basis. So I mostly, you know, I kind of separate in terms of my knowledge, I separate the things that I study on a regular basis from, you know, the things other people study and I learned from on a regular basis and economics is probably in that second bucket. But, you know, I think when you sort of look at the inflation numbers, the argument against it being transitory is that it's not really being calculated correctly and that it is much worse than the number is, you know, the headline number of 7.5% makes it out to be and I think Phil Ackman, you know, has tried to make that particular case and saying that rental and I think rental prices are not being accounted for correctly and he had some other points on that. And then when you look at it from the sort of transitory perspective, when you pull a, first of all sort of assuming CPI is being calculated correctly and representative of what of the price pressures that people are facing, then like when you pull out used cars, it drops dramatically and so, you know, the right not buying a used car, your CPI is probably pretty significantly different. And now, you know, yeah, we're facing the highest rate of food inflation that we've seen in a long time. But then again, we saw, you know, those numbers drop a lot as the sort of pandemic set in and such. So again, I think we're going to start to see inflation slow down significantly. I think this was probably the highest print. That's what the people who I respect the most in economics are saying. And I think that's probably what the Fed thinks. I would say that there's an economist Claudius Am, who I find to have great analysis. She worked at the Fed for a long time. She's very active on Twitter and I find her analysis to be some of the more compelling analysis out there. So, you know, I'm kind of just talking about a lot of the things that she's been talking about. But you know, from her perspective, she thinks that the Fed is looking at all this very closely, that they're not going to overreact. A lot of people are saying, let's have an emergency meeting next week. Let's get a rate hike fast. I will say that I find it surprising that they're not stopping asset purchases. Right? There's another 20 billion for this month and they haven't signaled that they're stopping that. If I was, you know, in their shoes, which I'm obviously not, I would have assumed by now that would have ended maybe before they had indicated it would end at the very least. Because yeah, I agree that there's a rate hike coming. That should be no surprise. Everyone seems to agree on that. There's a big question on how much and how many. She thinks it's 25 basis points. You know, some people think 50 will be the first one. I don't know what the answer is. I don't know how markets are going to react. Because you're right. This is unprecedented. We are in an unprecedented situation and unprecedented conditions. Markets are getting a bit more volatile teams. We're seeing some, you know, they're kind of see-song now. We're seeing tech names really sell off when they have bad news. So, you know, all that is indicative to me that we're potentially going through sort of a regime change in markets, right? It's sort of the bad news, good news or as bad news, bad news. And we're starting to become the bad news. Now bad news get. And that's a big difference that you see generally more in a bear market than a bull market. But, you know, I've been wrong about that before for sure. So, you know, I think people that are forecasting right now, I find it hard to trust almost anyone. I don't think anyone really knows what's going to happen over what's going to unfold as the Fed tries to, you know, end asset purchases and emerge from zero-industry policy. It's going to be fascinating. That's for sure. Yeah, I'm still riveting. It's just seeing what happens here. It's just a riveting story. And it's like we were talking about last time, right? Like we really have no idea how this ends, how the market reacts. I mean, I've been blown away with how the markets looked right now in light of, you know, kind of the Fed tightening discussions. There's the whole Ukraine, Russia thing going on. And the market is like surprisingly not dropping. You know, it's very interesting to me how anytime you think you might be able to identify how the market might react to things. And then it just market just closed. And it's up a little bit. See, like that, I just don't get that. Right. And I mean, you know, this is like 24 hours where almost all the talk has been about a potential war that's starting. Yep. And the kind of sanctions that would be levied on Russia in the midst of that, you know, I am watching oil pretty closely. Yeah, it's near, it's near highs. Near like, yeah, what, three or five year highs. Right. And that's going to be driving, you know, that does help to drive inflation. But it also, you know, has a big, a pretty big impact, you know, economic, a broad economic impact. And, you know, if Russia does invade and the US levies and tens sanctions and so does the world and the price of oil really spikes, you know, that might be the thing that kind of cuts the market off at the knees. Yeah. I think something I've been considering a lot too is if things with Russia, you know, well, they started pulling back some of troops off the border. So a lot of people thought that was kind of a, you know, a dovish sentiment that they might be trying to reconcile peacefully. I think that was kind of part of what we saw in the market yesterday. But what I find to be even more interesting is as NATO is starting to kind of do the rallying call and get everybody aligned, I think it puts China in a fascinating position. And to me, that's really something that would just absolutely drop the hammer on just the economy in general right now is if China started to side more with Russia, if Russia was making its movements, you know, just in opposition essentially the Western powers and what not, obviously all conjecture, nobody knows. But I do think, you know, we see China's name starting to get involved. I can't think of many places where our economies are more intimately intertwined. And, you know, relationships with them starts deteriorating further. I can only imagine what that looks like. I mean, and you know, I think it's like this, it is a situation at the very least of kind of mutually assured destruction, right? Like China holds so many, so much of our debt that, you know, a problem for us, a certainly a problem for them. And it might be the only thing that it keeps things sane because I think you're right that China is the thing to watch. And it's the thing that I think everyone around the world is trying to separate from. And that's, you know, practically impossible. I think there are, you know, sort of the greatest geopolitical rival that we face. And, you know, certainly economic rival. And it's only going to get worse. So, you know, I think from from that perspective, they've got a lot of levers that they could pull that would be extremely bad for us. But, like I said, in doing that, they would be cutting off the nose despite the face, because, you know, they've got just as many entanglements into our economy as we have into theirs. Yeah, that's, and yeah, that's, it's just another one of those, the further you look at it, because I mean, obviously from like the geopolitical power side of things, there's one perspective. But then once you start understanding how the economies are so, so intertwined and dependent on one another, because a lot of people I think in the US, understandably, we see, you know, a lot of things made in China around the house. And a lot of people kind of just assume that that means China, it has a just overall dominant economy that's overwhelmed the US. I think obviously there's more to that story, especially once you start looking further at GDP and the kind of products that are moving in the level of technology that's being sold externally and things like that, that, you know, there's a disparity there that I don't think is as commonly known, but I just feel like the relationship between the two countries is just that if one starts doing any sort of significant sanctions opposed to the other, I just see it going downhill very fast right after that. I think so too. And, you know, I think it's a, it's a huge priority in the US to decouple from China. And I think that that should be something that the people pay way more attention to and that we pour way more resources into. I think one of our greatest sort of political failings is not making that one of the top issues in the country. And so, you know, I think if we could, from sort of a supply chain perspective and a manufacturing perspective decouple far more so from China, we would be in a much greater position because it would be worse for them as significant holders of our debt. Right. And it would be for us. Yep. If anything, go down. That's a really good point. So, there was a couple things that you brought up earlier that I wanted to make sure I circled back to one of which was some of your economic, your favorite economic sources of information on Twitter. I would be remiss if I didn't get a list of some of those people. I know that you already mentioned Claudia. Do you have anybody else that you would recommend, you know, if people just want to follow broader scale economics a little closer, anybody else that you'd recommend? You know, it's funny. Yeah, I follow people from sort of all across the spectrum. You know, I wouldn't necessarily endorse a lot of them, Chris. Sure. But I really find that getting other perspectives is worthwhile. You know, like Matt Stoller as an example, who is someone who really focuses on monopoly and corporate concentration. I find a lot of his analysis to be absolutely fascinating, extremely in depth and well supported. If you're not a liberal, you might not like him. He's very left. The same thing is someone called Noah Smith, who, you know, is very liberal. But I find him to be pretty measured when it comes to economic analysis. So, you know, I think off the top of my head, you know, that's most of what I tend to see in my stream. You know, there's Rohan Gray is another, another pretty good one who's, he's very much focused more on sort of, you know, like tech and digital currency issues. But you know, a lot of these, a lot of these people are, what I really like is when I read some of these analysis of modern monetary theory. And even in that left leaning group, you get sort of a very diverse set of perspectives and opinions on modern monetary theory, which is essentially like what we've been trying as a response to the pandemic. And for many of them, you know, they, they, I mean, you get, you get both perspectives, but Claudia, I think, for example, would consider this to be a triumph of modern monetary theory. And, you know, a demonstration that you can really kind of print your way out of a crisis without huge repercussions. And, you know, people might say, well, what about the inflation? But, you know, the, the, the inflation that we're seeing, again, if it ends up being transitory, is sort of an expected outcome of a, you know, it's sort of like a, it's more of a supply chain issue than a monetary policy. Quick, quick question on that. Sorry. Just, just for the, the transitory component, I am curious because, but like last time we talked about it, I was doing actually a bunch of research to try to get some ideas in terms of like what transitory inflation actually looks like. And I feel like that's just another area where people like me might have a really skewed perspective without looking at like a broader picture, right? Because I've been, like I said, I've been trading since like 2007. So my exposure to inflation is relatively small, right? Compared to just longer market durations and whatnot. So I would be really curious just to understand when you think of transitory inflation, like what are some of the defining features of that for you as you have a conversation about it, except I feel like a lot of people look at inflation right now and they're like, well, it's not transitory. It's been here for two months. You know what I mean? Like they kind of think it's been here for a few months. Sorry, it's three quarters, right? Right. You know, yeah, you know, I think that the way that it's been described to me is that it's a question of is it supply side inflation? Is it being driven by supply side or demand side? If it's driven by demand side, it's potentially more structural because that means it's being fed by, let's say, wage inflation and inflation expectations. Whereas if it's being driven by the supply side, it's because suddenly, like we're seeing supply chains have become constricted and tight and materials are hard to get. And so what happens is that then yes, prices rise, but actions are taken because of those higher prices to streamline and improve the supply side. And so it comes back to normal. So I think the way Claudia put it was, it's like an inflation impulse, right? It's like, it's an impulse that hits and it can be over a couple of quarters, right? It's not the kind of like when you say transitory, it doesn't mean like it's going to be a one month reading of high inflation and then gone, right? It's going to be a curve that goes up and then comes back down. And so that's, you know, what we would expect over the next few months is that, you know, hopefully we're at the peak and we start to see at least level off and then start to come back down. And so then we would look back at a couple of years and we would say, oh, yeah, inflation was elevated for two or three quarters. And that and or even a year, let's say, because the supply chains were completely, you know, screwed up. And like, you know, given what's happened with COVID and the, you know, people not being able to go to work and then, you know, the the weird sort of hoarding behaviors that we saw, we, you know, we really put our our supply chains under this intense level of stress that I don't think anyone had ever sort of contemplated before, you know, and now, yeah, we all have like a lifetime supply of toilet paper and paper towels. You know, we can't get ships to dock in the imports of LA, fast enough, right? So all this stuff is is a very weird situation that we find ourselves in, but you know, it's transitory. It means things are going to normalize again, right? I so it's so two things. The first one is I you are like the perfect match for like the stereotypical nice Canadian people because the way you phrased the awkward hoarding behavior, to me, I'm thinking just how psychotic human beings can be and completely nonsensical because it's like, I don't know, like I get it toilet paper is nice. I get it. But I guess for a lot of people, they don't realize like a good portion of the world goes without it. And I was worried about it's going to be like water. That's just, you know, the typical American, they're like, well, I'll worry about food later. Let me get this toilet paper. But the other thing that I'm actually really glad and I appreciate that explanation because that really falls in line with a lot of what I was reading more in more or less in terms of inflation being transitory is not directly tied to duration. And I think that a lot of people immediately feel if it's, you know, here for experience of time, especially people like me write millennials and it's even worse for younger people where our attention span is like 14 seconds. So if something's been here for a day, it's essentially there for eternity, you know. And yeah, that's a really good point. And you know, I think a good, maybe a good example, and this is off the top of my head. So it might not, you know, I'd probably have to look deeper into this. But if you think of sort of the stagflationary period of the 70s and early 80s, that's an excellent example of non-transitory inflation. So OPEC comes together to collude with about on oil prices and keep them elevated for an extended period of time and not to reflect supply demand equilibrium as well as economic growth slowing down. And, you know, suddenly, you had consistent, extremely high inflation that, you know, there are certainly multiple narratives about how it was dealt with. But one of those narratives is that vulgar, you know, spiked interest rates essentially torpedoed the economy, but got inflation under control. I think there are other sort of revisionist history theories as to what might have been more effective. And so I don't want to speak to that or endorse a view of it. I'm only bringing it up to say that that's sort of the example of inflation that you would not consider transitory and in which action and significant action was needed in order to address it. And so, you know, I don't think that's the case today. I think you already see Congress tightening from a fiscal policy perspective. Right? Inflation can be driven by monetary policy, fiscal policy or, you know, supply demand conditions. And, you know, if Congress is not going to pass like universal basic income or another massive social spending program, you know, that's going to be a fiscal force for tightening. And you've got the Fed as a monetary source, which will be tightening. And so it's, you know, to me, I think it's good that we can hope hopefully that the Fed will not overreact and that will ease into this tightening cycle. And, you know, if Powell can pull it off, it'll be really just an amazing success story of a massive disruption and dislocation to our economy and our world. And one in which, you know, the Fed responded, managed through it over, you know, frankly over multiple decades of crisis after crisis. And maybe we're about to come out of it. What do you say or what's your opinion, I should say, on all of the Bitcoin fanatics that say all of this government manipulation is cured by Bitcoin. What do you think about that? I'm not. So the reason I am not a retired Bitcoin multi-millionaire is because I don't believe that. You know, I own a whole lot of Bitcoin as early as one. Oh, that's right. We talked about that. You had both made the same mistake, man. Yeah. I bought it at $2. But I was never a true believer. I was a trader and I traded out of it. And I have friends that were true believers. And, you know, they can do whatever they want now because they're filthy rich. So, but most of those people, they'll just keep holding it anyways. You know, somebody will never I got converted to fiat. Yeah, I got 15 million in there, but it's going to keep going. That's right. They will never pay taxes on that. You could kill them before they're going to pay tax to the government. So, you know, I'm not a Bitcoin maximalist. I'm not a libertarian. I love crypto. I think it's amazing technology. I think that it's got a place in our economy and our market. But it does Bitcoin fix this so far not so far. It has not been proven to be an effective inflation hedge. So, you know, it's sort of like we're at the point where the proofs in the pudding, right? Like if it is going to fix this and address it, it should be doing that. It should be going up as inflation goes up, which it hasn't because it's just it's a very volatile sort of devil asset class. And, you know, I don't know, maybe 10, 20 years from now, it'll be more stable and it will respond in the way they expect. But I think that's pure conjecture. I think so too. The other thing that I think about is if the idea of Bitcoin is that it's like universal currency, right? It's border or borderless. Inflation changes in different countries at different points in time. So, like, what happens with that? So, yeah, I largely agree that there is a place for Bitcoin. I think it's just a really, really fast. I have Bitcoin right now. Like, I'm just I'm fascinated by it. I think that it has potential in certain ways. But I've always been skeptical by, you know, the really, really Bitcoin evangelists that are essentially saying, you know, if you have cancer, go get Bitcoin and now you're good. You know, it's just, yeah. I'm a good friend who is one of those and, you know, more power to him. He's done pretty well thanks to it. But just home to sell. And I think there's always I like the saying, you know, don't ever confuse luck with skill. Yeah. And, you know, I think that we'll see. And I do think that Bitcoin will can will be an excellent investment over the long haul. And I've got some substantial exposure to different cryptos. And, you know, some real strong thoughts on where my money is going, which is, you know, I'm not putting new money into Bitcoin. I put it mostly into Avalanche. I think Avalanche is a far better technology. And, you know, I tend to approach things from a tech perspective more than sort of a, you know, monetary structure person. Probably one. Actually, I don't even know if anyone knows what this EFF shirt is, but they are a non-profit that is standing up for you and your rights to digital online security and privacy. They're safeguarding. Oh, that's a good technology is from government interference. And they are a non-profit that I'm a strong supporter of. And us nerds have to band together and hold the line. Speaking of nerds doing the right thing, did you see the news about Google? They're starting to potentially re. I didn't read the article away through. So I'm probably coming off as 95% ignorant, you know, 5% surplus than my usual. But I am, it was talking about essentially some user rights adjustments to their current policies. Again, it's very broad, but they were comparing it to kind of like what Facebook did with, I'm sorry, what Apple did with some of, you know, like the privacy standards within the marketplace, you know, for like their app store and whatnot. Have you seen any of that yet? It was literally today. So you might not have. I did not see it today. This is a perfect segment and talking about the algorithmic accountability act. I would not trust Google. There it is. Okay, there you go. Yeah. So for just a couple of minutes, I wanted to pull up some tweets that Dave made mostly because I like looking at his profile picture. It's very dapper, I must say, um, much younger Dave. Yeah. But one of the, you should see any of like my professional photos. It's when I was still clean shaven. I don't have a beard in any of them. So I am like the ultimate professional catfish because as soon as somebody sees me after they look at my LinkedIn phone, they're like, who the hell is this guy? But anyways, this actually was one of the things I really wanted to talk to you about was the algorithmic accountability act, which I was saying, I never heard about that before you kind of like that sweatshirt you're wearing, which I'm gonna check them out afterwards. You're always full of fun things to check out. So anyways, you know, I'd love to hear just a little bit more about what you find interesting about the algorithmic accountability act. Yeah, so for the last couple of years, I've been involved in the AI space. And I actually, I sit on the editorial board for the Journal of AI and Ethics and you know, the ethical use of AI is something I care very deeply about and the misuse of personal data is also something that I care very deeply about. And it's why everybody who is listening to this should delete their Facebook account right now. What Facebook has done is horrific. They've destroyed civil society all in the name of it. And they've set us against each other. And I think that they have no ethics for morals whatsoever. I got it. I'm sorry. I got to ask though, what are like some of the things you're referring to like bundled into that statement? Okay. So I wrote a piece on this. Good. In the Journal, it was an editorial. And in it, you know, I explained that, you know, the Facebook claims to be about building community and bringing people closer together. But what they really do is they have algorithms that separate us into filter bubbles. And so they control the information that we see. And these algorithms are engineered to maximize engagement and to maximize engagement, you need to make people angry and outraged. And that is the core of this outrage machine. And that is the entire business model of Facebook. I had an interaction with Facebook's chief AI scientist. Oh, pretty much just exactly a year ago on Twitter. And he said that I had no idea what I was talking about. And that Facebook's AI solves hate speech that it solves, calls violence and bullying. And it is able to effectively filter out disinformation that invangers public safety or the integrity of the democratic process. So I'll wait while everybody stops laughing. Yeah. Just takes it sounds right up the rally. It sounds like it's a liar. What an absurd thing to claim that you're AI can do. And so instead of responding to him on Twitter, I wrote this really extensive piece in the Journal of AI and Ethics with a really extensive amount of information and study to show how bad their algorithms are, how they do cost polarization and echo chambers and to show that they're, it is part of their business. Their business is to get us angry and to make us hate each other. It makes sense too because if you think about, oh, I'm sorry. I mean, it just like it popped in my mind like most of these, you know, TV shows on Netflix and stuff, a lot of them are driven just by drama. Like people love drama. So it does not surprise me in any way, you know, what you're saying that a social media platform is applying a similar construct. Yes, that's right. Exactly. And, you know, they have supported genocide. They have supported governments acting against their own citizens. They have, they have made cyber bullying worse and they have made us all dumber and they have made it so that the information we believe is completely divorced from reality. And so the Algarismic Accountability Act is an attempt to start to put some guardrails on algorithms that impact people significantly. And that would apply to Facebook, that would apply to Google search engines that would apply to Twitter recommendation algorithms, any of these systems that are algorithmically controlling what we see and recommending what we look at would need to have at the very least, you know, impact assessments being done to understand what both what the impact of those algorithms are and what changes to those algorithms would entail. And, you know, it's just like the barest minimum of accountability. But it's the it's the first step towards actually regulating these that, you know, I think we as a society desperately need. I have two phone questions. The first one is, is the, is your papers, they like openly accessible or is there like a paywall for it? No, no, it's, yeah, it is open access and I'd be happy to send the link along and if you want, you can link to it. Yeah, I would love to because I mean, one, I want to read it, but then two, I think it'd be really cool for the people to check it out. So thank you. The other thing I wanted to ask you is, I am generally confused as to how to perceive things like Facebook that are up to n. Like, how much regulation should something be subjected to that's an opt-in service. You're not forced to use Facebook. You can easily choose not to. So I'm like, where does this go when we start seeing more, you know, broader government regulation on these private opt-in entities? I agree with the sentiment to be, you know, abundantly clear. I think the misuse and mischaracterization of information really needs to be addressed, but I am just curious like what the broader impact in the deeper game is here because government regulation also has its shortfalls. Totally agree. And it's a very fair question. And sometimes I do feel like I come off like a liberal and I'm first of all, most certainly not. And I don't believe the government regulation is the answer to everything or often anything. That being said, I do believe that corporate concentration of power and monopoly is a problem. And Facebook is a monopoly. And not only are they a monopoly within social media, but they are allowed to acquire something like Instagram or something like WhatsApp. And so they can extend their monopoly power across different verticals. And that's where things get even more problematic. So when you talk about regulating Facebook as a monopoly, you want to reduce their economic power. And it's much of the same thing that I talk about in markets and market structure is that we want to address corporate concentration of power. We want to get rid of monopolies and foster competition. And I'm a very staunch believer that well-regulated competitive systems are the best outcomes that we know of economically. And so I would say that it is a problem when existing regulation allows firms like Facebook to acquire the kind of economic power that they have. So it's not necessarily a question of do we add on more regulation. It's often a question of can we change existing regulations that were probably written by the companies that have benefited the most from them to be better structured to foster competition. And that's where I tend to fall on these kinds of things. Got it. I love it. And that makes a lot of sense. I appreciate the clarification. So we got about 15 minutes left. So I would have to start throwing some rapid fire tweets at you. So this one it says imagine that brokers, oh, okay, let me not do, let me not give you a bad read here. That was a bad read. It's supposed to be more like I think. Imagine that. Brokers, right? Yes. Brokers routing for their own benefit rather than their customers results in worse execution quality. Who would have seen that comment and so on and so forth. So I'm curious, you know, you were retweeting a Dutch market study. And that in and of itself, I find interesting. I always find like studies from other countries interesting because I always think that there's correlation, but obviously there's, you know, it's not a direct carryover. But I think in this instance, it's kind of direct carryover just for, you know, brokers. But anyways, yeah, just talk to me a little bit about this tweet, you know, we've talked a little bit about brokers routing before, but I'd love to get your broader thoughts on, you know, the competition improving outcomes concept of this and so on and so forth. Yeah, that's right. So, you know, I think that this year is going to be a really transformative year in market structure. And one of the most, one of the sort of central issues that is going to be confronted by the securities and exchange commission is this idea of what are called order routing inducements. And so when when a broker gets an order from a retail investor or trader or even from an institutional investor, they have the duty of best execution. And that duty means that they have to get the best possible price given the circumstances of the market at the time. And also that they're allowed to consider other things, not just price. They can consider size, they can consider, you know, various different metrics, but as far as retail traders and investors go, the general metric that they're held to is price. And so the question is, are brokers routing orders to achieve the aims of best execution or are brokers routing orders to make more money for themselves through these inducements and those inducements include payment for order flow, which the wholesalers like Citadel and Virtu pay to retail brokers like Robinhood and Schwab and TD in order to get all those orders into their internal systems, execute against them, trade against them and not expose them to the market at large. And the proponents of payment for order flow will continually make this argument that retail has never had it better. They're getting the best possible prices and they don't touch it. And the SEC is coming and they want to touch it. They want to get rid of it much like other countries have done. Europe is considering exactly the same thing. They don't have as much of a payment for order flow problem as the US does, but it is still something that they're considering outlying in Europe as well. And so this Dutch study was commissioned for those purposes because Europe wanted to see our investors getting the best possible price and the answer was no. And this is not a surprise. This has been shown before through all sorts of different studies in the US. And in fact, even this one retail broker public dot com came out with a really interesting piece in last year showing that even under the existing system, they're able to get better prices for their customers when they don't route to these payment for order flow internalizers. And so I think that this issue is going to be front and center, especially over the next month or so. I think March is there's going to be a lot of attention on this in all sorts of ways. And I think the SEC is about to come in and say we want to end this practice. And then I think at that point, it's going to kick off this battle between the internalizers and the retail brokers on one side and everyone else involved in markets on the other side. And if you know, good luck finding somebody who supports the practice, who isn't either making money from it or who didn't make their money and their wealth from it in the past. I personally, I think it's important to note, it doesn't matter. This issue has no commercial interest for me whatsoever. I can I'm not going to make money one way or the other on how this issue has decided, but I've been are doing it as practice for 11 years now, because I think it's bad for markets, it's bad for institutions. And most of our wealth is in institutions, such as mutual funds and pension plans and that kind of thing. And you know, the market, I believe, needs to work better for institutions. And this would be a way to do that. It's interesting you say that because I think for a lot of retail traders, the narrative, it's exactly as you say, right, where it may not be the best order flow, but it's better, you know, than what they've seen before. So what do you see if the changes are made, you know, that essentially start reducing him of order flow and things like that? What from a retail trader perspective, what changes do you think trickle down to them? I think outcomes will improve significantly. And I think it's a very simple straightforward argument, right? What is going to be a better outcome when three firms are competing to give you the best price or when a thousand firms are competing to give you the best price? Right. How much simpler can you get? If you believe in capitalism and competition, then you're going to say a thousand firms, right? And that's what I push for. I push for open competition for order flow. That retail orders should go to a venue, to a transparent venue where anyone in the market could compete over them. And you know what, if Citadel and Virtue are still providing the best possible prices, they will there too. It's beautiful in that way, right? But you know what? They'll have to face competition from all these other firms. And they're not going to be able to order off for it. Yeah. The other side of it is that there was a good study that was done that measured something called toxicity on exchange. And it said, and you know, unless you want to get deep into the issue, the thing you need to know is that the orders from retail are not toxic. They are good to trade against. They're easier to make money for market makers. And so by pushing those orders onto a transparent venue, you would reduce the toxicity of that venue. And by reducing the toxicity of our lit markets, our exchanges in the US, you would tighten spreads by 25% or more. That's why what that tells you, yes, what that tells you is that payment for order flow is increasing the costs to trade for everyone in the market by 25%. That's a huge number. And that's the kind of number that's eroding returns for pension plans, that's adding to fees and mutual funds, and that retail traders and investors are facing too. So, you know, I do believe strongly that you get all those orders into a transparent venue, and everybody's outcomes would be far better except maybe for Citadel and Vertu and the retail brokers. Do you think that the change will happen? Do you think it's gaining enough traction to see the adjustment made or? I think the proposal is going to be made. And then I think it's going to be up to the people that support it to be very vocal in supporting it because the ones that will oppose it are going to be loud. They're going to be organized. They're very powerful interests. They're going to be donating to political campaigns. And they already have Ken Griffen, the CEO of Citadel, is the largest GOP donor in this cycle. And so, you know, that's what that's the war that is essentially coming for market structure. But I mean, I'm very cautiously optimistic. It feels like finally, all of these issues are kind of coming to a head this year. And I think it's going to be a pretty big year for markets. Interesting. All right. So, we have another two we actually wanted to look at this one next. So, hopefully made it a little easier for you to see. We got about little less than 10 minutes left. But for this one, it's a press release that you are highlighting from Pax's Global. And essentially, you know, the exciting part, it seems to kind of dovetail off of that conversation where we might start to see an increase in competition in kind of the clearing space. Does this follow similar logic to what you are kind of just outlining regarding order flow? Or how do you view this impact to the market? I think it's similar and a little different. So, again, yes, I'm just a believer in competition. And, you know, I have a traditional sort of capitalist education and background. And so, you know, that's where I'm going to come down on a lot of issues. But what I find so fascinating about Pax's, which I learned a lot about recently. And I learned a lot about their technology is that this is not centralized clearing and settled. So, today, you have the NSCC and the DTCC. And that's where trades are settled and cleared. And those are centralized counterparts. And so, everyone on Wall Street has to face off against these centralized counter parties. And they have to have enough margin on hand and enough capital on hand to manage the settlement and clearing process for the entire industry. And having all of that capital and taking the time, today's settlement is T plus two. We're going to be moving to T plus one in two years. But even there, having capital and time held up is a risk. And it's a risk that sort of everybody in the industry faces at a cost that everybody in the industry faces. And what Pax has done is they've created a blockchain-based technology that essentially allows counter parties to face off against each other. And that decentralized model, I find very exciting. It's part and parcel of, you know, what can blockchain technology do? And where does it make sense to use it versus let's say a database, for example? And this is one of those, I would say relatively a few examples of where blockchain actually makes sense. And where the tech is moving along. And, you know, so they got a no action letter from the SEC a couple years ago, they proved out that they could do this in equities trading and settlement. And, you know, now they have applied to be a registered clearing agency. And they would be the first new clearing agency in over 10 years, which is that's I find that exciting. That's what I wanted to highlight actually. Like this part is really what drew me to this tweet is exactly that. It's always an interesting indicator of what a current, you know, niche looks like when entry looks like that, where nobody has entered in a decade. And, you know, that is very, very interesting to me. So, do you think that blockchain technology will give them at least space to compete in the current clearing space? I think so. And I think what's even more interesting about the way that they have approached this is that they've done it under the current securities laws. And it's getting, it would get very deep in detail. I won't pretend to know as like an expert, you know, like the people at Paxos, but there are other attempts to do this, which would require rewriting securities laws. But the way that they have done this, it would not. And so, to me, that's what's most compelling is that they can come in, fit within the current framework and build a better system that can better track securities, better track shares as potentially as they're shorted and lent out and delivered, as well as reducing the risk in cost in terms of time and capital required. So, all of this strikes me as significant efficiencies that the industry can gain. And, you know, a lot of retail is very concerned around the opacity and what they perceive as the corruption of the current settlement and clearing agencies. And without coming down on any side of that issue, you know, this is the kind of thing that maybe we'll give a lot of people more confidence in the system. And I think that's important as well. Yeah, I think it's a beautiful summary, especially because when we talk about blockchain, a lot of people think, you know, immediately cryptocurrencies. But this is one of the things that I talk about with one of my friends who's in the space, he comes on the channel every once in a while and he often brings up the application of blockchain technology to other, you know, spheres to your point that might even make, I wouldn't say more sense, but equal to sense at least as, you know, some of the cryptocurrency arguments. Yeah. And crypto is, you know, when you talk cryptocurrencies, you're talking usually talking about sort of permissionless, trustless distributed ledger technology, which are a lot of buzzwords. I know, but, you know, it went on time to do a whole less than on blockchain and ledger distributed ledger technology. But, you know, this is not that, in fact, this is a piece of blockchain technology, the smart contract piece, because you don't need a system here that's distributed or trustless because the people that would be engaging are all regulated entities and, you know, you know, you, it needs to be permissioned. Right. But when you have this smart contract technology that can allow what are called atomic swaps. So, I didn't lay, you know, that is a real step forward. And so that's what I find to be so fascinating about what their approach has been. Yeah. I love it. The next tweet you have here, and it's the last one for this before kind of closing up, but I just wanted to let you know that I vehemently disagree with this. I'll never be able to put another successful trade-on if I can't simply copy Nancy Pelosi. So, this is not only selfish of you. Maybe it is devastating to the vast majority of retailers. I'm sorry, I can't say. I just can't stand corruption. And I mean, I just the detriment of your returns. This has been a hot butt night on for a long time. And I think something that you hit on that I truly love maybe equal to your beard. I don't know. I probably love your beard a little more. But it's the winter beard right now. So, it's the thicker. Yeah. I mean, that's what I'm about. So, but it's where it says, you know, lawmakers and the families has the adherence of corruption. I love that because part of it obviously is everybody just immediately looks and really like that's corruption. And you are giving a more, I think, rational perception of this. You know, not everybody in Congress is necessarily corrupt right out of the gate. You can argue that either way, but you know, giving the benefit of the doubt, I like that you highlight the fact that even the appearance of corruption, which I agree with, is detrimental in and of itself. It's the same thing, you know, that we see in a private industry, you know, my wife, she works in big law. There's a lot of restrictions on, you know, especially people in that are partners and what not. There's all sorts of restrictions on all of them, not necessarily because of direct corruption, but this right here, the appearance of corruption. And you see it in a lot of places. So, just talk to me a little bit about your thoughts on this because I think a lot of people resonate other than me, like I said, I'm really going to be in big trouble coming up with trade after this. So, you know, I'm hoping this could stop and it's tracks, but you know, for other people that might be interested in equitable and, you know, buzzwords like that. What are your thoughts here? Look, I like that you've highlighted that I certainly think it's corrupt. I think the corruption is staggering. My point in this is it doesn't even matter if it is, if they're corrupt or not, that this is enough. Just the appearance, just the appearance. So, you know, yeah, that's right. It gives them the benefit of the doubt. It doesn't matter. You can't, you want someone to change a system that they are, you know, you're depending on the people who benefit the most from the system to change it. And you're probably not going to get very far. If you just yell at them at their faces and call them criminals, get them to see that it doesn't even matter if they are or not. Right. If we don't trust our, you know, our leaders and we don't trust them to do the right thing and we don't trust them to enter public service because of, you know, that it's service versus a gateway to extreme wealth. That's that just attracts all the worst kind of people. And I find the response of politicians, especially who have profited so much from it. What do you mean? It's smart of the American economy. Right. Right. You know, we're all, you know, we're all part of the market here or, you know, some have said, well, you won't attract people into Congress. If they can't trade off of that position, like, are you kidding me? Like, it's the craziest possible reaction. And all I can say is good. I don't want to attract those people, right. Exactly. I want the people who are coming in because they want to serve and they want to try and fix things, even if I don't agree with their views, right? At least they're trying to do the right thing. And it's probably too much to hope for. It certainly has become in this day and age too much to hope for. But, you know, maybe we can aspire to get back to that. Well, for me, I actually like the fact that there's at least, you know, even some bills being introduced, you know, I'm sure some of it might just be kind of for a show. But like, I like that there's at least a conversation about it because, you know, as much as my annual PNL is going to suffer from this sort of, you know, just huge drop in my strategy. I think it really is important, especially because it's exactly as you say, nobody looks at this and whether or not they are actively engaging in corruption and somehow, you know, Nancy Pelosi's husband, who's apparently a fucking genius because the dude's made several hundred million over the last couple of years. That's just really a track record. You know, I think that the appearance in and of itself is more than enough to go off of. We have really high expectations of the military in a lot of these senses. And I just blows my mind that it somehow doesn't permeate over to this group because, you know, apparently capitalism and the economy access applies to certain people and not others. Exactly. And, you know, it's just one of those things, it's a small thing, but a lot of these small things, I think, add up and they're important. Yes. And if we want to get back to, you know, a governable country, which it feels like the US is not really a governable country at the moment, you know, I think it starts with rooting out corruption and it starts with rooting out, you know, the revolving door and the influence of lobbying and, you know, political and campaign finance for all of these things are sort of part and parcel of the same issue, which is to try and get back to, you know, governing a country based on what's best versus what's best for the country versus what's best for the individuals that have, you know, attained higher office. And so, you know, I'm sure it's naively optimistic to hope we can get there, but, you know, I'll continue to be the naive optimist. Well, you know, don't worry while you're doing that, as soon as this gets struck down and I no longer can put food in my mouth, I'll just send you a bill on a monthly basis. Pick me up. You know, Pelosi might have a good track record, but most of these politicians actually don't. Yeah, I mean, it would be great to see this just changed, but, cool, we're pretty much at time, but I definitely want to talk at least a couple minutes about your platform that's coming out. I am so stoked about it. And, you know, I've, again, just full disclaimer. I did invest in it because I truly believe in it. I love what you guys are doing. But anyways, you know, just what's the latest there? I unfortunately wasn't able to make the town hall last night. I'm looking forward to that recording, but would love, you know, just a two-minute recap on what you guys are doing. Yeah, and of course, thank you for the support. You know, it means a lot. We just, we take it very seriously. We crowdfunded our funding for this and, you know, that gave us a base of investors of over 1,350 and it's an amazing sort of foundation to be building from. And so, you know, our intention is that in about a month, we're going to release an alpha version of it to our investors. And maybe four to six weeks after that, we will open up beta. And so on the web, on the website right now, Irvin.finance, you can sign up for the beta wait list. If you share your referral link, you can move up the beta wait list to get access earlier. And, you know, what we're going to have, even early on, we're just going to have fantastic data sets. The best data of the professional world, we have secured an excellent sort of commercial arrangement. So it's going to, we'll be starting out, it'll have delayed prices because there are processes we have to go through to get approval for showing real time. But ultimately, probably by beta, we will have those approvals. And so we will have the highest quality real time data. We'll have historical intraday data going back seven years. We will have daily data that goes back to 1960. We will have the best sources of fundamental data and corporate intelligence available. We'll have the kind of real time newsfeed that, you know, CNBC relies on. And other trading desks. So, you know, from a real time news perspective, we're investing heavily in that. So all of these data sources will be coming together to hopefully provide, you know, a fantastic research experience for people, a way to understand markets. And then what we hope to build on with that is sort of communities that come together to do due diligence and push out research and strategies. So we see it sort of coming together as a substack for financial analysis. And then we're also going to have all sorts of educational resources to help teach people not markets, market structure, investing, trading, financial literacy. All of this stuff is a real focus of ours. And then the last piece is advocacy where we're really trying to be a force in this market structure debate that's going to be happening this year and beyond. And we're going to try and make sure that markets are going to work better for people and be simpler and more transparent. You guys are awesome. I'm literally super looking forward to it. And again, just for like the sake of pure transparency, like Dave didn't ask me to invest. There was literally nothing there. I asked him to look at the platform. And I literally just liked it. Like there's no promotional agreement, anything like that. I just want all of that to be super clear because I really go out of my way to just, you know, be transparent with people because there's such a lack of that. But yeah, I'm literally so stoked about it. I can't wait to check it out. I think you guys are working on something that's really powerful. I had a chance, you know, to work off of a Bloomberg terminal for a while, which was a really great experience. And this seems something that retail traders will benefit from tremendously as well as, you know, probably larger groups as well. And the last thing I definitely want to know is one of the things that really sold me on you guys early on was kind of that community aspect because that's one of really my missions with the YouTube channel is to teach people how to learn to trade derivatives and options. Like I love teaching and I love the space. And one of the biggest components of that is teaching people to work together because the collective brain is way smarter than any single person. It's so cool, right? That I love the hive mind. I'm blown away by the hive mind. And you know, I think that that that's our exact hope is that we can provide, you know, like a lot of this a lot of the hive mind analysis has come out on Reddit, for example, which is a fantastic system, but it's not built for that, you know, right? So we're going to have a system that is built for that where you can, you know, do a very powerful type of data visualization and analysis. And then you can take the product of that and embed it in a post, for example, and share that with people. Others can collaborate. They can, you know, check out what you're doing, change it, you know, offer revisions, communities can come together to develop it. And then you can embed these things so that they continue to update, right? That they're not static illustrations of what you're trying to show that they're changing over time, as things change over time. So I just love the idea of building a platform to let people be creative and work together. And then I don't even know what's going to come out of it, but I know it's going to be really cool. Yeah, well, unlike the current, you know, waiting to see what happens with Fed policy, I think this one we're eager to see how this one pans out because I agree with you. It's going to be something special. So thank you guys for working on that. And as always, Dave, absolute pleasure talking with you. Thank you for your time. And I'm looking forward to connecting with you again. Yeah, likewise. Thanks Eric. It was fun. Take care.
