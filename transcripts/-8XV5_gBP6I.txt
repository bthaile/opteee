0.00s:  Hey everybody, Eric here. I got Dave again and I figure what better timing with everything
8.12s:  that we're seeing going on in the marketplace to kind of talk to the man that's pretty plugged
12.32s:  in and you know, learn a little bit more what you're seeing in the landscape. So first
17.48s:  off, welcome back, great to have you again. I'm glad, you know, last time didn't scare you
21.44s:  away.
22.44s:  Yeah. Thanks for having me. I really appreciate it and you know, appreciate you and your
27.28s:  audience and the interest in what we're doing. So happy to talk about it.
31.32s:  Tweet, yeah. So we have kind of a cool agenda today. I gave you, you know, just like a brief
35.42s:  run through some of the things that I wanted to cover. But you know, to start off, last
40.04s:  time we spoke a lot about physical policy, you know, what the Fed involvement in the market
45.16s:  has looked like and essentially how we've essentially gone off the playbook. We're
50.68s:  starting to do a lot of things that, well, we, you know, the Fed is starting to do a lot
56.72s:  of things that we just hadn't really seen before and we're not exactly sure where it leads
61.80s:  us. So I thought what better way to pick up than, you know, resuming that conversation
66.88s:  because we're starting to see some of the Fed's thoughts, the minutes are coming out
71.36s:  or was it today or tomorrow that they come out from last month? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
76.60s:  The minutes are coming out soon. We have a pretty big meeting scheduled what for next
81.80s:  month, mid March, where we're expecting a rate raise and all those kinds of things.
85.36s:  So I'd love to just start there and get your general thoughts on the current state of
91.40s:  the marketplace as a whole and then even just maybe a little broader what the economic
96.64s:  picture looks like to you. We don't have to stay in one bucket or the other, just whatever
99.80s:  comes to your mind. Sure. You know, I got to remember this for next time. I got this
103.96s:  great t-shirt and it says, I survived the Fed rate hike of 2015 because at the time,
110.64s:  it felt like it was a pretty big deal and it shows you like rates going down, down
114.88s:  and then down and then like at the bottom, it's just like this little, right up, you
118.24s:  know, when they hiked in 2015 and obviously, you know, they ended up undoing that. So it's
125.68s:  funny because the last time we spoke, I remember this was what we end on as you're saying
132.40s:  and I told you I was Team Transitory and I remain, I will say, I remain Team Transitory
140.08s:  and I sort of defer to economists who know a whole lot more about this than I do. I do
147.16s:  have a background in economics but I'm not immersed in it on a day-to-day basis. So I mostly,
154.40s:  you know, I kind of separate in terms of my knowledge, I separate the things that I study
160.20s:  on a regular basis from, you know, the things other people study and I learned from on a regular
166.08s:  basis and economics is probably in that second bucket. But, you know, I think when you sort of look
173.52s:  at the inflation numbers, the argument against them against it being Transitory is that it's not
180.64s:  really being calculated correctly and that it is much worse than the number is, you know, the
186.64s:  headline number of 7.5% makes it out to be and I think Phil Ackman, you know, has tried to make
192.48s:  that particular case and saying that rental and I think rental prices are not being accounted
198.96s:  for correctly and he had some other points on that. And then when you look at it from the sort of
204.08s:  Transitory perspective, when you pull a, first of all sort of assuming CPI is being calculated
211.52s:  correctly and representative of what of the price pressures that people are facing, then like,
216.88s:  when you pull out used cars, it drops dramatically and so, you know, the,
223.44s:  right, not buying a used car, your CPI is probably pretty significantly different and now,
228.96s:  you know, yeah, we're facing the highest rate of food inflation that we've seen in a long time,
233.52s:  but then again, we saw, you know, those numbers drop a lot as the sort of pandemic set in and such.
240.40s:  So again, I think we're going to start to see inflation slow down significantly. I think this
246.72s:  was probably the highest print. That's what the people who I respect the most in economics are
252.32s:  saying. And I think that's probably what the Fed thinks. I would say that there's an economist
260.24s:  Claudia Sam, who I find to have great analysis. She worked at the Fed for a long time. She's very
267.28s:  active on Twitter and I find her analysis to be some of the more compelling analysis out there. So,
273.36s:  you know, I'm kind of just talking about a lot of the things that she's been talking about. But
279.84s:  I, you know, from her perspective, she thinks that the Fed is looking at all this very closely,
285.04s:  that they're not going to overreact. A lot of people are saying, let's have an emergency meeting
289.68s:  next week. Let's get a rate hike fast. I will say that I find it surprising that they're not
297.04s:  stopping asset purchases, right? Like there's another 20 billion for this month and they haven't
302.56s:  signaled that they're stopping that. If I was, you know, in their shoes, which I'm obviously not,
309.04s:  I would have assumed by now that would have ended maybe before they had indicated it would end
316.24s:  at the very least. Because yeah, I agree that there's a rate hike coming. That should be no
320.48s:  surprise. Everyone seems to agree on that. There's a big question on how much and how many.
325.20s:  She thinks it's 25 basis points. You know, some people think 50 will be the first one.
330.48s:  I don't know what the answer is. I don't know how markets are going to react because you're right.
335.52s:  We're, this is unprecedented. We are in an unprecedented situation, unprecedented conditions.
342.16s:  Markets are getting a bit more volatile teams. We're seeing some, you know, they're kind of
347.76s:  see-solving now. We're seeing tech names really sell off when they have bad news.
353.92s:  So, you know, all that is indicative to me that we're potentially going through sort of a
362.00s:  regime change in markets, right? It's sort of the bad news, good news or is bad news, bad news.
367.28s:  And then it's starting to become the bad news. Now bad news get. And that's a big difference
373.04s:  that you see generally more in a bear market than a bull market. But, you know, it, I've been wrong
380.16s:  about that before for sure. And so, you know, it's, I think, I think people that are forecasting
385.84s:  right now, I find that, I find it hard to trust almost anyone. I don't think anyone really knows
391.84s:  what's going to happen over, you know, and what's going to unfold as the Fed tries to, to, you know,
398.24s:  end asset purchases and emerge from zero-in-stripe policy. It's going to be fascinating. That's for sure.
405.60s:  Yeah, I'm still riveting. It's just seeing what happens here. It's just a riveting story.
413.04s:  And it's like we were talking about last time, right? Like we really have no idea how this ends,
417.52s:  how the market reacts. I mean, I've been blown away with how the markets looked right now in light of,
423.76s:  you know, kind of the Fed tightening discussions. There's the whole Ukraine, Russia thing going on.
429.84s:  And the market is like surprisingly not dropping. You know, it's very interesting to me how,
441.92s:  anytime you think you might be able to identify how the market might react to things. And then it just,
448.32s:  market is closed. And it's up a little bit. See, like that, I just don't get that.
453.12s:  Right. And I mean, you know, this is like 24 hours where almost all the talk has been about a
458.24s:  potential war that's starting. And the kind of sanctions that would be levied on Russia in the midst
464.80s:  of that, you know, I am watching oil pretty closely. Yeah, it's near highs. Yeah, what, three
472.88s:  or five-year highs? Right. And that's going to be driving, you know, that does help to drive inflation.
477.68s:  But it also has a pretty big impact, you know, economic, broad economic impact. And, you know,
484.56s:  if Russia does invade and the US levies, intense sanctions, and so does the world, and the price of oil
490.08s:  really spikes, you know, that might be the thing that kind of cuts the market off at the knees.
497.44s:  Yeah, I think something I've been considering a lot too is if things with Russia, you know,
504.64s:  why they started pulling back some of the troops off the border. So a lot of people thought that
508.88s:  was kind of a, you know, a dovish sentiment that they might be trying to reconcile peacefully. I
513.84s:  think that was kind of part of what we saw in the market yesterday. But what I find to be even
519.12s:  more interesting is as NATO is starting to kind of do the rallying call and get everybody aligned,
527.20s:  I think it puts China in a fascinating position. And to me, that's really something that would
533.52s:  just absolutely drop the hammer on just the economy in general right now is if China started
539.44s:  to side more with Russia, if Russia was making its movements, you know, just in opposition,
545.12s:  essentially, the Western powers and whatnot, obviously all conjecture, nobody knows. But I do think,
550.40s:  you know, we see China's name starting to get involved. I can't think of many places where our
555.36s:  economies are more intimately intertwined. And, you know, relationships with them start deteriorating
562.80s:  further. I can only imagine what that looks like. I agree. And, you know, I think it's like this,
568.64s:  it is a situation at the very least of kind of mutually assured destruction, right? Like China holds
574.72s:  so many, so much of our debt that, you know, a problem for us is certainly a problem for them. And
581.12s:  it might be the only thing that it keeps things sane because I think you're right that China is
588.48s:  the thing to watch. And it's the thing that I think everyone around the world is trying to
595.28s:  separate from. And that's, you know, practically impossible. I think there are, you know,
604.32s:  sort of the greatest geopolitical rival that we face. And, you know, certainly economic
609.60s:  rival. And it's only going to get worse. So, you know, I think from that perspective,
616.32s:  they've got a lot of levers that they could pull that would be extremely bad for us. But,
622.32s:  like I said, in doing that, they would be cutting off the nose despite the face because, you know,
627.28s:  they've got just as many entanglements into our economy as we have into theirs.
632.48s:  Yeah, that's, and yeah, that's, it's just another one of those. The further you look at it,
637.04s:  I mean, obviously from like the geopolitical power side of things, there's one perspective.
643.68s:  But then once you start understanding how the economies are so, so intertwined and dependent
650.32s:  on one another. Because a lot of people I think in the US, understandably, we see, you know, a lot
655.12s:  of things made in China around the house. And a lot of people kind of just assume that that means
659.68s:  China, it has a just overall dominant economy that's overwhelmed the US. I think obviously, there's
666.72s:  more to that story, especially once you start looking further at GDP and the kind of products that
671.20s:  are moving and the level of technology that's being sold externally and things like that, that,
676.80s:  you know, there's a disparity there that I don't think is as commonly known. But I just feel like
682.96s:  the relationship between the two countries is just that if one starts doing any sort of
690.88s:  significant sanctions opposed to the other, I just see it going downhill very fast right after that.
697.04s:  I think so too. And, you know, I think it's a huge priority in the US to decouple from China.
701.92s:  And I think that that should be something that people pay way more attention to and that we pour
707.20s:  way more resources into. I think one of our greatest sort of political failings is not making that
712.48s:  one of the top issues in the country. And so, you know, I think if we could, from sort of a
719.28s:  supply chain perspective and a manufacturing perspective decouple far more so from China,
725.52s:  we would be in a much greater position because it would be worse for them as significant holders of
731.52s:  our debt. Right. And it would be for us. Yep. If anything, go down. That's a really good point.
739.20s:  So there was a couple of things that you brought up earlier that I wanted to make sure I circled
742.80s:  back to one of which was some of your economic, your favorite economic sources of information on
748.16s:  Twitter. I would be remiss if I didn't get a list of some of those people. I know that you're
752.00s:  already mentioned Claudia. Do you have anybody else that you would recommend, you know, if people just
758.08s:  want to follow broader scale economics a little closer, anybody else that you'd recommend?
764.48s:  It's funny. Yeah, I follow people from sort of all across the spectrum. You know, I wouldn't
776.08s:  necessarily endorse a lot of them, Chris. Sure. But I really find that getting other perspectives
783.20s:  is worthwhile. You know, like Matt Stoller as an example, who is someone who really focuses on
791.04s:  monopoly and corporate concentration. I find a lot of his analysis to be absolutely fascinating,
798.48s:  extremely in depth and well supported. If you're not a liberal, you might not like him. He's very
805.36s:  left. The same thing is someone called Noah Smith, who you know, is very liberal. But I find him to be
816.32s:  pretty measured when it comes to economic analysis. So, you know, I think of the top of my head,
826.16s:  you know, that's most of what I tend to see in my stream. You know, there's Rohan Gray is another
835.36s:  another pretty good one who's he's very much focused more on sort of, you know, like tech and
842.48s:  digital currency issues. But you know, a lot of these, a lot of these people are, I, what I really like
851.04s:  what is one to read some of these analysis of modern monetary theory and even in that left leaning
857.12s:  group, you get sort of a very diverse set of perspectives and opinions on modern monetary theory,
868.72s:  which is essentially like what we've been trying as a response to the pandemic. And for many of them,
875.60s:  you know, they, they, I mean, you get, you get both perspectives, but Claudia, I think, for example,
880.88s:  would consider this to be a triumph of modern monetary theory. And, you know, a demonstration that
888.40s:  you can really kind of print your way out of a crisis without huge repercussions. And, you know,
895.68s:  people might say, well, what about the inflation? But, you know, the the inflation that we're seeing,
901.44s:  again, if it ends up being transitory is sort of an expected outcome of a,
908.16s:  you know, sort of like a, it's more of a supply chain issue than a monetary policy.
917.28s:  Quick, quick question on that. Sorry. Just for the the transitory component, I am curious, because
924.32s:  but like last time we talked about it, I was doing actually a bunch of research to try to get some
929.36s:  ideas in terms of like what transitory inflation actually looks like. And I feel like that's just
936.32s:  another area where people like me might have a really skewed perspective without looking at
944.16s:  like a broader picture, right? Because I've been like said, I've been trading since like 2007.
949.68s:  So my exposure to inflation is relatively small, right? Compared to just longer market durations
957.28s:  and whatnot. So I would be really curious just to understand when you think of transitory inflation,
963.52s:  like what are some of the defining features of that for you as you have a conversation about,
969.52s:  except I feel like a lot of people look at inflation right now and they're like, well, it's not
972.96s:  transitory. It's been here for two months. You know what I mean? Like they kind of think it's been
976.16s:  here for a few months or even three quarters, right? Right. You know, yeah, you know, I think that
982.24s:  the way that it's been described to me is that it's a question of is it supply side inflation?
990.40s:  Is it being driven by supply side or demand side? If it's driven by demand side, it's potentially
997.92s:  more structural because that means it's being fed by, let's say, wage inflation and inflation
1005.92s:  expectations. Whereas if it's being driven by the supply side, it's because suddenly like we're
1012.64s:  seeing supply chains have become constricted and tight and materials are hard to get. And so what
1019.60s:  happens is that then yes, prices rise, but actions are taken because of those higher prices
1027.36s:  to streamline and improve the supply side. And so it comes back to normal. So I think the way
1033.12s:  Claudia put it was, it's like an inflation impulse, right? It's like, it's an impulse that hits.
1039.04s:  And it can be over a couple of quarters. It's not the kind of like when you say transitory,
1044.00s:  it doesn't mean like it's going to be a one month reading of high inflation and then gone, right?
1049.04s:  It's going to be a curve that goes up and then comes back down. And so that's what we would expect
1055.28s:  over the next few months is that hopefully we're at the peak and we start to see at least level off
1062.16s:  and then start to come back down. And so then we would look back at a couple of years and we would
1066.24s:  say, oh yeah, inflation was elevated for two or three quarters. And that and or even a year,
1074.40s:  let's say because the supply chains were completely screwed up. And like, given what's happened with
1083.84s:  COVID and people not being able to go to work and then the weird sort of hoarding behaviors that
1093.60s:  we saw, we really put our supply chains under this intense level of stress that I don't think
1100.88s:  anyone had ever sort of contemplated before. And now, yeah, we all have like a lifetime supply
1110.00s:  of toilet paper and paper towels. You know, we can't get ships to dock in the imports of LA
1116.72s:  fast enough, right? So all this stuff is a very weird situation that we find ourselves in.
1123.36s:  But you know, it's transitory. It means things are going to normalize again, right?
1127.84s:  So it's so two things. The first one is you are like the perfect match for like the stereotypical
1134.64s:  nice Canadian people because the way you phrased the awkward hoarding behavior, to me, I'm thinking
1141.92s:  just how psychotic human beings can be and completely nonsensical. Because it's like, I don't know,
1147.84s:  like I get it toilet paper is nice. I get it. But I guess for a lot of people, they don't realize
1153.04s:  like a good portion of the world goes without it. And I was worried about it's going to be like
1159.60s:  water. That's just, you know, the typical American, they're like, well, I'll worry about food later.
1167.92s:  Let me get this toilet paper. But the other thing that I'm actually really glad
1173.76s:  night and I appreciate that explanation because that really falls in line with a lot of what I
1179.60s:  was reading more in more or less in terms of inflation being transitory is not directly tied to
1185.52s:  duration. And I think that a lot of people immediately feel if it's, you know, here for
1193.04s:  experience of time, especially people like me write millennials and it's even worse for younger
1197.84s:  people where our attention span is like 14 seconds. So if something's been here for a day, it's
1203.68s:  essentially there for eternity, you know, and yeah, that's a really good point. And you know,
1210.32s:  I think a good, maybe a good example and this is off the top of my head. So it might not,
1217.12s:  you know, I'd probably have to look deeper into this. But if you think of sort of the stagflationary
1222.08s:  period of the 70s and early 80s, that's an excellent example of non-transitory inflation. So
1231.84s:  OPEC comes together to collude with about on oil prices and keep them elevated for an extended
1238.16s:  period of time and not to reflect supply demand equilibrium as well as economic growth slowing down.
1244.88s:  And, you know, suddenly you had consistent, extremely high inflation that, you know,
1252.08s:  there are certainly multiple narratives about how it was dealt with. But one of those narratives is
1257.04s:  that vulgar, you know, spiked interest rates essentially torpedoed the economy, but got inflation
1264.08s:  under control. I think there are other sort of revisionist history theories as to what might
1271.04s:  have been more effective. And so I don't want to speak to that or endorse a view of it. I'm only
1276.16s:  bringing it up to say that that's sort of the example of inflation that you would not consider
1281.28s:  transitory and in which action and significant action was needed in order to address it. And so
1289.92s:  I don't think that's the case today. I think you already see Congress tightening from a
1296.96s:  fiscal policy perspective. Right inflation can be driven by monetary policy, fiscal policy,
1302.00s:  or supply demand conditions. And, you know, if Congress is not going to pass like universal
1308.80s:  basic income or another massive social spending program, you know, that's going to be a fiscal
1316.00s:  force for tightening. And you've got the Fed as a monetary source, which will be tightening. And so
1324.00s:  it's, you know, to me, I think it's good that we can hope hopefully that the Fed will not overreact
1330.88s:  and that will ease into this tightening cycle. And, you know, if Powell can pull it off, it'll be
1336.16s:  really just an amazing success story of a massive disruption and dislocation to our economy
1344.08s:  and our world and one in which, you know, the Fed responded, managed through it over, you know,
1350.72s:  frankly over multiple decades of crisis after crisis and maybe we're about to come out of it.
1356.96s:  What do you say or what's your opinion, I should say, on all of the Bitcoin fanatics that say,
1366.16s:  all of this government manipulation is cured by Bitcoin. What do you think about that?
1378.80s:  I'm not. So the reason I am not a retired Bitcoin multi-millionaire is because I don't believe that.
1389.20s:  You know, I own a whole lot of Bitcoin as early as one.
1396.24s:  Oh, that's right. We talked about that. You have both made the same mistake, man.
1399.60s:  Yeah. I bought it at $2. But I was never a true believer. I was a trader and I traded out of it.
1407.44s:  And I have friends that were true believers and, you know, they can do whatever they want now because
1411.68s:  they're filthy rich. So, but most of those people though, they'll just keep holding it anyways.
1416.40s:  You know, somebody will never convert it to fiat. Yeah. I got 15 million in there,
1422.96s:  but it's going to keep going. That's right. They will never pay taxes on that. You could kill them
1428.32s:  before they're going to pay tax to the government. So, you know, I'm not a Bitcoin maximalist.
1435.68s:  I'm not a libertarian. I love crypto. I think it's amazing technology. I think that it's got a
1441.60s:  place in our economy and our market. But it does Bitcoin fix this so far not so far. It has not
1452.00s:  been proven to be an effective inflation hedge. So, you know, it's sort of like we're at the point
1461.20s:  where the proofs and the point is, right? Like if it is going to fix this and address it,
1465.60s:  it should be doing that. It should be going up as inflation goes up, which it hasn't,
1470.88s:  because it's just a very volatile sort of asset class. And, you know, I don't know, maybe 10,
1478.00s:  20 years from now, it'll be more stable and it will respond in the way they expect. But I think
1483.20s:  that's pure conjecture. I think so too. The other thing that I think about is if the idea of Bitcoin
1488.40s:  is that it's like a universal currency, right? It's borderless. Inflation changes in different
1495.68s:  countries at different points in time. So, like, what happens with that? So, yeah, I largely agree
1503.84s:  that there is a place for Bitcoin. I think it's just a really, really fast. I have Bitcoin right now.
1508.40s:  Like, I'm just fascinated by it. I think that it has potential in certain ways. But I've always been
1513.76s:  skeptical by, you know, the really, really Bitcoin evangelists that are essentially saying,
1521.04s:  if you have cancer, go get Bitcoin and now you're good. I'm a good friend who is one of those.
1529.44s:  And, you know, more power to him. He's done pretty well thanks to it. Just tell him to sell.
1539.28s:  And I think there's always, I like the saying, don't ever confuse luck with skill.
1546.32s:  And, you know, I think that we'll see. And I do think that Bitcoin will be an excellent investment
1553.92s:  over the long haul. And I've got some substantial exposure to different cryptos.
1560.56s:  And, you know, some real strong thoughts on where my money is going, which is, you know,
1566.16s:  I'm not putting new money into Bitcoin. I put it mostly into Avalanche. I think Avalanche is a far.
1572.08s:  You can't remember you tell me about technology. And, you know, I'm I tend to approach things from
1576.88s:  a tech perspective more than sort of a, you know, monetary structure person.
1585.04s:  Probably one. Actually, I don't know if anyone knows what this EFF shirt is, but they are a
1592.96s:  non-profit that is standing up for you and your rights to digital online security and privacy.
1598.72s:  They're safeguarding. Oh, technologies from government interference. And they are a non-profit
1604.64s:  that I'm a strong supporter of. And us nerds have to band together and hold the line.
1609.44s:  Speaking of nerds doing the right thing, did you see the news about Google? They're starting to
1615.20s:  potentially re. I didn't read the article away through. So I'm probably coming off is 95% ignorant,
1621.92s:  you know, 5% surplus than my usual. But I am it was talking about essentially some
1628.88s:  user rights adjustments to their current policies. Again, it's very broad, but they were comparing it
1635.44s:  to kind of like what Facebook did with, I'm sorry, what Apple did with some of, you know,
1639.76s:  like the privacy standards within the marketplace, you know, for like their app store and whatnot.
1644.08s:  Have you seen any of that yet? It was literally today. So you might not have.
1647.44s:  I did not see it today. It's probably the perfect segment and talking about the algorithmic
1651.52s:  accountability act. Hey, I would not trust Google. There it is.
1658.80s:  Okay, there you go. Yeah. So for just a couple of minutes, I wanted to pull up some
1665.68s:  tweets that Dave made mostly because I like looking at his profile picture. It's very dapper,
1670.72s:  I must say. A much younger Dave. Yeah. But one of the, you should see any of like my professional
1679.12s:  photos. It's when I was still clean shaven. I don't have a beard in any of them. So I am like the
1683.92s:  ultimate professional catfish because as soon as somebody sees me after they look at my LinkedIn
1689.52s:  channel, they're like, who the hell is this guy? But anyways, this actually was one of the things I
1695.20s:  really wanted to talk to you about was the algorithmic accountability act, which I was saying,
1699.36s:  I never heard about that before you kind of like that sweatshirt you're wearing, which I'm
1702.64s:  going to check them out afterwards. You're always full of fun things to check out. So anyways,
1706.56s:  you know, I'd love to hear just a little bit more about what you find interesting about the
1711.36s:  algorithmic accountability act. Yeah. So for the last couple of years, I've been involved in the AI
1719.44s:  space. And I actually, I sit on the editorial board for the Journal of AI and Ethics. And
1726.32s:  you know, the ethical use of AI is something I care very deeply about. And the misuse of personal
1733.12s:  data is also something that I care very deeply about. And it's why everybody who is listening to
1739.04s:  this should delete their Facebook account right now. What Facebook has done is horrific. We've
1745.68s:  destroyed civil society all in the name of it. And they've set us against each other. And I think
1754.00s:  that they have no ethics for more whatsoever. I got it. I'm sorry. I got to ask though. What are
1759.92s:  like some of the things you're referring to like bundled into that statement? Okay. So I wrote a
1767.60s:  piece on this. Good. In the journal, it was an editorial. And in it, you know, I explained that
1777.12s:  you know, Facebook claims to be about building community and bringing people closer together. But
1782.08s:  what they really do is they have algorithms that separate us into filter bubbles. And so they
1787.28s:  control the information that we see. And these algorithms are engineered to maximize engagement.
1794.16s:  And to maximize engagement, you need to make people angry and outraged. And that is the core of
1799.76s:  this outrage machine. And that is the entire business model of Facebook. I had an interaction with
1806.96s:  Facebook's chief AI scientist. Oh, pretty much just exactly a year ago on Twitter. And he said that I
1815.20s:  had no idea what I was talking about. And that Facebook's AI solves hate speech that it solves
1821.12s:  calls violence and bullying. And it is able to effectively filter out this information that
1826.64s:  invangers public safety or the integrity of the democratic process. So I'll wait while everybody
1833.12s:  stops laughing. Yeah. That just takes it sounds right up the rally. It sounds like it's a liar.
1839.52s:  What an absurd thing to claim that you're AI can do. And so instead of responding to him on Twitter,
1848.48s:  I wrote this really extensive piece in the journal of AI ethics with a really extensive
1854.08s:  amount of information and study to show how bad their algorithms are, how they do cost polarization
1861.04s:  and echo chambers. And to show that it is part of their business. Their business is to get us
1869.28s:  angry and to make us hate each other. It makes sense too. Because if you think about, oh, I'm sorry.
1874.96s:  I mean, it just popped in my mind like most of these TV shows on Netflix and stuff, a lot of them
1881.36s:  are driven just by drama. People love drama. So it does not surprise me in any way what you're saying
1887.60s:  that a social media platform is applying a similar construct. Yes, that's right. Exactly. And
1894.48s:  they have supported genocide. They have supported governments acting against their own citizens.
1902.96s:  They have made cyber bullying worse. And they have made us all dumber. And they have made it so
1911.36s:  that the information we believe is completely divorced from reality. And so the Alarmic Accountability
1919.12s:  Act is an attempt to start to put some guardrails on algorithms that impact people significantly.
1927.12s:  And that would apply to Facebook. That would apply to Google search engines that would apply to
1931.68s:  Twitter recommendation algorithms. Any of these systems that are algorithmically controlling what we
1939.60s:  see and recommending what we look at would need to have at the very least impact assessments being done
1948.32s:  to understand what the impact of those algorithms are and what changes to those algorithms would
1954.48s:  entail. And it's just like the barest minimum of accountability. But it's the first step towards
1961.68s:  actually regulating these that I think we as a society desperately need. I have two phone
1967.20s:  questions. The first one is your papers, they're like openly accessible or is there like a paywall for it?
1975.20s:  No, no, it's yeah, it is open access. And I'd be happy to send the link along if you want,
1980.32s:  you can link to it. Yeah, I would love to because I mean one, I want to read it, but then two,
1984.48s:  I think it'd be really cool for other people to check it out. So thank you.
1987.52s:  The other thing I wanted to ask you is I am generally confused as to how to perceive things like
1999.44s:  Facebook that are opt in. Like how much regulation should something be subjected to that's an opt-in
2008.16s:  service. You're not forced to use Facebook. You can easily choose not to. So I'm what like where
2014.24s:  does this go when we start seeing more, you know, broader government regulation on these private
2020.64s:  opt-in entities. I agree with the sentiment to be, you know, abundantly clear. I think the misuse
2025.44s:  and mischaracterization of information really needs to be addressed. But I am just curious like what
2029.36s:  the broader impact in the deeper game is here because government regulation also has its shortfalls.
2035.36s:  Totally agree. And it's a very fair question. And sometimes I do feel like I come off like a
2041.20s:  liberal and I'm first of all most certainly not. And I don't believe the government regulation
2047.12s:  is the answer to everything more often anything. That being said, I do believe that
2056.48s:  corporate concentration of power and monopoly is a problem. And Facebook is a monopoly. And not
2063.92s:  only are they a monopoly within social media, but they are allowed to acquire something like
2069.52s:  Instagram or something like WhatsApp. And so they can extend their monopoly power across
2074.40s:  different verticals. And that's where things get even more problematic. So when you talk about
2080.16s:  regulating Facebook as a monopoly, you want to reduce their economic power. And it's much of the
2086.40s:  same thing that I talk about in markets and market structure is that we want to address corporate
2092.16s:  concentration of power. We want to get rid of monopolies and foster competition. And I'm a very
2099.44s:  staunch believer that well-regulated competitive systems are the best outcomes that we know of
2106.80s:  economically. And so I would say that it is a problem when existing regulation allows firms like
2115.92s:  Facebook to acquire the kind of economic power that they have. So it's not necessarily a question
2123.52s:  of do we add on more regulation? It's often a question of can we change existing regulations that
2131.44s:  were probably written by the companies that have benefited the most from them to be better structured
2138.48s:  to foster competition? And that's where I tend to fall on these kinds of things.
2142.96s:  Got it. I love it. And that makes a lot of sense. I appreciate the clarification.
2147.52s:  So we got about 15 minutes left. So I would have to start throwing some rapid fire tweets at you.
2156.56s:  So this one it says, imagine that brokers, oh, okay, let me not do, let me not give you a bad read
2162.64s:  here. That was a bad read. It's supposed to be more like I think. Imagine that brokers, right?
2169.12s:  Yes. Brokers routing for their own benefit rather than their customers results in worse execution
2176.64s:  quality. Who would have seen that comment and so on and so forth. So I'm curious, you know,
2182.00s:  you were retweeting a Dutch market study. And that in and of itself, I find interesting. I always
2189.44s:  find like studies from other countries interesting because I always think that there's correlation,
2196.00s:  but obviously there's, you know, it's not a direct carryover. But I think in this instance,
2201.36s:  it's kind of direct carryover just for, you know, brokers. But anyways, yeah, just talking a little
2207.44s:  bit about this tweet, you know, we've talked a little bit about brokers routing before, but I'd love
2213.04s:  to get your broader thoughts on, you know, the competition improving outcomes concept of this and
2219.28s:  so on and so forth. Yeah, that's right. So, you know, I think that this year is going to be a really
2224.80s:  transformative year in market structure. And one of the most, one of the sort of central issues
2232.00s:  that is going to be confronted by the securities and exchange commission is this idea of what are
2237.76s:  called order routing inducements. And so when a broker gets an order from a retail investor or
2244.16s:  trader or even from an institutional investor, they have the duty of best execution. And that
2249.60s:  duty means that they have to get the best possible price given the circumstances of the market at
2256.48s:  the time. And also that they're allowed to consider other things, not just price. They can consider
2262.08s:  size, they can consider, you know, various different metrics, but as far as retail traders and
2271.28s:  investors go, the general metric that they're held to is price. And so the question is, are brokers
2278.80s:  routing orders to achieve the aims of best execution or are brokers routing orders to make more
2285.68s:  money for themselves through these inducements and those inducements include payment for order flow,
2291.44s:  which the wholesalers like Citadel and Virtu pay to retail brokers like Robinhood and Schwab and TD
2298.96s:  in order to get all those orders into their internal systems, execute against them, trade against
2305.76s:  them and not expose them to the market at large. And the proponents of payment for order flow
2312.24s:  will continually make this argument that retail has never had it better. They're getting the best
2316.40s:  possible prices. And they don't touch it. And the SEC is coming and they want to touch it. They
2322.32s:  want to get rid of it much like other countries have done. Europe is considering exactly the same
2328.80s:  thing. They don't have as much of a payment for order flow problem as the US does, but it is still
2335.60s:  something that they're considering outlying in Europe as well. And so this Dutch study was
2340.48s:  commissioned for those purposes because you are wanted to see our investors getting the best possible
2346.72s:  price. And the answer was no. And this is not a surprise. This has been shown before
2351.60s:  through all sorts of different studies in the US. And in fact, even this one retail broker public
2358.32s:  dot com came out with a really interesting piece in last year showing that even under the existing
2364.56s:  system, they're able to get better prices for their customers when they don't route to these
2368.96s:  payment for order flow internalizers. And so I think that this issue is going to be front and
2374.32s:  center, especially over the next month or so. I think March is there's going to be a lot of
2380.16s:  attention on this in all sorts of ways. And I think the SEC is about to come in and say we want to
2385.92s:  we want to end this practice. And then I think at that point, it's going to kick off this battle
2391.52s:  between the internalizers and the retail brokers on one side and everyone else involved in markets
2398.40s:  on the other side. And if you know, good luck finding somebody who supports the practice,
2404.72s:  who isn't either making money from it or who didn't make their money and their wealth from it in
2409.44s:  the past. I personally, I think it's important to note, it doesn't matter. This issue has no
2418.08s:  commercial interest for me whatsoever. I'm not going to make money one way or the other on how
2423.84s:  this issue has decided. But I've been are doing it's practice for 11 years now because I think it's
2431.04s:  bad for markets, it's bad for institutions. And most of our wealth is in institutions,
2437.68s:  such as mutual funds and pension plans and that kind of thing. And you know, the market,
2442.96s:  I believe needs to work better for institutions. And this would be a way to do that.
2449.04s:  It's interesting you say that because I think for a lot of retail traders, the narrative,
2454.80s:  it's exactly as you say, right? Where it may not be the best order flow, but it's better,
2461.52s:  you know, than what they've seen before. So what do you see if the changes are made, you know,
2469.20s:  that essentially start reducing him and for order flow and things like that? What from a retail
2474.96s:  trader perspective, what changes do you think trickle down to them? I think outcomes will improve
2481.20s:  significantly. And I think it's a very simple straightforward argument, right? What is going to be
2487.04s:  a better outcome when three firms are competing to give you the best price or when a thousand firms
2495.44s:  are competing to give you the best price? Right. How much simpler can you get?
2504.88s:  If you believe in capitalism and competition, then you're going to say a thousand firms,
2509.36s:  right? And that's what I push for. I push for open competition for order flow. That retail
2514.56s:  orders should go to a venue to a transparent venue where anyone in the market compete over them.
2522.80s:  And you know what? If Citadel and Virtue are still providing the best possible prices, they will
2528.48s:  there too. It's beautiful in that way, right? But you know what? They'll have to face competition
2534.00s:  from all these other firms. And they're not going to be able to put all of that in order off for it.
2537.60s:  Yeah. The other side of it is that there was a good study that was done that measured something
2544.24s:  called toxicity on exchange. And it said, and you know, unless you want to get deep into the issue,
2549.92s:  the thing you need to know is that the orders from retail are not toxic. They are good to trade
2559.52s:  against. They're easier to make money for market makers. And so by pushing those orders onto a
2567.12s:  transparent venue, you would reduce the toxicity of that venue. And by reducing the toxicity of
2575.04s:  our lit markets, our exchanges in the US, you would tighten spreads by 25% or more. That's why.
2584.00s:  What that tells you, yes, what that tells you is that payment for order flow is increasing the costs
2590.56s:  to trade for everyone in the market by 25%. That's a huge number. And that's the kind of number
2597.36s:  that's eroding returns for pension plans that's adding to fees and mutual funds. And that retail
2603.12s:  traders and investors are facing too. So, you know, I do believe strongly that you get all those
2608.32s:  orders into a transparent venue and everybody's outcomes would be far better except maybe for
2614.00s:  Citadel and Vertu and the retail brokers. Do you do you think that the change will happen? Like,
2620.08s:  do you think it's gaining enough traction to see the adjustment made or? I think the proposal is
2626.64s:  going to be made. And then I think it's going to be up to the people that support it to be very
2634.48s:  vocal in supporting it because the the the ones that will oppose it are going to be loud. They're
2641.68s:  going to be organized. They're very powerful interests. They're going to be donating to political
2646.96s:  campaigns. And they already have Ken Griff in the Citadel is the largest GOP donor in this cycle.
2654.80s:  And so, you know, that's what that's the the war that is essentially coming for market structure.
2661.20s:  But I mean, I'm very I'm very cautiously optimistic. It feels like finally, all of these issues
2667.36s:  are kind of coming to a head this year. And I think it's going to be a pretty big year for markets.
2673.36s:  Interesting. All right. So, we have another two we actually wanted to look at this one next. So,
2680.96s:  hopefully made it a little easier for you to see. We got about a little less than 10 minutes left.
2686.48s:  But for this one, it's a press release that you are highlighting from Paxis Global. And essentially,
2693.28s:  you know, the exciting part, it seems to kind of dovetail off of that conversation where we might
2698.96s:  start to see an increase in competition in kind of the clearing space. Does this follow similar
2706.72s:  logic to what you were kind of just outlining regarding order flow or how do you view this impact
2712.72s:  to the market? I think it's similar and a little different. So, again, yes, I'm just a believer in
2720.48s:  competition. And, you know, I have a traditional sort of capitalist education and background. And so,
2727.04s:  you know, that's that's where I'm going to come down on a lot of issues. But what I find so
2732.56s:  fascinating about Paxis, which I learned a lot about recently. And I learned a lot about their
2738.48s:  technology is that this is not centralized clearing and settled. So, today, you have the the NSCC
2747.52s:  and the DTCC and that's where trades are settled and cleared. And what's that those are centralized
2754.00s:  counterparts. And so, everyone on Wall Street has to face off against these centralized counter
2760.64s:  parties. And they have to have enough margin on hand and enough capital on hand to manage the
2766.56s:  settlement and clearing process for the entire industry. And having all of that capital and
2775.84s:  taking the time today, settlement is T plus two. We're going to be moving to T plus one in two
2780.80s:  years. But even there, having, you know, capital and time held up is a risk. And it's a risk that's
2788.48s:  sort of everybody in the industry faces at a cost that everybody in the industry faces. And
2795.04s:  what Paxis has done is they've created a blockchain based technology that essentially allows
2802.40s:  counter parties to face off against each other. And that decentralized model, I find very exciting.
2808.96s:  It's a part and parcel of, you know, what can blockchain technology do? And where does it make sense
2815.44s:  to use it versus let's say a database, for example? And this is one of those, I would say relatively
2822.72s:  a few examples of where blockchain actually makes sense. And where the tech is moving along. And,
2829.68s:  you know, so they got a no action letter from the SEC a couple years ago. They proved out that
2834.16s:  they could do this in equities trading and settlement. And, you know, now they have applied to be
2841.84s:  a registered clearing agency. And they would be the first new clearing agency in over 10 years,
2847.76s:  which is, I find that exciting. That's what I wanted to highlight actually. Like, this part is
2853.76s:  really what drew me to this tweet is exactly that. It's always an interesting indicator of what
2860.32s:  a current, you know, niche looks like when entry looks like that, where nobody has entered in a decade.
2867.84s:  And, you know, that is very, very interesting to me. So do you think that blockchain technology
2874.24s:  will give them at least space to compete in the current clearing space? Or like, would you say?
2880.80s:  Yeah, I think so. And I think what's even more interesting about the way that they have approached
2887.12s:  this is that they've done it under the current securities laws. And it's getting, it would get very
2894.72s:  deep in detail. I won't pretend to know as, as like an expert, you know, like the people at Paxos. But
2902.80s:  there are other attempts to do this, which would require rewriting securities laws.
2908.24s:  But the way that they have done this, it would not. And so to me, that's what's most compelling is
2914.08s:  that they can come in, fit within the current framework and build a better system that can
2921.36s:  better track securities, better track shares as potentially as they're shorted and lent out and
2928.40s:  delivered, as well as reducing the risk and cost in terms of time and capital required. So
2937.92s:  all of this strikes me as significant efficiencies that the industry could gain. And, you know, a lot
2944.08s:  of retail is very concerned around the opacity and what they perceive as the corruption of the current
2951.28s:  settlement and clearing agencies. And without coming down on any side of that issue, you know,
2958.08s:  this is the kind of thing that maybe will give a lot of people more confidence in the system. And
2963.44s:  I think that's important as well. Yeah, I think it's a beautiful summary, especially because
2969.52s:  when we talk about blockchain, a lot of people think, you know, immediately cryptocurrencies.
2973.92s:  But this is one of the things that I talk about with one of my friends who's in the space. He comes
2978.72s:  on the channel every once in a while and he often brings up the application of blockchain technology to
2984.16s:  other, you know, spheres to your point that might even make, I wouldn't say more sense, but
2989.44s:  equal to sense at least as, you know, some of the cryptocurrency arguments.
2993.92s:  Yeah. And crypto is, you know, when you talk cryptocurrencies, you're talking,
2998.08s:  usually talking about sort of permissionless, trustless distributed ledger technology,
3003.52s:  which are a lot of buzzwords. I know. But, you know, we don't have time to do a whole
3008.16s:  lesson on blockchain and let distributed ledger technology. But, you know, this is not that, in fact,
3014.48s:  this is a piece of blockchain technology, the smart contract piece, because you don't need a
3020.24s:  system here that's decent, that's distributed or trustless because the people that would be
3026.00s:  engaging are all regulated entities and, you know, you do, you, it needs to be permissioned.
3032.00s:  When you have this smart contract technology that can allow what are called atomic swaps,
3036.80s:  suddenly, you know, that is a real step forward. And so that's what I find to be so fascinating
3043.76s:  about what their approach has been. Yeah. I love it. The next tweet you have here, and it's the
3050.32s:  last one for this before kind of closing up. But I just wanted to let you know that I,
3056.56s:  vehemently disagree with this. I'll never be able to put another successful trade on if I can't
3061.84s:  simply copy Nancy Pelosi. So this is not only selfish of you, and it is devastating to the vast
3071.20s:  majority of the generators. I'm sorry. I could say. I just can't stay at corruption.
3082.40s:  And I mean, I just the detriment of your returns. This has been a hot butt night on for a long time.
3088.32s:  And I think something that you hit on that I truly love maybe equal to your beard. I don't know.
3098.08s:  I probably love you a little more. But it's the winter beard right now. So it's the thicker.
3103.76s:  Yeah. I mean, that's that's what I'm about. So, but it's where it says, you know,
3109.28s:  lawmakers and the families has the appearance of corruption. I love that because part of it,
3115.84s:  obviously, is everybody just immediately looks and are like, that's corruption. And you are giving
3121.60s:  a more, I think, rational perception of this, you know, not everybody in Congress is necessarily
3129.12s:  corrupt right out of the gate. You can argue that either way. But, you know, giving the benefit
3134.16s:  of the doubt, I like that you highlight the fact that even the appearance of corruption, which I
3141.36s:  agree with, is detrimental in and of itself. It's the same thing, you know, that we see in a private
3147.52s:  industry, you know, my wife, she works in big law. There's a lot of restrictions on, you know,
3155.28s:  especially people in that are partners and whatnot. There's all sorts of restrictions on all of them,
3161.12s:  not necessarily because of direct corruption, but this right here, the appearance of corruption.
3167.04s:  And you see it in a lot of places. So just talk to me a little bit about your thoughts on this,
3171.36s:  because I think a lot of people resonate other than me, like I said, I'm really going to be
3174.96s:  in big trouble coming up with trade after this. So, you know, I'm hoping this could stop and
3179.28s:  extract, but, you know, for other people that might be interested in equitable and, you know,
3185.68s:  buzzwords like that. What are your thoughts here? Look, I like that you've highlighted that.
3194.48s:  I certainly think it's corrupt. I think the corruption is staggering.
3200.40s:  My point in this is it doesn't even matter if it is if they're corrupt or not. This is
3206.64s:  enough. Just the appearance, just the appearance. So, you know, yeah, that's right. It gives them
3210.96s:  the benefit of the doubt. It doesn't matter. You can't, you want someone to change a system
3215.68s:  that they are, you know, you're depending on the people who benefit the most from the system to
3220.48s:  change it. And you're probably not going to get very far. But if you just yell at them in their
3226.00s:  faces and call them criminals, get them to see that it doesn't even matter if they are or not.
3231.76s:  If we don't trust our, you know, our leaders and we don't trust them to do the right thing and
3236.08s:  we don't trust them to enter public service because of, you know, that it's service versus a gateway
3243.20s:  to extreme wealth. That's that just attracts all the worst kind of people. And I find the
3249.92s:  response of politicians, especially who have profited so much from it. What do you mean?
3255.36s:  It's part of the American economy. Right. Right. You know, we're all, you know, we're all part of
3259.92s:  the market here or, you know, some have said, well, you won't attract people into Congress. If they
3267.52s:  can't trade off of that position, like, are you kidding me? Like, it's the craziest possible
3274.56s:  reaction. And all I can say is good. I don't want to attract those people, right? I want the people
3281.52s:  who are coming in because they want to serve and they want to try and fix things, even if I don't
3286.56s:  agree with their views, right? At least they're trying to do the right thing. And it's probably too
3293.36s:  much to hope for. It certainly has become in this day and age too much to hope for. But, you know,
3297.20s:  maybe we can aspire to get back to that. Well, for me, I actually like the fact that there's
3302.80s:  at least, you know, even some bills being introduced, you know, I'm sure some of it might just be kind
3307.52s:  of for a show. But like, I like that there's at least a conversation about it because, you know,
3314.96s:  as much as my annual P&L is going to suffer from this sort of, you know, just huge drop in my strategy,
3324.56s:  I think it really is important, especially because it's exactly as you say, nobody looks at this and
3330.80s:  whether or not they are actively engaging in corruption and somehow, you know, Nancy Pelosi's
3336.80s:  husband who's apparently a fucking genius because the dude's made several hundred million over
3341.76s:  the last couple of years. That's just really a track record. You know, I think that the appearance
3350.88s:  in and of itself is more than enough to go off of. We have really high expectations of the military
3358.40s:  in a lot of these senses. And it just blows my mind that it somehow doesn't permeate over to this
3366.32s:  group because, you know, apparently capitalism and the economy access applies to certain people
3374.00s:  and not others. Exactly. And, you know, it's just one of those things, it's a small thing,
3380.32s:  but a lot of these small things, I think, add up and they're important. Yes.
3383.52s:  Right. And if we want to get back to, you know, a governable country, which it feels like the US
3392.16s:  not really a governable country at the moment, you know, I think it starts with rooting out
3396.32s:  corruption and it starts with rooting out, you know, the revolving door and the influence of
3402.24s:  lobbying and, you know, political and campaign finance for all of these things are sort of part and
3408.96s:  parcel of the same issue, which is to try and get back to, you know, governing a country based
3416.00s:  on what's best versus what's best for the country versus what's best for the individuals that have,
3421.60s:  you know, attained higher office. And so, you know, I'm sure it's naively optimistic to hope
3426.80s:  we can get there, but, you know, I'll continue to be the naive optimist. Well, you know, don't worry,
3431.84s:  while you're doing that, as soon as this gets struck down and I no longer can put food in my mouth,
3436.08s:  I'll just send you a bill on a month ago. You just pick me up. You know, Pelosi might have a
3442.08s:  contract record, but most of these politicians actually don't. Yeah, I mean, it would be great to see
3449.68s:  this just changed, but cool. We're pretty much at time, but I definitely want to talk at least
3455.76s:  a couple minutes about your platform that's coming out. I am so stoked about it. And, you know,
3461.84s:  I've again, just full disclaimer. I did invest in it because I truly believe in it. I love what
3466.80s:  you guys are doing. But anyways, you know, just what's the latest there? I unfortunately wasn't able to
3471.68s:  make the town hall last night. I'm looking forward to that recording, but would love, you know, just a
3476.16s:  two-minute recap on what you guys are doing. Yeah, and of course, thank you for the support.
3480.80s:  You know, it means a lot. We just, we take it very seriously. We crowdfunded our funding for this,
3488.88s:  and you know, that gave us a base of investors of over 1,350. And it's an amazing sort of foundation
3497.44s:  to be building from. And so, you know, our intention is that in about a month, we're going to release
3504.16s:  an alpha version of it to our investors. And maybe four to six weeks after that, we will open up
3511.36s:  beta. And so on the web, on the website right now, Irvin.finance, you can sign up for the beta
3516.32s:  weight list. If you share your referral link, you can move up the beta weight list to get access
3521.04s:  earlier. And, you know, what we're going to have, even early on, we're just going to have fantastic
3527.04s:  data sets. The best data of the professional world, we have secured an excellent sort of commercial
3535.36s:  arrangement. So it's going to, we'll be starting out, it'll have delayed prices because there are
3541.76s:  processes we have to go through to get approval for showing real time. But ultimately, probably by
3547.76s:  beta, we will have those approvals. And so we will have the highest quality real-time data. We'll
3552.96s:  have historical intraday data going back seven years. We will have daily data that goes back to 1960.
3559.84s:  We will have the best sources of fundamental data and corporate intelligence available.
3565.36s:  We'll have the kind of real-time newsfeed that, you know, CNBC relies on and other trading desks. So,
3574.00s:  you know, from a real-time news perspective, we're investing heavily in that. So all of these data
3579.12s:  sources will be coming together to hopefully provide, you know, a fantastic research experience
3585.84s:  for people, a way to understand markets. And then what we hope to build on with that is sort of
3592.80s:  communities that come together to do due diligence and push out research and strategies. So we see
3600.48s:  it sort of coming together as a sub-stack for financial analysis. And then we're also going to have
3605.44s:  all sorts of educational resources to help teach people about markets, market structure, investing,
3611.28s:  trading, financial literacy. All of this stuff is a real focus of ours. And then the last piece is
3617.84s:  advocacy where we're really trying to be a force in this market structure debate that's going to
3622.80s:  be happening this year and beyond. And we're going to try and make sure that markets are going to work
3626.72s:  better for people and be simpler and more transparent. You guys are awesome. I'm literally super looking
3632.56s:  forward to it. And again, just for like the sake of pure transparency, like Dave didn't ask me
3637.12s:  to invest. There was literally nothing there. I asked him to look at the platform and I literally
3641.36s:  just liked it. Like there's no promotional agreement, anything like that. I just want all of that
3645.20s:  to be super clear because I really go out of my way to just, you know, be transparent with people
3650.96s:  because there's such a lack of that. But yeah, I'm literally so stoked about it. I can't wait to
3656.80s:  check it out. I think you guys are working on something that's really powerful. I had a chance,
3660.48s:  you know, to work off of a Bloomberg terminal for a while, which was a really great experience.
3666.00s:  And this seems something that retail traders will benefit from tremendously as well as,
3671.84s:  you know, probably larger groups as well. And the last thing I definitely want to know is
3676.40s:  one of the things that really sold me on you guys early on was kind of that community aspect
3680.80s:  because that's one of really my missions with the YouTube channel is to teach people how to
3686.08s:  learn to trade derivatives and options. Like I love teaching and I love the space. And one of
3691.60s:  the biggest components of that is teaching people to work together because the collective brain
3696.96s:  is way smarter than any student person. It's so cool, right? I love the hive mind. I'm blown away
3702.88s:  by the hive mind. And you know, I think that that that's our exact hope is that we can provide,
3708.64s:  you know, like a lot of this a lot of the hive mind analysis has come out on Reddit, for example,
3714.80s:  which is a fantastic system, but it's not built for that, you know, right? So we're going to have
3720.96s:  a system that is built for that where you can, you know, do a very powerful type of data visualization
3728.24s:  and analysis. And then you can take the product of that and embed it in a post, for example,
3735.36s:  and share that with people. Others can collaborate. They can, you know, check out what you're doing,
3740.16s:  change it, you know, offer revisions, communities can all be together to develop it. And then you
3744.80s:  can embed these things so that they continue to update, right? That they're not static illustrations
3749.84s:  of what you're trying to show that they're changing over time, as things change over time. So
3754.08s:  I just love the idea of building a platform to let people be creative and work together. And then
3760.08s:  I don't even know what's going to come out of it, but I know it's going to be really cool.
3764.00s:  Yeah, well, unlike the current, you know, waiting to see what happens with Fed policy, I think this
3768.24s:  one we're eager to see how this one pans out. So I agree with you. It's going to be something special.
3773.84s:  So thank you guys for working on that. And as always, they've absolute pleasure talking with you.
3778.16s:  Thank you for your time, and I'm looking forward to connecting with you again. Yeah, likewise. Thanks, Eric. It was fun. Take care.
