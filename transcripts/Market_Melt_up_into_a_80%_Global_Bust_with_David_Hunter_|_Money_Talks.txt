2.48s: what's going on everybody so
5.12s: we got my best friend david hunter back
8.64s: here again i say my best friend because
10.48s: every time i talk to you i learn a ton
12.96s: so first off welcome back i think this
15.28s: is your third time so it's great to have
16.80s: you again yeah thanks eric i'm glad to
19.12s: be glad to be back
21.28s: it's a pleasure so
22.80s: obviously the you know the last few
24.64s: times we spoke we
27.04s: got a ton of general market context from
30.24s: you just in terms of how you view things
32.40s: why you view them that way those sorts
34.72s: of things and i figured that today would
36.32s: be really um engaging to kind of follow
39.60s: along that same thought pattern that's
41.12s: actually one of my favorite parts that
42.96s: we've kept this fairly regimented you
45.20s: know every three or four months because
46.72s: you get to see
48.16s: how you perceive information as it rolls
50.64s: out and i think that's actually really
52.32s: informative for people it's like we were
54.08s: just talking about
55.52s: just about everybody on the internet
56.88s: wants the magic answer but unfortunately
59.60s: you know circumstances continually
61.28s: change so what i really value in these
63.52s: conversations is you
65.60s: sharing your experience with us and
67.28s: essentially teaching people how they can
69.36s: think about things and come to their own
71.28s: conclusions you know again leveraging
73.36s: your experience so i'm really looking
75.36s: forward to to chat with you so i figured
78.08s: a great first softball starter question
82.40s: is
83.44s: how do you think the fed is handling the
87.04s: current market
89.52s: yeah that's one that might take the rest
91.36s: of the the interview you know
94.08s: um
95.12s: it's a it's a mixed bag for sure um you
98.32s: know
99.04s: the feds got a tough job on their hands
102.08s: um
103.04s: we had inflation break out in the last
105.20s: year
106.08s: uh total levels we haven't seen in 40
108.64s: years
109.60s: um they
111.28s: uh kind of slow walked it initially and
114.08s: thought it was transitory so
116.24s: all of a sudden in january when it
117.84s: really started heating up
119.60s: they had to play catch-up and they've
120.96s: been playing catch-up ever since
123.12s: um
124.00s: you know i have probably a little bit
126.08s: different view than a lot of people and
128.16s: i've been a fed watcher for all of my 49
130.88s: year career and i've seen all the
133.84s: various um
135.60s: fed makeups you know through that time
137.60s: and fed chairman
139.60s: i and i've had a mixed review on powell
143.04s: over his career over his time here in
145.36s: the chair
146.40s: um you know back in
148.48s: in 2018 i was really critical of him he
151.20s: was fairly early on in that role
153.84s: and he made some blunders and you know
156.88s: the market
158.16s: um
159.20s: sold off because of some of that uh but
161.84s: more than that he just it was showing
164.08s: that it is an experience at that time
166.48s: um you know fast forward to march of
168.84s: 2020 and
170.56s: he stepped right up to the plate and did
172.32s: the job he had to do to to save the
174.64s: system when we're shutting down
176.64s: the entire economy
178.32s: um so i gave him plot it's for acting
180.80s: quickly and decisively
182.80s: uh you know you're not going to be
184.16s: perfect when you're in that kind of
185.76s: environment but he did a good job
188.08s: um and then now
190.16s: uh certainly these last few months
193.20s: i i fear he's he's doing what he has to
195.84s: do in terms of you can't ignore the
197.68s: inflation you've got to tighten so i
199.92s: agree with all that but some of his
202.08s: rhetoric and
204.48s: you know their kind of
206.48s: um long runway for tightening and things
210.00s: i think is showing that he does not
212.00s: really understand
214.00s: the
214.88s: magnitude of the risk that is out there
217.84s: uh i feel they are over tightening and
220.48s: frankly it's funny to say that because
222.00s: they really are
223.28s: you know they've only hiked a few times
226.08s: they're still way
228.32s: under what the market is in terms of
230.80s: market rates
232.08s: um but the market did the tightening for
234.48s: him and i'm not sure he understands that
237.20s: uh so there's there's you know some
239.36s: concerns there
241.44s: i do think they should
243.20s: pivot uh fairly soon
245.68s: um whether
247.28s: a pivot means just a pause in in the
249.60s: rate hikes
250.80s: after we get through july
252.88s: or whether he's gonna
254.64s: you know take longer to recognize the
256.72s: needs pause and the need to pivot
259.20s: uh it's hard to say
261.20s: but frankly i think the economy is
263.92s: rolling over there's a lot of things i
265.84s: look at
267.44s: it's not that you're going to see it
268.72s: immediately in the gdp number or
272.48s: you know every every economic
275.04s: data point that comes out is going to be
276.80s: negative
277.84s: but in general we're seeing the things
280.24s: that lead to a pretty sharp downturn
283.36s: and i'm not sure again
285.44s: the fed is doing enough forward looking
287.60s: i think they're so caught in looking at
289.44s: the present and looking backwards
292.24s: based on looking at data which is
294.08s: telling you what happened last month
296.48s: that i think they're gonna end up being
298.56s: as they
299.60s: almost always are
301.44s: uh late in recognizing the need to shift
304.64s: and so
306.08s: you know on that basis i'd say he's
308.72s: um you know he's back in my doghouse in
311.84s: terms of
312.96s: uh still learning on the job
317.36s: you live up to your continued reputation
320.24s: as a contrarian because i think you're
322.16s: the first person i truly have heard say
324.40s: that you're postulating that they might
326.16s: be over tightening at this point
328.08s: especially
329.20s: you know there's even more conversation
330.88s: about the next uh rate hike a while they
333.60s: were talking about 100 basis points then
335.60s: they said no that's a little too much
337.04s: maybe you know 75 basis points
340.08s: and it seems like your perspective is
341.60s: even that might be too much
344.24s: but i would be really curious to
345.76s: understand you also mentioned you know
348.48s: the that the market did some of the
351.44s: tightening essentially on the behalf of
353.44s: the fed
354.40s: so
355.20s: when we think about july and we think
358.08s: about you the next quarter what do you
361.12s: think should happen with rates and more
364.32s: importantly why do you think that
366.72s: yeah so first of all the the reason i
368.64s: say the bond market has done a lot of
370.64s: the tightening for the fed
372.64s: and did most of it prior to their first
375.44s: hike
376.64s: back in
378.08s: april
379.04s: is because you had a 200 basis point
382.16s: jump in rates in a very short period of
384.16s: time just a few months time
386.48s: uh so you went from you know extremely
389.04s: low rates to you know 200 base points up
391.68s: on on that low base was a huge jump
394.24s: historic jump right um that's already
397.36s: showing up in terms of housing is
399.20s: rolling over
400.56s: um it's showing up in terms of retail
403.52s: sales and and the inventory build that
405.84s: we're seeing in retail uh it's showing
408.96s: up in
410.32s: uh consumer confidence or consumer
412.32s: sentiment the michigan consumer
413.84s: sentiment is the lowest that series has
416.16s: ever been i think
417.76s: those are all signs that
420.00s: that even though it's still historically
422.88s: low rates
424.24s: when you have that magnitude of a change
426.72s: in a short time it's that rate of change
429.04s: in the rate
430.24s: that can have a dramatic end point of
432.48s: impact i mean simply put a mortgage rate
436.16s: that was
437.28s: you know two and three quarters is all
439.60s: of a sudden six percent
441.44s: right that's a huge change uh for home
444.16s: buyers and
445.44s: and it really shut down activity and
447.68s: maybe as important or maybe more
449.76s: important
450.80s: it shut down refi activities for a long
453.68s: time with rates so low
456.24s: uh there was
457.68s: the ability for
459.44s: homeowners to refi
461.68s: pull money out of their home and have
463.36s: spending power
464.88s: that didn't uh didn't mean they were
466.88s: building credit you know their credit
468.24s: card balance is up
470.00s: and and because their home prices were
472.00s: going up they said hey this is i'm just
473.84s: taking some of the equity out of my
475.20s: house to do things
476.96s: and now with rates where they are
480.80s: there's hardly any and probably no refi
484.00s: activity at all that's a huge uh huge
487.52s: um drain of liquidity that had
490.80s: previously helped the economy so
493.76s: those are the things i mean that and and
495.76s: then the other tightening
497.60s: really isn't the bond market it's it's
499.60s: the big run-up in gasoline prices and
502.48s: home eating oil prices so
504.64s: that that was another tax on consumers
507.76s: uh that really um
510.48s: you know the fed has to account for
512.56s: because
513.68s: it does take money out of the out of the
516.40s: consumer's pocket
518.00s: and money that might have otherwise gone
520.48s: to going out to dinner
522.40s: you know buying um you know
525.36s: new furniture what have you
527.68s: people saying i'm i'm just getting by
529.68s: i'm doing what i can to get by and
531.60s: frankly
532.80s: with the run-up and credit card balances
534.72s: of weight
536.00s: i think they're not even getting by
537.68s: they're fun they're finding they have to
539.68s: you know they've they've drained their
541.04s: savings savings is down at uh sharply
543.84s: lower levels and it was last couple of
545.44s: years
546.48s: and now they're turning to their credit
548.08s: cards
549.36s: because it's costing you know the cost
551.28s: of living's gone up so fast so
554.48s: while i understand the fed's focus on
557.12s: that cost of living and saying we gotta
558.80s: get inflation down it's hitting the
560.16s: consumer
561.36s: they also have to realize the other
563.12s: aspects of of what that cost living
566.40s: has done
567.68s: it's we're gonna see
569.60s: you know their whole goal is to
571.68s: um
573.12s: basically have demand destruction and
575.60s: bring inflation down that's the way the
578.08s: fed can control inflation or have any
580.16s: impact on inflation
582.08s: but they have to understand
584.80s: that you're going to see
586.80s: maybe a lot more demand destruction than
588.80s: you're counting on and by the time you
591.12s: see it
592.24s: if you wait for that
594.16s: you've gone way past the time when you
596.24s: can turn this thing back up and have a
598.16s: soft landing so that's that's the crux
600.64s: of the problem is i think
602.88s: the fed is at risk of creating a hard
605.60s: landing here
607.36s: because as i say
609.36s: they don't really understand the leads
611.28s: and lags to their policy
613.60s: when you see them operating on the basis
615.92s: of a consumer price index
618.48s: that
619.52s: um you know jumped up to nine percent
623.12s: uh last week or a couple weeks ago
625.76s: and they're
627.44s: making a determination on rates
630.08s: you know two weeks three weeks later
632.32s: based on that number
634.96s: they're they're operating on yesterday's
637.60s: news to determine
639.92s: uh policy for tomorrow's economy that's
643.28s: not the best way to go you really as an
645.68s: economist should be looking forward
648.00s: and i'm just not convinced
650.56s: that they do enough of that
653.28s: and just for a point of my own education
657.04s: so
657.84s: i guess i always presumed that when the
662.08s: fed released you know different metrics
665.84s: that they would have plenty of daily or
669.44s: even weekly
670.96s: you know interim internal updates
673.36s: leading into the actual release
675.68s: do they not have the tool kit to be able
678.48s: to kind of be more sensitive because as
680.48s: you rightly point out and i think it's
682.32s: important to know you know two things a
684.72s: lot of the indicators that they look at
686.32s: inherently are lagging but the other
689.04s: component is if they're looking at latin
691.12s: lagging indicators so intermittently it
693.68s: seems like they lose a ton of
694.80s: sensitivity when really
696.88s: obviously we all think they should gain
698.48s: more sensitivity to be more reactive in
700.32s: the current environment do they not just
702.00s: have that tool kit or like what what's
703.68s: the disconnect there leading to them
706.24s: not getting data quickly enough
708.56s: yeah well they have you know they have
710.16s: hundreds of economists feeding them data
712.96s: and those economists
714.88s: certainly are trained
716.56s: to look at leading indicators and
718.72s: understand you know how to forecast etc
722.64s: but i will say
724.56s: that what i see in this current fed
726.88s: makeup and again it's not that unique
729.68s: we've seen it in past fed regimes
733.68s: um they're they're really focused on
736.48s: headline news i mean you know when cpi
739.92s: gets so much attention on cnbc and
742.40s: bloomberg
743.68s: the fed can't help but say hey we got to
745.60s: pay attention to this too
747.60s: so it's it's not that they're not able
750.48s: you know that they're not being
751.52s: economists or not getting good economic
754.16s: data
755.20s: i just think their their bias is towards
758.48s: what's in the headlines and what's you
760.40s: know kind of currently
762.40s: in in uh you know at the forefront of
764.96s: the media
766.16s: and they're responding to that and i
768.24s: just
769.28s: some of that comes from maybe not being
771.68s: as market savvy a group
774.88s: been a criticism for years that
777.12s: the fed is more academic oriented you
779.68s: know you've got academics running it so
781.84s: they're not
782.96s: as tuned into maybe market factors that
785.68s: can be
786.64s: leading indicators you know personally i
788.72s: would like them to focus more on
791.28s: some of the things that are are
793.52s: early indicators that maybe it's time to
796.00s: think have we finished you know should
797.84s: we should we start looking the other way
799.76s: when lumber comes down from
802.16s: you know 17 lumber futures down from
804.32s: 1700 to 500
806.64s: and below 500 actually
809.20s: that's that's a sign
811.52s: that
812.32s: you know you've had a big impact on on
815.36s: housing you've had a big impact on
817.44s: construction
818.80s: when
819.76s: you know when used car sales
821.76s: prices are falling pretty dramatically
824.00s: it's a sign that maybe inventories you
826.48s: know we're finally getting the handle on
828.88s: new car inventories are getting back in
830.88s: line so that maybe
832.80s: um
833.84s: you know that's
835.36s: not in it
836.72s: you know maybe we need to realize that
838.88s: prices are going to come down
840.96s: as as that you know as that supplies
844.16s: change situation clears up
846.40s: um
847.20s: when you see a big jump in inventories
850.00s: at target and walmart and other
851.92s: retailers
853.36s: to the levels that we've seen that are
855.20s: way beyond anything that's precedent
858.72s: you you need to sit up and take notice
860.80s: of that and say gee because what a
862.88s: recession really is is an inventory
865.04s: correction
866.16s: we've got some very big inventories
867.92s: building around the country and
870.56s: so you know it's just those kind of
872.64s: things that i think it's not that
874.40s: they're not seeing them i just think
876.40s: they're being kind of distracted by the
878.40s: headline inflation numbers
880.96s: and as i say you know there's leads and
883.68s: lags to policy
885.36s: so you need to be looking i mean
887.44s: greenspan was probably the one fed
889.52s: chairman that i saw
891.12s: got this to to a degree
893.36s: and he was notorious early on in his
895.28s: career when he was a private economist
898.40s: has not been a very good
900.24s: market person and stuff but he learned
903.60s: and during his reign as as fed chairman
907.52s: he was zigging and zagging uh earlier
910.32s: than was typical for for a fed
913.28s: um because he understood that if i wait
917.04s: for the you know the proof
919.36s: it's too late so and that's kind of what
921.68s: gave us the first elongated cycle we had
924.72s: under his regime and this one's very
927.36s: long but it's for different reasons
930.80s: and interestingly you already
932.64s: read my my mind on the next follow-up
935.52s: question which is with seeing a lot of
937.92s: commodities coming down as aggressively
940.40s: as they are
942.08s: sometimes we could view that as a
945.04s: leading indicator of
946.96s: where inflation might be going
949.76s: but with things crashing as hard as they
952.72s: are i would be
955.12s: interested in your perspective on what
956.96s: is the propensity for a recession as you
960.24s: see it today right now
961.98s: [Music]
963.20s: yeah i i believe we're in recession
965.28s: right now
967.28s: but you know we're probably gonna get a
969.28s: negative gdp print for the second
971.28s: quarter so
972.56s: you know by definition first quarter was
974.56s: negative second if that doesn't get
976.16s: revised you can have two consecutive
978.00s: quarters of negative gdp that's a
980.08s: recession but even more than that it's
982.72s: these other things we're seeing in the
984.48s: economy
985.60s: that suggest if we're not in recession
988.32s: we're pretty darn close
990.24s: and my concern is again
992.96s: that
995.68s: what's lining up is that from here the
998.16s: drop gets a lot more aggressive so you
1000.96s: know housing is rolling over
1003.68s: i think it rolls over hard in the coming
1006.00s: months
1007.04s: um autos could roll over hard
1010.72s: um
1011.76s: you know you're seeing retail having to
1014.40s: correct that
1015.44s: you know historic inventory number
1017.84s: that's going to cause problems the
1019.84s: consumer is tapped out i mean he's you
1022.24s: know with gasoline at five dollars now
1024.64s: yes it's come down but still high
1027.04s: you know he just doesn't have
1028.08s: discretionary spending
1029.92s: and what i think we are seeing this
1031.68s: summer
1032.88s: is you know the pandemics also made
1034.96s: things harder to forecast probably or
1037.28s: made it different
1038.88s: what we're seeing this summer i think is
1041.44s: uh consumers are switching
1044.00s: they don't have money for both so
1045.44s: they're switching from you know the
1047.28s: material buying that they did during the
1049.20s: pandemic you know allows
1050.96s: a lot of money spent on their houses and
1053.76s: their yards and
1055.52s: um
1056.40s: things like that
1057.84s: um the exercise equipment etc computers
1061.36s: now they're they're switching to
1064.16s: experiences you know we're going to go
1065.76s: on vacation we haven't done a long
1067.60s: vacation a long time we're you know
1069.60s: we're going to
1070.72s: take uh uh
1072.64s: an error you know
1074.24s: uh we're gonna we're gonna take an
1076.00s: airline and go somewhere um
1078.80s: we're seeing a lot more of that we're
1080.08s: going to do a cruise so they're not now
1083.36s: they're kind of backing off from the
1085.04s: expenses on the home
1086.96s: uh and other you know material
1089.68s: purchases
1090.88s: um durable purchases and they're going
1093.20s: to you know maybe a little more vacation
1096.32s: type stuff
1097.52s: uh dining out what have you my concern
1100.32s: is that's kind of
1101.92s: probably more seasonal than anything
1104.48s: it's
1105.20s: it's because of summer they're saying
1107.28s: hey we didn't get to take a vacation
1110.00s: the last two years because of the
1111.28s: pandemic
1112.48s: and they're doing it but they may be
1114.64s: kind of extending themselves to do it
1117.04s: when someone gets done that's gone
1119.60s: but it doesn't mean you flip flop back
1121.60s: to the
1122.56s: you know the
1123.84s: material purchases so you're still going
1125.60s: to be
1126.48s: i think in a situation where both are
1128.56s: gone and there goes the economy
1130.88s: you know service in other words services
1132.64s: and
1133.60s: um you know
1135.12s: consumer spending are gone
1139.52s: one of the interesting articles i read
1141.28s: not too long ago it was from one of the
1143.12s: banks i don't remember if it was uh
1144.88s: goldman i think it was goldman but they
1146.48s: were talking about this was only a few
1148.16s: months ago and they were talking about
1149.92s: how
1151.12s: consumers had
1153.72s: unhistorically high
1156.08s: savings because of what they were seeing
1159.44s: you know the stimulus from kovid they
1161.28s: weren't spending a ton on like you were
1162.96s: just highlighting a lot of vacations
1164.40s: going out things like that
1166.24s: and it seems like the burn rate for that
1169.44s: is much faster than than they
1171.36s: anticipated or
1173.20s: it seems like they might have been
1174.48s: messaging that to try to get people to
1176.32s: calm down a little bit but when does the
1178.96s: pin drop in your mind when saying yeah
1182.16s: consumers are tapped out they've
1184.00s: essentially spent what they could they
1185.60s: don't have money to spend more
1187.76s: when when does that occur like yeah when
1190.64s: does that occur in your mind now
1192.56s: yeah i think it's about to occur or is
1195.04s: it correct so we're there um frankly you
1197.12s: know we had a 35
1199.44s: savings
1200.56s: rate
1201.44s: back in the pandemic because of all the
1203.44s: handouts you know you had trillions of
1205.52s: money going out to people in terms of
1207.84s: the stimulus checks
1210.08s: um
1211.20s: and we had i mean it was unprecedented
1213.44s: we never saw money like we've seen come
1215.52s: out of the government
1217.04s: it got it got banked it got put in
1219.12s: savings
1220.72s: that has gone from a 35 rate down to 4.4
1224.80s: rate which is actually below the
1226.64s: pre-pandemic levels
1228.96s: um
1229.76s: that's to have that happen in a matter
1232.00s: of months you know i think a year
1234.80s: is just unbelievable
1237.12s: and it's it's a sign of two things one
1242.56s: that the consumer is having trouble
1245.52s: keeping up with cost living but secondly
1248.88s: and this is the thing that's hard to get
1250.56s: a handle on
1252.16s: is there's a lot of people who took that
1254.72s: money and said hey this is great i don't
1256.64s: have to work
1258.00s: you know i'm staying home
1259.92s: and they
1261.36s: they're at that level now where
1263.52s: they used up that savings in many cases
1267.20s: and yeah there's still jobs out there
1269.60s: right now
1270.64s: but that may not be the case six months
1272.72s: from now and
1274.32s: you know you are seeing particularly in
1275.92s: the technology sector
1277.92s: lots of big layoffs in companies that
1280.16s: never had layoffs you know the the
1282.08s: teslas of the world the apples of the
1283.84s: world the
1284.96s: um
1286.08s: googles of the world
1287.60s: you know the facebook's the world
1288.80s: they're they're starting to have to look
1291.52s: at costs and cut costs and
1294.64s: um that i think that's going to be for
1297.20s: them
1298.08s: for the younger generation
1300.40s: you know
1301.44s: a place where it was always a source of
1304.00s: jobs may not be anymore and then you
1307.28s: know
1307.92s: kind of anecdotally
1309.84s: you know you you
1311.36s: anywhere you go restaurants are saying
1313.60s: we can't get help
1316.16s: you know
1317.28s: dry cleaners are saying we can't get
1319.04s: help you know uh the targets of the
1321.76s: world you know they're
1323.68s: their stores are messier because they
1325.12s: don't have the same
1326.48s: uh ability to get
1328.16s: um you know part-time employees to do
1330.64s: the work or what have you so
1332.88s: i i think we have
1334.72s: somehow the pandemic has changed
1337.60s: particularly that entry level
1340.16s: um person
1341.84s: you know or or that crowd of people
1344.64s: particularly let's say part-time high
1346.96s: school help
1348.24s: you know
1350.32s: summer help
1351.68s: during your college years etc we're just
1353.92s: not seeing
1355.52s: the same flow of people into those jobs
1358.72s: and i
1359.60s: i don't hear anybody talking about that
1361.20s: but i think that is part of the story
1363.60s: too
1365.84s: yeah that's it's an interesting
1367.28s: perspective because as you are just
1369.20s: sharing some of the places that are
1370.48s: short of help uh even here you know
1372.64s: you're on the east coast i'm on the west
1373.92s: coast and it's the same exact thing here
1375.44s: in san diego we're seeing the same exact
1377.68s: instances where places are having a hard
1379.52s: time finding people and
1381.12s: also to your point you know on revising
1383.52s: guidance i don't know if you saw that
1384.96s: apple you know they just essentially
1387.20s: advised revised guidance a couple days
1389.52s: ago they're coming up on earnings soon
1391.36s: um i think this week or next week and
1394.24s: they were saying you know hey we're kind
1396.16s: of slowing spending we're slowing
1398.40s: developmental spending over the next
1399.92s: year we're kind of buckling up here and
1402.40s: i think that shook a lot of people up
1404.48s: because of exactly what you're talking
1406.56s: about you know everybody looks at apple
1408.64s: i mean apple literally is a cash cow i'm
1411.44s: pretty sure they have like a swimming
1413.52s: pool of gold coins that scrooge mcduck
1416.24s: could swim in um but even they're
1418.88s: talking about they want to slow it down
1420.48s: so i think everybody's looking at that
1422.40s: as kind of a precursor that you know the
1425.04s: even the big names with a ton a ton of
1427.28s: support and resources are starting to
1428.88s: slow it down so
1430.40s: i think that
1431.84s: yeah go
1433.36s: yeah i was going to say because i i'm so
1435.36s: you know we're talking so much about the
1437.28s: near term
1438.40s: but as you know i have a forecast for
1441.28s: the next year of a global bust
1443.44s: so
1444.64s: getting from here to there
1446.80s: may not be you know a complete straight
1448.96s: line we may have a bounce in one of
1451.12s: these quarters
1452.48s: um
1453.44s: but
1454.64s: i think what
1456.00s: is being overlooked is because i keep
1458.40s: hearing
1459.68s: uh
1460.40s: among a lot of pundits and elsewhere
1463.92s: um a lot of people talking soft landing
1466.56s: and saying well the market's you know
1468.72s: pretty much discounting a
1470.56s: a shallow recession we're not we're not
1472.96s: looking for anything you know deep
1475.68s: and i feel like everything is lining up
1478.00s: for a very deep recession in fact what i
1480.16s: call the biggest downturn in the past 80
1482.32s: years
1483.28s: and
1484.64s: but it doesn't get there
1486.88s: immediately you know it it kind of
1488.88s: gradually gets there you it's
1491.28s: it's like
1492.56s: things happen slowly and then all of a
1494.24s: sudden they happen fast and and i i
1497.52s: think
1498.40s: at least from what my work shows right
1501.04s: now
1502.80s: we're probably not going to see that
1504.16s: bust
1505.44s: much before the end of the year
1507.68s: uh and it'll dominate 2023
1510.96s: but it's all one thing people on twitter
1513.28s: will ask me
1514.72s: you know what happens between your
1516.40s: recession and your bust i go it's all
1518.24s: one thing it's all part of the same
1520.56s: um you know fed tightening cycle it's
1522.80s: all part of the same thing it just
1525.76s: you know it doesn't necessarily all
1527.44s: happen in a very linear way number one
1530.56s: right and number two even if it is
1533.04s: fairly linear it takes time to get to
1535.68s: that second stage where
1537.76s: it's it's
1538.80s: what's global and number two it's very
1540.72s: deep
1542.48s: and there's kind of two different
1544.16s: avenues i want to discuss off of that
1546.00s: i'll i'll pivot more to just your
1548.40s: overall assessment first because again
1551.84s: everybody would string me up if i uh
1554.24s: didn't dive a little further into what
1556.08s: you're expecting and
1557.92s: it's for good reason you have a very
1559.76s: informed opinion so
1561.76s: i know the last time we spoke we were
1564.08s: talking about a melt up leading into a
1568.16s: global bust
1569.60s: and i know on twitter people are always
1572.00s: at your throat you know asking is this
1573.68s: the melt up is this the melt up is that
1575.84s: the melt up
1577.20s: and
1578.16s: one of the things i
1579.92s: am
1580.96s: wanting to understand from your
1582.48s: perspective is
1584.64s: it a lot of times we do see that right
1587.36s: where there is a pretty profound
1590.24s: movement in the broad scale markets
1592.32s: before there's a even broader decline
1594.56s: that that's fairly common throughout the
1596.16s: history but
1597.36s: how much
1598.48s: does the fed interjection
1601.92s: factor into your decision if it does at
1604.48s: all i'm curious if what they're doing
1608.56s: and what kind of impact that has on your
1611.04s: assessment of things
1612.80s: yeah first i i am still calling for that
1614.88s: melt up and i think
1616.56s: i think the lows are in for this
1619.28s: you know no guarantees i mean it's true
1622.96s: it's quite possible that you could um
1626.88s: you know undercut the 3650 on the s p
1629.60s: and go down to 3 500 i i can't rule that
1632.48s: out that could happen but i think the
1634.64s: more likely scenario is that we saw the
1636.80s: lows in june down at 36.50
1639.52s: we've been basically spending the last
1641.12s: month kind of slowly working our way up
1643.28s: from 36.50 you know got up to
1646.00s: 39
1647.20s: almost 4 000 today and backed off
1650.16s: um i don't know where it is now but um
1653.52s: and so
1654.88s: you know i i think we can
1657.84s: you know there's a pretty good chance
1659.28s: that we saw the lows
1661.36s: um you know if i were picking a scenario
1663.68s: and again it could go any number of
1665.60s: different ways
1666.88s: but right now there's a setup where we
1668.80s: could go to 41 4200 and then back off
1672.32s: back to
1673.60s: 38 or 900 but still stay above the lows
1678.08s: um so that you can say the bottoms in or
1681.20s: the you know
1682.40s: the worst of the
1683.92s: correction is behind us
1685.92s: but that doesn't mean you're off to the
1687.36s: races in the next two weeks um right
1690.16s: yeah you got the fed meeting next week
1692.72s: etc so
1694.16s: so that's what's confusing when people
1696.24s: say is it melt up beginning well
1698.48s: um people might if i said yes people
1700.80s: might take that to mean okay we're
1702.48s: straight up from here no
1704.88s: it's probably still in a period where
1706.96s: it's going to be back and forth trying
1708.48s: to sort this out but i think the lows
1711.12s: may may well be in
1713.28s: um and i do believe over the course of
1715.52s: the next several months
1717.20s: we're going to head towards 6 000 on the
1719.20s: s p 20 000 on the nasdaq
1722.08s: um you know forty five thousand on down
1724.32s: those are huge historic moves uh if they
1727.60s: happen as fast as they could meaning
1730.16s: by the end of the year or you know it
1732.16s: could spill over into next year that's a
1734.72s: a very steep move that's almost
1737.04s: unprecedented certainly only press
1739.52s: president a couple times in history
1742.56s: um but i think that's what we're
1744.24s: probably gonna have people go
1746.00s: based on what i just talked
1748.08s: with you about eric in terms of the
1749.76s: economy
1751.04s: for a lot of people that seems like
1753.52s: it doesn't jive you know how how can you
1755.68s: be talking about
1757.52s: when i'm talking about such awful
1759.44s: economy in the next year
1761.36s: um
1762.16s: and what i think can happen is the fed
1764.00s: can pivot or the fed can see some of
1766.48s: what i'm talking about coming in terms
1768.40s: of the economy and say hey maybe we did
1770.88s: go too far
1772.16s: and they can they can either just pause
1774.32s: or they could even pivot
1776.24s: and
1777.28s: the market is so bearish right now and
1780.08s: so positioned for the downside
1782.48s: that they
1783.84s: may have to first of all cover shorts
1786.64s: and secondly come running back in
1788.96s: because they're out of sync with what's
1790.72s: going on i think we can have a very
1792.96s: concentrated move
1794.88s: um and people say well
1797.52s: if people see
1798.96s: the bad news in economy how can they
1800.72s: justify buying
1802.64s: what will happen is they'll view this as
1805.60s: the tightening cycle is over
1807.76s: the fed's beginning to have our back is
1810.24s: you know the wind's at our back again
1811.92s: instead of in our face
1814.24s: we can look over the trough and start
1816.64s: seeing better times
1818.56s: six months or nine months from now
1821.04s: markets discount six and nine months in
1823.28s: advance
1824.56s: um
1825.44s: does that mean six or nine months from
1827.04s: now things are gonna be good
1829.28s: i don't think so i think they're gonna
1830.64s: be bad but that's my expectation that's
1833.92s: my forecast the street could easily say
1836.96s: okay the fed did its job we're having a
1838.88s: soft landing and we can look over the
1841.28s: soft landing to better times
1843.84s: and at better times if if
1846.80s: if inflation starts coming down as i
1848.88s: think it will if the oil prices keep
1851.36s: coming down as i think they may as some
1854.16s: of these things show up in the inflation
1856.00s: numbers
1857.04s: people can start saying hey the fed did
1858.88s: its job now we have room for you know
1861.36s: the
1862.16s: next
1863.44s: part of the cycle you know or it extends
1865.36s: a cycle for a couple few years
1868.08s: again
1868.96s: i'm not forecasting that but that's what
1871.20s: street expectation could become that
1873.28s: could justify
1875.04s: a big run in the market and what i think
1876.80s: is pretty clear
1878.64s: is that everybody right now
1881.36s: i should say everybody certainly a large
1883.12s: majority people
1884.56s: expect lower lows
1886.40s: expect you know a longer tightening
1888.88s: cycle
1889.92s: if that
1891.28s: changes if people's expectations change
1895.52s: you will be
1896.64s: very
1897.84s: um i think people will be very surprised
1901.04s: at how fast we go from this
1904.64s: negative environment we've had all
1906.32s: through this year
1907.84s: into a very positive environment
1910.64s: marked market-wise
1912.88s: right yeah that it's a fascinating
1914.88s: perspective and i could see the the
1916.80s: catalyst in that scenario
1919.36s: especially because you're right i do
1920.88s: think
1921.60s: um the broad sentiment is everybody's
1924.00s: buckling up for a bumpy ride so if it
1926.24s: seemed like the fed was starting to
1928.48s: change or even soften their tone i think
1930.48s: the market and they have a couple times
1932.16s: the markets react already you know in in
1934.16s: some small ways regarding potential rate
1936.56s: raises so that leads me to the next
1938.56s: question then
1939.92s: which is
1940.88s: if
1941.76s: that doesn't happen so let's say we get
1944.72s: to the next fomc meeting and the fed
1946.88s: says
1947.76s: nope inflation is still too high
1951.28s: do you still think that there's a
1953.44s: scenario for the melt up to occur before
1956.24s: the bust and if so what does that
1958.08s: scenario look like
1960.00s: yeah i i will tell you i've said this
1962.08s: many times on on twitter i always say
1964.24s: that the bond market leads and the fed
1966.48s: follows so i'm i'm not in the business
1969.44s: of trying to predict what jay powell is
1971.12s: going to do or what fomc is going to do
1973.60s: on any you know at any given time i can
1976.24s: give you a general idea what i think
1978.16s: they might do over time
1980.00s: but
1980.96s: how do i know what they're going to do
1982.80s: you know i don't
1983.92s: frank you know my guess is we'll see 75
1985.92s: base points which is pretty much
1987.20s: consensus right now in
1989.20s: next week's meeting
1990.88s: but i can't
1992.40s: say it couldn't be a hundred you know
1994.16s: it's you you know they're humans they
1995.92s: can make their mind up next week
1998.32s: um so i don't i don't play the game of
2000.16s: trying to predict exactly what they're
2001.60s: going to do and you know particular
2003.68s: meeting and i also don't play the game
2005.76s: of saying okay
2007.44s: i know july's last one and they're not
2009.76s: going to hike in september i have no
2011.92s: idea
2012.88s: but what i can do with some
2014.64s: predictability
2016.24s: is look at the bond market and i think
2018.72s: the bond market is signaling
2021.52s: lower rates
2022.96s: so i you know whether the fed
2025.52s: is in sync with what the bonds are going
2027.28s: to be doing over the next three months
2029.68s: i can't tell you but i'm pretty sure at
2032.32s: least my confidence is that
2034.80s: that in the over the next three months
2037.20s: interest rates are coming down
2039.12s: treasury bond wise you know i think the
2041.44s: 10 year is heading
2042.88s: for two and a half and maybe two percent
2044.96s: by the end of the year
2046.56s: i think the 30 years heading you know
2049.12s: down from three percent down now right
2051.92s: now we're getting a little back up in
2053.20s: rates last two days
2055.04s: you know we could go to 320 on the 10
2057.20s: year before we go down
2059.20s: that's you know it's currently you know
2061.44s: three percent are there abouts
2063.68s: because the fed is is behind the curve
2067.04s: they can hike
2068.56s: uh and my my
2070.24s: my forecast is not dependent on whether
2072.24s: they stop after july or whether there's
2074.56s: another hike in september it really
2077.44s: doesn't matter as long as bonds are
2079.60s: doing what i expect
2081.28s: and i'm pretty confident that we're
2082.80s: going to see lower rates
2084.64s: lower inflation
2086.32s: and the fed will you know maybe pause
2088.88s: after july or maybe pause after
2090.96s: september
2092.16s: i think it's one or the other
2094.16s: um and i
2096.24s: i don't think my scenario you know melt
2098.32s: up scenario depends on which it is
2101.68s: so
2102.64s: um like i said i just i can give you my
2105.12s: best guess that they pause after july
2107.44s: but
2108.40s: i'm not too you know i'm not too uh
2111.52s: confident that i can predict what
2113.12s: powell's gonna do in the next two months
2115.12s: you know three months
2118.72s: so so basically my forecast is they melt
2121.52s: up first and haven't changed
2123.52s: melt up first to the same targets i've
2125.52s: had all year
2126.88s: and then
2128.24s: uh a global bust and an 80 bear market
2132.16s: so
2133.04s: i i think that we're nowhere near the
2135.12s: end of trouble
2136.96s: i just think there's a respite here
2138.72s: that's going to be surprisingly strong
2141.36s: in terms of how it's reflected in the
2142.96s: market
2145.28s: yeah that that's really helpful context
2147.12s: to understand the catalyst specifically
2149.36s: for the melt up mostly coming from bonds
2152.56s: and whether or not the fed has you know
2154.72s: a
2156.16s: contributing factor or not that's less
2159.36s: so the focus for you which is
2161.44s: um it's interesting to watch that so i'm
2163.36s: actually um really curious to see how
2165.68s: how that will work out and then we have
2167.60s: you know a little less than five minutes
2169.04s: left so
2170.24s: i would love to understand
2172.80s: what precedes the bust how
2175.68s: do you see the economy looking
2178.24s: when we start hitting your targets from
2182.00s: the melts up and what is the economic
2184.80s: functions that start leading to the
2187.36s: actual bust i'm assuming it has to come
2189.92s: from a global scale so there's probably
2191.60s: external
2192.80s: factors as well but yeah love your
2194.96s: thoughts
2195.92s: yeah so it's
2198.32s: there's a lot of different aspects of
2200.00s: this um because it is a global bust
2203.04s: um i think some of the trouble is going
2205.84s: to be the triggers are going to come
2207.44s: from overseas whereas you know in 2009
2210.72s: it was our subprime problem was the
2212.72s: primary trigger
2214.64s: um this time around i think europe's in
2216.88s: more trouble than we are obviously
2219.36s: you know everything going on in ukraine
2221.36s: and going on with natural gas
2223.60s: those are all things that are putting
2225.44s: you know if we're in trouble
2227.68s: europe's really in trouble right i mean
2229.92s: they don't know whether they're going to
2231.28s: have energy to
2233.60s: to heat homes next winter to the degree
2236.32s: they need so
2237.60s: um
2238.56s: and
2239.44s: inflation's really breaking out there as
2241.84s: it is here
2243.20s: and they still are in on the short end
2246.08s: still in negative rate territory and so
2249.60s: um they have to hike you know tomorrow
2251.76s: the ecb
2252.88s: decides what they're going to do there's
2254.72s: you know talk of a 50 base point hike
2258.00s: um we don't know what they're going to
2260.08s: do you know it's going to be a hike i
2262.08s: think pretty definitely whether it's
2263.36s: quarter or 50 i don't know
2266.08s: but
2267.04s: though those are
2268.80s: the kind of things that i think could be
2271.36s: part of where the bus comes from as well
2273.68s: is
2274.96s: they have to they may be hiking into a
2277.36s: very weak environment even more so than
2279.44s: we are
2280.48s: and there may they may not have as much
2283.92s: staying power as we did during this
2286.32s: period of higher rates you know that we
2288.56s: had some resilience built in that
2290.96s: that they don't have so
2292.72s: you know all of that
2294.16s: you've got a
2295.68s: more leveraged financial system over in
2297.76s: europe this time around you've got um
2301.04s: you know weaker
2302.72s: you know i think
2304.00s: hollower economies for a number of
2306.00s: reasons uh the ecb you know you've got
2309.76s: different countries in different places
2311.52s: so their policy
2312.96s: can really hit some of the countries
2314.40s: hard and harder than others
2316.72s: and and your strong points
2319.20s: you know particularly germany
2321.12s: is is facing some pretty dire situation
2324.08s: so so there's lots of reasons to point
2326.08s: to europe as a problem i think australia
2328.72s: and canada
2330.08s: if if um you know commodities start
2332.56s: coming down here that's going to impact
2334.72s: them
2335.60s: canada's housing is where we were in
2338.16s: 2009 they're much more leveraged
2341.84s: than we are today
2343.68s: um australia's
2345.52s: uh real estate is is
2347.84s: straight up for you know
2350.08s: a long time so they're very vulnerable
2353.12s: there's and and then you know we have we
2355.28s: have asia that's having to deal with a
2356.96s: very strong dollar
2358.96s: that's you know that's an unknown in
2360.96s: terms of
2362.00s: when are we going to have some accidents
2363.76s: come about because
2365.76s: uh you know a lot of these these uh
2368.40s: particularly emerging countries
2370.40s: flood the debt in dollar terms
2372.96s: you know a dollar denominated debt
2375.52s: and now you've got a dollar through the
2377.12s: roof and they have to
2378.72s: they have to use those dollars to pay to
2380.72s: service their debt
2382.40s: and some are going to be able to make it
2384.32s: so there's those things are all working
2386.24s: they're all there they can come at any
2388.16s: time i'm i'm betting that we're going to
2390.40s: see the fed
2391.92s: recognize some of those problems and put
2393.76s: some pressure on the you know it's one
2396.64s: of the reasons why i expect
2398.00s: maybe july is the last hike for a little
2400.24s: while
2401.12s: and then you know it will impact the
2402.96s: dollar on the in terms of pushing it
2405.12s: back down some so
2406.72s: there's there's lots of you know moving
2408.80s: parts here but i think generally what
2411.36s: that's all pointing to is
2413.52s: um you know maybe we've done
2416.16s: all we can do on the downside here in
2418.40s: the short run
2419.68s: and that way maybe we have a respite of
2421.52s: three to six months where
2424.16s: you know markets can
2425.68s: can see the glasses half full
2428.88s: man
2429.84s: it is no shortage of drama out there
2432.96s: it's it really is interesting just
2435.28s: understanding the the broader scale
2437.20s: because a lot of times i feel like from
2438.56s: the u.s side we think about the us but
2441.12s: we do forget especially as retail
2443.28s: traders in my opinion um you know for my
2445.76s: community that there is a lot of
2447.68s: interconnectedness and a lot of that has
2450.16s: profound impacts uh of of scale so i
2454.32s: appreciate you walking us through just a
2456.40s: little bit of the broader landscape we
2458.56s: are
2459.28s: up at time here so i want to make sure
2462.00s: we get you um out the door on time
2465.12s: for uh anybody that wants to find you i
2467.84s: know that you're on twitter at dave h
2470.24s: contrarian i'll throw that link in the
2473.04s: video description below for anybody who
2474.56s: wants to find you there and then there
2476.88s: are plenty of people that impersonate
2479.76s: you
2480.40s: so i will be very explicit about the
2482.88s: right accounts to follow so that folks
2484.40s: can find you um but thanks a ton you
2486.96s: know for hanging out for a little bit
2488.24s: sharing your thoughts sharing the
2489.52s: information you've amassed over a really
2492.56s: long career in the markets it's
2494.40s: extremely beneficial to us so thank you
2497.60s: yeah thanks eric um enjoy it and the
2500.32s: last thing i'll say is
2502.08s: we didn't talk about it in in specific
2504.80s: terms but really psychology is a big
2507.04s: part of markets
2508.48s: and that's what people have to
2509.76s: understand is don't don't just focus on
2513.04s: you know what's the economy doing what's
2514.56s: the fed doing also understand
2516.72s: what's already discounted and and you
2519.04s: know what
2520.40s: where is psychology at right now
2522.24s: psychology is very bearish
2524.48s: and that usually indicates that you're
2526.72s: pretty close to a turn in the other
2528.40s: direction
2530.16s: we will soon find out thank you so much
2532.88s: for your time david really appreciate it
2535.20s: okay thanks eric take care
