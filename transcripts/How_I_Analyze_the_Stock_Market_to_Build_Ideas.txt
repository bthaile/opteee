0.72s: what's up outliers today I'm going to
2.32s: show you exactly how I analyze the stock
5.92s: market to come up with a disposition so
9.40s: this informs everything that I do to
11.52s: make sure that the individual positions
13.24s: I'm putting on make sense relative to
16.56s: what I think is going on in the big
18.72s: picture so we're going to walk through
20.92s: three different levels that I like to
22.76s: look at and then I'm going to give you
24.36s: specific tools that you can use to
26.56s: analyze the specific data points that I
28.84s: like to look at so what's up everyone
30.72s: Eric here welcome back to the outliers
32.72s: let's get right in so the first thing
34.56s: we're going to start with is kind of
36.08s: this approach to analyzing the stock
37.68s: market you see that there's there's
39.00s: three levels at the very top level I
42.28s: need to understand a little bit about
44.52s: the economy whether I'm trading really
47.32s: really short time frames or much longer
50.08s: time frames I still want to know what's
52.28s: going on now to be clear for shorter
54.84s: term time frames I kind of care less
57.28s: about the much larger picture but my
60.00s: trading typically spans multiple time
62.60s: frames so I'm going to start with the
64.24s: economy then I'm going to rotate over to
66.80s: the stock market this is where I'm
68.88s: looking at things at a bit of a higher
70.36s: level and then I'll get down into
71.96s: individual stocks so let's start with
74.36s: what this process looks like how do we
75.72s: start with the economy well I'm going to
77.92s: look at General production and
80.72s: productive indicators both for the
83.44s: economy RIT large but for then
85.40s: individual contributors us as consumers
88.88s: and as producers
90.44s: so I'm going to look at things like GDP
92.56s: which kind of summarizes a lot of that
93.96s: for US inflation metrics like CPI and
96.80s: PPI I'm going to look at unemployment
99.52s: fomc stances on things fomc right now is
103.72s: a lot more topical than it is sometimes
105.96s: it's not always in Vogue and not all of
107.92s: these things matter the same over
110.12s: different periods of time but I'm kind
111.52s: of starting zoomed out and then clicking
114.64s: in because knowing if we're in expanding
117.24s: or Contracting economy that's really
118.96s: important understanding the direction of
120.92s: inflation so on and so forth so I'm
122.52s: zooming you down into different metrics
125.32s: that kind of matter but in descending
127.44s: order almost so then after we get
130.52s: through kind of the broader government
132.16s: stuff I want to start looking at
134.36s: production so things like manufacturing
136.96s: and then also consumers how are the
139.92s: consumers doing because they're going to
142.32s: consume what's been manufactured they're
145.20s: going to be massive participants in
147.52s: things like the housing market so this
149.40s: is how I visualize the broad Market by
154.52s: starting with the economy so how can we
156.80s: see all these different things well
158.84s: there's a few tools at your disposal and
161.04s: most of them are free so the first one
163.08s: I'll show you is from Fred and this is a
166.84s: really great website that you can set up
169.40s: your own dashboards that look at the
172.52s: specific metrics you're interested in so
175.40s: here I'm looking at the federal funds
176.96s: rate here I'm looking at the consumers
178.76s: so I'm looking at the linqu rate on
180.44s: credit cards I want to see single family
183.00s: Residential Mortgage charge offs or
185.00s: delinquency rates then I can look at
187.04s: charge offs based on businesses because
188.60s: people aren't paying their bills I can
190.64s: look at personal savings consumption
192.64s: literally whatever you want is in here I
194.92s: look at Broad sales as you could tell I
197.12s: look at things like GDP unemployment all
199.68s: of those metrics matter to me you
201.44s: literally can build your own dashboard
203.44s: right here in Fr it's completely free so
205.76s: that's the first resource I would put in
207.80s: front of you for economic data the other
210.20s: resource is also very cool within
213.16s: thinker swim you can come up here to the
215.24s: analyze tab go to economic data and they
218.20s: have a ton of stuff a lot funny enough
220.36s: they pull in from Fred so you can come
222.76s: in here you can look at the monetary
224.44s: data and you can say well I'm curious
226.16s: what M1 looks like it'll give you all
228.68s: different kinds of variations to be
230.92s: clear a lot of them are discontinued so
232.44s: you have to pay attention to that but a
234.00s: lot of them are and so you can see okay
235.52s: well what's M1 here it is you can look
237.60s: at it across different time frames so
239.32s: this right now is the max but I could
240.92s: look over at The Last 5 Years which
243.72s: wonder where Co was and you can Tinker
247.32s: with this in a bunch of different ways
248.88s: just like you can with the rest of your
250.24s: charts so this is another really
252.08s: favorite place that I feel like is
253.48s: generally underutilized in thinker swim
256.40s: so next up we have the stock market how
258.40s: do I look at the stock market there's a
260.12s: couple big steps and again it's in the
262.20s: same thought process is what I was
264.20s: sharing before I'm going to look at the
266.28s: performance of the indices relative to
268.40s: one another I'm going to look at breath
270.60s: indicators like net highs lows tick
272.84s: Trend then I want to look at individual
275.32s: sectors and see how they're performing I
277.96s: want to understand what earnings Trends
280.40s: are going on what does volatility look
282.40s: like and then I want to even get down
284.80s: into the correlations and broader themes
287.60s: that I see happening in the stock market
289.40s: so today some of the bigger themes I see
292.00s: going on are We Care a Lot About
294.56s: inflation which is highly impacted by
297.92s: all of these different kinds of
299.16s: production
300.24s: metrics and efficiency metrics how well
302.84s: we're doing as an economy that that's in
304.48s: laser focus right now from a stock
306.84s: market perspective I like to start by
310.04s: looking at a grid of charts so here
313.04s: you've seen this before in my videos and
315.24s: this is where I just take a look at the
317.24s: the broad indices so this is looking at
319.68s: spy Q's iwm a lot of times I like to use
322.56s: the Futures but a lot of people resonate
324.80s: with these more so I just leave them up
326.32s: because they're equally easy to look at
328.44s: so the Spy is S&P 00 The Q's is
331.68s: technically not just Tech but it's very
333.92s: Tech dominated iwm is 2,000 plus small
337.32s: cap stocks then I have other breath
340.24s: indicators like this is the percentage
342.56s: of S&P 500 stocks above their 50 period
346.28s: moving average here I have bonds
348.72s: sometimes this will switch between bonds
350.44s: and cryptocurrencies and then here I
352.76s: have volatility so when I'm looking at
355.00s: this I'm looking at all sorts of things
356.32s: I want to know how they look in relation
358.16s: to one another like for example iwm had
360.56s: a really outsized move today but it's
363.16s: been lagging compared to both the q's
365.48s: and spy Spy is knocking right at the
368.52s: door of near-term highs whereas Q's
372.00s: still has some ways to go so Tech is
373.88s: lagging a little bit then other tools I
376.40s: like to use are net highs lows so this
378.80s: one down here is for the New York Stock
380.44s: Exchange kind of broader this over here
382.56s: is for the NASDAQ exchange again you'll
385.32s: get a little more Tech skew in here so I
387.88s: use all of these tools starting from the
390.12s: top economy then clicking down into the
394.32s: individual indices themselves see how
397.40s: they're moving by themselves but then
399.60s: also in relation to one another so this
402.00s: is a three-month chart I also like to
403.80s: zoom these out take a look at a
405.76s: six-month chart and see what the overall
408.32s: trend has been especially if I see all
410.48s: the trends are aligned sometimes I'll
412.56s: click in a little bit and say okay well
414.68s: how has this actually looked over a
416.20s: long-term time frame like this right
417.60s: here notice that difference on a six
419.84s: time frame the standard deviation
421.36s: channels are negative sloping but then
423.60s: if I click into a 3month time frame I
426.12s: actually see them ascending so it tells
427.84s: me that there's a level of recovery
430.48s: going on right now so by tinkering with
432.64s: different time frames it gives me
434.00s: different visualizations the other thing
436.24s: I like to look at is volume and there's
438.36s: also an average volume line here that's
440.80s: for the past 20 trading days last month
443.92s: essentially and I want to see is volume
446.56s: picking up on the down moves is volume
448.80s: picking up on the up up moves is volume
450.96s: expanding Contracting all of these
453.40s: different data points feed in to what
455.60s: I'm looking at then I can use other
458.68s: tools like this next grid which lets me
461.88s: look at all of the individual sectors
464.08s: within the S&P 500 so I can see how the
467.08s: S&P 500 is doing here by itself and then
470.28s: I can take a look at all of the
471.96s: component sectors and see what sectors
475.24s: are doing well what sectors are not
476.80s: doing well so like in this case I can
478.48s: see xlk which is technology is actually
481.56s: running negative compared to a lot of
483.60s: other things and xlb kind of Builders
486.68s: they're running about sideways but real
488.76s: estate has been on a tear over the last
491.36s: 3 months and then again sometimes I will
493.72s: come in here and change the time frame
495.76s: to be slightly longer term for Me 3
498.20s: months is about my sweet spot for what I
500.20s: tend to trade and care about but giving
502.24s: you some ideas I want to look like the
505.04s: other thing that I want to bring up is
507.08s: using other tools to summ
510.00s: stuff like what's going on with current
512.16s: earnings are companies beating are they
514.76s: not beating chat GPT is great for this
517.56s: and then themes and Trends this is what
519.64s: lets me kind of come up with broader
521.92s: ideas like for example one of the themes
523.64s: I see right now is real estate has been
526.08s: on a tear relative to Tech and Tech has
528.72s: been slowing down so that's just a theme
532.40s: and maybe when I'm coming up with
533.72s: different trade ideas that will feed
535.00s: into what I'm looking for and then the
537.12s: last part of analyzing the stock market
538.84s: we come down to the the individual
540.12s: stocks which is super simple looking at
542.16s: technical analysis and fundamental
543.84s: analysis I have a video down below that
546.04s: goes into technical analysis for stocks
548.28s: it runs through them in detail but if
550.84s: you guys are interested in another video
552.76s: that walks through analyzing stocks
554.88s: specifically happy to do it just let me
556.36s: know in the comments as always any
558.48s: questions let me know be an outlier I'll
561.16s: see you guys later
