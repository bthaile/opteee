0.00s: What's up, everyone? Welcome back to the outlier podcast. I have Tom Saasnoff back with us. Do you like my a non-serve voice? I feel like when I'm talking casually, it's like a normal voice then whenever introduced somebody I really try to lay it on for you.
14.00s: Yeah, that's good. That's good. Your voice good.
18.00s: Well, it's great to see you again. I always enjoy the opportunity to pick your brain a little bit, see what you're thinking about things. Today, I want to do two things. I wanted to first pick your brain about current markets, obviously.
29.00s: But then I also wanted to spend a little bit of time towards the middle slash later half of the session talking a little bit more about like the beginner trader paradigm and the way that you think about some different elements around that.
42.00s: So I figured we'd start with the broad market, though. What's stuck out to you today other than the fact that we we did get a down tick. I know that that's something that you tend to look for.
53.00s: Well, probably what stuck out the most to me today was that there was there was no two sided trade. I mean, it was down from the opening bell and they, you know, it feels like for most of 2024, whenever they were down, when they opened lower, there was always some kind of rally or head fake or whatever.
71.00s: And today it felt like, you know, there was none of the above. There wasn't an uptick all day. So I think that was the biggest difference for me is that I was kind of waiting.
83.00s: I was kind of waiting to see if they would, you know, try to bounce them or at least have a little bit of a rally at different points and that was pretty ugly all day.
92.00s: Yeah, it was really interesting. I thought too, because to me, it seemed like we started getting some earnings coming out, being ingested and obviously tech was leading the pack down to me, it seemed like tech is in a spot where it essentially has to deliver almost perfectly or exceed on earnings in order for the market not have this kind of response, but how do you look at that?
115.00s: Well, the market's been hyperbolic this year and it's been really tightly concentrated. So for me, you know, I, I just look at it as we were grossly overbought.
126.00s: I mean, personally, I wish we went down last month because that's when I had more bullets to the downside, but I didn't reload all my, you know, downside positions, which I'm sorry about.
139.00s: But, you know, again, I, I think it's, I think it's long overdue. I think a sell off of this nature is long overdue.
148.00s: You know, that's all.
149.00s: That's fair enough. Now, how do you get a sense of when it's due versus overdue? Because I also know the last time it's not, it's not even you can't. It's just, it's something that, you know, I mean, in this business, of course timing is everything.
165.00s: But given the magnitude of the up move this year, there's absolutely no way you could catch this down move because like I caught this down move a little bit, but I've also got caught in the last three stages of the up move, which I already thought we're overbought.
182.00s: So it doesn't get you back to even so it's not even worth it.
185.00s: You know, so, so yeah, you can catch a little bit of the down move, but, but at the same time, you know, you're fighting. You probably put yourself in that position three or four times already this year when it just ran, you know, basically ran over your face.
200.00s: Yeah, that's exactly what I was curious about because I know that you had the last time we spoke was about a quarter ago, and you had your Nvidia fade on.
209.00s: Yeah, it didn't work. It didn't work. I mean, I got some money back in the last month, but it was crappy. You know, like, you know, when you get your face ripped off, it's hard to, you know, you got to be careful about throwing good money after bad.
224.00s: You know, I thought Nvidia was overpriced when it got to $650. I didn't think it was going to, you know, 1100 and then split it.
233.00s: Right. Yeah. And so then that is my follow up question though. When you look at something where it does seem like the market does start to agree with your thesis is now at your point it's too late to move kind of already started to unwind or do you
246.00s: like, well, it really depends on the situation. It depends on the, you know, on the year that it happens and when it happens. Video now.
252.00s: So again, what within video, sorry, I was saying let's think about Nvidia now just to prioritize the way it's harder.
262.00s: It's harder for me to get short Nvidia here now because, you know, I think, I think the way that the way I think of trading is, it's difficult to reload after let's call it a 20% you know pull back when you, when you
281.00s: have been run over in a certain stock. So you're kind of wondering, you know, you're always looking over your shoulder, you're not, you're not firing from a position of strength as a trader.
291.00s: So I think the best thing to do is to kind of just, you know, get back as much as you can and then start from, you know, start thinking kind of clearly again.
300.00s: Don't make it, don't make it, don't let it be personal. That's for sure.
303.00s: Right. That makes a ton of sense. So what other kind of things do you look at now? Like in today's market, what interests you for trade ideas?
310.00s: Well, I looked at a lot of things today. I mean, I know there were some people nibbling on the buy side.
316.00s: I didn't really, I mean, I did very small in, you know, I'm a little bit long like, you know, I've been playing a couple earnings plays, but I look for things that I think are grossly oversold and I stay a little bit long those and I,
332.00s: and I try to keep the rest of my position relatively delta neutral and keep a little bit of short delta like in all the indices and stuff like that.
338.00s: But I also look for some things I think are, you know, like as we closed the, I thought the bonds got kind of cheap when they traded down to 118.
345.00s: And that was a by point for me. So, you know, I got a little bit long bonds. I will mess around with things I think are very oversold.
352.00s: But I'm not trying to fade. I'm a contrarian, but I wasn't ready to fade this move yet.
359.00s: Got it. And what do you think about smalls? I know last time we spoke, you were bullish in them in I remember that distinctly because I had a super bullish in the small caps.
370.00s: Relative to everything else. And we've been eating crow on it all year long. And the last three weeks we got everything back and some it's been an absolutely freaking huge move today was a monster.
383.00s: So, so we finally, you know, it's been like the worst trade in the world because when you're wrong for four or five straight months and you make it all back in two weeks, you got to have like the biggest balls in the world to hold that thing. I held it, but most people can.
400.00s: Yeah, well, I started using just kind of trailing stops to make it a little easier for me to scale myself out a little bit. But luckily it was essentially parabolic.
409.00s: What did you make of that move, though? Because to me that that was actually it makes sense to me. I mean, Paris, Paris are the only things that actually, you know, that I bet on to normalize and price.
422.00s: And I mean, it shouldn't take this long.
426.00s: But the back, the back has been broken now. And I don't think you can, I think you have to be long small caps and short everything else into perpetuity from this point.
437.00s: But when I think of that kind of thesis, I've been really surprised with the move in tech as well, obviously. And today it looked like if I'm not mistaken, the spy is actually up year to date over the cues now.
451.00s: Does that mean I have no idea. I don't know.
454.00s: Let me double check.
456.00s: So it looks like year to date the S&P 500 is up 14.63 cues are up 14.2. So does that like does that mean anything to you? I was a little surprised to see that starting to rotate like that.
469.00s: No, did it normalize a little bit now it doesn't mean that got it. Okay.
473.00s: I mean, I'm not that granular in my trading, you know, like I'm short, both of them that cues and the spy. So.
479.00s: And then do you wait them differently or is it just they, but you get a short, you get a short. Yeah, don't care. No, I wait them based on IVR. So it's just, you know, my biggest position right now is an I WM, but only because of IVR. So it's all short premium and I WM.
493.00s: Got it makes sense.
495.00s: And you look at the performance of bonds and we had the recent change a little bit in the right picture starting to, you know, expect some cuts and stuff like that.
506.00s: Bonds movement. What do you think of it makes sense doesn't make sense.
510.00s: The bond movement recently has made sense to me because I'm not.
516.00s: I'm a buyer of bonds on any dip, but I'm not really bullish on bonds.
521.00s: I think they're going to trade in a, in a really narrow range under one 18 kind of where they close today right around that one 18 level.
529.00s: I like the bonds under one 18. I love the bonds at one 15 or one 16. I'm okay with the bonds at one 17 or one 18.
538.00s: I'm not a buyer at one 19 or 120. So that shows you I'm a very, I'm in a very tight range here. I'm a buyer, you know, one or two handles lower than one or two points lower than here.
551.00s: I'm a seller, you know, one 20, one, one, 22. So I think the bonds are in a very tight range. I think the bonds are the only thing that has been somewhat politicized and, you know,
566.00s: I'm guessing, I'm guessing that the bond market will.
572.00s: Will be a little bit stronger if Trump has the lead and a little bit weaker if he loses the lead, but who knows we'll say.
581.00s: The move that it made, what was it like a year ago from like 127 to like 107 or something like that 130 to 105 forgot.
592.00s: Can you contextualize that for me like over the course of your career. How does that kind of move stack up for you?
598.00s: Well, that was a pretty, that was a pretty heavy down move, you know, what it got when it broke under 120 and went down to, you know, 107 108, that that was pretty significant because it was relentless over a short period of time.
610.00s: But I don't think I think it paled in comparison to the up move from, you know, 130 to 170. And so the up move was absolutely frickin violent.
622.00s: The down move was was more of like, you know, we were all like I know myself in a bunch of other chairs, we started to get long in that 112 113 down to 109 area.
633.00s: And by the time we got through 109, we were way too long already, but, but I liked that area. And you know, it obviously tortured us at 106107, but it didn't last every long went straight back to 120.
645.00s: On the down move when bonds went higher and interest rates went lower, that move from, you know, from 125 130 to 170, that was violent.
654.00s: And it never corrected for like the longest period of time and the yield curve inverted in the process. So that was just frickin nasty.
662.00s: Yeah. So now with it hanging around like 118, where do you see normalize price as the rate environment changes? Or do you think that this is just operating?
672.00s: I think the rate environment, the rate environment is all predicated on what the bonds to 116, they had there's no rate cut at 118, there's one.
683.00s: And at 120, there's probably two. I think it's just totally dependent on where bonds go. If they're stuck here at 118, you know, don't count on much at all, maybe a crappy little one lot, rate cut, one, one rate cut.
696.00s: But if they get down to 116, I don't even think you'll see a rate cut. And if they pop back up over 120, it could be one or two.
703.00s: Now, how do you arrive at that just for everybody else's general learning because obviously the bonds were down at 107, right? So then, and then they got up to I think like 125, where was that like the beginning of 25126? Yeah, they did.
718.00s: So like, but there was no rate changes much during that, at least to the cutting side. So like, when does the bond price move would become informative of rates?
729.00s: Whenever the Fed has to get together and talk about rates, the bond prices are the Fed is never going to fade bond prices. It's mathematically impossible.
739.00s: Like if bonds are dropping, the Fed cannot lower rates. If bonds are rising, you know, price, the Fed cannot raise rates. It's period, the end of the story. The marketplace drives the Fed. The Fed does not drive the marketplace.
752.00s: So in this case, the Fed is the Fed is not driving the car. The bond market's driving the car. The Fed's in the passenger seat. It's always been that way and it always will be that way. The Fed is just a is just symbolic. It's just a figurehead for what what's happening to bond market.
770.00s: And then how do you understand like what bands would then force the Fed's hand for a bond car? Who cares? Who cares?
778.00s: Well, for me, I care from a contextual standpoint, trying to understand that relationship. Like when the Fed is sitting down looking at rates, how do they, you know, we're obviously saying bond informs Fed, that makes sense. I follow that.
790.00s: Yeah, but I'm trying to understand that actual relationship. One is the Fed say, okay, bond market is doing.
796.00s: It's hard. It's hard to say, but you can just think of it in terms of, you know, like, you know, two points make a difference.
804.00s: But, but I, it's very hard to think about the bond market and the stock market in a macro sense. And it's very hard to put like tied hard numbers. I mean, the CME has a Fed watch tool, which is really effective.
819.00s: And it's pretty much spot on, you know, from an odds perspective. But the way to think of bonds is every two points higher or lower, put different cuts back on the table. But that's it.
831.00s: Got it. Okay. And then historically, have you guys seen the way that the Fed responds to that? Are they generally responsive? Because one of the reasons why ask all this is because they have no choice. That is their job. They, they, they, the,
848.00s: the bonds drive the Fed. There is no nothing else to it. Got it. Yeah, the reason why ask is because this recent rate environments really interesting to me, because I've been hearing a lot of like macro people talking about, you know, the Fed's late, the Fed's late, the Fed should have caught already the Fed, you know, the Fed should do this Fed bonds are saying this.
869.00s: I'm just continually trying to contextualize that stuff. But I mean, I always find that's the tricky part about macro is it's kind of.
878.00s: Yeah. Well, the Fed also has a more challenging election year because they have to act like, you know, they have to play the role of, you know, Switzerland. They have to be independent. And they, the integrity of the Fed depends on is really dependent on their on their independent, you know, on how objective they can be objectively independent.
898.00s: So it's important that the Fed maintains that level of integrity. And so I, I don't think in a perfect world. I don't think they're going to do anything that's outside of bond prices. I just don't think they have.
916.00s: Yeah, got it makes sense. Yeah. And thank you for the context. I know some of that stuff might sound elementary to you. But I think a lot of people they hear that statement of, you know, bonds lead the Fed, but it's sometimes difficult to connect those when you're looking at a bond straight in real time. And so anytime you have a real time market that's, you know, that's a few hundred billion dollars deep.
939.00s: You can't, there's no other way to think about it. Like I mean, do you want the real prices or do you want like somebody's, you know, somebody's spitballing and telling you what the Fed should do. No, you just look at the bond prices that your whole markets there.
953.00s: Got it. Yeah.
955.00s: When you look out over the rest of the year and you see the S&P 500, you know, in the first half of the years up, almost 20%.
963.00s: Yeah. What do you think about the rest of the year in that kind of circumstance?
967.00s: Yeah, I think you're probably going to see a market that's that's, I think a little bit lower for the rest of the year. I just think 20% is pushing it to an extreme.
977.00s: So maybe you're maybe you drop 5% from here to the rest of the year or something, you know, not in any particular order, but just I think you're going to be lower.
986.00s: Yeah. Have you guys done studies on that to see like the, there's no, there's no real price mean reversion or normalization and price.
994.00s: There is with pairstrains and because the spreads kind of expanded contract and there is with volatility, but now with price.
1002.00s: Got it.
1004.00s: Somebody had a question for you. They heard that you had played poker with Michael Jordan.
1012.00s: Yeah.
1013.00s: What was that like?
1015.00s: What was it like?
1017.00s: Yep.
1018.00s: Well, it's again that lasted for 18 years.
1021.00s: No, like maybe 16 years.
1025.00s: So need some context.
1029.00s: Context.
1032.00s: When.
1035.00s: When the bulls drafted Jordan in 1984, the bulls stunk.
1041.00s: They were the worst team in the NBA or among the worst teams.
1046.00s: And nobody went to bulls games.
1049.00s: Like 3000 people, 4000 people.
1052.00s: So the bulls were trying to sell tickets.
1055.00s: And they decided when they drafted Jordan, they're going to try to sell floor seats.
1059.00s: And they never sold them before.
1061.00s: So they figured the best place to start was at the board of trade.
1064.00s: Because they would go to all the traders because because we were impulsive and we had money, right?
1069.00s: And we were kids like we know I'm in my 20s, you know, whatever.
1073.00s: I was only like three years older than Michael or something.
1076.00s: And four years older than Michael.
1078.00s: And so.
1079.00s: So they knocked up.
1080.00s: They just happen to get off the elevator like the bulls ticket team.
1084.00s: And they knocked on our door like like the one of the first doors they knocked on.
1087.00s: And we're sitting there.
1089.00s: And they took out a map of the United Center, not the United Center at the time of Chicago Stadium.
1093.00s: And they put it on our desk.
1095.00s: And they can have any see you want on the floor.
1097.00s: And and I remember this day like it was yesterday and we're like.
1101.00s: And we're like, well, yeah, but we don't know if this kid like we know Jordan's good.
1105.00s: Because we won national championship.
1106.00s: But we're like, we don't know if he's going to be like NBA great.
1109.00s: Like we didn't know.
1110.00s: And they're like, we'll just take any seat.
1113.00s: And you only have to buy him for one year.
1116.00s: And they were $75 again, which back then in 1984 was like the most expensive seat you could ever imagine.
1125.00s: 75 dollars.
1126.00s: So there was there was four of us in the office.
1129.00s: And we had a really good day the day before.
1132.00s: So we said, fuck it.
1133.00s: We'll buy.
1134.00s: We'll take the four seats at center court, right in the middle, you know.
1139.00s: And the best the best four seats in the in the Chicago stadium.
1144.00s: So the bulls are right enough to contract.
1146.00s: They do it in a wall by hand right in front of us.
1148.00s: And my buddy who is still here today working, you know, here today.
1153.00s: He goes, no, no, this is this is dumb because.
1157.00s: Because.
1159.00s: Why do you want to sit at center court?
1161.00s: Because you know, let's sit at the end of the bench because Jordan, if he's any good, he, he always sits at the last seat on the bench.
1168.00s: It's his thing in college and high school, you know, he'll always sit on the last seat at the end of the bench.
1173.00s: He doesn't sit on the bench, everybody else.
1176.00s: Let's take the four seats at the end of the bench because in the in the Chicago stadium, the fans.
1183.00s: Seats are right next to the players bench.
1186.00s: There was no room in between.
1188.00s: So we decide, okay, we're like what we didn't care because it's only one year we don't care.
1193.00s: So we took the four seats by the end of the bench.
1196.00s: And four of us.
1198.00s: So we went to the first like two home games.
1201.00s: And after the second game, we're like.
1204.00s: Holy shit.
1205.00s: This kids, this kid's not good.
1208.00s: He's like.
1210.00s: He's another after two games were like, he's another freaking level.
1214.00s: Like he is.
1216.00s: We've never seen like it.
1218.00s: So.
1220.00s: He's a super star.
1222.00s: He's the best player.
1223.00s: He's the best.
1224.00s: You know, there's a little buzz in Chicago that year.
1226.00s: He wins rookie of the year.
1227.00s: Next year he breaks us.
1228.00s: We renew the tickets.
1229.00s: He breaks his foot, but then he comes back against the Celtics, you know, of course like 64 points and blows up the whole league and all the sudden.
1237.00s: Like Jordan is, you know, born.
1239.00s: He's a superstar.
1240.00s: He's the best, you know, he's already that like one of the best players.
1242.00s: Magic and birder still around.
1243.00s: And the pistons were still there.
1245.00s: he starts to become whoever Michael Jordan is.
1248.68s: And one night, I think it was his second year
1251.72s: in the middle of the game, he leans over and goes,
1253.60s: what are you guys doing tonight?
1254.56s: Cause we were bullshitting with him every night,
1256.76s: cause we sit at the end of the bench.
1258.72s: And we go, it was like Thursday night,
1260.24s: and we're like, nothing, I go, what do you wanna do?
1262.60s: He goes, he goes, I wanna play cards.
1264.72s: He goes, after I do my TV hit, after the game,
1268.48s: let's play it 11.
1269.84s: That was like, we go to the floor at four in the morning.
1273.08s: And he goes, let's play it 11.
1274.68s: So we're like, all right, screw, we'll play it 11.
1278.28s: So one of my buddies just got divorced.
1280.84s: We went to his house and we're like,
1284.00s: we tell Jordan where it is, it's somewhere near where he lives.
1286.80s: And in the suburbs, and we go,
1289.20s: we'll meet you there at 11 o'clock, or 11.30.
1292.04s: 11 o'clock comes no Jordan, okay?
1294.52s: 11.30, no Jordan.
1296.64s: And then we're like, in midnight,
1297.80s: we're getting ready to go home,
1298.80s: cause we're like, yeah, this sucks.
1299.84s: The guy never showed up.
1301.60s: He rings the doorbell like midnight.
1304.52s: And he has, and these are all traders.
1308.00s: Like it's just a bunch of traders.
1310.00s: And he shows up with like five grand cash.
1313.52s: And we all had a lot of cash then.
1315.00s: All we'd do is had cash.
1316.64s: So we'd play this huge game of poker and guts
1319.32s: and all this crazy stuff.
1320.92s: And we wiped him out in like an hour.
1324.36s: And he lost all five grand.
1326.36s: Now he's pissed, cause he's really competitive.
1328.60s: I was gonna ask about that.
1329.60s: How much money then?
1330.40s: He's like, he's like, he's on his crappy rookie contract or something.
1334.80s: So he's making like, well, he had a McDonald's deal.
1337.48s: He had some deals, but he's sold.
1339.60s: Jordan, so we can't let you the money.
1341.80s: You know, we're like, you're good.
1343.48s: We know where you live.
1344.80s: He goes, I wouldn't borrow money from you, mother fuckers,
1347.96s: ever.
1348.68s: He goes, he has a bodyguard with them.
1350.84s: So he sends a bodyguard out to get more money.
1353.36s: Kid comes back in like 15 minutes later
1356.24s: with another couple of grand.
1358.08s: We clean him out of that money.
1359.64s: He's pissed.
1361.00s: So he lost like $7,500 and he's pissed at us,
1364.96s: but he still had fun, cause we were laughing, you know,
1367.20s: drinking, he smoking cigars, you know,
1369.68s: he has a ridiculous amount of energy.
1371.64s: We all have to, we all go straight to the trading floor,
1373.84s: cause it's now it's like four in the morning.
1376.12s: You know, my wife's like, where the fuck are you?
1378.96s: I'm like, I'm, you know, I don't know.
1381.44s: I'm playing cards with Michael Jordan.
1383.96s: She's like, sure you are.
1385.08s: You know, you know, and then we go straight to the trading floor.
1389.88s: And the next day I slept, whatever.
1393.36s: And that started 15 years worth of like going to the game at night
1400.52s: and then playing a poker game, you know, at one of our houses.
1405.04s: Most of the time it was at my house or another,
1407.56s: by the way, his house.
1408.40s: But the thing with Jordan, the funniest thing is that,
1411.12s: that he's the only personal world where you can call your wife
1415.32s: on like a Wednesday night or Thursday night and say,
1418.56s: Hey, we're playing cards starting at midnight till five in the morning
1423.36s: on a Wednesday night.
1424.96s: And they're like, okay, no problem.
1427.40s: I'll go get some beer like, like, if it was any of my other friends,
1431.24s: she would have shot him.
1432.64s: But with Jordan, she's like, she's like,
1436.16s: whatever you want, Michael, like, you know, it's, it's crazy.
1439.80s: So that's all right.
1441.80s: Go ahead.
1442.60s: That was it. That was it.
1443.56s: It went on for like literally 15 years.
1446.36s: So did he ever end up getting any of his money back?
1449.40s: Or did you was he just essentially ended up in the end?
1452.16s: He probably killed us, you know, really?
1455.24s: Yeah, he was good.
1456.80s: And yeah, he got all his money back.
1459.60s: And the game is very, we kept the game like to just a small group
1463.64s: of of traders and, you know, we had some, we had some rules like
1468.40s: no autographs, no asking, you know, no talking like, you know,
1473.48s: no like pictures, no autographs.
1476.00s: And, and we kept the game to like the same, like, we rotate like a
1480.44s: total of 10 people.
1481.72s: So in Chicago, it became a thing like, how do I get in that Jordan game?
1484.76s: You know, like, we let anybody.
1487.76s: It was just my friends.
1488.88s: And it was, it was crazy.
1490.12s: And it went on for a long time.
1492.52s: And then, and then, you know, through all the championships and
1495.36s: everything.
1496.36s: And our tickets became crazy valuable because they ended up, you know,
1500.96s: being the tickets ended up being gold.
1504.76s: So, the floor seats next to Jordan were the most valuable tickets in the
1508.12s: world.
1509.12s: Did your buddy ever who had the idea of picking those instead of center
1513.08s: court? Does he, does he make sure to hang that over everybody's hat or
1515.92s: no?
1516.92s: Yeah, kind of for the, for a couple of years, but then, you know, it, it
1521.04s: wore off.
1522.04s: I don't know.
1523.04s: I feel like I wouldn't let that go for you guys that I would make sure you
1525.84s: know.
1526.84s: It was a great story.
1528.04s: The whole ride was, you know, the six championships.
1530.60s: Everything was amazing, you know, I mean, then he got just too big,
1534.16s: you know, he got, you know, he got, he got, he got, he was, you know, he
1538.28s: was on a different level.
1540.04s: I mean, he got to a point where we weren't big enough for him.
1544.60s: Yeah, well, you kind of have to, you expect that at some point,
1548.16s: especially when he's the, essentially the goat of basketball.
1551.32s: But did you learn anything from him when you guys played poker
1554.88s: together?
1555.88s: No, I mean, he was a interesting character because he didn't have
1561.60s: like a crazy amount of friends, I don't think.
1564.12s: And so we were like these weird friends of his that because, you know, we
1570.48s: were just different, you know, he liked us because we like to gamble on
1574.76s: anything and he liked to gamble on anything.
1576.60s: So that was the relationship.
1578.36s: Um, you know, we would talk, we would laugh a lot.
1581.68s: You know, it's just, it was just like guys night out.
1583.72s: You know, that's all it was.
1584.52s: It was nothing.
1585.92s: It was just, um, you know, played golf a little bit, played some
1590.88s: gin, you know, did a Vegas trip, not with him, but met him in Vegas,
1595.24s: you know, crazy stuff like that.
1596.56s: But it was, it was a great story to tell my kids, you know, it's good.
1601.68s: Did they ever chance to meet him?
1603.64s: Yeah.
1604.72s: That's why he asked my daughter wants to open a beer for her for him.
1608.72s: And um, she was like told everybody in her school 50 times.
1616.36s: That's so awesome.
1618.04s: And the, the Vegas trip, I know can't go too deep because it's Vegas.
1624.52s: But what do you guys do there?
1625.96s: Just go gamble a bunch.
1628.32s: Yeah, they were playing a preseason game and, um, in, at preseason game in Vegas
1633.16s: and, and we happened to be in Vegas the same weekend.
1636.16s: So we went to the Mirage and we played, um, we played, uh, back rack all night
1641.68s: long on the private, like area, but it was fenced off.
1645.16s: And it was really fun.
1647.00s: Uh, Rodman was there.
1648.12s: I think Rodman was there and maybe somebody else, but it was crazy night.
1652.00s: And, um, I think we all got killed, but whatever.
1657.32s: Who cares?
1658.04s: Yeah.
1658.84s: Uh, got to ask about Rodman though, because everything I've heard about, like,
1661.96s: the interviews I've seen about him and stuff is that he apparently is a bit of a party animal.
1665.60s: Yeah.
1667.04s: I don't really know.
1668.52s: I've heard stories, um, but, and I know some people that know him.
1672.84s: I, I, I never, I've only met him.
1674.68s: I didn't know him at all.
1676.28s: Um, he was a little bit of a loner, you know, but, um, I, I have a buddy that knows him
1684.12s: really well because Rodman stayed his house for a couple of months.
1686.84s: So, so, you know, so they have, so he told me some stories, but he, he, I, I guess he's a
1692.12s: pretty decent guy.
1693.08s: I just don't know the whole deal.
1695.12s: Yeah.
1695.40s: I was just curious what he would have been like in a casino.
1697.60s: You know, if you have like the, the, the reputation of being a bit of a party animal,
1701.20s: it kind of reminds me of like the, the day.
1703.44s: I'm sure he was.
1704.40s: I'm sure he was nuts, but, you know, like, yeah, at that point, you know, I, I don't know.
1709.20s: Like, you know, they were all, they, they were legit, like crazy, super, like they were,
1717.32s: they were in a different lead of, you know, the status those guys had, you know,
1722.28s: and just as, as superheroes was insane.
1726.52s: And could you imagine anything like that today now with like social media and stuff?
1730.76s: I imagine like those kinds of relationships.
1732.40s: You know, a hard today.
1734.60s: Yeah, they'd be hard because I, I don't think Jordan was a, I don't think he was an
1741.40s: alter boy by any stretch.
1743.68s: And, but who is, you know, who is?
1747.32s: Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
1749.40s: But I don't think, you know, I, I don't know, you know, the amazing thing with him is that,
1754.56s: like, there'd be nights when he would score, you know, 35 or 40 points.
1759.92s: And then he would, you know, hang out with us till five in the morning,
1765.72s: drinking beer and smoking cigars.
1767.40s: And then the next day, he scored 35, right?
1770.68s: Like he had energy, it's, and he was insane.
1774.72s: Like insane.
1777.88s: And that stuff's incredible too, because you hear of other great players like Kobe Bryant,
1782.12s: and he almost has a different approach, right?
1784.44s: Where Kobe Bryant, at least I've never met him right.
1787.00s: So I don't know, but from the things I've watched about him, he seemed like straight into the
1791.92s: discipline, right?
1792.80s: He's like going to the gym twice a day, like after practice and stuff like that.
1796.48s: And then you have people like Mike that run it like that runs me of much less fun story.
1801.96s: But it reminds me my time in the Marine Corps, there were dudes that we would run the PFT.
1805.36s: It's like a three mile run.
1806.76s: Yeah, they would literally be smoking cigarettes before they go run.
1810.28s: And they would crush me.
1811.28s: I would just watch them just run right by me.
1813.28s: And it was some people are, some people are weird.
1816.32s: He was one of those, I think one of those Jeremy Ronik, who was a hockey player in, you know, for the
1823.20s: Black Hawks and other teams.
1825.32s: I think he's in the Hall of Fame.
1826.56s: And Ronik tells the story, which is, I didn't know Jeremy Ronik, but he's kind of one of these party guys too.
1831.80s: It just, he's a bruiser.
1833.12s: Like, you know, he's a tough guy, a big guy, tough guy.
1835.80s: You know, definitely a fighter, that kind of thing.
1838.56s: Talks about a time when he played 54 holes with of golf with Jordan.
1842.40s: And then, and then that night, you know, Mike went out and scored like 45 points.
1847.68s: And Ronik said he could even walk.
1849.52s: And he's a, you know, he was an athlete.
1850.88s: He's like, I couldn't even walk when we were done.
1853.44s: And he plays, and he goes out and scores 45 points.
1855.96s: You know, that is crazy.
1857.48s: It's absolutely incredible, and especially just like that kind of athleticism.
1860.16s: That's just so cool.
1861.56s: Any other fun poker games that you've played memorable poker games?
1866.20s: Yes, but nothing like that.
1868.64s: What's the, what's the, what's the next one?
1873.16s: Oh, you mean our games?
1875.04s: Like the next one in that list.
1876.40s: So you have playing poker with Michael Jordan at 12 to 0 4 before you go to work.
1881.88s: And he goes to play basketball.
1882.92s: That's pretty hard to beat.
1884.44s: What's like the next threshold on your list of poker games that have been really cool.
1888.16s: But maybe not quite there.
1890.76s: Oh, that's like that.
1892.20s: Well, we're not, you know, when we say we played poker, it was a lot of stupid games that were played.
1898.60s: Like, you know, we logged a lot of gin too.
1901.60s: Like a lot, a lot, a lot of gin.
1904.00s: So and Jordan played gin too.
1905.60s: So there was a lot of gin played for a lot of money.
1909.20s: But I don't know.
1912.56s: There's nothing that really compares to that.
1914.40s: I mean, you know, to show you how crazy we were, I'm going way back.
1918.68s: Okay, this is not anytime recent.
1920.56s: This is way before, this is when we're back on the floor.
1923.68s: But we used to play so many card games that we would order cards from the use cards from the golden nugget, 1500 decks at a time.
1935.40s: So the golden nugget and the Mirage, but they're both Steve Winplaces and they would sell their use cards for about a dollar deck.
1946.48s: And they were really good cards, but they, but they punched them.
1949.44s: So they had like a hole in them because they were used, but they would sell them to us for I want to say a dollar, maybe a little bit less.
1955.88s: And they would, but we had a minimum of 1500 we had to buy and we went through about 1500 decks of cards a month.
1964.32s: Oh, shit.
1965.56s: So that's what it was like.
1967.76s: Oh my God.
1969.72s: Yeah.
1973.00s: And that's for a long time.
1975.80s: That's super intense.
1977.44s: So then after the cards, what took place?
1979.88s: Did you guys play other like sports pool darts, anything like that?
1983.00s: Or was it most?
1983.72s: Yeah, yeah, a lot of golf, you know, a lot of everything golf guy.
1989.24s: This play rackable.
1991.96s: I, I did, I wasn't that good at it, but yeah, I did play rackable.
1998.60s: Love me some rackable.
1999.84s: That's, I already decided that that's going to be my, I was telling you before we started that my neck is crunching when I move it now.
2004.96s: I'm already picking my old man games like I got to know.
2007.28s: Well, there's not, there's not a lot of rackable play.
2009.28s: And we're, but I, so I had this, I bought this old loft in Chicago back in the 80s.
2016.76s: It wasn't a lot.
2017.48s: It was like an old big and building and it was really big.
2020.80s: And it was, it was, there was people like squatting in it, living in it when I bought it.
2024.96s: So it was, it was really, I'll tell you,
2029.32s: really funny story.
2030.52s: I find this house.
2031.60s: I think it was like 1986 or something.
2033.92s: And, and I wanted to build like a big, law place to live in.
2037.52s: And I found this place.
2039.00s: And like I said, there was people living there.
2040.76s: It was, it was gross.
2041.96s: It was a dangerous neighborhood.
2043.56s: And I, I tell my wife, hey, I want to show you something.
2047.96s: And I go, it's a real estate investment.
2050.48s: So I drive it in this place and she looks in and somebody runs out the back door.
2054.88s: Okay.
2055.92s: And she goes, why are you showing me this?
2058.52s: And I go, because I'm, I'm thinking of buying it as an investment.
2061.60s: I had already bought it.
2062.92s: You might want to buy it.
2063.80s: I didn't tell her.
2064.84s: So I already bought it.
2065.68s: So she looks at me.
2066.60s: She goes, oh, no.
2069.24s: She knew she didn't care about it as investment.
2072.16s: She's like, I'm not living here.
2074.44s: And I go, I go, that's kind of the game, but she was not me.
2078.00s: You can build this.
2078.96s: You can live here.
2080.16s: I'm not living here.
2082.00s: As we're outside talking, as we're outside talking,
2085.28s: somebody robs a convenience store down the block.
2088.20s: It was running down the alley past us with a gun in the air.
2092.00s: Because I am not living here.
2095.04s: We live there.
2096.12s: We go, we live there.
2098.72s: So the rack of ball piece to it is the place was so big that it had a perfect
2105.00s: room in it to build a racquetball court.
2107.12s: So they sold these racquetball courts that were, you bought the kit.
2111.48s: So I bought the kit and put a racquetball court in the house.
2114.68s: And that's where we, that had a basketball court.
2117.04s: That's where we played basketball and racquetball.
2119.08s: That's so, that's so awesome.
2121.28s: So 1987, this is 1987.
2124.44s: How did you move her through the process of robbery,
2127.96s: dude with gun running by new house into moving into house?
2131.16s: How did that go down?
2133.56s: Um, not well, not easy.
2141.40s: No wonder why the markets don't phase you, right?
2143.84s: You just women, women that married traders that they deserve what they get,
2150.72s: especially in the 80s, you know, that it was, it was her fault for marrying me.
2155.80s: Like it was just a mistake.
2157.80s: And none of these guys were good.
2161.32s: Nobody I knew was a good husband, but in our defense, they weren't great wives either.
2167.76s: It was not, it was, it was a, it was a, nobody was perfect here.
2173.40s: Okay.
2174.88s: Yeah.
2175.88s: Mutually caustic relationship that blossom into a beautiful marriage.
2179.20s: It's perfect.
2180.20s: Yeah.
2180.72s: Yeah.
2181.20s: There was, it was not, yeah, they're not going to write any books about this is the,
2186.76s: um, this is the perfect family and, um, yeah.
2191.88s: Yeah.
2192.08s: There's nothing, no family values in that relationship.
2195.24s: In any of those relationships back then, none.
2198.16s: Perfect.
2198.64s: Well, that's a value in and of itself, right?
2200.36s: You do flexible.
2201.60s: That the man, I can only imagine the, the relationship that you guys built with Jordan
2209.56s: over that time frame.
2210.40s: Because I imagine you guys, you were talking about keeping, keeping it like not fan boy,
2214.60s: right?
2214.84s: Just keeping it normal.
2215.92s: Like there's just a, we kept it very normal.
2218.32s: You couldn't be a fan boy.
2219.36s: I don't even have, I don't even have a Jordan signature on anything, which is amazing at this point.
2225.32s: I got nothing.
2226.40s: Um, one, not even, I don't think I have one thing.
2229.80s: I have a, the only Jordan signature I have is on a white socks jersey as public bake.
2236.88s: The amus.
2237.40s: So I figured that you guys would at least broke like just one, just, just one day where you guys
2242.44s: could have done your signature stuff.
2244.08s: Just one.
2246.04s: Now we didn't.
2247.48s: Not.
2248.96s: That's nuts.
2250.88s: Not even once.
2251.64s: It was kind of it was, it was a, it was an unwritten rule.
2255.28s: Well, and it's also respectful to him because I, I do think it's the same thing.
2260.36s: That you see with other people, right?
2261.48s: Like sometimes you just want to be normal, right?
2263.08s: Just want to feel normal.
2264.28s: And yeah, yeah.
2265.88s: So I think that part's really cool.
2267.48s: I still probably would have broken one signature day.
2270.48s: Like just one adding.
2272.72s: You think you would have, but you wouldn't have.
2274.96s: Because you're just two, you don't want to ruin it.
2276.76s: You just want to let it be shut you down and then we would have kicked you out of the game.
2280.56s: Come on.
2281.60s: Honestly, I suck at poker.
2282.96s: So I wouldn't have been there very long.
2284.16s: Anyways, I would have been there for a few.
2285.56s: You all suck at poker.
2286.72s: You all suck at poker.
2288.68s: Yeah.
2289.04s: Maybe I hate poker.
2290.84s: Poker is the most boring game in the world.
2292.72s: That's why I go with my buddies.
2295.60s: I have a bunch of buddies that love to play poker.
2298.12s: They think they're like pros, but they're not.
2300.60s: But they love, they love going to casinos and like two or three times a year.
2305.04s: I'll go with them to in Chicago.
2308.04s: We have, you know, some poker, some poker, some casinos, some poker rooms.
2311.60s: And I'll go to that with them to have dinner and then play poker.
2314.40s: And after two or three hours, I can't handle anymore.
2318.04s: Like I just haul in.
2319.04s: I want to lose my money.
2320.24s: I just want to get out of there.
2321.48s: Right.
2321.72s: Right.
2321.96s: Yeah.
2322.16s: Just give me an out.
2323.16s: Yeah.
2323.68s: I so slow.
2325.16s: I can't take it.
2325.88s: It drives me crazy.
2327.20s: So then if you had to pick a card game as a gin.
2330.40s: Oh, well, gin's more fun for us to play as like because you can play as it
2334.04s: as a team.
2335.76s: So we like it.
2336.52s: So it's fun.
2337.60s: And it's more there's more table talk.
2340.52s: Um, poker is a little less table talk.
2342.76s: So it's not as much fun.
2344.08s: Um, but we have lots of games.
2346.44s: But yeah, I guess, you know, yeah, it's because anytime I like to gamble, I'll
2352.28s: play.
2353.52s: Bokka or I'll play Crap's and it's.
2356.04s: Oh, yeah.
2356.52s: Oh, and casino.
2357.36s: We'll play.
2358.08s: I would play everything.
2359.40s: Yeah.
2359.72s: Well, I always feel like something like Crap's it's decent edge.
2362.80s: If you play, well, it's never, you know, positive edge.
2365.36s: But like, at least if you can lay, lay odds, it's not terrible.
2368.84s: And there's a lot of yelling, which is the best.
2372.08s: Yeah, yeah.
2372.44s: We, I like noise.
2373.84s: So I like it when the games are rowdy.
2376.20s: Yeah.
2377.24s: It's the, it's the entire reason to do it because you know your play with something.
2380.68s: That's what's about poker.
2381.76s: Poker's quiet.
2382.64s: It's kind of boring.
2384.20s: Yeah.
2384.60s: I guess to, and I mean, how representative of that is of trading, right?
2390.24s: Like the thing that's quiet boring has edge baked into it.
2393.44s: Technically, if you're good at it and the thing that's loud, Rakis, it's one of the reasons
2397.92s: we built Tasty to tell you the truth.
2399.76s: That's one of the reasons we built Tasty because we loved this business.
2404.88s: We loved the open Al Cry aspect to the business.
2407.72s: We loved like the locker room part to being on the floor.
2412.96s: Yeah.
2413.28s: You know, once you got through some of the mechanics, we loved just the fact that it was just noisy
2419.56s: and stupid and, you know, the conversations were just idiotic.
2425.48s: And the, the chatter was nonstop.
2428.08s: It like kept you so engaged.
2430.20s: And we tried to create that same environment in the companies that we built.
2433.88s: And we've done a good job.
2435.24s: We're not, we're not the best HR firm in the world.
2439.68s: But we're not the best, we're not the most politically correct.
2443.48s: But we've been able to keep ourselves out of trouble, out of litigation for 25 years.
2449.52s: So we've done something right.
2451.56s: I imagine you're finding people that align with the values, which is massive.
2455.60s: Because that's a lot of traders.
2457.04s: We hire a lot of traders.
2458.56s: Yeah.
2459.08s: Yeah.
2459.40s: Which I mean, that's one of my favorite things about traders is that there's traders
2462.84s: from essentially every background you can think of.
2465.28s: But there is immediately.
2466.32s: Oh, yeah.
2466.80s: Yeah.
2466.96s: Yeah.
2467.48s: Yeah.
2467.96s: Yeah.
2468.24s: We, we, you know, over the years, we, we, it was very difficult.
2475.40s: It was almost impossible to know who is going to be a good trader and who, you know, now it's easy.
2480.36s: Because now, now it all comes down to, it's much more mechanical.
2485.40s: It's much more all about smarts.
2487.48s: So now it, now it's a function of, you know, smarts and math and, and you're just a ability to just make all the numbers make sense.
2499.12s: But back then it wasn't back then it was very physical.
2503.68s: And it was very different and it was much more mental game theory, you know, just lots of different things involved compared to today.
2513.12s: So everything has has completely shifted today.
2517.04s: Today it's today, anybody's, everything's equal.
2520.08s: Back then it was not the case.
2522.08s: Right.
2523.28s: Speaking of today, when you look at like new traders and the problem set that's in front of them, if you take a brand new trader from today versus 30 years ago, specifically focusing on today, what, like what are they trying to solve for as far as you can tell?
2542.04s: Like if you're talking to a brand new trader that's saying, I want to trade.
2546.04s: What's the direction you send them down?
2548.44s: I don't know that I'm not sure what they're trying to solve for.
2553.80s: I mean, different people have different reasons for wanting to learn to trade.
2560.20s: For some people, it's obviously that it's, it's new, it's intriguing, it's exciting.
2565.96s: For others, they, they've reached a point where they want to learn how to manage their.
2571.88s: Through trading, they can learn, you can learn more faster.
2576.52s: Through trading than you can any other way.
2578.32s: As a past investor, you know, it takes you 50 years.
2581.24s: There's, that makes no sense.
2583.00s: So as a trader, you can accelerate your learning process by, you know, 100 X.
2588.88s: So some people do it for that.
2591.56s: Other people figure out that, that it's really helpful for decision making and, and really helpful for, you know, it makes them much
2601.60s: stronger in every other aspect of their life, risk assessment, probabilistic assessment, statistics, probabilities, you know, strategy, all the above.
2611.60s: So I think there's, there's different reasons why different people choose to be traders or choose to trade.
2620.60s: For some people, it's a compliment to for other people.
2623.08s: It's a time suck, which is all good.
2626.56s: You know, I mean, there's a lot of, when you think about your life, there's an incorrect people have, you know, people have the ability to waste an enormous amount of time, you know, just between watching Netflix and you can go down a Netflix rabbit hole, you can go down an Amazon rabbit hole, a YouTube rabbit hole, you go down easily down a TikTok rabbit hole, you know, and you can, there's lots of other things, you know, you can do to.
2655.56s: I wish I had back, you know, the, the, the two, three years of my life, which are probably equal, you know, walking around a golf course, you know, trying to take money for my friends, you know, like I like to have that time back, you know, so, so I think that.
2671.56s: One of the things that I've learned from trading over the years is that it's made me into a very successful entrepreneur, because it's taught me a lot of things about, you know, differentiation, articulation, you know, how my brain is, is, I make very fast decisions, they're not always right.
2695.56s: But you know, I can make a decision before you finish asking the question, and so that's, you know, throughout the years, most of the successful entrepreneurs that I've run into are incredibly fast decision makers, like they, they, they, they don't listen very well, but they make really good decisions.
2714.56s: People that listen, drive me crazy, because, because, because listeners are not traders, traders, like, and they'll tell you six different people are telling six different stories simultaneously, and somehow you're picking up all bits and pieces of each, each story.
2731.56s: So I, I'm not a really big fan of listeners, you know, I like people that don't listen.
2738.56s: I could see why though, because listening in that context is really passive. So, I should make a t-shirt that says that I like people that don't listen.
2748.56s: I love that. Yeah, it's very on brand too.
2754.56s: And then if you think about new traders then in this context of being able to make quick decisions, but there's a bit of a paradox here, right, because most new traders limited capital, and there's just a million stupid mistakes you can make early on to lose your trading capital to start.
2774.56s: How do you strike a balance there, do you think?
2776.56s: It's really hard. You go, that's why we preach the whole trade small trade often, because you have to create enough occurrences in order to learn, and you have to create enough occurrences in order to create a predictable outcome.
2792.56s: It's the whole law of large numbers. It's absolutely in play in the trading world.
2796.56s: But the other side to it is that people are emotional, people are egotistical, people are stubborn, people are very undisciplined, people like to think that they have, you know, embedded inside everybody is this crazy gambler's policy, which, you know, which is, which is really hard to get around if you've never traded.
2820.56s: So because there's, you don't have enough places in your life where you could experience that kind of, you know, that kind of decision making, or the need for that kind of decision making.
2830.56s: So there's all these issues, and I think you get around those through trading, if you can get to that point, you know, it's hard, it's hard. Even on the trading floors, you know, there was a 95% failure rate.
2844.56s: And that's with edge, you know, in the retail world, it's probably, you know, I think it's, it's, it's a much flatter world now and the fees are a lot less. So, so it's, the success rates higher, but it's not high enough.
2858.56s: Yeah, so if you're talking to a new trader, what tips do you give them to drive that success up trade small straight off and one of them, obviously, beyond that.
2869.56s: Yeah, the whole concept of trade small trade off is great. The two that I really think are important.
2875.56s: And again, the, I can't emphasize enough the trading small piece, because that was the hardest hurdle for us to get over.
2885.56s: The next two would be stay, stay in the most liquid underlines there are like just make sure liquidity is your friend.
2896.56s: So make sure you stay in liquid underlines. And then I really believe strongly like it's, it's over the top on this that you have to manage stuff early.
2907.56s: You cannot let stuff go to where the, the end of a cycle can, can wipe out a single trade. You have to manage trades early, you reduce risk, you reduce the volatility, your own volatility and you reduce your risk so dramatically you essentially eliminate your outlier risk.
2926.56s: And the one thing that kills people is outlier risk.
2930.56s: Now, something I saw somebody mentioned in a comment somewhere on this exact thread where the idea of managing early, they are curious and I thought it was a good idea.
2940.56s: I obviously have a bunch of thoughts on it, but I want to hear yours, which are if the general thesis 45 days manage about 21.
2950.56s: And as we get within 21, a lot of these other things come out of the woodwork, their question was well, then why isn't it at 21? Why don't you just inverse take the other side?
2964.56s: It's a fair question.
2966.56s: But it's not, it's not, but, but it's an easy answer.
2969.56s: Exactly.
2970.56s: It's not because the odds change at 21 days. It's has nothing to do with that. It's that it's the magnitude of the, it's a magnitude of the change in the decay curve where you end up taking so much more risk.
2990.56s: So what that means is the reason you don't flip the cards over is if you put a trade on at 45 days and you let it go, let's just say as an example and you let it go to expiration.
3000.56s: And let's say your chance of success is 65%. Then in the end, if you do enough times, it's going to be 65%.
3007.56s: If you put the same trade on at 45 days and you take it off at 21 days, your probability success is still going to be 65%.
3016.56s: So there's no difference. You're 65%. If you take it off at 21 days and you're 65% in the end, if you hold it all the way to the end, the difference is that the dollars you make per day between 45 and 21 are about 35% more per day, your P and L per day.
3035.56s: Then if you hold it from 45 to zero. So the reason you take it off is not to flip the cards over. It's because the amount of money you make on a dollars per day for taking the same amount of risk is significantly greater.
3049.56s: And that's why it is the optimal point in the decay curve.
3053.56s: Got it. And you mentioned an important part there of risk adjusted basis, correct? Because obviously theta would accelerate as we get within that course.
3062.56s: So as you get inside of 21 days, you are going to have some time when that when when those positions are going to, you know, they're going to be unbelievable.
3069.56s: They're going to work in your favor and you're going to have other times when when your losses, you know, it's just the speed at which your positions move at that point.
3077.56s: And it gets to be much more difficult to control. You know, as you get close to expiration, it's very hard to control delta.
3084.56s: When you have time to go, it's very easy to control delta. And that's the difference.
3088.56s: Like imagine a day like today, you could not control.
3093.56s: You know, if you had a, if you had a daily option on today, you're dead. If you had a weekly option on today, you're dead.
3099.56s: You could not control your risk in the zero days. The one days or the three days today, you know, or the seven days in the 45 days, it was challenging, but you could do it.
3110.56s: But in the weeklies, you couldn't even possibly you had no chance. You're buried.
3115.56s: Can confirm that whole little buried thesis looks real accurate on the zero DTE SPX stuff today that's. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
3124.56s: So, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
3154.56s: you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, You know, it's just very helpful for you.
3170.56s: So, that's really, it's just really urgent, I think you know, everything that you have place using.
3175.90s: what are the things you want to focus on?
3177.62s: And for how long, that's the second part's important.
3182.26s: Can you say how long, do you mean like,
3184.50s: how long should it take?
3186.82s: Not necessarily how long it should take,
3188.66s: but how long they could expect to spend
3191.22s: like truly focusing on this thing
3193.38s: before they feel really familiar with it.
3199.62s: You know, it's funny.
3202.06s: When I first started in this business
3204.42s: and everything was, you know, the old school open outcry by hand.
3209.50s: That's crazy.
3210.94s: The shortest period of time it took was a year,
3213.30s: but for most people it took, you know, two or three years.
3216.98s: And I know because we had a prop firm, we backed a lot of people.
3219.62s: It was almost impossible to ramp anybody up in a short period of time.
3223.30s: One to two years minimum.
3226.78s: Nowadays, it's very different because the playing feels level,
3230.94s: the technology's great.
3232.82s: The fee struck, the fees are commoditized.
3236.10s: The markets are incredibly liquid.
3239.62s: You know, there's a penny wide markets for everything.
3241.90s: I would say that the fascinating thing today is that you can essentially,
3250.42s: if you are able to stay small enough and make enough small trades,
3255.50s: you can ramp up in, you know, 30 to 60 days.
3259.78s: And you can be very confident in your understanding of what's going on.
3264.74s: Doesn't mean you making money, but I think you need to go through one full 45 day cycle.
3271.66s: And, you know, and then whatever adjustments and everything happens.
3274.46s: So, so, you know, 30 to 45 days to get 30 to 60 days in a 45 day cycle in there
3281.42s: to really make enough introductory trades to get your feet wet and to get comfortable.
3288.86s: I don't think you can turn the corner that quickly.
3291.06s: I think that takes longer, but I think you can get to the point where,
3295.30s: okay, I dig this, you know, this is fun stuff.
3299.42s: I see what you mean there.
3300.42s: And I think one of the parts like to me, as I hear you say that,
3305.34s: I think that's really quick.
3307.38s: But I also imagine that's not that's not a profitability.
3311.22s: That's just to engagement.
3313.90s: Right.
3314.66s: Yeah.
3314.90s: And that makes sense to me because the other thing I find anyways,
3317.78s: is just a difference now with people and how much,
3322.14s: what guardrails are expected, right?
3324.22s: I find people in my generation and younger,
3326.86s: they like, there's a lot of guardrails that kind of are expected.
3331.34s: Whereas my guess is the way you analyze it is probably people making a concerted
3336.18s: effort and actually like truly applying themselves, which, yeah, I could say that.
3340.70s: Yeah. I mean, if you're talking about like just stock investing, you know,
3344.26s: I mean, that there's nothing to that.
3346.46s: That's a monkey can do that.
3347.90s: And if you're talking about like, if you're talking about like, you know,
3351.78s: digital asset, like Bitcoin or eth investing or, you know, cryptocurrencies,
3356.26s: I mean, that's again, that's also brain dead stuff.
3359.70s: There's nothing to it.
3360.66s: You know, it's like, you choose what you want to buy and you buy it.
3363.22s: You hope it goes higher.
3363.98s: I mean, you're not, there's no, nothing rocket science about that.
3367.14s: We're talking about a much more complex game of, you know, options and derivatives.
3372.66s: And I mean, now if you were doing like, you know, if you were doing, you know,
3376.70s: crypto swaps, if you're, you know, if you're doing crypto swaps and things like that,
3381.46s: you know, that's that's a whole different game, you know, if you're, if you're
3384.26s: staking and you're doing, you know, just getting into the more complex aspects of the
3388.18s: business, you know, that you can take a little bit longer to figure everything out.
3392.74s: If you're just buying stocks, okay, great.
3395.82s: If you're buying stock selling calls against it or, you know, selling stock selling
3399.74s: puts or doing something, you know, shorting puts to get long stock, you know, all
3404.18s: that stuff's way more, you know, takes a little bit longer.
3407.34s: And then when you get into options, strategies, it takes a little bit longer.
3411.22s: I see.
3412.06s: What strategies would you focus on?
3414.62s: Like would you focus somebody on for their first, you know, 45 day cycle,
3419.10s: and maybe like the first three, six months?
3420.94s: It depends on, you know, on a, it depends on the amount of capital.
3425.18s: I mean, if it's somebody with a reasonable amount of capital and they, they're
3428.46s: comfortable with covered calls or cash secured boots or short puts.
3432.02s: I mean, that's where I would start because I like the high probability of success in
3436.06s: what in those cases, you know, a short out of the money put has, you know, up to an 80%
3440.38s: probability profit.
3441.18s: I like that covered call, maybe 65 to 67% probability profit.
3446.78s: I like that.
3448.26s: If you want to do a vertical spread, that would be for the people that have less capital,
3452.70s: you know, risk to find credit spread or debit spread, lower probability of profit.
3457.74s: Maybe it's 50, 50, maybe it's, you know, 60, 40, but a good way to get your feet wet,
3463.58s: you know, just depends on your capital, you know, the amount of capital you have.
3467.42s: Unfortunately, the trading world capital does matter.
3471.34s: Of course.
3472.06s: And what would you say minimum starting capital versus optimal starting capital?
3479.26s: Optimal starting capital would be $25,000 plus.
3482.94s: I mean, optimal would be 100, but, you know, 50 to 100 in that range, decent size account,
3488.94s: minimum 25 in for in the optimal world, minimum 25, so you don't have to deal with pattern
3493.90s: day trading rules.
3495.66s: But any amount like if you're 21 years old and you're starting with, you know, $2,000,
3502.54s: you need 2000 because that's the minimum for have a margin account to allow you to do complex
3507.26s: spreads. But even if you have $2,000, that's totally great to get started with.
3513.98s: I mean, most people that have $2,000 to trade with also have $2,000 to go to Vegas with,
3519.10s: and your chances of learning a lot more through trading than going to Vegas is about, is about,
3523.74s: you know, 10X. So yeah, I'm pretty confident that with $2,000, you might not make money,
3530.70s: but you're going to learn a crap load and you're going to be infinitely better off as in every
3538.06s: aspect of your life. So it sounds like in I love that you make that distinction. It sounds like
3544.22s: what you're messaging there is if you're starting with a really small amount of money,
3548.06s: $2,000 in this case, focus on what you're learning, not necessarily turning this 2000 into $2,000.
3554.78s: I mean, people have this crazy, you know, you have this idea that somewhere, some place,
3562.86s: one time, somebody turned $2,000 into $100,000 into a million into $10,000,000, whatever. Okay,
3569.58s: that's, you know, somebody also bought a lottery ticket for $5,000, you know, what a hand,
3574.22s: put 10 lottery tickets for $5 or five lottery tickets for $5,000, and ended up winning, you know,
3579.58s: a couple hundred million. Yeah, sure, it's happened, but or or not. Next to Jordan,
3584.54s: courtside, that too. Yeah, whatever. Well, that was more calculated. We call that strategic.
3590.70s: But the reality is that, that, you know, what you'd like to do with $2,000 is, you know,
3597.10s: ideally is to turn it into $3,000, and in the same time, learn everything there is to know. So
3604.54s: when you start to acquire wealth, you have all the optionality in your fingertips.
3610.54s: Right. Last question before we wrap up, how do you guide people to make that kind of distinction
3617.50s: in their mind? Because I think most people that start with a small amount of money, their expectation
3622.62s: is they're going to turn it into a large amount of money. So then when they hear something like that,
3626.86s: where it's focused on the learning, they're probably, yeah, whatever, bro, I'm just going to turn
3631.66s: this into a lot of money. Yeah, sure. Well, I mean, you know, that's the gamblers dream. You
3637.90s: know, I mean, there's so many people that go to Vegas that think they're going to go there with
3641.74s: $1,000 and turn it into $10,000. But, you know, most of those people usually end up walking to the
3646.94s: airport. I mean, you know, that's the, you know, that's when you see somebody walking to McHare and
3655.58s: they're on the side of the road and they're walking. It's hot out. You're like, oh, man, I've seen

3671.50s: time. Talk to literally millions of people and traded my entire adult life from 20, you know,
3678.78s: from 40 some odd years I haven't stopped trading. Like I said, I made like 125 trades today. I don't
3685.82s: I'm a junkie and I don't have any of these crazy ideas that, you know, I'm supposed to do like,
3694.38s: I'm supposed to turn this amount of money into this amount of money. You know, I just like it every
3698.86s: time I make a winning trade. I don't care today if it's a dollar or $100,000. I still love making winning
3704.54s: trades. That's awesome. Tom, I always enjoy chat with you. It's really cool. Thanks for sharing a lot
3711.74s: of other stories. It's really fun hearing more about the stuff you've done. It's very cool.
