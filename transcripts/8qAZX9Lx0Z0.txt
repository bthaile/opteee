0.00s: What's up to all the outliers, Eric here.
2.50s: I got a video for you today on the ratio diagonal option strategy that I run very frequently.
9.66s: You will also hear me refer to it as the call leaps diagonal, because I do trade it to the
14.72s: call side more often than the put side.
17.34s: And leaps are very commonly a part of the equation, but not always.
21.10s: So I have a series that's actually really in depth on this.
25.46s: My goal for this video is to provide a 65 to 70% level of depth overview, however, in
33.32s: one video.
34.32s: So I'm looking to pack a lot of information into this one video.
38.80s: So it's easier for people to find the strategy because it is one of my favorites.
42.96s: So let's do a quick overview of what is a diagonal in general, and then what is the
49.92s: ratio diagonal.
52.04s: So in short, a diagonal is very, very similar to a covered call.
57.98s: And the main difference is instead of using long stock, you use long calls.
64.88s: That's pretty much it.
66.44s: So it's also similar to a calendar in that it's typically across different explorations.
73.00s: However, it's different than a calendar because it's not typically at the same strike
78.12s: for the long call to short call.
80.26s: So quick synopsis, the ratio diagonal has two parts, a long call and a short call.
86.90s: Typically, the long call will be further out in time.
89.58s: The short call will be nearer in time, although it doesn't have to be that way.
94.30s: And then the big difference in the way that I traded as introduced to me by my mentor,
100.98s: the guy that I reference very frequently, I bring it up simply because this trade was
105.06s: not my idea.
106.22s: It's it's his.
107.62s: And I'm not going to take credit for it.
109.18s: I do have my own tweaks to the strategy, but it is not my own.
113.38s: So anyways, with that out of the way, the main reason why trading it, I like to trade
118.70s: it at a ratio is it has a very different and in my opinion, more advantageous risk reward
125.82s: profile.
126.82s: So let's take a look at what a normal diagonal looks like.
129.62s: We're going to be looking at VLO.
130.98s: This is actually what I'm going to run an example back and forth as we go through the
135.26s: content because I actually recently put a trade on in VLO leveraging the strategy.
141.74s: So thought it was a good fit.
143.54s: Okay.
144.74s: So first, let's take a look at the risk profile.
149.38s: This is what a normal or typical diagonal will look like.
154.30s: We have risk to the downside.
156.30s: The max risk to the downside will be the debit you've paid.
160.66s: And then we see this kind of triangle shape where our max profit is.
166.54s: And then if it starts moving up too far, then we actually start to have upside risk.
172.62s: And what's happening here is the long call delta is being overwhelmed by the expanding
181.26s: short call delta.
183.86s: That's all it is.
184.86s: But that's where your upside risk comes from in a typical diagonal.
189.70s: Now this is kind of my take on the diagonal.
194.22s: And you'll see it is a very different risk reward profile.
198.78s: Namely, if we keep going to the right, you'll notice that there's no max upside and there's
205.58s: no upside risk whatsoever.
207.42s: I only have risk to the downside.
210.06s: So similar to the traditional diagonal, my downside risk is going to be capped to the
216.14s: debit I pay to enter the position.
219.22s: Now the reason why I have this upside or this upward sloping angle is I am selling the
228.06s: short calls at a ratio to the long calls.
232.34s: So what you see down here is an actual trade that I had on and I had six long calls, but
238.42s: only three short calls.
241.54s: And we'll get into the different kinds we can structure the ratios in a little bit.
245.02s: But suffice it to say at least for the example that if we have your short calls, then our
251.86s: long calls, we can eliminate upside risk and we can also uncap it so that it's unlimited.
259.54s: Now there's some caveats to that in terms of where we place the short call in relation
264.66s: to the long call and things like that.
266.18s: We'll get into a little bit of that detail in a little bit.
269.90s: But that's the general idea here by trading the short at a ratio to a long, we get rid
277.66s: of this scenario.
278.98s: We appreciate to the upside very similar to a covered call, but it's even like doing
285.38s: a ratio covered call where we have more long stock than the short calls we're selling
289.58s: against it.
290.86s: So this is the breakdown.
293.66s: Now let's get over here and start getting into detail.
297.66s: Now it's going to look a little wordy on the screen.
299.86s: I have a lot of talking notes, but don't worry.
302.26s: I will be flipping back and directing your attention where it should be.
305.70s: So let's get right to it.
306.98s: So as for any strategy, I like to have a couple buckets that I outline.
312.38s: This is again my preferred approach for outlining strategies called a strategy outline.
318.66s: They're kind of individual sections that fit into my broader trading plan.
322.14s: So these are excerpts from my strategy outline for you all.
326.50s: And I'm always going to start with the executive summary, get into the setup, how we're actually
330.38s: going to set this trade up, the management of the trade, and then I'm also going to run
333.50s: you through some tips and tricks throughout the video.
336.02s: Okay, so let's talk about the setup.
338.46s: We already talked about the executive summary of what the strategy is.
341.78s: So for the setup, essentially, we're going to be applying whatever long stock analysis criteria,
348.94s: you typically apply to your long stock positions.
353.74s: Now the criteria and the analysis is going to differ by timeframe because for the long
361.42s: call side of the trade, which is kind of like the base of the trade, I go anywhere from
366.90s: 90 days to expiration out to the max allowable.
371.98s: In the case with VLO, you'll notice that I was out to 20 Jan 23.
378.22s: So if we pull up the option chain, you can see that that was 257 days out.
384.22s: There's a couple ways you can think about the days to expiration.
387.82s: The longer days you give the trade, the lower your theta decay is going to be regardless
394.66s: of the delta, but the delta will amplify how much we can reduce the theta decay.
400.14s: So that's the first thing.
401.38s: The second thing is you give the trade more time to work instead of having to be right
406.12s: in 90 days, we can be right in 200 plus days.
410.68s: Now the downside, it's more expensive.
413.76s: So again, using this example, when I entered the trade, it was trading around $31 or something
419.24s: like that.
420.64s: If I look at it now, let's just use the current price.
423.76s: So it's easier right now, the 80 in the 80 call that's deep in the money right now,
431.12s: it's at 87 delta again.
432.72s: Well, don't worry too much about those details yet.
434.68s: We'll get to it.
435.68s: Just want to talk about the price.
437.20s: Right now it's trading for call at 51 30.
439.92s: If I look at something that's expiring 131 days out, again, let's look at that same 87
447.72s: delta, which would be the 95 call in this case, that's trading for 30, you know, $6.
454.72s: So you get the point.
456.16s: It's much more expensive the further out in time you go, especially because I like to trade
460.00s: these deep in the money, which is really the next point here.
464.64s: There's a few reasons why I like to trade them deep in the money, meaning an 80 delta
468.48s: plus.
469.48s: I'm going to lower the theta decay as I mentioned, because as you all should know, theta
474.92s: decay is the highest for at the money options.
479.32s: And it obviously accelerates as we get closer to expiration.
482.16s: So we're doing two things to decrease the theta decay.
485.64s: We're going far out in time.
487.80s: And then we are also going deep in the money.
490.40s: And if we take a look at the theta decay, it's less than a penny a day, essentially,
496.40s: it's so far in the money what happens is thinkorswomen actually has an issue calculating it.
501.20s: So as you can see out here, it's two cents a day, two cents a day, one cent a day.
505.00s: This isn't two cents a day.
506.16s: This will be under under a penny or a penny and change.
511.92s: So there's two things we're doing to really limit the theta decay.
515.20s: We also experience lower Vega, which is also important because depending on how we structure
521.28s: the strategy, although change in volatility might be helpful to us, we don't want it hurting
526.12s: us.
527.12s: So it assists with that as well.
529.76s: And then the last thing is by going with the higher delta, we enjoy more of a move of
535.08s: the underlying because again, if we're buying an 80 delta call for every $1 option, for
541.92s: every $1 move in the underlying, those options are going to move by 80 cents, all things being
546.88s: equal.
547.88s: So that's super important for this strategy to make money for us.
552.76s: If you go really far out of the money, you might be able to again, appreciate more compounding
560.16s: of your debit pay to entry, but you're not going to make the same gross number of dollars.
566.20s: So that's why I like to go with a higher delta.
568.68s: It's going to lower our theta lower Vega and then we're going to enjoy more of a move
572.48s: in the underlying.
573.48s: Okay, so let's move on to just some of the background of the trade.
578.24s: Max profit technically should be undefined.
580.88s: There are instances where if we sell at a 1 to 1 ratio, we might have a defined upside
586.68s: trade.
587.68s: So for example, if I start adding more short calls in this hypothetical scenario and I
591.92s: go six to six.
594.36s: So this means one to one.
595.44s: I have six long six shorts.
598.08s: Notice how we still have that kind of peak that you saw in the other more traditional diagonal,
603.36s: but there's still no upside risk.
605.44s: It's just capped now, meaning we can't make more in more money essentially anything above
612.32s: 148 on.
614.32s: So that is a scenario where we could have capped upside risk, which would be somewhere
621.96s: around the short call.
624.24s: But in general, it should be undefined if we're structuring it.
627.68s: First loss is going to be your debit paid and that's going to be at expiration.
631.72s: There's two things that we're looking for.
633.48s: This is the primary thing.
634.64s: We want the stock to go up in price.
636.76s: We're trading this just like a covered call.
638.80s: Ideal scenario is the underlying blows through our short calls and we're seeing a loss
645.64s: on those short calls.
646.96s: That's perfect scenario.
648.64s: A lot of people get really confused about that with covered calls thinking, oh, I wanted
652.32s: to be below my short strike or before below the short call.
656.60s: And it's a misconception.
658.08s: It's just a mental block because they don't want to have a trade that's technically a
663.12s: part of the trade that's technically losing.
664.88s: But Max Profit rest assured is the higher it goes.
669.08s: And then the other scenario that does help the strategy is if implied volatility expands.
674.92s: Now again, we're going to be we're going to experience less in sensitivity to it because
679.84s: of the way we structure the trade to reduce Vega.
681.88s: But nonetheless, if we go from IV percentile that's 10 and it goes to 60, your leaps will
688.92s: appreciate somewhat in value.
691.28s: So that is the other scenario.
693.12s: So one of the first hurdles I'm going to be looking for when I'm looking for this trade
698.56s: is I want to see something that I'm bullish in.
701.88s: And if you need some ideas on how I like to apply fundamental technical analysis, I have
706.72s: a whole playlist on it.
707.72s: So feel free to go check that out because I'm not going to go super far in a detail in
712.56s: the interest of your time.
714.72s: But anyways, that's from a technical standpoint.
717.40s: But I'm also going to look for implied volatility ideally to be a little bit lower so that
721.44s: I have the exposure to enjoy if implied volatility actually expands that helps the position.
729.76s: Okay.
730.76s: So let's talk through really the four main steps to entering this trade.
734.12s: And then I'm going to give you some detail on all of these.
736.12s: In the meantime, I am going to throw out some of these tips and tricks so that we can
741.00s: kind of talk about it as we go.
743.12s: Now one of the things that I do want to talk about upfront is this right here, the ratio
748.76s: trade off.
750.12s: So when we're structuring this trade, there's a couple ways to look at it.
754.56s: If I buy sex and sell three, I'm going to make a certain amount of money.
761.56s: If I sell six against my long six, the amount of money I'm going to make upfront increases
770.92s: because instead of getting three credits for whatever the premium is of the option, I'm
776.48s: going to get six of them.
778.16s: So it's super important to think about the trade off here.
782.00s: If you sell more short calls against the longs, you're going to collect more money up front
788.28s: and you're going to give away upside potential.
792.00s: And then the inverse is true.
793.60s: If you sell fewer short calls, you're going to collect less money upfront and give up less
800.60s: upside potential.
802.36s: So you can apply that thought process throughout the life cycle of the trade.
806.00s: If you want to wait collecting more money upfront, then sell more or sell more aggressively
811.12s: closer to the money or your basis.
813.32s: If that's not the case, then consider selling less so that you can enjoy more of the upside.
818.12s: Totally up to you.
819.64s: So it's important to think about the trade off early.
823.72s: Another super important part of the setup is liquidity.
828.24s: It is so important to check the liquidity, especially on the long calls or puts the further
835.92s: out in time you go.
837.48s: So one of my favorite ways to do that is to check out the bit ask spread as well as the
841.32s: open interest.
842.80s: So if you'll notice here, the open interest, there's 1800 contracts, which is pretty
847.76s: deep.
849.08s: And for something that's 250, 7 days out, there's a 60 cent wide bit ask spread that is
855.16s: very liquid, especially for something that's $130.
859.60s: This is so important to check because if you find something, let's say if it was the
864.00s: same trade, VLO, same everything, but this was $10 wide, big problem.
871.32s: Same thing if we look at some of the shallow open interest strikes, right?
877.80s: So if I look at this 35 call, there's eight of them.
881.80s: And if I look at the 30 call, there's four of them.
884.12s: And then if we look at the 25, there's zero.
887.00s: So liquidity can absolutely become an issue.
890.48s: Trading liquid underlines is super important for the strategy because otherwise you might
895.16s: be able to worm your way into the strategy, but you can get stuck pretty bad.
899.92s: If you can't exit the trade for a profit, even if it's showing a good profit, you might
904.24s: not be able to get out.
905.56s: So liquidity is so important here.
908.08s: The other thing is the products that you're trading.
909.96s: Again, I'm not going to go super far in a product selection, but in general, I'm going
914.16s: to be looking at index ETFs, sector ETFs, S&P 500 stocks, things like that.
920.40s: I absolutely will trade this in more speculative products as well.
924.76s: It's not limited to those.
926.36s: But the reason why I bring that up is especially for applying the leaps side of things, meaning
931.04s: we're going really far out in time.
933.04s: I want it to be something I'm comfortable holding for a long period of time.
936.96s: All right.
937.96s: With all of that, let's talk about the actual steps to setting this trade up.
943.40s: First off, portfolio review and allocate.
945.92s: This is what I do for every single trade.
947.52s: I'm going to look at the portfolio, see what I need, see what gaps I have, and then also
951.88s: to gain some information in terms of where I can add risk, where I can't, things like
955.72s: that.
956.84s: Then I'm going to allocate what this means is I am going to set aside a certain amount
961.68s: of money for my portfolio that I'm going to apply to this trade.
965.48s: So for this specific trade in VLO, I'll even show you the little Excel sheet that I have
970.48s: here.
971.48s: I was setting aside $25,000 for that trade.
974.76s: I do that up front to avoid any conflict of emotional interest over the life cycle of
980.40s: the trade.
981.40s: I like to do it before the trade is on when my mind is very clear.
984.88s: That I have found to be a great practice.
988.08s: And then the outlay.
989.60s: So this is what I'm going to initially offer the trade.
993.52s: That's my initial outlay.
995.92s: So again, using the current example in VLO, I allocated $25,000.
1002.96s: The initial outlay was $19,020.
1006.96s: So I used 76% of my allocation for the trade.
1012.20s: And what I allow for that varies over time.
1015.12s: But again, for the sake of this conversation, it's just super important to differentiate
1020.20s: between what you're offering to the trade, what the outlay is.
1023.72s: The reason why I like to break it up that way is because it allows me to scale into the
1027.80s: trade over the life cycle of the trade.
1029.80s: Meaning if it goes in my favor or against me, I will evaluate the product and look at
1034.76s: committing more capital.
1036.60s: If it's moving against me and I add a little bit more risk, it's a good way to manage
1041.52s: my basis.
1042.88s: Same thing to the upside.
1043.88s: If I'm getting a move in my favor and I add a little bit of risk that can actually
1048.48s: help me a lot by keeping my overall basis a little bit lower while I gain more exposure.
1054.56s: So what I typically use for that is around a 5% move.
1057.76s: I'm going to take a look at it and then decide do I want to scale in more or not?
1063.08s: Simple as that.
1064.96s: So now that we have the allocation set aside for the trade, we're going to figure out we
1070.64s: might have already had the trade identified what product we wanted to enter.
1075.00s: But then we're going to apply our screens to it.
1077.92s: So again, checking things like that liquidity.
1080.84s: I'm also going to apply my typical technical analysis, fundamental analysis for a bullish
1085.80s: trade.
1086.88s: So I'm going to look at moving averages across different time frames.
1090.08s: The time frames should correspond to what I'm looking at.
1093.64s: So for example, in this VLO trade since I was 257 days out, I started pretty far out
1100.64s: and I zoomed in.
1101.96s: So I actually started with the two year daily to get a broader sense of it, zoomed in
1106.44s: to a one year to again, make sure that I'm still in an upward sloping linear regression
1110.96s: channels.
1111.96s: The moving averages were aligned as I wanted them earnings was looking good quarter over
1116.76s: quarter, all of those sorts of things.
1119.96s: So when all that's done, you decide that this is a good product for you.
1123.64s: You like it.
1124.64s: Then we got a structure of the trade.
1126.20s: So we're going to look at the long side first and then the short side for the long side,
1131.24s: you got to pick what days to expiration you want to run, what delta you're going to
1135.24s: use, which is typically easy, zero point a zero or higher.
1139.00s: And then what size?
1140.00s: And again, even this is pretty easy based on your allocation and then how you want to
1144.32s: consider your initial outlay.
1146.08s: I typically don't like using more than 80% of the allocation on the initial outlay.
1151.64s: A lot more times is closer to 50%, but it depends on what I'm trading and what I'm thinking.
1156.88s: That's just to give you some ideas.
1159.04s: And then for the short, I do like to keep that shorter, days to expiration than the long.
1164.84s: So my long, typically in the shortest scenario would be 90 days out.
1169.60s: And that's rare.
1170.60s: Normally it's six months at least.
1172.28s: That's a common time for him.
1173.48s: Six months to a year and change.
1176.04s: The short will be 20 to 40 days to expiration.
1178.44s: This is so that I can kind of turn them out and do my best to stay sensitive to theta
1183.32s: decay because shorter days to expiration, the theta decay curve accelerates.
1189.48s: And another important note is that on the first entry sale of those short calls when
1195.52s: you first get into the trade, that's when you're going to make your most money on the
1199.60s: short calls because typically the market's going to start moving and then you don't have
1203.52s: as much fidelity.
1205.04s: So I typically like that 20 to 40 days.
1207.76s: It's a sweet spot.
1209.52s: And then the other thing to keep in mind, we talked about this ratio before what I like
1214.78s: to do is maintain a specific delta ratio.
1218.32s: So the delta ratio is a way for me to make sure that I'm not experiencing upside risk
1224.28s: and uncapping my upside.
1226.72s: So to figure out your delta ratio, you just take the number of long calls that you have,
1231.36s: multiplied by your delta, divide that by 2.1 times your short call delta.
1238.24s: So this is just making sure that you have enough long delta to overwhelm the short call
1243.52s: delta.
1244.64s: So again, in this example, if we go to the risk profile, you'll see that I have a maximum
1251.76s: of long 600 delta.
1254.48s: I have a maximum of short 300 delta.
1257.68s: I have 300 excess delta.
1260.48s: That's how I know I have no upside risk and I have no kept upside.
1264.12s: This is just a simple way to keep that kind of top of mind easy to think about.
1270.64s: And I use a calculator for it.
1273.36s: So that's exactly how I figure this figure out right here is by using that delta ratio.
1281.52s: So let's talk about the final details here.
1286.88s: Building a sheet entering the trade.
1288.52s: Again, I showed you my Excel sheet, the other more in depth video I have on this will go
1293.28s: into detail on the Excel sheet.
1295.00s: So I'm not going to spend a ton of time on it.
1297.96s: But then let's talk about managing this trade.
1301.12s: So there's a couple of scenarios that happen in the lifecycle of the trade.
1305.16s: We can have the stock trends sideways.
1308.28s: So one scenario.
1310.16s: We can have a scenario where our short call falls in the money and we can have a scenario
1315.32s: where the stock drops.
1317.32s: Creating our short call would be out of the money and potentially even even our long call
1321.40s: in a worst case scenario.
1323.32s: So let's start with the first.
1324.48s: This is easy.
1325.40s: The stock goes sideways.
1327.32s: Depending on where your short call is, you're just going to harvest it.
1330.32s: You're going to wait until it's about 70% Max profit.
1332.72s: That's what I like to take out of it and take the trade off.
1337.12s: If these short call falls in the money, there's two things you can do.
1341.42s: The easiest one is to close the entire trade at a profit.
1344.96s: actually what I did in VLO.
1347.32s: I had a pretty big rally in the underlying
1350.04s: short calls were in the money.
1351.60s: I just took the whole thing off.
1353.28s: Now, really important note,
1355.08s: when you do choose to take the whole trade off,
1357.68s: I typically like to kind of volley back and forth.
1360.84s: What I mean by that is I will sell one
1364.84s: of the long dated options.
1366.84s: I'm gauging market liquidity
1369.28s: without offering myself upside risk
1371.96s: because what you don't wanna do
1373.76s: is enter or I'm sorry,
1375.28s: exit all of your long calls,
1377.28s: then you have naked short calls.
1378.96s: That's a market risk.
1380.16s: If for whatever reason at that exact moment
1383.24s: or right around that time,
1384.76s: the underlying just runs away.
1386.76s: This is stupid risk to take.
1388.48s: So I like to exit with one of the long dated calls,
1392.28s: find the market,
1393.44s: make sure I'm okay,
1394.32s: exiting at that price.
1395.96s: Then I will exit all of the short calls at once.
1399.72s: And then I will go back to the long calls
1402.04s: and exit the rest of those.
1403.64s: Accepting the fact that there might be a little slippage
1405.84s: in the time it takes me to do that.
1407.68s: But I find that that to be a really efficient way
1411.12s: to get out of the trade with really no risk
1414.24s: because that scenario outlined,
1416.44s: although not likely it could happen.
1419.68s: And how angry would you be if you entered all of your longs,
1423.80s: you get this big rally all of a sudden
1426.12s: and now you have a huge loss
1428.04s: that was completely avoidable.
1429.88s: I don't wanna go through that flow,
1432.40s: so I don't do it.
1434.32s: Now, slightly more complicated scenario
1437.64s: is if you choose to sell,
1441.96s: close your short calls at a debit,
1444.40s: then what I like to use is the long calls to cover the cost.
1448.72s: So what I mean by that is if I have short calls
1452.16s: that are in the money,
1453.08s: I'm gonna figure out the debit to close those short calls.
1457.52s: Then I'm gonna look at and see how many long calls
1461.40s: I need to sell in order to cover the cost for those short calls
1466.48s: because what's gonna be happening in the scenarios
1468.56s: if you structure the trade properly,
1470.36s: the short calls will be trading at a loss,
1473.32s: but your long calls will be trading at a profit.
1476.16s: So you're gonna be realizing a net profit overall.
1479.80s: So that is exactly why I like to use the long calls
1483.84s: to cover the cost of the short calls.
1486.60s: Once you do that,
1488.28s: you have to pay attention to your critical strike.
1491.92s: This is a way for us to see
1494.92s: where we can sell short calls without locking in a potential loss.
1500.48s: This is a little more complicated,
1502.64s: so I don't want you to get turned off at the side of this.
1506.80s: There's a formula, it's right over here,
1509.40s: but the punchline is the critical strike lets you know
1513.72s: where you can sell short calls without locking in a loss
1517.52s: because over the lifecycle of the trade,
1519.60s: as you add long calls, get rid of long calls,
1522.60s: add short calls, get rid of short calls,
1524.96s: you are moving money in and out of the account.
1527.36s: You wanna make sure that you're essentially
1529.84s: keeping all short calls sales above your basis,
1534.04s: just like a covered call.
1535.40s: If you're long stock at $100,
1537.64s: and you sell a short call at $99,
1540.72s: you can lose a dollar.
1542.40s: Obviously not accounting for the credit received
1544.28s: from the short call,
1545.12s: but you get the point on the underlying itself.
1547.40s: That's all we're doing here.
1549.32s: So once we calculate that critical strike,
1552.40s: it's just telling us where we can sell short calls
1554.56s: if we want to.
1555.76s: If the long calls are currently trading
1558.52s: more than your adjusted long call basis
1560.80s: as calculated by your critical strike,
1563.08s: you can essentially just trade short calls wherever you want.
1566.96s: Now if the long call is trading below
1570.20s: your adjusted long call basis,
1572.20s: you gotta use your long call basis,
1574.60s: which will be higher
1575.72s: than where the long calls are currently trading
1577.80s: so that you don't get stock.
1579.36s: And again, I have example videos that run through this.
1582.16s: And if you need a refresh on calculating your critical strike,
1588.00s: you could take a look at these two formulas over here.
1590.72s: We're gonna use our adjusted long call basis,
1593.36s: minus wherever the long calls currently are priced
1596.80s: divided by the current long call Delta,
1599.36s: plus the stock price,
1600.96s: that gives you your critical strike.
1603.48s: To figure out your adjusted long call basis,
1606.48s: this is the formula down here.
1608.60s: We're gonna take the long call debit,
1610.60s: plus any short call debits to close,
1613.92s: minus sold to close long call credits divided by
1618.16s: the number of long calls existing times 100.
1620.96s: That probably makes absolutely no sense to you right now,
1623.60s: which is totally fine.
1624.80s: You can replay the video to go through the formulas.
1627.56s: And if you build it out in an Excel sheet,
1630.08s: again, like I have in those other videos,
1632.96s: it starts to make a lot of sense.
1635.16s: So to give you a quick look at what this looks like,
1638.72s: based on the current pricing of the trade as I modeled it,
1641.88s: I could sell up to 4.97 short calls against the long
1647.52s: before I start adding upside risk.
1650.48s: Obviously you can sell 4.97 calls,
1653.08s: so I round this down.
1655.96s: The other thing you'll see over here
1657.60s: is the adjusted leap basis.
1660.68s: So this is the formula as I outlined it over there
1663.20s: to figure out the current basis for the long calls.
1665.84s: I use leaps because a lot of times they are leaps,
1668.56s: but this is just long calls.
1670.80s: And then the critical strike,
1672.20s: this is telling me where I can sell short calls.
1674.68s: So in this example, my short call is 109.
1677.64s: As long as I'm selling short calls at 106.65 and above,
1682.56s: I am not locking in a loss.
1684.80s: So again, you can't sell a short call at 106.65,
1687.72s: so you got around this one up.
1690.00s: And you can build your very own version of this
1692.36s: using the formulas over to the left.
1695.08s: So I know it's a lot,
1697.44s: but this is one of my favorite strategies,
1700.24s: the ratio diagonal.
1702.04s: This is looking at the call side.
1703.92s: You can trade them on the put side as well.
1705.68s: It's a very similar approach.
1707.60s: This video is just about 30 minutes long,
1709.92s: so I'm gonna kill it right here.
