 What's up to all the outliers, Eric here. I got a video for you today on the ratio diagonal option strategy that I run very frequently. You will also hear me refer to it as the call leaps diagonal, because I do trade it to the call side more often than the put side. And leaps are very commonly a part of the equation, but not always. So I have a series that's actually really in depth on this. My goal for this video is to provide a 65 to 70% level of depth overview, however, in one video. So I'm looking to pack a lot of information into this one video. So it's easier for people to find the strategy because it is one of my favorites. So let's do a quick overview of what is a diagonal in general, and then what is the ratio diagonal. So in short, a diagonal is very, very similar to a covered call. And the main difference is instead of using long stock, you use long calls. That's pretty much it. So it's also similar to a calendar in that it's typically across different explorations. However, it's different than a calendar because it's not typically at the same strike for the long call to short call. So quick synopsis, the ratio diagonal has two parts, a long call and a short call. Typically, the long call will be further out in time. The short call will be nearer in time, although it doesn't have to be that way. And then the big difference in the way that I traded as introduced to me by my mentor, the guy that I reference very frequently, I bring it up simply because this trade was not my idea. It's it's his. And I'm not going to take credit for it. I do have my own tweaks to the strategy, but it is not my own. So anyways, with that out of the way, the main reason why trading it, I like to trade it at a ratio is it has a very different and in my opinion, more advantageous risk reward profile. So let's take a look at what a normal diagonal looks like. We're going to be looking at VLO. This is actually what I'm going to run an example back and forth as we go through the content because I actually recently put a trade on in VLO leveraging the strategy. So thought it was a good fit. Okay. So first, let's take a look at the risk profile. This is what a normal or typical diagonal will look like. We have risk to the downside. The max risk to the downside will be the debit you've paid. And then we see this kind of triangle shape where our max profit is. And then if it starts moving up too far, then we actually start to have upside risk. And what's happening here is the long call delta is being overwhelmed by the expanding short call delta. That's all it is. But that's where your upside risk comes from in a typical diagonal. Now this is kind of my take on the diagonal. And you'll see it is a very different risk reward profile. Namely, if we keep going to the right, you'll notice that there's no max upside and there's no upside risk whatsoever. I only have risk to the downside. So similar to the traditional diagonal, my downside risk is going to be capped to the debit I pay to enter the position. Now the reason why I have this upside or this upward sloping angle is I am selling the short calls at a ratio to the long calls. So what you see down here is an actual trade that I had on and I had six long calls, but only three short calls. And we'll get into the different kinds we can structure the ratios in a little bit. But suffice it to say at least for the example that if we have your short calls, then our long calls, we can eliminate upside risk and we can also uncap it so that it's unlimited. Now there's some caveats to that in terms of where we place the short call in relation to the long call and things like that. We'll get into a little bit of that detail in a little bit. But that's the general idea here by trading the short at a ratio to a long, we get rid of this scenario. We appreciate to the upside very similar to a covered call, but it's even like doing a ratio covered call where we have more long stock than the short calls we're selling against it. So this is the breakdown. Now let's get over here and start getting into detail. Now it's going to look a little wordy on the screen. I have a lot of talking notes, but don't worry. I will be flipping back and directing your attention where it should be. So let's get right to it. So as for any strategy, I like to have a couple buckets that I outline. This is again my preferred approach for outlining strategies called a strategy outline. They're kind of individual sections that fit into my broader trading plan. So these are excerpts from my strategy outline for you all. And I'm always going to start with the executive summary, get into the setup, how we're actually going to set this trade up, the management of the trade, and then I'm also going to run you through some tips and tricks throughout the video. Okay, so let's talk about the setup. We already talked about the executive summary of what the strategy is. So for the setup, essentially, we're going to be applying whatever long stock analysis criteria, you typically apply to your long stock positions. Now the criteria and the analysis is going to differ by timeframe because for the long call side of the trade, which is kind of like the base of the trade, I go anywhere from 90 days to expiration out to the max allowable. In the case with VLO, you'll notice that I was out to 20 Jan 23. So if we pull up the option chain, you can see that that was 257 days out. There's a couple ways you can think about the days to expiration. The longer days you give the trade, the lower your theta decay is going to be regardless of the delta, but the delta will amplify how much we can reduce the theta decay. So that's the first thing. The second thing is you give the trade more time to work instead of having to be right in 90 days, we can be right in 200 plus days. Now the downside, it's more expensive. So again, using this example, when I entered the trade, it was trading around $31 or something like that. If I look at it now, let's just use the current price. So it's easier right now, the 80 in the 80 call that's deep in the money right now, it's at 87 delta again. Well, don't worry too much about those details yet. We'll get to it. Just want to talk about the price. Right now it's trading for call at 51 30. If I look at something that's expiring 131 days out, again, let's look at that same 87 delta, which would be the 95 call in this case, that's trading for 30, you know, $6. So you get the point. It's much more expensive the further out in time you go, especially because I like to trade these deep in the money, which is really the next point here. There's a few reasons why I like to trade them deep in the money, meaning an 80 delta plus. I'm going to lower the theta decay as I mentioned, because as you all should know, theta decay is the highest for at the money options. And it obviously accelerates as we get closer to expiration. So we're doing two things to decrease the theta decay. We're going far out in time. And then we are also going deep in the money. And if we take a look at the theta decay, it's less than a penny a day, essentially, it's so far in the money what happens is thinkorswomen actually has an issue calculating it. So as you can see out here, it's two cents a day, two cents a day, one cent a day. This isn't two cents a day. This will be under under a penny or a penny and change. So there's two things we're doing to really limit the theta decay. We also experience lower Vega, which is also important because depending on how we structure the strategy, although change in volatility might be helpful to us, we don't want it hurting us. So it assists with that as well. And then the last thing is by going with the higher delta, we enjoy more of a move of the underlying because again, if we're buying an 80 delta call for every $1 option, for every $1 move in the underlying, those options are going to move by 80 cents, all things being equal. So that's super important for this strategy to make money for us. If you go really far out of the money, you might be able to again, appreciate more compounding of your debit pay to entry, but you're not going to make the same gross number of dollars. So that's why I like to go with a higher delta. It's going to lower our theta lower Vega and then we're going to enjoy more of a move in the underlying. Okay, so let's move on to just some of the background of the trade. Max profit technically should be undefined. There are instances where if we sell at a 1 to 1 ratio, we might have a defined upside trade. So for example, if I start adding more short calls in this hypothetical scenario and I go six to six. So this means one to one. I have six long six shorts. Notice how we still have that kind of peak that you saw in the other more traditional diagonal, but there's still no upside risk. It's just capped now, meaning we can't make more in more money essentially anything above 148 on. So that is a scenario where we could have capped upside risk, which would be somewhere around the short call. But in general, it should be undefined if we're structuring it. First loss is going to be your debit paid and that's going to be at expiration. There's two things that we're looking for. This is the primary thing. We want the stock to go up in price. We're trading this just like a covered call. Ideal scenario is the underlying blows through our short calls and we're seeing a loss on those short calls. That's perfect scenario. A lot of people get really confused about that with covered calls thinking, oh, I wanted to be below my short strike or before below the short call. And it's a misconception. It's just a mental block because they don't want to have a trade that's technically a part of the trade that's technically losing. But Max Profit rest assured is the higher it goes. And then the other scenario that does help the strategy is if implied volatility expands. Now again, we're going to be we're going to experience less in sensitivity to it because of the way we structure the trade to reduce Vega. But nonetheless, if we go from IV percentile that's 10 and it goes to 60, your leaps will appreciate somewhat in value. So that is the other scenario. So one of the first hurdles I'm going to be looking for when I'm looking for this trade is I want to see something that I'm bullish in. And if you need some ideas on how I like to apply fundamental technical analysis, I have a whole playlist on it. So feel free to go check that out because I'm not going to go super far in a detail in the interest of your time. But anyways, that's from a technical standpoint. But I'm also going to look for implied volatility ideally to be a little bit lower so that I have the exposure to enjoy if implied volatility actually expands that helps the position. Okay. So let's talk through really the four main steps to entering this trade. And then I'm going to give you some detail on all of these. In the meantime, I am going to throw out some of these tips and tricks so that we can kind of talk about it as we go. Now one of the things that I do want to talk about upfront is this right here, the ratio trade off. So when we're structuring this trade, there's a couple ways to look at it. If I buy sex and sell three, I'm going to make a certain amount of money. If I sell six against my long six, the amount of money I'm going to make upfront increases because instead of getting three credits for whatever the premium is of the option, I'm going to get six of them. So it's super important to think about the trade off here. If you sell more short calls against the longs, you're going to collect more money up front and you're going to give away upside potential. And then the inverse is true. If you sell fewer short calls, you're going to collect less money upfront and give up less upside potential. So you can apply that thought process throughout the life cycle of the trade. If you want to wait collecting more money upfront, then sell more or sell more aggressively closer to the money or your basis. If that's not the case, then consider selling less so that you can enjoy more of the upside. Totally up to you. So it's important to think about the trade off early. Another super important part of the setup is liquidity. It is so important to check the liquidity, especially on the long calls or puts the further out in time you go. So one of my favorite ways to do that is to check out the bit ask spread as well as the open interest. So if you'll notice here, the open interest, there's 1800 contracts, which is pretty deep. And for something that's 250, 7 days out, there's a 60 cent wide bit ask spread that is very liquid, especially for something that's $130. This is so important to check because if you find something, let's say if it was the same trade, VLO, same everything, but this was $10 wide, big problem. Same thing if we look at some of the shallow open interest strikes, right? So if I look at this 35 call, there's eight of them. And if I look at the 30 call, there's four of them. And then if we look at the 25, there's zero. So liquidity can absolutely become an issue. Trading liquid underlines is super important for the strategy because otherwise you might be able to worm your way into the strategy, but you can get stuck pretty bad. If you can't exit the trade for a profit, even if it's showing a good profit, you might not be able to get out. So liquidity is so important here. The other thing is the products that you're trading. Again, I'm not going to go super far in a product selection, but in general, I'm going to be looking at index ETFs, sector ETFs, S&P 500 stocks, things like that. I absolutely will trade this in more speculative products as well. It's not limited to those. But the reason why I bring that up is especially for applying the leaps side of things, meaning we're going really far out in time. I want it to be something I'm comfortable holding for a long period of time. All right. With all of that, let's talk about the actual steps to setting this trade up. First off, portfolio review and allocate. This is what I do for every single trade. I'm going to look at the portfolio, see what I need, see what gaps I have, and then also to gain some information in terms of where I can add risk, where I can't, things like that. Then I'm going to allocate what this means is I am going to set aside a certain amount of money for my portfolio that I'm going to apply to this trade. So for this specific trade in VLO, I'll even show you the little Excel sheet that I have here. I was setting aside $25,000 for that trade. I do that up front to avoid any conflict of emotional interest over the life cycle of the trade. I like to do it before the trade is on when my mind is very clear. That I have found to be a great practice. And then the outlay. So this is what I'm going to initially offer the trade. That's my initial outlay. So again, using the current example in VLO, I allocated $25,000. The initial outlay was $19,020. So I used 76% of my allocation for the trade. And what I allow for that varies over time. But again, for the sake of this conversation, it's just super important to differentiate between what you're offering to the trade, what the outlay is. The reason why I like to break it up that way is because it allows me to scale into the trade over the life cycle of the trade. Meaning if it goes in my favor or against me, I will evaluate the product and look at committing more capital. If it's moving against me and I add a little bit more risk, it's a good way to manage my basis. Same thing to the upside. If I'm getting a move in my favor and I add a little bit of risk that can actually help me a lot by keeping my overall basis a little bit lower while I gain more exposure. So what I typically use for that is around a 5% move. I'm going to take a look at it and then decide do I want to scale in more or not? Simple as that. So now that we have the allocation set aside for the trade, we're going to figure out we might have already had the trade identified what product we wanted to enter. But then we're going to apply our screens to it. So again, checking things like that liquidity. I'm also going to apply my typical technical analysis, fundamental analysis for a bullish trade. So I'm going to look at moving averages across different time frames. The time frames should correspond to what I'm looking at. So for example, in this VLO trade since I was 257 days out, I started pretty far out and I zoomed in. So I actually started with the two year daily to get a broader sense of it, zoomed in to a one year to again, make sure that I'm still in an upward sloping linear regression channels. The moving averages were aligned as I wanted them earnings was looking good quarter over quarter, all of those sorts of things. So when all that's done, you decide that this is a good product for you. You like it. Then we got a structure of the trade. So we're going to look at the long side first and then the short side for the long side, you got to pick what days to expiration you want to run, what delta you're going to use, which is typically easy, zero point a zero or higher. And then what size? And again, even this is pretty easy based on your allocation and then how you want to consider your initial outlay. I typically don't like using more than 80% of the allocation on the initial outlay. A lot more times is closer to 50%, but it depends on what I'm trading and what I'm thinking. That's just to give you some ideas. And then for the short, I do like to keep that shorter, days to expiration than the long. So my long, typically in the shortest scenario would be 90 days out. And that's rare. Normally it's six months at least. That's a common time for him. Six months to a year and change. The short will be 20 to 40 days to expiration. This is so that I can kind of turn them out and do my best to stay sensitive to theta decay because shorter days to expiration, the theta decay curve accelerates. And another important note is that on the first entry sale of those short calls when you first get into the trade, that's when you're going to make your most money on the short calls because typically the market's going to start moving and then you don't have as much fidelity. So I typically like that 20 to 40 days. It's a sweet spot. And then the other thing to keep in mind, we talked about this ratio before what I like to do is maintain a specific delta ratio. So the delta ratio is a way for me to make sure that I'm not experiencing upside risk and uncapping my upside. So to figure out your delta ratio, you just take the number of long calls that you have, multiplied by your delta, divide that by 2.1 times your short call delta. So this is just making sure that you have enough long delta to overwhelm the short call delta. So again, in this example, if we go to the risk profile, you'll see that I have a maximum of long 600 delta. I have a maximum of short 300 delta. I have 300 excess delta. That's how I know I have no upside risk and I have no kept upside. This is just a simple way to keep that kind of top of mind easy to think about. And I use a calculator for it. So that's exactly how I figure this figure out right here is by using that delta ratio. So let's talk about the final details here. Building a sheet entering the trade. Again, I showed you my Excel sheet, the other more in depth video I have on this will go into detail on the Excel sheet. So I'm not going to spend a ton of time on it. But then let's talk about managing this trade. So there's a couple of scenarios that happen in the lifecycle of the trade. We can have the stock trends sideways. So one scenario. We can have a scenario where our short call falls in the money and we can have a scenario where the stock drops. So that's how we're going to be able to make sure that our short call would be out of the money and potentially even even our long call in a worst case scenario. So let's start with the first. This is easy. The stock goes sideways depending on where your short call is. You're just going to harvest it. You're going to wait until it's about 70% max profit. That's what I like to take out of it. And take the trade off. If the short call falls in the money, there's two things you can do. What a profit. It's actually what I did in VLO. I had a pretty big rally in the underlying short calls were in the money. I just took the whole thing off. Now really important note, when you do choose to take the whole trade off, I typically like to kind of volley back and forth. What I mean by that is I will sell one of the long dated options. I'm gauging market liquidity without offering myself upside risk because what you don't want to do is enter or I'm sorry, exit all of your long calls. Then you have naked short calls. That's a market risk. If for whatever reason at that exact moment or right around that time, the underlying just runs away. This is stupid risk to take. So I like to exit with one of the long dated calls. Find the market. Make sure I'm okay exiting at that price. Then I will exit all of the short calls at once. Then I will go back to the long calls and exit the rest of those, accepting the fact that there might be a little slippage in the time it takes me to do that. But I find that that to be a really efficient way to get out of the trade with really no risk because that scenario outlined, although not likely, it could happen and how angry would you be. If you entered all of your longs, you get this big rally all of a sudden and now you have a huge loss that was completely avoidable. I don't want to go through that flow, so I don't do it. Now, slightly more complicated scenario is if you choose to sell, close your short calls at a debit, then what I like to use is the long calls to cover the cost. So what I mean by that is if I have short calls that are in the money, I'm going to figure out the debit to close those short calls. Then I'm going to look at and see how many long calls I need to sell in order to cover the cost for those short calls. Because what's going to be happening in the scenarios, if you structure the trade properly, the short calls will be trading at a loss, but your long calls will be trading at a profit. So you're going to be realizing a net profit overall. So that is exactly why I like to use the long calls to cover the cost of the short calls. Once you do that, you have to pay attention to your critical strike. This is a way for us to see where we can sell short calls without locking in a potential loss. This is a little more complicated, so I don't want you to get turned off at the site of this. There's a formula. It's right over here, but the punch line is the critical strike lets you know where you can sell short calls without locking in a loss. Because over the lifecycle of the trade, as you add long calls, get rid of long calls, add short calls, get rid of short calls, you are moving money in and out of the account. You want to make sure that you're essentially keeping all short calls sales above your basis, like a covered call. If you're long stock at $100 and you sell a short call at $99, you can lose a dollar. Obviously not accounting for the credit received from the short call, but you get the point on the underlying itself. That's all we're doing here. So once we calculate that critical strike, it's just telling us where we can sell short calls if we want to. If the long calls are currently trading more than your adjusted long call basis as calculated by your critical strike, you can essentially just trade short calls wherever you want. Now if the long call is trading below your adjusted long call basis, you got to use your long call basis, which will be higher than where the long calls are currently trading, so that you don't get stock. And again, I have example videos that run through this. And if you need a refresh on calculating your critical strike, you could take a look at these two formulas over here. You're going to use our adjusted long call basis minus wherever the long calls currently are priced divided by the current long call delta plus the stock price. That gives you your critical strike to figure out your adjusted long call basis. This is the formula down here. We're going to take the long call debit plus any short call debits to close minus sold to close long call credits divided by the number of long calls existing times 100. That probably makes absolutely no sense to you right now, which is totally fine. You can replay the video to go through the formulas. And if you build it out in an Excel sheet, again, like I have in those other videos, it starts to make a lot of sense. So to give you a quick look at what this looks like, based on the current pricing of the trade as I modeled it, I could sell up to 4.97 short calls against the long before I start adding upside risk. Obviously, you can sell 4.97 calls. So I round this down. The other thing you'll see over here is the adjusted leap basis. So this is the formula as I outlined it over there to figure out the current basis for the long calls. I use leaps because a lot of times they are leaps, but this is just long calls. And then the critical strike, this is telling me where I can sell short calls. So in this example, my short call is 109 as long as I'm selling short calls at 10665 and above, I am not locking in a loss. So again, you can't sell a short call at 10665. So you got around this one up and you can build your very own version of this using the formulas over to the left. So I know it's a lot, but this is one of my favorite strategies, the ratio diagonal. This is looking at the call side. You can trade them on the put side as well. It's a very similar approach. This video is just about 30 minutes long. So I'm going to kill it right here.
