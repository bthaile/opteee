570.00s:  Let's see, he did.
572.84s:  Would we get interesting?
577.00s:  Let's see what the cat says.
585.24s:  Cat's waiting outside or cat.
586.96s:  The dog's waiting outside.
588.36s:  It was 2 Jan 2020.
591.44s:  Still waiting.
592.96s:  I'm assuming this is like waiting for the squeeze.
596.20s:  That's my best guess.
597.72s:  But no understanding yet.
609.72s:  It's like opera music of some sort.
618.16s:  Getting down the tree, dogs getting old.
633.52s:  The sleepy dog.
635.52s:  They got tired.
636.92s:  Dog went away.
640.64s:  Tired dog.
641.64s:  Okay.
642.64s:  Weird.
643.64s:  We'll have to spend a little time figuring out what this is.
648.44s:  We'll help get the word out for whatever that is.
653.76s:  Now back to the agenda for today.
659.36s:  We will talk about this money mindset idea because it's a feeder
663.64s:  and to everything else that we do.
665.56s:  And before we get into the broad market,
668.84s:  one other announcement, our leader board so far for the month.
672.60s:  For those that don't know, we have the discord.
675.40s:  It's completely free to join.
676.88s:  But the discord, the lifeblood is participation.
679.72s:  It's people sharing information, helping one another and stuff like that.
682.60s:  So we want to reward those that are actively helping other people
687.44s:  and actively participating.
688.76s:  So what I'm doing is at the end of each month, the top 10,
693.12s:  obviously I will not be a part of it.
695.88s:  But the top 10 will be entered into random drawing.
700.12s:  And then you'll either get like an Amazon gift card
703.16s:  or you'll have a chance to hop on like a 20 minute one-on-one call with me.
706.64s:  Your choice.
707.68s:  So you want to grab something?
709.80s:  Sweet, I don't remember exactly what we picked.
711.96s:  I think it was like 15, 25 bucks or something like that.
714.00s:  The idea was to grab yourself a coffee.
715.64s:  It's not like to just give money just for the sake of give.
718.48s:  I always feel like that's kind of lame.
720.40s:  It should be tied to something.
722.20s:  So the idea was to help somebody go grab a coffee.
724.80s:  But then I realized not everybody has a Starbucks around.
728.20s:  So this is who we have in front so far.
733.20s:  We have Erzule, Urzule, Urzule.
736.20s:  We got Joe, Callahan, Ric Sky, Dad, BOD, better grab chalk.
741.68s:  That's a fun named Dornob in Studios Old Man.
744.36s:  These are always hilarious, all of the different handles.
746.68s:  So that's who's up front.
752.68s:  Time for markets.
754.60s:  So where are we at?
755.40s:  We're at 12.30.
756.76s:  Let's update our thing, market overview.
762.68s:  Let's see what the deal is.
765.00s:  The relief rally in my opinion is now pretty confirmed.
770.52s:  We have a very firm gap up and close above this,
775.52s:  probably like six and a one, six or one and a half handle.
780.16s:  And the market was pretty decisive on closing up here.
784.52s:  So inside day once again up here, but that's a pretty decent gap up.
788.28s:  So this downward trend is now invalid.
791.44s:  This downward trend is broken.
793.84s:  And we now have a new local high.
798.80s:  This is the local high that I told you was really, really important
802.24s:  because it needed to exceed this local high
805.84s:  to actually signal a change in trend.
809.84s:  So we had this close above that local high.
813.40s:  And then we had a confirmation close above that local high today.
816.40s:  Now, couple notes just because this happened doesn't mean
820.40s:  it can't crash tomorrow.
821.92s:  One of the problems people have when they apply this kind of methodology
825.28s:  of analyzing and trying to come up with conclusions like this
828.36s:  is we start to believe too much of our own cool aid,
832.72s:  which means we can see things, we can identify trends,
835.28s:  we can come up with ideas, but they're not prescriptive.
837.44s:  The market will always do whatever the market's going to do.
842.44s:  So what that tells me is right now, though,
845.24s:  based on what exists today, this looks like an assumption of a new trend.
851.68s:  That's been confirmed.
852.88s:  So that leads to a slightly more risk on portfolio.
859.28s:  Now, on Thursday, my game plan is Tuesdays.
864.00s:  When I drop the video, that will be GameStop specific
866.92s:  because I want to focus on that a little bit more.
869.52s:  And especially now with the cat coming out,
871.68s:  I want to get back on a like,
873.00s:  in actual regimented cadence of looking at it
875.64s:  and reporting out to you guys.
877.60s:  And then Thursday is going to be looking
879.84s:  in reporting out the coverage strangle holdings.
882.52s:  So the specific model coverage strangle portfolio
885.52s:  is that we've been talking about in TQ's Upro, Ibit,
888.76s:  and then GameStop if anything happens in there.
890.96s:  So we'll spend a little more time talking
893.16s:  about those specific positions tomorrow on that video.
896.56s:  But right now, I actually have a couple of short calls
900.72s:  that have phoned in the money that require management.
903.28s:  I did some small stuff a little earlier today,
906.08s:  but just in terms of the coverage strangle themselves.
908.76s:  Now, from a broad market perspective,
910.64s:  there are a couple really key themes
913.12s:  that I think are worth your attention.
915.28s:  The first one is bonds are just about stabilizing.
920.92s:  They had their gap up yesterday
922.60s:  and then they had a pretty big down red day today.
925.24s:  This is a decoupling from its correlation with equities.
931.04s:  So yesterday, market was up, bonds were up,
933.84s:  direct correlation on the day.
936.00s:  Today, market was up again a little bit more
938.96s:  and bonds are down today.
940.68s:  So the correlation between equities and bonds
944.16s:  is still a little bit all over the place.
947.28s:  This is important from a portfolio structure standpoint.
950.40s:  If you're using bonds as like your risk off asset,
955.40s:  it's difficult to see how risk off they actually are
958.64s:  at this point.
959.56s:  So you should at least be aware of that.
962.60s:  When we look at small caps, small caps are lagging.
967.44s:  Small caps still are nowhere near this local high,
971.20s:  whereas S&P is closing in on the local high
974.76s:  and Q's is not that far off, 531 versus 539.
978.88s:  So Q's is within striking distance
981.60s:  and small caps still a ways off.
985.08s:  So this tells us that the market is still really
989.32s:  expensive about rates, about inflation,
991.84s:  and about the impact that this is going to have
995.12s:  for smaller companies.
996.80s:  Otherwise, we would see this same movement in small caps
1001.44s:  at this point, because all of this other news
1004.12s:  is already priced in.
1004.92s:  The probability of the rate cuts has been priced in.
1007.16s:  All of this stuff is been priced in.
1009.68s:  And there's been no real new news
1012.68s:  that leads us to believe inflation is starting to pop back up
1017.72s:  or anything like that based on the breadth of what we see.
1020.12s:  But if we take a look at the Fed watch tool
1022.44s:  and let's take a look at the historical run rate here,
1026.04s:  you can see that there's still essentially 97%
1031.24s:  plus percent chance.
1032.20s:  And this is for the last week, almost,
1035.04s:  of 425 to 450 target rate for the 29 Jan meeting.
1041.60s:  So we're looking at no change.
1043.88s:  That's the overwhelming probability.
1045.48s:  That's what it continues to be.
1047.32s:  Let's take a look at compare.
1049.16s:  You can see it's not even changing much.
1051.08s:  So very, very little, very, very little change going on here.
1055.16s:  Now, I was watching, I've been watching a bunch
1058.60s:  of Trump's recent speeches to understand,
1063.16s:  you know, what his position is on stuff
1065.64s:  and what we can expect.
1067.72s:  So I posted this and I'll reiterate it.
1070.16s:  I posted this in the discord that Trump
1072.96s:  was vocalizing the potential of a 25% tariff
1077.48s:  on both Canada and Mexico.
1081.68s:  He was talking about potentially another 10% tariff on China.
1085.28s:  All of this is early as the first of February.
1088.12s:  That's an important note because again,
1090.44s:  depending on how that progresses,
1092.28s:  what direction that goes, that will be a big deal
1096.44s:  if it actually comes to fruition in that way.
1100.12s:  Specifically, the impact to Mexico and Canada.
1104.72s:  Those are ones I'm very, very, very interested
1107.00s:  in seeing how they unfold.
1108.28s:  So when I say interested in seeing how they unfold,
1111.24s:  this means that I'm watching all of the news
1114.16s:  that comes out in support of the broader topic.
1120.84s:  So that means any piece of news article,
1124.32s:  I have a specific GPT that helps me comb
1127.16s:  for any key terms related to this stuff.
1130.24s:  And it's because the market is gonna price on that.
1133.24s:  So if it looks like it's starting to become more
1135.44s:  and more realistic, I think that you'll see
1137.72s:  the market begin pricing that kind of thing in
1139.64s:  because the short-term impact will be not end of days
1144.64s:  but definitely impactful.
1146.64s:  So we have to keep an eye on it.
1148.64s:  So the next thing Trump's from Tommy Trump,
1153.64s:  I hope Stargate opens a portal to another universe.
1156.52s:  That would be super cool.
1158.52s:  Let's take a look at the Stargate.
1159.72s:  I know that there's been a lot of news about that today.
1165.40s:  Here.
1168.72s:  So let's take a look at open AIs
1174.68s:  and then let's take a look at this and this.
1182.84s:  This is funny.
1184.00s:  So one of the things that we have to pay attention to
1188.44s:  is that the news as far as I can tell so far
1194.16s:  is doing everything they can to make this relationship damaging.
1200.24s:  I just noticed this over and over and over again.
1203.00s:  I see news articles saying like, oh, is Musk the new president?
1207.52s:  And obviously that's a play on Trump.
1209.88s:  You know, challenging his authority,
1211.36s:  making it seem like Musk is the one actually calling
1214.24s:  the shots versus Trump.
1215.32s:  And they're, I could just tell by the phrasing of these
1217.76s:  that we're trying to pit the two against one another.
1220.64s:  Now I don't know the actual relationship.
1222.40s:  I don't know either of them in person.
1223.64s:  I have no idea,
1224.48s:  but I can tell you by the framing of the articles
1227.36s:  that is part of what I can pick up from here.
1230.48s:  So let's take a look from open AI
1234.96s:  and see what open AI says.
1236.40s:  It says Stargate Project is a new company
1238.28s:  which intends to invest $500 billion over the next four years
1241.20s:  building new AI infrastructure for open AI in the US.
1246.16s:  We will begin deploying 100 billion immediately.
1248.80s:  The infrastructure will secure American leadership in AI,
1251.28s:  hundreds of thousands of American jobs,
1252.88s:  generate massive economic benefits for the world.
1258.40s:  The original or I'm sorry,
1260.56s:  the initial equity funders in Stargator,
1263.28s:  Softbank, OpenAI, Oracle, MGX, Softbank,
1265.76s:  and OpenAI are lead partners for Stargate with Softbank
1268.64s:  having financial responsibilities, OpenAI,
1270.72s:  having operational responsibility.
1273.04s:  So let's take a look at this Tesla and SpaceX CEO,
1279.92s:  Elon Musk said OpenAI, Oracle and Softbank don't actually have the money
1283.20s:  to back up their pledge to invest $500 billion in AI infrastructure.
1288.40s:  Trump touted the joint venture,
1290.16s:  dubbed the Stargate Project on the first full day of a second term.
1293.68s:  Softbank has well under $10 billion secured.
1296.56s:  I have that ungood authority.
1298.40s:  Musk wrote overnight on his platform, X.
1304.40s:  They don't actually have the money.
1311.12s:  I generally respect your accomplishments and think you are the most
1313.84s:  inspiring entrepreneur of our time.
1315.36s:  Altman wrote on X.
1318.88s:  Yet Musk claimed about Softbank liquidity was wrong as you surely know.
1322.96s:  I realized what is great for the country isn't always what's optimal for your companies,
1326.48s:  but in your new role, I hope you'll mostly put America first.
1332.72s:  So a little bit of back and forth here.
1335.84s:  Now for those that don't know, there is a little bit of tension between OpenAI and Musk.
1341.76s:  Musk has a history with the company, but then he also has a lot of very different
1347.68s:  personal opinions than Altman.
1351.28s:  And the reason why I highlight that is because as you see this going back and forth,
1355.92s:  just having that context behind the relationships I think is useful because it helps us process
1361.04s:  some of the information that we're seeing.
1363.12s:  So yeah, it's kind of like whatever.
1367.92s:  The interesting component of for all of this though is there's obviously huge focus on AI.
1377.84s:  That's the top line takeaway from a trader's perspective.
1381.76s:  What matters to us? What can we actually make money off of?
1385.52s:  What can we make trade decisions on?
1387.92s:  Is funds of interest in AI?
1391.68s:  And we know this already, but seeing more and more focus and money being talked about in that space
1397.76s:  will continue to drive some of the key AI stocks that exist.
1402.64s:  N54 says quantum computing.
1404.24s:  Quantum computing I think by all accounts is a pretty long ways off.
1410.08s:  So I think quantum computing is still a thing.
1413.04s:  I think people are interested in quantum computing.
1415.44s:  However, I do not think that quantum computing is going to be a massive focus in the near term here.
1422.48s:  And a lot of that is because it still weighs away from mainstream adoption in ways that can like
1431.84s:  really amplify productivity and drive revenues of some sort.
1437.20s:  So first question for Chattachy PT is create a list of the top 20 AI involved companies
1448.24s:  sorted by market cap.
1453.36s:  And let's see what that comes up.
1454.56s:  So I think we can clear out of this.
1456.56s:  And while Chattachy PT is hooking us up with that,
1459.60s:  let's take a look through the broad market really quick,
1463.04s:  just to understand what breadth looked like today.
1466.64s:  Let's get into overall momentum, a lot of the climbers.
1470.16s:  So a lot of what the fuck?
1476.64s:  I'm looking at the output and there's a coupling here that really confused me.
1480.56s:  So I think I need to refine that.
1483.52s:  Refine this not to be companies that integrated AI but companies that enable.
1497.12s:  Yeah.
1500.16s:  So both 59% decline there, 70% decline there.
1504.88s:  So both are in bulk of decline on the day.
1507.76s:  Interesting subtext that you can pick up from that where that's a lot of things being sold off.
1514.64s:  I think there's been a lot of really, really significant focus on the relief rally and how strong it is.
1525.12s:  And again, based on what I see today, it looks like the relief rally looks pretty strong.
1530.08s:  It doesn't mean that it's impervious or that it's not going to weigh in at some point.
1533.76s:  But the fact that there was a subsequent gap up today is pretty telling, but it's also it is
1540.16s:  a little bit interesting because I don't think we want too much upfront pricing and
1550.16s:  gapping up like this before we have some clarity.
1553.92s:  For example, the tariffs and whatnot because if the market starts getting too far ahead of
1558.08s:  itself as we've seen it do multiple times, especially with the rate cut environment, then when we get
1564.24s:  potential pullback based on new news, it tends to be way more aggressive than what we would want to see.
1569.52s:  So the reason why I mentioned that again taking it back to a trading lens or trading perspective
1574.40s:  is if we start to think that the market is starting to get ahead of itself, it's rallying too hard
1578.96s:  too fast. That starts to set us up for a bigger fall. That changes the way that we might use our
1584.56s:  portfolio and what it might go into. For me personally, that means that the way that the
1588.56s:  covered strangle overall allocation, not just the sample allocation that I show you guys,
1593.20s:  but like the total allocation, which is still the bulk of the portfolio will be managed because
1598.32s:  I don't want to get caught too heavily to the downside on a potential fall like that.
1602.72s:  If there is new news, that sends the market in the opposite direction.
1606.88s:  So that's that. Let's think peak at sectors.
1612.16s:  Energy dying. We talked about this literally yesterday. We talked about the key breakdown
1618.16s:  between these two averages, the 20 day and the 5 day. When you see this big of a break between the
1624.40s:  20 day and the 5 day, this is really, really dangerous. And it means that there's been a bit of wind
1631.92s:  at the back, but it's starting to wane. We actually spent a decent amount of time on the stream
1636.96s:  yesterday digging into the internals of energy, figuring out what companies are actually leading to
1642.40s:  decline. What companies are still showing resiliency because there are some of them. So if somebody
1647.60s:  wants an energy play, they're there. There's stuff there that is available still. It's just not
1653.20s:  the sector itself is starting to show some weakness. That weakness seems to come from a couple
1658.00s:  different things, but a lot of it looks like profit taking. There are not insignificant volume
1663.36s:  nodes that we can see in energy that are now just getting to the point where they're showing a
1668.48s:  little bit of a profit. And a lot of people try to take the exit there when they can. Conversely,
1674.40s:  we see communication services showing a massive deviation in the other direction, meaning strength
1680.64s:  on a comparative basis. The same methodology we can apply to take a look at materials going from
1687.36s:  93% above a five day MA to 64. And we can track the change in the five day, right? So one of the
1694.96s:  things I will look for, I think it's, where is it? Hold on, I think there's another.
1704.96s:  Maybe it's down here. No, give me one sec.
1709.84s:  This. So this we can track the day over day change for the five day. This is looking at highs and lows
1721.28s:  for a specific sector, but we can look at this on a larger basis. And we can track how the sectors
1731.60s:  are moving on a day by day basis relative. So yeah, it looks mostly tech dominated,
1740.40s:  which makes sense. Tech has been slowing down for a while. And that didn't really feel right.
1748.32s:  So this looks closer to what I would expect to see here.
1753.20s:  Let's take a look at.
1763.92s:  Yes, and P500. Yeah. No big shock.
1773.52s:  And financials are rolling over a little bit. That's kind of interesting.
1776.96s:  Now we also have earnings. So let's take a quick peek at earnings that have come out so far.
1786.88s:  So we had a key bank, triple M, Schwab, UAL, Netflix, capital one finance, STX. And let's take a
1796.40s:  quick poke through all of these. And we just want to see how the names are behaving. We want to
1804.88s:  get a sense of how earnings is going in general. So I'm going to dump them over here in this little
1810.32s:  chart above my head. You can still see it. It's just a little smaller, but that's okay.
1819.04s:  So key. Funny enough had like a bigger gap pre-earnings. That's funny.
1826.56s:  Let's take a look at MMM. Yeah, MMM had a great earnings.
1837.12s:  So what did this come in at 168 compared to 166? So a slight beat really, really good
1843.20s:  as really good forecast I would surmise. But this also would be something to watch for post earnings
1849.92s:  announcement drift. These kinds of things tend to look really good.
1855.92s:  Sanjay says, GME is pumping now any news. The news is the cat posted on X, which crazy, but that's
1863.12s:  the news, but that is the news. The cat did post. And as you all know, when he posts, GameStop will move.
1874.40s:  We have learned that for sure. All right, let's get back and see what else. So
1881.28s:  Triple N looks good. That might be viable for a continuation move. Same thing for Schwab.
1888.32s:  That looks good. UAL.
1893.52s:  Inside move. How did they do? How did they beat? They came in at 326 versus 3 in a penny.
1902.08s:  So they looked okay and how did Netflix do?
1909.60s:  Beat to the upside.
1912.40s:  Buy about a dime.
1916.08s:  Big gap up. Big gap up into a fade down. That's interesting. That's a lot of profit taking.
1922.48s:  COF.
1923.60s:  Beat upside. So one of the themes that I hope you can identify as we're doing this and we're
1934.32s:  looking at a lot of these is there's a lot of beats.
1938.72s:  203 first dollar 67 and these are across different industries. The reason why that matters
1944.32s:  is because it gives you a general sense of where the broader market sits. Day.
1951.36s:  So let's take a look at some of them from today. My earnings play so far have been pretty good.
1955.92s:  We're not seeing like crazy moves. Johnson and Johnson. How did Johnson and Johnson do?
1962.48s:  Eaked out of profit.
1965.04s:  Who's expected at $2 and $3 and 10. They came in at 2 and 4 pennies.
1973.68s:  CMA.
1974.40s:  CMA.
1978.40s:  Don't know how that is on a relative basis.
1982.96s:  And then Haliburton rolling over.
1989.04s:  Still beat by a penny but rolling over.
1991.76s:  EBT.
1998.72s:  Very, very slight beat.
2001.84s:  EG.
2005.60s:  That also gap up on a beat.
2009.44s:  Dollar 88 slight beat and then last one ally.
2012.96s:  That would be 78 cents versus 60. Pretty big beat on that.
2020.80s:  So now let's take a look at the rest of the week really fast.
2024.48s:  What time we got? We're about 530. That's okay.
2028.16s:  And this is not what I meant to clear.
2032.32s:  That was funny. I accidentally just clicked my Reddit browser or like my Reddit tab versus
2038.80s:  O rats because they're both just orange. So my brain literally was just like, yeah, orange.
2043.36s:  Click that on.
2046.64s:  And let's sign in. We want to take a look at the remaining for this week and maybe plot out
2053.92s:  a couple trades super fast. Just to see if stuff looks good. So I'm actually going to grab my
2058.88s:  watch list for my actual like portfolio and stuff here for a second and then we'll take a look at
2064.64s:  these. So we are now looking at a Thursday PM.
2080.56s:  Right at AM.
2087.52s:  Let's see if there's anything else we need to add in. All right, we go.
2090.96s:  So Thursday PM CSX.
2098.08s:  CSX tends to be a decent one. We'll see. We have SMCI, EXN, and then Friday morning, AXP,
2110.40s:  NEE, and BZ.
2121.76s:  So now let's look at the, what the fuck? There's nothing there.
2130.80s:  This thing is fucked up right. Whatever. All right. Let's take a look. So CSX.
2161.76s:  This is fine.
2169.84s:  Yeah, this is okay.
2181.44s:  What else we got? Take a look at SMCI.
2191.20s:  SMCI will be a pass.
2195.76s:  The XN.
2199.52s:  We'll look at the pricing. Yeah, this one looks okay.
2204.00s:  The XP.
2213.12s:  This one I will probably play, but in a slightly more nuanced way than like just a standard earnings.
2220.40s:  Chris premium.
2224.16s:  Any. I think I already have a position on in any.
2230.40s:  For a directional place or nothing in there for me. And then VZ.
2238.08s:  VZ nothing might actually just trade it to the downside. VZ is no good.
2243.44s:  Cool. So there's our quick rundown of upcoming earnings.
2249.92s:  And we can pivot really quick. If there's any specific questions or anything that you guys
2257.20s:  want to take a look at together, now's a good time to do that. And then we will get into the
2261.44s:  skill dev section for what we're looking at. So this will be just kind of general Q&A
2267.52s:  flipping through stuff. Mateo says any e have liquidity yet does.
2278.96s:  Yeah, that's fine. It's what you would expect for a smaller market cap company, but yeah,
2285.04s:  it's got plenty of OI and stuff. There's nothing wrong with it.
2288.08s:  But.
2290.96s:  James says D H I up is housing becoming a thing again. Materials is so materials has been doing pretty
2298.64s:  well. So if we take a look at D H I I mean it's D H I's not really up for.
2307.52s:  I'm really doing shit. What was it expected at?
2311.28s:  I don't know what D H I's expected earnings were, but I mean it's out like a five bucks from
2320.00s:  140 to 145. So still I actually think D H I's an example of dying, but materials as the sector is
2328.64s:  doing. Here. So you'll probably see a little bit of sympathy move there. And then real estate
2337.52s:  started having like a really slight relief rally, but this was also really, really soft,
2344.56s:  like really, really soft.
2347.92s:  James says second biggest gainer and S and P today. That's it doesn't really mean anything,
2353.60s:  right? Like when we say second biggest gainer, but it's something that's up 2.2%.
2359.84s:  Who gives a shit? Doesn't really, doesn't really move the needle much at all. And it's still
2366.64s:  down lower than where it was here. It's still like in an overall downtrend. You can't really take
2374.00s:  a single day like that and you know apply it into anything super meaningful, but it's still
2383.04s:  just super weak. It did start consolidating here for a while, but yeah, it's still just super,
2389.84s:  super weak. Now it did pop on the 14th. That's a little interesting. I don't know what happened then.
2396.64s:  What happened on the 14th? Goldman Sachs adjusted price target to what?
2405.12s:  Wait, did that say from 171 to 200 or the other way? Does that confuse me? Hold on.
2413.28s:  Yeah, it adjusts the price target from 200 to 171. And somehow it rallied on that.
2421.84s:  I am confused. I don't get that. I don't get that at all. That doesn't seem to make sense.
2435.68s:  Does it? What else? Maintains a buy? Maybe that's why? Oh, maybe this is it. So on the 13th,
2447.44s:  what time was this on the 13th?
2453.60s:  1317. So this would make sense after the market closed. The HI announces restructuring of
2458.64s:  its operations to separate the dice in clearance jobs business, 8% workforce reduction.
2466.80s:  And it sees 2.2 mil in cash charges expects annual cost savings around four to six mil. So I think
2473.44s:  that that's a big part of the move that you saw today was stemming from this. Let's take a peek
2479.60s:  at the options really fast. Yeah, it's I mean, it's kind of split. Even split calls puts. Doesn't really look
2488.64s:  doesn't really look too great to me. Yeah, interesting. Hard to borrow. That I find also curious.
2497.68s:  And it still is sitting on a market maker move, which is also curious.
2502.88s:  Where are these options at? Let's eyeball it first. 21 feb.
2512.16s:  And 16 Jan, I think those are where we'll see the biggest ones. 9000 there. 7000 there. Yeah,
2521.04s:  so those are definitely the two biggest explorations. For sure.
2528.32s:  A lot upfront in 21 feb and a little bit of call skew there too.
2536.56s:  And then out in 16 Jan, pretty heavy call skew. This starts to look like people are expecting
2544.08s:  a little bit of a turnaround here, which is actually quite logical. If we see something that's
2548.96s:  been punished a lot and we think that it becomes overextended to the downside, we can absolutely
2554.72s:  think about when it might start to make a recovery. And people will try to do that because
2562.24s:  you know, you want a front run. You want to try to get a slightly better price for whatever it
2566.64s:  is that you're getting into. And that's the it seems to be. That's what the the general idea behind
2574.16s:  what I'm seeing here at least. But yeah, I mean, I definitely wouldn't call this up or doing well.
2578.96s:  It had a 2% day, which is completely unremarkable across the board. There was some stuff that actually
2585.36s:  had some really strong moves today. But all that actually reminds me who was that James. Thank you
2591.20s:  for bringing my brain around to this. I needed to set up another screener. So right now,
2600.16s:  I have one that does like a gap up. And I like the gap up that's useful. But I actually want to see
2607.52s:  intraday price moves as well, which I don't have. So we'll do percent change.
2616.56s:  The latest percent change we need options.
2619.84s:  We need total OI. We want OI of at least 2000. And then
2640.16s:  this can be just essentially greater than zero as long as it's greater than zero is fine.
2644.64s:  Let's see what this produces. I don't want this and I don't want
2655.92s:  and then 904.
2662.00s:  And we want this sorted by the percent change. Yeah, cool.
2670.24s:  So we'll save this.
2676.48s:  And then this will come out as an email. We want to sort by percent change, descending.
2682.32s:  This one can come out midday. It'll take the top 25.
2687.12s:  Now this will be a percent change.
2692.32s:  What made me think of this was James, when you were just talking about some of the stuff that
2698.24s:  was moving today because there were quite a few names that were showing like pretty
2703.36s:  pretty significant strength today. So I don't know if you guys saw, but
2709.76s:  ARM. Big gap up. Really, really big gap up. This is a clear breakout, a sustained breakout on volume.
2719.12s:  This is a pretty decent setup. I didn't like the movement coming into it here. So it's not like
2724.80s:  my pick of anything, but this is a pretty, pretty strong gap up. Then there's NNE, not to be confused
2731.84s:  with NEE. And NNE, I also have a position on. I was trading the breakout essentially from here.
2739.36s:  So I'm still just following that breakout, trying to try and following it a little bit because now
2744.24s:  it's firmly broken out. But we'll see how well that holds. Or if we get a short-term turnaround
2750.40s:  and stops us out, Netflix was up 9.7% today. And I think somebody made a comment in the chat before,
2760.40s:  if I'm not mistaken, somewhere different. Dark Mark says Netflix is about to raise rates.
2767.36s:  And I think you guys said, there it is, Roderick, thank you. Roderick was saying Netflix had killer
2771.20s:  subs. So I didn't look through Netflix earnings itself because I honestly don't really care,
2777.20s:  but the market liked it. And it had a really, really strong move today. This is,
2783.60s:  that's a big gap up for a company of this size. And this, I'm actually running a study right now
2790.72s:  on large cap mega cap stocks, mega cap stocks that have outsized earnings releases followed by
2801.12s:  a really strong gap up of at least 5%. And what's the frequency that those follow through
2807.92s:  into post earnings announcement drift? Because for those that don't know, there's a really big series
2813.84s:  where we have long-term post earnings announcement drift that then starts to slow down and contract,
2823.92s:  especially in really big stocks. It's because it has better price information. It's more informative.
2828.88s:  So there's less price shocks. Then we start to see some of these names accelerating in bigger
2837.28s:  ways than the prior research would suggest. So I'm actually in the middle of running a study that
2843.12s:  now specifically on mega cap stocks. That's something that we'll go through on one of like the
2847.68s:  Tuesday or Thursday streams for the pro members to see like just what the output is because once I
2852.56s:  have it, I'm actually very, very curious. My underlying suspicion is that there will be specific
2858.00s:  conditions that we can identify specifically for really big companies, mega caps that if set
2865.36s:  criteria are met, it will have a pretty high probability of going through with drift. Now it's so
2872.80s:  important to not overfit the data in set criteria that just happens to capture the movements. So
2878.72s:  I'm that's the the biggest problem set trying to solve for is like what criteria makes sense? What
2883.52s:  criteria is overall robust, but is not overfit to the data so that we can actually have something
2889.76s:  that's tradable. So I'm starting to think, I really am starting to think that we might see a bit
2895.28s:  of a change in mega cap stocks as far as the receptiveness to post earnings and onsmanship. So
2900.24s:  this is going to be a new add to that. For me to pay attention to because it's a really tradable
2908.48s:  event and the other thing just to summarize a little bit more of that thought is I'm also expanding
2915.68s:  it to the host index. So I want to see if the index shows any price shocks relative to the larger
2925.28s:  components having near term price shocks from something like earnings. So we will see this move
2933.44s:  those really interesting to me because it had obviously an incredibly strong gap up, but I mean,
2939.28s:  it got sold off into that all fucking day, which is not super bullish for like post earnings
2949.76s:  announcement drift. So we will see who really to tell. Cool. We have time for maybe a couple more.
2958.48s:  So anything else you guys want to take a look at? Dark Mark says, thought on
2962.72s:  Palantir earnings in its recent movement. Yeah, let's take a look at Palantir, the LTR.
2971.36s:  Do I still have something on in here? Let me see.
2979.92s:  I am out. I used to have a position on not long ago. I literally took it off today.
2988.48s:  Why did I take that off today? Oh, it says rotating into something else.
2994.32s:  I see. Yeah. So that one I actually had pretty short term options on. So yeah, for Palantir,
3002.56s:  I was in the 21 Feb 55s and I had gotten into those on the 15th year. So really kind of a
3013.44s:  bit of a sad little baby move, but the 10 points is fine with options. You can do okay with moves
3020.40s:  like that. And it's actually still moving in the correct direction. My typical move there would
3025.36s:  actually be to scale off just a little bit and leave some runners on, but it just looks like the
3031.36s:  velocity is slowing down. And there was a couple other things that I really wanted to put on.
3036.88s:  So right now my breakout allocation is essentially redlined. So I needed to take something off in order
3042.40s:  to put on more breakout stuff. The way that I manage the breakout allocations like that is I
3050.40s:  have a total allocation with respect to risk, not the dollar amounts being used.
3056.48s:  And the reason for that is once you have a bigger account, you'll find that your positions are
3061.28s:  going to get stopped out faster in terms of managing risk at half a percent or a percent
3066.80s:  of the total portfolio size as compared to how much money you're going to use to put those positions
3072.80s:  on. So let's say for example, you wanted to use 10% of your portfolio value on that. Well,
3077.92s:  that could put you in front of way more risk than you think you should take given a specific
3083.20s:  strategy. And for me, breakouts, they're really mixed probability traits. I'm typically lower win
3089.68s:  rate, but a much higher severity when I win. So trying to keep it structured that way is really,
3098.40s:  really important. From a long call for the last three months, looking at the last three months,
3107.60s:  the win rate is 48.9% on the breakout specifically. So that means 51% of the time I'm taking down a loss.
3118.24s:  So it's literally the majority of what happens for breakouts. And it's because the loss on breakouts
3124.80s:  is managed really aggressively. And that's designed again to take asymmetric risk. We don't want to,
3132.16s:  well, I should say I in this case, I'm talking about me very specifically here. I don't want to have
3139.60s:  positions where I have a directional thesis specifically for a breakout, which is a very
3145.28s:  specific profit mechanism. You don't need a lot of time to see if you're correct or incorrect on
3149.60s:  a breakout. Like it's going to tell you. So we don't want to spend a bunch of time waiting to
3155.60s:  see if it's correct. And if it starts compounding against you because it's going to be a lower
3160.00s:  probability trade, you have to be really, really thoughtful on managing the risk side of that
3164.72s:  equation because you cannot have a situation where you have a even moderately high loss rates,
3172.32s:  or in my case, for the breakouts for the last three months, in majority, clearly a majority
3177.92s:  loss rate, 51% is a majority of those trades are losses. But they have to be as long as those
3182.80s:  losses are nice and small. And the winners are multiples of those. It's a highly successful
3187.60s:  strategy. But you have to maintain that profile. If that profile changes too much, you're kind of
3193.68s:  fucked. It's not good. So yeah, balance here in the near term, I still think has a way to go.
3201.36s:  And the reason for that is because it needs to get above, again, this local high. Now, it looks
3211.04s:  like it wants to do it. And based on the movement that we saw today, it's placed in a pretty good
3217.44s:  volume note here over the last few days. And then the tick up and volume today. So this looks good
3222.40s:  to me. But you can see all of the different levels that I'm really interested in with respect to
3227.20s:  Palantir. I had also short puts in Palantir that I was trading separately. And that was actually
3236.48s:  getting ready to take on shares potentially, like prospecting to take on shares. That highlights
3242.16s:  a shortfall of selling puts to acquire shares. Because a lot of times you're going to get left
3246.08s:  in the dust. But I think it still has a little ways to go. I think the proving grounds right now
3252.88s:  is above 80. But I think as long as it stays above 74, it looks like it's in a healthy spot to
3259.20s:  consolidate. Even if it trends a little bit sideways here, I still like it way more to the upside
3264.72s:  than to the downside. That's for sure, especially for a longer term play. I still think Palantir
3269.28s:  is positioned so incredibly well across all of its business units that I mean, for a longer term
3278.08s:  thesis, I think it's a pretty easy ticker to like from a longer term perspective.
3286.32s:  Yeah, thanks for bringing up Palantir as well. I like taking a peek. Let's take a quick look at the
3293.20s:  up. Yeah, big calls skew. A lot of them are out in, what is this 18 Ds? 24 Jan 25. 21 Feb 25. So a lot
3309.76s:  of near term, interestingly, we have a bunch of green. What are these greens? 21 March. So it's
3316.40s:  kind of all over the place, which is good. Seeing it all over the place like that is good. It means
3321.52s:  people are playing this to the upside across a lot of different time frames, which is very tradable.
3326.08s:  If you see that kind of movement, then that's what we want. All right, cool. So let me pivot now.
3333.76s:  And I want to do our skill development section for today. And then at the end, we'll still have a
3339.44s:  couple minutes for some more questions and stuff. So if I didn't get a chance to answer whatever
3344.08s:  you want to look at, just bring it up again in a few moments and then we'll die back into it.
3349.04s:  But I want to do our skill dev. And again, this will feed into a case study for tomorrow for
3354.96s:  the pro members. So everybody else that's not there, that's what I want you to focus on is the skill
3361.68s:  itself. And at the end of this, you should have a clear, a clear understanding of what the skill
3370.80s:  is or the topic is that we're talking about. And why it's relevant to you and some ideas on how
3377.84s:  you can use it going forward. That's the important stuff here. So for skill dev today, we already
3385.20s:  talked about it. We're talking about the money mindset. And there's a specific exercise for it,
3390.08s:  but it's not about the money mindset exercise. It's literally just about money mindset. And I
3394.88s:  refer to this as actually an outlier money mindset. And it's just because a lot of people have a
3403.76s:  average disposition towards money. And again, the reason why I say outlier money mindset is it's
3413.60s:  kind of a dual purpose outlier because that's us, that's our community. But then also to signify
3420.16s:  that we have to think about this stuff differently. That's the most important part. That's also why
3427.12s:  the channel is called the outlier trading channel. Because in order to do well at this stuff,
3434.00s:  you literally functionally have to do stuff differently if you want it to work. So let's talk
3440.32s:  about this. Let's talk about this money mindset idea and how to actually use it to do stuff.
3449.52s:  So I'm going to expand this over. And then I think we can, yeah, we can cut this down.
3457.92s:  So you can see the learning objectives are really high level, right? To build a healthy
3463.68s:  disposition towards money, which I regret to inform you, the overwhelming majority of us don't
3469.12s:  have that. I did not even even when I thought I did. So I want to talk about this in that context.
3476.32s:  First thing, let me grab the chat just because I need to use another window and I want to keep an
3481.28s:  eyeball on you guys. So I have a poll to get us started. And let me grab the poll. And I'm going
3492.32s:  to type in our question. How many characters do I get 100?
3496.16s:  It's open ended, but it's yes or no. So the question that I just asked is do you have a healthy
3507.36s:  relationship with money? And that's whatever it means to you, whatever that, whatever that means to
3513.36s:  you. It's not a defined thing. And I don't want it to be defined in this context. I want you to
3521.60s:  think about whatever that means to you and how you feel towards it. That's all that means.
3528.40s:  So when we think about having a healthy relationship with money, there's probably
3534.80s:  handful of things that will come to mind for us, but there's a couple of things that are really,
3539.20s:  really important. So it looks like we have 70, 30 split yes, no. And I am
3547.84s:  interested in both of these responses just to probe just a little bit. So for somebody,
3554.80s:  anybody, if you don't want to answer, you don't have to, but I would love to hear from somebody,
3559.44s:  from the yeses is if you were to summarize how you have a healthy relationship with money,
3568.88s:  how would you summarize it? So like if somebody walked up to you and they said, man,
3573.52s:  I'm trying to have a healthier relationship with money. What's the one sentence thing that you
3578.32s:  would say to them that you think you're doing that is leading to you to having a healthy relationship
3583.92s:  with money? And then for somebody that says, no, what do you think you're missing? So when you're
3592.40s:  analyzing yourself and your relationship with money that's leading you to the conclusion of no
3596.80s:  here, what is it that what is the data point that you're crossing mentally that you're like,
3601.84s:  this is the thing that is fucking me up. I don't understand blank or I think too much about
3608.08s:  this other whatever it is. So I'm interested in both. So travel ursel says for me, healthy in this
3616.00s:  context is that treat it as a tool. Interesting. I kind of like that idea. And I think we can expand on
3623.60s:  that. Okay, so it looks like a lot of you were referring to the healthy relationship in terms of
3628.24s:  budget. So blonde, swazie and matez says, I don't spend more than I earn or more than I have.
3634.96s:  So that's kind of like a budgeting take on it, which I agree with. I don't think there's anything
3639.60s:  wrong with that. So let's as always analyze the landscape. We need to create an orientation for
3648.08s:  ourselves. And the easiest way to do this is to start from the top.
3658.96s:  So the next question for you guys, I'm not going to put it as as a poll because I kind of need
3663.36s:  qualitative answers here. The first very first thing.
3677.92s:  And I'm phrasing it this way purposefully. What is money for? What the fuck is money for? And
3683.68s:  we're not going to spend a lot of time on this esoteric stuff, but I want to I want to get to the
3688.40s:  brass tax of what this is. James says the more redistributed the more that it comes back, it's weird,
3695.52s:  but it works. I think that's actually a bit of a perspective skew to be honest. I don't think that
3702.40s:  that functionally is like I would challenge that from a functional perspective. Now I want to be
3711.60s:  clear. I actually fully agree with you, but I think it's more I think that's more of a
3716.88s:  perspective than a functional component. Here's why I say that because my mom is one of those
3723.84s:  people that for a long time, she did not have much money. And she was still as giving with her money
3734.80s:  as she could be. She was too giving. She gave money that she didn't fucking have. So I think for
3740.64s:  somebody like that, I think you actually can run into a bit of a scenario where the more you
3747.36s:  distribute it, the more it comes back, it's not inherently so. But I truly understand the
3752.88s:  sensation that you're talking about. And I really do agree with it. But I just think it's important
3758.00s:  to understand that we're probably talking about it from a perspective more than anything else.
3763.20s:  Let's see what we think money is for.
3772.00s:  H says using money as leverage for a happy, for a healthy and happy life instead of letting it be
3777.68s:  a stressor. Okay. This way says I spend money in things that are important to me and I don't
3783.12s:  allow some amount of debt. And I don't allow some amount of debt still allow me to sleep at night.
3792.88s:  Tommy says I said no missing not knowing how much money my future self will need after
3798.24s:  retire. Okay, got it. So for for Tommy, it sounds like we need to do a roadmap analysis. That's
3805.92s:  what the fix is there. So for Tommy's for Tommy's element is essentially running the millionaire
3817.92s:  roadmap. I'm looking to grab the millionaire roadmap. Here you go. Millionaire roadmap.
3836.08s:  And the millionaire roadmap, that's just a video for for everybody. But the premise behind the
3840.32s:  video is to help you contextualize what we spend on where we're trying to go and then to create
3849.84s:  gap fill. How do we get to where we're trying to go from where we are today? But so starting from
3856.56s:  an ultra high level, what is money for? Oops, I need to change my little tool.
3871.28s:  We used to exchange value via a bartering system. I have a skill. I use my skill to help you.
3888.96s:  You have a skill. You use your skill to help me. I can teach people how to trade. I love
3894.80s:  teaching and I love trading. I've spent the majority of my adult life on this. I'm not good
3900.88s:  at everything. So when I fucked up my back and I've worked through my working through the
3905.76s:  herniated disk that I'm still working through, I flew from California to Florida to go see a specific
3913.44s:  dude who is done with the spine and rehab, what I have done with trading. The difference is when
3922.48s:  I got to him, I didn't really get there. I didn't come there and help him out with a bunch of
3929.36s:  his shit. Although I tried, I always try to add value specifically from a content creation
3933.28s:  standpoint because he's getting on YouTube and stuff. But that stuff aside, what I gave him was
3939.28s:  something else, a standardized bartering tool because I have accumulated money doing other things
3945.44s:  and then I can give money to him so that he can do shit that he wants to do with the money.
3950.24s:  Even if there's not a direct transfer of skills between us, if there's no liquidity otherwise,
3956.48s:  money is essentially the bartering system on Roids in so far as it provides liquidity. Because if you
3963.12s:  go to a baker and the baker doesn't need shit from you, you can't really do a bartering exchange
3968.80s:  there, but you can give them money so that they can go do whatever the fuck they need. So the premise
3974.96s:  here is money is literally in exchange. That's all it is. And the way we get money is through expertise.
3986.96s:  Effort and time. Your money represents that stuff. Now, not all people's spent time, not
4000.48s:  all people's spent effort, not all people's spent expertise is valued the same. That's the reality
4007.20s:  of life. There are people that are working construction jobs that work objectively light years
4014.00s:  harder than other people in office jobs who make light years more money. The reason why this is
4021.36s:  important for you to understand and acknowledge is because as we go through the rest of this exercise,
4027.20s:  part of what we need to understand is how do we
4038.56s:  create abundance. This is the objective. This is the outlier objective with respect to money.
4048.32s:  And I have somebody scratching at the door. I think you know who.
4057.04s:  So just as we were just able to get Thor a brand new play rug, his last play rug was getting a
4072.88s:  little worn out. That takes money. However, if you don't have abundance spending money on a new
4080.40s:  play rug for your dog is completely nonsensical. And it's the absolute worst possible way to spend
4088.08s:  your money probably. But we think it's worth it because the portfolio manager here likes it. It's
4094.88s:  actually so funny that on the video, you guys can't even see like his facial features and stuff
4100.64s:  because he's too dark. This is actually hilarious. You can't see anything.
4106.80s:  They can't see you. Look up here. Look, see as a face, he will fight. This is what we talk about the more
4120.24s:  rate yield. So he does just like a little bit of a mouth, mouth open thing. That's his attack. That's his
4129.12s:  attack vibe. Look at those chompers. You see these teeth? Look at these teeth. Look at that tooth.
4136.88s:  Nice. Nice. You got chompers.
4148.00s:  Get my ugly face out of the way. Get back to this.
4151.28s:  So when it comes to money, one of the easiest things you can set your sights on right in the
4159.44s:  beginning is to create abundance. Now in order to create abundance, a lot of things have to happen.
4166.48s:  And let's talk about what those things are. What I want to grab is this, which is just like a
4175.92s:  general overview of two things worth our discussion.
4190.40s:  So we just talked about this idea of abundance. The reason why abundance is so important is because
4197.68s:  when you have abundance that comment somebody made earlier, that's really, really accurate is
4207.04s:  that money becomes an accelerator. And for a lot of people, if you think about what are the most
4212.48s:  common sources of friction within a family, within a marriage, money is typically one of the very
4217.12s:  top ones. Let's actually see. Let's put it. I'm genuinely curious. So what are the
4223.60s:  top most common causes of fights between family?
4237.04s:  Very first one, finances. Finances, financial concerns.
4246.72s:  I think I don't think this shocks anybody. And it's because most of us, if you're anything like
4252.48s:  me, which I imagine a lot of us are, you're anything like me when you don't grow up with a bunch
4257.84s:  of money, it's a source of fucking friction because you are dealing with a exceedingly valuable
4263.36s:  but finite resource. That's difficult. So abundance overrides all of that. And I've used a few
4276.40s:  example of this before, but to move on from this point, but to leave you with something.
4282.00s:  When I used to get something, I used to work really hard. And when I would get something, I would
4289.52s:  obsessively take care of it. And that's actually, I argue, a good, a good habit, to be honest.
4296.08s:  I don't think that's a bad habit, but there was an unhealthy side to it. The unhealthy side to it
4302.48s:  was I would be so obsessive over the thing and trying to take really good care of it.
4308.40s:  And that it would start to make people feel uncomfortable being around the thing. Like in my car,
4315.36s:  I still actually do, you can't eat in the car. There's no eating in the fucking car. You can
4318.56s:  eat when you get out. But there's other things about the car that don't bother me as much now.
4325.92s:  And it's because I can wash it myself. Or if I'm busy, I can pay somebody to wash it.
4331.04s:  Like there's little things like that. So it allows you, once you reach abundance first,
4341.36s:  to have healthier relationships with people. Because another thing that literally never happens
4348.72s:  is if I go out to eat with my friends, I will always pay. I will always pay. And I couldn't
4357.36s:  possibly care less genuinely. If anybody, I don't even ask, there is no, don't forget to
4362.32s:  vent, Mommy. Here's my cash app. Paypal me this. There's none of that. I don't fucking care.
4368.96s:  I don't care at all. Now, I've told you guys this story before because it's pertinent because if
4373.28s:  you have good friends, they all end up sending me money anyways. And a lot of times they fucking
4378.24s:  send me too much for themselves. And I literally have to refund them because they start paying what
4383.36s:  my share like genuinely should have been. But that's just when you have friends that actually
4390.32s:  care about you and they don't care that I have money. And they're not trying to take advantage
4394.80s:  of me because I have money. They don't even really care to take it. They want to pay their equal way.
4399.84s:  Point being, if you have abundance, it will ease literally all of your relationships immediately.
4407.04s:  The second thing is when you have abundance, you get to express yourself in the purest form,
4418.56s:  the purest form. That is true freedom. What's not true freedom is if you have to do things a certain
4430.00s:  way in order to appease somebody else in order to still be able to make money. And it's something we
4438.32s:  all have to put up with for a while. I think it's an important thing to put up with. It helps build
4442.32s:  some character. But it starts to become a real drag when you have to start sacrificing your personal
4451.12s:  morals, values and standards in order to keep a job to keep working out where you are. Abundance,
4459.12s:  it's rid of that. That doesn't mean that you're an asshole. It doesn't mean that you get to be an
4462.72s:  asshole. You don't get to be an asshole. You still have to be a good person. But it does mean that if
4467.92s:  something is going on that directly conflicts with your values, you do not have to bend to them.
4478.00s:  You can stand up and it doesn't mean you have to quit. But you can stand up and talk about it at
4483.68s:  least. You can say, I don't agree with what we're doing here or I don't agree with this for this
4487.84s:  reason. And then you can do that with an open conscious and open heart and accept the potential
4494.08s:  consequences because some places don't like that. So abundance enables this second component
4501.52s:  unequivocally, which is not freedom in terms of not being able to work. I've talked about this
4506.40s:  before, but this is probably one of the most, it's probably one of the most misconceived notions
4512.56s:  that exist. And it happens when all of us are poor. And when we're poor, we think once we have
4518.64s:  a bunch of money, we're not going to do anything. We're just going to sit on the beach all day,
4523.12s:  sip my ties and then just live life like that. And funny enough,
4533.36s:  one of the things that I found, once I started having more and more money, is I found myself
4540.08s:  able to work on things that I care about more and more. And then I started looking at how much
4545.76s:  I'm working and I literally started working way more when I had money way more. And there's a
4554.80s:  reason why it's because you don't have to trade your time for money from a pure time for money
4563.84s:  trade off. You can accept slightly less money or no money and spend your time working on things
4571.84s:  that you genuinely care about and genuinely value. That is freedom. Freedom in my opinion is not
4582.08s:  being a lazy citizen that has a bunch of money that just spends money on a bunch of material
4586.56s:  things and you're just in it for yourself. I still think we should all be contributors to society.
4593.04s:  Now, Admin note, this is Eric's opinion. This really is not anything you should take that seriously.
4600.08s:  But the freedom element is an objective truth. If you have abundance, you have true freedom.
4606.16s:  You have freedom of expression. You have freedom to spend your time, your most valuable asset
4611.28s:  working on the things that you like. And that leads into the third thing. Money as a reminder
4616.72s:  is an amplifier. Money will not make you happy. It literally won't. I'm telling you it won't.
4622.00s:  And there's this hilarious thing, a hilarious thing that happens. You're just about all of us
4629.76s:  that end up making, again, I'm a peasant compared to some of the people that I talk to. Like
4634.72s:  somebody like Tom Sausanov, he's literally hundreds of millions of dollars. I don't know if he's
4640.96s:  a billionaire. He might be. He might be close to it. But he's done hundreds of millions of dollars
4648.00s:  from business sales themselves, not trading, not any of his actual income from a job.
4653.12s:  So the funny thing is, and I've learned this, and it didn't make sense to me for a long time.
4659.52s:  But it's actually funny because now I understand it. And when people have a lot of money,
4665.52s:  they say money doesn't matter. But guess what happens if you don't have money?
4672.48s:  That's about all you can fucking think about. So money is this really interesting thing
4679.44s:  that once you have it, you have enough, you actually devalue it. It's not that important anymore
4686.16s:  because you're able to do things the way you want, live your life the way you want,
4689.76s:  and do the stuff that you care about. So from an amplification standpoint,
4695.52s:  money allows you to literally amplify anything you're doing in a positive way.
4703.68s:  And it doesn't have to be done so in that if I'm going to go on a boat ride to Catalina,
4710.40s:  because it's a cool island nearby us here, that when I go for the boat ride, I'm going to have to
4715.44s:  get a mega yacht now just because I want a bigger boat for me and my wife to go.
4720.40s:  Right. It doesn't have to be that, but it can be while I'm on the boat that we charter to go
4725.12s:  because we prefer to be by ourselves because we're fucking hermits, believe it or not,
4729.44s:  that when we're on the boat, we can be really nice to the people that are helping us get there.
4734.88s:  And we can tip them well when we get there. We can offer to buy them lunch. We can make
4741.60s:  somebody else's day a little bit brighter. And for me, that brings me a tremendous amount of joy,
4748.24s:  genuinely, a tremendous amount of joy. Another way for me specifically is it allows me to do this.
4758.72s:  It allows me to share my experience and my skillset broadly with everybody for free.
4766.40s:  And it allows me to do it in accordance with my values. Because if we take a quick stroll,
4774.96s:  let's just take a look. I'm going to grab a incognito window again, just so that it's not
4782.16s:  adulterate by anything that I have. Let's go to YouTube and let's look at options.
4791.84s:  Let's see. So we got this one. I don't know this. I don't even know this, dude, but this looks good.
4799.04s:  Oh, let's see. I'm just seeing what the first.
4809.92s:  Yeah, it's okay. This looks fine. This looks fine. This looks fine. This looks fine. This looks fine.
4816.96s:  Shout out to our boy Benjamin. I have a call with him tomorrow. We talk every week. He's the homie.
4822.56s:  But you should definitely check out his works. He's fucking hilarious.
4826.96s:  And here we go. So which one is this? This is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, eight videos in.
4836.24s:  And we see options trading in 10 minutes. How to make a thousand a day for beginners own.
4843.68s:  Now the reality is that video is going to get clicks. It is unequivocally going to get clicks because
4852.96s:  doesn't want that. But the reality is is that it's not really representative of what this looks like.
4863.92s:  Same thing with looking at a couple of these. They made a million off of some Tesla calls.
4869.36s:  There's a bunch of different videos like that that you can see in here. So this person is talking
4875.12s:  about making 270% in a day. How to get big profits, simple strategy for beginners, make big profit.
4882.64s:  How we made $400, $4800 in a day sitting on a private jet with like a gold fucking, a gold champagne bottle.
4894.00s:  Trading became easy. They cracked the code. That's pretty awesome. Trading does become easy, though. That's
4899.12s:  actually, that's like legitimately true. This dude's talking about is 4689 and 13 minutes. I'm not
4905.36s:  trash talking. These things in and of themselves. Because I have made equivalent to a lot of these
4914.80s:  actually in different time frames. So the point is you can make a bunch of money. But the reality
4922.72s:  is the majority of these people are tailoring these kinds of videos because they do well.
4928.72s:  And they do well because they prey on people. And that's what performs well. Meanwhile, I'm here.
4934.96s:  What is it? 1815 on what is today? Who's day? Wednesday? Wednesday night with 42 people on a
4942.80s:  live stream. I literally couldn't be happier. I literally couldn't be happier doing this with you
4946.96s:  right now. The only way that that's possible, though, is because fortunately, I have some money.
4955.68s:  If you don't have money, you can't do this. Like this becomes untenable as a business model.
4961.76s:  And I've made this clear with how much I make off of YouTube. The amount that I make off of
4966.32s:  YouTube compared to the amount of effort in is literally disgusting. Meaning it's not good.
4970.88s:  It's fucking terrible. I make very little money off of YouTube. So if I was trying to do YouTube
4977.28s:  as my actual income source to actually make money, like my friend Benjamin.
4983.92s:  And Benjamin does really well. 2.2 million views. But guess what? When Benjamin is making this
4990.88s:  kind of video, he has to make it from the perspective of what will do well. And he actually will
4998.16s:  talk to you a little bit about him. I'm not going to talk about a bunch of his business.
5002.08s:  But we know that if you're doing something in a way, optimizing it for what's going to do well
5009.52s:  versus what allows you to express yourself as you want, there's still a constraint there.
5015.76s:  So he does a great job and he makes incredibly good videos. But he still has to keep that in mind
5022.64s:  because that's a big part of how he makes a living. So he has to be careful about it.
5027.52s:  So this goes all the way back to it being an amplifier. It allows you to spend your time on things
5035.28s:  that you care about. It allows you to spend time on things that you value. It allows you to truly
5041.44s:  be free and do things in a way that you think are best.
5049.28s:  Okay. Next, robustness, the concept of robustness really comes back to this idea of abundance.
5062.00s:  But robustness is that we have a defined system, a defined plan that is sustainable.
5072.32s:  So first, if I think about the different ways that somebody can make money. You can make money
5084.56s:  from a W2. You can make it from contracting. You can make it from freelancing. You can make it from
5092.88s:  side hustle. These are things where you're exchanging like your primary time. Then there are passive
5101.04s:  things that you can do in conjunction or active alongside it. You can have different kinds of
5105.76s:  investing. Investing breaks down into a bunch of buckets. You can have real estate. You can have buy
5113.84s:  and hold. You can have crypto, which kind of fits into this. I don't know why that gets its own bucket,
5120.40s:  but it does for now. You can have, I've used this one before because I find it so interesting,
5126.32s:  sneakers. You can trade. So you can have other ways to build an income. It's funny because a lot
5133.44s:  of times people will say, like Eric, if you make so much money and stuff, like why do you even have
5137.92s:  a Patreon, which is literally it's a great question. The reason is because I spend so much time
5144.56s:  sharing all of this genuinely really hard earned experience and knowledge. And I spend so much of it
5153.20s:  for completely free, but there's still cost associated not just with my time. There's cost
5159.92s:  associated with maintaining an email, a website, paying video editors. So not only am I spending
5167.52s:  my time, which is genuinely my most valuable resource, and sharing an experience that sharing
5174.40s:  experience that has taken me now 18 years to develop, just doing that pro bono essentially.
5181.92s:  And then you layer on top of the cost, like I refuse to pay into this thing on top of all that.
5187.20s:  Like that's just fucking dumb. And it's not robust. This is why you see people with a lot of money
5196.40s:  that still do things to make more money. It's because in order to do things, you have to have
5204.24s:  a certain amount of resources. And the robustness aspect is to make sure that you can continue doing
5211.84s:  what you love. If what you're doing is feeble, then you have a problem. So when we're talking
5218.24s:  about robustness, when it comes to the money mindset and the money mindset exercises, it's having
5224.00s:  multiple irons in the fire. You choose your own adventure. You can have as many of these or as
5228.64s:  few of these as you want, but you can't have too few because there's a reality that we have to
5233.04s:  discuss that's ugly. If you're like most people, the average, you have a W2. And then if you're
5239.20s:  like most people, you have maybe a retirement count, which you can't really touch, but you could,
5244.88s:  it's just going to be penalized. Your W2, this is one bad boss. I don't know what I'm going to do.
5255.92s:  Bad twice, one bad boss, one bad fiscal year, one bad project,
5266.96s:  one unfortunate accident,
5272.16s:  away from not fucking being there. This is not robust. This is a unbelievable
5283.52s:  single point of failure. Literally, your livelihood is attached to this one fucking single
5290.96s:  point of failure. Unwise, you don't get to control this. You cannot have a single point of failure.
5301.04s:  Okay. So now I want to start talking about the actual money mindset exercise. And again,
5307.52s:  we're going to do an actual case study tomorrow, but I want to give people the tools to essentially
5313.68s:  do your own case study for yourself if you prefer that. So the first thing is understanding,
5319.36s:  and this is the first portion of the money mindset exercise is this, marginal utility,
5327.12s:  maximum utility. What this means is we are taught from times of being little tiny kids. This is
5337.68s:  one of the hindrances that we're going to talk about. We're taught from the time that you're a
5343.44s:  little kid, but there are certain things that you're supposed to value. You're supposed to care about.
5348.64s:  And one of the signs that you made it is you have a nice car. Another sign that you made it is
5352.56s:  you have a nice watch and all this other bullshit. The reality is that starts to become
5359.52s:  society's imprint on you of what society says you should value. Now, this is not to suggest that
5369.44s:  society's inclusion here is all bad. It's not because there's a social contract. You can learn
5376.88s:  a lot from that social contract, but you cannot get to the point where whatever society is valuing
5386.16s:  starts to overwhelm what you actually value, what you personally value. So the marginal utility,
5395.92s:  the money mindset and marginal utility exercise, that's what is actually called in its entirety,
5401.36s:  is designed to help us identify what, I don't know why there's an E after what, what we truly value.
5419.04s:  And the reason why I emphasize this idea of what we truly value is because it gets rid of this
5423.76s:  judgment, self and external. Forms of self-judgment essentially place both of these actually combined
5438.24s:  first place of glass ceiling on your performance. Now for me, a form of self-judgment is I used to say
5450.08s:  I used to say this all the time actually. I used to say people who buy designer clothes are dumb.
5456.88s:  I'd say if you spend that much money on a designer clothing brand, when you can get a cheaper
5462.00s:  version, like you're just dumb, right? You're just spending money on the same fabric on the same
5466.56s:  thing. That is a poor person's understanding of the world. That was my understanding of the world.
5473.52s:  And I used to say stuff like that because it helped me feel better about where I was at in life
5481.76s:  and where I was likely to end up in life. So this idea of rich people are dumb, rich people
5494.24s:  are selfish, rich people are blank. What we're doing is we're literally, we're applying this
5502.08s:  insane mental manipulation. We're taking an entire category of people. We're making entire
5508.40s:  judgments about them and typically they're not nice judgments and think of what that does. Does
5513.60s:  that make you aspire to be like that? Of course not. Why would we aspire to be dumb? Why would we
5520.40s:  aspire to be selfish? We don't. But we say these things about this class of people and it starts to
5526.32s:  literally create a cognitive dissonance in the old brain, in the old brain housing group,
5532.56s:  where we subconsciously will say, well, I don't want to be that because it's all of these nasty
5538.96s:  things that I evaluate. It's pure fucking bullshit because here's what I've come to learn once I
5545.44s:  developed money. Here's the big secret. The person that has money gets to pick what the fuck they
5552.16s:  want to spend their money on. If they choose to spend their money on designer clothing, which I
5557.68s:  don't get, they're fucking choice because guess what? They've built the abundance to be able to
5563.92s:  willingly pay $200 for a t-shirt that they know costs $16 to make maximum, including the designer
5572.64s:  prices for the design on the shirt. That's the self limiting side of this. We do it in all sorts of
5581.60s:  ways. We do it in other ways where we say things like, I don't need this. I don't need blank. I don't
5590.80s:  need much. Now, there is a insanely delicate balance that has to happen between, and this is
5599.92s:  something I've reconciled with myself, and I'm not done yet, actually. This is something that's
5603.60s:  ongoing for me because I'm a big student of stoicism and stoicism preaches expectation management.
5611.60s:  Stoicism preaches that we should be content with what we have now, and that one of the largest
5617.12s:  sources of dis-ease, not disease being sick, but dis-ease being not at ease, is the gap between where
5625.04s:  we are and what we train ourselves to want. I think that makes a lot of sense, actually really
5632.40s:  enlightening. I also don't fully agree with it because I think that kind of dis-ease causes
5642.08s:  action. It causes us to do things if we're uncomfortable. I think a certain amount of dis-ease
5649.36s:  is needed to precipitate action to cause people to do things. Back to this glass ceiling thing.
5657.60s:  If you're taught to be too content with where you are with what you have,
5661.68s:  then it tends to lead to complacency, not looking for more. That doesn't mean the inverse.
5668.64s:  In my opinion, the way to balance this is we should continually remind ourselves to be
5674.80s:  exceedingly thankful for where you are. We're all lucky in a lot of different ways.
5679.60s:  This is one of the things that I find so funny when I tell people like, oh, I have a herniated
5683.20s:  disc and it's literally been now six months that I can't bend forward at the hips. That kind of
5690.16s:  sucks. People are always just like, oh, my God, that's so bad that sucks. I appreciate the empathy.
5695.68s:  I appreciate the gesture, but I always remind them. If I could wave a wand and have a different
5702.88s:  past six months than what it's been, I don't think I would. I genuinely don't think I would.
5707.20s:  And it's because it's taught me so much. It's made me think about things in such a different way.
5712.64s:  And not to go super far down a rabbit hole, but it's helped me understand my dad and like my
5717.44s:  biological dad and all of his bad behaviors, his alcoholism, all the stuff that he did that as a young
5723.20s:  man, I didn't understand and judged him too hard for. It's made me understand all of that much better.
5728.16s:  So back to this broader idea, though, of these glass ceilings is that most of the glass
5736.96s:  ceilings that you're going to come across are things that you put on yourself. And we should be
5741.68s:  exceedingly thankful for where we're at, for the luck, for the fortune, for the work that we've
5746.80s:  put in that landed us where we are today. But in my opinion, that does not mean that we can't be
5752.00s:  hungry to grow and try to build abundance. It just needs to be tempered. That's my opinion.
5757.92s:  So a big common hindrance, though, are these different kind of self-judgments,
5764.08s:  external judgments that manifest as glass ceiling. And then it becomes this thing where subconsciously,
5770.40s:  there's a big gap between where you are and where, quote unquote, rich is in your opinion of it.
5777.44s:  And that subconscious brain is so powerful. It's going to, it's literally going to prime all of your
5782.88s:  actions, what they are, what they do, how you behave. And if you behave in a way where it's like,
5790.88s:  yeah, you know, I don't care about being rich. That's just dumb. It's just excess. That's just selfish.
5796.32s:  Then you're literally going to take a bunch of subconscious actions that don't lead you there
5800.24s:  because you don't value it. You don't care about it. I think that you can be an insanely impactful
5807.60s:  and helpful rich person. And everybody should be that. Everybody in our community should look
5813.04s:  to be exactly that. You should look to be an outlier rich person. People that behave differently.
5821.28s:  That's what we're here to do. So now let's talk about the last hindrance, which is this near-term
5827.36s:  expectation. This is where we weigh overly weight, the near-term outcome of spending, or the near-term
5838.40s:  outcome of how we spend our time. And this completely derails the longer-term objective of where
5847.52s:  you're ultimately trying to get. The funny thing about this is that the more you sacrifice and the
5853.68s:  earlier you do it, ultimately, the earlier you get the reward, but you have to sacrifice and embrace
5860.88s:  the laid gratification early. So to recap, what an outlier mindset is. It's a different way of thinking.
5870.08s:  It's a different way of thinking about money, and it's a different way of thinking about your
5874.24s:  relationship with money. It's the pursuit of healthy abundance. It's understanding that money
5883.36s:  provides true freedom. It does not provide happiness, but it's an amplifier for everything else
5890.88s:  that you choose to do. Some of the most common hindrances to developing this are self-imposed.
5897.92s:  It's through judgment. It's through the internalization of external factors, societal pressures,
5903.76s:  family pressures. There's another thing I see all the time where people are like, well,
5907.92s:  you know, I don't want to get too much money because then everybody's going to bother me for it.
5912.56s:  The fuck does that say about the friends you have? If that's the case, that's already showing you
5917.28s:  that you have a fucking cancer around you that you need to fix without money. The fuck. So
5923.60s:  that judgment can be the internalization of external factors. It can be external factors,
5928.16s:  or it can be purely self-imposed. But we have to start stripping away those judgments and those
5934.80s:  judgment statements that we say because it primes our subconscious brain. What this means is if
5942.72s:  before, when I would say designer clothes are dumb, anybody that buys designer clothes are dumb
5948.00s:  because it's just spending more on the same thing you could get, I started thinking of it differently
5952.48s:  and started thinking they've made enough money to be able to spend the money on whatever the
5956.80s:  fuck they want. That's pretty cool. That doesn't seem so dumb to me. Now, there's the reality where
5965.04s:  a lot of people like to present themselves as being way wealthier than they are. That's another
5970.56s:  common thing. But that's a completely different thing. This is the other thing that poor people do
5975.52s:  where they say, oh, rich people don't spend money on that. Real rich people are in a Toyota
5979.92s:  Corolla. They're fucking not. They don't know they're fucking not. I know quite a few of them at
5985.12s:  this point. Fucking not. One of my business partners who's actually the dad of one of my friends
5991.84s:  accidentally forgot that he put a weight, he put a bid on this tricked out Ford Bronco Raptor.
6002.08s:  Literally forgot about it. And then he got an email that he wanted. He's like, oh, shit,
6006.64s:  I have to arrange delivery for this car. That's like a different amount of money to like
6014.16s:  put a weight to put a bid on something that's, I mean, it's not super expensive, but it's not
6018.24s:  cheap to put a bid on something like that. Just fucking forget about it until you get the email
6023.20s:  that you want it. That's hilarious. But that's when people say shit like that, oh, rich people don't
6030.80s:  spend on blank. It's good. It goes back to this thing, which is your homework, which is the
6037.52s:  culmination of this entire skill development section, which is understanding your personal
6046.88s:  marginal utility or things. And when I say things, I don't just mean objects. I don't mean
6056.08s:  what you can spend your money on. I mean what you value spending your time on. What you value
6063.36s:  materially. What you value in materially in terms of society or in terms of causes that you care
6071.76s:  about. So there's an exercise that I built specifically for myself originally. It's called
6079.84s:  the money mindset margin utility exercise. And what I did was give myself a few scenarios to play
6086.72s:  through. And I'm going to give you a small outline of it here for those that are in the Patreon.
6092.16s:  There's a download that's available to you. It's in the shop. Everybody that's in the Patreon
6096.56s:  gets it for free. 99. But if you're not in there, don't fret. You literally can build your own
6102.96s:  like this. The first thing I did is I created three scenarios.
6113.60s:  We have one revival or kind of minimum needs.
6123.04s:  We have two, which is crack or current path. And then we have three, which is overwhelming
6137.76s:  abundance. So what I do here is then I paint a series of, I guess if I'm going to call these
6150.16s:  scenarios, I should call these down here like situations. I gave myself different situations.
6157.20s:  So I would have things like material situations. I would have time situations. I would have priority
6165.76s:  situations. I would have what the fuck would I call it? What the fuck would I call it? I'm priority
6180.32s:  like shit that you care about. I don't know what to call that. But it's like the stuff that you
6187.92s:  it's like if you care about causes and stuff like that, what the fuck would I call that?
6199.36s:  Value that's the only thing that was coming into my mind. So yeah, I think that's good. Thank you
6204.72s:  Rodrick for helping me out there. But like value, I think that's exactly correct.
6211.52s:  So then what I did in each of these is I came up with a series of questions. So for example,
6217.04s:  one of the material questions is
6221.92s:  buying a jet. What I do before I go through all of these is I fully adopt
6235.12s:  the scenario. So what I mean by that is I sit down by myself and I think of not things that I
6245.52s:  would like to have, but I think about literally survival. I think about the things that I would need
6253.36s:  in order to literally survive. Material, buy a jet survival. Absolutely not. No way. Don't care.
6263.52s:  Then what I do is I adopt. I keep this scenario in my brain and I go through all of these cases.
6278.96s:  So I spend a few moments truly adopting the scenario as my paradigm, as my current state.
6286.48s:  And then I go through all of these.
6291.04s:  Rodrick says if it flies, floats or fox just rent it. So fantastic statement, but it's another
6297.12s:  poor person statement. I get it. But it's another poor person statement. Oh, it's dinner time.
6305.12s:  Let me get
6308.00s:  because Rodrick, don't forget the Russian rental wife thing. I think that's still a thing.
6315.52s:  You just buy a Russian wife. Well, I don't know. There might be, it might be difficult to do that now
6319.76s:  with all the, you know, all the hubbub between Russian Ukraine. That's kind of a kind of an unfortunate
6327.04s:  outcome of that if you ask me, but I mean, I'm not trying to rent the Russian rental wife. I'd rather
6333.44s:  just buy. I don't know. That sounds better to me. Just my point. Oh, too.
6342.40s:  Let me get the rest of my dinner order.
6353.20s:  Oh, here we go. Okay, cool. Sorry. Thanks.
6359.20s:  So now I go through all of those, I go through all of these cases with that scenario as my scenario.
6367.04s:  Then I switch scenarios. I say, I'm on my current path. Whatever my current value is now,
6374.40s:  whatever the current run rate because you all should have done the millionaire roadmap,
6381.28s:  which again, that's the video I shared earlier. I'll share it again really quick.
6385.44s:  If you haven't done the millionaire road mapping, like there's not, you're like, you're fucked,
6390.08s:  because you have no understanding of what you're trying to do now and how that feeds into
6396.88s:  your broader objectives.
6402.00s:  Rointit, he says money corrupt. See, like, that's another poor person. It is, like, that's
6406.48s:  objectively another poor person statement. I understand your point and money can corrupt.
6411.84s:  But guess what also corrupts? Lack of money. Because who are the people that are breaking into
6418.24s:  people's houses? Who are the people that are trying to rob people, the people without fucking money?
6425.04s:  So again, and this is my exact point. I'm glad that you brought that up.
6428.88s:  Rointit is again, it's because we as poor people, which I mean, I still have that part of my brain,
6437.12s:  we say shit like that because it still makes us feel better about our current scenario.
6443.04s:  But it's just what poor people say to play keep themselves.
6448.56s:  Money can absolutely corrupt. I agree with you. But if you don't have money, that also can
6458.16s:  corrupt. Rointit, he says, but look at the richest man on the planet throwing salutes while he's
6463.84s:  drunk with power. Sorry, not sorry. Again, I don't care to get into any of that. That doesn't matter.
6469.92s:  Just because you might not like Elon, that's okay. You cannot like Elon that doesn't make having
6475.52s:  money bad. That also doesn't make money corrupting people as a generalized rule.
6483.36s:  Like that's the, that's just the reality of it. Again, I don't agree with your
6489.36s:  with your assessment of that. But that doesn't like my opinion there doesn't matter really nor does
6494.96s:  yours. Your opinion is whatever it is and you should have it. You're entitled to have it. But
6500.64s:  the broader point that I'm making is that that's not money. Money doesn't inherently corrupt or
6507.68s:  not corrupt. It's the person because there's plenty of poor people that don't rob people.
6513.44s:  There's also plenty of poor people who do rob people. So yeah,
6523.12s:  we'll start just as he was just really excited. I don't think that that was a fucking Nazi
6527.44s:  salute. Like it's crazy that people are taking it that way. But what happens is when people don't
6533.20s:  like somebody, they will interpret everything they do in the worst light possible. That's standard
6538.16s:  fair. People do it with people on the right. People do it with people on the left. But anyways,
6544.56s:  no need to dive into that. Everybody should have their opinion. That's the takeaway there.
6549.36s:  Everybody should have their own opinion and that's okay. So we go through all of these. After
6555.84s:  doing that millionaire roadmap, which I threw in the chat again, we now understand our track
6562.32s:  what our current path is. And then we go through this same series of questions. We say,
6570.00s:  do I want to buy a jet on my current path? Maybe, maybe not. Kind of depends on what the trade-off
6576.80s:  would be. So probably not for most people. Then we go through overwhelming abundance. Now, when
6584.80s:  I did this, I did it in order of one, three, two, this order. I guess I should write it out here.
6593.92s:  One, three, two, one, three. The purpose of doing it in order of one, three, two,
6600.40s:  is one helps us understand how fucking good we have it and how thankful we are to be here.
6606.40s:  Three gives us the context of if you had essentially unlimited resources.
6613.84s:  Would you do this? So say, for example, if I was a hundred billionaire, would I buy a jet
6618.00s:  apps a fucking loop? I would. I absolutely would. Why the fuck would not? That would be great.
6623.28s:  Instead of having to fly commercial to go places that I want to be able to have jets that I can
6628.00s:  fly via far direct with my wife, my dog, and go wherever we want. That is very cool.
6634.96s:  So poor Eric would say, no, I don't like that. I don't want to do that because buying a jet
6643.20s:  is a lot to keep up with. It's annoying. It's just stuff to play Kate me and make myself feel
6651.04s:  feel better. But in this scenario of having overwhelming abundance, 100 billion of dollars,
6656.16s:  hundreds of billions of dollars. Sure. Of course, I get the fucking jet. I get the yacht too. Why not?
6661.12s:  There's no reason. There's no reason not to have the yacht if I don't want. I can get the yacht.
6666.96s:  I don't have to use it myself. I'm not going to be on the yacht all the time. That's what I use to
6670.08s:  tell myself, why would I get a yacht? I don't want a yacht because I wouldn't be on it all the time.
6674.88s:  I'd spend most of its time just sitting there. That's a waste. Guess what you can do if you have a
6678.00s:  bunch of money. If you have true abundance, let your friends use it. Let other people use it.
6686.80s:  Share it with other people. So again, when we're going through this exercise, we have to be so
6694.80s:  cautious of all of these little things that we've put up in front of ourselves to make ourselves feel
6699.76s:  better for where we are and to essentially cast this idea of being rich and having true abundance
6705.76s:  is being bad because it's not. So as we go through the money mindset exercise,
6715.04s:  here is the ultimate output. Once you create the different material questions that you might ask
6722.32s:  yourself, and I think probably 10 to 15 per one of these is good. So a good example for time is what
6728.96s:  I have a job. For priorities, this is things like would I value health?
6744.32s:  Verse work. I guess we can just bundle values into priorities because the other thing that would be
6760.88s:  here is like what causes do I care about? That kind of thing. So as we go through all of these,
6778.56s:  we should have 10 to 15 situations for each case that we run through in the scenarios.
6785.44s:  And the ultimate output of doing this, and this is again, the exercise that you guys should do,
6791.60s:  I'll actually write it out so that you can take a screenshot. It might be a little easier. I'll close this
6801.36s:  and then I need to see if Mel put her order in. Yeah, isn't
6875.04s:  you.
6887.28s:  This is the main takeaway is for step three, which is what the fuck?
6896.80s:  The main takeaway from this exercise is step three. And what we're trying to do here is
6903.60s:  we want to have an exceedingly clear understanding of the stuff that we genuinely value.
6911.52s:  These are things that we're not capping ourselves. So for example, I know for a fact that
6921.60s:  sub-having true abundance, hundreds of billions of dollars, I genuinely don't want the yacht,
6930.40s:  I don't want the boat. And it's because as cool as that would be to share that with other people,
6937.28s:  and to let other people use that have fun with it, I don't think in general it would provide
6945.44s:  the overall utility that I could gain from other things. That's just my opinion.
6953.12s:  So what I do is I try to figure out the things that are worth the trade off.
6958.32s:  And if I can find things that are worth the trade off, meaning if I want to spend X number of
6965.84s:  dollars on this material thing that I care about, but it's going to make me work X percent longer,
6970.80s:  maybe that's it. But at the end of it, you should have very, very clear takeaway of the shit that
6979.28s:  you truly value trying to remove all of these different guards that get put up to reconcile where
6987.28s:  versus where we want to be. So also account for things that we might be judged by society,
6995.76s:  but putting that aside and focusing on what you care about. So like Rowan Titty is talking about
7002.16s:  building a sanctuary for groundhogs. Like how cool would that be?
7012.48s:  Titty says I just want to feed in house people. How cool is that?
7015.60s:  Right? Like both of those things are really, really cool to be able to do. And if you have true
7023.68s:  abundance, that's essentially how you get there. So that is my business pitch on the money mindset
7034.24s:  exercise. Why you should care about it? What you should do to get to the end of it. And then tomorrow,
7040.80s:  during the stream, we're going to go through an actual case study on how to work through the
7046.80s:  money mindset exercise and then to arrive specifically at what to do with it. Meaning how do we
7055.28s:  take the output from the money mindset exercise and then turn it into something that's actionable?
7061.60s:  How do we feed that information into our plan? That is the goal for tomorrow.
7069.92s:  So I hope this session is useful. I hope that the skill development ideas fun for you guys.
7075.28s:  It's really fun for me because I think spending a little bit of time getting really,
7079.76s:  really specific on some stuff to look at, I think is useful. So if there's stuff that we want
7086.08s:  to add to this list, if there's specific skills or specific ideas that you want to expand on,
7091.52s:  let me know. And we can absolutely build this out with other stuff that we want to spend if
7096.96s:  there's this specific skill that we want to grow. Lawrence's I prefer animals to people. I
7102.88s:  actually fully agree with that in general. I think a lot about, I think a lot about dogs and
7113.68s:  how incredible dogs are. It's like, it feels like we don't deserve them. They're just so good.
7119.84s:  They're always just happy to see you. And yeah, it feels like a lot. So let's grab
7131.68s:  where did we do this? Money mindset. So for those that are trying to find these videos,
7141.20s:  what I'm doing is adding a key here. So rather than using like dates and timestamps,
7151.12s:  I'm actually going to add the link to the video here so you can find it. And then as you know,
7158.48s:  what we're doing with the videos is I'm adding timestamps so that you can easily find the section.
7165.60s:  So the way to navigate this sheet is if there's a link there, this tells you what video to go to
7176.56s:  to find the information. And right now, you can access this on the website. So I'll show you where it is
7185.12s:  just in case you miss one or you want to go back and check one out. So we just go to resources,
7190.32s:  we go to the trading guide. And then oops, something went wrong. That's not good. We'll figure that
7196.88s:  out. But it's going to be added down here as a tab. So I'm just going to import it. So you'll be
7204.48s:  able to see it. So that's the game plan. Any other questions or anything else that you guys want to
7210.72s:  hit real quick before I wrap up and obviously fix whatever's up with that file. I don't have a
7218.48s:  annoying. All right, King, that wraps me up. If you guys need anything, hit me up in the discord.
7231.68s:  I'll see the pro members tomorrow on the stream. And then I'll see everybody on Friday for options
7236.56s:  trading basics for Friday. We have what is Friday, the 20 this one option pricing. So that is the
7246.24s:  game plan for Friday is we're going to review option pricing. Let me know if you need anything,
7250.96s:  be an outlier. I'll see you later.
