0.00s: What's up, outliers? Somebody sent this over asking, what is this new income generation
7.56s: GameStop ETF? So that's what we're going to take a look at. It's really nothing that
12.72s: complex, but as I promised, I will look and let's start here. What is this fund? Well,
22.08s: it's really simple. Funds like this exist already. If you take a look at something like
29.76s: JP Morgan, they have JEPI or JEPI, JEPQ. And these are different kind of funds where they
37.20s: typically will hold either a basket of stocks or a basket of synthetic long positions.
45.44s: And then those sell calls against it. The whole idea is to try to capture volatility so that
53.04s: you can hold the base position, but then also make some money in the near term against it.
58.88s: So this is just professional level, quote unquote, covered call trading of different capacity.
65.76s: So if we take a look at GameStop's version of this through IGME, there's a couple things that
73.44s: stick out to me. One of them, the nav is actually like really small still once you get into the
79.60s: actual assets. And it looks pretty new, but this I thought was actually quite interesting.
89.28s: Because right now, the way that they're doing this is actually through leverage.
96.00s: So you'll notice that there's actually no holding of the equity outright.
102.32s: I do find that curious. Now, a big reason why they're not is because it is cheaper to buy or in
112.72s: this case, they're actually creating these because if you notice 2301, you won't see that on the
118.96s: open market. So these are actually creations through a flex. So pull other process doesn't apply
126.24s: here, but what they're doing is gaining leverage. And I'll show you how I got my notepad.
131.92s: Let's take a look. So let's just use these for an example because these were long calls.
137.52s: We can figure out what the current value is. We don't know what they bought them for, but effectively
143.92s: they have 351 contracts. So this is the equivalent as always options. They deal in 100 lot instances.
153.84s: So really what they're holding is the equivalent of 35,100 shares. So if we were to buy those 35,100
163.68s: shares at the stock price of 23, it'll be way more expensive than what they got the same exposure for.
170.96s: Because these 351 contracts right now, they're worth $1.81. So if we do the math on this,
179.52s: and we figure out how much they might have paid outright for those 351 contracts. Again,
187.04s: we don't know what the original position was, but you can see the current market value there is
192.80s: $63,000. Then if we take 35,100 times 23.01, that would be 800 in $7,651. So this is the leverage
212.96s: that they're gaining. You notice how they're controlling the same size position, except they're
217.84s: using something around this amount of money. Again, we don't know what their actual entry was,
223.04s: whereas if they were to buy the shares, it would cost them this much. So this is very similar
228.64s: actually to my ratio called diagonal strategy. Now the difference is they are not trading it at a
233.84s: ratio. And the reason is because they're focusing on the income. So it's funny because when I saw
241.12s: this post originally, the poster was saying that it was kind of laughable or somebody to take
250.88s: hold game stop and give up the upside risk. But there's actually a really tactical reason why
256.96s: they're doing this. Now a couple of other questions people might have again are like, what are these
262.24s: paired with? So that's actually one of the reasons why sometimes you'll see these penny increments is
266.88s: it'll actually logically show you what it's paired with. And it'll mirror the O1 on the tail
275.04s: so that you can see what they're tying to what. Anyways, the other thing you'll notice is that
281.68s: there's actually short puts in here. This is really important because if they did not have
286.80s: these short puts, they would actually have upside risk, which I originally thought they had because
293.44s: that would be crazy. And I'll show you what the position looks like with this entire portfolio
298.24s: looks like. So if we get rid of that, we go over to the analyze tab. This is what their position looks
305.36s: like right now today. So I've included all of the individual legs that they have some of these down
314.24s: here are unchecked because there are existing stuff that don't apply here. This is the position.
319.60s: So what they're looking to do as you can tell is sacrifice the upside profit potential
328.00s: to take in all of the existing volatility. And for a lot of GameStop,
334.72s: ape, like true holdholders, this will seem crazy. But the reality is the frequency that we see
343.76s: squeezes is infrequent enough that you can make a lot of money doing something like this playing on
349.84s: the natural volatility and movement of GameStop compared to other stuff. Great example of this is
356.48s: if you take a look at the volume here, it's 73.56%. The implied volatility percentile, which ranks
363.68s: how high that is is literally at 4%. That means only 4% of instances have evolved that's lower than
373.36s: what we're seeing right now, which is crazy. It means that volatility on a relative level right
378.64s: now is super low. Yet it's still all the way up at 73.56. And this is a very liquid stock.
386.64s: For context, if we take a look at Pfizer, just throw a names out, their volume is 29.8%. Take a
393.20s: look at their implied volatility percentile, 50%. So it means half the time it's higher, half the time
398.08s: it's lower. Again, going back to GameStop, not even close. This is about as low as it goes.
404.24s: Then if we look at something like Apple, their vaults 29.8 imply volatility percentile 62%.
411.68s: Okay. Now you might be thinking, well, these aren't really volatile names. So what about something
416.16s: that's typically jacked to the tits like Tesla 68% vol. Their 68% vol has an implied volatility
424.32s: percentile of 54%, which means that this is pretty high. Whereas if we go back to GameStop,
429.76s: which still has a higher raw vault than everything else, but an insanely low imply volatility percentile,
438.24s: which again, means that volatility tends to be way higher still. So the reason why they're doing
445.04s: this is they're capturing the volatility richness of the stock itself. And I kind of poke through
452.96s: their filing documents to see, like I said, their fees are high for what this thing is. You're
458.08s: a point 98%. That's not like crazy for industry, but just higher. And actually that this confirms
464.80s: what I thought. It says it will invest in traditional exchange traded option contracts and
471.04s: flex exchange, which reflects options like I was referring to earlier using GameStop as a reference
476.08s: asset. This is a benefit of institutional levels. They can create things that fit their need.
482.56s: Now that doesn't a lot of people will jump at that and think like there's a lot of nefarious
489.60s: undertones going on here because I know that GameStop is riddled with that. And I'm not saying
494.80s: that is or isn't happening here. I don't know. But what I do know is this happens all the time.
499.20s: This is very, very common because again, there's a lot of regulation that applies to these kinds
503.92s: of assets compared to other stuff, especially when you're creating synthetic positions. You have
508.00s: to have clear pairings for the synthetic positions because otherwise your risk reward can really
513.20s: go out of whack super fast. A good example of this I'll show you. If we go back into what the fun
519.36s: looks like right now and let's get rid of the short puts that are at the very bottom. Notice what
526.88s: happens. They get smashed to the upside if they don't have these short put pairings in order to
534.16s: take up this risk. If we take off even the smaller one, notice how they eventually have upside
540.40s: risk. They don't want that. What they want is to have that capped upside to be able to take the
545.20s: premium in. So really, really common. This is not unique to GameStop. Again, Jepi, Jepq will use
551.44s: different kinds of versions of these very same things. Like if we go into Jepq and let's just take
558.64s: a quick look at what their holdings are. You'll notice it's a bunch of stock upfront, but if you click
565.60s: in, I fully expect to see some synthetics. So let's zoom in. Physical physical. So these are all
574.96s: regular stock and here you go. Equity, link, note, synthetic positions. And this is super common.
580.56s: This is how big institutions can use the money that they have to gain efficiencies.
587.76s: Now it does look like they're looking to cap their risk. So they don't want to have that upside
593.60s: risk, which is a really, really important note. I think upside risk in GameStop is suicide, especially
599.04s: at the institutional level that has a lot of various mandates. But it's an interesting thing. It is
604.80s: absolutely not anything I would ever even consider touching. It is easier to make these kinds of
611.20s: positions on your own much more cheaply, but nonetheless, it's an out of the box thing for again
618.48s: simplicity. So as always, if you have any questions, let me know. Be an outlier. See you guys later.
