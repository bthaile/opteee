307.00s: you
309.00s: observations
312.00s: in
313.00s: itself
319.00s: I have at least a pretty good understanding of what I'm looking to accomplish more broadly and what I want to do.
328.28s: But before we get into any of that, we do need to say hello to everybody that's here because you all are what make that a thing.
339.72s: And I want to explain to you why that's important in a minute.
343.96s: To that end, what's up, Lauren Kirk Schrey, Schreisen OG and same thing with IR2 Bad, another OG that's effectively been here from the start.
355.00s: I actually don't know for IR2 Bad. I'm not positive when you found your way into the
363.40s: channel. I know it's early. I just don't know exactly when. I'd love to know.
372.20s: Reggie says congrats, 40k will come soon. It'll come when it comes. One of the coolest things about the channel is that it consistently grows.
380.44s: So I fully agree for those that don't know the longer term objective is 100,000.
386.44s: And the reason why I want to get to 100,000, I've explained this before. But I think that that is main stream enough penetration for the YouTube channel.
397.88s: That it proves two things. One of them it proves that what I'm sharing is being shared in a way that at least is usable to a large number of people, which is important.
411.56s: But it also proves that I've done a good enough job striking that balance because, as you all know by now, I literally refuse to compromise on what I consider to be quite literally a moral obligation of a content creator, especially in this kind of space.
433.64s: Which is to not sell out, go down the route of here's how I made $62,000 over the weekend in three minutes, which is actually a real story.
444.52s: But I won't make that video. And the reason why I won't make that video is because that video will completely destroy a new trader's expectation of how this thing is going to go.
456.44s: And I think that sucks. It's effectively completely corrupting them and it's overall setting them up for failure or success, which is the antithesis of why I started this whole thing.
471.64s: Lawrence says we're going to have to get you to use clickbait titles and you could talk about paper trading. Yeah, now that is the old.
478.52s: What is it the rug pull fun fact for those that don't know the channel Benjamin, which is again, I hope you guys know I keep in touch with him pretty regularly actually I like Benjamin a lot.
491.24s: He's a really good dude. He's been getting more into trading, which is absolutely awesome to see.
499.00s: And this is this is his channel in case you don't know you should check it out and
507.16s: He's evolved a lot, but anyways, that idea of like a rug pull is definitely something he suggested. He was like, you have to just package them in a way that people will click and then you could talk about whatever you want.
521.40s: Which there's something to that, but I still have reservations about it a lot of it is I'm just a contrarian.
531.48s: I do like to do things differently than other people and my hope is that over time it'll do what it's supposed to do, which is find the people it's supposed to find.
543.80s: That is probably one of the absolute coolest things about our community genuinely is we literally have awesome people awesome people.
555.48s: If you think of online communities that talk about trading and talk about investing, it is very, very, very difficult to find places that people are willingly.
567.00s: Abel to help you have a conversation about something they're willing to structure it in an academically rigorous manner, which is asking questions probing looking for weakness, looking for strength.
582.36s: But then also just being a genuinely good person on the back end of it not being malicious, not just wanting to fight to bigger.
589.96s: That's the kind of stuff you're going to find on most online communities you'll find that on places like Reddit very frequently.
596.92s: I didn't find a lot of that we were on Facebook for those that don't know originally we moved from Facebook to discord and that's no small part due to another community mentor member Pita.
609.72s: And he's the entire reason why we migrated from Facebook to discord because I knew nothing about discord before him he's the one that built the shell that what we have is now completely predicated on now.
626.60s: I want to do two things.
629.00s: The phase says evening morning for me, we have a European in the group what's up good to see you from the other side of the pond.
638.28s: And then I are too bad says I think there was five on the discord. Okay so it was post migration can were you there when we were in Facebook still remind me.
647.96s: I remember it was early and I don't remember when we made the jump from Facebook to discord but it was early on the timeline there's well I don't remember most of the timeline.
659.08s: Okay no Facebook got it so it was still within the first year I think we made that migration if I'm not mistaken.
665.72s: Here's here's effectively how it went and I remember the date that I started the YouTube just because it's a funny day not because it's a meaningful day to me.
675.80s: I started the YouTube on 4 May and the reason why I think the reason why I remember the 4th of May which is that that's like Star Wars day right like me the 4th be with whatever the fuck.
692.44s: There's some Star Wars shit about this day if I'm not mistaken.
695.96s: So this I remember because of whatever that is and then over time we've made a couple big changes.
704.68s: The first one this was just YouTube then at some point it was a Facebook group then after the Facebook group we moved to discord.
715.48s: Then like literally a couple years later the Patreon hasn't been around that long Patreon came like maybe two years ago that's it thank you Reggie may the 4th be with you that's it.
726.84s: That's why I remember that date.
729.00s: And for those that don't know the origin story for the channel I want to tell you it because it's actually hilarious it's actually absolutely hilarious.
741.96s: We moved into this house right before COVID it's kind of during COVID it was in 2020 and we found that this house is on top of a hill.
753.80s: Why would like it but what I didn't know is bees honey bees when they have a nest at some point typically around the spring half of that nest leaves
768.44s: They break off and then they go create a new nest and then the old nest stays or doesn't that's a I don't know that part
775.32s: But I know that they break off in a bunch of them leave they literally fly around in
780.76s: In baskets of bees like it's huge I actually can probably find the video and see if I can't figure out how to show it to you guys because it's incredible
788.36s: I've never seen anything like this I'm from New York so seeing an absolute swarm of bees is
795.72s: Completely foreign to me
798.52s: This would have been back in like
801.08s: Definitely early on in 2020 before May of 2020 we know that and I'll explain why we know that in a second
808.68s: But it wasn't that far from there and
813.72s: So we I find out that my house has this really really fun quirk in order to address here it is
825.80s: Yeah, I'll figure out how to show it figure out how to show this to you guys
829.88s: maybe
831.88s: I'll fuck do I show this to you guys
834.84s: Can
837.00s: Does this come through it kind of does
840.92s: Kind of does well you'll be able to see as it moves give me a sec
845.08s: Oh wait I could just literally just put it on my fucking computer
849.00s: That was a boomer moment. I apologize for the boomer moment because I literally was about to just try to
855.88s: Fucking show I don't know why I was gonna do that was very silly
859.72s: I'm uploading it to Google Drive and then from Google Drive
863.40s: I will simply play the video on the computer and share the screen therefore you all can see beautifully
869.00s: This is actually the start by the way of the YouTube channel so the story about the bees is
876.04s: Comically important and I'm actually gonna see when that happened that was on the 20th of April
883.56s: That's actually even funnier than I thought
886.52s: All right, let me grab the video of the bees now that
892.12s: I've told you about them and I wouldn't want to leave you hanging
897.72s: I think it's cool literally because I I've never mine tire life
902.12s: seen anything like it
905.16s: Other people oh who knows other people it's probably like fucking part for the course not for your boy
913.16s: All right
915.64s: You
925.88s: This screen
929.00s: Beautiful beautiful beautiful
933.16s: All right, here we go
935.16s: So let me get rid of this this is outside my window
941.24s: And you can literally see outside my window
945.16s: this mess of
947.72s: Stuff these are all
950.76s: Bees and I'm gonna play it and you're gonna see them
954.36s: Flying around like that that was outside my window
957.48s: They were bouncing off the window and they were going inside this rain gutter right here
963.48s: They really liked that little rain gutter
965.64s: Thousands and thousands of them I had never seen anything like it
971.56s: So we I'm sitting in my office and then I realized that we're like in the apocalypse or the end of days
979.00s: In case anybody's allergic to bees that would not be the right place to be
983.16s: Get it and we call a like beekeeper to come get rid of the bees
989.56s: I don't have like a fucking bee suit and I'm not scared of bees, but I am also not fucking with
996.36s: And the way that I used to get rid of bees as a kid was using some sort of aerosol can and a fire source
1003.32s: Probably not sick on the house so the only real approved way that I know that like break cleaner
1009.08s: Wasn't gonna do it especially in that volume in case you didn't know bees
1013.16s: When they set up a hive they fucking somehow know where it is and they come back to it years later
1018.44s: Literally years later they've come back a couple times the way that we've kept them out is this really fine mesh
1024.60s: That we put in where they like to go the other hilarious part is that outside my window that you're just looking at
1032.28s: There's one corner right there that they were at there's another one over here same exact setup
1037.64s: They don't go to that one we don't have any mesh in that one they they never go on that one it's only that one
1043.72s: Nature's awesome
1045.72s: beekeeper comes and
1048.68s: We're just talking anybody that comes and works on the house or helps me at the house. I always
1054.76s: Express appreciation and I like learning so I was asking them all about the bees and just learning and
1061.80s: Right before he left he was heading out of the house
1065.88s: He literally goes to me and remember this is the 20th of April. He's like
1070.28s: Are you some sort of youtuber or something?
1073.40s: This is before I started the channel. I didn't even have social media
1077.72s: I thought that was the craziest fucking thing anybody ever could have said to me you guys see my face
1082.60s: I don't look pretty I don't belong in a camera
1085.64s: I thought it was the most absurd thing I literally was cackling laughing at that idea it was insane to me
1093.00s: and
1095.48s: What that was the 20th of April on the fourth of May
1099.40s: I started the youtube channel something I never thought of in any capacity in my entire life
1104.12s: Yet this fucking beekeeper was prescient
1106.68s: He somehow knew that that was gonna be a thing. I don't know how but clearly there was something there because
1113.48s: He planted the seed it's because of him were here. I think at least subconsciously
1120.20s: What prompted me to start the youtube channel was really really simple? I had a conversation actually today with one of my military friends
1127.80s: I didn't serve with him but I met him actually he helped me work on this house a little bit
1132.60s: And he reached out asking about game stop funny enough and he was asking about some position and management and stuff like that
1139.96s: I used to have a lot of those conversations
1142.92s: During COVID a lot of the bases said to their people unless there were some sort of very specific purpose for them to be there
1150.76s: They said like don't come in right we're trying to trampe tamped down the spread of this thing
1157.96s: So
1158.92s: bunch of friends are at home. I do what I do which is I
1164.36s: Got into investing because of the grace of a high school teacher a high school teacher took it upon himself
1172.76s: To introduce me to the concept of investing. I didn't ask him because I didn't know to ask
1179.56s: Yet
1180.52s: He still knew it was important and he shared it with me
1184.60s: I imagine this has got to be something like what religious people feel that go to like different people's houses trying to spread the religion
1191.32s: Generally, I feel like it's probably pretty close to that
1193.80s: Because I try to spread awareness about investing
1197.56s: During COVID friends are at home. I'm just calling my friends and I'm having very basic financial conversations
1205.32s: I know most people are not built for options. I know most people are not built for trading. It's not good for most people
1211.96s: I also know that I am on the spectrum and the stuff that I lock onto I have an obsessive personality that cannot let it go
1220.76s: If it's something I find interesting. I also know a lot of people are not like that
1225.64s: In these calls, I found myself repeating myself a lot
1230.44s: Basic concepts like do you have six months of an emergency expense
1236.04s: If you work in government or if you work in the military specifically six months is more than enough
1242.68s: If you work in a civilian job or something like a startup you want a little bit more than that because you never know when the ends to your income is gone
1251.72s: And for those that don't know one of the biggest mistakes you can make is by thinking that your
1259.40s: safe with your income if you think of you
1263.48s: And hopefully your eyes are a little more
1267.96s: Normally spread out than that if not you know chat out to you no disrespect
1272.36s: But if you have a W2
1275.56s: That is your income
1277.80s: That's literally your fucking lifeline that is the only source of capital you have to somebody like me
1285.32s: This is terrifying
1287.40s: Because you literally become a slave to this
1292.92s: They tell you to do something that you don't really want to do you got to do it
1297.96s: A lot of my friends were being told that they had to get the vaccine and a lot of them have different opinions
1303.64s: Again, not gonna go into whether you should get it not get it. I don't care at all
1307.72s: But in this context a lot of them were forced to either get in line and do it keep your job or if you don't do it
1316.04s: You lose your job
1317.80s: That is a big decision and when you only have one source of income
1323.16s: It forces your hand in a lot of cases because in case you don't know a lot of military families
1328.92s: The spouse doesn't work and it's because it's really fucking hard for them to work
1333.00s: They move every two to three years. That's hard to shit to get a job a lot of them
1337.88s: Thug it out and figure out how to get a job which is insanely impressive
1341.72s: But it's difficult for the spouse wherever that is
1346.04s: This is dangerous
1348.04s: during COVID
1350.04s: Understanding this structure. I I was over here on my phone
1355.40s: Calling my friends and saying like hey, are you investing and
1361.88s: Some of them say yes, some of them say I don't know how I was having the same conversations
1366.84s: I was saying do you have six months of
1369.80s: Savings expenses
1371.88s: This is your emergency fund. Do you have this and something liquid? No, okay, let's talk about a budget on how to do that
1379.72s: Once that's done, do you have some sort of investment portfolio set up outside of the TSP
1386.20s: Thrift savings plan. That's the OG retirement plan that is
1390.92s: Frankly awful
1392.20s: They've revamped it massively which I'm stoked for current military members on but when I was around it was awful
1399.32s: With that most of the time it's no they don't even know what a broker is
1406.44s: So then it's walking them through finding a broker then after finding a broker
1411.64s: It's how to build a buy and hold portfolio that outperforms the market
1417.32s: Walking them through that these are
1420.84s: Basic topics that I was repeating that I literally could easily make a video
1426.76s: Hey say hey watch these four videos and then let's hop on the phone and let's talk about your individual scenario on like what makes sense out of all of this
1436.84s: This is how it all started that's why I started the YouTube in May
1440.60s: Happened to be the fourth which is funny happened to be after the 20th of April where that beekeeper mentioned the idea of a YouTube
1446.92s: Which I thought was ridiculous and I
1450.60s: Obviously to subconscious plant in my mind and I started it and I did not start it with any
1455.88s: Context or any idea of
1458.68s: Growing it or becoming a content creator or a financial influencer like none of that bullshit
1465.00s: I still don't identify with literally any of that
1468.52s: This is how it started and then I found some of my early videos
1475.16s: Started gaining traction and I actually found the oldest video that I could find on the channel to share with you guys because it's actually kind of funny
1482.92s: I thought we could look at it together
1485.16s: One thing to note this is not the first video on the channel. I went through a phase
1491.48s: Where I actually deleted a ton of videos hundreds of videos off the channel
1497.40s: I had no idea that that hurt the channel in case you don't know it does and here's how it hurts the channel and it's why I don't do it anymore
1505.56s: Is if you have a bunch of different videos and
1510.52s: Let's say you got 10 views 10 views 10 views 10 views 10 views you have 50 views and then let's say that you delete these three
1519.56s: You lose 30 views now you have 20 views
1523.32s: So it actually hurts the channel stats overall the views aren't attached to the channel
1529.12s: They're attached to the video. I didn't know that so I literally deleted hundreds of videos
1533.48s: The reason why I deleted hundreds of videos is I'm actually really really big into organization
1537.96s: I like things to be streamlined. I don't like a bunch of fluff access
1542.60s: I like stuff to be extremely streamlined and
1547.80s: Having like the mess of a bunch of videos that are just unlisted was annoying to me
1552.84s: So I just deleted a bunch again don't do that anymore
1555.80s: So this is the oldest that I could find this is from the 20th of May
1562.28s: which
1564.92s: Yeah, okay that makes sense because I was gonna say the data the video is the 22nd which that doesn't make sense to me
1572.04s: Let me
1573.56s: There like some fucking inception thing that I thought that it was oh is the 22nd of me, okay. Yeah, I just had the date wrong
1582.12s: So this video was uploaded on the 22nd of May
1585.72s: which is when this is up here
1589.48s: This video was about the VIX V compared to Vxx
1596.36s: The funny thing about the video as I look at it is I
1602.24s: can see how
1604.24s: unbelievably awful this is to watch and
1609.16s: I look at it now and I literally am like
1612.68s: This is terrible
1615.24s: I've learned so much
1618.60s: From this starting point to where we are now and
1623.56s: All of it is completely self-taught. It's like the trading skill set. This is me
1629.00s: Going through a learning phase and learning something completely new
1634.60s: Even though still at this point I had no real aspirations of like growing the channel
1640.20s: Actually, I could tell you right now. I think I can tell you right now how many subs I had at the time at a sheer curiosity
1646.52s: Let's see let's see if I can figure that out
1650.84s: I'm almost positive
1653.40s: I'll be able to
1656.12s: Identify is that would actually be kind of fucking hilarious
1661.32s: But the fuck this is views I'm not used
1671.96s: Monthly audience yeah, this is fine
1675.08s: So this is not subscribers is just like the month the number of monthly people that view
1680.92s: The channel and for context right now. It's like 70,000 to a hundred thousand
1686.76s: Over the course of a month still by no means any sort of like significant footprint at all
1692.68s: So what I'm doing is now I'm moving the chart out. It's actually hilarious. Let's find
1699.80s: May 20th
1701.80s: May 20th
1703.40s: was 452
1708.04s: Or hundred and 52 monthly viewers
1713.56s: Right on and then the average for like 2020 into 21 was like 4,000 over the course of a month
1720.04s: so
1721.56s: Pretty good pretty good growth there overall
1726.04s: Let's listen to a little bit of Vxx
1730.60s: Vx just because it's awful it really is so bad and I think it's funny to
1736.84s: laugh at me. I listen to everything two times I'll slow it down to normal which is gonna be even more painful for me
1743.24s: And
1744.52s: Let's just listen to a few seconds of this before I get completely over it you can also see my hair
1749.56s: Was wild I hadn't had a haircut in a while and it's again because
1755.64s: COVID right all the barber shops are closed so
1759.40s: You boy was just growing out growing out the hair
1763.88s: The view here is very different the view here is so different because this was all done on a laptop
1770.92s: I didn't even have a desktop I didn't have a webcam all of it like the laptop used to be over on that side
1779.48s: And I also didn't have a mic somebody bought me my first mic
1784.04s: Which was hilarious I did not have a mic and
1789.48s: I had absolutely no real game plan for the videos kind of similar to now for being honest about it
1797.08s: But because you I like I did the same thing which is just kind of
1801.72s: Outline stuff
1803.72s: But let's listen
1806.28s: Hey everybody
1807.24s: As promised I have another video
1809.48s: Comparing the VIX to the VXX
1812.84s: V also these awesome their products that I really enjoy their video. It's awful. That's fucking awful
1822.44s: Like now
1824.84s: Knowing what I know now the first 10 seconds of a video are so important and
1831.88s: What I've said so far in the first 10 seconds of this video is
1836.92s: Abs of fucking literally nothing I've said nothing in the first 10 seconds just nothing
1843.56s: It's what it just words
1846.36s: Let's see when I actually say something of substance
1849.56s: Very nuanced I'm actually there new wants that's what you get your 12 seconds in
1857.00s: And your biggest takeaway is that volatility ETS ETPs are nuanced
1864.44s: Sick right what a fucking revelation
1869.24s: Talking with one of my friends right now who's been a lot of time
1873.64s: Learning about volatility so I'm hoping to have him come on and talk to us a little bit
1878.20s: About what he's learned bring some of his experience to the table as well because I absolutely respect his opinion on
1884.60s: Now I'm talking to you in a video
1887.56s: Where 27 seconds in and I haven't said shit about the difference between these
1893.48s: I'm talking about a fucking friend and their experience with VX
1898.68s: I was actually trying to figure out who this friend might have been I don't remember who it was
1904.60s: But
1906.12s: That's what you get so far from a well this used to be E.S. Invests
1911.08s: So fuck that guy fuck E is invests the E is invests
1915.40s: Starting point is you sit in a video for 30 seconds and you have fucking nothing to show for it other than these things are weird
1924.52s: I'm messed up but to kind of prep us for that conversation and settle up on a couple you know basic
1932.44s: I don't know
1933.24s: Simulate some no shortage of um's I think that's what like four
1938.52s: Or ohms already 37 seconds in
1942.36s: Nailed that we're averaging in um every 10 seconds love that for me
1948.52s: Malarity is in difference between the two I figured this would get places start so first we have the VX
1955.72s: 44 seconds in
1958.44s: We now start the video
1961.40s: That's what this is 44 seconds in we now start the fucking video and then the VX
1968.52s: They are different they are similar but they are different let's start
1975.56s: Case you didn't know they're different I've I've really felt the need to elaborate that they're different in case the
1983.32s: entire different ticker structure didn't allude to the fact that they're different
1989.48s: Now you know they're different art with the similarities and then I'll branch into the differences
1994.36s: So both of them have options available to trade on them
1999.00s: Not gonna lie the rest of it is reasonable I think because from here I effectively just go through this and as usual
2008.92s: I'm extremely confident in the knowledge I had at this point even though it's five years ago
2014.12s: I've learned a lot over the last five years in insane amount
2018.28s: but
2019.56s: I still know like the general information that I was sharing was fine
2025.00s: But take a look at that delivery now again. I'm not saying that I got it figured out I just released a video today on Vega
2032.28s: It's kind of an off-cycle release because I'm trying to get the the Greek simplified out in case you guys haven't seen it
2039.40s: This one this video here is about Vega actually let's I'm literally gonna pull it up really quick
2045.96s: So that we could do a side by side and see what this how this one goes let's go up
2051.56s: Genuinely curious
2054.12s: All right, let's see let's see how this one goes so we're
2058.44s: We're just starting outliers today. We're gonna talk about how this can destroy your options trades continuing
2066.36s: with the option Greeks simplified series today. We're looking at Vega at the
2073.40s: 13 seconds in you know what the video is about you know that there's this quirky little thing that can fuck up your returns
2081.72s: In the video you will have an understanding a reminder of what Vega is but more importantly how to practically apply it to your trading
2090.20s: and you know what you get at the end of the video
2098.20s: Oh my god, it's so bad
2100.92s: It's hilarious as you could tell I can laugh at it because I totally understand the context of war
2107.00s: I was at here and what I was doing so I'm not embarrassed by it at all this is still live on the channel
2113.08s: I haven't even taken it down because the information's fine
2116.36s: I do have a note to redo this video though after I looked at it because I was like it's about time for an update
2122.20s: But not embarrassed by it at all. It's in context I understand it entirely
2127.72s: lot has changed and
2130.60s: That's really fun for me. I haven't had the opportunity to learn something new in a long time like a genuinely new skill set
2140.36s: This is the first
2142.36s: Completely foreign skill set that I've learned in a very long time and it's entirely foreign
2149.56s: It's social media. It's brand management. It's content creation. It's presentation style. It's everything
2157.72s: And I really enjoy not just the process of sharing information but learning a new skill
2164.28s: That's why when I look at where we're at so far year to date
2169.88s: even though
2171.64s: Where you know 15% off of where I wanted to be at the end of the year
2178.36s: This is completely fine
2180.60s: This is completely fine progress and it's because more than the top line number here
2187.72s: What I care about just like in trading is the process. Am I learning how to do this better?
2193.64s: Am I learning how to convey information about something as boring as Vega?
2201.32s: Am I able to convey that at least in a marginally reasonable way that people will find useful at the very least?
2210.20s: The next evolution realistically is to figure out how to make those things like
2217.16s: genuinely interesting to people that's kind of hard and that's a not I haven't really been able to crack that successfully yet
2225.88s: and it's because
2228.44s: Once you start getting into any of the no-manclature of options
2233.48s: you immediately remove
2236.44s: 95% of traders have no fucking idea what any of it means that's even more at the surface level of
2243.00s: talking about delta
2245.08s: That's why when I look at my long-term goal of 100,000
2250.84s: I think that's aggressive as is
2253.96s: But there's also a very small number of YouTube channels that hit that and that's
2260.68s: Outlier performance. It doesn't matter what I do my mind is geared to try and hit outlier performance. So if I ask how many channels
2273.00s: How many YouTube channels hit 100,000
2279.72s: Subscribers
2283.00s: And let's see as a percentage and we need to
2291.48s: As a percentage of
2295.08s: Content creation channels because it's not just of all accounts that doesn't matter
2300.04s: All right, so it looks like
2306.92s: There's a
2314.76s: So it looks like there's an average of 34 million
2318.12s: YouTube channels and that there's 24,000 with over a hundred thousand
2325.16s: So it's about a zero point zero seven percent chance but again
2330.52s: Just like this stats in trading
2333.56s: I don't really take that as zero point zero seven percent because I know for a fact a good number of
2342.12s: YouTubers that start just like a good number of traders that start are gonna wash out immediately
2346.84s: Either lazy they're not gonna do the fucking work and I don't identify with that at all
2351.08s: I identify with the group that
2353.56s: What's the refered in and then they still fail that's the group that I would want to compare myself against and I don't really believe that's in store for me or
2364.36s: The account my genuine
2367.48s: My genuine expectation is that it will continue to slowly and steadily grow
2375.08s: If I share with you and by the way if you have any questions about the YouTube channel literally anything
2381.16s: Ask me if you're curious how much it makes if you're curious about watch hours watch time anything ask me
2386.76s: It's all completely on the docket all of it is open source. I am not I don't hide anything about it
2396.12s: But if I look at quickly subscribers
2400.52s: and
2402.52s: I look at specific years
2404.52s: so in
2406.52s: 2024
2408.52s: I
2412.52s: Let's go to let's go back and let's do
2415.00s: 2020
2419.00s: and
2421.00s: Let's see what I grew in 2020
2423.16s: I
2426.92s: Have to start it at may force it's yelling at me so may force
2432.12s: 20
2438.04s: The channel grew by 28,000
2441.88s: subs
2444.28s: That was
2446.12s: funny enough a company by a time a ton of
2451.96s: accounts that latched on to small parts of what I did but not like the options trading stuff
2461.56s: So that's why that year oh no that's to 2024. I was wondering I was like that seems a little off
2468.12s: Let's see in 2020. There we go
2470.76s: So in 2020 like it was 4,000 4.4,000
2475.16s: That's how much the channel grew in 2020
2483.40s: in 2021
2489.40s: We grew by
2492.12s: 20,000
2503.08s: Very quirky this
2504.12s: Cool
2507.40s: 2021
2511.56s: Was
2513.56s: It this tool is
2515.56s: Fucking killing me
2518.12s: It just did uh January there we go
2522.04s: All right, I got it now
2530.92s: There we go
2533.08s: Okay in 2021 was 1.8,000 so
2538.76s: Jackitively very very slow in 2022
2551.48s: It was
2565.00s: Let's see
2568.36s: 3,000
2572.28s: 2023
2582.28s: It was
2586.84s: So 4,000 1,000 3,000 that one 6,000
2592.44s: Next was 12.6,000
2595.64s: And 2025 so far is 7,000
2599.72s: So a little bit slow compared to last year
2604.20s: But I think one of the biggest things that I felt really comfortable with is
2610.76s: Who is finding their way into the community?
2613.88s: It's the same thing in like the discord what I care more about than anything
2618.84s: Without a doubt is the quality of the community and not the quantity
2625.24s: All right, let's see
2628.68s: Lauren says you taught someone who didn't understand a bit as spread a ton in just over a year
2634.52s: The first six months I didn't understand 90% of what was happening
2637.72s: Lauren honestly I'm very very glad that you found the community just because not only you're super engaged and I value you being part of it
2644.76s: But you are the kind of person that I am trying to reach at this point
2650.68s: What you're the people that are trying to learn
2653.48s: willing to put in the work in effort but
2657.48s: are
2659.08s: susceptible to going down the wrong path and my overall goal is to try to divert people from the wrong path
2667.08s: I'm super stoked
2669.08s: Trade questions also fair game absolutely any trading questions feel free to throw them out without a doubt
2675.08s: Kirk says what is the most profitable single video let's find out
2681.00s: I have absolutely no idea
2685.32s: Give me second I'll try to figure out honestly don't really know how to fucking find that but
2690.12s: I
2692.52s: Think I could figure it out okay here we go here we go here we go here we go so these are videos
2697.96s: The uh let me go to lifetime
2701.32s: the single
2703.32s: best performing video
2707.24s: Or the most profitable single video is master zero dt options
2713.80s: that video
2716.60s: Oh grab it really quick in case you guys haven't seen it
2720.76s: Is this video
2723.32s: and that video has
2725.56s: 55,900 views
2729.08s: and the revenue for that video is 787 dollars
2735.00s: So 55 it's really 56,000 this is 55,911 views
2740.76s: So and this one brought in 787 lifetime revenue
2745.80s: This video I don't know
2749.40s: It was posted in 2023 may of 2023 so it's been about two years
2757.64s: That is what that one's been
2762.76s: Jordan says top three countries that watched the channel
2766.76s: the top three countries are probably what you would expect
2772.04s: The top three for sure are US Canada and then I don't know the third I'll tell you right now
2779.48s: I'll take a guess because I think it's kind of fun
2782.36s: Where would I guess
2787.16s: I'm between like South America and Europe is a cheat because there's a lot of countries in Europe
2792.52s: So I'd have to be specific
2794.84s: I would guess Germany I would guess well South America is in a fucking country either
2799.48s: It's a continent where in South America Brazil because just norm like larger population
2806.36s: And then for Europe I'm guessing Spain or Germany
2812.76s: I'm gonna guess Germany Germany
2815.72s: All right, let's see let's see what you guys are from
2820.52s: Fuck
2822.84s: Germany's number five so not that far off
2825.96s: So the top geographies top five United States is 58 percent
2832.52s: Canada is 7 percent Australia
2835.80s: Bit of a curve ball 3.3 percent I guess I should have stuck with English speaking countries that was a bit of a rookie mistake
2843.00s: Australia
2844.60s: 3.3 percent United Kingdom 3 percent and then Germany 2.2 percent
2850.60s: Per capita Germany being there is actually quite high
2854.20s: Then it's India Japan Singapore Netherlands Spain Sweden Switzerland Italy Polent Island France Norway is real UAE Brazil
2863.40s: Brazil was way off Malaysia Belgium Hong Kong New Zealand South Korea Ireland Romania South Africa Austria Denmark Portugal
2871.96s: Mexico Greece Taiwan Checcia that's fascinating Turkey Bulgaria Philippine Finland
2879.08s: Vietnam Argentina Cyprus Saudi Arabia Columbia Indonesia Hungary Croatia Slovenia Puerto Rico and Pakistan
2889.08s: That is the rundown
2895.16s: The next is what is the average age
2899.32s: average age
2901.32s: Doesn't give me average age it gives me a breakdown in terms of buckets
2906.20s: And it looks like the average age is something between 35 and 54 both of those are 25 percent of the channel
2913.24s: respectively that's for the last 28 days
2916.52s: There's 0 percent 13 to 17 and then one and a half percent 18 to 24 25 to 34 is 12.6 percent
2925.32s: 55 to 64 is 20.2 percent 65 plus is 15.3 percent
2930.28s: It's about what I would expect honestly the 25 to 34 is a little bit light that makes me a little bit sad
2935.88s: I would like to penetrate that age group more deeply just because
2941.16s: That's the group that really can stand to learn a lot here the 18 to 24 that would be ideal
2948.36s: But I also am realistic and I know that the majority of like 18 to 24 is not happening
2954.04s: So yeah, male the female ratio male the female ratio. Funny. What would you guys guess?
2961.48s: What is
2964.60s: What's the guess?
2967.16s: Or
2968.84s: Male the female ratio. What do you guys think?
2973.40s: 90 percent males with Jordan says
2977.40s: Kirk 90 10
2981.08s: Any others?
2984.60s: Lawrence is 5 percent female. Buck in a learn you're exactly correct.
2990.20s: It's 5.4 percent female and 94.6 male
2999.88s: I
3001.24s: Honestly don't know why that is
3005.48s: Because I feel like trading is accessible to anybody so I don't know why maybe it's like the channel
3011.40s: Just the way that I am and maybe other channels are way more female dance that absolutely could be
3017.48s: But I wonder if it's more of a
3021.48s: I wonder if it's more of a niche thing
3027.24s: Ken says I've heard the ladies turn out to be better traders. I could see that
3031.80s: I also think that's one of those things that's like said and I don't know if it's actually true
3036.84s: But I could absolutely see that I've worked with quite a few women especially in like the coaching program and
3043.56s: They're really good at the like they're super coachable again to
3049.16s: Generalize broadly, but they're they're super coachable which is great
3053.72s: You can make a lot of progress there and I think that that's a good general trait
3058.28s: But I also think
3059.96s: One of the common themes I see is a little bit gun shy
3063.80s: So that's probably just because they're thinking through stuff a little more pragmatically and
3070.68s: Like accepting of risk and thinking of risk. I'm just guessing in broad generalizations
3075.64s: I think that that typically would hold up though between like general male disposition versus female
3082.20s: But yeah, I could definitely see the the potential for them to be insanely good traders
3087.88s: Zubers says found this channel when I saw roaring kiddies meme options 101
3094.04s: I'm actually really really stoked that that's how you found the channel is because when I let me find my first GME video
3102.60s: When was that I've been doing GME videos for a while, but let's find the first one here
3108.52s: the first one looks like June
3111.56s: of
3113.56s: 24
3116.92s: So this looks like this looks like the video
3125.00s: And this was in June so this is talking about roaring roaring kiddies position
3133.80s: and
3135.80s: It's explaining the difference between
3139.96s: Value noional value in terms of how much the options were
3144.44s: Ah, this was a big thing I remember because I remember somebody was asking me about the idea of like what what's
3151.24s: you gonna do with his positions? What are the choices and a lot of people a lot of people thought that he was gonna exercise
3160.28s: and I think the reality is my argument is that he wouldn't have done that
3167.24s: and I don't know if I included the math here somewhere
3173.64s: I don't see it
3174.92s: There he is I don't think I included the the math here but
3180.92s: the he would have given up an insane amount of intrinsic value which wouldn't have made sense
3188.52s: So yeah, I'm actually really really stoked that you came across the channel in this way
3193.88s: Brain says Eric what is that short handed crescent wrench looking plaque thingy hanging on your wall?
3203.88s: What I don't I don't see it what thing are you referring to?
3219.32s: I think this was brain I don't see the
3224.76s: I don't see the thing I
3227.40s: See the mammoth tusk that's actually super cool in case you didn't know that's a real mammoth tusk
3233.56s: from Russia that's a megalodon tooth this is a piece of a meteor
3240.12s: This is a walrus tusk from Alaska
3244.20s: That's an arrowhead that I found from New York and then that's a dinosaur tooth the real dinosaur tooth
3250.36s: I forgot the name of the dinosaur but that one is also sick and then over here
3257.64s: I have a laquis ashi
3260.84s: Katana it's like a short katana that was actually sent to me from a viewer I cherish that that is of
3268.68s: Old Viking so knife S E A X kind of like their basic knife and then there's like some neclices like Viking neclices that are on that
3278.92s: Then this little clear thing
3281.32s: Which is hard to see is actually a piece of bar wire from D day. I'll show it to you
3286.84s: That thing is really really cool
3295.56s: Oh you mean nothing
3299.08s: That thing
3301.08s: So is a piece of bar wire from Omaha Beach on D day that they put in like these acrylic containers
3316.84s: It's like super cool
3322.68s: This is a knife that my grandpa made out of a file so if you see the bottom here
3331.88s: It's not focusing if you see the bottom here. This is actually the bottom of a file and
3338.68s: Yeah, he made this out of a file so obviously I love that
3347.16s: And
3349.16s: That's a hop light helmet as you might guess
3353.16s: That's a saver tooth cat skull from the braia tar pits
3357.80s: And then these are plaques that I've gotten those two are plaques that I've gotten from
3363.88s: Prior prior gigs that I had I got that one when I was a platoon commander and then I got this one when I was a platoon commander is well
3373.40s: And then I have a couple others over there from when I was like an opso and then those two are my like rank
3383.32s: Rank paperwork so when you when you get promoted in the Marine Corps you go through like a
3391.40s: Commissioning process you have to recommission and renew your command
3394.68s: But definitely the coolest thing there is that fucking mammoth test that things like 40 thousand years old
3400.92s: From an actual mammoth which is I think absolutely sick
3406.20s: Then it's mostly was in the background. Oh, yeah my mother and law painted that she painted that by hand
3411.80s: That's of my actual Corvette and it's like it's exactly
3415.88s: It's exactly how it looks well how it used to look it has a slightly different paint scheme now similar
3421.72s: But different I have a driver stripe oh and
3425.24s: One of the coolest details that she captured in here is I have what's called an engage
3431.40s: Actually in like this part so like the driver side corner
3436.04s: That's where I get all data for the car because it's all tuned and stuff and she literally got like even got that in there
3442.28s: Which is cool and then
3444.76s: This one is just a painting a really famous painting I remember it from TBS of the Marines at Bello Wood
3452.76s: The reason why I like that painting a lot is that it reminds me about like the nature of humans and that of war
3461.88s: The reality is humans have like this veneer of civilized behavior
3467.72s: We use forks to eat and we talk a certain way
3472.92s: But these motherfuckers were fighting and mustard gas
3476.28s: Staving each other with bayonets and trying to rip each other's masks off to kill them
3481.96s: that I
3484.84s: Think carries a lot of weight and it's also a reminder to me of how obnoxiously good I have it
3494.76s: and that we stand on the shoulders of giants of people that have done
3501.80s: extremely hard things and
3506.36s: That is a
3509.16s: constant reminder to me that I am unbelievably fortunate that I
3515.40s: Never had a fight in fucking mustard gas where dudes are using bayonets to kill each other like that's intense
3523.08s: Never had anything like that
3529.88s: Goofy says I enjoy watching your channel your smart and have some good perspectives
3535.08s: I appreciate that the main thing I try to bring with at least the perspectives is I try to very clearly
3542.12s: Delineate what's in opinion of mine versus like just a factual piece of information
3548.28s: I think people should be provided data and then I think you guys
3555.64s: Should be empowered to come to your own conclusions or to ask your own clarifying questions
3562.04s: Sometimes obviously I'll share my opinion if I think it's warranted
3566.12s: But more often than not I really try to focus on the objective sharing of data
3573.64s: And then either helping you guys learn how to make your own decisions or frame decisions stuff like that so that's I'm stoked on that
3583.00s: Glent area and says how are your accounts featured marked to market just ignore PDT yet? That's exactly right
3590.52s: So I have a bunch of different accounts right so I have retirement accounts. I have different entity accounts and
3598.20s: Most of like the more professional trading accounts those are built marked to market
3603.56s: They get rid of like wash sale rules and stuff like that and
3608.28s: The other accounts are just standard so like the retirement account I have a
3614.60s: Roth IRA for that so that kind of thing I still trade it but I trade it within the bounds
3620.84s: That you have to treat Roth IRAs with which is not as bad as people think by the way and it's also
3628.60s: Not is difficult to put money in there is people think that's another thing
3632.04s: I think that's really broadly misunderstood about Roth IRAs
3636.20s: You get priced out of being able to directly contribute to them fast
3640.92s: So I don't know what the income limit is I'll take you guys right now
3647.08s: What are the current single and married income limits
3655.64s: to contribute
3659.48s: Do a Roth IRA in the US? I think it's only in the you but there's Roth IRAs
3666.68s: I think that was
3669.64s: An unnecessary dot of point
3673.56s: Let's see
3679.24s: So single you have to make less than 150k if you're married it's 236
3687.72s: then there's a reduced contribution
3691.40s: which is 150 to 165 for single and 236 to 246 for married
3698.04s: And then there's no contribution which is 165 or more or 246 or more which
3705.96s: That still is absolutely confounding to me because if they're trying to incentivize saving like why is that even
3713.16s: penalized in that way it's super annoying but in case you don't know
3718.28s: You can still contribute it's just not in a tax
3723.56s: Advantage way so what you can do is you can contribute to a traditional IRA not
3730.44s: tax not not tax deductible and then you can convert
3736.44s: that
3737.48s: Traditional into a Roth and
3740.12s: As long as you do it quickly enough so that there's no gains then there's no
3744.84s: There's no penalty there there's no nothing but
3748.68s: That's the easiest way
3750.76s: to
3751.80s: Still fund a Roth IRA and the reason why funding a Roth IRA is important at least for or like outliers for people like me
3761.16s: is
3763.16s: Compared to the normal person the normal person
3768.44s: They're going to their income should look like this
3774.76s: If you start off you really have no income
3777.40s: Let's say that this is like 18 let's say that this is like 40 and then let's say that this is like 60
3783.16s: Most people it looks like this
3785.48s: Where you're in like the meat of your earnings potential in here
3790.52s: And then at the end for most people they don't have a W2 once they retire
3796.76s: So then their income is typically just like social security
3801.00s: But for somebody like
3804.60s: Me and hopefully other folks the way it works is
3809.96s: the way that I've built stuff is my income goes like this
3817.64s: And I by the time I'm 60 which is what like 25 years from now 26 years from now
3825.64s: My income will be parabolic up from where it is now like parabolic up
3831.24s: So a Roth is useful to me because it's tax deferred on withdrawals once you're at 59 and a half plus
3842.52s: That's why if you do not think that you're going to be
3846.44s: Experiencing higher income later than a traditional IRA is completely reasonable because it's tax deferred up front
3853.00s: And then you pay taxes when you take it out but if you're building good robust income sources
3857.88s: So that you're not the normal person and the normal person has one income source
3866.52s: That one income is typically a W2 if you're enterprising you'll have a W2 you'll have a couple side hustles you'll have trading
3879.08s: You'll have real estate
3881.88s: Probably hopefully a few of those
3884.84s: And maybe you start a side business
3889.80s: This is the idea of
3892.44s: Really diversifying your income sources and trying to increase your robustness
3898.28s: Because what this means is like if this doesn't work that's okay you still have these other things if this doesn't work you still have all these other things
3906.28s: And it creates a much more
3909.00s: Robust profile for yourself
3911.24s: It's not gonna happen immediately. It's unrealistic to expect that kind of thing immediately
3915.72s: But it is absolutely something that's attainable
3921.56s: Any other
3922.76s: Questions that you guys have it can be about the channel it can be about the community can be about the future
3928.68s: It can be about trading whatever you guys want
3931.48s: And Kirk says do you mega back door your Roth? Yeah, that's exactly right so right now
3935.72s: It's still completely fine to do that. It's not illegal. It sounds more nefarious than it actually is
3941.40s: But you absolutely can continue to fund your Roth in a couple different ways
3950.20s: Yeah
3951.40s: It's again if you're if you're expecting to have more robust income
3956.20s: Then it definitely is worth it
3960.68s: In the meantime, I do want to talk a little bit about the future
3964.92s: Because I spent a lot of time thinking about the community and trying to figure out like
3972.12s: What I think would be good for us where I want to go and I think
3981.32s: The most important thing to me is
3984.52s: To continue adding value that's very very important to me
3990.36s: I find what I do here somebody somebody asked a while ago like
3995.72s: Well, it's not asked it's more of accused me somebody accused me of making like tons of money on on
4002.44s: YouTube and like the lifetime revenue for the channel is not that much
4007.16s: If I look at how much I've made over the lifetime of
4014.04s: The channel
4015.80s: Against the amount of time that I put in just to build content not even the amount of time to generate the experience
4024.28s: In order to build the content I literally am making like $4 an hour if that
4030.20s: So
4031.40s: There's a big massive myth that if you have some sort of YouTube channel you immediately have like tons and tons of money
4037.80s: Objectively not true. I
4040.44s: Spend on a weekly basis. Let's say that I do one video which is like my Sunday video that one video
4051.08s: Normally recorded let's say on average is 15 minutes and
4056.12s: Let's say to build it is like 60 minutes
4060.52s: That the reason for the duration to build it is because I do need to typically create some materials for it
4068.84s: And then I try to think of like a talk track for it. So there's 75 minutes
4074.44s: Then from a live stream lens
4077.80s: We have the Sunday stream which is typically 60 minutes
4082.68s: We have the Tuesday stream which is typically 60 minutes
4088.20s: Then we have the Wednesday stream which is 60 minutes then we have the Thursday stream
4096.04s: Which is 60 minutes Friday which is generally longer
4102.76s: More like 90 minutes on average maybe
4106.92s: Then we have the Saturday stream which is typically a little more than 60 minutes maybe 70 minutes ish
4114.52s: If I add this all up
4118.04s: on
4120.04s: a
4121.88s: weekly basis we're at 475 minutes
4128.28s: This is of just content of just content creation which is seven hours well eight hours
4137.08s: The amount of time to build the material for these is also not insignificant
4143.56s: So for the Sunday video it's typically not a ton of prep maybe like 30 minutes 40 minutes
4149.48s: The Tuesday is not a lot of prep maybe same 30 40 minutes
4153.40s: The Wednesday video typically more prep Thursday video definitely more prep Friday video
4158.52s: Definitely more prep and then the Saturday video less prep
4162.44s: The prep for these for all of these especially like the Wednesday Thursday Friday
4169.72s: is way more than what it takes to actually do the video
4176.44s: The funny thing here is that as I do the math
4181.00s: On the total number of videos I have and the total video hours that are produced and the time that it takes to put the videos in and together
4189.88s: It's literally like $5 an hour which is I couldn't care less. I really am not doing this for that
4195.96s: So that that's the beautiful part about being financially free is that I can spend the time
4202.84s: To do something that has an absolutely tremendously negative ROI, but I believe in it
4208.68s: The reason for the patreon is
4212.60s: Literally to help subsidize the cost for me doing things
4217.80s: So it costs money for me to host a website it costs money for me to hire people
4222.36s: Which is a big thing that's one of my big projects for
4225.16s: 2026 is I want to hire more headcount for the community and it's not like hiring for the sake of hiring or even
4233.08s: Hiring necessarily to grow the channel per se. I do want to grow the channel, but
4237.40s: It's actually hiring to just fucking provide jobs and to allow people some sort of part-time side hustle
4245.88s: On a topic that they like right now the people that help make YouTube shorts
4250.36s: I just kicked those back off there a community member heard somebody that's helping me come up with like
4256.12s: background materials FAQs there's a
4260.92s: Greeks base
4263.32s: Like word game that's gonna be in the newsletter like a community member is doing those and
4270.60s: Those kind of tasks are things before that like there is no budget at all to pay any of these people
4276.52s: Which I wanted to try to find a way to pay them because like these are younger dudes
4281.24s: They're in there early 20s. I think one of the person that works for me is still in their teens and it's like I want to try to give them
4289.16s: some money and
4291.16s: to make it make sense
4293.56s: so
4294.76s: The thing I do with the patreon is reinvest the overwhelming majority of it
4299.64s: The other thing that I try to do is price the patreon so that it's reasonable
4304.44s: But that the value so far exceeds the cost that I think it's like
4313.24s: 5 to 6 times value per cost at least and that's the only way that I can structure something like that and feel good about it
4320.92s: Is if I think that the value is like just so
4323.56s: Egregiously over what the cost is
4326.68s: Because then I can look at it and say like yeah like this absolutely will provide that because even the
4333.80s: Pro Tour at 50 bucks a month it's not cheap right like if you think 50 bucks a month that's like a gym membership
4339.64s: Or something like that but if you think of it in the context of trading how easy it is to lose 50 bucks
4345.16s: And if you learn something
4348.12s: In the pro community that keeps you from
4351.88s: Losing that 50 bucks that month it's paid for itself and then compounds right like that kind of thing
4357.00s: so the the big thing I'm trying to do for the future is
4361.80s: I don't know what the goal is going to be for next year
4365.64s: I'll have to take a look at the last like three years because it was what like 6,000 then this year was only like 1600
4373.16s: So I think like a fair like a reasonable growth trajectory would be like maybe
4378.44s: 7500 so try to get to like 42 five I think will be reasonable
4384.84s: Still a stretch still more than I typically grow by but
4389.16s: So I want to do that and the other big pillar is actually to continue to develop the community
4396.12s: That's the part that I love the most to be honest. I absolutely love the community
4401.56s: All right
4402.84s: Reggie says do you have a medium to long-term outlook on the market chance of a crash?
4407.80s: I look at the market right now and I think if there was in my mind like the potential for a correction or bear market
4417.80s: I think it's more now and then longer term on bullish. I don't think the inverse
4423.48s: I think that there's a little bit of jitteriness as per usual and in video just reported they reported really really well
4431.48s: And we had a good earnings season so S&P companies they're growing their year over year earnings by 13% so they're doing well
4441.24s: The economy is doing fine
4444.20s: I think this rhetoric about like a crash or a collapse
4449.00s: I think it's normal when we're hovering near all-time highs
4453.64s: But I think it's just so overused and abused
4457.64s: This pullback itself still was in a overall healthy configuration
4463.48s: It was a 4% pullback
4465.64s: Within the S&P 500 within spy and for those that don't know in spy
4471.64s: It spends the overwhelming majority of its time within 5% of all-time highs
4478.44s: So getting a sub 5% pullback is fine now
4484.60s: a little bit different than that though is I do think the breadth is not good
4490.68s: And I think that the way that the market is situated at this moment is still very weak in terms of what's driving returns
4499.56s: That's unhealthy and
4502.04s: That will need to either normalize or roll over and at least in the short term I do favor more
4510.36s: Roll over-ish
4512.04s: But we can see futures are up or decent right now as decks up 1.7%
4516.84s: E-minis are up one
4518.76s: Russell's about flat. I'm getting whacked on my bit composition, but even that's up a little bit
4526.60s: There's a lot of stuff that's still doing well
4530.60s: Even though when I look at breadth it's not looking good so if I were to summarize that into like a succinct market view for Reggie
4540.36s: I would
4542.04s: Summerize it as I actually favor near-term weakness and downside potential and then longer-term upside potential
4551.00s: And that's just because with AI growing as fast as it is
4555.96s: It's gonna continue to generate value at such an insane clip that it will
4561.48s: Overwhelm a lot of downside especially if stuff hits
4565.16s: More reasonable prices
4570.04s: Because right now
4571.96s: The S&P like average PE is still like really high
4576.68s: What's the average PE ratio or the S&P 500 and I just heard a scratch at the door so
4584.44s: Let me let me get the dude
4601.24s: That here he is
4604.44s: I've been letting him grow out
4606.84s: He's so poofy right now it's incredible
4610.28s: He's very stoic so he can be very talkative
4616.28s: But I think he's a little nervous when he's in front of you guys
4622.20s: He does like to be here. He was celebrating with us
4626.92s: Wanna go on your bed
4634.68s: There's the homie
4637.16s: All right
4638.60s: So yeah, that would be the synopsis near-term weakness
4642.84s: Long-reterm strength potential but near-term weakness I think at least is it right now
4648.52s: Goofy says true YouTube is built on the backs of hopes and dreams so many creators make less than minimum wage definitely
4654.44s: And the other thing is a lot of creators completely misunderstand like what it is the
4659.88s: The thing is either you have to provide a significant amount of utility or you have to be really entertaining and
4665.96s: People favor entertainment if you can be entertaining you can make a ton of money on YouTube especially if
4671.88s: You have like some sort of brand deal on top of what you make from your ads
4675.48s: You can make a lot of money but again that's the very small percentage those are the top performers that hit that
4683.16s: The
4684.68s: Return potential from entertainment is very high and it's literally because people like to be entertained
4692.04s: In something like options
4694.68s: There's not even that many fucking option traders in the US actually let's see if there's any metrics on that
4701.88s: And for those wondering right now the trailing PE for S&P is like 2829%
4708.92s: The forward PE is like 23% it's high like things are definitely high
4717.16s: How many options traders retail?
4721.72s: Are there in the US
4729.96s: Consumer research firm estimates between six and seven million are
4736.44s: Trading on marginal or using options so it's likely a few million that's probably the the best guess
4744.44s: So there just really isn't a ton
4747.32s: Glenary and says thoughts on brokers I use multiple I like how fidelity lets use specs as collateral for sewing puts tasty for more complex trades bit of leverage
4758.92s: I
4759.88s: Honestly have used
4761.40s: Thinkerswem since it was TD Ameritrade so
4764.68s: Started with TD Ameritrade now Schwab and
4767.24s: I've stayed with them the whole time I think as long as you're using a reputable broker
4772.52s: That's ultimately what matters if somebody was like hey could you outline the top two or three brokers?
4779.96s: I would
4781.56s: Schwab and then probably I be KR those would be the two that I would at least put on people's radar
4789.64s: And it's for a lot of different reasons but a lot of it has to do with the capability the platforms in the fill quality
4797.48s: It's difficult to assess fill quality but there are reports that come out periodically about brokers fill quality and
4806.12s: Places like Robinhood we bowl places like that have awful fill quality and typically places like IVKR and
4815.56s: Schwab
4817.24s: Prior TD Ameritrade typically a very good fill quality relative so that's where I would go is one of those nuts that's why I'm still
4826.84s: Using thinkerswem I'm not an affiliate with them at all. I make absolutely nothing in any capacity
4832.36s: I get no benefits from using their platform and using the platform you know on the channel with you guys
4837.80s: But they definitely have probably one of the most robust
4842.84s: free
4844.28s: Trading platforms that exist it's it really is good there's a lot of things as I've used it over the years that are left to be
4851.96s: Desired that I would like but those things aside it's insanely capable for what it is so
4859.80s: Yeah, that's that's where I would go
4862.76s: But that says thoughts on back testing which platform allows you to test earnings driven strategies input of
4868.68s: Prezice dates entries exit rules
4871.96s: I don't know any platform that does that the the trick with back testing is there really are not
4879.72s: They're really are not great platforms for that exist. I looked at building one because I'm so passionate
4886.28s: Specifically about back testing and paper trading and it's something that I want to do eventually
4891.96s: But I have to drastically increase the revenue that I make in order to even make it remotely worthwhile
4898.36s: Because the like to build a tool I have a buddy that would help me so I'd be able to do that cheaply
4904.44s: But the data is expensive and then the back end to it and the maintenance of the back end is also expensive
4913.48s: Eventually I would like to get there because I think it's extremely valuable
4918.36s: But yeah the the way that
4922.36s: Most professionals back test is through their own building so building something in Python or are
4930.92s: And then using some sort of met lab or other ingest to get data and
4938.52s: Literally testing that way. That's the only way I actually know how to do it in a way that I trust what I'm seeing
4945.16s: I don't know of any good back testing
4948.28s: Website at all if you guys know when I would love to know
4951.96s: Because I would be more than happy to reach out to them and ask if I can you know look through their tools and stuff
4959.00s: The other ones that are decent are things like options omega is actually the most decent one I know
4966.28s: But it's very specialized and their platform capability is very very very wrapped around
4973.56s: Like zero DTE's short term trading strategies and just a handful of underlines
4979.80s: So I don't really consider that like a back testing platform. It's really more a tool for almost a very specific strategy suite
4988.28s: Very different I use it. I like it. It's it's good to help like quickly fact check stuff
4995.32s: But it's super super specialized
5000.60s: So I don't actually know of a good one unfortunately
5005.88s: That is probably one of the the largest sources of work that
5012.68s: That go along with
5016.12s: Trading is that side of stuff
5021.56s: I'm in the process of trying to build like a end to end
5027.80s: organized
5031.40s: List of things that a trader needs to be able to do that's detailed and a big part of that
5040.12s: Is learning stats in probabilities which is pure luck that
5046.36s: My background largely overlaps with that
5052.04s: I can't say that name says could you open more charts? I think we're I think we're kind of at capacity
5058.92s: Maybe I could squeeze a few more on here
5061.24s: This is one of my favorite views to like very quickly see how the entire market is behaving
5069.56s: So in here we have all of the S&P sectors
5073.96s: We have all bonds all of the indices and we have a couple breadth indicators and then typically some sort of commodity
5083.24s: So I keep crude in there worth a dollar or Bitcoin like any of those kind of things
5090.44s: Yeah, this is like a really good
5093.32s: Visual snapshot of
5095.64s: How everything is doing and how everything is trending all of these are on six-month daily time frames
5101.56s: So you can actually see quite a lot in a fairly compressed space
5107.64s: This is where you can identify a lot of fun opportunities of strengthen weakness
5114.20s: One of those that have been
5117.24s: Following at least the live streams for a while is the relative strength that we've seen in health care compared to the other sectors
5124.20s: There's a lot of money to be made in health care if you take a look at the move that health care is had over the last
5131.88s: How long is this 40 bars so
5135.16s: Like two trading months this is like
5139.40s: 10% almost in the ETF itself
5144.52s: So then if we take a look within
5147.48s: this sector
5153.48s: You'll actually find that the the breadth is still highly centralized in a few names and these are names that we literally have talked about together
5163.40s: Specifically cardinal health e-Li-Lili
5166.20s: those have been
5168.20s: Absolutely leading the pack over the courts of this move. I had long positions straight up in both of them
5175.56s: and it's because the moves that you see here are way more profound starting in October and it's an earnings catalyst
5186.20s: So they did really really well and
5189.48s: Ely Lili also did really really well these are both simple post earnings announcement drift trades
5195.40s: This one has generated 30% return over three trading weeks
5200.68s: This is like the easy side of trading and it exists a lot of people don't know
5206.68s: To look here or how to find it and that is normal it takes time to build the experience to do this
5214.04s: But it is really really easy once you learn how to look for stuff to find things like this
5220.76s: And this is realistically what I spend
5224.28s: Most of like the discretionary time for what I'm looking for is fine and stuff like this that are just
5230.12s: kind of easy money
5233.00s: So it looks like JJ or JIs point all of this starts by typically looking at one of those really crowded looking charts
5244.44s: Naden says I always have a hard time getting in good entries because I think if someone went up 30%
5249.72s: I'm scared that it would not go up anymore
5252.28s: Yeah, that is because there's not a defined profit mechanism
5258.28s: If you don't have a defined profit mechanism in what you're doing and you don't have an understanding of what that profit mechanism
5265.64s: Typically looks like your sensation that you're describing is very normal
5270.36s: But if you go through the effort and
5274.04s: You actually define the profit mechanism you learn how it behaves
5278.36s: Then you actually develop a really really good intuitive sense of like where stuff is where it may or may not go
5286.04s: All of those kind of decisions actually become much much easier to
5290.52s: Identify and the other thing that becomes really easy is like the risk mitigation side of the equation
5296.20s: So for stuff like this it's it's pure it literally is pure
5302.20s: asymmetric opportunity let's take a look I'll grab the trade details for Lily and
5309.08s: We'll look at it just because we're in here and they reported before the market on the 30th
5314.36s: So let's go back to the 30th really fast just so that you can get a sense of
5320.44s: What this kind of thing can do
5329.24s: And I have a set for 0 830 and then let me find the trade details
5337.16s: All right so first things first
5341.16s: The entry was after a break out a
5347.16s: above this so the entry didn't happen here and
5352.28s: It's because the move on the day was weak and there was nothing there that was interesting enough to me
5359.96s: The entry for me actually happens when there is a clean decisive break over this which happened in here
5369.48s: So I'm finding the specific time where that breaks bingo where that breaks started to meaningfully accelerate here
5377.80s: and
5379.80s: I had two pieces to this trade I had a midterm ratio called diagonal
5387.16s: And then I had a near term long call really gamma based play was the purpose of it
5395.56s: So what I'm doing right now is I'm scaling it
5398.68s: to a hundred thousand dollar portfolio that's what we typically use in these so that you have a sense of
5405.88s: what the returns
5408.20s: look like
5410.76s: with fuck
5414.12s: Trying to find some sort of
5417.16s: trade logs somewhere
5419.48s: There we go
5428.68s: I'm going to move this off to the side so that we could take a look the near term play
5435.00s: lies well realize we don't kind of needle
5437.96s: Madness this is a little too much
5446.04s: Oh this one's good
5453.24s: This one has what we need
5456.20s: So the date for this is 31 oct and
5463.16s: there were two positions
5467.64s: that
5471.24s: I put on
5475.48s: first
5478.44s: Bob Price was
5481.08s: 863 so as we started breaking above that handle
5486.28s: and again I have to
5487.88s: nail the the trades really quick so the first one was here
5492.36s: and it was a 30 delta
5497.72s: so these were uh
5499.72s: they were like 12.25 is what I thought
5501.80s: but this was the 900's
5507.16s: 125
5510.20s: Delta was .30
5512.92s: Gamma just because I want you to see how those
5515.08s: change
5516.60s: date it was negative .523
5519.96s: and then Vega was .738
5525.32s: and
5526.84s: if we look at
5529.00s: where the trade is wrong
5532.12s: it's essentially at
5535.56s: it's a close below 828
5540.04s: so if we take a look
5543.00s: and put that with E
5546.92s: then I can size it
5549.80s: 821
5552.04s: so that's 12
5554.28s: 49 a $100,000 account you get a one lot
5557.96s: so it's about a percent that's good
5560.12s: and then for the base position
5565.64s: which was a 90 day
5568.36s: diagonal and it was the 850 just because they were a little bit more
5575.32s: and that one 850
5581.48s: picked up
5583.24s: want to say it was like 6-1-ish
5586.44s: .58 is our delta
5588.68s: Gamma's .003
5591.00s: data is negative .35
5596.20s: and then Vega is 1.55
5600.76s: okay
5605.48s: and let's fast forward
5607.64s: and I'll walk you through a couple
5609.96s: decision points
5612.28s: first let's go like
5615.48s: what was it the 31st let's go half a week
5618.68s: ish
5623.16s: so here
5625.88s: there's a key decision point for me
5630.20s: this is normally when stuff like this
5633.00s: especially smaller names
5635.24s: have big moves like this
5636.68s: they're very frequently can be a reversal
5638.92s: somewhere in this point especially when the moving averages are this
5642.84s: spread apart and
5645.64s: more importantly than that
5648.44s: the reversal can often be like a pretty aggressive gap down
5653.64s: now in bigger names like this
5655.96s: that's a little less common
5659.08s: but still can happen
5661.24s: so on 21-0 this position won't have enough room
5666.44s: just because it's built for a smaller account
5669.64s: right I'm scaling this to $100,000
5672.60s: but I took off the front
5675.32s: which was the five-nove
5677.08s: spot price was 948
5679.64s: and the premium was 6225
5686.04s: and then
5687.96s: the other position
5690.44s: no change I let that one alone and then I'll explain why
5695.32s: so what this option did was
5699.16s: generally speaking what it was supposed to do
5703.56s: and what this option was supposed to do
5706.92s: was rapidly compound
5711.40s: and it's because of the the gamma element to it
5715.08s: which I'll explain to you guys in this
5717.88s: I'm just getting to rest of the math
5720.28s: that up
5723.80s: this times
5729.64s: then I need a
5732.12s: I don't invest in capital
5736.52s: relic
5738.76s: and that equals
5742.76s: by did by
5747.40s: value
5748.04s: so
5754.68s: times
5756.68s: this times one
5763.80s: as a person
5770.12s: so
5772.28s: this had a
5775.64s: really really aggressive
5778.68s: start off
5780.76s: and I'll show you what it looks like so far
5784.84s: so the position originally was put on
5788.36s: at 863 and again scaled for a $100,000 portfolio
5792.44s: based on where I would take a loss
5794.76s: it was about like a 1.2% risk to the portfolio
5800.52s: it was bought for 1225
5803.08s: and then again like
5805.72s: 3,4 trading days later
5809.08s: the underlying moved 9.9%
5813.24s: and the premium moved
5815.96s: actually really significantly
5818.76s: and this needs to be fixed
5821.24s: because it needs an absolute value for these
5825.56s: I have it
5826.92s: like I just kind of cobbled this thing together
5829.72s: but the premium itself scaled
5838.36s: actually a lot
5840.20s: oops
5841.80s: I'm so value this
5843.24s: divide by
5846.12s: absolute value of this
5851.16s: so the option compounded massively
5855.24s: and
5855.72s: this
5860.84s: this here
5863.80s: is the first part of the base position
5866.52s: and it's really designed to compound like I said
5870.12s: very quickly it's a little bit different
5872.84s: when we look at the longer term position now
5876.44s: so this one's completely off
5878.76s: and then we had the 16 Jan
5882.76s: the 9 or the 850s we were slightly in the money
5890.60s: so those now are going for like 127
5896.04s: for context
5898.60s: and these have compounded but less so
5902.84s: notice the change in terms of return on a vested capital
5907.64s: the reason for the
5910.28s: gap here is because these don't compound as much
5915.40s: the underlying the premium itself
5917.96s: still
5919.40s: appreciated handsomely but it's significantly less
5923.24s: than what you saw here
5924.76s: and that's because these have less gamma
5927.00s: but the purpose for this position is
5930.76s: really to give me more time
5933.64s: to ride more of the trend with the momentum following approach
5937.64s: so I will walk you through that in a sec
5942.68s: AJ says with my Patreon question removed no I don't see
5946.68s: anything in there what was the what was your question
5951.88s: yeah I didn't see anything but
5954.44s: let me know and it says
5956.52s: been on the fence joining wanted some convincing
5959.08s: honestly I'm not the guy for that like I really
5961.64s: wouldn't try to convince anybody one way or the other if you have
5964.12s: questions about it happy to answer
5967.48s: but I really really think it's a decision like
5970.68s: somebody should make for themselves and whatever is right for you
5974.60s: now but yeah let me know whatever your question wasn't
5977.48s: I'll take a look it's just I don't see it on the chat
5981.24s: let's take a look at the rest of this move
5984.04s: and I'll walk you through a little bit of the decision making
5987.80s: which by the way this is actually something I would do
5990.68s: on the Patreon typically just because it's kind of like a
5993.40s: play by play of the whole thing
5995.88s: this here actually doesn't denote in exit yet
6000.52s: the reason why it doesn't denote in exit yet for this specific strategy
6005.32s: is it hasn't gotten anywhere near the short-term moving average
6011.72s: that I'm using to follow the broader trend
6015.80s: but I do want you to notice how it behaved on this reversal
6019.64s: day it's important to note how it behaved on this reversal day
6023.40s: and this is because you can give up several days of gains
6028.28s: on these reversal days right so take a look at open here
6032.36s: rallied all the way up here close here gapped up again open here rallied up here close
6037.40s: here and then on this reversal day it's just done done the last two days by itself
6042.44s: and this is only a few hours into the trading day
6047.08s: these reversal days especially in stuff like this can be kind of nasty
6052.12s: so you have to have a game plan in place but that one wasn't in exit criteria for me
6058.84s: and it's literally because of this factor it didn't actually
6062.36s: violate any of my like trend following rules so if we go to the end of the week
6068.76s: you'll see now it's a different it's a different perspective
6073.72s: it's a different perspective because at this point it's starting to consolidate
6078.04s: a little bit still too early to take an exit in my world this would be
6084.12s: viable for some sort of partial exit but when something consolidates like this
6090.12s: I typically don't expect to see some sort of massive gap drop down like I would this
6096.44s: being able to turn into so if we go to the last day that's available at least in here
6103.88s: and show you the spot price it's still continuing to trend sideways
6108.84s: this is where I would scale out part of the position again these are one
6113.72s: launch because it's scaled to a hundred thousand dollar account but I'll give you a sense of
6118.76s: what those are running for now just so that you can get an idea of what they're trading at which is
6124.84s: like 195 and now the underlying is at 1029 so on a trade that we that's not correct
6140.76s: you should be this so on a trade that we put up a total of like 7325 that again this is scaled to
6150.92s: a hundred thousand dollar account even though it's 7325 in terms of the overall debit
6156.92s: there that's not how much would actually be at risk in the trade and then here is where it's
6165.16s: sitting at right now which would give us a total p and l of 18,400 so it's a little over doubling
6173.08s: your money at least in terms of the allocation it's easier to do that with kind of these allocations
6180.68s: because it's not all of your money a lot of times when people see returns like this they think like oh
6186.20s: man like if I do that with my whole account then I'll be you know making a bunch of money really quick
6193.00s: and it will be great the problem is like maximizing a position like this with your entire account
6201.16s: is really really fucking hard and the reason why it's super super hard is because then there's a
6208.76s: lot of emotion that goes into it you're like damn I really want this to work and so on and so forth
6214.60s: so these are again it's just one example of an individual trade it's actually just a
6224.20s: very simple poster and announcement drift that's actually still on and it's because we had three
6229.32s: consolidating days definitely good strength but I didn't like that they were slightly descending
6235.56s: and that's okay take some profit I took two thirds and now there's a third left on that leg
6244.20s: now I see and we take a look at how it eventually resolves but that's just
6251.88s: Eli Lilly and the thing that I want you to pay attention to is let's scale this really quick from
6259.08s: $100,000 to a million dollar account the reason why I want to show you this scale is because the
6267.08s: percentages are one thing but the gross is different this is the gross for an appropriately
6275.08s: scaled version of this position in a million dollar account this is $184,000 that matters because
6285.24s: even though the percent returns are good and stuff like that the more important part here is like
6290.60s: this is real money right like that's a okay salary for people this is when you can
6300.44s: actually begin to live a decent life off of stuff like this now again this is just one trade there's
6306.92s: plenty of versions of this where it's a loser instead of a winner and if you remember this was
6312.28s: risking about two grants a little more than two grand between these two positions so in the
6317.72s: context here you're risking like 20 grand but in the million dollar account scaled the 20 grand here
6326.20s: is granting you the potential in this case so far for 184 which it's still not quite done yet so
6335.96s: this is when it was marked at 1029 so the way that this would actually work is like this
6343.80s: two thirds come out ish and then the remainder is here and let's just take a look at what it's worth
6354.12s: today that same same option as it sits now the eight fifty those are now two
6366.60s: who's 13 so the position is total at 195 something like that so that's an example of using
6383.24s: this really busy chart grid to find where strength is as far as a sector and then stacking strength
6393.16s: finding more strength within that sector and then finding a couple things to play straights and
6398.68s: make some money
6402.36s: AJ was just wanted to see an intro and an example to get a sense of what they get oh yeah if you're
6408.36s: curious about that you should also just go to the patreon because on the membership page for the patreon
6416.28s: there's a pretty in-depth description about like what you actually get I don't even think I can
6423.88s: paste it in here because it's there's a lot I can paste the link to the membership page and if you go to
6430.92s: like pro which is like the the base tier for folks the description literally lists out like everything
6437.80s: so you'll see like what the three different weekly streams are what the community opportunities are
6442.60s: stuff like that and then it'll all be in there for you that's a completely fair question right like I
6448.04s: would want to know what I'm getting if I'm buying something to for sure all right gang it is time for me to
6454.52s: grab dinner I want to extend another very gracious thank you all for being a part of what this thing is
6461.72s: it's really really fun in general I know it's me sharing like a lifetime of experience so the the
6471.64s: value proposition is skewed from that lens but I really enjoy interacting with you all I love
6480.44s: the people that we kind of bring into the community what kind of folks this thing attracts and
6487.16s: I'm super super stoked to continue growing with you all and like getting to know you all better I
6493.08s: literally have people now in the community that I like no should have known for five fucking years
6499.16s: it's like not a trivial amount of time to know somebody so that's the other really cool thing is like
6504.36s: actually building relationships which I enjoy so here's to 35 for next year we're gunning for 42
6512.04s: five we'll see how well I deliver be in outlier do you guys better
