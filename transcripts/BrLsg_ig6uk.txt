0.00s:  you
0.00s:  What's up, everyone? Welcome back to the outlier podcast. I got my friend and friendly
5.82s:  face, Matthew Caruso from Caruso insights. What's up, man? Welcome back.
9.44s:  Yeah, I think it's driving me back Eric. It's always a pleasure.
12.08s:  Absolutely. Pleasure. We're sitting there kind of BS in for a little bit about how I
16.36s:  essentially just the ultimate failure and it's kind of fun to figure out what other ways
19.66s:  I can mess things up. But it's always good to talk to people like you that are figuring
23.56s:  it out. You just had a really awesome trip over to Europe. I mean, talk to us about that.
29.26s:  What do you think? For me, life, markets, everything's all one puzzle that's all wrapped
35.38s:  up. So now having two small boys, like I said, being able to show them the history in
38.86s:  person and Italy and Rome. And there's just just a phenomenal get outside, get into
43.54s:  mountains, exercise and physical conditioning too. It was just wonderful trip. Great way
48.42s:  to also rest the mind and recharge the batteries. Just fantastic.
51.86s:  Yeah. Now, what kind of stuff did your boys really enjoy doing? What did they gravitate
57.38s:  to? So it's so we started off in the mountains and we did some like mountain biking and just
63.26s:  like being a lot outside. So they just love like and that's amazing thing about kids.
66.82s:  They just love that freedom. They just like be out there and just explore open pastures.
72.02s:  Mountains was great. And so it was funny that there was like the two extremes that
74.98s:  part and they enjoyed the beach and pool like period, but they also just like loved Rome
79.02s:  and the history. And so for me as a history lover, it's great. Like I was saying, show
82.94s:  them like, Hey, like you see that balcony there? Like that's then you show them on your
85.82s:  phone. That's where Mussolini was, you know, whipping up the crowds and all that like before,
90.06s:  like World War II kicked off. And like even at like six years old, they're like amazed.
94.14s:  And even for me, it kind of gives me chills to see it all like in the same place. So it's
97.50s:  pretty awesome. It's also a good reminder like markets, everything and like things repeat
100.78s:  and what to be aware of. So it was awesome.
103.58s:  Well, and one of the cool things that you were telling me right before we started talking
107.22s:  is that how your what one of your sons was like really starting to like pick up the gravity
112.86s:  of things. And like I just feel like that's got to be so cool to be able to experience them
117.98s:  experiencing that that's got to be just so fun for you. Yeah, like just for them to see how
125.26s:  like the world, you know, they still see things very black and white, but to see them start
128.30s:  to like connect the dots of how everything and how the world functions and you know, they grow up
133.10s:  in a nice environment and then to see like, Oh, there could be bad actors out there and the
137.42s:  repercussions and all that. So it's amazing to see it kind of almost relearn it through someone
142.14s:  else's eyes again. It's it's a great experience. So cool. So cool. Dude, I love that. So one of the
147.34s:  things I like to ask traders specifically that do stuff like that though is how do you set your
152.22s:  portfolio when you go on vacation mode because funny enough I just telling you I was just in Alaska.
158.30s:  And I had to go through a similar process that I always find interesting to try to describe to
162.38s:  people, but as you know, I love learning your approach to stuff. So what do you do with your
165.98s:  portfolio before he bounts? You know, it's I feel like I'm cursed. If I go with a lot of positions,
171.18s:  like the market tanks, if I go with no positions, the market rips. So it's like you kind of
174.70s:  have been trouble. But you know, like I learned even on my honeymoon, I ended up spending way
178.46s:  more money on losses than I did on my honeymoon because I became an attentive and positions won
182.30s:  against me. So I I never fully disconnect because I I find even being completely away for three weeks,
187.98s:  you lose that touch and that feel. So I'll always have a couple of things definitely watch every day,
192.86s:  but just really reduce size. And I just I make sure that I can at least check market open. So I can
198.22s:  put in stop orders if need be. And then I can go on my own. But you know, having like 30% exposure,
203.26s:  not the same as having 120% exposure. So at least if you're you have light positioning and you
208.46s:  just at least you're watching you get the best of both worlds. You get to have like a a mind that's
213.10s:  not overly kind of way down by markets. And at the same time, you keep your kind of feel with the
217.34s:  market. Yeah, that's awesome. Do you find any benefit from not being as over the portfolio? I know
224.54s:  for me sometimes, especially if I'm running more programmatic style trades, so definitely a little
229.50s:  bit different than what you're doing. But if I'm like trying to churn out risk premiums,
234.14s:  a big part of that is just occurrences. And sometimes it is not fun watching one of those occurrences
239.42s:  burn into a fiery flame. And you're just like, okay, I guess I guess I should watch this. And at
244.62s:  least for me, I find it easier. Cause it's just like I put the stuff on, put on the stops as I need
251.42s:  them. And then I just check at the end of the day, I'm just like, how'd I go? What would we do? And
254.78s:  it's like, okay, I lost on all of these terrible, but I don't care. Cause I'm going to go do this
259.50s:  other really cool thing. Is there any element of that for you? Or is it mostly because I know you
263.66s:  trade very differently and typically very concentrated. So it sounds like sizing down as a big part of
268.86s:  how you set up like your day to day. But do you find any benefit from detaching a little bit more?
276.30s:  I do, you know, every so often, like every like several months or at least like once a year,
282.94s:  I try and take like a really step back and like question like the different elements of the
286.38s:  approach. And like one, like I was a like market maker, like I lived markets, like I'd have like
291.26s:  hundreds hundreds of trades a day, you know, and and then even as you gravitate to like more
295.34s:  but position trading, like that stays in you, you know, so like so being able to step away,
300.78s:  it's like, okay, can I can I do this? Like how much of my time is actually wasted or how much is
305.74s:  is like working against me staring at the screens versus just losing stop orders? Because I
309.82s:  you know, I have a lot of like clients and stuff that where they, you know, everything is just
312.86s:  functioned off of like, you know, trigger points and that. So I mean, it works for them, but then I
316.94s:  I tend to just sit in front of the screen all day and watch price action. It's like, hey,
320.54s:  is that actually helping or working against me? So like when you're your market making,
324.62s:  obviously it's critical, but like in this environment, I mean, sometimes you'll cash that extra
329.34s:  opportunity, but you got to weigh that against like, does it, you know, pull on your impulses to
333.26s:  put on a trade you should end? I mean, we're all human. You still do kind of make those those
336.94s:  impulse decisions sometimes. So it's nice to kind of like question like, hey, if I'm really
341.02s:  away from the screens, you know, does it help or does it make it worse and what's the impact on?
346.14s:  Like for me, touch and feels important. It's like I try and quantify as much as I can, make things
350.54s:  as black and white as possible, but there's always a little bit of that like that innate gut feeling
354.78s:  where like even if your your system tells you to be long, like you want to attack it like with like
360.14s:  the full aggressive posturing of your system, or do you want to like make it a little more relaxed?
365.02s:  I find that confidence comes from that feel. So it's trying to kind of manage, manage both.
370.06s:  Yeah, it sounds a lot like from Malcolm Gladwell's Blink and I think he's the right author for that book.
377.74s:  There's a book called Blink and it's very much about subconscious processing and priming.
383.02s:  So when you talk about that idea of like this touch and like the feel of the markets,
389.34s:  it's funny because when you talk to people that don't really understand it, it's like very esoteric,
393.26s:  it kind of just sounds whimsical like nothing. But then when you're actually like a practitioner of it,
398.78s:  you get like I literally know exactly what you're talking about because I actually think it's a
404.70s:  bigger part of what a lot of traders do, especially more discretionary traders that are not,
409.74s:  you know, just algorithmic in nature. So when you're taking a step back in your analyzing what
415.66s:  you're doing, you're kind of seeing like this process that I'm following, value-ad versus value-not-ad,
420.86s:  do you have any examples of something that when you're looking at it, you realize that this is not
425.74s:  actually tremendous value-ad? Yeah, you know, it's sometimes it's the merging of, you're trying to
433.34s:  merge like processes in your mind. So it's like there's certain tools and or applications that
438.70s:  work well with how it's day trading. And so the impulse will still come out. Like you can see that
443.58s:  in the short term, I can say it goes as a short term opportunity. But then after when you're
446.94s:  positioning or what like it throws off a larger strategy, let's say you're not right about that
451.50s:  move, then it affects your average cost. And so like sometimes, you know, even though it looks like
456.30s:  a good setup in the short term, trying to like through impulse kind of merge two different
461.58s:  approaches kind of work against you. But you know, but everything like you kind of touch on,
466.22s:  it came more to the forefront for me. I was at one point, I got really deep into like kind of
470.62s:  redalue when everything he did and like what he calls like kind of the golden system about how he
476.78s:  manages risks with diversification, like which is very different from how I approach things.
480.62s:  I saw in several interviews where he like they asked him like what do you attribute your success to?
486.06s:  Like in different interviews, different times, he's like meditation. For me, it's like I agree,
490.38s:  it's like meditation. It was like the most unexpected answer I could have expected, you know, but
495.58s:  I think as you go on with time as a trader, especially when you go through periods of drawdown,
498.94s:  like when you're fresh, you're new, it's like let's go, let's go, let's go. And but then when you kind
502.38s:  of get go through like the meat grinder a little bit, like you realize how like keeping your mind centered
507.02s:  and focus is so that's almost the difference between those who end up succeeding and those are just
510.78s:  drop off eventually. Yeah, it will and it's funny when you, you know, chuckle about the responsive
517.66s:  meditation because one of the things that I find with practitioners that get good at pretty much
524.14s:  anything they're doing over the long run, they essentially just boil things down into like
529.82s:  these really seemingly simple things, but there are things that are done really well.
535.34s:  I always get a kick out of that, like even in the military, there's a bunch of times that you
539.10s:  would talk to dudes about the way that they thought about this process. And the process itself can be
545.66s:  insanely complex, like markets, but then they'll literally just boil it down to slow as smooth,
552.14s:  smooth as fast. Like, what does that even mean? Like, what does that mean? What do I do with that?
558.86s:  And it's really eye opening though. And I think it's important for people to hear those kinds
563.10s:  of messages because it goes back to what I, what Leonardo da Vinci, I think he said, um,
569.74s:  simplicity is the ultimate form of sophistication. And I love that line because I noticed people
575.42s:  that get really good at trading or other things. They're really good at breaking things down into
580.46s:  their core concepts, simple and doing them really well, really, really well. So that's an interesting
587.02s:  one to hear from your perspective though, because I like the way that you're kind of talking about
591.34s:  balancing those two parts, those two systems in the mind. When you're on your vacation,
599.26s:  it sounds like you're like me where I still absolutely look at markets. And for me, it's very
604.38s:  rarely because like, I'm like a crack head and I'm like, oh, I just got to get a peak. Like,
609.42s:  it's just because much like you, I love markets. It's, I enjoy them. So when you're looking at markets
618.14s:  though in a pare-down sense, what are the really key things that you're focusing on? Like, if you
623.18s:  already give somebody a cliff notes version of, if they're going on a trip and they're asking you
627.82s:  like, hey, Matt, you know, what are some good things I should look at to be super efficient when I'm
632.62s:  looking at markets? Was that look like? You know, it's, so it's fine that there's a, I'm sure you
636.94s:  know the book Reminist is a stock operator. There's so many little things you can pull from that book.
641.98s:  But I remember there was one chapter where he was talking about like a great trader and he would
646.22s:  like pace back and forth across the room, but like with a predictable like, like, tempo, like,
650.14s:  I think like every 30 minutes he'd go to the ticker tape and check a quote. And like part of the story
654.70s:  was like, he basically eventually let us all know that by checking like at a regular interval,
658.78s:  if it's every hour or every two hours, you get a sense for how markets are reacting over those
663.34s:  intervals. So instead of checking like after five minutes after four hours and after two minutes,
667.42s:  like by having kind of like a more like systematic approach, you get a sense of like, let's say you
671.74s:  check the first half hour of the day, you know, pretty much like volume price action, what goes on
676.22s:  in the first half hour. So like I try even on vacation, have kind of like a different times
681.58s:  that I'll regularly check. And also I just check for like the outlier moves, you know, like the outlier
686.30s:  podcast, so basically, you know, who are like, especially if it's summertime, like I try and
691.74s:  ignore all of the like, just the stocks of 1% down 1%, like it's already kind of dramatic outperformance
697.26s:  by stocks, like and beyond one day. So for up today is your fall through the next day or it's just
701.18s:  like summer chop, summer churn. So just trying to try to try to at least like decipher if there's
706.94s:  any sustainable trend or if it's just noise, like that's just kind of just trying to like get,
710.86s:  you know, I have less time. So I want to focus on like what's the signal coming from the market?
715.10s:  Got it. Yeah, I love that. So then when you're looking at the rest of your portfolio, though,
720.70s:  like you're talking about you size down a lot, are you still ready to jump at opportunities if you see
726.70s:  them? Or is it just kind of monitoring things, keeping a pulse, and then you'll really get back to
731.66s:  things when you get back at the office? I'll do like a little bit like I just try and avoid getting
736.38s:  fully invested like because then like your mind is distracted. You're like, you could be with the
741.50s:  kids on a mountain top and you know, a dad come and play and then you're like, you're glued to your
744.94s:  phone, which especially if like, you know, of course the way it is the next day, the markets
748.62s:  will open up down and you're gonna have to like worry about who's getting stopped out and you're
752.06s:  on your phone and then the connection maybe is not great. So to a certain extent, at least if you're
756.14s:  like 50% invested, you know, there's only so much pain that can come from a mistake. So I still try
761.58s:  and like keep myself on the reduced side of things just in case something goes awry, you don't have
767.50s:  access or whatever happens. Yeah, yeah, makes a ton of sense. So talk to me a little bit about
773.26s:  your perception of what the market's done so far this year. And actually one of the things I want
778.30s:  to highlight specifically and get your take on was the series of moves essentially that started
784.54s:  from the first of August, then over the second and then the fifth like those three days specifically
791.90s:  were really interesting to me personally, but I'm curious if they were anything special to you
797.26s:  or just what you made of that move there. So this year, it's a really interesting year because
803.66s:  when we spoke about our own past podcasts together, like I always fall like to fall like
808.94s:  the net highs, like number of stocks making 52 week highs versus 52 week lows. And that hasn't been
813.66s:  very accurate this year. It's been very wonky because what we're going through, like,
819.42s:  bouts of inflation messes up the normal mechanics of markets. Like that's why like you saw like in the
824.70s:  past couple of years, like, you know, the like the 60, 40 portfolios all kind of blew up because
829.82s:  bonds. So so inflation breaks the regular like functioning of the market. The market still function,
835.18s:  but the regular relationships go in opposite directions. And so I think coming off the bottom,
841.18s:  we're starting to kind of get that rebound once inflation peaked even though the Fed had
845.10s:  and cut rates and all that yet. But we entered in this thing like basically like a
848.62s:  cable recovery, like they're saying, there's a few stocks are doing really great, but then there's
851.74s:  a lot of stocks are not doing well, like not doing great at all, which not that every cycle everyone's
856.70s:  doing fantastic, but like the disparity between the few and the many has been larger than any kind
862.54s:  of normal cycle in recent in the recent past. So that's been exacerbated with AI and how large
868.06s:  caps have led. And again, if you go back historically, if you look at like each year, who's like like the
873.66s:  the biggest two or three stocks at the S&P 500, those don't tend to be the market leaders that year
879.10s:  because they're so big, they're so kind of cumbersome. They'll go up with the market, but they're not
882.38s:  going to lead. So this combination of like the AI push and like inflation causing this
887.42s:  cable recovery is as make things very wonky this year. And so and you can see the how like when the
892.06s:  small caps broke out like late July, you had a flurry of stocks making 50s and you guys and at the
897.66s:  same time, the Nasdaq rolled over hard. So you have this very weird like small caps and large caps
902.70s:  were almost like inversely correlated for a couple of weeks. So I think I think we're still kind
908.14s:  of nursing the hangovers of all of the inflation and all the stimulus, which I think once we finally
913.18s:  get inflation back down to line, again, normal nature of the market just it gets everyone to think
917.90s:  that, hey, those tools don't work anymore or that that process doesn't work and then it goes back
921.98s:  into line and everything works again. So I think the way the market's been reacting was like you
928.94s:  mentioned those days specifically is I think the market's shifted from an inflation concern to
933.90s:  more one of recession. And also I think a lot of the the AI hype that's really driven a big part
940.14s:  of that like spread between the halves and have knots. It's kind of like show me the money now like
944.38s:  people spent a lot of money on cap X. It's been a lot of like enormous market cap gains.
950.46s:  Is that going to actually come to fruition? I think through earnings it hasn't been a good
953.26s:  earnings season. So there's a bit of like concern with that. So I think there was a bit of that catch
958.06s:  of move within the whole yen carry trade like was this giant bomb that like exacerbated everything
964.22s:  and again we're still having these rebounding ramifications. So I'm hopeful that once we kind of
970.46s:  get inflation back to normal, all the regular relationships are going to work and I can already see
975.18s:  a lot of companies that are acting well that I think once we kind of get ourselves back into a
979.42s:  healthy uptrend, we'll have like the very normal action of these nice mid cap stocks outperforming
984.54s:  and all the rest. There's like 62 questions I want to ask you at once. There is a ton of really
993.10s:  cool details. I'm going to start with specifically the relationship between small caps and large cap.
999.58s:  So a lot of what you were talking about in terms of just price behavior totally made sense.
1006.70s:  Now what are your thoughts on the rationale behind the seemingly I wouldn't call it inversely
1014.62s:  correlated personally but maybe not correlated or something but definitely a not normal correlation
1020.06s:  that I feel very confident saying I just don't know what the numbers are off the top of my head.
1024.38s:  But when you're looking at large and small, what do you make of the relationship there and how it
1030.06s:  got so defiant? So I think again because of the K-shape recovery, it just made sense that
1037.98s:  I think funds started to move to the safety of large companies who had pricing power and all the
1042.14s:  rest and then I think AI just kind of fell into their lap. They were already kind of a long large cap
1047.10s:  and like shying away from small cap for that reason. Then AI was just this big like, oh whoa,
1052.14s:  right place, right time, let's take off running and they went for the liquidity.
1055.98s:  But it's interesting because and again, it's how kind of like the current situation shapes the narrative
1061.42s:  but people will say like now often like, oh, you know, funds prefer large cap stocks which is true.
1066.06s:  But if you go back to like the cap M and all the pricing models, like a you know,
1070.94s:  efficient market theory and all that kind of stuff, like at one point small caps were always out
1075.98s:  performing large. And so they even had kind of like a like a like a like a like a like a how can I put it like
1085.18s:  a specific like outlier situation where like oh, small caps will kind of outperform because
1090.30s:  they're higher risk. So that's why you'll tend to you know that you'll tend to kind of do better
1093.74s:  than what would be efficient. So like they made it that's they made an exception for small caps like
1097.74s:  20 years ago, but now because they've underperformance like oh no large caps will outperform because
1101.98s:  like liquidity is there and all that. So the narrative changes over time. But in general in a normal
1106.78s:  market cycle, correlations should be generally positive. I mean, no, it's the rising tide lifts all
1112.54s:  boats like usually if Microsoft's doing well, it's because they're selling office subscriptions to
1116.22s:  small medium-sized businesses. It's very rare that the largest five are doing phenomenal and
1121.98s:  everybody else is not. So I think it's a weird moment in time which happens, which is kind of a
1128.06s:  combination of inflation, safety trade, then suddenly like an infrastructure rollout that kind of
1132.70s:  popped out out of nowhere, which I think will kind of come into line and we're going to see the
1135.74s:  normal relationships show up soon. I see. Next question. What did you make of the velocity of small caps
1144.54s:  on the way up first? So kind of talking about that gap day, was it like the the 11th or the 12th
1151.50s:  and then the subsequent like three or four days after that? What I know that you're a student of
1156.78s:  markets and market history and price behavior. Did you make anything specific of the velocity of
1162.54s:  that move? So that was my concern. So even like with clients who are saying like, oh, you know,
1166.38s:  now that we have these net highs, do we have this big bull market starting now because like small caps
1170.06s:  took off. And so my concern, and this is like where the gut instinct will still kind of come in
1174.14s:  because you have this indicator and just knowing that there's some weird kind of issues going on
1178.70s:  because of this disparity. But what I think happened was that just like what the yen carry trade
1183.82s:  that blew up, it was the crowd of trade. Everyone was large, long large cap tech, short small caps.
1188.86s:  And then we just went the other way really quickly as things started to reverse. So I think it was
1193.02s:  just more of a big short squeeze like an basically a long squeeze on the long push people out both
1198.30s:  directions. And that's why you just got so incredibly negatively correlated because I think that was
1202.94s:  just funds way off base way overly concentrated being blown out in both directions. And so that's
1208.94s:  why I think now you can see that that relationship has kind of fallen back into a little bit more normal
1213.26s:  seed than what it was for a little while there. Got it. Okay. And then same question for the drawdown
1220.54s:  side of things. I personally thought it was really interesting that we saw Russell pop. I mean,
1227.34s:  it was like one of the largest moves it's had in its history over a seven day period. It was just
1231.18s:  incredible. And then over a three day period, it literally undies all of it. I was like, I was sitting
1239.26s:  there. I was just like, what is going on? Like that's crazy to me. And I always thought it was a
1246.14s:  little bit of just a overly reactive market, like very emphatic is what it seemed like to me.
1253.66s:  Like just people, it's funny. You mentioned the idea of like this rapid repositioning because
1258.54s:  that's what it felt like. That's kind of what I was seeing. But the way down typically quicker,
1264.46s:  but did you make anything special about that three day period, essentially where it just
1268.86s:  undid that entire move? Yeah, I think it was just easy come easy goes. Whenever like and sometimes
1276.14s:  the market, there's that there's so many elements of this market. It's like long term, like yeah,
1280.86s:  fundamental price action will fall, fundamental in the short term positioning is what dominates.
1285.82s:  Like I mean, the fundamentals could be what they want, but if everyone is short, you're going to
1289.02s:  get let me look at the game stop. I mean, like that's the extreme example. But like even if that's
1294.54s:  like, you know, in theory, the extreme point, there's different variations of that. So just like
1299.42s:  the carriage trade, I mean, look at the Nika, like the entire index, like what are they? I think
1304.22s:  the third largest economy in the world, you went from like all time highs to like 30% correction,
1308.70s:  like biggest drops since 1987 within two weeks. And that's because positioning was so extreme. And
1314.94s:  again, we spoke about that K kind of recovery where some are benefiting and most are not. Well,
1320.70s:  even if that's the case, getting overly one-sided, then brings up these other kind of risks.
1325.02s:  And it's not that for I mean, other times I've traded, I remember the carriage trade blown up
1328.14s:  in the past and you always see this kind of, you know, the oil trades blown up, the gold trades,
1332.46s:  every so often a trade blows up somewhere. So always be cautious when it's like a very obvious
1337.26s:  positioning, like you need to be careful. Yeah, yeah, interesting. Yeah, that's helpful context.
1343.66s:  Now, when you look at the movement post drop, so moving from the fifth until essentially today,
1352.06s:  what do you notice between the indices? Does anything stick out to you there?
1357.10s:  Yeah, so we bottomed, VIX hit was 65, so it was a clear that at least in the short term,
1364.38s:  it was extreme. Either we were going to rebound or we were going to crash. So I mean, I think
1368.94s:  Bank of Japan backed off, which was the like the crisis of that moment. So I think, you know,
1373.90s:  we started our rebound today. I think it was a little bit more of surprising that we are so strong.
1378.30s:  Today, I think it's because PPI was low and they're expecting low CPIs or result tomorrow.
1383.10s:  And again, I think so many people got like sold out of that drop. There's just that kind of
1387.66s:  recovery coming back up. So I think it's just the normal mechanics. It's really hard to tell if
1393.42s:  if the market isn't like still embarking on a deeper correction because of a weakening
1396.78s:  economy, which I think it is, I think the economy is weakening and the feds behind the curve.
1400.46s:  If you look at like the federal funds rate and two-year yield, they're like they're always late.
1404.70s:  So I think they're late again. So just kind of buying off, you know, it's like just falling
1409.98s:  prey to that formal on the way back up. Like I would at least want to see a bit of a retest,
1414.70s:  like coming down two, three days. Like how do you react when some selling pressure coming comes
1418.94s:  back in? So this is kind of the vacuum back up because we had the vacuum down. And I think now the
1423.82s:  next few days are going to be telling maybe we get a V recovery straight to the highs.
1428.06s:  That's happened historically, but it's very rare. It's very rare. If you go and study every drop
1433.74s:  that's like an excessive 10%, it's very rare. You don't at least have, even COVID, like you
1439.66s:  bottomed hard, you ran up for three, four, five days and you had a little bit of a higher low.
1443.66s:  And then you went and that was the fed like throwing everything it could at the market.
1447.98s:  So to have a real complete V to all time highs, very, very rare. So we'll see I, I think the
1453.58s:  market had the easy rebound. Like I said, because of that vacuum and the next coming next few days
1459.26s:  going to be important. What do you make of the relationship between large cap and small cap?
1463.82s:  Now that's one thing I found interesting. It seems like large cap has been exhibiting very
1468.46s:  similar to what you're talking about. This almost parabolic now rise back up. Whereas it seems
1473.10s:  like small cap is already started consolidating. Do you make anything there? I feel like, you know,
1478.46s:  the same trade that was going on earlier was put on again. Like I think, especially if you look at
1482.78s:  semis, like semis, I mean, the semi conductor index, I think felt 30% from its highs into the drop
1488.30s:  early August. So again, funds that were blown out or those that were in blow and they had, it's like,
1492.46s:  hey, let's put that trade back on again. You know, like, like, positions back to normal. So I think
1495.98s:  you're just seeing a little bit of that trade put back on pretty clear. It's like three or four days
1500.06s:  where large caps, like easily outperform small caps. But again, looking at the charts, even of the
1506.46s:  semis and like the larger players, this is still that normal little bounce off the bottom.
1510.78s:  So running into their averages, very, every, I never seen a bear market where you didn't have
1515.26s:  at least bear market rallies. So it's really become that uptrend. You learn more about the pullbacks
1519.90s:  and an uptrend than you do on the rally. So waiting to really see if we get two or three days,
1523.50s:  four days correction. Do we just kind of flop over hard or is it, is it bought into by funds?
1529.98s:  Yeah, that's a really interesting point. What did you make of the by volume on the fifth is an
1536.38s:  indicator of the way they might think about that? Because I was actually a little surprised
1540.46s:  to see how strong the buying started to come in on the fifth when it just started to take a bite.
1545.34s:  Do you think that that's informative whatsoever about what they might do if it gets back down
1550.06s:  to that level again? Or do you think it's a completely new problem set at that point?
1555.58s:  I think, like, I mean, I've seen enough of these these panics enough, like for sure,
1559.26s:  some phone calls went off and, you know, the people in the know were told like, okay, okay,
1563.02s:  bankage of pans in a back off. They're not going to keep raising rates. Don't worry about it.
1566.86s:  We're not going to crash. We'll support more. So someone got the phone calls. Like, I think
1571.02s:  that Monday morning to like alleviate like panic. And so you saw that like even I bought, like,
1575.58s:  I was lucky. I had had no positions going into where I had just like one but it's like utility.
1579.66s:  It was was like untouched. And so I mean, I did a little bit of buying that morning. But like,
1585.42s:  once you get that like initial burst off of the bottom, it's like, okay, where do we go from here?
1589.90s:  So I kind of like eased out a little bit out of things. And and now it's waiting to see how we
1594.38s:  consolidate. It just so happens that we end up going back a little more parabolic. But again,
1597.66s:  I think it's because people are slamming on that same kind of large being long large semis,
1602.30s:  which what's strange about what's exacerbating the weirdness of this market is that sometimes people
1607.98s:  like latch onto a trade could be like, you know, other cycles oil was the hot trade or whatever.
1612.94s:  It just so happens that the stocks that are the hot trade now are like the biggest market cap stocks
1617.50s:  in the market. So if you're, you know, if you're ramming up these like seven eight stocks like broad
1621.74s:  common video and that's enough to move the whole market and then everyone kind of just in unison.
1626.86s:  So it's a it's a particularly odd market because the speculative names are the largest cap names,
1632.78s:  which is never usually the case. So it's going to be interesting to see what comes next.
1637.50s:  Yeah, that's a really interesting point. Honestly, one that I hadn't thought too much about the
1641.66s:  I mean, if you look back to early 90s, like when the internet was becoming a thing like IBM wasn't
1646.70s:  like the hot stock of the market, you know what I mean or like if you go back to like, you know,
1651.42s:  early 2000s, like it it wasn't, you know, I don't know, Exxon mobile that was the hot stock of the
1657.58s:  market going up and down like crazy. But like now that's what it is. I mean like Nvidia is maybe not
1661.82s:  the largest market cap anymore, but close enough and you know, up 7% one day down for like though that's
1667.18s:  kind of like the actually usually a small cap stock. So pretty wild. Right. Yeah. What do you think about
1673.66s:  the current positioning of things in the economy with respect to the perspective recession?
1680.46s:  I think we're slowing it. We just had home people come out this morning saying that the
1684.22s:  consumer's slowing. So I think your you know, Starbucks been having a hard time. You're seeing it
1687.74s:  a lot of different places and it makes sense. I mean, we went from zero to five and a half percent
1691.74s:  in a straight line. I think there was like that excess, you know, COVID savings lying around that's
1696.22s:  been fully worn off here. So I think we're clearly seeing the slowdown. That's why inflation's
1701.42s:  coming down. And you know, as investors, it's always easy to kind of like play one day, you know,
1706.30s:  quarterback for the Fed like all they should do this and do that. But if I was the Fed, I would rather
1712.62s:  be a little extra hawkish and see the market break down and see a small recession and see inflation
1717.50s:  ignite again. Like it's far easier to resuscitate like a small recession than to like re kind of anchor
1725.42s:  people expecting a lot of inflation. If that happens, you set off a decade of trouble. So
1730.94s:  it's like I get what Powell's doing. Like he's going to be it's always the kind of easy to play the
1734.70s:  blame game like, oh, they're going to put us into a recession. Like I think the US economy is far
1738.70s:  stronger than anyone would have expected with five and a half percent like federal funds, right? Like
1742.62s:  far stronger, which so I mean, I don't I don't see a big usually a big bear market comes around when
1749.58s:  something systemically breaks or you go into like a hard recession. Like I don't not really see that.
1754.46s:  I think this is like normal corrective stuff because it was like large caps got ahead of themselves.
1759.74s:  I think if we even correct a little bit longer and further, it's like we just set up like a really
1763.26s:  strong potential bull market. What I mean, think about it once once inflation gets re anchored at 2%
1769.74s:  you have like a new kind of massive productivity boost like with AI, which could be someone like
1774.06s:  the internet. We'll see how it develops whether it does or it doesn't. But markets are already
1779.18s:  generally strong. Economies are strong and the feds about to go to begin a rate cut cycle. So I
1784.54s:  mean, it's pretty it's pretty wild to have like all that going on. I mean, we don't know who's
1788.94s:  going to become president, but let's say it's it's Trump and he also that has more like tax cutting
1792.78s:  policies. So you'll get like, you know, stimulus from tax cuts. You'll get stimulus from fed
1797.34s:  rate cuts. You have maybe a potential AI productivity boom. So I mean, if all that work to come together,
1806.06s:  that shapes up for like a multi year like super bull market. I mean, there's a lot of variables there,
1810.94s:  but we'll see something to be really, you know, optimistic about I think.
1815.90s:  You mentioned being close to a rate cut cycle, which I agree with, right? We can kind of see
1821.26s:  that through the bond market. What do you think about small cap positioning right now, though,
1826.14s:  in relation to that? I think there's going to be a catch up move. You know, it's it's awful because
1832.94s:  I think small caps got hammered twofold, which is frustrating for people because the inflation,
1837.66s:  you know, they didn't have good pricing power. And now recession hits them first before. I mean,
1842.30s:  you're more likely to not go to your local store than not get an iPhone. So they kind of got hit
1846.94s:  both sides. So I think it's just a lead to basically everyone being out of small caps, even midcaps.
1852.46s:  I mean, never we say small, even mid. I mean, this has really been just a large cap game has been
1856.78s:  where like all the heat has been. So that's why I think that all these like I said, things like
1861.26s:  rate cuts, things like rate cut cycle, all this is going to benefit. I think everyone outside,
1866.94s:  I mean, large cap is one now, but on a relative basis, I would imagine that once we turn the corner,
1872.30s:  mid and small, they're going to have like some epic, epic runs that we haven't seen in a long time,
1877.10s:  I think. That was honestly my assessment as well, but it's also part of my current confusion,
1883.90s:  because I think it's a big part of what we saw that original run in small caps in that it seemed
1890.62s:  like we thought we were on the cost of these rate cuts and kind of starting a front run that move.
1897.66s:  And then what surprises me now, though, is that it seems like the probability of a rate cut is even
1902.94s:  higher in small caps or kind of just lay in there. I haven't been really able to make heads or tails of
1908.54s:  that yet. Sometimes it's just a timing thing. You know, like I've noticed that in my career. So
1913.26s:  like sometimes I've missed out on some epic opportunities, because I was super long. Like,
1917.50s:  it doesn't happen for like one month, two months. And you say, oh, maybe I'm just like wrong about
1921.26s:  that idea, but then it's like six months later, it kicks off. You know, so sometimes I like,
1926.14s:  I've just noticed, like I've just, if I feel I have a good story, like it's always practice risk
1929.98s:  management first, like I'd rather be wrong five times under perform, but my capital is intact.
1934.22s:  Like I really don't care. But then after one, if it is right, then you nail it. But then
1938.86s:  some it's really just actually going back to reminisces to stock operator. There's like a cool story
1942.78s:  he talks about where like he finally learns like how to short and all this kind of stuff and he gets
1947.26s:  his right positioning. He's like, I got everything right, but I didn't realize, you know, I saw this big
1951.98s:  heap of gold. There was like a wheelbarrow at a shovel help yourself. I didn't realize there was a
1955.82s:  time lock. And I ran too fast. I fell. I tripped and I missed all the gold and I ended up losing money.
1960.54s:  So like that time element, and just sometimes I think as traders, we can see better into the future
1967.10s:  than others. But then after we kind of get ahead of the actual market itself. So sometimes it's just
1971.02s:  patience, I think. Yeah, I think that makes sense to it's funny when you were talking about the timing
1976.38s:  element because I think you just about perfectly described the Russell trade that I had on the
1981.50s:  beginning of the year that just did nothing for two months. And I was just like, all right, man,
1986.06s:  I guess I'm just the village idiot. Okay. So then I moved on to something else, but I set a bunch
1990.86s:  of alerts because I was just like, I just know that this, I just know this is going to pop at some point.
1999.10s:  So I'm going to get it all in five days and you weren't positioned yet. I was actually super stoked
2003.90s:  because as soon as it made that first gap up, I missed the like the first half of that first days
2009.90s:  gap up. I missed that gap up. But from there, as soon as I saw that, I was just like, load the boats,
2015.18s:  bro, I just folded everything into it. And then I kind of just trend followed it down a little bit.
2021.74s:  I actually have a video coming out soon talking about more specifically the strategy I used a ratio
2025.82s:  called diagonal. And I use that trade as the vector just because it's a recent one that was kind
2030.38s:  of entertaining because I get to talk about how dumb I was at the beginning of it. But yeah, I
2035.90s:  was like, I was sitting there. I was just like, I don't know if I'm pissed off right now because it
2040.46s:  took so long to happen. But then it literally is essentially made the years worth of moves in like
2047.02s:  six days. So how mad do I get to be? And I haven't really figured that out yet. I'm still
2052.78s:  pretty pissed off though because in the beginning, I was just looking left looking right and I was just
2057.58s:  like, what's happening? What's smoke? Do something. Well, if you think that makes you upset. I had
2063.82s:  position SMCI. So this year does one of the best. So last year at, let me look at my chart here.
2069.74s:  So from like June, it was a 200. I had like, I had built a big portfolio. Like I think I was like
2075.34s:  like a 40, 50% position in SMCI portfolio from like 200 up to like 340. And then earnings were
2083.66s:  sour or kind of gaped down. So I got out of it with like, you know, some profit, but less profit.
2087.98s:  And like I'm watching and there was so many failed attempts. And all of a sudden, like January,
2092.54s:  it's like lagging and really keep you up at the market. And all of a sudden from 300,
2095.82s:  you're 1200 is like the trade of the year. I'm like, use anyways. That was like again, being a little
2101.66s:  bit early sometimes. And that's just and how to have that same position would have been like, wow,
2105.50s:  like epic year again. Yeah, yeah. What can you do? That's exactly how she goes. Well, and you also
2111.50s:  know exactly what would have happened if you stayed in the trade, you personally would have crashed
2116.70s:  SMCI or whatever reason. If you had stayed in that trade, SMCI wouldn't have made that move.
2121.90s:  Something terrible would have happened. And it would have sounded like shit, I should have got out.
2128.30s:  I've learned to reconcile that the market is one of the only forces I've ever met that can make
2133.34s:  two people with opposing positions simultaneously wrong. And there has a reason. As a slick way of
2139.26s:  doing it too, because you did something different, but we both lost how? I don't know how anyone
2145.50s:  who's traded long enough can be a getistical. I don't know. To me, it's impossible. It's like,
2151.10s:  if you have an ego after trading for like five, 10 years plus, wow, there's something special about
2156.70s:  every single person I know has traded for a living is a very like centered person like, okay,
2161.82s:  that's that's what the market gave me and like just move on, you know, like it just it'll grind you
2166.54s:  into the ground if you let it. So I literally couldn't agree with you more. There's actually a saying
2171.82s:  that I use with people at home like, do you want to be right or do you want to make money? And
2176.78s:  I know there was some people who really like, you know, the skill set of being able to be right.
2181.50s:  Actually, Jim Ropel is wonderful. I asked him that question. He's like, he's like, no, I want to be
2185.18s:  right. And I was just like, okay, that's totally fair, man. Because like some people really,
2189.90s:  really like that process. And in that process, they get to make money. But for me specifically,
2194.94s:  and I think for a lot of people that have egos, it's really important, at least for me to always put
2201.26s:  like first things first, which is I could be completely wrong in make money. All right,
2206.54s:  can be completely right and lose money. But the important part is figuring out a system to
2210.78s:  interface with the market and make money in the long run, which is the whole whole kit and
2214.38s:  caboodle for me at least. I think I still would. Sorry. No, I'll say like I found that markets go
2221.66s:  through like repetitive three, four month cycles. Like every three, four months, like the whole,
2225.66s:  you get a new wave and new winners come out. So like, you know, I've been trading professionally since
2230.78s:  2008. I started trading 2003, 2004. Like I've seen these cycles so many times. And sometimes you get
2237.26s:  them so like I've had like some really epic runs in three, four months, like, you know, multi hundred
2242.46s:  percent returns. And other times it's like your lag for 12 months is 18 months where you just like,
2247.58s:  you're making a bit, but you just, you just can't get it to connect. So like, when you go to that
2251.98s:  cycle multiple times, you just realize like, okay, it's one of those cycles and you just have to
2255.34s:  learn to be centered and not like blame yourself or not go off and change everything and just stay
2260.54s:  centered and stay focused because like it's just this recurring cycle of being sometimes super
2264.54s:  right. But then other times just not getting it. So well, you also said something there that I think
2268.78s:  is really important because I find trading in general is like the, the art of balance. You got
2274.46s:  to balance so many things. And to your point right there, like if you miss time a cycle,
2279.98s:  there's, you have to have enough self scrutiny to look at what you did and make sure that you did
2286.94s:  programmatically what made sense. But to your point, sometimes the market is just going to throw
2293.26s:  something else. And I'm actually curious how you think about solving that dichotomy because you
2299.66s:  can't put your hands up and just be like, oh, the market is just doing whatever the market does
2303.42s:  and not hold yourself accountable. But you also can't punish yourself into the dirt because if you do
2307.90s:  that, the market to your point will continue to humble you. Do you have any thoughts about like how
2312.54s:  to reconcile those two things as a trader? So it's funny. You speak of Jim Ropel. So I, you know,
2317.34s:  I talk with Jim sometimes and he's super nice guy. And there's something I kind of stole from him.
2322.14s:  He calls him guardrails, you know, like things that you just want to make sure you don't make like a
2326.46s:  serious mistake. So like what I've, I've tried to do like cycle after cycle is like, what was the
2332.38s:  biggest mistake that caused like like, like, there's always going to be small mistakes, but those can
2336.46s:  be watched away. Like, were there any like, like more serious mistakes? And so I kind of like trying
2342.70s:  line up different rules to be those guardrails to not make them again, you know? So like, for example,
2348.70s:  like looking back at the past, like, you know, year and a half, I always focus on small midgaps.
2353.90s:  That's always just where all the actions always been. So it's like, I saw Nvidia. I saw that I had
2357.50s:  relative strength that had earnings and sales and all that kind of stuff, but just wasn't a focus of
2361.26s:  mind, you know? So because I always figured like, you know, it's already a trillion dollar company.
2364.86s:  You're really going to triple from here in six months. Well, yeah, apparently you want. So, but,
2369.66s:  no, like the bingo cards. Yeah, exactly. You know, but again, like so it's like you have the rules of like
2376.86s:  relative strength will all like if you if a stock won't go down when the market is down, like last
2382.14s:  to me, like looking back at a video in March of 2023 when there was that like banking crisis
2386.86s:  that everyone forgot about happened for like a couple of months. When the markets all kind of sold
2391.90s:  off and like Nvidia was still like climbing and either climbing or just going dead sideways,
2397.66s:  like that was you don't need to know the news. You almost don't even know to know, you need to know
2400.94s:  earnings and sales. If the market's going to drop 10% and you're like at least a mid cap or higher.
2405.66s:  So you're not just like a small cap story. If you won't fall when the market's falling 10 or 15%
2411.74s:  somebody does not want to sell you or somebody wants to buy every single share they can get. So
2416.86s:  to me, it's like again, for this past cycle, looking at it, you know, I always put a lot of weight on
2420.86s:  the net highs and it lows, but I think that the most important factor for me above all,
2425.74s:  no matter how each cycle as I study things, that relative strength, like and that comes through
2430.30s:  in the corrections. Like even now we had this correction, everyone's going to go back and look at
2434.38s:  let's say micron or SMCI that were hot last cycle, but those are not the ones that held up well in
2439.74s:  this cycle the same way. There's new names. There's new things going on. So again, like
2444.06s:  why chase micron that's fallen 30, 40% when something like Palantir is already back at 52 week highs
2450.30s:  and barely budge during like the market sell off. So it's like every cycle again, you get that
2454.06s:  opportunity and have those guard rails. So you don't make that same kind of mistake you made on
2458.30s:  a prior cycle. Eventually, as long as you manage risk, you're going to kill it then one of the cycles
2462.54s:  and do great. Yeah, that's awesome. I love that. What a great way to look at it. When you look at
2468.14s:  the market behavior this year, one of the things I like to do is just try to decouple different
2473.18s:  inputs on the markets and just try to assess the overall impact. It's just kind of general curiosity
2477.98s:  for me. And the election part of this year is weird because there's a lot of other things going on.
2485.74s:  And the election has its own personality and the impact that that can have, especially with the
2491.90s:  latest change in candidacy. It looks like Kamala, it will be the democratic nominee when everybody
2497.74s:  is originally expecting Biden until pretty recently. So when you look at this kind of election
2503.10s:  year, how do you think that that impacts markets broadly? Because to me, it's competing with
2510.30s:  interest rates, kind of other things at the same time.
2515.02s:  Yeah, and this is an important one because it's not like Canadian politics, it doesn't matter,
2519.98s:  right? But you know, but like I'll tie, especially outside Canada, it doesn't really matter.
2525.18s:  But this cycle, the view of the two people, Trump versus Kamala,
2531.26s:  it's dramatic differences in what their view is for the economy and what the impact will be.
2538.78s:  I mean, I try and even with clients be politically neutral, but there's one thing to me that's not
2543.50s:  neutral. It's just like economic outcomes. I'm a free market person, low taxes person, free
2550.62s:  competition, no monopolies. And that's what leads to the long-term success of countries and nations.
2556.86s:  So for a moment to look at Trump had kind of a sure victory, whether you love him or not,
2562.46s:  that's a net positive for the economy and for markets. In Kamala, where
2569.82s:  news is funny, no one really seemed to like her six months ago or even ever see her. And now,
2574.14s:  suddenly, it's like, she's supposed to be the favorite, this favorite candidate almost at an overnight.
2578.78s:  But her economic views, which I'm not even very sure of, from what I understand, her father was
2585.42s:  even like a Marxist professor. So she's always, she's always been kind of on the very, very left side
2590.06s:  of the spectrum, even how she's voted and stuff. So those are all policies that are negatives.
2594.06s:  And I think sometimes people don't even realize how fast negative economic policies can impact
2600.30s:  the country. Like we have a left leaning person here, true to one Canada. And from when
2607.50s:  since he took election, like we're like the lowest, you know, productivity growing country in the G7,
2613.10s:  like we've the spread between US growth and productivity in Canadian growth, growth of productivity
2618.46s:  is like widened, I think, to near like historic levels. Like it makes a, it may not be in three months,
2623.50s:  but fast forward four or five, seven, eight years. And you can have some really dramatic changes to
2628.86s:  an economy for like, for the worse. So I think it makes a big impact. And I think when,
2633.50s:  until markets figure out which way it's going to go, there's going to be some flip flopping back
2636.62s:  and forth. But ultimately, I think will be a big, big net positive if Trump was elected. Or at
2641.66s:  least if his economic, you know, ideas come to fruition over Kamala's. And how do you think the
2649.10s:  market is perceiving those two outcomes right now? Because one of the things I've been looking at
2655.66s:  from the options market is just the positioning in the options chains right around the election. And
2660.30s:  there's probably what you would imagine. I see it most years with an election is just a lot of
2664.22s:  hedging. There's a lot, a lot of relatively long term hedges being put on, which it's been slightly
2670.38s:  anomalous this year is that they started going on earlier than I typically would expect to see them.
2674.94s:  But do you think that there is any positioning within the market kind of like in a holding pattern
2681.10s:  until we get closer to seeing what that's actually going to look like or now?
2685.26s:  Yeah, I think so. And like I said, you know, there's those multiple tailwinds that are coming.
2690.78s:  And you know, the Trump one, you know, or those economic policies is a wild card. And I mean,
2696.46s:  if you have like, let's say a fed cutting cycle coming in or even let's say a productivity boom,
2701.42s:  but then if you have someone who's who puts up more regulation or as more like really poor fiscal
2706.62s:  spending, at least to inflation that prevents the rate cut like there's there's bad like, you know,
2711.34s:  fiscal policies that can ruin these other tailwinds that are are building right now. So
2716.46s:  it's a big it's a big wild card. And so I think part of part of the last leg up was I think a little
2723.50s:  bit of excitement over like Trump leading in polls. You saw like crypto getting, you know, a bit of a
2728.30s:  boost as even like he's kind of leaning more positively there. And so then I think just the massive
2732.38s:  positioning and then everything also Kamala kind of coming through and like raising kind of odds
2736.14s:  of her waiting the presidency. I think that also kind of weighed on the market drop. So just kind of
2740.38s:  like a little perfect storm that hit like late July, early August with Japan and all this kind of
2744.38s:  stuff at once. So I think definitely it's going to be it's going to make things wild the next few
2749.42s:  months. And I don't I don't know which way it's going to turn out. So it's going to be interesting.
2753.50s:  Yeah. And I know we're coming up on time. I don't want to hold you too late. But
2758.54s:  a follow on to that though. Then is how do you personally think about approaching markets
2763.98s:  then leading it to the event? Because like you're talking about, because I agree with you,
2767.34s:  like to me, it seems like the outcome of the election, whichever way it goes, it will mean
2773.50s:  something for markets. So for me, I, well, I mostly trade shorter term anyways, to be honest.
2779.74s:  Like let's just keep it up a buck here. You boy, it's like if it's a three week trade,
2784.94s:  that's an eternity. That is like I am geriatric at that point. I am yeah, I mean, just what I don't
2791.10s:  even know what to do with all that time. So the vast majority of my stuff is two weeks maybe.
2796.62s:  So for me, the general game plan I'm using is just kind of honestly like trading the general book
2802.46s:  leading into, but I am actually avoiding more thematic positions that I typically would put on.
2807.82s:  Like one of my favorite things to trade is just general positive drift in the market. Super simple
2812.22s:  trade, not much goes into it, size it down, use options, just say LaVie and come back to it in six
2818.86s:  months. Now I don't have that on. And part of it is because the recent market activity, but also
2825.10s:  because I have some reservations about how this could go. So in your opinion, how do you set yourself
2833.98s:  up leading into the election, understanding that it can have a pretty big impact?
2841.10s:  It's hard. It's one of those things like, you know, month to month week to week is all this
2844.22s:  this macroeconomic data. So you have to kind of like separate your views and even like some
2849.34s:  stuff we're talking about is longer term. Like let's say, let's say, it's a like and she doesn't
2852.78s:  have great economic policies. Like, you know, at the same time, like you want to avoid like this
2857.02s:  concern is not going to be this overnight. Like, oh, she's going to trash the economy. And like,
2860.78s:  I just think, you know, she's going to be more of the policies we have, which will generally
2864.94s:  favor larger companies way a little more like in terms of smaller companies and all that kind of stuff.
2869.18s:  So like, I don't think we'd have a, I mean, I think though of Trump, we're to get elected. He's
2872.94s:  like a faster moving kind of guy. He wants to like implement things quicker and he's got like,
2878.30s:  and what he would implement would be quite a change from the current. So I think if he would come
2883.02s:  and be kind of more upside quicker, but I think if Kamala, like, ends up winning, I think it's just
2889.34s:  a little more status quo. We just want to continue to watch. I see.
2891.74s:  I'm just doing all for us. So like, if anything, that may, which is I think good for the US in
2896.38s:  a sense, you have almost like an asymmetry where I don't think she would be terrible. Right.
2900.22s:  Or policies immediately longer term depends on what she would do. But Trump, I think if you would
2905.82s:  win, would be kind of a pretty immediate like positive, I think, for markets. I see. Got it. Yeah.
2912.38s:  Last question before we sign off here, what are your favorite things that you're looking at right now?
2919.82s:  So like, like I mentioned before, I get excited. Like, I don't always catch every uptrend perfect,
2924.86s:  but I've never been caught in a big downtrend. Thankfully, you know, knock on wood, you know, so,
2929.42s:  again, I was cached up for this drop. So, and I was not that I was killing it before. So at
2934.86s:  least I, you know, I didn't kill it on the way up. I didn't get killed on the way down. But again,
2938.38s:  now is that great time where you can see who didn't fall in this market draw. And so I'm watching
2943.50s:  stocks. Like I said, I mentioned Palantir, which is, I think Palantir is really interesting because
2946.78s:  their growth is really picking up. If you look at their sales growth, not only are they're growing,
2951.02s:  but the rate of their revenue growth is accelerating, which is phenomenal. And they're on like key
2956.62s:  themes, like obviously AI, defense spending and all the rest. So they're really interesting.
2962.78s:  Then after we're looking at some other like the large caps, like meta is held in great. I think
2968.62s:  meta is someone where like data has become all the more valuable with AI and all the rest. So I
2974.22s:  think they're just going to find more and more tailwinds like monetize all of that and reach out to
2977.90s:  new people. So again, they held in very well. There's just a lot of great names that did not break
2982.78s:  down with this market environment. And a lot of them are midcaps. You know, there's things like
2986.06s:  Kava, which is the restaurant, Mediterranean restaurant group. There's just so many I can name.
2991.26s:  Like a service now is more large cap held in well. So it's just really keeping on all those stocks.
2997.26s:  I did not break down that are already trading at 52 week highs. Some of them with the market still
3001.50s:  quite a ways off. So they are like so they are all very, very being closely washed to me looking
3006.30s:  for some kind of consolidation. See what the market does after this initial bounce when it kind of
3010.46s:  corrects. But it has been very exciting because every time you have these corrections, those stocks
3015.82s:  that don't fall, then they'll become the epic winners for the next three to four months. But you
3020.46s:  need the market to participate. That's always that's always like that key thing. I always know which
3023.90s:  stocks will work, but you never quite know when that market will bottom. And until the market
3029.50s:  it's like it's that anchor on them. So you have to kind of still need to get that timing right.
3033.90s:  But I think there's some clear leaders that are really kind of coming through, which is nice to see.
3037.98s:  Yeah, that's awesome, man. What a great note to end on. Plus, I mean, we can also just shout out
3042.86s:  the fact that the prospect of getting timing right for you, Boise, about no. So I'll continue to
3047.74s:  mess up all the timing on all of those, even though you gave me the script. I'll still dork it all up.
3052.54s:  But dude, absolute pleasure always hanging out with me. I like I absolutely love having the
3057.74s:  opportunity to pick your brain, learn from you every single time I get to walk away with a few
3062.78s:  nuggets. So thanks for hanging out. I will definitely send a, you know, in the description below
3067.82s:  all the links to your website newsletter, which is great. Your ex profile, but is there anywhere else
3073.82s:  that you want to send people to? I'm also on YouTube. I try and increase posting frequency outside
3079.82s:  the summer. Summer gets a little bit, you know, I get a little bit slower sometimes, but you could
3083.74s:  also chat. Everyone's watching on YouTube. So if you look me up on YouTube, you'll find me too.
3087.90s:  Beautiful. Yeah, I'll tag you in this so that it'll pop up on your stuff too. So that they'll
3092.06s:  get get over to your channel. They definitely should. So thanks for hanging out. Thanks for hanging
3096.14s:  out. Everybody else being outlier. And we'll see you guys later.
