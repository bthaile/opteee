0.00s: What's up, everyone? Welcome back to the outlier podcast. I got my friend and friendly
5.82s: face, Matthew Caruso from Caruso insights. What's up, man? Welcome back.
9.44s: Yeah, I think it's driving me back Eric. It's always a pleasure.
12.08s: Absolutely. Pleasure. We're sitting there kind of BS in for a little bit about how I
16.36s: essentially just the ultimate failure and it's kind of fun to figure out what other ways
19.66s: I can mess things up. But it's always good to talk to people like you that are figuring
23.56s: it out. You just had a really awesome trip over to Europe. I mean, talk to us about that.
29.26s: What do you think? For me, life, markets, everything's all one puzzle that's all wrapped
35.38s: up. So now having two small boys, like I said, being able to show them the history in
38.86s: person and Italy and Rome. And there's just just a phenomenal get outside, get into mountains,
44.24s: exercise and physical conditioning too. It was just wonderful trip. Great way to also
48.76s: rest the mind and recharge the batteries. Just fantastic.
51.86s: Yeah. Now, what kind of stuff did your boys really enjoy doing? What did they gravitate
57.38s: to? So it's so we started off in the mountains and we did some like mountain biking and just
63.26s: like being a lot outside. So they just love like and that's amazing thing about kids.
66.82s: They just love that freedom. They just like be out there and just explore open pastures.
72.02s: Mountains was great. And so it was funny that there was like the two extremes that
74.98s: part and they enjoyed the beach and pool like period, but they also just like love Rome
79.02s: and the history. And so for me as a history lover, it's great. Like I was saying, show
82.94s: them like, Hey, like you see that balcony there? Like that's then you show them on your
85.82s: phone. That's where Mussolini was, you know, whipping up the crowds and all that like before,
90.06s: like World War II kicked off. And like even at like six years old, they're like amazed.
94.14s: And even for me, it kind of gives me chills to see it all like in the same place. So it's
97.50s: pretty awesome. It's also a good reminder like markets, everything and like things repeat
100.78s: and what to be aware of. So it was awesome.
103.58s: Well, and one of the cool things that you were telling me right before we started talking
107.22s: is that how your what one of your sons was like really starting to like pick up the gravity
112.86s: of things. And like I just feel like that's got to be so cool to be able to experience them
117.98s: experiencing that that's got to be just so fun for you. Yeah, like just for them to see how
125.34s: like the world, you know, they still see things very black and white, but to see them start
128.38s: to like connect the dots of how everything and how the world functions and you know, they grow
133.02s: up in a nice environment and then to see like, Oh, there could be bad actors out there and
137.26s: the repercussions and all that. So it's amazing to see it kind of almost relearn it through
141.90s: someone else's eyes again. It's it's a great experience. So cool. So cool. Dude, I love that.
146.62s: So one of the things I like to ask traders specifically that do stuff like that though is how do
151.58s: you set your portfolio when you go on vacation mode? Because funny enough, I was telling you,
155.90s: I was just in Alaska. And I had to go through a similar process that I always find interesting
161.42s: to try to describe to people, but as you know, I love learning your approach to stuff. So what do you
165.66s: do with your portfolio before he bounced? You know, it's I feel like I'm cursed. If I go with a
170.38s: lot of positions like the market tanks, if I go with no positions, the market rips. So it's like
174.38s: you kind of been trouble. But you know, like I learned even on my honeymoon, I ended up spending
178.30s: way more money on losses than I did on my honeymoon because I became an attentive and positions
182.14s: won against me. So I I never fully disconnect because I I find even being completely away for
187.26s: three weeks, you lose that touch and that feel. So I always have a couple of things definitely watch
192.38s: every day, but just really reduce size. And I just I make sure that I can at least check market
197.66s: open. So I can put in stop orders if need be. And then I can go on my own. But you know, having like
202.22s: 30% exposure is not the same as having 120% exposure. So at least if you're you have light positioning
208.14s: and use at least you're watching you get the best of both worlds. You get to have like a a mind
212.86s: that's not overly kind of way down by markets. And at the same time, you keep your kind of feel
217.10s: with the market. Yeah, that's awesome. Do you find any benefit from not being as over the portfolio?
224.30s: I know for me sometimes, especially if I'm running more programmatic style trade. So definitely
229.34s: a little bit different than what you're doing. But if I'm like trying to churn out risk premiums,
234.14s: a big part of that is just occurrences. And sometimes it is not fun watching one of those occurrences
239.42s: burn into a fiery flame. And you're just like, okay, I guess I guess I should watch this. And at
244.62s: least for me, I find it easier. Cause it's just like I put the stuff on, put on the stops as I need them.
251.34s: And then I just check at the end of the day. I'm just like, how'd I go? What would we do? And
254.70s: it's like, okay, I lost on all of these terrible, but I don't care. Cause I'm going to go do this
259.42s: other really cool thing. Is there any element of that for you? Or is it mostly because I know you
263.66s: trade very differently and typically very concentrated. So it sounds like sizing down as a big part of how
269.10s: you set up like your day to day. But do you find any benefit from detaching a little bit more?
276.30s: I do, you know, every so often, like every like several months or at least like once a year,
282.94s: I try and take like a really step back and like question like the different elements of the
286.38s: approach. And like one, like I was a like market maker, like I lived markets, like I'd have like
291.26s: hundreds hundreds of trades a day, you know, and and then even as you gravitate to like more
295.34s: but position trading, like that stays in you, you know, so like so being able to step away,
300.78s: it's like, okay, can I can I do this? Like how much of my time is actually wasted or how much is
305.74s: is like working against me staring at the screens versus just losing stop orders? Because I
309.82s: you know, I have a lot of like clients and stuff that where they, you know, everything is just
312.86s: functioned off of like, you know, trigger points and that. So I mean, it works for them, but then I
316.94s: I tend to just sit in front of the screen all day and watch price action. It's like, hey,
320.54s: is that actually helping or working against me? So like when you're your market making,
324.62s: obviously it's critical, but like in this environment, I mean, sometimes you'll cash that extra
329.34s: opportunity, but you got to weigh that against like, does it, you know, pull on your impulses to
333.26s: put on a trade you should end? I mean, we're all human. You still do kind of make those those
336.94s: impulse decisions sometimes. So it's nice to kind of like question like, hey, if I'm really
341.02s: away from the screens, you know, does it help or does it make it worse and what's the impact on?
346.14s: Like for me, touch and feels important. It's like I try and quantify as much as I can, make things
350.54s: as black and white as possible, but there's always a little bit of that like that innate gut feeling
354.78s: where like even if your your system tells you to be long, like you want to attack it like with like
360.14s: the full aggressive posturing of your system, or do you want to like make it a little more relaxed?
365.02s: I find that confidence comes from that feel. So it's trying to kind of manage, manage both.
370.06s: Yeah, it sounds a lot like from Malcolm Gladwell's Blink and I think he's the right author for that book.
377.74s: There's a book called Blink and it's very much about subconscious processing and priming.
383.02s: So when you talk about that idea of like this touch and like the feel of the markets,
389.34s: it's funny because when you talk to people that don't really understand it, it's like very esoteric,
393.26s: it kind of just sounds whimsical like nothing. But then when you're actually like a practitioner of it,
398.78s: you get like I literally know exactly what you're talking about because I actually think it's a
404.70s: bigger part of what a lot of traders do, especially more discretionary traders that are not,
409.74s: you know, just algorithmic in nature. So when you're taking a step back in your analyzing what
415.66s: you're doing, you're kind of seeing like this process that I'm following, value-ad versus value-not-ad,
420.86s: do you have any examples of something that when you're looking at it, you realize that this is not
425.74s: actually tremendous value-ad? Yeah, you know, it's sometimes it's the merging of, you're trying to
433.34s: merge like processes in your mind. So it's like there's certain tools and or applications that
438.70s: work well with how it's day trading. And so the impulse will still come out. Like you can see that
443.58s: in the short term, I can say it goes as a short term opportunity. But then after when you're
446.94s: positioning or what like it throws off a larger strategy, let's say you're not right about that
451.50s: move, then it affects your average cost. And so like sometimes, you know, even though it looks like
456.30s: a good setup in the short term, trying to like through impulse kind of merge two different
461.58s: approaches kind of work against you. But you know, but everything like you kind of touch on,
466.22s: it came more to the forefront for me. I was at one point, I got really deep into like kind of
470.62s: redalue when everything he did and like what he calls like kind of the golden system about how he
476.78s: manages risks with diversification, like which is very different from how I approach things.
480.54s: But I saw in several interviews where he like they asked him like what do you attribute your success to?
485.98s: Like in different interviews, different times, he's like meditation. For me, it's like I agree,
490.38s: it's like meditation. It was like the most unexpected answer I could have expected, you know, but
495.58s: I think as you go on with time as a trader, especially when you go through periods of drawdown,
498.94s: like when you're fresh, you're new, it's like let's go, let's go, let's go. And but then when you kind
502.38s: of get go through like the meat grinder a little bit, like you realize how like keeping your mind centered
507.02s: and focus is so that's almost the difference between those who end up succeeding and those are just
510.78s: drop off eventually. Yeah, it will and it's funny when you, you know, chuckle about the responsive
517.66s: meditation because one of the things that I find with practitioners that get good at pretty much
524.14s: anything they're doing over the long run, they essentially just boil things down into like
529.82s: these really seemingly simple things, but there are things that are done really well.
535.34s: I always get a kick out of that, like even in the military, there's a bunch of times that you
539.10s: would talk to dudes about the way that they thought about this process. And the process itself can be
545.66s: insanely complex, like markets, but then they'll literally just boil it down to slow as smooth,
552.14s: smooth as fast. Like, what does that even mean? Like, what does that mean? What do I do with that?
558.86s: And it's really eye opening though. And I think it's important for people to hear those kinds of
563.26s: messages because it goes back to what I, what Leonardo da Vinci, I think he said, um, simplicity is
570.46s: the ultimate form of sophistication. And I love that line because I notice people that get really
576.22s: good at trading or other things. They're really good at breaking things down into their core concepts,
581.98s: simple and doing them really well, really, really well. So that's an interesting one to hear from
588.22s: your perspective though, because I like the way that you're kind of talking about like balancing those
592.30s: two parts, those two systems in the mind. Um, when you're on your vacation, it sounds like you're
599.98s: like me where I still absolutely look at markets. And for me, it's very rarely because like,
606.38s: I'm like a crack head and I'm like, oh, I just got to get a peak. Like, it's just because much like
611.10s: you, I love markets. It's, I enjoy them. So when you're looking at markets though in a
619.10s: pair down sense, what are the really key things that you're focusing on? Like if you were to give
623.66s: somebody a cliff notes version of if they're going on a trip and they're asking you like, hey, Matt,
629.26s: you know, what are some good things I should look at to be super efficient when I'm looking at
633.02s: markets? Was that look like, you know, it's, so it's fine that there's a, I'm sure you know,
637.02s: the book Reminus is a stock operator. There's so many little things you can pull from that book.
642.06s: But I remember there was one chapter where he was talking about like a great trader and he would
646.30s: like, pace back and forth across the room, but like with the predictable like, like, tempo,
650.06s: like I think like every 30 minutes he'd go to the ticker tape and check a quote. And like part of
654.30s: the story was like, he basically eventually let us all know that by checking like at a regular
658.30s: interval, even if it's every hour or every two hours, you get a sense for how markets are reacting
662.94s: over those intervals. So instead of checking like after five minutes after four hours and after two
666.86s: minutes, like by having kind of like a more like systematic approach, you get a sense of like, let's
671.50s: say you check the first half hour of the day, you know, pretty much like volume price action,
675.66s: what goes on in the first half hour. So like I try even on vacation, have kind of like a different
681.26s: times that I'll regularly check. And also I just check for like the outlier moves, like the outlier
686.30s: podcast. So basically, no, who are like, especially if it's summertime, like I try and ignore all
692.46s: the like, just the stocks of 1% down 1%, like it's already kind of dramatic outperformance by stocks,
697.74s: like and beyond one day. So for up today is your fall through the next day or is it just like summer
701.90s: chop, summer churn. So just trying to try to try to at least like decipher if there's any sustainable
707.66s: trends or if it's just noise, like that's just kind of just trying to like get, you know, I have less
711.50s: times, you want to focus on like what's the signal coming from the market? Got it. Yeah, I love
716.54s: that. So then when you're looking at the rest of your portfolio, though, like you're talking about
721.50s: you size down a lot, are you still ready to jump at opportunities if you see them? Or is it just
728.38s: kind of monitoring things, keeping a pulse, and then you'll really get back to things when you get
732.14s: back at the office? I'll do like a little bit like I just try and avoid getting fully invested,
737.82s: because then like your mind is distracted. You could be with the kids on a mountain top,
742.46s: and you know, a dad come and play, and then you're like, you're glued to your phone, which,
746.06s: especially if like, you know, of course the way it is the next day, the markets are going to open
749.02s: up down and you're going to have to like worry about who's getting stopped out and you're on your
752.30s: phone and the connection maybe is not great. So to a certain extent, at least if you're like 50%
757.26s: invested, you know, there's only so much pain that can come from a mistake. So I still try and like
762.14s: keep myself on the reduced side of things, just in case something goes awry, you don't have
767.50s: access or whatever happens. Yeah, yeah, makes a ton of sense. So talk to me a little bit about your
773.58s: perception of what the market's done so far this year. And actually one of the things I want to
778.38s: highlight specifically and get your take on was the series of moves essentially that started from
784.86s: the first of August, then over the second and then the fifth. Like those three days specifically,
791.82s: were really interesting to me personally, but I'm curious if they were anything special to you,
797.26s: or just what you made of that move there. So this year, it's a really interesting year because
803.66s: when we spoke about our own past podcasts together, like I always fall like to fall like
808.94s: the net highs, like number of stocks making 52 week highs versus 52 week lows. And that hasn't
813.34s: been very accurate this year. It's been very wonky because what we're going through, like,
819.42s: bouts of inflation messes up the normal mechanics of markets. Like that's why like you saw like in the
824.70s: past couple of years, like, you know, the like the 60, 40 portfolios all kind of blew up because
829.82s: bonds. So so inflation breaks the regular like functioning of the market. The market still function,
835.18s: but the regular relationships go in opposite directions. And so I think coming off the bottom,
841.18s: we're starting to kind of get that rebound once inflation peaked even though the Fed had
845.10s: and cut rates and all that yet. But we entered in this thing like basically like a
848.62s: cable recovery, like they're saying, there's a few stocks are doing really great, but then there's
851.74s: a lot of stocks are not doing well, like not doing great at all, which not that every cycle everyone's
856.70s: doing fantastic, but like the disparity between the few and the many has been larger than any kind
862.54s: of normal cycle in recent in the recent past. So that's been exacerbated with AI and how large
868.06s: caps have led. And again, if you go back historically, if you look at like each year, who's like like the
873.66s: the biggest two or three stocks at the S&P 500, those don't tend to be the market leaders that year
879.10s: because they're so big, they're so kind of cumbersome. They'll go up with the market, but they're not
882.38s: going to lead. So this combination of like the AI push and like inflation causing this
887.42s: cable recovery is as make things very wonky this year. And so and you can see the how like when the
892.06s: small caps broke out like late July, you had a flurry of stocks making 50s and you guys and at the
897.66s: same time, the Nasdaq rolled over hard. So you have this very weird like small caps and large caps
902.70s: for almost like inversely correlated for a couple of weeks. So I think I think we're still kind
908.14s: of nursing the hangovers of all of the inflation and all the stimulus, which I think once we finally
913.18s: get inflation back down to line, again, normal nature of the market just it gets everyone to think
917.90s: that, hey, those tools don't work anymore or that that process doesn't work and then it goes back
921.98s: into line and everything works again. So I think the way the market's been reacting was like you
928.94s: mentioned those days specifically is I think the market's shifted from an inflation concern to
933.90s: more one of recession. And also I think a lot of the the AI hype that's really driven a big part
940.14s: of that like spread between the halves and have knots. It's kind of like show me the money now like
944.38s: people spent a lot of money on cap X. It's been a lot of like enormous market cap gains.
950.46s: Is that going to actually come to fruition? I think through earnings it hasn't been a good
953.26s: earnings season. So there's a bit of like concern with that. So I think there was a bit of that catch
958.06s: of move within the whole yen carry trade like was this giant bomb that like exacerbated everything
964.22s: and again we're still having these rebounding ramifications. So I'm hopeful that once we kind of
970.46s: get inflation back to normal, all the regular relationships are going to work and I can already see
975.18s: a lot of companies that are acting well that I think once we kind of get ourselves back into a
979.42s: healthy uptrend, we'll have like the very normal action of these nice mid cap stocks I'll performing
984.54s: in all the rest. There's like 62 questions I want to ask you at once. There is a ton of really
993.10s: cool details. I'm going to start with specifically the relationship between small caps and large cap.
999.58s: So a lot of what you were talking about in terms of just price behavior totally made sense.
1006.70s: Now what are your thoughts on the rationale behind the seemingly I wouldn't call it inversely
1014.62s: correlated personally but maybe not correlated or something but definitely a not normal correlation
1020.06s: that I feel very confident saying I just don't know what the numbers are off the top of my head.
1024.38s: But when you're looking at large and small, what do you make of the relationship there and how it
1030.06s: got so defiant? So I think again because of the K-shape recovery, it just made sense that
1037.98s: I think funds started to move to the safety of large companies who had pricing power and all the
1042.14s: rest and then I think AI just kind of fell into their lap. They were already kind of a long large cap
1047.10s: and like shying away from small cap for that reason. Then AI was just this big like, oh whoa,
1052.14s: right place, right time, let's take off running and they went for the liquidity.
1055.98s: But it's interesting because and again, it's how kind of like the current situation shapes the narrative
1061.42s: but people will say like now often like, oh, you know, funds prefer large cap stocks which is true.
1066.06s: But if you go back to like the cap M and all the pricing models, like a you know,
1070.94s: efficient market theory and all that kind of stuff, like at one point small caps were always out
1075.98s: performing large. And so they even had kind of like a like a like a like a like a like a how can I put it like
1085.18s: a specific like outlier situation where like oh, small caps will kind of outperform because
1090.30s: they're higher risk. So that's why you'll tend to you know that you'll tend to kind of do better
1093.74s: than what would be efficient. So like they made it that's they made an exception for small caps like
1097.74s: 20 years ago, but now because they've underperformance like oh no large caps will outperform because
1101.98s: like liquidity is there and all that. So the narrative changes over time. But in general in a normal
1106.78s: market cycle, correlations should be generally positive. I mean, no, it's the rising tide lifts all
1112.54s: boats like usually if Microsoft's doing well, it's because they're selling office subscriptions to
1116.22s: small medium-sized businesses. It's very rare that the largest five are doing phenomenal and
1121.98s: everybody else is not. So I think it's a weird moment in time which happens, which is kind of a
1128.06s: combination of inflation, safety trade, then suddenly like an infrastructure rollout that kind of
1132.78s: popped out out of nowhere, which I think will kind of come into line and we're going to see the
1135.74s: normal relationships show up soon. I see. Next question. What did you make of the velocity of small caps
1144.54s: on the way up first? So kind of talking about that gap day, was it like the the 11th or the 12th
1151.50s: and then the subsequent like three or four days after that? What I know that you're a student of
1156.78s: markets and market history and price behavior. Did you make anything specific of the velocity of
1162.54s: that move? So that was my concern. So even like with clients who are saying like, oh, you know,
1166.38s: now that we have these net highs, do we have this big bull market starting now because like small caps
1170.06s: took off. And so my concern, and this is like where the gut instinct will still kind of come in
1174.14s: because you have this indicator. And just knowing that there's some weird kind of issues going on
1178.70s: because of this disparity. But what I think happened was that just like what the yen carry trade
1183.82s: that blew up, it was the crowd of trade. Everyone was large, long large cap tech, short small caps.
1188.86s: And then we just went the other way really quickly as things started to reverse. So I think it was
1193.02s: just more of a big short squeeze like an basically a long squeeze on the long push people out both
1198.30s: directions. And that's why you just got so incredibly negatively correlated because I think that
1202.78s: was just funds way off base way overly concentrated being blown out in both directions. And so
1208.78s: that's why I think now you can see that that relationship has kind of fallen back into a little bit
1212.30s: more normal and normalcy than what it was for a little while there.
1215.90s: Got it. Okay. And then same question for the drawdown side of things. I personally thought it was
1222.46s: really interesting that we saw Russell pop. I mean, it was like one of the largest moves it's had
1229.18s: in its history over a seven day period. It was just incredible. And then over a three day period,
1234.70s: it literally undoes all of it. I was like, I was sitting there. I was just like,
1240.30s: what is going on? Like that's crazy to me. And I always thought it was a little bit of just
1247.98s: a overly reactive market, like very emphatic is what it seemed like to me. Like just people,
1254.38s: it's funny. You mentioned the idea of like this rapid repositioning because that's what it felt
1259.02s: like. That's kind of what I was seeing. But the way down typically quicker, but did you make
1265.18s: anything special about that three day period, essentially, where it just undid that entire move?
1272.06s: I think it was just easy come easy goes. And sometimes the market, there's so many elements of
1279.10s: this market. It's like long term, like yeah, fundamental, price action will fall,
1282.62s: fundamentals. In the short term, positioning is what dominates. Like I mean, the fundamentals
1286.70s: could be what they want. But if everyone is short, you're going to get, let me look at the
1289.98s: thing stop. I mean, like that's the extreme example. But like, even if that's like, you know,
1295.18s: in theory, the extreme point, there's different variations of that. So just like the carried trade,
1300.14s: I mean, look at the Nikae, like the entire index, like what are they? I think the third largest
1304.86s: economy in the world, you went from like all time highs to like 30% correction, like biggest drops
1309.42s: since 1987 within two weeks. And that's because positioning was so extreme. And again, we spoke about
1315.90s: that K kind of recovery where some are benefiting and most are not. Well, even if that's the case,
1321.58s: getting overly one-sided, then brings up these other kind of risks. And it's not that for, I mean,
1325.90s: other times I've traded, I remember the carried trades blown up in the past. And you always see this
1329.34s: kind of, you know, the oil trades blown up, the gold trades, every so often a trade blows up somewhere.
1334.70s: So always be cautious when it's like a very obvious positioning, like you need to be careful.
1339.98s: Yeah, yeah, interesting. Yeah, that's helpful context. Now, when you look at the movement
1346.30s: post drop, so moving from the fifth until essentially today, what do you notice between the indices?
1354.38s: Does anything stick out to you there? Yeah, so we bottomed, VIX hit was 65, so it was clearly
1363.26s: that, at least in the short term, it was extreme. Either we were going to rebound or we were going
1367.26s: to crash. So I mean, I think the bank of Japan backed off, which was the crisis of that moment.
1373.10s: So I think we started our rebound today. I think it was a little bit more of surprising that we
1377.66s: are so strong today. I think it's because PPI was low and they're expecting low CPIs or result tomorrow.
1383.10s: And again, I think so many people got like sold out of that drop. There's just that kind of
1387.66s: recovery coming back up. So I think it's just the normal mechanics. It's really hard to tell if
1393.34s: if the market isn't like still embarking on a deeper correction because of a weakening economy,
1397.26s: which I think it is, I think the economy is weakening in the feds behind the curve. If you look at
1401.10s: like the federal funds rate and two-year yield, they're like they're always late. So I think they're
1405.18s: late again. So just kind of buying off, you know, it's like just falling prey to that formal on
1411.02s: the way back up. Like I would at least want to see a bit of a retest, like coming down two,
1415.50s: three days, like how do you react when some selling pressure coming comes back in? So this is kind
1420.14s: of the vacuum back up because we had the vacuum down. And I think now the next few days is going to
1424.70s: be telling maybe we get a V recovery straight to the highs. That's happened historically, but it's
1429.82s: very it's very rare. It's very rare. If you go and study every drop that's like an excessive 10%,
1436.06s: it's very rare. You don't at least have even COVID like you you bottomed hard. You ran up for
1441.42s: three, four, five days and you had a little bit of a higher low and then you went and that was the
1445.02s: fed like throwing everything it could at the market. So to have a real completely V to all time highs,
1451.18s: very, very rare. So we'll see I think it's the market had the easy rebound. Like I said, because of
1455.74s: that vacuum and the next coming next few days is going to be important. What do you make of the
1461.42s: relationship between large cap and small cap? Now that's one thing I found interesting because it seems
1466.06s: like large cap has been exhibiting very similar to what you're talking about. This almost parabolic
1470.86s: now rise back up. Whereas it seems like small cap has already started consolidating. Do you make
1476.38s: anything there? I feel like you know, the same trade that was going on earlier was put on again. Like
1481.34s: I especially if you look at semi like semi, I mean the semi conductor index, I think felt 30%
1486.06s: from its highs into the drop early August. So again, funds that were blown out or those that were
1491.66s: in blow and they had it's like, Hey, let's put that trade back on again. You know, like like positions
1495.02s: back the normal. So I think you're just seeing a little bit of that trade put back on pretty clear.
1498.94s: It's like three or four days where large caps like easily outperform small caps. But again,
1505.26s: looking at the charts, even of the semis and like the larger players, this is still at normal
1509.58s: little bounce off the bottom. So running into their averages. I've never seen a bear marker where
1514.86s: you didn't have at least bear marker rallies. So it's really become that uptrend. You learn more
1519.10s: about the pullbacks and an uptrend than you do on the rally. So waiting to really see if we get
1522.78s: two or three days, four days correction. Do we just kind of flop over hard or is it is it bought into
1528.30s: by a funds? Yeah, that's a really interesting point. What did you make of the buy volume on the
1535.74s: fifth is an indicator of the way they might think about that? Because I was actually a little surprised
1540.46s: to see how strong the buying started to come in on the fifth when I just started to take a bite.
1545.34s: Do you think that that's informative whatsoever about what they might do if it gets back down to
1550.14s: that level again? Or do you think it's a completely new problem set at that point?
1555.42s: I think I've seen enough of these panics enough. For sure, some phone calls went off and the
1561.10s: people in the know were told KOK, bankage of pans in a back off, they're not going to keep raising
1565.66s: rates. Don't worry about it. We're not going to crash. We'll support more. So someone got the phone
1570.38s: calls. I think that Monday morning to alleviate panic. So you saw that even I bought, I was lucky.
1576.14s: I had no positions going into it. I had just one but it's like utility. It was untouched.
1581.26s: And so I mean, I did a little bit of buying that morning. But once you get that initial burst
1587.26s: off of the bottom, it's like, OK, where do we go from here? So I kind of eased out a little bit
1591.82s: out of things. And now it's waiting to see how we consolidate. It just so happens that we end up
1595.98s: going back a little more parabolic. But again, I think it's because people are slamming on that same
1599.66s: kind of large being long large semis, which what's strange about what's exacerbating the
1605.58s: weirdness of this market is that sometimes people will latch onto a trade. It could be like,
1609.90s: you know, other cycles, oil was the hot trade or whatever. It just so happens that the stocks that
1614.54s: are the hot trade now are like the biggest market cap stocks in the market. So if you're,
1619.34s: if you're ramming up these like seven, eight stocks like Broadcom and Vidya and that's enough
1623.58s: to move the whole market. And then everyone kind of just in unison. So it's a it's a particularly
1629.02s: odd market because the speculative names are the largest cap names, which is never usually the case.
1634.30s: So it's going to be interesting to see what comes next. Yeah, that's a really interesting point.
1639.10s: Honestly, one that I hadn't thought too much about the I mean, if you look back to the early 90s,
1643.74s: like when the internet was becoming a thing like IBM wasn't like the hot stock of the market,
1648.46s: you know what I mean? Or like if you go back to like, you know, early 2000s, like it wasn't,
1654.38s: you know, I don't know, Exxon mobile that was the hot stock of the market going up and down like
1658.70s: crazy. But like now that's what it is. I mean, like in Vidya, it's maybe not the largest market cap
1662.86s: anymore, but close enough and you know, up 7% one day down for like though that's kind of like the
1667.74s: actually usually a small cap stock. So pretty wild. Right. Yeah. What do you think about the current
1674.22s: positioning of things in the economy with respect to a prospective recession?
1680.46s: I think we're slowing it. We just had home people come out this morning saying that the
1684.22s: consumer's slowing. So I think you're, you know, Starbucks been having a hard time. You're seeing
1687.66s: it in a lot of different places. And it makes sense. I mean, we went from zero to five and a half
1691.42s: percent in a straight line. I think there was like that excess, you know, COVID savings lying around
1695.98s: that's been fully worn off here. So I think we're clearly seeing the slowdown. That's why inflation's
1701.42s: coming down. And you know, as investors, it's always easy to kind of like play one day, you know,
1706.30s: quarterback for the Fed like all they should do this and do that. But if I was the Fed, I would rather
1712.62s: be a little extra hawkish and see the market break down and see a small recession and see inflation
1717.58s: ignite again. Like it's far easier to resuscitate like a small recession than to like
1723.98s: re kind of anchor people expecting a lot of inflation. If that happens, you set off a decade of
1729.42s: trouble. So it's like, I get what Powell's doing. Like he's going to be, it's always the kind of
1734.14s: easy to play the blame game like, oh, they're going to put us into a recession. Like, I think the US
1737.98s: economy is far stronger than anyone would have expected with five and a half percent like federal
1742.30s: funds, right? Like far stronger, which so I mean, I don't see a big, usually a big bear market comes
1748.94s: around when something systemically breaks or you go into like a hard recession. Like, I don't
1753.74s: not really see that. I think this is like normal corrective stuff because it was like large caps
1757.82s: got ahead of themselves. I think if we even correct a little bit longer and further, it's like we
1761.98s: just set up like a really strong potential bull market. I mean, think about it once, once inflation
1767.66s: gets re anchored at 2%, you have like a new kind of massive productivity boost like with AI,
1773.18s: which could be somewhat like the internet. We'll see how it develops whether it does or doesn't.
1778.22s: But markets are already generally strong. Economies are strong and the feds about to go to begin
1782.70s: a rate cut cycle. So I mean, it's pretty it's pretty wild to have like all that going on. I mean,
1788.38s: we don't know who's going to become president, but let's say it's it's Trump and he also then has more
1792.06s: like tax cutting policies. So you'll get like, you know, stimulus from tax cuts. You'll get stimulus
1796.70s: from fed rate cuts. You have maybe a potential AI productivity boom. So I mean, if all that
1804.86s: work to come together, that shapes up for like a multi year like super bull market. I mean, there's a lot
1809.98s: of variables there, but we'll see something to be really, you know, optimistic about I think.
1815.90s: You mentioned being close to a rate cut cycle, which I agree with, right? We can kind of see that
1821.42s: through the bond market. What do you think about small cap positioning right now, though, in relation
1826.70s: to that? I think there's going to be a catch up move. You know, it's it's awful because I think small
1833.58s: caps got hammered twofold, which is frustrating for people because the inflation, you know, they
1838.06s: didn't have good pricing power. And now recession hits them first before. I mean, you're more likely
1842.94s: to not go to your local store than not get an iPhone. So they kind of got hit both sides. So I
1848.46s: I think it's just a lead to basically everyone being out of small caps, even mid caps. I mean, never
1852.86s: we say small, even mid. I mean, this has really been just a large cap game has been where like all
1857.26s: the heat has been. So that's why I think that all these like I said, things like rate cuts, things
1862.22s: like rate cut cycle, all this is going to benefit. I think everyone outside, I mean, large cap is one
1867.98s: now, but on a relative basis, I would imagine that once we turn the corner, mid and small, they're
1873.18s: going to have like some epic epic runs that we haven't seen in a long time, I think.
1878.62s: That was honestly my assessment as well, but it's also part of my current confusion because I think
1885.02s: that's a big part of what we saw that original run in small caps in that it seemed like we thought
1891.74s: we were on the cost of these rate cuts and kind of starting a front run that move. And then
1898.70s: what surprises me now, though, is that it seems like the probability of a rate cut is even
1902.94s: higher in small caps or kind of just lay in there. I haven't been really able to make heads or
1908.22s: tails of that yet. Sometimes it's just a timing thing. You know, like I've noticed that in my career.
1913.18s: So like sometimes I've missed out on some epic opportunities because I was super long, like,
1917.50s: didn't it doesn't happen for like one month, two months and you say, oh, maybe I'm just like wrong
1921.10s: about that idea, but then it's like six months later, it kicks off, you know, so sometimes it's like
1926.14s: I've just noticed like I've just, if I feel I have a good story, like it's always practice risk
1929.98s: management first, like I'd rather be wrong five times under perform, but my capital is intact.
1934.22s: Like I really don't care. But then after one, if it is right, then you nail it. But then
1938.94s: some it's really just actually going back to reminisces to stock opera. There's like a cool story
1942.78s: he talks about where like he finally learns like how to short and all this kind of stuff and he gets
1947.26s: this right positioning. He's like, I got everything right, but I didn't realize, you know, I saw this big
1951.98s: heap of gold. There was like a wheelbarrow at a shovel help yourself. I didn't realize it was a
1955.82s: time lock. And I ran too fast. I fell. I tripped and I missed all the gold and I ended up losing money.
1960.54s: So like that time element, and just sometimes I think as traders, we can see better into the future
1967.10s: than others, but then after we kind of get ahead of the actual market itself. So sometimes it's just
1971.02s: patience, I think. Yeah, I think that makes sense too. It's funny when you were talking about the
1975.82s: the timing element, because I think you just about perfectly described the Russell trade that I had
1981.42s: on the beginning of the year that just did nothing for two months. And I was just like, all right,
1985.90s: man, I guess I'm just the village idiot. Okay. So then I moved on to something else, but I set a
1990.70s: bunch of alerts because I was just like, I just know that this, I just know this is going to pop at
1995.82s: some point. So I'm going to get it all in five days and you weren't positioned yet. I was actually
2002.94s: super stoked because as soon as it made that first gap up, I missed the like the first half of that
2009.10s: first days gap up. I missed that gap up. But from there, as soon as I saw that, I was just like,
2014.38s: load the boats, bro, I just folded everything into it. And then I kind of just trend followed it
2021.02s: down a little bit. I actually have a video coming out soon talking about more specifically the
2024.62s: strategy I used a ratio called diagonal. And I use that trade as the vector just because it's a
2029.42s: recent one that was kind of entertaining. So I get to talk about how dumb I was at the beginning of it.
2034.14s: But yeah, I was like, I was sitting there. I was just like, I don't know if I'm pissed off right
2039.58s: now because it took so long to happen. But then it literally is essentially made the years worth
2045.26s: of moves in like six days. So how mad do I get to be? And I haven't really figured that out. Yeah,
2052.46s: I'm still pretty pissed off though because in the beginning, I was just looking left looking right
2057.18s: and I was just like, what's happening? What's small? Do something.
2061.26s: Well, if you think that makes you upset, I had a position SMCI last year. That's one of the best
2066.94s: for so last year at let me look my chart here. So from like June, it was a 200. I had like, I had
2073.74s: built a big portfolio. Like I think I was like a 40, 50% position in SMCI portfolio from like 200 up to
2081.26s: 340. And then earnings were sour or kind of gaped down. So I got out of it with like, you know,
2086.70s: some profit, but less profit. And like I'm watching and there was so many failed attempts. And all the sudden
2091.66s: like January, it's like lagging, really keep you up at the market. And all of a sudden from 300,
2095.74s: you're 1200 is like the trade of the year. I'm like, use anyways, I was like again, being a little
2101.66s: bit early sometimes. And that's just and how to have that same position would have been like, wow,
2105.50s: like epic year again. Yeah, yeah. What can you do? That's exactly how she goes. Well, and you also
2111.50s: know exactly what would have happened. If you stayed in the trade, you personally would have crashed
2116.78s: SMCI or whatever reason, if you had stayed in that trade, SMCI wouldn't have made that move.
2121.90s: Something terrible would have happened. And it would have sounded like shit, I should have got out.
2128.30s: I've learned to reconcile that the market is one of the only forces I've ever met that can make
2133.34s: two people with opposing positions simultaneously wrong. And it has a
2138.22s: as a slick way of doing it too, because you do the way you did something different, but we both lost
2143.26s: how? I don't know how anyone who's traded long enough can be egotistical. I don't know. To me,
2148.86s: it's impossible. It's like if you have an ego after trading for like five, 10 years plus,
2155.02s: wow, there's something special about every single person I know has traded for a living is a very
2159.90s: like centered person like, okay, that's that's what the market gave me and like just move on,
2163.98s: you know, like it just it'll grind you into into the ground if you let it so. I literally couldn't
2169.98s: agree with you more. There's actually a saying that I use with people at home like, do you want to
2174.22s: be right or do you want to make money? And I know there was some people who really like, you know,
2178.78s: the the skill set of being able to be right. Actually Jim Ropel is wonderful. I asked him that question.
2183.98s: He's like, he's like, no, I want to be right. And I was just like, okay, it's totally fair, man.
2188.46s: Because like some people really, really like that process. And in that process, they get to make money.
2193.10s: But for me specifically, and I think for a lot of people that have egos, it's really important.
2199.58s: At least for me to always put like first things first, which is I could be completely wrong in
2205.58s: make money. All right, can be completely right and lose money. But the important part is figuring
2209.98s: out a system to interface with the market and make money in the long run, which is the whole whole
2214.14s: can't go brutal for me at least. I think I still would. Sorry. No, I'll say like I found that
2221.02s: markets go through like repetitive three, four month cycles. Like every three, four months,
2224.94s: like the whole you get a new wave and new winners come out. So like, you know, I've been trading
2229.98s: professionally since 2008. I started trading 2003, 2004. Like I've seen these cycles so many times.
2235.58s: And sometimes you get them so like I've had like some really epic runs in three, four months.
2240.86s: Like, you know, multi hundred percent return. And then other time it's like, your lag for 12
2245.58s: months, it's 18 months where you just like, you're making a big play. You just, you just can't get
2249.82s: it to connect. So like when you go to that cycle multiple times, you just realize like, okay,
2254.06s: it's one of those cycles and you just have to learn to be centered and not like blame yourself or
2258.14s: not go off and change everything and just stay centered and stay focused because like it's just
2262.22s: this recurring cycle of being sometimes super right. But then other times just not getting it. So
2267.10s: well, you also said something there that I think is really important because I find trading in
2271.66s: general is like the the art of balance. You got to balance so many things. And to your point right
2277.18s: there, like if you miss time a cycle, there's you have to have enough self scrutiny to look at
2284.38s: what you did and make sure that you did programmatically what made sense. But to your point,
2291.58s: sometimes the market is just going to throw something else. And I'm actually curious how you
2296.62s: think about solving that dichotomy because you can't put your hands up and just be like, oh,
2301.34s: the market is just doing whatever the market does and not hold yourself accountable. But you also
2305.26s: can't punish yourself into the dirt because if you do that, the market to your point will continue
2310.30s: to humble you. Do you have any thoughts about like how to reconcile those two things as a trader?
2315.02s: So it's funny. You speak of Jim Ropel. So I you know, I talk with Jim sometimes and he's a
2318.86s: super nice guy. And there's something I kind of stole from him. He calls him guard rails. You
2323.34s: know, like things that you just want to make sure you don't make like a serious mistake. So like
2327.58s: what I've I've tried to do like cycle after cycle is like what was the biggest mistake that caused
2334.70s: like like there's always going to be small mistakes, but those can be watched away. Like were there
2337.90s: any like like more serious mistakes? And so I kind of like trying line up different rules to be those
2344.78s: guard rails to not make them again, you know? So like for example, like looking back at the past like,
2350.14s: you know, year and a half, I always focus on small mid gaps. That's always just where all the
2354.78s: actions always been. So it's like I saw Nvidia. I saw that I had relative strength. I had earnings
2358.94s: and sales and all that kind of stuff. But just wasn't a focus of mine, you know? So because I've always
2363.18s: figured like, you know, it's already trillion dollar company. You're really going to triple from here
2365.98s: in six months. Well, apparently you want. So, but no, like the bingo cards. Yeah, exactly. You
2372.94s: know? But again, like so it's like you have the rules of like relative strength. Well, oh, like if
2378.94s: you if a stock won't go down when the market is down, like last to me, like looking back at Nvidia,
2383.98s: in March of 2023, when there was that like banking crisis, and everyone forgot about happened for
2388.46s: like a couple of months, when the markets all kind of sold off and like Nvidia was still like climbing
2394.14s: and either climbing or just going dead sideways, like that was you don't need to know the news.
2399.66s: You almost don't even know to know need to know earnings and sales. If the market's going to drop
2402.94s: 10% and you're like at least a mid cap or higher. So you're not just like a small cap story.
2407.82s: If you won't fall when the market's falling 10 or 15%, somebody does not want to sell you or
2413.42s: somebody wants to buy every single share they can get. So to me, it's like again, for this past
2418.22s: cycle, looking at it, you know, I always put a lot of weight on the net highs and at lows, but I
2422.62s: think that the most important factor for me above all, no matter how each cycle as I study things,
2427.34s: that relative strength, like and that comes through in the corrections. Like even now we had this
2432.22s: correction, everyone's going to go back and look at let's say micron or SMCI that were hot last
2437.34s: cycle. But those are not the ones that held up well in this cycle the same way. There's new names,
2441.58s: there's new things going on. So again, like why chase micron that's fallen 30, 40% when something
2447.50s: like Palantir is already back at 52 week highs and barely budge during like the market sell off.
2452.38s: So it's like every cycle again, you get that opportunity and have those guard rails so you don't
2456.62s: make that same kind of mistake you made on a prior cycle. Eventually, as long as you manage risk,
2461.02s: you're going to kill it then one of the cycles and do great. Yeah, that's awesome. I love that.
2465.34s: What a great way to look at it. When you look at the market behavior this year, one of the things
2470.46s: I like to do is just try to decouple different inputs on the markets and just try to assess the
2475.58s: overall impact. It's just kind of general curiosity for me. And the election part of this year is
2482.30s: weird because there's a lot of other things going on. And the election has its own personality
2489.10s: and the impact that that can have, especially with the latest change in candidacy. It looks like
2494.70s: Kamala, it will be the democratic nominee when everybody is originally expecting Biden until
2499.02s: pretty recently. So when you look at this kind of election year, how do you think that that
2505.66s: impacts markets broadly? Because to me, it's competing with interest rates, kind of other things at
2512.54s: the same time. Yeah, and this is an important one because it's not like Canadian politics. It doesn't
2519.66s: matter, right? Like, you know, but like, I'll tie, especially outside Canada, you know, it doesn't
2525.02s: really matter. But, you know, like this cycle, like Trump, like, you know, the view of the two
2530.14s: people, Trump versus Kamala, like, it's like dramatic differences in what their view is for,
2536.30s: right? You know, the economy and what the impact will be. Like, I mean, I try and even
2541.10s: what clients be politically neutral, but like, there's one thing to me that's not neutral. It's just
2544.14s: like, you know, economic outcomes. I'm a free market person, low taxes person, you know,
2550.30s: free competition, you know, no monopolies. And that's like what leads to the long-term success of
2555.90s: countries and nations, you know? So, you know, for a moment, the look like Trump had kind of a
2560.06s: a sure victory, like whether you love him or not, that's a net positive for the economy and for
2564.54s: markets. In Kamala, where, wow, I mean, it's, it's, it's, you know, news is funny. Like, no one really
2571.26s: seemed to like her six months ago or even ever see her. And now suddenly, it's like, she's supposed
2575.74s: to be like the favorite, this favorite candidate almost at an overnight, but her economic views,
2581.58s: which I'm not even very sure of, but like, I, from what I understand, her father was even like a
2585.74s: Marxist professor. So she's always, she's always been kind of on the very, very left side of the
2590.22s: spectrum, even how she's voted and stuff. So those are all policies that are negatives. And I,
2595.66s: I think sometimes people don't even realize how fast negative economic policies can impact
2600.46s: a country. Like we have, oh, interesting. A left leaning, a person here, true to one
2605.42s: Canada. And from when, since he took election, like, we're like the lowest, you know, product,
2610.46s: the productivity growing country in the G7, like we've, the spread between US growth and productivity
2616.38s: in Canadian growth, growth of productivity is like widened, I think, to near like historic levels.
2621.26s: Like it makes a, it may not be in three months, but fast forward four or five, seven, eight years,
2626.30s: and you can have some really dramatic changes to an economy for like, for the worse.
2631.10s: So I think it makes a big impact. And I think when, until markets figure out which way it's going to go,
2635.26s: there's going to be some flip flopping back and forth. But ultimately, I think will be a big, big net
2640.14s: positive if Trump was elected or at least if his economic, you know, ideas come to fruition over
2645.34s: Kamala's. And how do you think the market is perceiving those two outcomes right now? Because one of
2654.54s: the things I've been looking at from the options market is just the positioning in the options
2658.94s: chains right around the election. And there's probably what you would imagine. I see it most years
2663.02s: with an election is just a lot of hedging. There's a lot, a lot of relatively long-term hedges being
2668.38s: put on, which it's been slightly anomalous this year is that they started going on earlier than
2672.86s: I typically would expect to see them. But do you think that there is any positioning within the
2677.90s: market kind of like in a holding pattern until we get closer to seeing what that's actually going
2683.34s: to look like or now? Yeah, I think so. And like I said, there's those multiple tailwinds that are
2689.10s: coming. And the Trump one or those economic policies is a wild card. And I mean, if you have,
2696.86s: let's say, a fed cutting cycle coming in or even let's say a productivity boom, but then if you
2701.82s: have someone who puts up more regulation or has more like really poor fiscal spending, at least to
2707.42s: inflation that prevents the rate cut. Like there's bad fiscal policies that can ruin these
2713.18s: other tailwinds that are building right now. So it's a big wild card. And so I think part of
2721.10s: part of the last leg up was I think a little bit of excitement over like Trump leading in polls.
2726.30s: You saw like crypto getting a bit of a boost as even like he's kind of leaning more positively
2730.38s: there. And so then I think just the massive positioning and then everything also Kamala kind of
2734.30s: coming through and like raising kind of odds of her waiting the presidency. I think that also
2738.62s: kind of weighed on the market drop. Well, so just kind of like a little perfect storm that hit like
2741.90s: late July, early August, with Japan and all this kind of stuff at once. So I think definitely it's
2746.70s: going to be, it's going to make things wild the next few months. And I don't know which way it's
2751.02s: going to turn out. So it's going to be interesting. Yeah. And I know we're coming up on time. I don't
2755.34s: want to hold you too late. But a follow on to that though, then is how do you personally think about
2762.86s: approaching markets then leading it to the event? Because like you're talking about, because I agree
2766.62s: with you like to me, it seems like the outcome of the election, whichever way it goes, it will
2773.18s: mean something for markets. So for me, I, well, I mostly trade shorter term anyways, to be honest,
2779.74s: like let's just keep it up a buck here. It's like if it's a three week trade, that's an
2785.26s: eternity. That is like I am geriatric at that point. I am, yeah, I mean, just what I don't even know
2791.34s: to do with all that time. So the vast majority of my stuff is two weeks maybe. So for me, the general
2798.62s: game plan I'm using is just kind of honestly like trading the general book leading into, but I
2803.58s: am actually avoiding more thematic positions that I typically would put on like one of my favorite
2808.62s: things that traders is general positive drift in the market. Super simple trade, not much goes
2813.66s: into it, size it down, use options, just say, lovey and come back to it in six months. Now I don't
2820.86s: have that on. And part of it is because the recent market activity, but also because I have some
2826.70s: reservations about how this could go. So in your opinion, how do you set yourself up leading into
2835.02s: the election, understanding that it can have a pretty big impact. It's hard. It's one of those
2841.98s: things like, you know, month to month, week to week is all this macro, week, economic data. So
2845.74s: you have to kind of like separate your views and even like some stuff we're talking about is
2850.22s: longer term, like let's say, like it's a like, and she doesn't have great economic policies. Like,
2854.70s: you know, at the same time, like you want to avoid like this concern, it's not going to be this
2857.82s: overnight, like, oh, she's going to trash the economy. And like I just think, you know, she's
2861.98s: going to be more of the policies we have, which will generally favor larger companies, weigh a
2866.54s: little more like in terms of smaller companies and all that kind of stuff. So like I don't think
2870.22s: what have I mean, I think though of Trump, we're to get a like these, he's like a faster moving kind
2874.30s: of guy. He wants to like implement things quicker and he's got like, and what he would implement
2879.42s: would be quite a change from the current. So I think if he would comment be kind of more upside
2885.18s: quicker, but I think if Kamala like ends up winning, I think it's just a little more status
2890.14s: quality. Just want to continue to watch what you guys doing. So like if anything that may, which
2894.78s: is I think good for the US in a sense, you have almost like an asymmetry where I don't think she
2898.62s: would be terrible right. Repulsions immediately longer term depends on what she would do with
2904.62s: but Trump, I think if he would win, would be kind of a pretty immediate like positive, I think,
2908.22s: for markets. I see. Got it. Yeah. Yeah. Um, last question before we sign off here, what are your
2916.86s: favorite things that you're looking at right now? So like, like I mentioned before, I get excited.
2922.70s: Like I don't always catch every uptrend perfect, but I've never been caught in a big downtrend.
2927.34s: Thankfully, you know, knock on wood, you know, so again, I was uh, cashed up for this drop. So,
2933.02s: and I was not that I was killing it before. So at least I, you know, I didn't kill it on the way up,
2936.38s: I didn't get killed on the way down. But again, now is that great time where you can see who didn't fall
2941.66s: in this market draw. And so I'm watching stocks. Like I said, I mentioned Palantir, which is,
2945.50s: I think Palantir is really interesting because their growth is really picking up. If you look at their
2949.42s: sales growth, not only are they growing, but the rate of their revenue growth is accelerating,
2953.98s: which is phenomenal. And they're on like key themes like obviously AI, defense spending, and
2959.82s: and all the rest. So they're really interesting. Then after we're looking at some other,
2964.70s: like the large caps, like meta as held in great, I think meta is someone where like data has become
2971.42s: all the more valuable with AI and all the rest. So I think they're just going to find more and more
2975.58s: tailwinds like monetize all of that and reach out to new people. So again, they held them very well.
2979.82s: There's just a lot of great names that did not break down with this market environment. And a lot
2984.22s: of them are midcaps. You know, there's things like Kava, which is the restaurant,
2988.22s: a Mediterranean restaurant group. There's just so many I can name like a service now is more large cap
2993.26s: held in well. So it's just really keeping on all those stocks. I did not break down. They're already
2998.54s: trading at 52 week highs. Some of them with the market still quite a ways off. So they are all
3004.46s: very, very being closely washed to me looking for some kind of consolidation. See what the market does
3008.38s: after this initial bounce when it kind of corrects. But it has been very exciting because every time
3014.70s: you have these corrections, those stocks that don't fall, then they'll become the epic winners for
3018.06s: the next three to four months. But you need the market to participate. That's always that's always
3022.38s: that key thing. I always know which stocks will work, but you never quite know when that market will
3026.78s: bottom. And until the market bottoms, it's like it's that anchor on them. So you have to kind of
3031.90s: still need to get that timing right. But I think there's some clear leaders that are really kind of
3035.98s: coming through, which is nice to see. Yeah, that's awesome. And what would a great note to end on.
3041.34s: Plus, I mean, we can also just shout out the fact that the prospect of getting timing right for
3045.66s: you. Boa is about no. So I'll continue to mess up all the timing on all those, even though you
3049.74s: gave me the script. I'll still dork it all up. But dude, absolute pleasure always hanging out with
3055.34s: me. I like I absolutely love having the opportunity to to pick your brain, learn from you every single
3061.02s: time. I get to walk away with a few nuggets. So thanks for hanging out. I will definitely send a,
3066.22s: you know, in the description below all the links to your website newsletter, which is great.
3071.34s: Your ex profile, but is there anywhere else that you want to send people to?
3075.90s: I'm also on YouTube. I try and increase posting frequency outside the summer. Summer gets a little
3080.86s: bit, you know, I get a little bit slower sometimes, but you could also check everyone's watching on
3085.10s: YouTube. So if you look me up on YouTube, you'll find YouTube. Beautiful. Yeah, I'll tag you in this
3089.34s: so that it'll pop up on your stuff too. So that they'll get get over to your channel. They definitely
3093.58s: should. So thanks for hanging out. Thanks for hanging out. Everybody else being outlier. And we'll
