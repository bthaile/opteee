0.00s:  like we are live. What is up everybody? Hopefully we got apes, outliers, glorious mix there of.
7.68s:  You guys will have to forgive the screen and set up a my end. I am on the mobile setup right now.
12.48s:  I'm hanging out in New York and we got our boys PB with his ever-evolving backdrop that is
18.32s:  becoming more and more chic and then we got Kevin and I am absolutely stoked to get a chance to
23.76s:  me with you. I've been watching your material, like your tweets and stuff and I just really like the
29.20s:  content that you're putting out and stuff you're talking about. So stoked to get a chance to chat with you.
33.12s:  Yeah, appreciate it man. Thanks for having me on. Beautiful. So the overall
40.16s:  background I've ran into GameStop just to the table set super fast is I've been a trader for this is
48.96s:  my 17th year of trading. I started back when I was in high school. Super super lucky. The guys
52.64s:  saw some staying in right now is actually the dude that introduced me to investing and he sent me
56.80s:  down a completely different life path and I've traded GameStop before but from an options trading
63.12s:  perspective which is super volatile. Lots of movement for me to be able to trade and then this
69.04s:  most recent move that we had in the spring, May, June, like that time frame. I started seeing
74.56s:  unusual options activity kicking up again. Volume starting to kick up and so it started trading it.
78.72s:  Now at this point though, I had a YouTube channel which is completely different. I'm looking at it
83.76s:  with the different lens. There's people that are explaining a lot of what's going on and then
88.24s:  this is now the 20 26th episode of me doing like specific videos about this. So it's that's at least
96.56s:  30 hours in live streams alone just exploring GameStop beyond all the research I've been doing.
102.16s:  So I am infatuated by the whole saga. I would love to hear Kevin from your perspective a little
110.80s:  bit about how you found your way into GameStop because you also come from a bit of a more professional
116.80s:  background as you can tell because I'm a dude in a t-shirt and you're looking fine a f in your suit.
121.92s:  So I would love to learn how you got into GameStop and like what your general lens is there.
128.08s:  I got into GameStop right after COVID hit and I was just researching all and screening all the
142.00s:  companies that I've just gotten obliterated by the news and the pandemic seeing what opportunities
147.92s:  were out there. Things that aren't going to go bankrupt. Things that will survive in this pandemic.
156.96s:  And when I was screening them I noticed that GameStop had 99.99% short float reported.
168.48s:  And so I was like what? Who would do that? So I called the info company and or the company that I
178.00s:  got my data from and asked them is this the real short interest or is this the highest your numbers can
188.56s:  go on the data screen and they said that's the highest or numbers can go and I was just like
195.12s:  oh my god this only takes one news article to explode. So I started getting all my clients into a
202.72s:  small position at you know split adjusted a dollar a share and you know just waiting it out over
215.68s:  the summer kind of bounced flat and then Ryan Cohen comes in as the largest holder and
227.28s:  buys a significant portion of the company and I was like that's the news that's going to send this.
234.08s:  And from that day on the cycle started and then not being able to find shares started going up.
245.28s:  I can't say that part because it's going to be in our documentary but then January 21
251.20s:  happens. I left Edward Jones I was at Edward Jones at that time my clients were top 10 shareholder of
260.32s:  GameStop in 2020 before the sneeze and then after January left Jones and opened up my own
272.48s:  firm and the rest is kind of history from there that's how I found it. I was talking with Keith
282.08s:  Gill and other people in 2020 going over the strategy the deep value everything like that
289.12s:  and it's crazy because I didn't know Keith was also a financial professional and then once everything
297.20s:  came out and him getting called into Congress are pretty much just white internet clean. I was like
305.76s:  I don't know what that sounds fun to me. Yeah fascinating and then just one quick follow up for you
310.72s:  specifically from a professional investing slash trading background you obviously are working
318.96s:  with clients and one of the things you're working with your clients is this GameStop position
323.76s:  prospectively and was that something at the time that was like a hard sell or was it something that
330.32s:  you already did in different kinds of forms with other positions and this was just another one of
335.28s:  those types. Another one of those types I had an I have an eye for a anomalies and noticing like things
344.80s:  are off or things are on like chart patterns and so my clients before it had these crazy positions
352.64s:  or short squeezes that had ended up being 5x to 15x money just based on me researching so much.
362.48s:  My father who was also a financial advisor in my entire life I'm a second-gen he called me and
369.12s:  after I sent him one of my white papers he's like God you you should have been an analyst but
375.52s:  they don't make any money and I was like yeah I just weirdly have a passion for research
382.48s:  like the three of us all do and I just nailed in on my niche once we could
390.08s:  once commissions were kind of gone and manage money started where you know percentage of the
396.56s:  portfolio value I realized I could use all my research to grow my clients money which would
405.60s:  literally benefit me and more money they make more money I make and love the strategy took
410.56s:  all the pressure off of them because Jones was still the highest commission probably in the United
415.68s:  States that 2% buys or sells for stock so you know 100,000 or buy of Apple they had to pay 2 grand
423.28s:  in commission for it so once I was calling clients to you know what sell this to buy this
430.08s:  they know that that called made me zero dollars cost them zero dollars and I only think it's the
437.44s:  best thing for them because I get nothing out of it except for their portfolio performance.
446.64s:  I figured the the next thing I wanted to talk about because PB I've had a chance to pick your
450.56s:  brain a bit about how you got involved in game stuff and like the history so I thought we could
456.24s:  just change gears for a minute and do a bit of a current state assessment. I'd love to hear
462.96s:  really from both of you but we could start with PB to get a sense of just where we are with game
468.64s:  stop today and what your general thoughts are about price action how things are positioned
473.04s:  don't have to go into whether or not you think that there's a squeeze coming or anything like that
476.96s:  like just overall level setting and then just one other admin note for the question
482.32s:  I very much view myself as like a guest in the ape house because I know that there's people
489.04s:  have been in this thing for four years now and that's not my path right I'm a traitor I'm in
494.80s:  an out of things so I really like to be able to understand the perspective of people and PB and I
501.28s:  have had a chance to talk to a few times so I've also been able to see the arc of his perspective
506.96s:  which hopefully have a chance to understand yours as well and the evolution of the Kevin but PB
512.80s:  current state of game stop where we have sure so I think this year especially as we're closing
520.40s:  out 2024 it's been a very transformative year for game stop you know we've had basically two
526.24s:  prior years of almost like a slow steady grind in both stock price and also company performance
533.52s:  Ryan Cohen was essentially committed to making game stop cash positive and to stop
539.92s:  seeing bleeding losses every single year you know he wanted this this uh overall business
545.28s:  transformation to take place but it's taken longer than he's wanted to and so he's had to let go of
551.36s:  you know executive sees appointed he's made some blunders right they did the crypto marketplace
557.92s:  which kind of fell apart and and didn't provide enough revenue um and so he was trying to write like
563.76s:  he was trying to justify his investment is trying to say like look this company was bleeding but we
568.16s:  can turn it around we can fix these these problems and you know finally this year they've been able to
574.80s:  make it cash positive and you know reduce SG&A enough to actually make the margins worth it and a
580.72s:  lot a large part of that means closing stores I think something like 20% of the stores uh they've
586.24s:  closed and so their overall square footage has reduced and then so has their net sales but the
591.28s:  benefit with that is you know becoming profitable is obviously more valuable than just being a bigger
597.84s:  company that's unprofitable and that's bleeding every single quarter um and so this year
603.60s:  sorry I just had a question on that for the store closures is that mostly been in Europe
608.00s:  it in my remember in that crackler is that also like 50 50 split I thought it was mostly Europe
613.04s:  I just don't remember I think it is mostly Europe but there are some there are some closures in the
617.76s:  OS as far as I know and I haven't looked at the breakdown I just know it's around 22% of total
622.88s:  square footage has been lost since like 2021 I think thank you sir um and maybe Kevin you can fact
628.56s:  check me on that number if you know it's different um but this year right like we saw DFB return
636.72s:  in a big way and we saw the gamma squeeze and you know the short squeeze thesis kind of play out
642.40s:  again and game shop was able to take advantage of this price action you know pretty uh pretty
648.56s:  adeptly and and raise a huge amount of capital um from share offerings so they did first the
655.60s:  the initial share offering in in May uh in ATM um which was around I think like you know between 40
663.20s:  and 30 dollars per share um and then they did which raised you know like one or two one and a half
668.72s:  billion I think and then they did another share offering in June when DFB started tweeting again and
673.76s:  and the game around built even stronger we saw the price skyrocket to like $80 share uh and games
680.40s:  up did another ATM they started you know selling at you know huge amounts of of of shares and and
686.96s:  raising you know up to what they have now is 4.5 and change billion dollars of cash and so you know
695.52s:  we've known for a while that Ryan Cohen not only wanted to just save this company from dying he
700.48s:  actually wanted to transform it into you know you could call it like a chewy like uh business right
706.96s:  an online e-commerce company that could compete with like a sub amazon and now with this cash
713.20s:  on hand they actually finally have the ability to to make this reality and a large part of this
719.04s:  speculation online has been right like they're going to use this cash as a tool to acquire other
724.72s:  companies and then those companies hopefully have synergy with game stops legacy business
729.60s:  and then that can help propel them you know in the coming years and quarters um to further success
735.92s:  but the problem that we've obviously run into is we haven't seen what that is yet we don't know
740.40s:  and so it's the same thing I said back in October I think right like we're still kind of waiting on
744.80s:  our hands and they haven't given any indication um as to what exactly they are going to do with the
751.60s:  money now if you read like the financial statements the 10 q's and then the earning reports the one
756.56s:  thing that they've said consistently since they raised this cash is they've said they will use it
762.80s:  for general corporate purposes and and and and and or including merges and acquisitions and they
769.36s:  include that exact phrase in every single statement they've put out so they're kind of hinting that
774.64s:  they're looking at this but again until they actually make the move we don't know and they probably
778.96s:  want to keep that right on the down low as long as possible yeah and that makes it ton of sense too
784.64s:  because I mean companies like that when they raise cash typically it's for a reason of some sort
789.44s:  to your point really opportunistic raise but yeah sitting on a pile of cash as a company it's
794.88s:  only so good until you find a way to you know generate revenue from it so interesting update thank you
800.08s:  and then um heaven I'd love to to hear your current perspective of just where the company is and
807.92s:  from from you Kevin I if you don't mind I would also love to understand from like your involvement
813.44s:  in 2020 and your perspective at that time how is it shifted to where we are today just because I
820.24s:  like I don't know I enjoy understanding more the details on like the arc of analysis
827.04s:  sure um I'll start off really quick by answering uh Peruvians as a February game stop still had
835.84s:  41 69 stores open um they closed over 1100 so with the news on Europe's closures
848.88s:  were probably sitting close to 1500 closed and 3600 so third are going to be closing um we don't
858.64s:  know that number until next earnings comes out for the quarter uh as far as games up right now and
868.88s:  last piggyback on Peruvians in the wording of the report with their cash by how they can also
875.84s:  buy marketable securities which is at the full discretion of Ryan Cohen so they can now pretty
883.68s:  much be a holding company of individual stock I have not found out
890.64s:  anyone that can prove my loophole wrong about them swing trading their own stock under that
900.64s:  word of marketable securities so usually when a company buys back stock they retire those shares
908.64s:  and it you know goes lower and lower and lower but there's nothing saying they can't buy shares
915.12s:  of their own company not retire them and then sell them for profit so that was by far the most
923.52s:  exciting thing that I noticed in the wording that I could not figure out the answers to as far as
929.36s:  games on now compared to 2020 at that time short squeeze play anything that's shorted
936.40s:  99.99 or more I just saw it as you know this thing just needs one catalyst and I would not buy brick and
944.96s:  mortar for my clients at that time I'm like you know for years they're asking hey let's buy a sear
949.68s:  is it's down 90% or these companies and I'm like you really want to compete with Amazon like are
955.92s:  you going to order more stuff from sears or buy more stuff in sears or order stuff on Amazon
960.88s:  but the short squeeze play in the last four years turned into a complete turnaround of a profitable
966.16s:  company nobody on Wall Street no analyst thought it could ever be done and now with even more
973.84s:  unprofitable source closed the profitability is just going to grow can't guarantee that but if they
981.12s:  do everything exactly the same then profitability would grow on the next earnings report and
990.56s:  they have this cash pile now that number one I agree with proven they don't want to say what they're
996.80s:  going to use it for give any hints and if they don't have any backdoor ideas right now then
1004.64s:  Ryan Cohen and GameStop is sitting on a higher cash percentage than Berkshire Hathaway right now
1009.84s:  with markets at all time highs so wait for dip crash whatever it is to buy cheaper really good
1018.96s:  companies for mergers and acquisitions or with the marketable securities you know buy Apple the
1025.20s:  next time it's right it drops 33% or Tesla next time it drops 70% or Nvidia the next time it drops 70%
1033.92s:  and so he's got this word chest not only profitability but cash that is back ended up going into
1042.88s:  a possible market downturn to deploy at that time
1049.92s:  you can see whoever feels like answering one of the the conversations that's been floating around a
1055.04s:  lot is the idea of a holding company and different ways that that could look so from your perspectives
1064.32s:  trying to perceive what RC might be trying to configure obviously it's a guess nobody fully knows
1073.20s:  but looking at it from looking at the game from his perspective what do you guys think he might
1079.44s:  be trying to structure if he goes the route of a holding company what might that actually look like?
1087.28s:  Well Kevin I'm sure you could I'm not sure how much you can you can talk about this but you know
1093.12s:  there's a lot of there's a lot of conspiracy theories about what's going on and there's some evidence
1098.08s:  there's some like tangential evidence that seems to support some of the theories right there's
1102.08s:  just also not enough to fully confirm anything so we can't say for sure but one of the main ones is
1108.48s:  that he wants to create almost like a keritsu style you know business co-op that basically entails a
1120.64s:  central counterparty like a bank and I think he's already you can correct me if I'm wrong Kevin
1127.68s:  but I think he's already filed for Teddy uh Corp to be a bank um and you know the goal is to make
1135.68s:  have this entity be like a uh loaning institution for this group of companies that will work together
1142.48s:  synergistically to compete against Amazon um and this comes from the Japanese you know idea of
1148.80s:  a business uh that emerged in the wake of the 1940s after World War II as Japan was starting to rebuild
1156.48s:  these you know keritsu's were formed which were basically like uh formal
1161.84s:  collaborations between businesses to work together on pricing on um on you know like logistics
1170.16s:  transportation all those things so that the business could effectively compete with offshore
1175.52s:  entities in the US or in Europe and what this basically entailed is by the late 1980s right
1182.00s:  Japan was a much more developed economy than before they'd experienced the most rapid economic growth
1187.60s:  of any um country uh in the 1980s and they also saw you know unfortunately the developed development
1196.08s:  of a bubble but these business practices were fundamentally sound generally and they were adopted
1200.48s:  worldwide and so the theory is with his um you know with his creation of this Teddy bank entity
1210.72s:  and his loaning of of capital to uh bedbath and beyond and other um you know small little tidbits
1218.64s:  of information that we've been seeing um that he's trying to form a keritsu you know the other
1224.08s:  example is uh I don't remember the name of that company but there's an international shipping
1227.84s:  conglomerate uh the CEO um what does it call it I'm blanking on it Kevin it's uh yeah anyways
1237.36s:  what
1240.32s:  Zim Zim Zim is that the name of it okay but I think yes okay the CEO of that shipping company has also
1249.36s:  been um in conversation with Ryan Cohen and like why would Ryan Cohen be talking to an international
1256.56s:  logistics company if not for you know either acquisition or potential partnerships to
1262.56s:  get credit global competitor to amazon someone just said in the comments flex port
1268.80s:  yes that's it flex that's it yeah yeah shout out to you oh that's it itchy itchy go shout out to you
1278.00s:  so I gotta tell you man like the chat in the community is probably one of the coolest things about
1284.00s:  this whole thing cassettes that's how I found PB is they were like yo this other dude does a lot
1290.08s:  of this stuff you should talk to him and they've been on point so shout out for the for the heads
1296.00s:  up there um I don't know how much you can go in uh a response or answer your thoughts on that
1302.80s:  Kevin but I would love to hear your perspective as far as the holding company goes uh
1312.48s:  and the bank proven I I can't remember I I can't remember if it was tin foil or if it was real
1319.60s:  on the teddy bank so I'm just gonna leave it at that uh fire on his bank I do know that
1324.00s:  fire on his bank is almost impossible uh we saw so fire and other companies try and do it for a very
1331.28s:  long time to be an FDIC bank so a company not running I'm sure you can research it while I'm
1340.56s:  talking to see uh if there's answers on that uh but as far as holding company goes to my understanding
1348.96s:  and the wording on the earning reports over the last four quarters of marketable securities they
1354.40s:  can be a holding company they don't have to even switch over to teddy to do a game stock can buy
1361.52s:  birkshire and apple and google stock today and have it on their balance sheets um which
1368.40s:  would be a holding company you know can go on red uh I hate the word spec because of you know
1374.96s:  everything that happened but they have four point six billion dollars to deploy in any way that
1382.40s:  Ryan sees fit and he's not gonna do it in a ridiculous way you know he is a penny cruncher
1393.84s:  and I'm guessing besides or because nobody knows anything about him and he had no social media
1401.76s:  anything that probably works 120 hours a week like e-line too where his schedules are at five minute
1408.24s:  intervals and sleeps an hour a night so I feel like he's going into this number one is main goal
1415.92s:  with profitability and thinking the company number two is going to be either building out to maximize
1422.16s:  margins or buy out which I think you only do on dips from mergers and acquisitions or be a holding
1430.40s:  company for the backdoor to buy game stock on cycles for other companies that he sees fit or Bitcoin
1440.32s:  if he sees fit because now it's a marketable security so kind of a wide a wide ray of possibilities
1449.84s:  and I've seen a lot of people throwing out different configurations the the thing I'm really
1455.28s:  interested in is to understand the way that RC might be perceiving the landscape as it sits today
1462.96s:  and if one of those routes might look more appealing to him than some of the other routes again
1469.28s:  all conjecture we don't know but it's I think an interesting exercise to try to look at it from
1475.68s:  what he might be trying to roadmap out for the company because the way that I saw him originally
1481.76s:  raising again raising those funds companies when they're raising money like that it's typically for
1485.84s:  some sort of purpose not just the fact that it's exceedingly advantageous timing which it was
1491.20s:  imagine as he was doing that he probably had some ideas on you know what route he might want to
1496.64s:  take it now when you see game stop closing stores it starts to show at least some sort of
1505.20s:  underlying change in the theme do you guys think that the store closure is going to
1511.04s:  continue and it's going to be a really core bubble of just the really profitable brick and
1516.40s:  mortar stores to open up other business lines or do you guys see the brick and mortar element
1522.32s:  shifting in some sort of way potentially even expanding?
1528.72s:  Kevin you want to take that or I can take it?
1530.72s:  I'll go I see it as unprofitability if it was your own company and you have
1540.48s:  a hundred employees selling something if 30 of them have consistently lost money all the time
1548.24s:  I'd close them out until I became profitable as a whole and now you know he's probably thinking
1555.44s:  or gains on the entire board's probably thinking how many more do we close? I mean
1562.00s:  international is expensive and if it's not profitable and they're international it's probably a
1567.44s:  tough decision you know we're bringing out of a country like that's just like the magazine
1571.92s:  that they dropped with like 20 million subscribers I can guess that it wasn't making money
1577.92s:  because we know what a point to that so them cancel it was just to get as profitable as possible
1584.24s:  but now with the PSA partnership and I posted about this before now they have a GameStop store in
1594.00s:  almost every single city in the United States as far as like a big city not a small town where people
1600.80s:  can go get their cards graded and send a man and it's an instant profit for GameStop on these PSA
1610.96s:  so now I would believe that it's at a standpoint of whether to close stores or keep ones open in
1620.24s:  certain places where they see the PSA momentum growing the store is not profitable but they went
1629.36s:  from 10 cars the first month to 100 to 1000 within three months getting graded they might keep that
1635.60s:  one open if they saw no change in it and the profitable they'll probably be like okay let's close
1641.44s:  this one I think there'll be a lot more strategic with it same with Ryan going after shipping just
1647.12s:  like he did with Chewie he has a store in almost every big city with same day shipping if you want
1653.04s:  to pay for it so your PS5 can get delivered in three hours and so those are hubs across the entire
1660.40s:  United States in every single town imagine a mini Amazon hub with just a specific source of inventory
1669.20s:  that can be delivered to your house within a couple hours.
1674.80s:  Yeah and you know the other thing too is like and I think you know Kevin you've you've talked to Ian
1680.40s:  at length about this right and Ian does a really good job of laying this out that you know if you
1687.76s:  look at Ryan Cohen's backstory right he was born in Canada he you know he really spends a lot of
1696.56s:  time with his father and his family and for him like he you know gains a lot of lessons and and
1705.44s:  you know life advice from his dad and unfortunately his dad passes away but one of the things or
1711.36s:  a couple of things that his dad instilled in him was the value of hard work and honesty and integrity
1717.20s:  right and so that's how he approached Chewie so when he started Chewie you know well over a decade ago
1724.00s:  he wanted to take on Amazon because he felt that Amazon was starting to become predatory in their
1728.64s:  practices and especially especially with regards to pets and pet food so there were multiple and like
1735.92s:  the mid to late 2000s there were multiple outbreaks of E. coli or food poisoning with the pet food
1742.32s:  that Amazon was selling Amazon was not doing quality control from these suppliers in China and India
1748.08s:  and people's pets were getting a second die and Amazon didn't care because again they're
1752.64s:  you know by this time in you know 2010-2011 they're starting to run a you know multi-billion dollar
1757.44s:  business this is just one of the product lines they have a small team of people that in customer
1762.16s:  support for the pet food section and so they didn't really you know they didn't really care if
1767.84s:  people's pets were dying it's just a lawsuit you settle for a couple hundred grand and you just
1772.00s:  move on and Ryan was you know obviously in sense at this and he's been quoted in interviews as well
1778.32s:  as you know news pieces as saying like this was one of the motivators to tap to push him to start
1785.60s:  Chewie and so when he does start Chewie he makes it completely like it's like the polar opposite
1790.88s:  of what Amazon is he instead of focusing on bottom line profitability focuses on the customer
1795.52s:  customer satisfaction he believes that customer satisfaction will drive the bottom line
1800.40s:  you know not the other way around and so you know I mean this this carries through to him sending
1806.32s:  literally like they send out letters or notes to people when their pets pass away they can even send
1812.64s:  send out recurring birthday notes to people when they're if they've noticed that they're they've
1818.32s:  been buying from Chewie consistently and they have a birthday for their pet on the website they'll
1822.56s:  send out a birthday notice and I know people who've gotten that which again adds that personal
1827.44s:  touch and so you know in 2015 after Ryan Cohen had had sold Chewie and moved out you know of control
1835.04s:  of the company he was looking for a new investment he was just sitting on billions of dollars
1839.92s:  of capital just waiting to see what was next and what he saw was game stop being shorted you know
1847.12s:  we could save and you know criminally right like just excessively shorted and he saw that the
1853.76s:  board was just completely incompetent with the way that they were running the company they were
1858.72s:  overloaded and that there was a four hundred million dollar bond coming due in March of 2021
1863.36s:  and they had no plan to pay it and they had like less than 50 million in liquid cash and so he said
1868.64s:  look all this takes is for someone to come in refocus the business on what it used to do best
1874.80s:  and you know we can turn on this franchise around and he's been you know even despite the fact that
1881.20s:  a lot of people on twitter get angry at at how slow the progress has been he has been successful
1885.92s:  in you know making this thing profitable on a net basis and reducing overall expenses and so
1892.80s:  and it's not easy because running a company like games stop a legacy breaking mortar business in a
1898.00s:  e-commerce world is is difficult so you got to give him kudos for that and I think that
1904.88s:  you know if he if he is if he is genuinely getting interested in a co-op or a corretzo of some form
1912.56s:  it's going to be on the same with the same philosophy of customers first right he had a
1919.52s:  tweet that went viral that was you know protect women and children and I think at all or
1924.16s:  pets and children at all costs right and that's kind of his philosophy and so he views amazon as this
1930.40s:  predatory firm that's just destroyed the American you know retail segment and effectively
1939.04s:  gutted the American consumer because now they have fewer options it's just buy from amazon
1945.04s:  or don't or or nowhere because there's no other options and you know I think that that that relates
1952.56s:  to his overall strategy so I I think we're still in this limbo of waiting to see what he does with
1958.32s:  the cash because it's a huge amount of cash and he could do multiple things right he could literally
1962.32s:  buy multiple businesses and entire companies with this amount of cash so we're still waiting and
1968.80s:  but I think that we're I think that things are happening in the background that there's not
1974.56s:  able to allow us to be privy to yeah now one of the big elements I
1983.04s:  curious from specifically evaluation perspective from really uh both you guys again is turning around
1991.20s:  brick and mortar store keeping it at least on and profitable long enough to continue down the path
1996.32s:  is difficult doable with difficult and one of the the big tailwinds that I've kind of seen is just
2006.24s:  how supportive the game stock community is of game stock it's like next level there's not a lot of
2014.16s:  people that feel the way about amazon right like there's there's nobody from an investor standpoint
2021.20s:  and from a communal standpoint that's so stoked about amazon so what role do you think the community
2029.52s:  plays in the future direction of game stock because it has been a massive thing that's kept things
2038.80s:  afloat to a degree um to where we are now so do you think that's part of the consideration that might
2045.68s:  go into future business plans so taking it from the perspective of if you were RC how do you
2055.44s:  integrate the game stock community into future plans do you at all or do you kind of just focus
2061.60s:  on the business and hope that the community falls along I can I can I can talk about do you want to
2071.68s:  chat good okay yeah I don't want to take all the airtime but um you know in corporate finance
2076.96s:  there's something and and you know Kevin you might know about this but there's something called
2080.56s:  the dividend clientele effect which is um you know the study that whenever a company starts the issue
2087.20s:  dividends on a consistent basis and if they're able to continually support that dividend uh a
2093.12s:  strong base of retail investors as well as institutional but but investors become
2097.76s:  hotlers for lack of a better term of their stock and so if the company continues to promote dividends
2103.84s:  and to give dividends to the shareholders these shareholders will come in and they'll buy
2109.20s:  um through bull and bear markets through cycles through economic catastrophe through what have you
2115.52s:  because they believe that they can get continual benefits from from holding the stock right in the
2120.00s:  phone of these dividends and that creates these very strong hands that are much more hard to
2125.52s:  shake out of the market than than we can's right there's tons of studies showing that for example
2131.20s:  companies with a with a dividend clientele um have much less much lower ratios of uh short interest
2139.20s:  and they also are much less um much less often the targets of short attacks because again it's
2145.20s:  just harder to shake when we have all these people that are holding on to the company and holding
2149.44s:  on to these dividends harder for them to to be shaken off of holding the stock and the same
2154.72s:  thing i'd say is true of uh of of games obviously like there's a very very huge retail contingent
2164.48s:  of investors who have bought shares and they're essentially never never selling which is why you
2169.04s:  kind of see these price cycles move the way they do you see spikes in price from a gamma or even
2176.00s:  like a mini short squeeze then we see a retracement and it comes back down to a to a hard level where
2181.60s:  just will not go below you know whether that's $20 post split now in 2024 or whether that was
2188.96s:  you know $4 free split uh in 2020 like there are there are these levels where it's like
2194.88s:  there's just this hard wall of buyers that cannot be exhausted and so that's why big that's why
2201.12s:  I'm sorry GME is for example so hard to chart is because like it just doesn't act like a normal stock
2207.28s:  but those you know that retail investor segment buy a lot of measures and again it's hard to actually
2212.48s:  get the exact number but by a lot of measures is probably the largest as a percent of the company's
2218.56s:  float of any company in history so it is recording as you look at the rest data yeah yeah it's
2225.76s:  the highest yeah absolutely so i was just saying that because i was like maybe there's some
2231.60s:  company out there that i don't know about that's fucking you know sorry sorry it is the highest above
2236.24s:  a billion dollar market cap because there was a couple that tried to do it on extremely
2241.28s:  micros to try and prove crime but as far as a billion dollar company or profitable company they are
2248.64s:  the highest percentage of float that are direct registered in individual investor names
2255.76s:  yeah and that's around what 25% or so yeah and the one exception right is like global links
2262.48s:  with robber since in 2005 where you bought like 100 limp percent the flow and dres did but
2266.88s:  that was yeah that was a sub like 30 million market cap company but yeah for the majority of
2274.32s:  you know of companies they've never seen an effect like this and so the retail segments
2279.84s:  oh probably over you know 800,000 holders across multiple nations and they're all supporting it not
2286.24s:  only by buying the stock and holding it but by actively going out and buying items like game
2291.92s:  stock like there's giveaways there's tons of people on twitter i know hotchi does does give
2296.72s: aways of gift cards i think you've done that to Kevin uh for your events yeah yeah there's people
2302.80s:  who give away the playing cards and basically they that means they go and they buy like a thousand
2307.04s:  dollars worth of it and then give it away on twitter or fund razor um and yeah there's just there's a
2313.44s:  level of support here that has never been seen before in corporate finance like ever it's they
2320.72s:  there'll be history books written about this for sure what do i have the things i found
2326.96s:  speaking of support is i part of what i started doing i got to move the chat out of the way so i can
2334.00s:  share part of my screen is the community actually introduced me to this document um i don't know
2343.52s:  if you guys can see but it's it's called the diamond handbook um and it's a pretty comprehensive
2352.88s:  list of gme theories and we've been going through literally every single one of them and i think
2361.12s:  we're close to a little over halfway through like we're in like over page 400 or so one of the
2367.76s:  common themes that i've come across as i've been prusing through all this documentation looking up
2372.40s:  the source documents and whatnot is this is become a massive interest of mine because gamestop
2380.08s:  has become the vector through the ape community that has identified a lot of underlying stuff
2391.60s:  that looks really interesting from a regulatory standpoint and what i mean by that is you
2398.08s:  could probably read in between the lines is it looks like there's a lot of fuckery going on
2402.96s:  everything from dtcc down to fin refines and stuff like that so i wanted to to ask you both
2411.84s:  your perspectives of the roles of these larger financial institutions around something like
2421.12s:  gamestop specifically people that how they get involved and what their motivations might be
2428.24s:  for how they get involved Eric you pointed out absolutely perfectly and i said this on
2438.88s:  almost everyone on this face calls i've ever done the best thing from the January game stop
2445.76s:  saga sneeze in my opinion is that there's more than a million people now that looked
2453.36s:  that looked for corruption and data every single day against the people at the top
2462.48s:  and post it instantly to multiple social media sites but millions that have gotten screwed between
2471.92s:  OG AMC when it was in the basket and then tlp that bat there's so many people that are just trying to
2482.32s:  that probably created some of those docs that you have in there highlighted that before
2488.80s:  January 21 might not have ever invested before or had an index fund or something and so the best
2496.24s:  thing that came from that is that many people try and expose crime every single day
2501.60s:  like they they all thought at the top the retail would go away and forget about it
2508.96s:  and they didn't like all these people are in different communities doing this famous act
2513.92s:  thing every single day as they were 40 months ago and they can't hide like eventually they have
2522.32s:  to file things and there's people way smarter than me programming and algos for notifications that are
2530.08s:  getting these finna and scc fileings loaded insulator computer and posting them across the entire world
2536.72s:  about what's happening and i think that is the absolutely cool thing
2543.12s:  yeah it's like the biggest like crowd you know almost like a crowdfunded financial research community
2550.56s:  in history like they're they're literally has never been anything like that and again i i was on
2556.80s:  you know the reddit boards in jenny of 2021 and again i used to work at a private equity
2561.44s:  fintech firm and there were people that were you know active traders at my company that we're
2566.64s:  looking at it there were people that were options traders commodity traders um i met people
2572.08s:  through this community who are mathematicians wealth managers right portfolio managers bankers
2578.72s:  there's old man repo who's a former manager of a repo desk at a big bank like there's all these people
2587.04s:  that have just come out of the woodwork and done research and started saying like you know what is
2591.04s:  actually going on because the game's not phenomenon is so like puzzling to the financial establishment
2597.84s:  because it just bucks every single traditional trend right we we saw the beginning of this
2603.44s:  squeeze play out in january and you know people were in the lead up to to like the zenith right
2611.12s:  there people were starting to get you know more and more agitated with the amount of propaganda
2616.56s:  from the media saying that the squeeze was over that you should go home don't buy the stock you don't
2620.96s:  need to own it um and then with the robinhood shutting off the buy button as well as 182 retail
2626.96s:  brokers um there was just a mass outrage at at the system and so people that started putting out the
2634.56s:  meme right like they turn off the buy button we turn off the cell button like i don't care about
2639.44s:  money anymore i just want to hold this stock and and show the system that this is not okay
2644.56s:  and so that's become almost like the calling card of the community right we're we're not only
2650.24s:  you know looking for for wealth and for capital gains we want to see real change in the
2655.12s:  financial system in the way that things are structured now because it's clearly unsustainable
2659.20s:  there's so many companies that can make it shorted so many companies that that suffer from FDs
2664.00s:  and you know we've seen through the saga we've seen the proliferation of like education at every
2669.44s:  level of finance so you know there were people looking into FD cycles and how the continuous net
2676.08s:  settlement system works that are people looking into the ETFs like you know we found that
2682.00s:  I mean just in what June of those year I did a DDD on the ETFs and one of the biggest ETFs that
2688.00s:  holds GMME which is XRT which is the spider retail ETF has been on the SEC threshold list for
2695.36s:  shorting for like 1400 days and so how can an ETF be on the threshold list for 1400 days and nobody
2703.76s:  investigates what's going on and so like these kinds of questions started to get raised and for
2709.12s:  the first time right there's a massive retail push to to get change across and we pressured
2715.12s:  Gary Gensler we pressured other SEC officials to change and I think there's like been more education
2723.04s:  than anything that we could have ever dreamed about that has that has proliferated across you know
2730.40s:  the globe basically literally cannot second that more it's been one of the funnest parts for me
2738.00s:  it's like I said I've been training for a long time but I have learned so much about market structure
2745.28s:  micro structure and relationships through GameStop that literally never would have crossed my
2751.12s:  mind previously because my job is to look at options throw some numbers around and essentially make
2756.64s:  a guess and so I normally just do that and as I started looking at a lot of the GameStop stuff and
2763.28s:  what they're pointing out it's like wait a minute like there's there's actually some really
2766.64s:  interesting things going on here that do not seem to make sense to me or they do not seem to be
2772.08s:  fully up aboard which leads me to a natural follow on question because you mentioned some of the
2778.88s:  the short side and actors from that perspective do you guys think that there are still legacy
2786.48s:  shorts open from the original squeeze that have just been moved into different financial
2792.56s:  instruments and perpetuated or do you think that those have been satisfied now and it might be a
2798.96s:  new group of shorts no absolutely absolutely I think there's still shorts stuck here I mean if you
2805.92s:  read and again like this might sound for a lot of people like a you know forechand conspiracy theory
2811.76s:  but you read the house financial services committee own report on GameStop like 182 pages I read the
2818.48s:  whole thing and you know what they say in their own words they say according to our analysis of
2824.48s:  internal SEC data this was not a short squeeze shorts never shorts were never the majority volume
2829.76s:  in this in this in this squeeze it was just retail buying and gamma hedging that was it like 2021
2836.16s:  was not the end that 120 140 percent some brokers you know Finder at one point was printing 260
2843.52s:  Ian Carroll sent me one at 313 percent short interest right none of that was fully closed by the
2850.40s:  by the house financial services committee own report and so if they weren't able to close in 2021
2856.80s:  like how are they able to close now without causing causing the the prices spike and so we you know
2862.16s:  we've we've tracked them using swaps and derivatives and other instruments to just move their
2867.44s:  obligations forward and just try to kick the can continually and you know archa goes was also
2872.80s:  an example of that right like gme was named dropped in the archa goes lawsuit when they collapsed
2878.88s:  and there's also evidence you know tangential evidence from archa goes is excess capital premium
2884.56s:  charges which are the charges that are are assigned to them by the nscc is like basically their
2890.96s:  liability for their stock portfolio and you see like their excess capital premium spikes and forms
2897.84s:  the exact pattern of gme in late January early february of 2021 and they blew up in march of 2021
2905.28s:  and so like the evidence is there that it it wasn't just right tin foil comes through to the
2912.72s:  area that these shorts and clothes and that they use derivatives and swaps or total return swaps
2917.36s:  to to try to hedge exposure they were actually doing this now the question is how many other
2923.04s:  shorts are author that are still open we don't know and it's going to be really hard to know because
2927.04s:  again and i think Kevin can expand more on this right they've changed how they calculate short
2930.96s:  interests so that they can't go above 100% ever again so the formulas have been changed yeah and i
2936.88s:  also think you you highlight another thing so i spent a while to because again derivatives is kind
2941.68s:  of like what i do it's like the only thing i know anything about and the the tricky part with
2947.52s:  something like swaps is there you can get details on them but a lot of them are black boxes
2953.20s:  understanding the specific terms of them are are difficult now it that leads to a follow-on question
2959.60s:  though which is with some of the at the markets and new shares being offered shorts would have been
2968.96s:  given several opportunities to finally take an exit at not blow-up levels still uncomfortable
2976.64s:  still they're gonna eat the launch but not necessarily go through implosion so then
2982.96s:  why maintain the cost of carrying the shorts is it you think they're approaching it from the
2990.96s:  this is in eventuality where this thing is going to roll over and go out of business and if so
2998.16s:  most of them are going to be using Bayesian models which as a company starts to acquire several
3003.60s:  billion dollars in free cash the probability of that business going out of business in the near
3010.72s:  term starts to become less likely so then do you think that might influence their future decision
3018.24s:  to continue maintaining the shorts or not can't have been do you want to answer that or i can
3024.08s:  tackle it too yeah i got it let's go i that was a serious question there i
3033.04s:  well good i have nothing prepared so i'm just going off the dome i'm hoping this stuff isn't terrible
3037.84s:  no no it was amazing i i'm just trying to remember the points from it so when it comes to
3045.36s:  shorts and clothes for the input it perfectly they even said it since then
3053.68s:  i do believe there's a massive position in archaegos bag because everyone that touches it goes bankrupt
3062.88s:  and someone's holding that and i posted about it yesterday but i haven't found any
3067.52s:  answers i haven't been on ex yet today but i posted the the reports post it came out on friday for
3074.16s:  ubs or what they're holding in their bag from credit suites and then someone in the comments said
3080.56s:  that they put it switzerland said there's going to be archive for 50 years before it gets released
3087.60s:  and so i have not deep-dive that i'm sure prove you it's not going to be able to sleep because of
3093.28s:  that comment and trying to figure out which one of those two before tomorrow morning that would be
3098.32s:  epic if it comes out finally but i think the position got too big on the basket to close
3107.84s:  for the market maker swaps financial instruments or as hedge funds go they could have closed at
3114.64s:  any time because like you said the at-the-money offerings but that's the worst time because
3122.40s:  retail sitting by almost ungodly high in volume when those offerings have come out but
3130.48s:  market makers proved in may when 500 million shares traded
3139.44s:  and we know it wasn't like people selling that they can get out at any time as far as small shorts
3149.28s:  like if they were shorted you know a hundred million a hedge fund not a market maker or someone
3155.84s:  with tens of billions of dollars of securities sold not yet purchased but they had the liquidity
3161.60s:  last four years during the run ups and the cycles and the hype and roaring kitty and all these
3167.84s:  to get out of it they didn't they were going to cause buying fresh right that retail is already
3172.40s:  doing that and by the time we see Friday's market close it's back down to max paying and everyone
3177.36s:  got screwed because it went up 50% drop 40% within a week so they can they could have gotten out as far
3184.88s:  as a hedge fund goes um i want everyone watching to also separate hedge fund just like a small office
3193.52s:  or you know even a big office billion a couple billion assets first market makers with
3198.88s:  trillions of dollars of orders that come through every single day that they are allowed to legally
3204.96s:  counterfeit shares and go try and find them and if they can't they put them into different
3210.40s:  derivatives trade between each other all these other things and so I do believe they could have
3216.32s:  gotten out of it liquidity was there based on market makers except exception to create liquidity for
3225.92s:  everyone during those cycles on the bidnask there's no way 50 mil or 500 million shares sold in May
3234.80s:  from retail investors right synthetic they were going to have to be delivered and then we saw
3241.60s:  the jewel run up right after it again what do you guys think the the current positioning is then
3249.52s:  for start maybe market maker side of things and then hedge fund high-frequency would whatever
3257.28s:  other you want to buck into that institutional component do you guys think that if you were to divvy
3262.24s:  up the current shorts that may or may not be out there where do you think they live as a percentage
3267.36s:  wise between the entities I mean it's so this is where it's hard to parse it out right because
3274.64s:  again some of the swap data shows you know wildly different different figures but you know we
3281.28s:  looked at in 2021 obviously there was the infamous Brazilian puts which were actually found by
3288.16s:  Lawson who's a finance professor very smart guy at a Bloomberg terminal he found this subsidiary
3295.28s:  of credit suites in Brazil that held 80% of the float of game stop in deep into money calls as well
3304.24s:  as puts are out of the money puts and so the question is like why does this credit suites subsidiary
3310.48s:  have 80% of the float in like call options basically like what what are they doing and when he reached
3317.60s:  out and asked them what's what was going on a day later the data was erased from the Bloomberg
3322.88s:  terminal and the support team told him oh that was a data error that you should see that again don't
3328.64s:  worry about it and he's like whoa whoa whoa he's like he's never seen that before right that there's
3333.92s:  a data error quote-unquote of this but that was 80% of the float with a single entity and now credit
3340.56s:  suites was a prime broker prime broker for like dozens and dozens of hedge funds right that were
3345.20s:  short game stop archigos being one of them there's also a smaller hedge fund that was following along
3350.88s:  archigos' footsteps I don't have their name confirmed yet but Dario who's another banker and
3357.76s:  finance guy who's right it's on twitter he he shared with me in our podcast that we did last
3363.52s:  June that there was a couple other hedge funds that he knows personally have were were in on the
3368.56s:  game stop trade and that we're trying to swap to get out of the short obligations and so if one
3375.60s:  prime broker which may even be the largest prime broker that was facilitating shorts against
3380.08s:  game stop but it or swaps against game stop if they were 8% of float then what were the others I
3385.44s:  mean had probably around 120 140% at least and the swaps that we saw rolling over this summer that
3392.40s:  we're contributing to the price action were also around I mean some of these were massive they were
3397.68s:  like in terms of share count some of them were 20% of the float in a single swap rolling over
3403.12s:  over the course of a week and that was just from the data that we could scrape together from
3408.40s:  like the cftc and so if you know it's hard to give you a hard number on like how many
3414.64s:  shorts are still out there but I would say well over 100% of the float is probably still short
3419.76s:  and prove it and it's of the entities that have shorted though like splitting between market makers
3426.24s:  and hedge funds other kinds of shops out institutions do you think most of the short float whatever
3433.52s:  the total number is most of that is with the market making side of things do you think that it's within
3439.60s:  the hedge fund side of things or do you think it's 50 50 split the reason why I asked the question
3444.24s:  is because the impact of the market and the way things would move would vary quite a bit based on
3450.08s:  which of those conditions it might be so that's the premise I think it's mostly moved to the
3457.20s:  derivative side of the hedge fund book personally I mean the market makers right they're much more agile
3462.48s:  and they also have many more loopholes to work with in terms of kicking the can down the road and
3466.72s:  so they don't even have to really use swaps in the same way that like a hedge fund or a private
3472.64s:  family office would have to have to do they can use just the market maker exemption and continually
3478.64s:  kick the can and so it's it's much easier like you said it's much easier for you know structurally
3485.04s:  for a market maker to avoid actually making good on the promises in the form of stock loans
3491.76s:  for long periods of time and so I think that market makers have largely probably cleared out
3495.84s:  their excessive obligations and it just rests on the swap side for hedge funds and banks.
3504.00s:  Who's thinking Kevin your thoughts?
3507.20s:  Prove in do you think the swap rover at the end of spring the May June swap rover
3516.40s:  cause the price action so you've seen every quad witching and swap rover for four years right
3525.52s:  and how many came true with a big bump up zero would you not contribute that to Rohingya
3530.32s:  Kitty at the time I would obviously for May right and then June would have been my presumption
3537.20s:  sorry catch you off would be the T-35 on other firms and kind of just an entire week of
3544.32s:  erotaire two months of him tweeting stuff compared to that swap finally causing something because
3555.20s:  how many had it? Yeah yeah that's that's that's accurate but if you look at Richard Newton's
3561.68s:  some of his work like he's tracked it back to 2020 2021 and you know again it's it's kind of like
3568.56s:  it's kind of like what you say like some of the swaps roll over and they're they're they're
3572.64s:  they're large and then the price barely moves to have a few percent or flat and then other times
3579.44s:  there's a swap rollover and the price goes absolutely ballistic and so my theory is that you know
3585.04s:  May and June were particularly large swap rollovers as well as actually November and December that
3592.08s:  we have we didn't swap rollover who would be looking to tweet when they saw the swap extra big
3599.12s:  yeah roaring kitty and so and and this would also kind of answer right if he understands the swap
3604.40s:  cycles this well and like their their obligation cycles and when they actually have to hedge like
3611.20s:  you this under this could explain why he came back with what was it like triple or quadruple the
3617.12s:  amount of cash that he left with in 2021 because he disappeared in 2021 with like you know what was
3623.20s:  it was it 80,000 shares or 800 that was 800,000 shares I think and it came back with 5 million
3630.72s:  something like that post blit and so it's like he five x more than five x his position
3636.64s:  and everyone was like wait like roaring kitty has a quarter of a million dollars or billion dollars
3641.68s:  like he has 200 million like what how did he grow like he's now the size of a of a private family
3649.84s:  office or hedge fund like a mid size one like he's starting to get up there and so yeah I don't
3656.88s:  think it's unresumable to to expect that he he understood this and you know there there is some
3663.04s:  evidence right like if you look at the swap cycles there were much more consistent in 2021 then they
3668.56s:  were in 2022 and 2023. So 2024 we had swap rollovers rollovers in March and April that were small
3676.48s:  to mid size that didn't have any impact on price and then we had we actually did have a big
3681.28s:  really big one at the end of May and then a really big one in early June and rollover kitty's tweets
3686.80s:  were exactly timed with the expiration of those swaps and I don't know if you know finance
3692.24s:  lot on twitter but finance lot was another guy who's like a trend follower and chart analyst and
3697.60s:  financial analyst and he took I he asked me for the FDD and the swap dad and I sent it to him and
3705.20s:  after looking at it for like a day he said rolling kitty's next tweet is going to be June 3rd and he's
3710.08s:  like right before he's like he's like if you look at the pattern that's what he's going to do and I
3714.40s:  I thought it sounds like no I'm like I think he finished tweeting in May the price went back down
3719.04s:  I still hold on to my I bought some more shares but I'm like just just chilling here and then
3724.08s:  you know what came to pass June 3rd he starts tweeting again and then the price subtracting again
3729.12s:  and so I think again I think he probably is playing cycles and he knows about them and they're
3733.44s:  probably exacerbating his moves but I absolutely I think that he he's having an impact on price
3739.12s:  obviously I mean there's probably alga goes out there that are smashed buying Bitcoin every time
3744.64s:  he tweets because they're just trying to front run retail liquidity. We saw it two weeks ago
3749.84s:  yeah yeah on the airplane definitely a million share of purchase within seconds yep of his tweet
3756.96s:  and that's why he tweeted at him too I was like why don't you just do this like late on a Friday as well
3764.16s:  it's not market manipulation to tweet a picture of a high five or something or just say hi
3770.64s:  and then to lee instantly the alga is going to buy a million shares and the options are going to go
3775.04s:  from a penny to a dollar within seconds with absolutely no market manipulation you didn't buy those
3781.68s:  shares so what else did on it and then he decided to ignore me and then do the same exactly
3788.64s:  on Monday morning after that with the 109 and 420 tweet that he had was three days later I was like
3799.28s:  cycle theory so fascinating to me because I've done a ton of research and trying to regress it
3806.48s:  to see if I can identify an actual trigger based on the swaps and I think one of the issues with it
3814.40s:  or having any efficacy is that we don't know how they settle and we don't know what the
3820.96s:  requirement is from settlement because they can always just make a new one and they can change the
3828.64s:  contents of it so the we one of the series that we did actually on the live streams that we typically
3835.52s:  do on Saturday which is game stop specific is we we literally went through every single one of
3842.64s:  roaring kiddies yolo tweets and I made an entire tracker for every single trade he put on
3848.64s:  what the account value was changes in account value and what the positions that he put on to get a
3854.96s:  sense of his trading style because I was actually really surprised that when I went all the way
3861.12s:  to the beginning that he started with all options which was very surprising to me because from the
3867.36s:  communities I don't know from like the the sense I get from a lot of the community seems like
3873.04s:  options were like a bad thing like you weren't supposed to talk about them they were telling me
3877.20s:  and stuff like that which was interesting so and have you guys done specific research on not
3886.00s:  just the swaps that we think might have led to price movement but just swaps impact broadly across
3893.28s:  all of them and the reason I ask it is just because one of the things I notice when I look at
3898.24s:  the game stop community is people do tend to have a bit of a confirmation bias data mining where we
3904.56s:  have something that we want to see is true and we go looking for that and I have a stats background
3910.64s:  so a big part of what we typically would do is look for the the other side right like a broad analysis
3918.08s:  and I'm so fascinated by the broader research around swaps because of how nebulous they are
3923.92s:  so to summarize that really long thought into a succinct question I'm wondering if you guys have
3928.32s:  done like specific research on the swaps as an entire group to see market impact and if so
3934.88s:  are there specific trends that we found like certain exploration swaps or certain entities
3940.56s:  in the swaps or anything like that so that's a really good question I really love the caveats
3945.60s:  you give there because I don't know if you watched my swap videos on game stop I did back in June
3952.08s:  but I said the exact same thing I was like look guys I would love it if they if I could perfectly
3957.60s:  predict game stop price movement from these swaps but the caveat that I gave obviously was the
3962.72s:  problem with these instruments is that because of the opacity of the counterparties we don't know
3967.44s:  how much is hedged and so if you have a total return swap where you have a prime broker and a hedge fund
3973.04s:  and the hedge fund says I want to get exposure I want to get synthetic exposure you know short
3977.84s:  exposure to game stop but I don't want to actively go out and short the shares can you do that for me
3982.88s:  and then I'll you know set up this swap where I'll pay you a fixed interest rate above prime
3988.08s:  and give up these other socks as collateral and then you can basically give me exposure and pay me
3992.48s:  anytime game stop you know collapses the prime broker could either hedge their position 100%
4000.48s:  they could hedge their position 50% they could hedge their position 0% like no no one knows
4006.24s:  and so because that data is not available the problem with these swaps is that some of the swaps
4011.36s:  can be huge we're talking billions of dollars they can come up and if they were fully hedged
4016.56s:  on expiry or if they get rolled over they just roll over and then nothing happens to the price
4021.76s:  because the the prime broker right the hedging entity in this case never actually has to go out
4026.88s:  and buy the shares to you know cover a liability because a they they already have them or be they
4032.88s:  can just roll it over and so when we look at when we look at the like the actual swap data it's
4040.88s:  it's very important to be mindful that you know as much as you want to be like so hit the
4045.68s:  hopian pipe and say hey this is this is an absolute guarantee of where the price will go in the next
4051.76s:  you know two one month two month three months here's the times when it will spike buy options right
4057.04s:  before sell at the top then buy puts let let the short short it back down and then you'll just profit
4062.56s:  if I had that money making machine I wouldn't be here talking to you guys unfortunately I'd probably
4066.16s:  be on a beach into heady uh sitting around with millions of dollars and so um yeah they're not
4073.68s:  like these cycles are not uh they're not predictive enough to actually make make movements on
4079.76s:  now what is really interesting about the swaps is there there's a couple things so first is that
4085.76s:  almost all the swaps are not peer uh what you call like a peer total return swap which is
4091.76s:  where they're based on a single security they're almost always portfolio swaps or basket swaps
4098.40s:  so what the entity is doing is they're not just shorting game stop they're shorting a basket of
4102.96s:  stocks and then they're also hedging it with longs that are another basket of different stocks and
4107.60s:  this is exactly what Bill Hwang did so if you use him as an example right he created total yeah
4114.08s:  he created total return swaps which were basket swaps which were long viacom paramount and then
4120.48s:  a bunch of Chinese stocks and then he was short game stop AMC and a bunch of retailers that he thought
4126.32s:  were gonna go down in 2020 you know 2019 2020 in 2021 and so the problem that he ran into and why he
4133.84s:  got like his capital got just absolutely destroyed so quickly like he lost I think what eight billion
4139.28s:  dollars in a single day is because not only did his shorts uh in his swap his swap move against him
4146.96s:  his longs also did so viacom paramount all those stocks had entered bubble territory in in you know
4152.88s:  February of 2021 and they all started correcting hard and he got margin cold on both ends of the
4158.48s:  swap and he could not obviously uh cough up the collateral because he leveraged his firm something
4163.68s:  like eight or nine to one on on the base equity and so you know he was just blowing up and then now
4170.80s:  there's this huge toxic bag of of liabilities that the banks have right all these shorts on
4177.44s:  companies that were that are are racing higher like gm e i don't know exactly the his short
4183.52s:  position amount but given on the excess capital premium right he probably entered around
4188.16s:  $10 $20 and the price was $300 in 2021 and so he was deeply short on his gm e shorts
4195.52s:  they are deeply underwater and then his viacom paramount stocks were were down like 30% in the
4200.96s:  space of two months and so he was just obliterated now these banks are holding these liabilities and
4206.00s:  they have to figure out what to do so um yeah it's been a long story short like was interesting
4211.52s:  I haven't done a deep deep dive on the you know like analyzing oh is our total return swaps better
4217.68s:  at you know maybe slightly better predicting price you know do they have a point two correlation
4222.56s:  with price and the uh portfolio swaps have a point one correlation with price like is there any
4228.32s:  relationship there I haven't gone that deep into the data yet but I do know that from my look of it
4233.84s:  it was never a single uh a single gm e swap that was just pure gm e was always basket or total return
4241.84s:  or total portfolio swaps um and they almost always had the long end of the swap uh either
4248.48s:  denominated USD or euros and they were also holding you know large cap us stocks as as like collateral
4255.44s:  so it was like when I looked at it it was apple, Microsoft, Tesla, things like that like things
4262.16s:  and infinity out to like things that they expected to continually go up do you do you have like a
4268.48s:  reliable source for as comprehensive of a data set of the swaps because I only have pieces of it
4275.52s:  and I haven't found something that I fully trust but if either of you do I literally
4281.44s:  is weird as this is to say verbally I would love to do the analysis on it because like I love
4287.36s:  looking at this stuff I just haven't found like a solid data source yet that like I fully trust
4292.96s:  that it's comprehensive enough to be able to walk away with conclusions. Sure I mean I have like
4299.44s:  here I can even let me pull it up I still have the old gm e master archive as well as
4305.44s:  W super helpful and then in the meantime for for those hanging out in the chat first
4309.68s:  thanks for coming in taking it with us talking about game stop a little bit uh a big reason why
4315.04s:  I think game stop is super cool is because it connects people from lots of different backgrounds
4320.40s:  right like even the the group that we have here and for me I will always be a trader and a big part
4327.04s:  of what I try to do is objectively analyze things so that's actually what I hope to do with some
4332.48s:  of the swaps is to be able to just literally regress it and then see what actually shows because my
4339.60s:  guess is that there might be so I don't think swaps writ large I haven't found really predictive
4345.76s:  qualities around that yet but one of my further guess is that some of the sub qualities of the
4352.40s:  swaps might be predictive but I don't have a large enough data set that I trust enough yet.
4358.96s:  Yeah absolutely I mean I've gotten was it Linux and then what's the name of the other there's
4367.44s:  another guy on Twitter who was able to scrape the data for me and send it to me. Yeah I can
4373.20s:  hit you up and see see what we can get and then for those in the chat if there's anything in
4377.92s:  particular that you want to ask any of the dudes you could start throwing them in now we probably
4382.24s:  have like maybe 10-15 minutes or so I don't want to take too much of these guys this time but as always
4386.24s:  I'm stoked to chat with you guys while you guys are thinking oh sorry I can show you if you want
4392.88s:  to look at the swap data right now I can I can share the screen yeah we'd love to sure
4398.24s:  so let me make sure I'm sharing the right screen just a second oh no let us see the other screen
4403.68s:  let us see the screen with all the gramblins yeah I want to know what your sources are I want to know
4411.28s:  yeah let's get through that search history yeah well no my searchers is pretty boring
4420.00s:  but yeah so for us three you want to you want to learn about you know the history of central
4426.80s:  banking and you know all the yeah how to monetize a YouTube channel that's those are my two main
4433.52s:  searches and how far back does this go so okay so like this one goes back to 2020 I believe 2022
4443.92s:  it looks like I see 19 in my let me what's concave we don't want to spend too much time on this
4451.04s:  because I can parse through this execution execution time stamp so when the swap was actually executed
4457.36s:  yeah okay yeah but again like this is initiator or clothes when you mean executed yeah executed means
4464.40s:  initiated I believe yeah yeah because so some of these what's so interesting is like some of
4470.00s:  these will show like I actually was able to dig through the data and for some reason my other
4475.44s:  excel file where actually like broke this all down all got corrupted so I like I had this all
4480.64s:  organized to make it look really good and so you could understand it but in June but when I
4485.84s:  reopened it was like gone and so I was like oh shit so this is like the original file but um so
4492.08s:  what you can see with some of these like what's really interesting is some of these will be callbacks
4496.96s:  and again you'd have like scroll all the way through this to find which ones are like that but um
4503.36s:  some of these are like callbacks where you'll see like the execution time stamp you know and the
4510.96s:  event time stamp be different so it'll be you know like a basically like the event happens on you
4518.16s:  know let's say like January of 2021 like January 5th and then you'll see basically like a callback
4524.96s:  to another swap so it rolls over and says January 5th 2022 and says executed and then and then some
4530.56s:  of these will lack um lack a you know lack some of these time stamps so those ones are sometimes the
4539.92s:  like if they're like increased or termination they're sometimes like mismatched because you see that
4545.44s:  like they're basically being rolled over they're being canceled or they're being swapped for something
4549.20s:  else um but the data is hard to parse out because again it's been hard to find people like okay these
4555.68s:  are examples where these are like corrected ones right so these are corrected swaps so there's no
4559.60s:  event time stamp but there's an execution time stamp so you know that like these are older swaps
4564.96s:  and the as you can see here I'll zoom in these are all basket right basket swaps up here it was all
4572.72s:  oh oops that's too much up here it was all equity uh it was contract for difference I believe
4578.96s:  yeah so look at that these are all contract for difference so C of Ds are uh kind of similar to
4586.80s:  um single stock swaps and that they're just like you basically get paid on the performance of a
4592.40s:  security and not uh you don't actually have exposure real exposure to the underlying but what's
4597.76s:  hard about this right is I you know I've worked in finance but I've never seen data like this
4602.72s:  and I've reached out to people on Twitter and there's no one that's willing to help me like
4607.04s:  understand exactly what all these uh what all these things mean um yeah but yeah I probably in the
4613.60s:  last guy to help you understand what it means but what I can do is very easily identify relationships
4619.84s:  between these things and movements which again I'm I'm the village idiot now it's like I'm trying
4626.88s:  to trade so if I can find stuff that leads me to tradable ideas that that's how I prime my brain
4632.00s:  but honestly as I'm going through a joking aside I can probably parse through a bit of this um so
4637.76s:  yeah if you don't mind I'd love to get a copy of this from you and then I can start start running
4643.12s:  through what I have but I think we'll be able to at least understand yeah or nay um just different
4649.68s:  qualities of this and then subsequent impact because another thing is all of you know when analyzing
4654.96s:  something like the stock market it's really difficult because it's multi-variant so even if there's
4658.64s:  some sort of correlation between this coming up in some degree and then price movement there
4665.28s:  also can be other stuff at least the price movement so what I do is I keep a track of like all key
4670.16s:  events so that I can overlap like is there a news event that happened to come on that day as well
4674.56s:  so that we can try to actually get to a decent the decent answer so yeah so through this yes so this
4681.12s:  is exactly what I was talking about so you see the contract for differences are like those are
4684.56s:  like the single entity swaps that are all this gm e and the dot dot n tends for NYSE for North America
4692.00s:  so it's like a denominator that shows like this is literally American gm e stock because there's
4696.00s:  gm e that trades in Europe or in other other countries but when we get down to the basket or
4701.44s:  portfolio swaps you can see here like the long end of the this is the what's it called
4708.80s:  I should be a new I'm like stands for a New York Stock Exchange what new stands for New York Stock
4715.92s:  Exchange and and stands for NYSE yeah New York Stock Exchange that's that's what I was told by
4723.28s:  someone who's who's traded you know derivatives before they're like oh yeah that's a denominator
4728.80s:  that helps the it's like an internal back end thing to make sure that they know it's that for
4734.08s:  NYSE not gm e on another exchange we can see here like look you see the underlying like one AMC
4741.44s:  Chipotle coin base I don't know what DT is I don't know what N is but five in OQ gm e or the N is the
4752.96s:  sorry that's obviously the gm e dot in proven we can't see what you're on right now yeah
4759.20s:  yeah you're on termination right now wait really yeah it's like a share in part of your screen
4768.24s:  wait let me try to share we could see the cursor now you see the cursor going but whatever screen
4773.84s:  you're on that's why I was asking about the new because you were on new when he said new
4778.08s:  there you can see this now yeah you see it okay yeah put it on a letter on a letter
4784.88s:  are you on the right side of an end no I'm just making sure your cursor is in the right spot
4789.68s:  yeah so you're gm e dot n yeah so these are so yeah for a large part of the spreadsheet these are
4796.00s:  these contract for differences which are these like again similar to a single swap a single equity
4802.88s:  swap but when we get to the portfolio swap sort of the basket swaps you can see here so it's
4808.40s:  AMC dot n so that's AMC us Chipotle right coin base dot OQ DT I don't know what DT is I don't know
4816.00s:  what stock f is is that forward yeah forward five in I don't know that one and then you see gm e
4822.80s:  here again and then you see grab and so a lot of these swaps will have like again you'll see
4829.04s:  like massive chunks of them that are just the same you know it's like the same basket of five or
4835.92s:  eight socks that they're shorting or that they're long or whatever and here's another one same same
4841.52s:  thing just slightly different order yeah you just see like the same thing over and over again
4847.04s:  oh here's one with a gm e and robin hood and I don't know what grab is if you guys know what that
4852.48s:  is or five in but yeah whoever this is they're shorting obviously a basket of of entire stocks
4860.08s:  and then some of them will have a long leg of the like it's a portfolio swap that's structured
4864.88s:  in a way where they will actually have a long and a short end of the swap and then you'll see
4868.72s:  their lungs and again what I've seen historically that the lungs are like Nvidia Tesla Apple Microsoft
4875.28s:  it's like the big the big name blue chip tech stocks and from this just said curiosity how do we
4880.88s:  know that there's a long and short or are we just coming up with a reasonable assumption based
4887.84s:  off of what we can see here it's just a basket yeah it's that's what I thought I just wanted to make
4893.36s:  sure as I'm going through this it's because yeah underlier leg one is is usually the you know
4900.08s:  the collateral that they're requesting right it's like that's the the first leg of a swap is what
4903.92s:  they want to receive shares of of this and so the assumption is the entity who is originating
4909.28s:  the swap who's asking for the swap to be created is short these companies and they're asking for
4914.08s:  a stream of you know it basically like synthetic exposure to these shares and so because this is
4918.40s:  the first leg yeah that's the problem I just I was clarifying the difference between like knowing
4925.28s:  like we know and can prove versus we're making a reasonable assumption which it sounds like we're
4930.96s:  just making an assumption which is a reasonable assumption yeah yeah cool yeah all right awesome let me
4937.44s:  yeah I would love to grab a copy of that though that would be absolutely sick I can send it over
4941.20s:  sure yeah cool and then I want to go on in the comments just say hey Zeus said is this like cdOs
4950.48s:  yeah it's exactly like that at the end of the big short where nobody can figure out what the
4956.08s:  hell is going on is a hundred times bigger than you think yes and Aaron said earlier with the
4962.80s:  data and everything you'll never see all of it you'll never you can't tell at the end what was
4970.08s:  closed or rolled for a few months as far as like insandata because you doesn't take that long
4976.64s:  and you can read for tens of billions of trades wrongly or not at all that just came out between
4984.80s:  2013 and 21 for Citadel so I just don't know the data you just pay a few pennies yeah 10 years 10
4992.80s:  years later yep so yeah that's what data is like the ones that have to report it's kind of like
5000.00s:  hedge funds or individual institute or individual investors that are shorting something when you see
5006.80s:  short flow as far as what's reported just remember that every single top brokerage gets fine for
5013.44s:  misreporting every single year what they don't do is on right and they're doing that for a reason on
5019.92s:  certain exact equities yeah and and there's a red at a bit's work but at a bit did like a really
5031.76s:  good deep dive on like you know it was like Goldman Sachs Bank of America like you know Jeffries like
5039.44s:  all these investment and commercial banks that have been miss marking you know long sales or
5045.92s:  short sales as long they've been misallocating customer securities to cover their own positions
5052.24s:  they've been misreporting short positions I mean it's it's literally like once you start reading
5057.20s:  it and it's like you go through page and page and page and page and page of lawsuit from the SEC
5061.68s:  and then they only get a few million dollar fine or 20 million dollar fine and no one ever goes to jail
5066.48s:  you realize that this is it's endemic to the industry I mean this is what they do professionally
5071.76s:  basically yeah I go ahead yeah I was just gonna say I was running through the comments here I was
5079.28s:  gonna grab a couple of those if you guys are ready for a few of those sure sweet um one of them is
5086.48s:  one that I've actually spent a while taking looking taking a look at from Foszy T and it says do you
5090.96s:  think kitty has methods to perfectly time his trades that we haven't completely figured out or is
5095.36s:  buying leaps and waiting and all the installs start you guys can pile on whenever you want but
5101.20s:  I look through I call it fingerprint send you can come up with a way that different
5106.00s:  institutions entities tend to do business and like I said we went through literally every
5110.64s:  single one of his trades and it's possible it is possible I can't prove one way or the other
5118.88s:  but what I can say is there's nothing based on what we've seen from what he's posted that would
5125.76s:  indicate that being the case because if somebody has the ability to perfectly time stuff based on
5132.08s:  what he's posted his portfolio has gone through 60% drawdowns 80% drawdowns then doubling in a half
5139.44s:  two days later like that's not a a function of perfect timing he's held through periods where
5145.52s:  if he captured profit he would realize more money than during the subsequent drop can buy in with
5151.36s:  even more that being said the natural question is where does a quarter billion dollars come from
5156.56s:  and that's why I think it's reasonable to say it's possible so the my thought on that question
5163.52s:  specifically is that we can't tell specifically because nobody has a look inside his book I've not
5170.08s:  seen all of his trades so I couldn't tell you but based on what I have seen from what he has posted
5175.84s:  it does not seem to be the case to me but I don't know if you guys have an opinion on that one
5181.68s:  I don't think Rory and Kitty has to worry about any cycles or anything anymore with his
5187.68s:  power of posting as far as I like that power of posting like he's got the golden ticket with
5197.76s:  no market manipulation posting a picture of a time magazine like everyone's like was commenting on
5205.76s:  my post about you know buying the 30 dollar calls 10 seconds or 10 minutes before the market
5211.20s:  closed on a Friday like oh yeah I'm sure he wants to get a jail and I'd be like try and improve
5217.28s:  market manipulation on that like it took five years to prove it on Elon and make him pay a fine
5224.16s:  that he actually posted we have a buyout for this price that is a hundred percent market
5229.92s:  manipulation on a Twigilay excellence gonna buy out a Tesla for four 20 to share posting
5236.56s:  a picture of a cat and a stock goes up but if he didn't place any trades or if he bought them a
5242.96s:  couple days before whatever yeah there's nothing to that so his in my opinion his strategies changed
5252.88s:  into one that's less frequent perfectly timed and is going off of just his holdings he'll post
5265.84s:  his yellow when he's ready and then it will probably be after a month or more after he's placed
5276.00s:  these trades with a random tweet but he doesn't want to be on the hook for you know buying everything
5282.32s:  before a yellow post that'd be different than a random meme because he's shown his positions
5288.08s:  so you know going through his post for the last couple of years he was onto the cycles onto
5296.32s:  the short interest and everything early but in my opinion now it's just going off of his power
5304.40s:  his roaring power and the other thing too right is like even if he is saying hey I really like
5312.00s:  game stop you know I think it's an attractive investment or something like that that's not
5316.56s:  illegal right I mean Jim Kramer goes on TV every school day and says apples a buy and he has
5324.56s:  like a giant butt buzzes buy and he smashes and he says go buy apple if you're you know if you're
5330.96s:  smart if you know it's good for you or sell micro strategies or Bitcoin sell it sell it sell it
5336.80s:  and there's never any investigation onto you know what his actual portfolio moves are he found
5343.36s:  a loophole with his charitable fund exactly that's the day I started my charity was that I might
5350.00s:  actually be able to give I mean I had this goal forever of getting personal finance into schools
5355.76s:  is ridiculous we learned how to line dance and play the recorder instead of learning about money
5360.88s:  it's all part of the plan yeah but I started like I hit the button to go file for a charity because
5368.56s:  once the fund grew big enough I could post positions that the charity could go into or not
5375.44s:  and it's not going to be from myself or financial advice or from my firm has a fiduciary but it's
5383.36s:  going to be for charity what we think is best for that fund and what positions we go into or get
5390.64s:  out of I was just going to mere Kramer but do the right thing instead of read off the teleprompter
5401.36s:  started to see too like the the edem flow of that like what it actually materializes into why not
5406.72s:  that's fun like over yeah it's sick I have one more question from the chat that I think will be fun
5412.72s:  for us to end on it's very thematic this one's from yesterday and gaming it could be today in gaming
5419.36s:  but it's specifically yesterday in gaming by the way what exactly would it take for the shorts to
5427.12s:  finally be forced to close what's the checkmate how is closure achieved emotional and financial
5435.60s:  now one quick caveat obviously something like emotional closure is one entirely that's up to the
5443.20s:  person and I never be exactly you probably never know what we just got out but from a structural
5449.84s:  question on what eventually short causes the shorts to close I think that's a great question so
5454.96s:  what do you guys think so yeah do I mean did it go ahead so I've been you know I've been bangin the
5463.12s:  drum on twitter for this for a while but look I think there are two things or I'd maybe say
5470.48s:  three-manager catalyst for closure right one is the actual bankruptcy of these funds and the force
5476.88s:  you know float like basically a force wind down of of these entities that have been short
5481.36s:  game stop and the liquidation of their assets and the closing of their liabilities which would be
5485.44s:  closing the short positions the other would be regulatory crackdown across the sector which
5492.72s:  would require right the SEC to be completely reformed from to ruthlessly go after all shorts for
5498.32s:  them to scrape through this continuous net settlement system of the DTC's internal data logs
5502.80s:  and find out who is short and basically go with you know policemen and FBI agents and go to those
5509.12s:  firms and say I gunpoint you know you are closing today or you're you're you're being arrested and
5514.88s:  you're going to jail for life like that's the non-negotiable and then the third is price action
5522.80s:  so as we've seen like whenever the price has moved too too too high and too fast we've seen
5531.84s:  pressure on the shorts to begin closing again like there was some short closing in janker
5536.72s:  2021 there was some short closing in in March but it was minuscule compared to the overall
5541.44s:  value it was like less than 10 percent but there was some and so we know that when these when these
5547.20s:  price mechanisms get distorted when the price starts to just rip and rip and rip there is
5553.92s:  you know there are obviously like risk management out goes in the market that start forcibly
5559.68s:  closing closing including that's something that for start forcibly closing positions against the
5563.84s:  will of the hedge fund that is short that's why Melvin capital blew up so people will say that we
5567.84s:  have no impact on the market that's completely wrong we do absolutely the question is how do we
5572.80s:  get that price action how do we get the price to move it upwards in a very you know aggressive
5577.68s:  and rapid fashion and I think one of the ways that that games up could do this is by acquiring Bitcoin
5584.08s:  and essentially following the micro strategies you know strategy per se right by adopting yeah
5593.20s:  intelligent level but they could do it a better way because micro strategy is like the Dgen you
5597.76s:  know crypto gamblers just just issuing billions of dollars a debt and smash buying Bitcoin yeah
5603.92s:  dude as soon as Bitcoin goes down a little bit micro strategy is gonna they're gonna have fun
5609.84s:  oh yeah and they already have like my mscr's done like 330 like there are I don't people
5614.56s:  bought the top in the options at 440 and I bought some options I sold them in the 400 range most
5620.16s:  of them I have one one call that I'm holding on to the rest of my January calls I was like dude
5625.36s:  there's too much risk on the table here I cannot hold on to this yeah but but overall like the strategy
5632.32s:  has worked micro strategies has had like a 2000 percent increase since august of 2020 so it has
5637.92s:  worked and so if games up could do that but in a much more you know maybe measured and less crypto
5643.04s:  the station way sustainable yeah if they would just buy a 500 million of of Bitcoin and say hey
5649.20s:  some of this you know 20% of this excess cash would put towards Bitcoin and any excess profits we
5654.64s:  have half of them will go into Bitcoin the rest will go into cash balance that would be a completely
5658.96s:  reasonable and affordable with for them to DC into Bitcoin and gain Bitcoin exposure and potentially
5664.80s:  add a huge upside catalyst to their price so that's what I've been been talking about next
5669.04s:  I have a group of people that I'm working with and we're working on drafting the proposals to the
5673.36s:  board to formally ask them to to consider the strategy as long as the word yellow is in there I don't
5679.84s:  see how they get denied just yeah just absolutely um I got a bounce in like 10 minutes but I know Kevin
5686.96s:  there is a couple of things you wanted to hit before we wrap up so I'd love to do that but I'd
5691.12s:  also love to comment quickly on the fact that seems like a lot of people have some sort of issue that
5695.60s:  you have a green screen meanwhile I'm sitting with a fucking t-shirt and a halo above my head so
5702.64s:  I think you look great I think the screen looks good so yeah you're welcome I built this office
5709.36s:  today yeah that's good with your own hands that's the secret yeah as long as you build it they will come
5715.20s:  to say I had this dart board that just showed it up to in my office because I realized other
5720.80s:  darts and for some reason when the suns are blasting my eyes I switched positions and now my
5726.80s:  dart board comes through completely clear before I get my question either of you guys see the data
5735.44s:  on the four nine the five ninety four put on spy yesterday went from a penny to eleven dollars
5744.80s:  in twenty three cents a hundred thousand percent gain yesterday I don't know what it is
5753.52s:  there's no way I'm bent on it because I've tracked every single fed median for like four years
5757.68s:  and usually it's a theta gang day like if the market's up and the fed median happens it closes flat
5763.52s:  if it's down the fed median happens it closes flat to just because it's higher IV for the fed day
5769.76s:  uh with rising and lowering interest rates and then yesterday just imploded for absolutely no
5775.12s:  reason I mean I was stoked it happened but they haven't missed a prediction in like 40 years on
5785.20s:  fed rate cuts or raises and so it was all priced in and then the market has its worst day in years
5794.08s:  I'm like okay well this is probably something but my question for you guys going way back in this
5803.76s:  call to the community of GameStop what is your best theory on why GameStop discontinued
5818.48s:  it's logo clothing besides my theory of rebranding what's your best theory on why they wouldn't
5829.60s:  sell these anymore and they went extinct first because I don't have an educated opinion on it so
5837.12s:  I'm going to shut my fucking mouth and give it to PV on on what specifically sorry all the clothing
5843.92s:  has been gone for 10 months there's a million shareholders out there that loved buying it and
5851.20s:  wearing it some a bunch of shields in the comments on my posts we're saying low margins and stuff
5858.72s:  but when you buy a million t-shirts from China and pretty sure margins are like 75% profit
5864.96s:  I'm so on the corner why did they stop them completely I don't know um I mean would they
5873.76s:  the questions were they selling like shorts like workout shorts no yeah you wanted it
5881.36s:  t-shirts sweatshirts socks shorts wet pants they had a bunch of merchandise here that people
5890.16s:  were buying hand or a fist they almost always said sold out and you had to go find them in like
5894.80s:  a physical store why would you stop making them okay I don't know I mean maybe they're excuses
5903.28s:  like overhead or like uh having too many employees manage it but I feel like that would be a
5908.80s:  really easy thing to manage and I'll even Carol manages his own like clothing store like buy
5915.44s:  himself and it's not that and they've distribution centers too so they really don't really have to do
5920.96s:  it well yeah and they're sold out online every time like the white sweatshirts or something came back
5926.96s:  they're gone within like hours because everyone is posting online buying them that fast
5932.08s:  was going to say to to your point Kevin to further the question and speculation
5936.96s:  typically people that move the merch have really strong communities that want the merch and I
5941.28s:  can't think of yeah companies with a much pre-advertising right so yeah that's a great question Kevin
5948.64s:  PB what's what's the answer I don't know I don't know I get well I would love us can't we can't
5955.44s:  both know yeah just make something up at this point that's why I said rebranding is my theory on it
5962.96s:  why what else get rid of it when everyone's buying it instantly as soon as you get new in stock online
5969.52s:  I don't know about Swarons because I can't find that but the I don't know the the question I would
5974.64s:  offer with that is like if so why not can because how long has it been out off the shelves you
5981.44s:  said for some time now March it's a lot of misrevenue for a rebrand like typically if someone's
5988.88s:  going to do a rebrand you produce up until you go through the rebrand you say this is the last
5992.48s:  that you're going to get these and like it was pretty close you don't what's that unless the rebrand
5998.24s:  wasn't ready yet right but and I'm not a tin foil person but yeah the point the point I'm thinking
6005.12s:  of is that you don't have to stop selling old brands before rebrand I think you can rebrand
6011.04s:  still sell old brands and then so your your thought is they were preparing for rebrand stop selling
6019.28s:  rebrand wasn't ready and then just didn't start selling again just kind of let it go dormant
6025.04s:  yeah there could have been this this massive announcement coming for what it's going to be in
6033.36s:  you know personally if I own if I was running going or I own game stop I wouldn't rebrand because
6041.68s:  in 2021 more people on earth knew what game stuff was than Apple probably because of the news articles
6049.28s:  but if they were going in that direction then there could have been deals that fell through
6057.68s:  timing I know I've seen a lot of data and write-ups on Ryan Cohen's insider trading lawsuit that was
6068.00s:  going through a bad bath and beyond and the Wells Fargo fine of not reporting correctly because
6074.08s:  there's 8,000 loopholes you have to go through to report something perfectly for an SEC report and
6080.08s:  he didn't know how to do it when he sold Chauy and bought Apple and Wells Fargo and they found out
6085.36s:  five years later he typed something up wrong for that million dollar fines there could have been
6090.88s:  things that delayed it and then we just saw the partnership a month ago with PSA and Nat Turner
6099.20s:  coming on you know it could have been there's obviously think a merger in acquisition is usually
6105.52s:  extremely secret and takes a lot of time before that article comes out for the filing and so
6113.28s:  they're easily could have been things where they could have pulled out maybe something they wanted to buy
6117.52s:  was downed out to be fraudulent or you know there's a million things that could happen but I cannot
6124.80s:  I have I mean I stay up at night trying to figure out why to stop telling it be stides they were
6133.68s:  planning on it very soon because it stopped in like March and so maybe May it was going to come out
6141.20s:  and when the stock went up 800% they're like hmm this is going to be a ton of lawsuits and crap coming
6150.32s:  out because the stock just went up 800% and roaring kiddies back and everything so they're like okay it
6156.64s:  was delay this another 30 days run up happens in June as well let's delay it and then into July
6165.68s:  and August was the Wells Bargo stuff on Ryan Cohen my prediction was that they were going to announce in
6174.24s:  May something but they're not going to do that for the stock manipulation they were going to
6181.84s:  correct you know SEC, Fandra everyone the work sir is also sorry a lot of people that it work
6190.32s:  and run both of those entities have worked in the very highest up of finance so if you could find
6199.04s:  GameStop as much as possible to probably get the calls to do so and Ryan probably sees that so
6206.32s:  that's my theory on why to stop selling all GameStop branded clothing
6213.20s:  it's definitely better than mine I if I was a business and they were selling well I would still run it
6220.24s:  all the way up until whatever the new stunts and just stop production but I'm the guy that's going to
6226.24s:  collectible item yeah I got to run I have dinner with my mom and if I'm late I'll probably get a
6236.72s:  wooden spoon chuck my way but absolutely awesome absolutely awesome hanging out with you guys
6242.88s:  for those that are in the chat thank you guys for hanging out and then for PB you have your
6249.12s:  YouTube channel and then you're also on X do you want to let people know where they can find it?
6253.52s:  Sure I'm on YouTube at Peruvian underscore bowl and same thing on Twitter there's only one
6261.28s:  Twitter accounts if you see like Peruvian BOL or whatever that's not me and I'm the only one with
6266.72s:  the verified check mark also on Noster you can find the Noster and pub in my bio so if you want to do
6274.24s:  a decentralized Bitcoin based social media mom there as well thanks and then Kevin for you
6282.40s:  on X Malone underscore well same as Peruvian we get probably 10 fake accounts
6290.96s:  a month coming up they're trying and impersonating I appreciate everyone letting him and I know when
