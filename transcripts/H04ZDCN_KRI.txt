 like we are live. What is up everybody? Hopefully we got apes, outliers, glorious mix there of. You guys will have to forgive the screen and set up a my end. I am on the mobile setup right now. I'm hanging out in New York and we got our boys PB with his ever-evolving backdrop that is becoming more and more chic and then we got Kevin and I am absolutely stoked to get a chance to me with you. I've been watching your material, like your tweets and stuff and I just really like the content that you're putting out and stuff you're talking about. So stoked to get a chance to chat with you. Yeah, appreciate it man. Thanks for having me on. Beautiful. So the overall background I've ran into GameStop just to the table set super fast is I've been a trader for this is my 17th year of trading. I started back when I was in high school. Super super lucky. The guys saw some staying in right now is actually the dude that introduced me to investing and he sent me down a completely different life path and I've traded GameStop before but from an options trading perspective which is super volatile. Lots of movement for me to be able to trade and then this most recent move that we had in the spring, May, June, like that time frame. I started seeing unusual options activity kicking up again. Volume starting to kick up and so it started trading it. Now at this point though, I had a YouTube channel which is completely different. I'm looking at it with the different lens. There's people that are explaining a lot of what's going on and then this is now the 20 26th episode of me doing like specific videos about this. So it's that's at least 30 hours in live streams alone just exploring GameStop beyond all the research I've been doing. So I am infatuated by the whole saga. I would love to hear Kevin from your perspective a little bit about how you found your way into GameStop because you also come from a bit of a more professional background as you can tell because I'm a dude in a t-shirt and you're looking fine a f in your suit. So I would love to learn how you got into GameStop and like what your general lens is there. I got into GameStop right after COVID hit and I was just researching all and screening all the companies that I've just gotten obliterated by the news and the pandemic seeing what opportunities were out there. Things that aren't going to go bankrupt. Things that will survive in this pandemic. And when I was screening them I noticed that GameStop had 99.99% short float reported. And so I was like what? Who would do that? So I called the info company and or the company that I got my data from and asked them is this the real short interest or is this the highest your numbers can go on the data screen and they said that's the highest or numbers can go and I was just like oh my god this only takes one news article to explode. So I started getting all my clients into a small position at you know split adjusted a dollar a share and you know just waiting it out over the summer kind of bounced flat and then Ryan Cohen comes in as the largest holder and buys a significant portion of the company and I was like that's the news that's going to send this. And from that day on the cycle started I'm then not being able to find shares started going up. I can't say that part because it's going to be in our documentary but then January 21 happens. I left Edward Jones I was at Edward Jones at that time my clients were top 10 shareholder of GameStop in 2020 before the sneeze and then after January left Jones and opened up my own firm and the rest is kind of history from there that's how I found it. I was talking with Keith Gill and other people in 2020 going over the strategy the deep value everything like that and it's crazy because I didn't know Keith was also a financial professional and then once everything came out and him getting called into Congress are pretty much just white internet clean. I was like I don't know the sound fun to me. Yeah fascinating and then just one quick follow up for you specifically from a professional investing slash trading background you obviously were working with clients and one of the things you were working with your clients is this GameStop position prospectively and was that something at the time that was like a hard sell or was it something that you already did in different kinds of forms with other positions and this was just another one of those types. Another one of those types I had an I have an eye for a anomalies and noticing like things are off or things are on like chart patterns and so my clients before it had these crazy positions or short squeezes that had ended up being 5x to 15x money just based on me researching so much. My father who was also a financial advisor in my entire life I'm a second-gen he called me and after I sent him one of my white papers he's like God you you should have been an analyst but they don't make any money. I was like yeah I just weirdly have a passion for research like the three of us all do and I just nailed in on my niche once we could once commissions were kind of gone and manage money started where you know percentage of the portfolio value I realized I could use all my research to grow my clients money which would literally benefit me and more money they make more money I make and love the strategy took all the pressure off of them because Jones was still the highest commission probably in the United States that 2% buys or sells for stock so you know 100,000 or buy of Apple they had to pay 2 grand in commission for it so once I was calling clients to you know what sell this to buy this they know that that called made me zero dollars cost them zero dollars and I only think it's the best thing for them because I get nothing out of it except for their portfolio performance. I figured the the next thing I wanted to talk about because PB I've had a chance to pick your brain a bit about how you got involved in game stuff and like the history so I thought we could just change gears for a minute and do a bit of a current state assessment. I'd love to hear really from both of you but we could start with PB to get a sense of just where we are with game stop today and what your general thoughts are about price action how things are positioned don't have to go into whether or not you think that there's a squeeze coming or anything like that like just overall level setting and then just one other admin note for the question I very much view myself as like a guest in the ape house because I know that there's people have been in this thing for four years now and that's not my path right I'm a traitor I'm in an out of things so I really like to be able to understand the perspective of people and PB and I have had a chance to talk to a few times so I've also been able to see the arc of his perspective which hopefully have a chance to understand yours as well and the evolution of the Kevin but PB current state of game stop where we have sure so I think this year especially as we're closing out 2024 it's been a very transformative year for game stop you know we've had basically two prior years of almost like a slow steady grind in both stock price and also company performance Ryan Cohen was essentially committed to making game stop cashful positive and to stop seeing bleeding losses every single year you know he wanted this this overall business transformation to take place but it's taken longer than he's wanted to and so he's had to let go of you know executives he's appointed he's made some blunders right they did the crypto marketplace which kind of fell apart and didn't provide enough revenue and so he was trying to write like he was trying to justify his investment is trying to say like look this company was bleeding but we can turn it around we can fix these these problems and you know finally this year they've been able to make it cashful positive and you know reduce SG&A enough to actually make the margins worth it and a lot a large part of that means closing stores I think something like 20% of the stores they've closed and so their overall square footage has reduced and then so has their net sales but the benefit with that is you know becoming profitable is obviously more valuable than just being a bigger company that's unprofitable and that's bleeding every single quarter and so this year sorry I just had a question on that for the store closures is that mostly been in Europe it in my remember in that crackler is that also like 50 50 split I thought it was mostly Europe I just don't remember I think it is mostly Europe but there are some there are some closures in the us as far as I know and I haven't looked at the breakdown I just know it's around 22% of total square footage has been lost since like 2021 I think thank you so and maybe Kevin you can fact check me on that number if you know it's different but this year right like we saw DFB return in a big way and we saw the gamma squeeze and you know the short squeeze thesis kind of play out again and game shop was able to take advantage of this price action you know pretty pretty adeptly and and raise a huge amount of capital from share offerings so they did first the the initial share offering in in May in ATM which was around I think like you know between 40 and $30 per share and then they did which raised you know like one or two one and a half billion I think and then they did another share offering in June when DFB started tweeting again and and the game around built even stronger we saw the price skyrocket to like $80 share and games up did another ATM they started you know selling at you know huge amounts of of of shares and and raising you know up to what they have now is 4.5 and change billion dollars of cash and so you know we've known for a while that Ryan Cohen not only wanted to just save this company from dying he actually wanted to transform it into you know you could call it like a chewy like business right and online e-commerce company that could compete with like a sub amazon and now with this cash on hand they actually finally have the ability to to make this reality and a large part of this speculation online has been right like they're going to use this cash as a tool to acquire other companies and then those companies hopefully have synergy with game stops legacy business and then that can help propel them you know in the coming years and quarters to further success but the problem that we've obviously run into is we haven't seen what that is yet we don't know and so it's the same thing I said back in October I think right like we're still kind of waiting on our hands and they haven't given any indication as to what exactly they are going to do with the money now if you read like the financial statements the 10 q's and then the earning reports the one thing they've said consistently since they raised this cash is they've said they will use it for general corporate purposes and and and and or including merges and acquisitions and they include that exact phrase in every single statement they've put out so they're kind of hinting that they're looking at this but again until they actually make the move we don't know and they probably want to keep that right on the down low as long as possible yeah and that makes it ton of sense too because I mean companies like that when they raise cash typically it's for a reason of some sort to your point really opportunistic raise but yeah sitting on a pile of cash as a company it's only so good until you find a way to you know generate revenue from it so interesting update thank you and then um Kevin I'd love to to hear your current perspective of just where the company is and from from you Kevin I if you don't mind I would also love to understand from like your involvement in 2020 and your perspective at that time how is it shifted to where we are today just because I like I don't know I enjoy understanding more the details on like the arc of analysis sure um I'll start off really quick by answering uh approbions as of February GameStop still had 41 69 stores open um they closed over 1100 so with the news on Europe's closures were probably sitting close to 1500 closed and 36 and so third are going to be closing um we don't know that number until next earnings comes out for the quarter uh as far as GameStop right now and last piggyback on approbions in the wording of the report with their cash by how they can also buy marketable securities which is at the full discretion of Ryan Cohen so they can now pretty much be a holding company of individual stock I've not found out anyone that can prove my loophole wrong about them swing trading their own stock under that wording of marketable securities so usually when a company buys back stock they retire those shares and it you know goes lower and lower and lower but there's nothing saying they can't buy shares of their own company not retire them and then sell them for profit so that was by far the most exciting thing that I noticed in the wording that I could not figure out the answers to as far as GameStop now compared to 2020 at that time short squeeze play anything that's shorted 99.99 or more I just saw it as you know this thing just needs one catalyst and I would not buy brick and mortar for my clients at that time I'm like you know for years they're asking hey let's buy a sear it's down 90% or these companies and I'm like you really want to compete with Amazon like are you gonna order more stuff from Sears or buy more stuff in Sears or order stuff on Amazon this month but the short squeeze play in the last four years turned into a complete turnaround of a profitable company nobody on Wall Street no analyst thought it could ever be done and now with even more unprofitable source closed the profitability is just gonna grow can't guarantee that but if they do everything exactly the same then profitability would grow on the next earnings report and they have this cash pile now that number one I agree with through and they don't want to say what they're gonna use it for give any hints and if they don't have any backdoor ideas right now then Ryan Cohen and GameStop is sitting on a higher cash percentage than Berkshire Hathaway right now with markets at all time highs so wait for dip crash whatever it is to buy cheaper really good companies for mergers and acquisitions or with the marketable securities you know buy Apple the next time it's right it drops 33% or Tesla next time it drops 70% or Nvidia the next time it drops 70% and so he's got this word chest not only profitability but cash that is back ended up going into a possible market downturn to deploy at that time you can see whoever feels like answering one of the the conversations that's been floating around a lot is the idea of a holding company and different ways that that could look so from your perspectives trying to perceive what RC might be trying to configure obviously it's a guess nobody fully knows but looking at it from looking at the game from his perspective what do you guys think he might be trying to structure if he goes the route of a holding company what might that actually look well Kevin I'm sure you could I'm not sure how much you can you can talk about this but you know there's a lot of there's a lot of conspiracy theories about what's going on and there's some evidence there's some like tangential evidence that seems to support some of the theories right there's just there's also not enough to fully confirm anything so we can't say for sure but one of the main ones is that he wants to create almost like a kiritzu style you know business co-op that basically entails a central counterparty like a bank and I think he's already you can correct me if I'm wrong Kevin but I think he's already filed for Teddy corp to be a bank and you know the goal is to make have this entity be like a loaning institution for this group of companies that will work together synergistically to compete against Amazon and this comes from the Japanese you know idea of a business that emerged in the wake of the 1940s after World War 2 as Japan was starting to rebuild these you know kiritzuz were formed which were basically like formal corporations between businesses to work together on pricing on on you know like logistics transportation all those things so that the business could could effectively compete with offshore entities in the US or in Europe and what this basically entailed is by the late 1980s right Japan was a much more developed economy than before they'd experienced the most rapid economic growth of any country in the 1980s and they also saw you know unfortunately the development of a bubble but these business practices were fundamentally sound generally and they were adopted worldwide and so the theory is with his you know with his creation of this Teddy bank entity and his loaning of capital to bedbath and beyond and other you know small little tidbits of information that we've been seeing that he's trying to form a kiritzu you know the other example is I don't remember the name of that company but there's an international shipping conglomerate the CEO what does it call it I'm blanking on it Kevin it's uh yeah anyways what Zim Zim Zim is that the name of it okay but I think yes okay the CEO of that shipping company has also been um in conversation with Ryan Cohen and like why would Ryan Cohen be talking to an international logistics company if not for you know either acquisition or potential partnerships to get credit global competitor to amazon someone just said in the comments flex port yes that's it flex that's it yeah yeah shout out to you oh that's it itchy itchy go shout out to you so I I got to tell you man like the chat in the community is probably one of the coolest things about this whole thing cassettes that's how I found PB is they were like yo this other dude does a lot of this stuff you should talk to him and they've been on point so shout out for the for the heads up there um I don't know how much you can go in a by response or answer your thoughts on that Kevin but I would love to hear your perspective as far as the holding company goes uh and the bank proven I can't remember I can't remember if it was tin foil or if it was real on the teddy bank so I'm just gonna leave it at that uh if I want his bank I do know that finally that's a bank is almost impossible uh we saw so far and other companies try and do it for a very long time to be an FDIC bank so a company not running yet I'm sure you can research it while I'm talking to see if there's answers on that uh but as far as holding company goes to my understanding and the wording on the earning reports over the last four quarters of marketable securities they can be a holding company they don't have to even switch over to teddy to do a game stock can buy birkshire and apple and google stock today and have it on their balance sheets um which should be a holding company you know can go on rent uh I hate the words back because of you know everything that happened but they have four point six billion dollars to deploy in any way that Ryan sees fit and he's not gonna do it in a ridiculous way you know he is a penny cruncher and I'm guessing besides or because nobody knows anything about him and he had no social media or anything that probably works 120 hours a week like e-line too where his schedules are at five minute intervals and sleeps an hour a night so I feel like he's going into this number one is main goal was profitability and saving the company number two is going to be either building out to maximize margins or buy out which I think you only do on dips from mergers and acquisitions or be a holding company for the backdoor to buy game stock on cycles for other companies that he sees fit or Bitcoin if he sees fit because now it's a marketable security so kind of a wide a wide array of possibilities and I've seen a lot of people throwing out different configurations the the thing I'm really interested in is to understand the way that RC might be perceiving the landscape as it sits today and if one of those routes might look more appealing to him than some of the other routes again all conjecture we don't know but it's I think an interesting exercise to try to look at it from what he might be trying to roadmap out for the company because the way that I saw him originally raising again raising those funds companies when they're raising money like that it's typically for some sort of purpose not just the fact that it's exceedingly advantageous timing which it was imagine as he was doing that he probably had some ideas on you know what route he might want to take it now when you see game stop closing stores it starts to show at least some sort of underlying change in the theme do you you guys think that the store closure is going to continue and it's going to be a really core bubble of just the really profitable brick and mortar stores to open up other business lines or do you guys see the brick and mortar element shifting in some sort of way potentially even expanding? Kevin you want to take that or I can take it? I'll go I see it as unprofitability if it was your own company and you have a hundred employees selling something if 30 of them have consistently lost money all the time I'd close them out until I became profitable as a whole and now you know he's probably thinking or gains on the entire board's probably thinking how many more do we close I mean international's expensive and if not profitable and they're international it's probably a tough decision you know we're bringing out of a country like that's just like the magazine that they dropped with like 20 million subscribers I can guess that it wasn't making money because we know what a point to that so they'm canceling it was just to get as profitable as possible but now with the PSA partnership and I posted about this before now they have a game stop store in almost every single city in the United States as far as like a big city not a small town where people can go get their cards graded and send them in and it's an instant profit for games off on these PSA gradients so now I would believe that it's at a a standpoint of whether to close stores or keep ones open in certain places where they see the PSA momentum growing the store is not profitable but they went from 10 cars the first month to 100 to 1000 within three months getting graded they might keep that one open if they saw no change in it and unprofitable they'll probably be like okay let's close this one I think there'll be a lot more strategic with it same with Ryan going after shipping just like he did with Chui he has a store in almost every big city with same-day shipping if you want to pay for it so your PS5 can get delivered in three hours and so those are hubs across the entire United States in every single town imagine a mini Amazon hub with just a specific source of inventory they can be delivered to your house within a couple hours so and you know the other thing too is like and I think you know Kevin you've you've talked to Ian at length about this right and Ian does a really good job of laying this out that you know if you look at Ryan Cohen's backstory right he was born in Canada he you know he really spends a lot of time with his father and his family and for him like he you know gains a lot of lessons and you know life advice from his dad and unfortunately his dad passes away but one of the things or a couple of the things that his dad instilled in him was the value of hard work and honesty and integrity right and so that's how he approached uh Chui so when he started Chui you know well over a decade ago he wanted to take on Amazon because he felt that Amazon was starting to become predatory in their practices and especially especially with regards to pets and pet food so there were multiple and like the mid to late 2000s there were multiple outbreaks of E. coli or food poisoning with the pet food that Amazon was selling Amazon was not doing quality control from these suppliers in China and India and people's pets were getting a second die and Amazon didn't care because again they're you know by this time in you know 2010 2011 they're starting to run a you know multi-billion dollar business this is just one of the product lines they have a small team of people that in customer support for the pet food section and so they didn't really you know they didn't really care if people's pets were dying it's just a lawsuit you settle for a couple hundred grand and you just move on and Ryan was you know obviously in sense at this and he's been quoted in interviews as well as you know news pieces as saying like this was one of the motivators to to push him to start Chui and so when he does start Chui he makes it completely like it's like they pull their opposite of what Amazon is instead of focusing on bottom line profitability focuses on the customer customer satisfaction he believes that customer satisfaction will drive the bottom line you know not the other way around and so you know I mean this this carries through to him sending literally like they send out letters or notes to people when their pets pass away they can even send send out recurring birthday notes to people when they're if they've noticed that they're they've been buying from Tweet consistently and they have a birthday for their pet in on the website they'll send out a birthday notice and I know people who've gotten that which again adds that personal touch and so you know in 2015 after Ryan Cohen had had sold Chui and moved out you know of control of the company he was looking for a new investment he was just sitting on billions of dollars a cow but I was just waiting to see what was next and what he saw was GameStop being shorted you know we could save and you know criminally right like just excessively shorted and he saw that the board was just completely incompetent with the way that they were running the company they were overloaded and that there was a $400 million bond to come and do in March of 2021 and they had no plan to pay it and they had like less than 50 million than liquid cash and so he said look all this takes is for someone to come in refocus the business on what it used to do best and you know we can turn on this franchise around and he's been you know even despite the fact that a lot of people on Twitter get angry at at how slow the progress has been he has been successful in you know making this thing profitable on a net basis and reducing overall expenses and so and it's not easy because running a company like GameStop a legacy brick and mortar business in a e-commerce world is is difficult so you got to give him kudos for that and I think that you know if he if he is if he is genuinely getting interested in a co-op or curative some form it's going to be on the same with the same philosophy of customers first right he had a tweet that went viral that was you know protect women and children and I think at all or pets and children at all costs right and that's kind of his philosophy and so he views Amazon as this predatory firm that's just destroyed the American you know retail segment and effectively gutted the American consumer because now they have fewer options it's just buy from Amazon or don't or or nowhere because there's no other options and you know I think that that that relates to his overall strategy so I I think we're still in this limbo of waiting to see what he does with the cash because it's a huge amount of cash and he could do multiple things right he could literally buy multiple businesses and entire companies with this amount of cash so we're still waiting and and but I think that we're I think that things are happening in the background that there's not able to allow us to be privy to yeah now one of the big elements I've curious from specifically evaluation perspective from really both you guys again is turning around brick and mortar store keeping it at least on and profitable long enough to continue down the path is difficult doable with difficult and one of the the big tailwinds that I've kind of seen is just how supportive the game stock community is of game stock it's like next level there's not a lot of people that feel the way about Amazon right like there's there's nobody from an investor standpoint and from a communal standpoint that's so stoked about Amazon so what role do you think the community plays in the future direction of game stock because it has been a massive thing that's kept things afloat to a degree to where we are now so do you think that's part of the consideration that might go into future business plans so taking it from the perspective of if you were RC how do you integrate the game stock community into future plans do you at all or do you kind of just focus on the business and hope that the community falls along I can I can I can talk about do you want to chat yeah I don't want to take all the airtime but you know in corporate finance there's something and and you know Kevin you might know about this but there's something called the dividend clientele which is you know the study that whenever a company starts to issue dividends on a consistent basis and if they're able to continually support that dividend a strong base of retail investors as well institutional but but investors become toddlers for lack of a better term of their stock and so if the company continues to promote dividends and to give dividends to the shareholders these shareholders will come in and they'll buy through bull and bear markets through cycles through economic catastrophe through what have you because they believe that they can get continual benefits from from holding the stock right in the form of these dividends and that creates these very strong hands that are much more hard to shake out of the market than than we can's right there's tons of studies showing that for example companies with a with a dividend clientele have much less much lower ratios of short interest and they also are much less much less often the targets of short attacks because again it's just harder to shake when we have all these people that are holding on to the company and holding on to these dividends harder for them to to be shaken off of holding the stock and the same thing I'd say is true of of of games obviously like there's a very very huge retail contingent of investors who have bought shares and they're essentially never never selling which is why you kind of see these price cycles move them way they do you see spikes in price from a gamma or even like a mini short squeeze then we see a retracement and it comes back down to to a hard level where it just will not go below you know whether that's $20 post split now in 2024 whether that was you know $4 free split in 2020 like there are these levels where it's like there's just this hard wall of buyers that cannot be exhausted and so that's why big that's why I'm sorry GME is for example so hard to chart is because like it just doesn't act like a normal stock but those you know that retail investor segment buy a lot of measures and again it's hard to actually get the exact number but by a lot of measures is probably the largest as a percent of the companies float of any company in history so it is you according to your status yeah yeah it's there's yeah absolutely so I was just saying that because I was like maybe there's some company out there that I don't know about that's fucking you know sorry sorry it is the highest above a billion dollar market cap because there was a couple that tried to do it on extremely micro's to try and prove crime but as far as a billion dollar company or profitable company they are the highest percentage of float that are direct registered in individual investor names yeah and that's around what 25 percent or so yeah and the one exception right is like global links with Robert Simpson 2005 where he bought like 100 limp percent the flow and dres did but that was yeah that was a sub like 30 million market cap company but yeah for the majority of you know of companies they've never seen an effect like this and so the retail segments all probably over you know 800,000 holders across multiple nations and they're all supporting it not only by buying the stock and holding it but by actively going out and buying items like game stock like there's giveaways there's tons of people on Twitter I know Hachi does does giveaways of gift cards I think you've done that to Kevin charity events yep yep there's people who give away the playing cards and basically they that means they go and they buy like a thousand dollars worth of it and then give it away on Twitter or fund razor and yeah there's just there's a level of support here that has never been seen before in corporate finance like ever it's there'd be history books written about this for sure what do you have there's things I found speaking of support is I part of what I started doing I got to move the chat out of the way so I can share part of my screen is the community actually introduced me to this document I don't know if you guys can see but it's it's called the diamond handbook and it's a pretty comprehensive list of gme theories and we've been going through literally every single one of them and I think we're close to a little over halfway through like we're in like over page 400 or so one of the common themes that I've come across as I've been prusing through all this documentation looking up the source documents and whatnot is this is become a massive interest of mine because GameStop has become the vector through the ape community that has identified a lot of underlying stuff that looks really interesting from a regulatory standpoint and what I mean by that is you could probably read in between the lines is it looks like there's a lot of fuckery going on everything from DTCC down to fin refines and stuff like that so I wanted to ask you both your perspectives of the roles of these larger financial institutions around something like GameStop specifically people that how they get involved and what their motivations might be for how they get involved Eric you pointed out absolutely perfectly and I said this on almost everyone on this face calls I've ever done the best thing from the January GameStop saga sneeze in my opinion is that there's more than a million people now that looked that looked corruption and data every single day against the people at the top and post it instantly to multiple social media sites but millions that have gotten screwed between OG AMC when it was in the basket and then TLP that bad there's so many people that are just trying to that probably created some of those docs that you have in there highlighted that before January 21 might not have ever invested before or had an index fund or something and so the best thing that came from that is that many people try and expose crime every single day like they they all thought at the top that retail would go away and forget about it and they didn't like all these people are in different communities doing this famous acting every single day as they were 40 months ago and they can't hide like eventually they have to file things and there's people way smarter than me programming and algos for notifications that are getting these finnera and scc fileings loaded instantly to the computer and posting them across the entire world about what's happening and I think that is the absolutely cool thing yeah it's like the biggest like crowd you know almost like a crowdfunded financial research community in history like they're literally has never been anything like that and again I was on you know the Reddit boards in January of 2021 and again I used to work at a private equity fintech firm and there were people that were you know active traders at my company that we're looking at it there were people that were options traders commodity traders I met people through this community who are mathematicians wealth managers right portfolio managers bankers there's old man repo who's a former manager of a repo desk at a big bank like there's all these people that have just come out of the woodwork and done research and started saying like you know what is actually going on because the game stop phenomenon is so like puzzling to the financial establishment because it just bucks every single traditional trend right we saw the beginning of this squeeze play out in January and you know people were in the lead up to to like the zenith right there people were starting to get you know more and more agitated with the amount of propaganda from the media saying that the squeeze was over that you should go home don't buy the stock you don't need to own it and then with the Robin Hood shutting off the buy button as well as 182 retail brokers there was just a mass outrage at at the system and so people that started putting out the meme right like they turn off the buy button we turn off the cell button like I don't care about money anymore I just want to hold this stock and and show the system that this is not okay and so that's become almost like the calling card of the community right we're we're not only you know looking for for wealth and for capital gains we want to see real change in the financial system of the way that things are structured now because it's clearly unsustainable there's so many companies that get naked-chorded so many companies that that suffer from FTDs and you know we've seen through the saga we've seen the proliferation of like education at every level of finance so you know there were people looking into FTD cycles and how the continuous net settlement system works that are people looking into the ETFs like you know we found that I mean just in what June of those year I did a DD on the ETFs and one of the biggest ETFs that holds GMME which is XRT which is the spider retail ETF has been on the SEC threshold list for shorting for like 1400 days and so how can an ETF be on the threshold list for 1400 days and nobody investigates what's going on and so like that these kinds of questions started to get raised and for the first time right there's a massive retail push to to get change across and we pressured Gary Gensler we pressured other SEC officials to change and I think there's like been more education than anything that we could have ever dreamed about that has that has proliferated across you know the globe basically. Literally cannot second that more it's been one of the funnest parts for me it's like I said I've been training for a long time but I have learned so much about market structure micro structure and relationships through GameStop that literally never would have crossed my mind previously because my job is to look at options throw some numbers around and essentially make a guess and so I normally just do that and as I started looking at a lot of the GameStop stuff and what they're pointing out it's like wait a minute like there's there's actually some really interesting things going on here that do not seem to make sense to me or they do not seem to be fully up aboard which leads me to a natural follow on question because you mentioned some of the the short side and actors from that perspective do you guys think that there are still legacy shorts open from the original squeeze that have just been moved into different financial instruments and perpetuated or do you think that those have been satisfied now and it might be a new group of shorts? No absolutely absolutely I think there's still shorts stuck here I mean if you read and again like this might sound for a lot of people like a you know forechand conspiracy theory but you read the House Financial Services Committee own report on GameStop it's like 182 pages I read the whole thing and you know what they say in their own words they say according to our analysis of internal SEC data this was not a short squeeze shorts never shorts were never the majority volume in this in this in this squeeze it was just retail buying and gamma hedging that was it like 2021 was not the end that 120 140 percent some brokers you know Finder at one point was printing 260 percent Ian Carroll sent me one at 313 percent short interest right none of that was fully closed by the by the House Financial Services Committee own report and so if they weren't able to close in 2021 like how are they able to close now without causing causing the the prices spike and so we you know we've we've tracked them using swaps and derivatives and other instruments to just move their obligations forward and just try to kick the can continually and you know archa goes was also an example of that right like GME was name dropped in the archa goes lawsuit when they collapsed and there's also evidence you know tangential evidence from archa goes is excess capital premium charges which are the charges that are are assigned to them by the nscc is like basically their liability for their stock portfolio and you see like their excess capital premium spikes and forms the exact pattern of GME in late January and early february of 2021 and they blew up in March of 2021 and so like the evidence is there that it it wasn't just right uh tin foil comes through to the truth that these shorts and clothes and that they use derivatives and swaps or total return swaps to to try to hedge exposure they were actually doing this um now the question is how many other short short author they're still open we don't know and it's going to be really hard to know because again and i think Kevin can expand more on this right they've changed how they calculate short interests so that they can't go above 100% ever again so the formulas have been changed yeah and i also think you you highlight another thing say i spent a while because again derivatives is kind of like what i do it's like the only thing i know anything about and the the tricky part with something like swaps is there you can get details on them but a lot of more black boxes you understand in the specific terms of them are are difficult now it that leads to a follow-on question though which is with some of the um at the markets and new shares being offered shorts would have been given several opportunities to finally take an exit at not blow-up levels still uncomfortable still they're gonna eat the launch but um not necessarily go through implosion so then why maintain the cost of carrying the shorts is it you think they're approaching it from the this is in eventuality where this thing is gonna roll over and go out of business and if so most of them are going to be using Bayesian models which as a company starts to acquire several billion dollars in free cash the probability of that business going out of business in the near term starts to become less likely so then do you think that might influence their future decision to continue maintaining the shorts or not can't have and do you want to answer that or i can tackle it too yeah i got it let's go that was a serious question there uh well good i have nothing prepared so i'm just going off the dome i'm hoping this stuff isn't terrible no no it was amazing i i'm just trying to remember the points from it so when it comes to shorts and clothes for the input it perfectly they even said it thanks then i do believe there's a massive position in archaic goes bag because everyone that touches it goes bankrupt and someone's holding that and i posted about it yesterday but i haven't found any answers i haven't been on ex yet today but i posted the the reports posted him out on friday for ubs or what they're holding in their bag from credit suisse and then someone in the comments said that they put it so what's really said there's going to be archive for 50 years before it gets released and so i have not deep dive that i'm sure prove it's not going to be able to sleep because of that comment and trying to figure out which one of those two before tomorrow morning that would be epic if it comes out finally but i think the position got too big on the basket to close for the market maker swaps financial instruments or as hedge funds go they could have closed at any time because like you said the at the money offerings but that's the worst time because retail is hitting by almost ungodly high volume when those offerings have come out but market makers proved in may when 500 million shares traded and we know it wasn't like people selling that they can get out at any time as far as small shorts like if they were shorted you know 100 million a hedge fund on a market maker or someone with tens of billions of dollars of security sold not yet purchased but they have a liquidity last four years during the run ups and the cycles and the hype and roaring kitty and all these to get out of it they didn't they were going to cause buying fresh right that retail was already doing that and by the time we see Friday's market close it's back down to max paying and everyone got screwed because it went up 50% drop 40% within a week so they can they could have gotten out as far as a hedge fund goes I want everyone watching to also separate a hedge fund just like a small office or you know even a big office billion a couple billion assets first market makers with trillions of dollars of orders that come through every single day that they are allowed to legally counterfeit shares and go try and find them and if they can't they put them into different derivatives trade between each other all these other things and so I do believe they could have gotten out of it liquidity was there based on market makers except exception to create liquidity for everyone during those cycles on the bid and ask there's no way 50 mil or 500 million shares sold in May from retail investors right synthetic they were going to have to be delivered and then we saw the June run up right after it again. What do you guys think the current positioning is then for start maybe market maker side of things and then hedge fund high frequency whatever you want to buck into that institutional component do you guys think that if you were to divvy up the current shorts that may or may not be out there where do you think they live as a percentage wise between the entities. I mean it's so this is where it's hard to parse it out right because again some of the swap data shows you know wildly different different figures but you know we looked at in 2021 obviously there was the infamous Brazilian puts which were actually found by Lawson was a finance professor very smart guy at a Bloomberg terminal he found this subsidiary of of credit suisse in Brazil that held 80% of the float of GameStop in deep into money calls as well as puts or out of the money puts and so the question is like why does this credit suisse subsidiary have 80% of the float in like call options basically like what what are they doing and when he reached out and asked them what's what was going on a day later the data was erased from the Bloomberg terminal and the support team told him oh that was a data error that you should never see that again don't worry about it and he's like whoa whoa whoa he's like he's never seen that before right that there's a data error going on of this but that was 80% of the float with a single entity and now credit suisse was a prime broker prime broker for like dozens and dozens of hedge funds right that were short GameStop archigos being one of them there's also a smaller hedge fund that was following along archigos as footsteps I don't have their name confirmed yet but Dario who's another banker and finance guy who's right on Twitter he he shared with me in our podcast that we did last June that there was a couple other hedge funds that he knows personally have were were in on the GameStop trade and that we're trying to use swaps to get out of the short obligations and so if if one prime broker which may even be the largest prime broker that was facilitating shorts against GameStop or swaps against GameStop if they were 8% of the float then what were the others I mean had probably around 120 140% at least and the swaps that we saw rolling over this summer that were contributing to the price action were also around I mean some of these were massive they were like in terms of share count some of them were 20% of the float in a single swap rolling over over the course of a week and that was just from the data that we could scrape together from like the CFTC and so if you know it's hard to give you a hard number on like how many shorts are still out there but I would say well over 100% of the float is probably still short and prove it. Of the entities that have shorted though like splitting between market makers and hedge bonds other kinds of shops out institutions do you think most of the short float whatever the total number is most of that is with the market making side of things do you think that it's within the hedge fund side of things or do you think it's 50 50 split the reason why I asked the question is because the impact of the market and the way things would move would vary quite a bit based on which of those conditions it might be so that's the premise. I think it's mostly moved to the derivative side of the hedge fund book personally I mean the market makers right they're much more agile and they also have many more loopholes to work with in terms of kicking the can down the road and so they don't even have to really use swaps in the same way that like a hedge fund or a private family office would have to have to do they can use just the market maker exemption and continually kick the can and so it's much easier like you said it's much easier for you know structurally for a market maker to avoid actually making good on the promises in the form of stock loans for long periods of time and so I think that market makers have largely probably cleared out their excessive obligations and it just rests on the swap side for hedge funds and banks. Who's thinking Kevin your thoughts? Proving do you think the swap rollover at the end of spring the May June swap rollover caused the price action so you've seen every quadwitching and swap rollover for four years right and how many came true with a big bump up zero would you not contribute that to Roinkitty at the time I would obviously for May right and then June would have been my presumption sorry catch you off would be the tip of 35 on other firms and kind of just entire week of ro to air two months of him tweeting stuff compared to that swap finally causing something because how many had it? Yeah yeah that's that's that's accurate but if you look at Richard Newton's some of his work like he's tracked it back to 2020 2021 and you know again it's it's kind of like it's kind of like what you say like some of the swaps rollover and they're they're they're large and then the price barely moves up a few percent or flat and then other times there's a swap rollover and the price goes absolutely ballistic and so my theory is that you know May and June were particularly large swap rollovers as well as actually November and December that we have we didn't swap rollover who would be looking to tweet when they saw the swap extra big yeah Roinkitty and so and this would also kind of answer right if he understands the swap cycles this well and like their their obligation cycles and when they actually have to hedge like you this under this could explain why he came back with what was it like triple or quadruple the amount of cash that he left with in 2021 because he disappeared in 2021 with like you know what was it was it 80,000 shares or 800 that was 800,000 shares I think and it came back with five million something like that post and so it's like he five X more than five X his position and everyone was like wait like Roinkitty has a quarter of a million dollars or billion dollars like he has 200 million like what how did he grow like he's now the size of a of a private family office or hedge fund like a mid size one like he's starting to get out there and so yeah I don't think it's unresumable to to expect that he understood this and you know there there is some evidence right like if you look at the swap cycles there were much more consistent in 2021 than they were in 2022 and 2023. 2024 we had swap rollovers rollovers in March and April that were small to mid size that didn't have any impact on price and then we had we actually did have a big really big one at the end of May and then a really big one in early June and Roinkitty's tweets were exactly timed with the expiration of those swaps and I don't know if you know finance lot on twitter but finance lot was another guy he was like a trend follower and chart analyst and financial analyst and he took I asked me for the FDD and the swap dad and I sent it to him and after looking at it for like a day he said Roinkitty's next tweet is going to be June 3rd and he's like right before he's like he's like if you look at the pattern that's what he's going to do and I thought at the time I was like no I'm like I think he finished tweeting in May the price went back down I still hold onto my I bought some more shares but I'm like just just chilling here and then you know what came to fast June 3rd he starts tweeting again and then the price subtracting again and so I think again I think he probably is playing the cycles and he knows about them and they're probably exacerbating his moves but I absolutely I think that he he's having an impact on price obviously I mean there's probably alga goes out there that are smashed by bitcoin every time he tweets because they're just trying to front run retail liquidity we saw two weeks ago yeah yeah on the airplane definitely a million share purchase within seconds yep of his tweet and that's why he tweeted at him too I was like aren't you just do this like late on a Friday as well it's not market manipulation to tweet a picture of a high five or something or just say hi and then to lee instantly the alga is going to buy a million shares and the options are going to go from a penny to a dollar within seconds with absolutely no market manipulation you didn't buy those shares someone else did on it and then he decided to ignore me and then do the same exactly on Monday morning after that with the 109 and 420 tweet that he had was three days later I was like yeah cycle theory so fascinating to me because I've done a ton of research and trying to regress it to see if I can identify an actual trigger based on the swaps and I think one of the issues with it for it having any efficacy is that we we don't know how they settle and we don't know what the requirement is, comes settlement because they can always just make a new one and they can change the contents of it so the we one of the series that we did actually on the live streams that we typically do on Saturday which is GameStop specific is we we literally went through every single one of roaring kiddies yolo tweets and I made an entire tracker for every single trade he put on what the account value was changes in account value and what the positions that he put on to get a sense of his trading style because I was actually really surprised that when I went all the way to the beginning that he started with all options which was very surprising to me because from the communities I don't know from like the the sense I get from a lot of the community seems like options were like a bad thing like you weren't supposed to talk about them they were telling me and stuff like that which was interesting so have you guys done specific research on not just the swaps that we think might have led to price movement but just swaps impact broadly across all of them and the reason I ask it is just because one of the things I noticed when I look at the GameStop community is people do tend to have a bit of a confirmation data mining where we have something that we want to see is true and we go looking for that and I have a stats background so a big part of what we typically would do is look for the other side right like a broad analysis and I'm so fascinated by the broader research around swaps because of how nebulous they are so to summarize that really long thought into a succinct question I'm wondering if you guys have done like specific research on the swaps as an entire group to see market impact and if so are there specific trends that we found like certain exploration swaps or certain entities in the swaps or anything like that? So that's a really good question I really love the caveats you give there because I don't know if you watched my swap videos on GameStop I did back in June but I said the exact same thing I was like look guys I would love it if they if I could perfectly predict GameStop's price movement from these swaps but the caveat that I gave obviously was the problem with these instruments is that because of the opacity of the counterparties we don't know how much is hedged and so if you have a total return swap where you have a prime broker and a hedge fund and the hedge fund says I want to get exposure I want to get synthetic exposure you know short exposure to GameStop but I don't want to actively go out and short the shares can you do that for me and then I'll you know set up this swap where I'll pay you a fixed interest rate above prime and give up these other socks as collateral and then you can basically give me exposure and pay me anytime GameStop you know collapses the prime broker could either hedge their position 100% they could hedge their position 50% they could hedge their position 0% like no one no one knows and so because that data is not available the problem with these swaps is that some of the swaps can be huge we're talking billions of dollars they can come up and if they were fully hedged on expiry or if they get rolled over they just roll over and then nothing happens to the price because the the prime broker right the the hedging entity in this case never actually has to go out and buy the shares to you know cover a liability because a they they already have them or be they can just roll it over and so when we look at when we look at the like the actual swapped data it's it's very important to be mindful that you know as much as you want to be like so hit the hope you and pipe and say hey this is this is an absolute guarantee of where the price will go in the next you know two one month two month three months here's the times when it will spike buy options right before sell at the top then buy puts let let the short short it back down and then you'll just profit if I had that money making machine I wouldn't be here talking to you guys unfortunately I'd probably be on a beach into heady uh sitting around with millions of dollars and so um yeah they're not like these cycles are not uh they're not predictive enough to actually make make movements on now what is really interesting about the swaps is there there's a couple things so first is that almost all the swaps are not pure uh what you call like a pure total return swap which is where they're based on a single security they're almost always portfolio swaps or basket swaps so what the entity is doing is they're not just short in game stop they're shorting a basket of stocks and then they're also hedging it with longs that are another basket of different stocks and this is exactly what Bill Hoang did so if you use him as an example right he created total yeah he created total return swaps which were basket swaps which were long viacom paramount and then a bunch of Chinese stocks and then he was short game stop AMC and a bunch of retailers that he thought were going to go down in 2020 you know 2019 2020 and 2021 and so the problem that he ran into and why he got like his capital got just absolutely destroyed so quickly like he lost I think what eight billion dollars in a single day is because not only did his shorts uh in his swap his swap move against him longs also did so viacom paramount all those stocks had entered bubble territory in you know February of 2021 and they all started correcting hard and he got margin cold on both ends of the swap and he could not obviously uh cough up the collateral because he leveraged his firm something like eight or nine to one on on the base equity and so you know he was just blowing up and then now there's this huge toxic bag of of liabilities that the banks have right all these shorts on companies that were that are are racing higher like gm e i don't know exactly the is his short position amount but given on the excess capital premium right he probably entered around $10 $20 and the price was $300 in 2021 and so he was deeply short on his gm e shorts are deeply underwater and then his viacom and paramount stocks were were down like 30% in the space of two months and so he was just obliterated now these banks are holding these liabilities and they have to figure out what to do so um yeah it's been a long story short like what's interesting I haven't done a deep deep dive on the you know like analyzing oh is our total return swaps better at you know maybe slightly better predicting price you know do they have a point to correlation with price and the uh or folio swaps have a point one correlation with price like is there any relationship there I haven't gone that deep into the data yet but I do know that from my look of it there's it was never a single a single gm e swap that was just pure gm e it was always basket or total return um or total portfolio swaps um and they almost always had the long end of the swap uh either denominated usd or euros and they were also holding you know large cap us stock as as like collateral so it was like when I looked at it it was apple microsoft tesla things like that like things and in video to like things that they expected to continually go up do you do you have like a reliable source for as comprehensive of a data set of the swaps because I only have pieces of it and I haven't found something that I fully trust but if either of you do I literally is weird as this is to say verbally I would love to do the analysis on it because like I love looking at this stuff I just haven't found like a solid data source yet that like I fully trust that it's comprehensive enough to be able to walk away with conclusions sure I mean I have like here I can even let me pull it up I still have the old gm emmaster archive as well as that would be super helpful and then in the meantime for for those hanging out in the chat first thanks for coming in taking it with us talking about game stop a little bit a big reason why I think game stop is super cool is because it connects people from lots of different backgrounds right like even the the group that we have here and for me I will always be a trader and a big part of what I try to do is objectively analyze things so that's actually what I hope to do with with some of the swaps is to to be able to just literally regress it and then see what what actually shows because my guess is that there might be so I don't think swaps writ large I haven't found really predictive qualities around that yet but one of my further guess is that some of the sub qualities of the swaps might be predictive but I don't have a large enough data set that I trust enough yet yeah absolutely I mean I've I've gotten was it Linux and then what's the name of the other there's another guy on Twitter who was able to script the data for me and send it to me yeah I can hit you up and see see what we can get and then for those in the chat if there's anything in particular that you want to ask any of the dudes you could start throwing them in now we probably have like maybe 10 15 minutes or so I don't want to take too much of these guys this time but as always I'm stoked to chat with you guys well you guys can I can I can show you if you want to look at the swap data right now I can I can share the screen yeah we'd love to sure so let me make sure I'm sharing the right screen just a second oh no let us see the other screen let us see the screen with all the ground lens yeah you'd I want to know what your sources are I want to know yeah let's get through that search history yeah well now I might my search is pretty boring but yeah so for us three you want to you want to learn about you know the history of central banking and you know all the yeah how to monetize a YouTube channel that's those my two main searches and how far back does this go so okay so like this one goes back to 2020 I believe 2022 it looks like I see 19 in my let me what's concave we don't spend too much time on this because I can parse through this execution execution time stamp so when the swap was actually executed yeah okay yeah but again like this is initiator closed when you mean executed yeah executed means initiated I believe yeah yeah because so some of these are so interesting is like some of these will show like I actually was able to dig through the data and for some reason my other excel file where actually like broke this all down all got corrupted so I like I had this all organized to make it look really good and so you could understand it but in June but when I reopened it was like gone and so I was like oh shit so this is like the original file but so what you can see with some of these like what's really interesting is some of these will be callbacks and again you'd have like scroll all the way through this to find which ones are like that but some of these are like callbacks where you'll see like the execution time stamp you know and the event time stamp be different so it'll be you know like a basically like the event happens on you know let's say like January of 2021 like January 5th and then you'll see basically like a callback to another swap so it rolls over and says January 5th 2022 and says executed and then and then some of these will lack a you know lack some of these time stamps so those ones are sometimes the like if they're like increased or termination they're sometimes like mismatched because you see that like they're basically being rolled over they're being canceled or they're being swapped for something else but the data is hard to parse out because again it's been hard to find people like okay these are examples where these are like corrected ones right so these are corrected swaps so there's no event time stamp but there's an execution time stamp so you know that like these are older swaps and the as you can see here I'll zoom in these are all basket right basket swaps up here it was all oh oops that's too much up here it was all equity it was contract for difference I believe yeah so look at that these are all contract for difference so C of Ds are kind of similar to single stock swaps and that they're just like you basically get paid on the performance of security and not you don't actually have exposure real exposure to the underlying but what's hard about this right is I you know I've worked in finance but I've never seen data like this and I've reached out to people on Twitter and there's no one that's willing to help me like understand exactly what all these what all these things mean yeah but yeah I probably in the last guy to help you understand what it means but what I can do is very easily identify relationships between these things and movements which again I'm I'm the village idiot now it's like I'm trying to trade so if I can find stuff that leads me to tradable ideas that that's how I prime my brain but at honestly as I'm going through a joking aside I can probably parse through a bit of this so yeah if you don't mind I'd love to get a copy of this from you and then I can start start running it through what I have but I think we'll be able to at least understand yeah or nay just different qualities of this and then subsequent impact because another thing is all of you know when analyzing something like the stock market it's really difficult because it's multi-variant so even if there's some sort of correlation between this coming up in some degree and then price movement there also can be other stuff at least the price movement so what I do is I keep a track of like all key events so then I can overlap like is there a news event that happened to come on that day as well so that we can try to actually get to a decent the decent answer so yeah so through this yes so this is exactly what I was talking about so you see the contract for differences are like those are like the single entity swaps that are all this gm and the dot dot and stands for NYSE for North America so it's like a denominator that shows like this is literally American gm east stock because there's gm that trades in Europe or in other other countries but when we get down to the basket or portfolio swaps you can see here like the long end of the this is the what's it called I should prove you a new I'm like stands for a New York Stockings change what new stands for New York Stockings change and and stands for NYSE yeah New York Stockings change that's that's what I was told by someone who's who's traded you know derivatives before they're like oh yeah that's a denominator that helps the it's like an internal back end thing to make sure that they know it's that for NYSE not gm on another exchange we can see here like look you see the underlier lake one AMC chipotle coin base I don't know what DT is I don't know what N is but five in OQ gm or oh the N is the sorry that's obviously the gm e dot N proven we can't see what you're on right now yeah you're on termination right now wait really yeah it's like a sharing part of your screen wait let me try to be sure we could see the cursor now you see the cursor going but whatever screen you're on that's why I was asking about the new because you were on new when he said new there you go can you see this now yeah you see it okay yeah put it up put it on a letter on a letter are you on the right side of an end no I'm just making sure your cursor is in the right spot yeah so you're gm e dot N yeah so these are so yeah for a large part of the spreadsheet these are these contract for differences which are these like again similar to a single swap a single equity but when we get to the portfolio swaps or the basket swaps you can see here so it's AMC dot N so that's AMC us chipotle right coin base dot OQ DT I don't know what DT is I don't know what stock F is is that forward yeah forward five in I don't know that one and then you see gm e here again and then you see grab and so a lot of these swaps will have like again you'll see like massive chunks of them that are just the same you know it's like the same basket of five or eight stocks that they're shorting or that they're long or whatever and here's another one same same thing just slightly different order yeah you just see like the same thing over and over again oh here's one with a gm e and robin hood and I don't know what grab is if you guys know what that is or five in but yeah whoever this is they're shorting obviously a basket of of entire stocks and then some of them will have a long leg of the like it's a portfolio swap that's structured in a way where they will actually have a long and a short end of the swap and then you'll see their longs and again what I've seen historically that the longs are like Nvidia Tesla Apple Microsoft it's like the big the big name blue chip tech stocks and from this just said a curiosity how do we know that there's a long and short or are we just coming up with a reasonable assumption based off of what we can see here it's just a basket yeah it's that's what I thought I just wanted to make sure as I'm going through this it's because yeah underlier leg one is is usually the you know the collateral that they're requesting right it's like that's the the first leg of the swap is what they want to receive shares of this and so the assumption is the entity who is originating this swap who is asking for the swap to be created is short these companies and they're asking for a stream of you know it would be select synthetic exposure to these shares and so because this is the first leg that's all in the broader point I just I was certifying the difference between like knowing like we know and improve versus we're making a a reasonable assumption which it sounds like we're just making an assumption which is a reasonable assumption yeah yeah cool yeah all right awesome let me yeah I would love to grab a copy of that though that would be absolutely sick I can send it over sure yeah cool and then I want to go on in the comments just say hey Zeus said is this like CDOs yeah it's exactly like that at the end of the big short where nobody can figure out what the hell is going on is a hundred times bigger than you think yes and Aaron said earlier with the data and everything you'll never see all of it you'll never you can't tell at the end what was closed or rolled for a few months as far as like ins and data because you doesn't take that long and you can report tens of billions of trades wrongly or not at all that just came out between 2013 and 21 for Citadel so I just don't know all the data you just pay a few pennies yeah ten years ten years later yep so yeah that's what data is like the ones that have to report it's kind of like hedge funds or individual institute or individual investors that are shorting something when you see short flow as far as what's reported just remember that every single top brokerage gets fine for misreporting every single year what they don't do is on right and they're doing that for a reason on certain exact equities yeah we mean and and there's a red at a bit's work but at a bit did like a really good deep dive on like you know it was like Goldman Sachs Bank of America like you know Jeffries like all these investment and commercial banks that have been miss marking you know long sales or short sales as long they've been misallocating customer uh securities to cover their own positions they've been misreporting short positions I mean it's it's literally like once you start reading it and it's like you go through page and page and page and page and page of lawsuit from the SEC and then they only get a few million dollar fine or 20 million dollar fine and no one ever goes to jail you realize that this is it's in the end to the industry I mean this is what they do professionally basically yeah I go ahead yeah I was just going to say I was running through the comments here I was going to grab a couple of those if you guys are ready for a few of those sure sweet um one of them is one that I've actually spent a while taking looking taking a look at from Fosity and it says do you think kitty has methods to perfectly time his trades that we haven't completely figured out or is he buying leaps and waiting and um all I'm sure I'll start you guys can pile on whenever you want but um I look through I call it finger printing you can come up with a way that different institutions entities tend to do business and like I said we went through literally every single one of his trades and it's possible it is possible I can't prove one way or the other but what I can say is there's nothing based on what we've seen from what he's posted that would indicate that being the case because if somebody has the ability to perfectly time stuff based on what he's posted his portfolio is gone through 60% drawdowns 80% drawdowns then doubling in a half two days later like that's not a a function of perfect timing he's held through periods where if he captured profit he would realize more money than during the subsequent drop can buy in with even more that being said the natural question is where does a quarter billion dollars come from and that's why I think it's reasonable to say it's possible so the my thought on that question specifically is that we can't tell specifically because nobody has a look inside his book I've not seen all of his trades so I couldn't tell you but based on what I have seen from what he has posted it does not seem to be the case to me but I don't know if you guys have an opinion on that one I don't think Rory and Kitty has to worry about any cycles or anything anymore with his power of posting as far as I like that power of posting like he's got the golden ticket with no market manipulation posting a picture of a time magazine like everyone's like was commenting on my post about you know buying the 30-hour calls 10 seconds or 10 minutes before the market closed on a Friday like oh yeah I'm sure he wants to go to jail and I'd be like try and prove market manipulation on that like it took five years to prove it on Elon and make him pay a fine that he actually posted we have a buyout for this price that is 100% market manipulation on a tweet like someone's gonna buy out a Tesla for more 20 to share posting a picture of a cat and a stock goes up but if he didn't place any trades or if he bought them a couple days before yeah there's nothing to that so his in my opinion his strategies changed into one that's less frequent perfectly timed and is going off of just his holdings he'll post his yellow when he's ready and then it will probably be after a month or more after he's placed these trades with a random tweet but he doesn't want to be on the hook for you know buying everything before a yellow post that'd be different than a random meme because he's shown his positions so you know going through his post for the last couple of years he was onto the cycles onto the short interest and everything early but in my opinion now it's just going off of his power and the other thing too right is like even if he is saying hey I really like GameStop you know I think it's an attractive investment or something like that that's not illegal right I mean Jim Kramer goes on TV every school day and says apples a buy and he has like a giant butt buzzes by and he smashes and he says go buy Apple if you're you know if you're smart if you know it's good for you or sell micro strategies or Bitcoin sell it sell it sell it and there's never any investigation onto you know what his actual portfolio moves are he found a loophole with his charitable fund exactly that's the day I started my charity was that I might actually be able to give I mean I had this goal forever of getting personal finance into schools as ridiculous we learned how to line dance and play the recorder instead of learning about money it's all part of the plan yeah but I started like I hit the button to go file for a charity because once the fund grew big enough I could post positions that the charity could go into or not and it's not going to be from myself or financial advice or from my firm has a fiduciary but it's going to be for charity what we think is best for that fund and what positions we go into or get out of I was just going to mere creamer but do the right thing instead of read off the teleprompter. Started to see too like the the edham flow of that like what it actually materializes into why not that's fun like over yeah it's sick I have one more question from the chat that I think will be fun for us to end on it's very thematic this one's from yesterday in gaming it could be today in gaming but it's specifically yesterday in gaming by the way what exactly would it take for the shorts to finally be forced to close what's the checkmate how is closure achieved emotional and financial now one quick caveat obviously something like emotional closure is one in the entirely that's up to the person's side never be exactly you probably never know what we just got but from a structural question on what eventually short causes the shorts to close I think that's a great question so what do you guys think so yeah do I mean did it go ahead so I've been you know I've been banging the the drum on Twitter for this for a while but look I think there are two things or I'd maybe say three-manager catalyst for closure right one is the actual bankruptcy of of these funds and the force you know float like basically a force wind down of of these entities that have been short game stop and the liquidation of their assets and the closing of their liabilities which would be closing the short positions the other would be regulatory crackdown across the sector which would require right the SEC to be completely reformed for them to ruthlessly go after all shorts for them to scrape through this continuous net settlement system of the DTC's internal data logs and find out who is short and basically go with you know policemen and FBI agents and go to those firms and say I gunpoint you know you are closing today or you're you're you're being arrested and you're going to jail for life like that's the non-negotiable and then the third is price action so as we've seen like whenever the price has moved to too too high and too fast we have seen pressure on the shorts to begin closing again like there was some short closing in jk of 2021 there was some short closing in in March but it was minuscule compared to the overall value it was like less than 10 percent but there was some and so we know that when these when these price mechanisms get distorted when the price starts to just rip and rip and rip there is you know there are obviously like risk management out goes in the market that start forcibly closing closing including that's something that for start forcibly closing positions against the will of the hedge fund that is short that's why Melvin capital blew up so people will say that we have no impact on the market that's completely wrong we do absolutely the question is how do we get that price action how do we get the price to move it upwards in a very you know aggressive and rapid fashion and I think one of the ways that that games up could do this is by acquiring Bitcoin and essentially following the micro strategies you know strategy per se right by adopting yeah intelligent level but they could do it a better way because micro strategy is like the Dgen you know crypto gamblers just just issuing billions of dollars a debt and smash buying Bitcoin yeah dude as soon as we're going down a little bit micro strategy is gonna they're gonna have fun oh yeah and they already have like my MSTR has done like 330 like there are I don't people bought the top in the options at 440 and I bought some options I sold them in the 400 range most of them I have one one call that I'm holding on to the rest of my January calls I was like dude there's too much risk on the table here I cannot hold on to this yeah but but overall like the strategy has worked micro strategies has had like a 2000 percent increase since August of 2020 so it has worked and so if games up could do that but in a much more you know maybe measured and less crypto in a sustainable yeah if they would just buy a 500 million of of Bitcoin and say hey some of this you know 20% of this excess cash we're gonna put towards Bitcoin and any XS profits we have half of them will go into Bitcoin the rest will go into cash balance that would be a completely reasonable and affordable with for them to DCA into Bitcoin and gain Bitcoin exposure and potentially add a huge upside catalyst to their price so that's what I've been been talking about and actually I have a group of people that I'm working with and we're working on drafting the proposals to the board to formally ask them to to consider this strategy well as long as the word yellow is in there I don't see how they get denied just yeah just absolutely um I got a bounce in like 10 minutes but I know Kevin there is a couple of of the things you wanted to hit before we wrap up so I'd love to do that but I'd also love to comment quickly on the fact that seems like a lot of people have some sort of issue that you have a a green screen meanwhile I'm sitting with a fucking t-shirt and a halo above my head so I think you look great I think the screen looks good so yeah you're welcome I built this office today yeah that's good with your own hands that's the secret yeah as long as you build it they will come yeah I had this dartboard that just showed it up too in my office because I realized I loved darks and for some reason when the suns are blasting my eyes I switched positions and now my dartboard comes through completely clear uh before I get my question either of you guys see the data on the four nine the five ninety four put on spy yesterday went from a penny to eleven dollars in twenty three cents a hundred thousand percent gain yesterday and I was like this well there's no way I'm bent on it because I've tracked every single fed medium for like four years and usually it's a theta gang day like if the market's up and the fed medium happens it closes flat if it's down the fed medium happens it closes flat to just because it's higher IV for the fed day right with rising and lowering interest rates and then yesterday just imploded for absolutely no reason I mean I was stoked it happened but they haven't missed a prediction in like forty years on fed rate cuts or raises and so it was all priced in and then the market has its worst day in years I'm like okay well this is probably something but my question for you guys going way back in this call to the community of GameStop what is your best theory on why GameStop discontinued its logo clothing besides my theory of rebranding what's your best theory on why they wouldn't sell these anymore and they went extinct first because I don't have an educated opinion on it so I'm going to shut my fucking mouth and give it to PV on what specifically sorry all the clothing's gone it's been gone for 10 months there's a million shareholders out there that loved buying it and wearing it some a bunch of shields in the comments on my posts we're saying low margins and stuff but when you buy a million t-shirts from China and pretty sure margins are like 75% profit on the corner why did they stop them completely I don't know I mean what are the questions what are they selling like shorts like workout shorts no yeah you wanted it t-shirts sweatshirts socks shorts wet pants they had a bunch of merchandise here that people were buying hand or a fist they almost always said sold out and you had to go find them in like a physical store why would you stop making them okay I don't know I mean maybe their excuses like overhead or like having too many employees manage it but I feel like that would be a really easy thing to manage and I'll even Carol manages his own like clothing store like by himself and it's not that and they've distribution centers too so they don't really have to do it and they're sold out online every time like the white sweatshirts or something came back they're gone within like hours because everyone's posting online buying them that fast it was going to say to your point Kevin to further the question and speculation typically people that move the merch have really strong communities that want to merge and I can't think of yeah companies with a much pre-advertising right so yeah that's a great question Kevin PB what's the answer I don't know I don't I get well I would love us can't we can't both know it just makes something up at this point that's why I said rebranding is my theory on it why would else get rid of it when everyone's buying it instantly as soon as you get new in stock online I don't know about Swarons because I can't see that but the I don't know the the question I offer with that is like if so why not can because how long has it been out off the shelves you said for some time now March it's a lot of misrevenue for rebrands like typically if somebody's going to do a rebrand you produce up until you go through the rebrand you say this is the last that you're going to get these and like you don't know what's that unless the rebrand wasn't ready yet right and I'm not a tin foil person but yeah the point the point I'm thinking of is that you don't have to stop selling old brand before rebrand I think you can rebrands still sell old brand and then so your your thought is they were preparing for rebrands stop selling rebrand wasn't ready and then just didn't start selling again just kind of let it go dormant yeah there could have been this this massive announcement coming for what it's going to be in you know personally if I own if I was running going or I own GameStop I wouldn't rebrand because in 2021 more people on earth knew what GameStop was than Apple probably because of the news articles but if they were going in that direction then there could have been deals that fell through timing I know I've seen a lot of data and write-ups on Ryan Cohen's insider trading lawsuit that was going through a bad bath and beyond and the Wells Fargo fine of not reporting correctly because there's 8,000 loopholes you have to go through to report something perfectly for an SEC report and he didn't know I do it when he sold Chilly and bought Apple and Wells Fargo and they found out five years later he typed something up wrong for that million dollar fines there could have been things that delayed it and then we just saw the partnership a month ago with PSA and Nat Turner coming on you know it could have been there's obviously a merger and acquisition is usually extremely secret and takes a lot of time before that article comes out for the filing and so they're easily could have been things where they could have pulled out maybe something they wanted to buy was found out to be fraudulent or you know there's a million things that could happen but I cannot I am I mean I stay up at night trying to figure out why to stop doing it be stides they were planning on it very soon because it stopped in like March and so maybe May it was going to come out and when the stock went up 800 percent they're like hmm this is going to be a ton of lawsuits and crap coming out because the stock just went up 800 percent and roaring kiddies back and everything so they're like okay it was delay this another 30 days run up happens in June as well let's delay it and then into July and August was the Wells Fargo stuff on Ryan Cohen my prediction was that they were going to announce in May something but they're not going to do that for the stock manipulation they were going to wrecked you know SEC, Fandra everyone the work sir is also sorry a lot of people that it work and run both of those entities have worked in the very highest up of finance so if you could find GameStop as much as possible to probably get the calls to do so and Ryan probably sees that so that's my theory on why to stop selling all GameStop branded clothing. It's definitely better than mine I if I was a business and they were selling well I would still run it all the way up until whatever the new stunts and just stop production but I'm not the guy that's going to collectible item yeah I got to run I have dinner with my mom and if I'm late I'll probably get a wooden spoon chuck my way but absolutely awesome absolutely awesome hanging out with you guys for those that are in the chat thank you guys for hanging out and then for PB you have your YouTube channel and then you're also on X do you want to let people know where they can find it?
