0.00s: like we are live. What is up everybody? Hopefully we got apes, outliers, glorious mix there of.
7.68s: You guys will have to forgive the screen and set up a my end. I am on the mobile setup right now.
12.48s: I'm hanging out in New York and we got our boys PB with his ever-evolving backdrop that is
18.32s: becoming more and more chic and then we got Kevin and I am absolutely stoked to get a chance to
23.76s: me with you. I've been watching your material, like your tweets and stuff and I just really like the
29.20s: content that you're putting out and stuff you're talking about. So stoked to get a chance to chat with you.
33.12s: Yeah, appreciate it man. Thanks for having me on. Beautiful. So the overall
40.16s: background I've ran into GameStop just to the table set super fast is I've been a trader for this is
48.96s: my 17th year of trading. I started back when I was in high school. Super super lucky. The guys
52.64s: saw some staying in right now is actually the dude that introduced me to investing and he sent me
56.80s: down a completely different life path and I've traded GameStop before but from an options trading
63.12s: perspective which is super volatile. Lots of movement for me to be able to trade and then this
68.96s: most recent move that we had in the spring, May, June, like that time frame. I started seeing
74.56s: unusual options activity kicking up again. Volume starting to kick up and so it started trading it.
78.72s: Now at this point though, I had a YouTube channel which is completely different. I'm looking at it
83.76s: with the different lens. There's people that are explaining a lot of what's going on and then
88.24s: this is now the 20 26th episode of me doing like specific videos about this. So it's that's at least
96.56s: 30 hours in live streams alone just exploring GameStop beyond all the research I've been doing.
102.16s: So I am infatuated by the whole saga. I would love to hear Kevin from your perspective a little
110.80s: bit about how you found your way into GameStop because you also come from a bit of a more professional
116.80s: background as you can tell because I'm a dude in a t-shirt and you're looking fine a f in your suit.
121.92s: So I would love to learn how you got into GameStop and like what your general lens is there.
128.08s: I got into GameStop right after COVID hit and I was just researching all and screening all the
142.00s: companies that I've just gotten obliterated by the news and the pandemic seeing what opportunities
147.92s: were out there. Things that aren't going to go bankrupt. Things that will survive in this pandemic.
156.96s: And when I was screening them I noticed that GameStop had 99.99% short float reported.
168.48s: And so I was like what? Who would do that? So I called the info company and or the company that I
178.00s: got my data from and asked them is this the real short interest or is this the highest your numbers can
188.56s: go on the data screen and they said that's the highest or numbers can go and I was just like
195.12s: oh my god this only takes one news article to explode. So I started getting all my clients into a
202.72s: small position at you know split adjusted a dollar a share and you know just waiting it out over
215.68s: the summer kind of bounced flat and then Ryan Cohen comes in as the largest holder and
227.28s: buys a significant portion of the company and I was like that's the news that's going to send this.
234.08s: And from that day on the cycle started I'm then not being able to find shares started going up.
245.28s: I can't say that part because it's going to be in our documentary but then January 21
251.20s: happens. I left Edward Jones I was at Edward Jones at that time my clients were top 10 shareholder of
260.32s: GameStop in 2020 before the sneeze and then after January left Jones and opened up my own
272.48s: firm and the rest is kind of history from there that's how I found it. I was talking with Keith
282.08s: Gill and other people in 2020 going over the strategy the deep value everything like that and it's
289.36s: crazy because I didn't know Keith was also a financial professional and then once everything came out
297.76s: and him getting called into Congress are pretty much just white internet clean. I was like I don't know
306.40s: the sound fun to me. Yeah fascinating and then just one quick follow up for you specifically
313.44s: from a professional investing slash trading background you obviously were working with clients and
319.92s: one of the things you were working with your clients is this GameStop position prospectively
325.28s: and was that something at the time that was like a hard sell or was it something that you already
330.96s: did in different kinds of forms with other positions and this was just another one of those types.
336.64s: Another one of those types I had an I have an eye for a anomalies and noticing like things are
345.04s: off or things are on like chart patterns and so my clients before it had these crazy positions or
353.52s: short squeezes that had ended up being 5x to 15x money just based on me researching so much. My
362.64s: father who was also a financial advisor in my entire life I'm a second-gen he called me and
369.12s: after I sent him one of my white papers he's like God you you should have been an analyst but
375.52s: they don't make any money. I was like yeah I just weirdly have a passion for research
382.48s: like the three of us all do and I just nailed in on my niche once we could
390.08s: once commissions were kind of gone and manage money started where you know percentage of the
396.56s: portfolio value I realized I could use all my research to grow my clients money which would
405.60s: literally benefit me and more money they make more money I make and love the strategy took
410.56s: all the pressure off of them because Jones was still the highest commission probably in the United
415.68s: States that 2% buys or sells for stock so you know 100,000 or buy of Apple they had to pay 2 grand
423.28s: in commission for it so once I was calling clients to you know what sell this to buy this
430.08s: they know that that called made me zero dollars cost them zero dollars and I only think it's the
437.44s: best thing for them because I get nothing out of it except for their portfolio performance.
446.64s: I figured the the next thing I wanted to talk about because PB I've had a chance to pick your
450.56s: brain a bit about how you got involved in game stuff and like the history so I thought we could
456.24s: just change gears for a minute and do a bit of a current state assessment. I'd love to hear
462.96s: really from both of you but we could start with PB to get a sense of just where we are with game
468.64s: stop today and what your general thoughts are about price action how things are positioned
473.04s: don't have to go into whether or not you think that there's a squeeze coming or anything like that
476.96s: like just overall level setting and then just one other admin note for the question
482.32s: I very much view myself as like a guest in the ape house because I know that there's people
489.04s: have been in this thing for four years now and that's not my path right I'm a traitor I'm in
494.80s: an out of things so I really like to be able to understand the perspective of people
500.40s: and PB and I have had a chance to talk to a few times so I've also been able to see the arc of his
506.40s: perspective which hopefully have a chance to understand yours as well and the evolution of the
511.68s: Kevin but PB current state of game stop where we have sure so I think this year especially as
519.92s: we're closing out 2024 it's been a very transformative year for game stop you know we've had
525.44s: basically two prior years of almost like a slow steady grind in both stock price and also
532.00s: company performance Ryan Cohen was essentially committed to making game stop cashful positive and
539.12s: to stop seeing bleeding losses every single year you know he wanted this this overall business
545.28s: transformation to take place but it's taken longer than he's wanted to and so he's had to let go
550.96s: of you know executives he's appointed he's made some blunders right they did the crypto marketplace
557.92s: which kind of fell apart and didn't provide enough revenue and so he was trying to write like
563.76s: he was trying to justify his investment is trying to say like look this company was bleeding but we
568.24s: can turn it around we can fix these these problems and you know finally this year they've been
573.92s: able to make it cashful positive and you know reduce SG&A enough to actually make the margins
580.16s: worth it and a lot a large part of that means closing stores I think something like 20% of the stores
585.92s: they've closed and so their overall square footage has reduced and then so has their net sales
590.64s: but the benefit with that is you know becoming profitable is obviously more valuable than just
597.28s: being a bigger company that's unprofitable and that's bleeding every single quarter and so this year
603.60s: sorry I just had a question on that for the store closures is that mostly been in Europe
608.00s: it in my remember in that crackler is that also like 50 50 split I thought it was mostly Europe I
613.12s: just don't remember I think it is mostly Europe but there are some there are some closures in the
617.76s: us as far as I know and I haven't looked at the breakdown I just know it's around 22% of total
622.80s: square footage has been lost since like 2021 I think thank you so and maybe Kevin you can fact
628.56s: check me on that number if you know it's different but this year right like we saw DFB return
636.80s: in a big way and we saw the gamma squeeze and you know the short squeeze thesis kind of play out
642.40s: again and game shop was able to take advantage of this price action you know pretty
648.32s: pretty adeptly and and raise a huge amount of capital from share offerings so they did first the
655.52s: the initial share offering in in May in ATM which was around I think like you know between 40 and
663.36s: $30 per share and then they did which raised you know like one or two one and a half billion I
669.12s: think and then they did another share offering in June when DFB started tweeting again and and the
674.16s: game around built even stronger we saw the price skyrocket to like $80 share and games up did another
681.52s: ATM they started you know selling at you know huge amounts of of of shares and and raising you know
689.28s: up to what they have now is 4.5 and change billion dollars of cash and so you know we've known for a
696.40s: while that Ryan Cohen not only wanted to just save this company from dying he actually wanted to
700.88s: transform it into you know you could call it like a chewy like business right and online e-commerce
709.28s: company that could compete with like a sub amazon and now with this cash on hand they actually
714.40s: finally have the ability to to make this reality and a large part of this speculation online has been
720.88s: right like they're going to use this cash as a tool to acquire other companies and then those
725.84s: companies hopefully have synergy with game stops legacy business and then that can help propel them
731.68s: you know in the coming years and quarters to further success but the problem that we've
737.12s: obviously run into is we haven't seen what that is yet we don't know and so it's the same thing I
741.28s: said back in October I think right like we're still kind of waiting on our hands and they haven't
745.76s: given any indication as to what exactly they are going to do with the money now if you read like
752.96s: the financial statements the 10 q's and then the earning reports the one thing they've said
758.16s: consistently since they raised this cash is they've said they will use it for general
764.08s: corporate purposes and and and and or including merges and acquisitions and they include that
769.84s: exact phrase in every single statement they've put out so they're kind of hinting that they're
774.88s: looking at this but again until they actually make the move we don't know and they probably want to
779.20s: keep that right on the down low as long as possible yeah and that makes it ton of sense too because I
784.88s: mean companies like that when they raise cash typically it's for a reason of some sort to your point
790.16s: really opportunistic raise but yeah sitting on a pile of cash as a company it's only so good until
796.00s: you find a way to you know generate revenue from it so interesting update thank you and then
800.88s: um Kevin I'd love to to hear your current perspective of just where the company is and
807.92s: from from you Kevin I if you don't mind I would also love to understand from like your involvement
813.36s: in 2020 and your perspective at that time how is it shifted to where we are today just because I
820.32s: like I don't know I enjoy understanding more the details on like the arc of analysis
824.16s: sure um I'll start off really quick by answering uh approbions as of February GameStop still had
835.84s: 41 69 stores open um they closed over 1100 so with the news on Europe's closures
848.80s: were probably sitting close to 1500 closed and 36 and so third are going to be closing um we don't
858.56s: know that number until next earnings comes out for the quarter uh as far as GameStop right now and
868.88s: last piggyback on approbions in the wording of the report with their cash by how they can also
875.84s: buy marketable securities which is at the full discretion of Ryan Cohen so they can now
883.36s: pretty much be a holding company of individual stock I've not found out
890.64s: anyone that can prove my loophole wrong about them swing trading their own stock
899.12s: under that wording of marketable securities so usually when a company buys back stock they
907.12s: retire those shares and it you know goes lower and lower and lower but there's nothing saying
914.00s: they can't buy shares of their own company not retire them and then sell them for profit
920.80s: so that was by far the most exciting thing that I noticed in the wording that I could not
926.48s: figure out the answers to as far as GameStop now compared to 2020 at that time short squeeze play
934.40s: anything that's shorted 99.99 or more I just saw it as you know this thing just needs one catalyst
943.68s: and I would not buy brick and mortar for my clients at that time I'm like you know for years
948.08s: they're asking hey let's buy a sear it's down 90% or these companies and I'm like you really
953.44s: want to compete with Amazon like are you gonna order more stuff from Sears or buy more stuff in Sears
958.96s: or order stuff on Amazon this month but the short squeeze play in the last four years turned into
964.64s: a complete turnaround of a profitable company nobody on Wall Street no analyst thought it could ever
970.16s: be done and now with even more unprofitable source closed the profitability is just gonna grow
979.12s: can't guarantee that but if they do everything exactly the same then profitability would grow
985.92s: on the next earnings report and they have this cash pile now that number one I agree with
994.72s: through and they don't want to say what they're gonna use it for give any hints and if they don't
1000.16s: have any backdoor ideas right now then Ryan Cohen and GameStop is sitting on a higher cash
1007.60s: percentage than Berkshire Hathaway right now with markets at all time highs so wait for dip crash
1016.00s: whatever it is to buy cheaper really good companies for mergers and acquisitions or with the marketable
1022.80s: securities you know buy Apple the next time it's right it drops 33% or Tesla next time it drops 70%
1030.88s: or Nvidia the next time it drops 70% and so he's got this word chest not only profitability but
1039.44s: cash that is back ended up going into a possible market downturn to deploy at that time
1050.40s: you can see whoever feels like answering one of the the conversations that's been floating around
1054.96s: a lot is the idea of a holding company and different ways that that could look so from your perspectives
1064.32s: trying to perceive what RC might be trying to configure obviously it's a guess nobody fully
1072.32s: knows but looking at it from looking at the game from his perspective what do you guys think he
1079.12s: might be trying to structure if he goes the route of a holding company what might that actually look
1085.28s: well Kevin I'm sure you could I'm not sure how much you can you can talk about this but you know
1093.12s: there's a lot of there's a lot of conspiracy theories about what's going on and there's some evidence
1098.08s: there's some like tangential evidence that seems to support some of the theories right there's
1101.44s: just there's also not enough to fully confirm anything so we can't say for sure but one of the
1107.92s: main ones is that he wants to create almost like a kiritzu style you know business co-op that
1118.08s: basically entails a central counterparty like a bank and I think he's already you can
1126.56s: correct me if I'm wrong Kevin but I think he's already filed for Teddy corp to be a bank
1132.48s: and you know the goal is to make have this entity be like a loaning institution for this group
1140.96s: of companies that will work together synergistically to compete against Amazon and this comes from
1146.40s: the Japanese you know idea of a business that emerged in the wake of the 1940s after World War
1154.00s: 2 as Japan was starting to rebuild these you know kiritzuz were formed which were basically like
1160.96s: formal corporations between businesses to work together on pricing on on you know like logistics
1170.16s: transportation all those things so that the business could could effectively compete with offshore
1175.52s: entities in the US or in Europe and what this basically entailed is by the late 1980s right
1181.92s: Japan was a much more developed economy than before they'd experienced the most rapid economic
1187.20s: growth of any country in the 1980s and they also saw you know unfortunately the development of a bubble
1196.56s: but these business practices were fundamentally sound generally and they were adopted worldwide
1201.52s: and so the theory is with his you know with his creation of this Teddy bank entity and his
1211.36s: loaning of capital to bedbath and beyond and other you know small little tidbits of information
1219.20s: that we've been seeing that he's trying to form a kiritzu you know the other example is I don't
1225.12s: remember the name of that company but there's an international shipping conglomerate the CEO
1231.76s: what does it call it I'm blanking on it Kevin it's uh yeah anyways what
1239.28s: Zim Zim Zim is that the name of it okay but I think yes okay the CEO of that shipping company has
1249.04s: also been um in conversation with Ryan Cohen and like why would Ryan Cohen be talking to an
1256.00s: international logistics company if not for you know either acquisition or potential partnerships to
1262.56s: get credit global competitor to amazon someone just said in the comments flex port yes that's it
1270.00s: flex that's it yeah yeah shout out to you oh that's it itchy itchy go shout out to you so I
1279.52s: I got to tell you man like the chat in the community is probably one of the coolest things about
1284.00s: this whole thing cassettes that's how I found PB is they were like yo this other dude does a lot of
1290.08s: this stuff you should talk to him and they've been on point so shout out for the for the heads up
1296.16s: there um I don't know how much you can go in a by response or answer your thoughts on that Kevin but
1303.36s: I would love to hear your perspective as far as the holding company goes uh and the bank proven I
1314.80s: can't remember I can't remember if it was tin foil or if it was real on the teddy bank so I'm
1320.72s: just gonna leave it at that uh if I want his bank I do know that finally that's a bank is almost
1325.84s: impossible uh we saw so far and other companies try and do it for a very long time to be an FDIC
1334.32s: bank so a company not running yet I'm sure you can research it while I'm talking to see
1342.32s: if there's answers on that uh but as far as holding company goes to my understanding and the wording
1349.68s: on the earning reports over the last four quarters of marketable securities they can be a holding
1355.04s: company they don't have to even switch over to teddy to do a game stock can buy birkshire and
1362.72s: apple and google stock today and have it on their balance sheets um which should be a holding
1369.04s: company you know can go on rent uh I hate the words back because of you know everything that
1376.08s: happened but they have four point six billion dollars to deploy in any way that Ryan sees fit
1384.24s: and he's not gonna do it in a ridiculous way you know he is a penny cruncher
1392.88s: and I'm guessing besides or because nobody knows anything about him and he had no social media
1401.60s: or anything that probably works 120 hours a week like e-line too where his schedules are at five
1407.92s: minute intervals and sleeps an hour a night so I feel like he's going into this number one is main
1415.68s: goal was profitability and saving the company number two is going to be either building out to
1421.52s: maximize margins or buy out which I think you only do on dips from mergers and acquisitions
1429.36s: or be a holding company for the backdoor to buy game stock on cycles for other companies
1436.40s: that he sees fit or Bitcoin if he sees fit because now it's a marketable security
1445.28s: so kind of a wide a wide array of possibilities and I've seen a lot of people throwing out
1451.52s: different configurations the the thing I'm really interested in is to understand the way that RC
1459.92s: might be perceiving the landscape as it sits today and if one of those routes might look more appealing
1466.32s: to him than some of the other routes again all conjecture we don't know but it's I think an
1472.80s: interesting exercise to try to look at it from what he might be trying to roadmap out for the
1477.76s: company because the way that I saw him originally raising again raising those funds companies when
1484.16s: they're raising money like that it's typically for some sort of purpose not just the fact that it's
1488.40s: exceedingly advantageous timing which it was imagine as he was doing that he probably had some ideas
1494.40s: on you know what route he might want to take it now when you see game stop closing stores it starts
1502.40s: to show at least some sort of underlying change in the theme do you you guys think that the store
1510.32s: closure is going to continue and it's going to be a really core bubble of just the really
1515.60s: profitable brick and mortar stores to open up other business lines or do you guys see the brick and
1520.96s: mortar element shifting in some sort of way potentially even expanding?
1525.84s: Kevin you want to take that or I can take it?
1531.76s: I'll go I see it as unprofitability if it was your own company and you have
1540.48s: a hundred employees selling something if 30 of them have consistently lost money all the time
1548.24s: I'd close them out until I became profitable as a whole and now you know he's probably thinking
1555.36s: or gains on the entire board's probably thinking how many more do we close I mean international's
1562.88s: expensive and if not profitable and they're international it's probably a tough decision you know
1568.48s: we're bringing out of a country like that's just like the magazine that they dropped with like 20
1573.36s: million subscribers I can guess that it wasn't making money because we know what a point to that
1579.76s: so they'm canceling it was just to get as profitable as possible but now with the PSA partnership
1588.08s: and I posted about this before now they have a game stop store in almost every single city in
1595.76s: the United States as far as like a big city not a small town where people can go get their cards
1602.32s: graded and send them in and it's an instant profit for games off on these PSA gradients so now I
1612.32s: would believe that it's at a a standpoint of whether to close stores or keep ones open in certain
1622.24s: places where they see the PSA momentum growing the store is not profitable but they went from
1630.32s: 10 cars the first month to 100 to 1000 within three months getting graded they might keep that one open
1637.12s: if they saw no change in it and unprofitable they'll probably be like okay let's close this one
1642.40s: I think there'll be a lot more strategic with it same with Ryan going after shipping just like he did
1647.44s: with Chui he has a store in almost every big city with same-day shipping if you want to pay for it
1653.92s: so your PS5 can get delivered in three hours and so those are hubs across the entire United States
1661.60s: in every single town imagine a mini Amazon hub with just a specific source of inventory
1669.20s: they can be delivered to your house within a couple hours
1674.80s: so and you know the other thing too is like and I think you know Kevin you've you've talked to Ian
1680.48s: at length about this right and Ian does a really good job of laying this out that you know if you
1687.76s: look at Ryan Cohen's backstory right he was born in Canada he you know he really spends a lot of
1696.56s: time with his father and his family and for him like he you know gains a lot of lessons and
1705.76s: you know life advice from his dad and unfortunately his dad passes away but one of the things
1711.12s: or a couple of the things that his dad instilled in him was the value of hard work
1715.12s: and honesty and integrity right and so that's how he approached uh Chui so when he started Chui
1722.24s: you know well over a decade ago he wanted to take on Amazon because he felt that Amazon was
1726.80s: starting to become predatory in their practices and especially especially with regards to pets and
1733.12s: pet food so there were multiple and like the mid to late 2000s there were multiple outbreaks of
1739.52s: E. coli or food poisoning with the pet food that Amazon was selling Amazon was not doing quality
1744.64s: control from these suppliers in China and India and people's pets were getting a second die and
1750.40s: Amazon didn't care because again they're you know by this time in you know 2010 2011 they're
1755.52s: starting to run a you know multi-billion dollar business this is just one of the product lines
1759.84s: they have a small team of people that in customer support for the pet food section and so they
1764.80s: didn't really you know they didn't really care if people's pets were dying it's just a lawsuit
1769.84s: you settle for a couple hundred grand and you just move on and Ryan was you know obviously
1775.44s: in sense at this and he's been quoted in interviews as well as you know news pieces as saying like
1781.04s: this was one of the motivators to to push him to start Chui and so when he does start Chui he makes
1788.48s: it completely like it's like they pull their opposite of what Amazon is instead of focusing on
1792.80s: bottom line profitability focuses on the customer customer satisfaction he believes that customer
1798.08s: satisfaction will drive the bottom line you know not the other way around and so you know I mean
1803.04s: this this carries through to him sending literally like they send out letters or notes to people when
1809.76s: their pets pass away they can even send send out recurring birthday notes to people when they're
1816.72s: if they've noticed that they're they've been buying from Tweet consistently and they have a birthday
1820.40s: for their pet in on the website they'll send out a birthday notice and I know people who've gotten
1824.88s: that which again adds that personal touch and so you know in 2015 after Ryan Cohen had had sold
1832.08s: Chui and moved out you know of control of the company he was looking for a new investment he was
1838.08s: just sitting on billions of dollars a cow but I was just waiting to see what was next and what he saw
1843.84s: was GameStop being shorted you know we could save and you know criminally right like just
1851.04s: excessively shorted and he saw that the board was just completely incompetent with the way that
1856.72s: they were running the company they were overloaded and that there was a $400 million bond to come
1861.20s: and do in March of 2021 and they had no plan to pay it and they had like less than 50 million
1866.80s: than liquid cash and so he said look all this takes is for someone to come in refocus the business
1872.72s: on what it used to do best and you know we can turn on this franchise around and he's been you know
1880.32s: even despite the fact that a lot of people on Twitter get angry at at how slow the progress has been
1884.72s: he has been successful in you know making this thing profitable on a net basis and reducing
1890.80s: overall expenses and so and it's not easy because running a company like GameStop a legacy brick
1896.40s: and mortar business in a e-commerce world is is difficult so you got to give him kudos for that
1903.12s: and I think that you know if he if he is if he is genuinely getting interested in a co-op or
1911.04s: curative some form it's going to be on the same with the same philosophy of customers first
1918.08s: right he had a tweet that went viral that was you know protect women and children and I think at
1923.52s: all or pets and children at all costs right and that's kind of his philosophy and so he views
1929.52s: Amazon as this predatory firm that's just destroyed the American you know retail segment and effectively
1939.04s: gutted the American consumer because now they have fewer options it's just buy from Amazon or
1946.08s: don't or or nowhere because there's no other options and you know I think that that that relates to
1953.04s: his overall strategy so I I think we're still in this limbo of waiting to see what he does with
1958.32s: the cash because it's a huge amount of cash and he could do multiple things right he could literally
1962.32s: buy multiple businesses and entire companies with this amount of cash so we're still waiting and
1968.08s: and but I think that we're I think that things are happening in the background that there's not
1974.56s: able to allow us to be privy to yeah now one of the big elements I've
1983.04s: curious from specifically evaluation perspective from really both you guys again is turning around
1991.20s: brick and mortar store keeping it at least on and profitable long enough to continue down the path
1996.40s: is difficult doable with difficult and one of the the big tailwinds that I've kind of seen is just
2006.24s: how supportive the game stock community is of game stock it's like next level there's not a lot
2014.00s: of people that feel the way about Amazon right like there's there's nobody from an investor standpoint
2021.20s: and from a communal standpoint that's so stoked about Amazon so what role do you think the community
2029.52s: plays in the future direction of game stock because it has been a massive thing that's kept things
2038.80s: afloat to a degree to where we are now so do you think that's part of the consideration that might
2045.68s: go into future business plans so taking it from the perspective of if you were RC how do you
2055.44s: integrate the game stock community into future plans do you at all or do you kind of just focus
2061.60s: on the business and hope that the community falls along I can I can I can talk about do you want to
2071.60s: chat yeah I don't want to take all the airtime but you know in corporate finance there's something
2077.60s: and and you know Kevin you might know about this but there's something called the dividend clientele
2082.80s: which is you know the study that whenever a company starts to issue dividends on a consistent
2088.64s: basis and if they're able to continually support that dividend a strong base of retail investors as
2095.04s: well institutional but but investors become toddlers for lack of a better term of their stock
2100.88s: and so if the company continues to promote dividends and to give dividends to the shareholders
2106.48s: these shareholders will come in and they'll buy through bull and bear markets through cycles through
2112.64s: economic catastrophe through what have you because they believe that they can get continual benefits from
2118.56s: from holding the stock right in the form of these dividends and that creates these very strong
2123.12s: hands that are much more hard to shake out of the market than than we can's right there's tons
2129.20s: of studies showing that for example companies with a with a dividend clientele have much less
2136.40s: much lower ratios of short interest and they also are much less much less often the targets of
2143.36s: short attacks because again it's just harder to shake when we have all these people that are holding
2148.32s: on to the company and holding on to these dividends harder for them to to be shaken off of holding
2153.44s: the stock and the same thing I'd say is true of of of games obviously like there's a very very huge
2162.40s: retail contingent of investors who have bought shares and they're essentially never never selling
2168.32s: which is why you kind of see these price cycles move them way they do you see spikes in price from
2174.88s: a gamma or even like a mini short squeeze then we see a retracement and it comes back down to
2180.40s: to a hard level where it just will not go below you know whether that's $20 post split now in 2024
2188.08s: whether that was you know $4 free split in 2020 like there are these levels where it's like
2194.88s: there's just this hard wall of buyers that cannot be exhausted and so that's why big that's why
2201.20s: I'm sorry GME is for example so hard to chart is because like it just doesn't act like a normal stock
2207.36s: but those you know that retail investor segment buy a lot of measures and again it's hard to actually
2212.48s: get the exact number but by a lot of measures is probably the largest as a percent of the companies
2218.56s: float of any company in history so it is you according to your status yeah yeah it's there's
2227.12s: yeah absolutely so I was just saying that because I was like maybe there's some company out there
2232.16s: that I don't know about that's fucking you know sorry sorry it is the highest above a billion dollar
2236.96s: market cap because there was a couple that tried to do it on extremely micro's to try and prove
2243.68s: crime but as far as a billion dollar company or profitable company they are the highest percentage
2250.48s: of float that are direct registered in individual investor names yeah and that's around what 25
2257.76s: percent or so yeah and the one exception right is like global links with Robert Simpson 2005
2263.92s: where he bought like 100 limp percent the flow and dres did but that was yeah that was a sub like
2269.04s: 30 million market cap company but yeah for the majority of you know of companies they've never
2276.24s: seen an effect like this and so the retail segments all probably over you know 800,000 holders
2283.52s: across multiple nations and they're all supporting it not only by buying the stock and holding it
2287.84s: but by actively going out and buying items like game stock like there's giveaways there's tons of
2293.68s: people on Twitter I know Hachi does does giveaways of gift cards I think you've done that to Kevin
2300.24s: charity events yep yep there's people who give away the playing cards and basically they
2305.44s: that means they go and they buy like a thousand dollars worth of it and then give it away on Twitter
2309.52s: or fund razor and yeah there's just there's a level of support here that has never been seen
2317.12s: before in corporate finance like ever it's there'd be history books written about this for sure
2323.92s: what do you have there's things I found speaking of support is I part of what I started doing I
2332.40s: got to move the chat out of the way so I can share part of my screen is the community actually
2338.96s: introduced me to this document I don't know if you guys can see but it's it's called the diamond
2347.84s: handbook and it's a pretty comprehensive list of gme theories and we've been going through
2357.92s: literally every single one of them and I think we're close to a little over halfway through like
2364.00s: we're in like over page 400 or so one of the common themes that I've come across as I've been
2370.16s: prusing through all this documentation looking up the source documents and whatnot is this is
2376.80s: become a massive interest of mine because GameStop has become the vector through the ape community
2384.96s: that has identified a lot of underlying stuff that looks really interesting from a regulatory
2395.20s: standpoint and what I mean by that is you could probably read in between the lines is it looks
2400.72s: like there's a lot of fuckery going on everything from DTCC down to fin refines and stuff like that
2407.84s: so I wanted to ask you both your perspectives of the roles of these larger financial institutions
2419.92s: around something like GameStop specifically people that how they get involved and what their
2426.88s: motivations might be for how they get involved Eric you pointed out absolutely perfectly and I said
2437.20s: this on almost everyone on this face calls I've ever done the best thing from the January GameStop
2445.68s: saga sneeze in my opinion is that there's more than a million people now that looked that looked
2454.96s: corruption and data every single day against the people at the top and post it instantly to multiple
2464.72s: social media sites but millions that have gotten screwed between OG AMC when it was in the basket
2475.76s: and then TLP that bad there's so many people that are just trying to that probably created some of
2483.60s: those docs that you have in there highlighted that before January 21 might not have ever invested
2492.32s: before or had an index fund or something and so the best thing that came from that is that many
2498.48s: people try and expose crime every single day like they they all thought at the top that retail would
2506.32s: go away and forget about it and they didn't like all these people are in different communities doing
2513.04s: this famous acting every single day as they were 40 months ago and they can't hide like eventually
2521.92s: they have to file things and there's people way smarter than me programming and algos for notifications
2529.76s: that are getting these finnera and scc fileings loaded instantly to the computer and posting them
2535.20s: across the entire world about what's happening and I think that is the absolutely cool thing
2543.12s: yeah it's like the biggest like crowd you know almost like a crowdfunded financial research community
2550.56s: in history like they're literally has never been anything like that and again I was on you know
2557.12s: the Reddit boards in January of 2021 and again I used to work at a private equity fintech firm and
2562.48s: there were people that were you know active traders at my company that we're looking at it there
2567.52s: were people that were options traders commodity traders I met people through this community who are
2573.12s: mathematicians wealth managers right portfolio managers bankers there's old man repo who's a
2581.44s: former manager of a repo desk at a big bank like there's all these people that have just come out
2587.84s: of the woodwork and done research and started saying like you know what is actually going on because
2592.56s: the game stop phenomenon is so like puzzling to the financial establishment because it just
2598.40s: bucks every single traditional trend right we saw the beginning of this squeeze play out in
2604.56s: January and you know people were in the lead up to to like the zenith right there people were
2612.08s: starting to get you know more and more agitated with the amount of propaganda from the media saying
2617.36s: that the squeeze was over that you should go home don't buy the stock you don't need to own it
2622.64s: and then with the Robin Hood shutting off the buy button as well as 182 retail brokers
2627.76s: there was just a mass outrage at at the system and so people that started putting out the meme right
2635.04s: like they turn off the buy button we turn off the cell button like I don't care about money anymore
2639.92s: I just want to hold this stock and and show the system that this is not okay and so that's become
2646.16s: almost like the calling card of the community right we're we're not only you know looking for
2652.00s: for wealth and for capital gains we want to see real change in the financial system of the way
2656.16s: that things are structured now because it's clearly unsustainable there's so many companies that
2660.16s: get naked-chorded so many companies that that suffer from FTDs and you know we've seen through the
2666.08s: saga we've seen the proliferation of like education at every level of finance so you know there were
2672.24s: people looking into FTD cycles and how the continuous net settlement system works that are people
2678.08s: looking into the ETFs like you know we found that I mean just in what June of those year I did a
2684.88s: DD on the ETFs and one of the biggest ETFs that holds GMME which is XRT which is the spider
2691.12s: retail ETF has been on the SEC threshold list for shorting for like 1400 days and so how can an
2700.56s: ETF be on the threshold list for 1400 days and nobody investigates what's going on and so like
2706.40s: that these kinds of questions started to get raised and for the first time right there's a massive
2711.28s: retail push to to get change across and we pressured Gary Gensler we pressured other SEC
2717.04s: officials to change and I think there's like been more education than anything that we could have
2724.64s: ever dreamed about that has that has proliferated across you know the globe basically.
2733.60s: Literally cannot second that more it's been one of the funnest parts for me it's like I said I've
2738.96s: been training for a long time but I have learned so much about market structure micro structure
2746.56s: and relationships through GameStop that literally never would have crossed my mind previously because
2752.08s: my job is to look at options throw some numbers around and essentially make a guess and so I normally
2758.96s: just do that and as I started looking at a lot of the GameStop stuff and what they're pointing out
2764.08s: it's like wait a minute like there's there's actually some really interesting things going on here
2767.92s: that do not seem to make sense to me or they do not seem to be fully up aboard which leads me to
2774.48s: a natural follow on question because you mentioned some of the the short side and actors from
2781.20s: that perspective do you guys think that there are still legacy shorts open from the original
2789.12s: squeeze that have just been moved into different financial instruments and perpetuated or do you
2795.92s: think that those have been satisfied now and it might be a new group of shorts?
2801.12s: No absolutely absolutely I think there's still shorts stuck here I mean if you read and again like
2806.96s: this might sound for a lot of people like a you know forechand conspiracy theory but you read the
2812.96s: House Financial Services Committee own report on GameStop it's like 182 pages I read the whole
2818.72s: thing and you know what they say in their own words they say according to our analysis of internal
2824.88s: SEC data this was not a short squeeze shorts never shorts were never the majority volume in this
2830.16s: in this in this squeeze it was just retail buying and gamma hedging that was it like 2021 was not
2836.56s: the end that 120 140 percent some brokers you know Finder at one point was printing 260 percent
2843.52s: Ian Carroll sent me one at 313 percent short interest right none of that was fully closed by the
2850.64s: by the House Financial Services Committee own report and so if they weren't able to close in 2021
2856.88s: like how are they able to close now without causing causing the the prices spike and so we you know
2862.16s: we've we've tracked them using swaps and derivatives and other instruments to just move their
2867.44s: obligations forward and just try to kick the can continually and you know archa goes was also an
2872.96s: example of that right like GME was name dropped in the archa goes lawsuit when they collapsed and
2878.96s: there's also evidence you know tangential evidence from archa goes is excess capital premium charges
2884.96s: which are the charges that are are assigned to them by the nscc is like basically their liability
2891.44s: for their stock portfolio and you see like their excess capital premium spikes and forms the exact
2898.40s: pattern of GME in late January and early february of 2021 and they blew up in March of 2021
2905.36s: and so like the evidence is there that it it wasn't just right uh tin foil comes
2912.32s: through to the truth that these shorts and clothes and that they use derivatives and swaps or
2915.84s: total return swaps to to try to hedge exposure they were actually doing this um now the question is
2922.08s: how many other short short author they're still open we don't know and it's going to be really hard
2926.48s: to know because again and i think Kevin can expand more on this right they've changed how they
2930.32s: calculate short interests so that they can't go above 100% ever again so the formulas have been changed
2936.40s: yeah and i also think you you highlight another thing say i spent a while because again
2940.88s: derivatives is kind of like what i do it's like the only thing i know anything about and the the
2946.88s: tricky part with something like swaps is there you can get details on them but a lot of more black
2952.08s: boxes you understand in the specific terms of them are are difficult now it that leads to a
2958.72s: follow-on question though which is with some of the um at the markets and new shares being offered
2967.52s: shorts would have been given several opportunities to finally take an exit at not blow-up levels
2975.60s: still uncomfortable still they're gonna eat the launch but um not necessarily go through
2981.12s: implosion so then why maintain the cost of carrying the shorts is it you think they're approaching it
2989.84s: from the this is in eventuality where this thing is gonna roll over and go out of business and if so
2998.16s: most of them are going to be using Bayesian models which as a company starts to acquire several
3003.60s: billion dollars in free cash the probability of that business going out of business in the near
3010.72s: term starts to become less likely so then do you think that might influence their future decision
3018.24s: to continue maintaining the shorts or not can't have and do you want to answer that or i can tackle
3024.40s: it too yeah i got it let's go that was a serious question there uh well good i have nothing prepared
3034.32s: so i'm just going off the dome i'm hoping this stuff isn't terrible no no it was amazing
3039.92s: i i'm just trying to remember the points from it so when it comes to shorts and clothes for
3046.48s: the input it perfectly they even said it thanks then i do believe there's a massive position
3056.88s: in archaic goes bag because everyone that touches it goes bankrupt and someone's holding
3064.96s: that and i posted about it yesterday but i haven't found any answers i haven't been on ex yet today
3070.32s: but i posted the the reports posted him out on friday for ubs or what they're holding in their bag
3076.96s: from credit suisse and then someone in the comments said that they put it
3083.20s: so what's really said there's going to be archive for 50 years before it gets released and so
3088.48s: i have not deep dive that i'm sure prove it's not going to be able to sleep because of that comment
3094.40s: and trying to figure out which one of those two before tomorrow morning that would be epic if it comes
3099.28s: out finally but i think the position got too big on the basket to close for the market maker swaps
3110.00s: financial instruments or as hedge funds go they could have closed at any time because
3116.80s: like you said the at the money offerings but that's the worst time because retail is hitting by
3124.00s: almost ungodly high volume when those offerings have come out but market makers proved in may
3132.64s: when 500 million shares traded and we know it wasn't like people selling that they can get out at any
3146.88s: time as far as small shorts like if they were shorted you know 100 million a hedge fund on a
3154.08s: market maker or someone with tens of billions of dollars of security sold not yet purchased but they
3160.64s: have a liquidity last four years during the run ups and the cycles and the hype and roaring kitty
3167.12s: and all these to get out of it they didn't they were going to cause buying fresh right that retail
3171.92s: was already doing that and by the time we see Friday's market close it's back down to max paying
3176.88s: and everyone got screwed because it went up 50% drop 40% within a week so they can they could have
3183.92s: gotten out as far as a hedge fund goes I want everyone watching to also separate a hedge fund just
3191.92s: like a small office or you know even a big office billion a couple billion assets first market
3198.32s: makers with trillions of dollars of orders that come through every single day that they are allowed
3203.44s: to legally counterfeit shares and go try and find them and if they can't they put them into different
3210.32s: derivatives trade between each other all these other things and so I do believe they could have
3216.16s: gotten out of it liquidity was there based on market makers except exception to create liquidity
3225.68s: for everyone during those cycles on the bid and ask there's no way 50 mil or 500 million shares sold
3233.84s: in May from retail investors right synthetic they were going to have to be delivered and then we
3241.44s: saw the June run up right after it again. What do you guys think the current positioning is then
3249.52s: for start maybe market maker side of things and then hedge fund high frequency whatever you want
3257.92s: to buck into that institutional component do you guys think that if you were to divvy up the current
3263.28s: shorts that may or may not be out there where do you think they live as a percentage wise between
3267.84s: the entities. I mean it's so this is where it's hard to parse it out right because again some of
3275.20s: the swap data shows you know wildly different different figures but you know we looked at in 2021
3282.72s: obviously there was the infamous Brazilian puts which were actually found by Lawson was a finance
3290.24s: professor very smart guy at a Bloomberg terminal he found this subsidiary of of credit suisse in
3297.28s: Brazil that held 80% of the float of GameStop in deep into money calls as well as puts or out of
3306.00s: the money puts and so the question is like why does this credit suisse subsidiary have 80% of the float
3312.32s: in like call options basically like what what are they doing and when he reached out and asked them
3318.32s: what's what was going on a day later the data was erased from the Bloomberg terminal and the support
3324.88s: team told him oh that was a data error that you should never see that again don't worry about it and
3329.52s: he's like whoa whoa whoa he's like he's never seen that before right that there's a data error
3334.80s: going on of this but that was 80% of the float with a single entity and now credit suisse was a
3341.20s: prime broker prime broker for like dozens and dozens of hedge funds right that were short GameStop
3346.40s: archigos being one of them there's also a smaller hedge fund that was following along archigos
3351.36s: as footsteps I don't have their name confirmed yet but Dario who's another banker and finance guy
3358.64s: who's right on Twitter he he shared with me in our podcast that we did last June that there was
3365.12s: a couple other hedge funds that he knows personally have were were in on the GameStop trade and
3369.52s: that we're trying to use swaps to get out of the short obligations and so if if one prime broker
3376.40s: which may even be the largest prime broker that was facilitating shorts against GameStop or swaps
3381.44s: against GameStop if they were 8% of the float then what were the others I mean had probably
3386.64s: around 120 140% at least and the swaps that we saw rolling over this summer that were
3392.64s: contributing to the price action were also around I mean some of these were massive they were like
3398.16s: in terms of share count some of them were 20% of the float in a single swap rolling over over the
3403.44s: course of a week and that was just from the data that we could scrape together from like the CFTC
3409.52s: and so if you know it's hard to give you a hard number on like how many shorts are still out there
3415.68s: but I would say well over 100% of the float is probably still short and prove it.
3420.48s: Of the entities that have shorted though like splitting between market makers and hedge bonds
3427.44s: other kinds of shops out institutions do you think most of the short float whatever the total
3434.00s: number is most of that is with the market making side of things do you think that it's within the
3439.92s: hedge fund side of things or do you think it's 50 50 split the reason why I asked the question is
3444.32s: because the impact of the market and the way things would move would vary quite a bit based on which
3450.32s: of those conditions it might be so that's the premise. I think it's mostly moved to the
3457.20s: derivative side of the hedge fund book personally I mean the market makers right they're much more
3461.92s: agile and they also have many more loopholes to work with in terms of kicking the can down the road
3466.56s: and so they don't even have to really use swaps in the same way that like a hedge fund or a private
3472.64s: family office would have to have to do they can use just the market maker exemption and continually
3478.64s: kick the can and so it's much easier like you said it's much easier for you know structurally for
3485.44s: a market maker to avoid actually making good on the promises in the form of stock loans
3491.76s: for long periods of time and so I think that market makers have largely probably cleared out their
3496.24s: excessive obligations and it just rests on the swap side for hedge funds and banks.
3503.04s: Who's thinking Kevin your thoughts?
3507.20s: Proving do you think the swap rollover at the end of spring the May June swap rollover
3518.40s: caused the price action so you've seen every quadwitching and swap rollover for four years right
3525.52s: and how many came true with a big bump up zero would you not contribute that to Roinkitty at the time
3531.28s: I would obviously for May right and then June would have been my presumption sorry catch you off
3538.32s: would be the tip of 35 on other firms and kind of just entire week of ro to air two months
3546.32s: of him tweeting stuff compared to that swap finally causing something because how many had it?
3557.28s: Yeah yeah that's that's that's accurate but if you look at Richard Newton's some of his work
3562.96s: like he's tracked it back to 2020 2021 and you know again it's it's kind of like it's kind of like
3568.96s: what you say like some of the swaps rollover and they're they're they're large and then the price
3575.04s: barely moves up a few percent or flat and then other times there's a swap rollover and the price
3580.88s: goes absolutely ballistic and so my theory is that you know May and June were particularly large
3587.68s: swap rollovers as well as actually November and December that we have we didn't swap rollover
3594.64s: who would be looking to tweet when they saw the swap extra big yeah Roinkitty and so
3601.60s: and this would also kind of answer right if he understands the swap cycles this well and like
3607.20s: their their obligation cycles and when they actually have to hedge like you this under this could
3612.48s: explain why he came back with what was it like triple or quadruple the amount of cash that he left
3618.40s: with in 2021 because he disappeared in 2021 with like you know what was it was it 80,000 shares or
3625.92s: 800 that was 800,000 shares I think and it came back with five million something like that post
3632.08s: and so it's like he five X more than five X his position and everyone was like wait like
3638.16s: Roinkitty has a quarter of a million dollars or billion dollars like he has 200 million like what
3645.44s: how did he grow like he's now the size of a of a private family office or hedge fund like a mid size
3651.92s: one like he's starting to get out there and so yeah I don't think it's unresumable to to expect that
3660.32s: he understood this and you know there there is some evidence right like if you look at the swap
3664.48s: cycles there were much more consistent in 2021 than they were in 2022 and 2023.
3671.60s: 2024 we had swap rollovers rollovers in March and April that were small to mid size that didn't
3677.84s: have any impact on price and then we had we actually did have a big really big one at the end of
3683.52s: May and then a really big one in early June and Roinkitty's tweets were exactly timed with the
3688.16s: expiration of those swaps and I don't know if you know finance lot on twitter but finance lot was
3694.72s: another guy he was like a trend follower and chart analyst and financial analyst and he took I
3701.52s: asked me for the FDD and the swap dad and I sent it to him and after looking at it for like a day
3706.56s: he said Roinkitty's next tweet is going to be June 3rd and he's like right before he's like he's
3712.00s: like if you look at the pattern that's what he's going to do and I thought at the time I was like no
3715.84s: I'm like I think he finished tweeting in May the price went back down I still hold onto my I bought
3720.32s: some more shares but I'm like just just chilling here and then you know what came to fast June 3rd
3726.24s: he starts tweeting again and then the price subtracting again and so I think again I think he probably
3731.68s: is playing the cycles and he knows about them and they're probably exacerbating his moves but I
3735.44s: absolutely I think that he he's having an impact on price obviously I mean there's probably
3740.96s: alga goes out there that are smashed by bitcoin every time he tweets because they're just trying
3745.76s: to front run retail liquidity we saw two weeks ago yeah yeah on the airplane definitely a million
3752.80s: share purchase within seconds yep of his tweet and that's why he tweeted at him too I was like
3760.40s: aren't you just do this like late on a Friday as well it's not market manipulation to tweet a
3765.92s: picture of a high five or something or just say hi and then to lee instantly the alga is
3772.08s: going to buy a million shares and the options are going to go from a penny to a dollar within seconds
3778.72s: with absolutely no market manipulation you didn't buy those shares someone else did on it
3786.00s: and then he decided to ignore me and then do the same exactly on Monday morning after that with
3790.40s: the 109 and 420 tweet that he had was three days later I was like yeah
3799.28s: cycle theory so fascinating to me because I've done a ton of research and trying to
3805.76s: regress it to see if I can identify an actual trigger based on the swaps and I think one of the
3812.96s: issues with it for it having any efficacy is that we we don't know how they settle and we don't
3819.84s: know what the requirement is, comes settlement because they can always just make a new one
3827.28s: and they can change the contents of it so the we one of the series that we did actually on the
3834.40s: live streams that we typically do on Saturday which is GameStop specific is we we literally went
3839.04s: through every single one of roaring kiddies yolo tweets and I made an entire tracker for every
3847.28s: single trade he put on what the account value was changes in account value and what the positions
3853.36s: that he put on to get a sense of his trading style because I was actually really surprised
3859.44s: that when I went all the way to the beginning that he started with all options which was very
3865.76s: surprising to me because from the communities I don't know from like the the sense I get from a
3871.68s: lot of the community seems like options were like a bad thing like you weren't supposed to talk
3876.24s: about them they were telling me and stuff like that which was interesting so have you guys done
3882.56s: specific research on not just the swaps that we think might have led to price movement but just
3890.72s: swaps impact broadly across all of them and the reason I ask it is just because one of the things I
3896.72s: noticed when I look at the GameStop community is people do tend to have a bit of a confirmation
3903.60s: data mining where we have something that we want to see is true and we go looking for that
3908.72s: and I have a stats background so a big part of what we typically would do is look for the other
3914.64s: side right like a broad analysis and I'm so fascinated by the broader research around swaps
3922.00s: because of how nebulous they are so to summarize that really long thought into a succinct question
3927.52s: I'm wondering if you guys have done like specific research on the swaps as an entire group
3932.00s: to see market impact and if so are there specific trends that we found like certain
3937.76s: exploration swaps or certain entities in the swaps or anything like that?
3942.96s: So that's a really good question I really love the caveats you give there because I don't know
3947.36s: if you watched my swap videos on GameStop I did back in June but I said the exact same thing I was
3953.76s: like look guys I would love it if they if I could perfectly predict GameStop's price movement
3959.12s: from these swaps but the caveat that I gave obviously was the problem with these instruments is
3963.92s: that because of the opacity of the counterparties we don't know how much is hedged and so if you
3969.20s: have a total return swap where you have a prime broker and a hedge fund and the hedge fund says I
3974.40s: want to get exposure I want to get synthetic exposure you know short exposure to GameStop but I
3979.20s: don't want to actively go out and short the shares can you do that for me and then I'll you know
3983.84s: set up this swap where I'll pay you a fixed interest rate above prime and give up these other
3989.12s: socks as collateral and then you can basically give me exposure and pay me anytime GameStop you know
3994.16s: collapses the prime broker could either hedge their position 100% they could hedge their position
4001.76s: 50% they could hedge their position 0% like no one no one knows and so because that data is not
4007.92s: available the problem with these swaps is that some of the swaps can be huge we're talking billions
4013.36s: of dollars they can come up and if they were fully hedged on expiry or if they get rolled over
4019.20s: they just roll over and then nothing happens to the price because the the prime broker right the
4024.40s: the hedging entity in this case never actually has to go out and buy the shares to you know cover
4029.36s: a liability because a they they already have them or be they can just roll it over and so when we
4035.76s: look at when we look at the like the actual swapped data it's it's very important to be mindful
4042.56s: that you know as much as you want to be like so hit the hope you and pipe and say hey this is
4047.92s: this is an absolute guarantee of where the price will go in the next you know two one month two
4053.36s: month three months here's the times when it will spike buy options right before sell at the top
4058.96s: then buy puts let let the short short it back down and then you'll just profit if I had that money
4063.36s: making machine I wouldn't be here talking to you guys unfortunately I'd probably be on a beach
4067.76s: into heady uh sitting around with millions of dollars and so um yeah they're not like these cycles
4074.48s: are not uh they're not predictive enough to actually make make movements on now what is really
4081.04s: interesting about the swaps is there there's a couple things so first is that almost all the swaps
4086.96s: are not pure uh what you call like a pure total return swap which is where they're based on a
4092.80s: single security they're almost always portfolio swaps or basket swaps so what the entity is doing
4099.92s: is they're not just short in game stop they're shorting a basket of stocks and then they're also
4104.08s: hedging it with longs that are another basket of different stocks and this is exactly what Bill
4108.64s: Hoang did so if you use him as an example right he created total yeah he created total return swaps
4115.92s: which were basket swaps which were long viacom paramount and then a bunch of Chinese stocks
4121.92s: and then he was short game stop AMC and a bunch of retailers that he thought were going to go down
4127.20s: in 2020 you know 2019 2020 and 2021 and so the problem that he ran into and why he got like
4134.96s: his capital got just absolutely destroyed so quickly like he lost I think what eight billion
4139.28s: dollars in a single day is because not only did his shorts uh in his swap his swap move against him
4147.20s: longs also did so viacom paramount all those stocks had entered bubble territory in you know
4152.88s: February of 2021 and they all started correcting hard and he got margin cold on both ends of the swap
4158.88s: and he could not obviously uh cough up the collateral because he leveraged his firm something like eight
4164.24s: or nine to one on on the base equity and so you know he was just blowing up and then now there's
4171.04s: this huge toxic bag of of liabilities that the banks have right all these shorts on companies
4178.00s: that were that are are racing higher like gm e i don't know exactly the is his short position
4184.00s: amount but given on the excess capital premium right he probably entered around $10 $20 and the price
4190.24s: was $300 in 2021 and so he was deeply short on his gm e shorts are deeply underwater and then his
4197.36s: viacom and paramount stocks were were down like 30% in the space of two months and so he was just
4203.12s: obliterated now these banks are holding these liabilities and they have to figure out what to do
4208.16s: so um yeah it's been a long story short like what's interesting I haven't done a deep deep dive on
4213.28s: the you know like analyzing oh is our total return swaps better at you know maybe slightly better
4219.36s: predicting price you know do they have a point to correlation with price and the uh or folio
4225.28s: swaps have a point one correlation with price like is there any relationship there I haven't gone
4229.44s: that deep into the data yet but I do know that from my look of it there's it was never a single
4236.48s: a single gm e swap that was just pure gm e it was always basket or total return um or total
4242.24s: portfolio swaps um and they almost always had the long end of the swap uh either denominated
4249.12s: usd or euros and they were also holding you know large cap us stock as as like collateral so it
4255.60s: was like when I looked at it it was apple microsoft tesla things like that like things and in video
4262.72s: to like things that they expected to continually go up do you do you have like a reliable source for
4270.08s: as comprehensive of a data set of the swaps because I only have pieces of it and I haven't found
4277.12s: something that I fully trust but if either of you do I literally is weird as this is to say verbally
4284.00s: I would love to do the analysis on it because like I love looking at this stuff I just haven't found
4289.84s: like a solid data source yet that like I fully trust that it's comprehensive enough to be able to
4294.56s: walk away with conclusions sure I mean I have like here I can even let me pull it up I still have the
4301.68s: old gm emmaster archive as well as that would be super helpful and then in the meantime for
4307.84s: for those hanging out in the chat first thanks for coming in taking it with us talking about
4312.24s: game stop a little bit a big reason why I think game stop is super cool is because it connects people
4318.16s: from lots of different backgrounds right like even the the group that we have here and for me
4323.92s: I will always be a trader and a big part of what I try to do is objectively analyze things so
4329.84s: that's actually what I hope to do with with some of the swaps is to to be able to just literally
4335.28s: regress it and then see what what actually shows because my guess is that there might be so I don't
4341.52s: think swaps writ large I haven't found really predictive qualities around that yet but one of my
4348.56s: further guess is that some of the sub qualities of the swaps might be predictive but I don't have a
4355.12s: large enough data set that I trust enough yet yeah absolutely I mean I've I've gotten was it
4362.00s: Linux and then what's the name of the other there's another guy on Twitter who was able to script
4369.84s: the data for me and send it to me yeah I can hit you up and see see what we can get and then
4376.32s: for those in the chat if there's anything in particular that you want to ask any of the dudes
4380.64s: you could start throwing them in now we probably have like maybe 10 15 minutes or so I don't want to
4384.32s: take too much of these guys this time but as always I'm stoked to chat with you guys well you guys
4390.00s: can I can I can show you if you want to look at the swap data right now I can I can share the screen
4395.44s: yeah we'd love to sure so let me make sure I'm sharing the right screen just a second oh no let
4402.80s: us see the other screen let us see the screen with all the ground lens yeah you'd I want to know
4408.48s: what your sources are I want to know yeah let's get through that search history yeah well now I
4416.24s: might my search is pretty boring but yeah so for us three you want to you want to learn about
4425.28s: you know the history of central banking and you know all the yeah how to monetize a YouTube
4431.76s: channel that's those my two main searches and how far back does this go so okay so like this one
4439.04s: goes back to 2020 I believe 2022 it looks like I see 19 in my let me what's concave we don't
4450.08s: spend too much time on this because I can parse through this execution execution time stamp so
4455.44s: when the swap was actually executed yeah okay yeah but again like this is initiator closed when
4462.00s: you mean executed yeah executed means initiated I believe yeah yeah because so some of these
4468.08s: are so interesting is like some of these will show like I actually was able to dig through the data
4473.12s: and for some reason my other excel file where actually like broke this all down all got corrupted so
4479.12s: I like I had this all organized to make it look really good and so you could understand it but
4484.96s: in June but when I reopened it was like gone and so I was like oh shit so this is like the original
4489.84s: file but so what you can see with some of these like what's really interesting is some of these
4496.00s: will be callbacks and again you'd have like scroll all the way through this to find which ones are
4501.20s: like that but some of these are like callbacks where you'll see like the execution time stamp you
4509.76s: know and the event time stamp be different so it'll be you know like a basically like the event
4516.64s: happens on you know let's say like January of 2021 like January 5th and then you'll see basically
4524.32s: like a callback to another swap so it rolls over and says January 5th 2022 and says executed and
4529.68s: then and then some of these will lack a you know lack some of these time stamps so those ones are
4537.76s: sometimes the like if they're like increased or termination they're sometimes like mismatched because
4544.80s: you see that like they're basically being rolled over they're being canceled or they're being swapped
4548.72s: for something else but the data is hard to parse out because again it's been hard to find people
4554.88s: like okay these are examples where these are like corrected ones right so these are corrected swaps
4559.20s: so there's no event time stamp but there's an execution time stamp so you know that like these are
4563.84s: older swaps and the as you can see here I'll zoom in these are all basket right basket swaps
4571.44s: up here it was all oh oops that's too much up here it was all equity it was contract for difference
4578.64s: I believe yeah so look at that these are all contract for difference so C of Ds are kind of similar
4586.24s: to single stock swaps and that they're just like you basically get paid on the performance of
4592.24s: security and not you don't actually have exposure real exposure to the underlying but what's
4597.76s: hard about this right is I you know I've worked in finance but I've never seen data like this and
4603.20s: I've reached out to people on Twitter and there's no one that's willing to help me like understand
4607.60s: exactly what all these what all these things mean yeah but yeah I probably in the last guy to help
4614.24s: you understand what it means but what I can do is very easily identify relationships between these
4620.40s: things and movements which again I'm I'm the village idiot now it's like I'm trying to trade so
4627.68s: if I can find stuff that leads me to tradable ideas that that's how I prime my brain but at
4632.48s: honestly as I'm going through a joking aside I can probably parse through a bit of this so yeah
4638.00s: if you don't mind I'd love to get a copy of this from you and then I can start start running it
4643.04s: through what I have but I think we'll be able to at least understand yeah or nay just different
4649.68s: qualities of this and then subsequent impact because another thing is all of you know when analyzing
4654.96s: something like the stock market it's really difficult because it's multi-variant so even if there's
4658.64s: some sort of correlation between this coming up in some degree and then price movement there also
4665.60s: can be other stuff at least the price movement so what I do is I keep a track of like all key events
4670.80s: so then I can overlap like is there a news event that happened to come on that day as well so that
4674.80s: we can try to actually get to a decent the decent answer so yeah so through this yes so this is
4681.28s: exactly what I was talking about so you see the contract for differences are like those are like
4684.72s: the single entity swaps that are all this gm and the dot dot and stands for NYSE for North America
4691.92s: so it's like a denominator that shows like this is literally American gm east stock because there's
4696.00s: gm that trades in Europe or in other other countries but when we get down to the basket or portfolio
4702.00s: swaps you can see here like the long end of the this is the what's it called
4708.72s: I should prove you a new I'm like stands for a New York Stockings change what new stands for New
4715.44s: York Stockings change and and stands for NYSE yeah New York Stockings change that's that's what I was
4722.88s: told by someone who's who's traded you know derivatives before they're like oh yeah that's a
4728.24s: denominator that helps the it's like an internal back end thing to make sure that they know
4733.52s: it's that for NYSE not gm on another exchange we can see here like look you see the underlier
4739.92s: lake one AMC chipotle coin base I don't know what DT is I don't know what N is but five in
4750.08s: OQ gm or oh the N is the sorry that's obviously the gm e dot N proven we can't see what you're on
4756.72s: right now yeah you're on termination right now wait really yeah it's like a sharing part of your screen
4768.24s: wait let me try to be sure we could see the cursor now you see the cursor going but whatever screen
4773.84s: you're on that's why I was asking about the new because you were on new when he said new
4778.08s: there you go can you see this now yeah you see it okay yeah put it up put it on a letter on a letter
4784.88s: are you on the right side of an end no I'm just making sure your cursor is in the right spot
4789.68s: yeah so you're gm e dot N yeah so these are so yeah for a large part of the spreadsheet these are
4796.00s: these contract for differences which are these like again similar to a single swap a single equity
4803.84s: but when we get to the portfolio swaps or the basket swaps you can see here so it's AMC dot N so that's
4809.76s: AMC us chipotle right coin base dot OQ DT I don't know what DT is I don't know what stock F is
4817.28s: is that forward yeah forward five in I don't know that one and then you see gm e here again and then
4823.44s: you see grab and so a lot of these swaps will have like again you'll see like massive chunks of them
4830.24s: that are just the same you know it's like the same basket of five or eight stocks that they're
4836.72s: shorting or that they're long or whatever and here's another one same same thing just slightly
4842.48s: different order yeah you just see like the same thing over and over again oh here's one with a gm e
4848.48s: and robin hood and I don't know what grab is if you guys know what that is or five in but yeah
4855.52s: whoever this is they're shorting obviously a basket of of entire stocks and then some of them will
4861.28s: have a long leg of the like it's a portfolio swap that's structured in a way where they will actually
4866.00s: have a long and a short end of the swap and then you'll see their longs and again what I've seen
4870.48s: historically that the longs are like Nvidia Tesla Apple Microsoft it's like the big the big name
4877.44s: blue chip tech stocks and from this just said a curiosity how do we know that there's a long and short
4884.24s: or are we just coming up with a reasonable assumption based off of what we can see here it's just a
4890.16s: basket yeah it's that's what I thought I just wanted to make sure as I'm going through this
4895.12s: it's because yeah underlier leg one is is usually the you know the collateral that they're requesting
4901.68s: right it's like that's the the first leg of the swap is what they want to receive shares of
4906.32s: this and so the assumption is the entity who is originating this swap who is asking for the swap
4910.88s: to be created is short these companies and they're asking for a stream of you know it would be
4915.36s: select synthetic exposure to these shares and so because this is the first leg that's all in the
4921.60s: broader point I just I was certifying the difference between like knowing like we know and
4926.64s: improve versus we're making a a reasonable assumption which it sounds like we're just making an
4931.44s: assumption which is a reasonable assumption yeah yeah cool yeah all right awesome let me yeah I would
4937.84s: love to grab a copy of that though that would be absolutely sick I can send it over sure yeah cool
4942.32s: and then I want to go on in the comments just say hey Zeus said is this like CDOs yeah it's exactly
4951.92s: like that at the end of the big short where nobody can figure out what the hell is going on is a
4957.28s: hundred times bigger than you think yes and Aaron said earlier with the data and everything you'll
4963.84s: never see all of it you'll never you can't tell at the end what was closed or rolled for a few
4972.32s: months as far as like ins and data because you doesn't take that long and you can report tens of
4979.68s: billions of trades wrongly or not at all that just came out between 2013 and 21 for Citadel so
4988.48s: I just don't know all the data you just pay a few pennies yeah ten years ten years later yep so
4995.84s: yeah that's what data is like the ones that have to report it's kind of like hedge funds or
5002.16s: individual institute or individual investors that are shorting something when you see short
5007.12s: flow as far as what's reported just remember that every single top brokerage gets fine for
5013.44s: misreporting every single year what they don't do is on right and they're doing that for a reason on
5019.92s: certain exact equities yeah we mean and and there's a red at a bit's work but at a bit did like a
5031.36s: really good deep dive on like you know it was like Goldman Sachs Bank of America like you know
5038.64s: Jeffries like all these investment and commercial banks that have been miss marking you know
5044.88s: long sales or short sales as long they've been misallocating customer uh securities to cover
5051.12s: their own positions they've been misreporting short positions I mean it's it's literally like
5056.32s: once you start reading it and it's like you go through page and page and page and page and page
5060.48s: of lawsuit from the SEC and then they only get a few million dollar fine or 20 million dollar fine
5065.36s: and no one ever goes to jail you realize that this is it's in the end to the industry I mean
5070.08s: this is what they do professionally basically yeah I go ahead yeah I was just going to say I was
5078.24s: running through the comments here I was going to grab a couple of those if you guys are ready for a few
5081.20s: of those sure sweet um one of them is one that I've actually spent a while taking looking
5088.88s: taking a look at from Fosity and it says do you think kitty has methods to perfectly time his
5093.44s: trades that we haven't completely figured out or is he buying leaps and waiting and um all
5097.52s: I'm sure I'll start you guys can pile on whenever you want but um I look through I call it finger
5102.72s: printing you can come up with a way that different institutions entities tend to do business and like
5108.64s: I said we went through literally every single one of his trades and it's possible it is possible I
5117.04s: can't prove one way or the other but what I can say is there's nothing based on what we've seen
5123.60s: from what he's posted that would indicate that being the case because if somebody has the ability
5130.16s: to perfectly time stuff based on what he's posted his portfolio is gone through 60% drawdowns 80%
5137.44s: drawdowns then doubling in a half two days later like that's not a a function of perfect timing
5143.28s: he's held through periods where if he captured profit he would realize more money
5148.88s: than during the subsequent drop can buy in with even more that being said the natural question is
5154.40s: where does a quarter billion dollars come from and that's why I think it's reasonable to say
5159.28s: it's possible so the my thought on that question specifically is that we can't tell specifically
5167.12s: because nobody has a look inside his book I've not seen all of his trades so I couldn't tell you
5172.00s: but based on what I have seen from what he has posted it does not seem to be the case to me but I
5177.84s: don't know if you guys have an opinion on that one I don't think Rory and Kitty has to worry
5183.84s: about any cycles or anything anymore with his power of posting as far as I like that power of posting
5192.64s: like he's got the golden ticket with no market manipulation posting a picture of a time magazine
5202.72s: like everyone's like was commenting on my post about you know buying the 30-hour calls 10
5209.20s: seconds or 10 minutes before the market closed on a Friday like oh yeah I'm sure he wants to go to
5214.24s: jail and I'd be like try and prove market manipulation on that like it took five years to prove it
5221.28s: on Elon and make him pay a fine that he actually posted we have a buyout for this price that is
5228.32s: 100% market manipulation on a tweet like someone's gonna buy out a Tesla for more 20 to share
5236.08s: posting a picture of a cat and a stock goes up but if he didn't place any trades or if he bought
5242.72s: them a couple days before yeah there's nothing to that so his in my opinion his strategies changed
5252.88s: into one that's less frequent perfectly timed and is going off of just his holdings he'll post
5265.92s: his yellow when he's ready and then it will probably be after a month or more after he's placed
5276.00s: these trades with a random tweet but he doesn't want to be on the hook for you know buying everything
5282.32s: before a yellow post that'd be different than a random meme because he's shown his positions
5288.08s: so you know going through his post for the last couple of years he was onto the cycles onto
5296.32s: the short interest and everything early but in my opinion now it's just going off of his power
5304.40s: and the other thing too right is like even if he is saying hey I really like GameStop you know I
5313.04s: think it's an attractive investment or something like that that's not illegal right I mean Jim
5318.88s: Kramer goes on TV every school day and says apples a buy and he has like a giant butt buzzes
5326.24s: by and he smashes and he says go buy Apple if you're you know if you're smart if you know it's good
5331.92s: for you or sell micro strategies or Bitcoin sell it sell it sell it and there's never any
5338.32s: investigation onto you know what his actual portfolio moves are he found a loophole with his charitable
5345.44s: fund exactly that's the day I started my charity was that I might actually be able to give I mean I
5352.16s: had this goal forever of getting personal finance into schools as ridiculous we learned how to
5357.36s: line dance and play the recorder instead of learning about money it's all part of the plan yeah
5362.40s: but I started like I hit the button to go file for a charity because once the fund grew big enough
5370.48s: I could post positions that the charity could go into or not and it's not going to be from myself
5378.72s: or financial advice or from my firm has a fiduciary but it's going to be for charity what we think is
5386.32s: best for that fund and what positions we go into or get out of I was just going to mere
5393.28s: creamer but do the right thing instead of read off the teleprompter.
5401.36s: Started to see too like the the edham flow of that like what it actually materializes into why not
5406.72s: that's fun like over yeah it's sick I have one more question from the chat that I think will be
5412.48s: fun for us to end on it's very thematic this one's from yesterday in gaming it could be today in
5418.96s: gaming but it's specifically yesterday in gaming by the way what exactly would it take for the
5426.40s: shorts to finally be forced to close what's the checkmate how is closure achieved emotional
5434.32s: and financial now one quick caveat obviously something like emotional closure is one in the
5441.52s: entirely that's up to the person's side never be exactly you probably never know what we just
5446.64s: got but from a structural question on what eventually short causes the shorts to close I think
5453.92s: that's a great question so what do you guys think so yeah do I mean did it go ahead so I've been
5460.96s: you know I've been banging the the drum on Twitter for this for a while but look I think there are
5467.92s: two things or I'd maybe say three-manager catalyst for closure right one is the actual bankruptcy of
5474.88s: of these funds and the force you know float like basically a force wind down of of these entities
5480.80s: that have been short game stop and the liquidation of their assets and the closing of their liabilities
5484.80s: which would be closing the short positions the other would be regulatory crackdown across the
5492.24s: sector which would require right the SEC to be completely reformed for them to ruthlessly go
5497.20s: after all shorts for them to scrape through this continuous net settlement system of the DTC's
5501.60s: internal data logs and find out who is short and basically go with you know policemen and FBI
5508.16s: agents and go to those firms and say I gunpoint you know you are closing today or you're you're
5513.44s: you're being arrested and you're going to jail for life like that's the non-negotiable and then the
5520.24s: third is price action so as we've seen like whenever the price has moved to too too high and too
5529.76s: fast we have seen pressure on the shorts to begin closing again like there was some short closing
5536.16s: in jk of 2021 there was some short closing in in March but it was minuscule compared to the overall
5541.44s: value it was like less than 10 percent but there was some and so we know that when these when these
5547.20s: price mechanisms get distorted when the price starts to just rip and rip and rip there is
5553.92s: you know there are obviously like risk management out goes in the market that start forcibly
5559.68s: closing closing including that's something that for start forcibly closing positions against the
5563.84s: will of the hedge fund that is short that's why Melvin capital blew up so people will say that we
5567.84s: have no impact on the market that's completely wrong we do absolutely the question is how do we
5572.88s: get that price action how do we get the price to move it upwards in a very you know aggressive
5577.68s: and rapid fashion and I think one of the ways that that games up could do this is by acquiring Bitcoin
5584.08s: and essentially following the micro strategies you know strategy per se right by adopting yeah
5593.20s: intelligent level but they could do it a better way because micro strategy is like the Dgen you know
5598.32s: crypto gamblers just just issuing billions of dollars a debt and smash buying Bitcoin yeah
5603.92s: dude as soon as we're going down a little bit micro strategy is gonna they're gonna have fun
5609.92s: oh yeah and they already have like my MSTR has done like 330 like there are I don't
5614.32s: people bought the top in the options at 440 and I bought some options I sold them in the 400 range
5619.92s: most of them I have one one call that I'm holding on to the rest of my January calls I was like
5625.20s: dude there's too much risk on the table here I cannot hold on to this yeah but but overall like
5631.76s: the strategy has worked micro strategies has had like a 2000 percent increase since August of 2020
5636.64s: so it has worked and so if games up could do that but in a much more you know maybe measured and
5642.48s: less crypto in a sustainable yeah if they would just buy a 500 million of of Bitcoin and say hey
5649.20s: some of this you know 20% of this excess cash we're gonna put towards Bitcoin and any XS profits
5654.48s: we have half of them will go into Bitcoin the rest will go into cash balance that would be a
5658.48s: completely reasonable and affordable with for them to DCA into Bitcoin and gain Bitcoin exposure
5664.16s: and potentially add a huge upside catalyst to their price so that's what I've been been talking about
5668.80s: and actually I have a group of people that I'm working with and we're working on
5672.24s: drafting the proposals to the board to formally ask them to to consider this strategy
5677.92s: well as long as the word yellow is in there I don't see how they get denied just yeah just
5682.32s: absolutely um I got a bounce in like 10 minutes but I know Kevin there is a couple of
5687.76s: of the things you wanted to hit before we wrap up so I'd love to do that but I'd also love to
5691.68s: comment quickly on the fact that seems like a lot of people have some sort of issue that you have a
5696.56s: a green screen meanwhile I'm sitting with a fucking t-shirt and a halo above my head so I think
5703.28s: you look great I think the screen looks good so yeah you're welcome I built this office today
5710.24s: yeah that's good with your own hands that's the secret yeah as long as you build it they will come
5715.20s: yeah I had this dartboard that just showed it up too in my office because I realized I
5720.72s: loved darks and for some reason when the suns are blasting my eyes I switched positions and now
5726.72s: my dartboard comes through completely clear uh before I get my question either of you guys see
5734.80s: the data on the four nine the five ninety four put on spy yesterday
5741.92s: went from a penny to eleven dollars in twenty three cents a hundred thousand percent gain
5749.36s: yesterday and I was like this well there's no way I'm bent on it because I've tracked every single
5756.00s: fed medium for like four years and usually it's a theta gang day like if the market's up and the
5761.52s: fed medium happens it closes flat if it's down the fed medium happens it closes flat to just because
5767.12s: it's higher IV for the fed day right with rising and lowering interest rates and then yesterday
5773.20s: just imploded for absolutely no reason I mean I was stoked it happened but they haven't missed a
5781.20s: prediction in like forty years on fed rate cuts or raises and so it was all priced in and then
5790.56s: the market has its worst day in years I'm like okay well this is probably something
5797.84s: but my question for you guys going way back in this call to the community of GameStop
5809.76s: what is your best theory on why GameStop discontinued its logo clothing besides my theory of
5824.64s: rebranding what's your best theory on why they wouldn't sell these anymore and they went extinct
5833.76s: first because I don't have an educated opinion on it so I'm going to shut my fucking mouth and
5838.24s: give it to PV on what specifically sorry all the clothing's gone it's been gone for 10 months
5846.80s: there's a million shareholders out there that loved buying it and wearing it some a bunch of
5853.52s: shields in the comments on my posts we're saying low margins and stuff but when you buy a million
5860.64s: t-shirts from China and pretty sure margins are like 75% profit on the corner why did they stop
5867.04s: them completely I don't know I mean what are the questions what are they selling like shorts like
5876.56s: workout shorts no yeah you wanted it t-shirts sweatshirts socks shorts wet pants they had a bunch
5888.00s: of merchandise here that people were buying hand or a fist they almost always said sold out and
5893.76s: you had to go find them in like a physical store why would you stop making them okay I don't
5900.64s: know I mean maybe their excuses like overhead or like having too many employees manage it but I
5908.08s: feel like that would be a really easy thing to manage and I'll even Carol manages his own like
5912.80s: clothing store like by himself and it's not that and they've distribution centers too so they
5919.68s: don't really have to do it and they're sold out online every time like the white sweatshirts
5925.60s: or something came back they're gone within like hours because everyone's posting online buying
5930.56s: them that fast it was going to say to your point Kevin to further the question and speculation
5936.96s: typically people that move the merch have really strong communities that want to merge and I
5941.20s: can't think of yeah companies with a much pre-advertising right so yeah that's a great question Kevin
5948.64s: PB what's the answer I don't know I don't I get well I would love us can't we can't both know
5955.84s: it just makes something up at this point that's why I said rebranding is my theory on it
5962.96s: why would else get rid of it when everyone's buying it instantly as soon as you get new in stock
5968.64s: online I don't know about Swarons because I can't see that but the I don't know the the question I
5974.64s: offer with that is like if so why not can because how long has it been out off the shelves you said
5981.60s: for some time now March it's a lot of misrevenue for rebrands like typically if somebody's going to do
5989.20s: a rebrand you produce up until you go through the rebrand you say this is the last that you're
5992.72s: going to get these and like you don't know what's that unless the rebrand wasn't ready yet
6000.00s: right and I'm not a tin foil person but yeah the point the point I'm thinking of is that you don't
6005.84s: have to stop selling old brand before rebrand I think you can rebrands still sell old brand
6013.12s: and then so your your thought is they were preparing for rebrands stop selling rebrand wasn't ready
6020.80s: and then just didn't start selling again just kind of let it go dormant yeah there could have been
6027.12s: this this massive announcement coming for what it's going to be in you know personally if I own
6036.72s: if I was running going or I own GameStop I wouldn't rebrand because in 2021 more people on
6043.60s: earth knew what GameStop was than Apple probably because of the news articles but if they were going
6050.88s: in that direction then there could have been deals that fell through timing I know I've seen a
6059.60s: lot of data and write-ups on Ryan Cohen's insider trading lawsuit that was going through
6068.48s: a bad bath and beyond and the Wells Fargo fine of not reporting correctly because there's 8,000
6075.52s: loopholes you have to go through to report something perfectly for an SEC report and he didn't know
6080.56s: I do it when he sold Chilly and bought Apple and Wells Fargo and they found out five years later he
6086.88s: typed something up wrong for that million dollar fines there could have been things that
6092.96s: delayed it and then we just saw the partnership a month ago with PSA and Nat Turner coming on
6100.00s: you know it could have been there's obviously a merger and acquisition is usually extremely secret
6107.28s: and takes a lot of time before that article comes out for the filing and so they're easily could have
6114.08s: been things where they could have pulled out maybe something they wanted to buy was
6119.60s: found out to be fraudulent or you know there's a million things that could happen but I cannot
6124.80s: I am I mean I stay up at night trying to figure out why to stop doing it be stides they were planning
6134.16s: on it very soon because it stopped in like March and so maybe May it was going to come out and when
6141.44s: the stock went up 800 percent they're like hmm this is going to be a ton of lawsuits and crap coming
6150.32s: out because the stock just went up 800 percent and roaring kiddies back and everything so they're like okay
6156.56s: it was delay this another 30 days run up happens in June as well let's delay it and then into
6164.88s: July and August was the Wells Fargo stuff on Ryan Cohen my prediction was that they were going to
6173.60s: announce in May something but they're not going to do that for the stock manipulation they were
6181.52s: going to wrecked you know SEC, Fandra everyone the work sir is also sorry a lot of people that
6189.60s: it work and run both of those entities have worked in the very highest up of finance so if you could
6198.00s: find GameStop as much as possible to probably get the calls to do so and Ryan probably sees that so
6206.32s: that's my theory on why to stop selling all GameStop branded clothing.
6215.12s: It's definitely better than mine I if I was a business and they were selling well I would still run
6220.16s: it all the way up until whatever the new stunts and just stop production but I'm not the guy that's
6225.76s: going to collectible item yeah I got to run I have dinner with my mom and if I'm late I'll probably
6236.56s: get a wooden spoon chuck my way but absolutely awesome absolutely awesome hanging out with you guys
6242.88s: for those that are in the chat thank you guys for hanging out and then for PB you have your
6249.12s: YouTube channel and then you're also on X do you want to let people know where they can find it?
6253.52s: Sure I'm on YouTube at Peruvian underscore bowl and same thing on Twitter there's only one
6261.28s: Twitter accounts if you see like Peruvian BOL or whatever that's not me and I'm the only one
6266.64s: with the verified check mark also on Nostra you can find the Nostra and pub in my bio so if you
6273.84s: want to do a decentralized Bitcoin based social media mom there as well. Thanks and then Kevin
6280.48s: for you. On X Malone underscore wealth same as Peruvian we get probably 10 fake accounts a month coming up
6292.72s: they're trying to impersonate and I appreciate everyone letting him and I know when someone's in
6297.60s: personane us but that's my main source. I'm in Malonewealth.com.
6306.80s: Well thank you both so much for the time shout out to your imposter's honestly though they
6311.12s: could step it up not be so cheap by the check market at least like do something but whatever
6316.56s: lazy grifters are gonna be lazy grifters thank you guys for hanging out and we'll definitely
6321.44s: get together again and do it another time. Sweet it sounds good yeah thanks for having me man.
