0.00s:  What's up, everyone? What's going on, Mr. Peruvian Bull? I don't even think I know your name. What's your name?
7.00s:  I usually like to keep my name, my real name on the DL. I can tell you offline.
13.00s:  For sure. So try to stay anonymous. It's like PB good. Like for because Peruvian Bulls are mouthful to say each time.
21.00s:  Yeah, yeah, no, PB Peruvian Bull. Like if you just say bull, that's fine. Yeah, no, all the above are totally fine with me.
31.00s:  Beautiful. Well, I came across some of your work from actually my community. So just to give you like some super, super quick background.
41.00s:  Long time trader been doing this my whole adult life from 33 now. And I came across GameStop long time ago based on some of its initial movements, right?
53.00s:  Because I'm a derivatives trader. So things that exhibit volatility. I'm going to be there like, you know, a moth to light because we're looking for volatility. It's how we make money.
63.00s:  So I traded GameStop for a little bit. And then this most recent resurgence. I was trading it again. But this time I already had the YouTube channel started.
71.00s:  So then I was like realizing that there's a lot more to this than I originally realized.
77.00s:  I didn't understand the story behind it. I didn't understand the different players. I literally was just trading it previously.
83.00s:  So anyways, long story short, started a series where I was looking closer at GameStop because from a trader's perspective, it's like a anomaly, right?
92.00s:  Like I've been trading my whole life and it just completely differently than everything else.
97.00s:  So I cannot help but be fascinated. Then you throw in a character like the cat who you look at him. And this dude's losing 200 million dollars in a day.
108.00s:  And he doesn't care at all. Like everything related to like logical trade management. It's not there. So it's like it's nuts.
116.00s:  So I became infatuated with it. And then my audience, they were like, yo, do you know this dude? Because he looks at some of this stuff too. And I was just like, oh, perfect.
124.00s:  I'm looking to talk to everybody I can. I met with Richard Newton a little bit. He and I did a couple live streams. And I text with him about the madness that is GameStop.
133.00s:  But that's how I came across you. And I'm absolutely stoked to chat with you about it, man.
138.00s:  Yeah. No, thanks for having me on. I've been involved with the community, you know, since January of 2021. I've been grateful to be here. It has been a while right. And that is, you know, what you mentioned right there is the key point that I think most people do not get is that GME is not like the others.
157.00s:  You know, it is a, it is a complete anomaly in terms of, you know, trying to trade and understand its pricing movements.
165.00s:  Like it doesn't follow the normal laws of supply and demand. And that's what has has changed people to use on the financial system and made people realize that there's a lot of stuff going on beneath the surface with regards to stock lending, you know, settlement plumbing options derivatives that doesn't normally occur with other stocks.
183.00s:  So yeah, it's, it's an incredible journey. And I think if you the deeper you go down the game top right the whole the deeper you'll realize, you know, how little you understand about the stock market because this thing is a behemoth.
195.00s:  And there's a lot of skeletons in the closet.
198.00s:  I think that's one of the what you just said there is been one of my favorite things about this because I have, you know, buddies that trade that I'll talk with them be like, dude, like, why are you so obsessed with like understanding GameStop, you know, move on, do something else.
210.00s:  And I try to explain to them, I was like, the most interesting thing I find about GameStop in like the ape community, which I continue to reiterate like I view myself as a guest, right, because I'm I traded it for a while, but I don't know anything half of what long standing people in the community know and I respect it.
230.00s:  But one of the most intricate like intricate details about GameStop is how involved the ape community has gotten with all these small tiny nuanced concepts that you can ask the majority of traders like my friends who've been trading as long as I have.
247.00s:  They don't know shit about it and it's because like from a trading perspective, it doesn't impact us directly. So it's offered me a completely new lens to learn more about this world that I'm obsessed with, which is trading, right? It's what I do.
261.00s:  So the first thing I wanted to ask you though, just so I can gain some more context about your background is you said obviously you're around 2021 what led you to GameStop? Was it like the same as most other people or had you been trading for a while and then pivoted over to that? How did that start?
277.00s:  Sure. No. Yeah. I've been I've been trading since 2016 actually. I'm all of the look. I have a baby face. But I studied. I'm green.
286.00s:  I'm not green. Just late 20s late 20s.
289.00s:  Yeah. I mean, I don't know. I should have asked the chat how old they thought you were first because I would have I would have guessed mid to late 20s. See that that's the other thing that was that you have I'm assuming you're proven right. So you have some brown in you somewhere.
303.00s:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm I'm I'm half-prooping by an American citizen. Yeah. Well, good. Okay. Everybody is worried about deporting this guy. Chill. He's American citizen.
314.00s:  He's a little bit relaxed. If I says listening in calm down, but I it's just effect that like as you could tell I'm as white as they come and we just aged terribly right because when I told you I was 33 you're probably like, you know, this motherfucker looks like he's 45.
329.00s:  But yeah, it's like the exact opposite that you have where you'll look young forever and I look like I'm dead already. So sick great for me.
337.00s:  Well, I know I think you're fine. I think that beard at some and I've grown on my beard to before and it does you look a little more aged. But yeah, if you cut the beard, you'll probably you'll probably like me probably look like a.
350.00s:  And you look like a 29 year old with yeah, look at the child without the beard. It's actually kind of scary. I had my my wife knew me when I was on active duty in the Marine Corps. And she literally is told me like she's like this only time I've ever saw your face.
364.00s:  It's like ever since I went on the reserves and whatnot. I've never seen my face either. So hopefully I won't know what it looks like.
371.00s:  Nice, nice. Actually, my a lot of my family military, my brother was in the Navy. Beautiful. So very curfew years. Yeah, yeah.
379.00s:  Yeah, trading since 2016. Yeah, yeah. So trading since 2016, but I you know, I studied finance economics and I want to go work for a FinTech company.
393.00s:  Doing basically like valuations to work. And so I also had some internships here and there with like, you know, actually portfolio management, but actually like out of college, I went into literal just valuations of small the small the medium size enterprises.
411.00s:  And in 2021, you know, we see this massive rise in the game stop prize. I start following it like the second week. And instantly I'm led to the DD, which is all this older post it from, you know, I'd say fall of 2020 and even before discussing why game stop is a massive value play and why this stock is over short.
435.00s:  And as this talk begins to rise right through early 2021 through this, you know, second and third week of January, you know, I'm working in this in an office building with all the other financial analysts and and valuations managers and CPAs.
454.00s:  And there are a couple guys who are charting obviously because you know, we're in finance. So they want to just make money on the side apart from their day job. And I get a lot of them to start looking to this extra company. So I can alarm GME. So we're all talking about game stop.
468.00s:  And we start noticing like some really weird, you know, movement price movement like, you know, you see the stock rip up into the after hours. And then once it enters after hours, the stock price tanks, we start seeing news news media and coverage come out in insanely negatively on this is the third week of 2020 of January 2021.
489.00s:  And then you see the large shorts like Citron research, for example, a bear traps or bear traps style publisher.
497.00s:  He comes out and he's just like this thing's going to to $5 you guys are all retarded you don't understand short interest like this thing's going back to zero. And the stock keeps rising right past 20 into 30 40 50.
511.00s:  And on the Friday of it was the 20 21st of January, we see the stock price rip up into like 50 and then get slammed down to 30 and then close at 40.
526.00s:  And everyone and it was this kind of sensation of like, okay, this is like a storm coming like what the hell was that like I have never seen a stock rip that much and then collapse in the after hours then close higher like I've never seen that in my life.
542.00s:  And that weekend was kind of quiet right and there were some articles coming out Melvin capital is underwater, you know Citadel is looking into, you know, rescuing them and and funding them.
554.00s:  And then the next week Monday Tuesday the stock price just starts to go parabolic and starts to rip through all barriers right we're talking goes to from 50 to 80 to 100 to 150 to 200.
565.00s:  And you know, this financial media the financial establishment goes crazy.
570.00s:  And as someone who's like again, I studied finance economics, I'd had I'd worked at a large insurance carry before I've I've I've I don't familiar with the
581.00s:  social media right and I had been studying also I was all say this to prior to this I've been studying for about six years macro economics in depth.
589.00s:  You know, mainly focusing on trifincent lemma reserve currencies and I'd also been looking at you know oil markets and so I've been doing a lot of research in that area, but it was separate from, you know, the
602.00s:  more I thought like arcane or just boring stock market I was more into the macro side and but as the stock price began to rip in the entire financial media charted out I was, you know, curious I'm like what's what's their bone to pick like if this is truly a die company that only a few hedge funds are shorted why is the entire financial establishment coming against this, you know, and then two days later we got our answer they shut off the by button.
631.00s:  And froze buying for basically like I was like 175 retail brokers basically the entire retail broker ecosystem and the only places you could actually get orders through or Vanguard and fidelity and the reason why was because those those large, you know, asset managers had their own, you know, they had their own internal inventory of GM be sure so they could sell it to you but otherwise if you try to go to the open market you were enabled to buy.
659.00s:  Right and alright so a lot there so first question though off shooting a little bit what do you think of oil here now oil starting to pop up a little bit.
672.00s:  Oh yeah you know it's in the 70s yeah I well I think oil broadly is a you know indicator of of economic strength right and so and it also is an indicator of of you know how in my opinion of a political desire to lower inflation so whenever they join the SPR and they lower oil prices oil get lower gas prices to me it's a political move and I think that there's no.
699.00s:  There's no doubt that are doing this before the election to help secure you know democratic vote because they want to make the incumbent look better so my opinion if I would a guess on oil prices although I don't follow them as much as I used to far to guess I'd imagine we're going to remain range bound because they're going to try to increase production especially domestically in the US until the election.
720.00s:  Yeah I was surprised that they didn't already announce it to be honest as soon as I started so it start rolling into the high 60s I thought for sure they were going to uncork it but yeah let's see maybe they're just a little slow to the punch here.
732.00s:  Cool so going back to GameStop then when you first started getting involved with it did you set up your portfolio in a way where you're like still trading doing your thing and then had some of it in GameStop are you roaring kitty degenerate level.
749.00s:  All life savings going to something like just getting a scale of how that looks.
754.00s:  Sure so I had a large out of large portfolio invested in large at least you know in my in my in my view wasn't wasn't make less than 50,000 or less than 30,000 total but yeah I because at that point I'd only just started working because I had trouble getting a job during the pandemic but I was mostly in actually gold stock prior to GME.
778.00s:  Gold miners and I bought a bunch of leaps on those and so I liquidated some of those positions and so by the end of January as probably half GME and half Gold stocks but a large part of that was also because of appreciation right because I started buying in at like maybe like 80 and then the price was at like 300 400 so yeah at a certain point I think it was like 70% GME so I agree to a large portion of my portfolio.
807.00s:  Yeah got it interesting because that's one of the things I find so interesting about people who trade GameStop in different ways because my portfolio turnover is exceedingly high right I'm trading so most of my stuff might hold for like a couple weeks so that's why I asked that question is because it's interesting to understand the dynamics of do we let it grow and consume more and more the portfolio do we cut it down move it to other things.
833.00s:  They also think that that reflects a lot of the conviction which it sounds like you were still pretty strongly convicted with the direction it was going.
840.00s:  Absolutely yeah I mean like them turning off the buy button was the answer that that was the answer the question we had we thought can this thing below the financial system and the answer was yes they had to shut off the buy button for a reason because it literally was doing that.
856.00s:  That's what people to understand with with GME right like there's been other stock squeezes before but none of them were ever systemically risky right like this was this was essentially a lean in moment for stock market and so this was difficult for most people most traders to understand and then what happens later right if you if you follow the stock price of GameStop and you follow if you follow the community in those early days after that week after that week right they freeze buying.
885.00s:  They restrict and then they restrict buying for the next week and a half all this media you know fun comes out they tell us that retails dying they've tapped all their savings we're all going into silver it's over the reddit crowd is crazy they shut down the discord there's a community discord for Wall Street bets and then they even have talks about suing reddit for market manipulation etc and over the next few weeks of early February of 2021 the stock price just tanks and it goes all over the market.
914.00s:  And it goes all the way back down to like I think it's like $40 at one point and everyone said like all the traders who like day traders who said like look this is just a squeeze it's over you know you guys should have sold at the top you're all retarded you know now you're all baggolders ha ha ha there's all these beams everywhere right and we all thought we're like you know fuck man maybe that's right maybe this the squeeze is over and maybe they were able to escape maybe maybe they covered up 300 and this is the best way to get the money.
944.00s:  And then it's over and then late February was like 20 February like 23rd or something the stock price after hours goes from 40 to 100 and then the next day goes from 100 to 140 and we're just like what the fuck we are so back yeah we're so back and then over the course of the next month it goes back up to 300 and it touches 300 multiple times and every time it touches 300 we see a whip saw where it gets rocketed down by like 80 bucks especially after earnings.
974.00s:  So look at the look at the history of GME stock trades after earnings it's insane like the stock price will kind of go lower and then in the week or so before you'll run up usually and then after earnings it'll get it'll get slammed and so we saw in March of 2021 I remember watching live the stock price went to like 305 and then after earnings it went down to 150 and then it came back up to like 200.
999.00s:  So it got like I mean again these are moves you never see in another stock you know.
1006.00s:  So the funny part that you mentioned about the moves that you don't see in other stocks I back literally way back in like the mid 2010s I had started buying data from SIBO so that I could test ideas and this is you know a little bit old school compared to what you can do now.
1025.00s:  Every time that I would test different ideas from like an option trading perspective understanding how things work in different size companies.
1033.00s:  Whether it works differently in indices ETF stuff like that and every single time that I would get like these weird returns in the strategies there is a handful of names that kind of became the usual suspects and in the beginning you know it was minor deviations yada yada yada and then all of a sudden you come into like the early 2020s.
1054.00s:  The same fucking name pops up over and over again was fucking game stop was in that cohort of things that just kept breaking all the rules with these different strategies and I was like what the fuck is this.
1064.00s:  So it's funny that you guys picked up on very much of that same anomalous movement now one other question I had for you and then we can kind of pivot to some of you know what the chat wants us to talk about they have a couple questions about like swaps and stuff like that.
1079.00s:  But just another general question for my own understanding one of the things I find so fascinating about the the ape community is I find there to be like a broken a broken approach just in terms of methodology and again this is like from a pure pure trading perspective so a lot of people they talk about mo as we're like wanting to see like this really big squeeze I understand that the part that I don't fully understand is that most of them when I kind of will be able to do that.
1108.00s:  When I kind of will talk to them about like how this works you know what's the plan.
1113.00s:  There's no exit plan for a lot of these people right they kind of just talk about like up or to the moon and from I don't know if it's like if I'm looking at it too literally but from a trading perspective I just think like I get that we want a big squeeze I get that and I love that.
1130.00s:  But but if you hold it all the way through then you don't make money right you still have the same so then to me it almost sounds like it's like a value play right because if we're thinking long term holdings we're thinking long term price accumulation accumulation but there's so much focus on the squeeze I don't get that so to summarize all of that.
1153.00s:  Why is there the emphasis on the squeeze but then the traders don't have like an exit strategy during the squeeze why is that.
1161.00s:  So that's kind of a meme I mean it's it's from the reason why that is is because so okay so during that week right that the last week of January 2021 which was this is kind of like the you know watershed moment that anointed most of the original OG GM E apes but there were other watershed moments like more.
1182.00s:  So in the watershed moments like March of 2021 or April you know or a lot of the earnings events or even like this summer right we saw massive swings in the price in May and June of this year yep and then you know swings in the price of chewy as well and other related stocks.
1199.00s:  During that initial week right people were coming to wall street beds the the audience size was growing exponentially right they got front page of reddit like dozens of times during that week like.
1212.00s:  You know they were the most popular subreddit literally for the entire month and people were referring to D. F. E. and they were saying look like he did this stuff in September of 2019.
1223.00s:  He bought more in 2020 and he's been holding and he started posting these daily updates where he shows his holdings and you see like oh the stock price calls at 201 day he's at like 13 million then it falls down to $100 the next day and then he's at 6 million and he doesn't sell a share and everyone's like whoa and and then this you know kind of climax as you could say in the them cutting off the buy button.
1248.00s:  So after they cut off the buy button there's a lot of panic selling a lot of people freak out in the community they think oh my god the squeezes over they're not going to let it squeeze they're not going to let this happen you know this flood and just negativity spread and D. F. E. tweeted at the end of the at the close of business day a close of market like his update and he hadn't sold a share and everyone was just like holy shit like this guy it's it's another.
1276.00s:  It's like another you know it's a complete wrench in the in the in the ideology of most you know big bank traders right like you're supposed to you're supposed to sell and make money and why would he not sell at the top like you don't understand and then there was an older Reddit response for him when people asked him what is extra strategy and he said what is the next strategy yeah his goal is to hold it forever and so people coalesced around him and they said look he during all this corruption.
1306.00s:  He didn't sell and there's this rage built up from 2008 that kind of boiled the surface and all these posts went viral on Superstalk that day or on sorry on Walsh.
1318.00s:  Discussing the 2008 financial crisis and how it had affected us and they said this is one of our chances to get these people and with them shutting off the buy button people were furious and people started buying GME we saw people who had no money who their last 200 bucks they bought some GME and they said I'm doing this not.
1335.12s:  You know not for any like profit reason but because my brother committed suicide because he lost his home in 2008 or my uncle was investment bank or lost his job lost everything and he went into depression for for 10 years like there's all these personal sources are spreading so people said you know we're not sell were never selling like if they're never if they're going to pull the strings and change the rules we're going to change the rules so the meme was like they should off the buy button we should off the cell button so we won't sell.
1365.12s:  And so the point is yeah so for a lot of people look and a lot of people said you know I'm not going to paint the community as a model because it isn't this is just a group of people who are interested in the same thing just like the big point community but I would say this a lot of people even with hot large number of shares are going to say we're not selling.
1385.12s:  A large portion of our shares because we want the squeeze to happen we want to destroy these hedge funds that have overshorted games up and overshorted bad Beth and beyond an overshorted 50,000 other tickers sense you know they've discovered this naked shorting loop on the FTD loophole and the goal is to bankrupt them right to get them out of the market because what they're doing is damaging I don't know if you've ever heard of seller boxing trading but you know they're not going to be able to sell it.
1415.12s:  So there's a there's documentable evidence from all the large brokers that market makers hedge funds and then the banks themselves have been engaging in predatory naked short selling practices and this has been by the way this has been going on for decades there's a court case in 2005 that was brought before that went all the way up to a Supreme court that actually forced a lot of public attention on this and it also forced congressional hearing.
1445.12s:  So there's a lot of things which made the SEC implement reg show and they created the threshold list showing like how many days stock has been overshorted and if it's more than I think it's 1% of the float.
1459.12s:  Oh no if it's FTD if it was 1% of the float is FTDing for 5 trading days consecutively you get put on the threshold list and so all these implementations got put in place in the early to mid 2000s because this was known to be an issue I mean there was CMK diamonds there was um oh there's another one there's an investor by the name of global links Richard Simpson or Robert I think it was Robert Simpson an investor from Nevada.
1488.12s:  He bought all the entire float of a real estate holding company that was the public listed and the next day 100 million shares traded and so he basically sent a complete to the SEC saying what the fuck like how how are shares able to trade if I own all of them.
1507.12s:  I'm not broke into account and no and and by the way yeah and and actually I should he didn't own all of the own 111% of the float so he owned more than all of them so he was like how is it possible that literally the entire like multiples of the flow is trading when I own the whole thing and I'm not trading it with anybody.
1527.12s:  It shouldn't happen right and so theoretically theoretically and so this started to like what happened is the game shops quickly became for you know I quickly switched from a you know I would just say like a funny
1546.12s:  global event in financial market history into almost like an active crime team investigation where we saw you know mathematicians data analysts financial analysts like going through the data and saying like look at all these anomalies this is weird or finding historical examples of naked shorting in predatory practices from hedge funds and saying like this is wrong like I can't believe they were able to short you know 200 300% of float maybe more than that this is predatory and what they're doing is destroying companies.
1576.12s:  And also obviously putting the disability of the US stock market at risk and so that's when GME started to switch into almost like a you know active investigation and some people just became curious and learning as much as they could about the stock market and the plumbing and that's when we got brought Dr. Tion and Adam it has a series which I don't know if you're familiar with that stuff but yeah we went really deep into the plumbing and we found out a lot of shady shit.
1605.12s:  A lot yeah definitely I am I'm actually pretty good friends with Dave Lauer who I spent a while talking about like the internal mechanics of this stuff in the in the early days but.
1617.12s:  The from a trading perspective I think it's one of the things that's just so fascinating to me because like from.
1624.12s:  The way I look at it is the more money I can make on the movements the more I can ultimately buy so it's a really interesting thought process to learn right like they turn off the buy we turn off the cells just it's very interesting to me so thank you for the detail there because again like I really.
1644.12s:  I enjoy learning about this stuff so much because it's so different from a lot of the stuff that I look at which is yeah kind of boring at this point it's same same day over day of course now when we get into the world I think I did I want to say like three or four live streams with Newton early on before he started like you went back to his job and all that's like super busy now but.
1672.12s:  He was teaching me a lot about like the background the history and those kinds of things so I he's kind of been my general scribe or understanding the context here now one of the things that I find so interesting about a lot of the due diligence that I come across is that there it I don't even know how to describe it it's almost like there's like fucking tentacles where as you're looking at something you're trying to follow this train of thought then there's like this little offshoot here that great.
1701.12s:  Offshoot here that grabs this other interesting thing and then this off shoot over here that grabs this other interesting thing when you think about like the broader case for GameStop right like the the main thing not going off all the offshoot the tentacles but like the main case for GameStop just in terms of a company and its viability it's future what you view that as as it sits today.
1725.84s:  So I would say there's actually two large aspects of this right obviously you know the first is the short sweet document so you know GameStop again this is where we start to get into maybe controversial territory because someone who's looking at short interest today will say the short interest sits at 22% or 28% or whatever is that.
1748.12s:  And I would say sure that's what the reported short interest is but if you followed GameStop back in 2021 you remember seeing finra data showing 140% short interest and then they found out during that week of the last week of January 2021 that 140% was the technical limit that they were that finra was allowed to report short and other people found other brokers reporting 220% short interest and 315%.
1778.12s:  So we quickly realized and that combined with some volumetric data and just the you know the amount of FTDs on the stock were like holy shit they probably shorted multiples of the float and there's basically no way to close this position and the you know the argument that other traders had for years right was well or maybe not years but for most of 2021 most people who are skeptical of GameStop were saying look.
1808.12s:  Yes, there was a huge overbilled of short interest that short interest was evaporated with in the run from $10 to 300 400 it's all over you guys miss it.
1820.04s:  Just any that is crazy right in the run from 10 to 300 400 dollars sorry it just the numbers sometimes when we talk about this stuff it never escapes me how fucking crazy that that in and of itself is.
1834.04s:  Yeah, but it should have gone into the thousands.
1836.20s:  Right right like I'm I'm completely serious like I know before before we yeah the CEO of interactive brokers Thomas Petterfee went live on CNBC on January 28th and he explained he was first of all he's crying and saying you know we need to stop this we need to you know this is market mania but then they're asking what was happening he was saying like our settlement system was breaking like the FTDs were forcing continuous net net settlement to sort of force close all positions.
1866.68s:  And he's like if this had if we hadn't knocked the by button we would have seen a general stock market meltdown because literally the CNS the way it would work is if there's FDs that are you know being forced to close they'll they'll go to your brokerage account.
1884.04s:  They'll override even the hedge fund like their ability to to manually trade or input trades it'll override their ability to manually trades manually trade and it will start liquidating their positions.
1895.72s:  And using the cash the debits to fund purchases of GME and so he's like with you know what was it I think it was like man it was insane it was like 70% of the float that week was expiring in options.
1910.36s:  And with 140% reported short interest but obviously probably higher around 200% and with buying at record highs obviously each of these days was like 80% by volume.
1922.52s:  He's like there was a shortage of hunt like we're talking hundreds of millions of GME shares and the float at the time was 80 million.
1929.48s:  So he's like everything is 85 million so he's like how would you fulfill that he's like you can't so he's like the price would go into the thousands and he used the word plural thousands
1939.32s:  for a reason. And so I mean we saw like this will shock most people because again most people don't don't realize this.
1946.60s:  Some people tried to do fractional sales on the morning of of the 28th.
1951.08s:  Oh right yeah I heard this.
1952.36s:  And some of these fractional sales sold for 2600 30 200 and the highest was like 5200.
1960.12s:  So they were selling shares for 5200 dollars in the in the in the few seconds before they turned off the buy button at around 9 30 a.m.
1968.68s:  Eastern time so or I think it's 935 or something yeah so like five minutes into trading like they literally this thing was
1975.40s:  it was breaking the settlement system literally right and so that's what people need to understand like this is not a normal stock and then it's not a normal squeeze either right even Volkswagen didn't see
1986.60s:  didn't see this kind of activity and so yeah this changed the entire market infrastructure and everything.
1994.84s:  Now when looking at something like the squeezes I think the idea of like how far something goes
2002.28s:  I get the premise right behind theoretical movements but I assume people know that
2012.36s:  governing bodies aren't going to allow a financial system to collapse because of this.
2017.88s:  So it unfortunately will come at the cost of people not being able to buy the shares or whatever and it shouldn't happen because of the institutions that are
2027.88s:  systematically short that are causing the fucking problem but still that being the case in the reality like regulating bodies still aren't going to permit like a broad collapse right that's why they stepped in.
2039.88s:  How do you like when you think about that how does that factor into the way that we think about
2047.64s:  GameStop and like future squeezes and stuff knowing that that that there is a backstop
2052.52s:  Well I would say I would say this right like they would allow they can allow significant damage to take place but they cannot be right they cannot allow systemic failure and so what happened in January 2021 was literally the early stages of a systemic failure.
2069.16s:  And again at most people thought that this was a short squeeze but when the when the House Financial Services Committee report came out in October of 2021
2078.68s:  They looked at the internal SEC data and found that it actually was not a short squeeze January 2021 was not a short squeeze in the short.
2085.48s:  Oh yeah I read that I read that report it was fucking wild it is wild right because that that changes everything it's like holy shit these positions are still open.
2096.20s:  And they're they're probably unclosable so you're right like okay so you know the financial authorities that be don't want to system wide collapse but they obviously
2107.88s:  They can and they will allow
2110.20s:  large players to collapse. I mean we saw the collapse of
2113.72s:  You know Melvin capital. We saw the collapse of Citroen research. We've seen Bill Hwang's fund
2121.88s:  Was it Archie Archie goes Archie goes or K goes yeah archie goes or whatever you call it
2127.88s:  Which is kind of funny because if you think of it the way that the fund is pronounced Archie goes. It's like yeah
2133.32s:  Basically it's a kind of a narcissistic name and then credit suisse and again all this stuff right like may not have been connected on the surface
2140.76s:  But when you look through some of the internal documents
2143.64s:  It there's the credits like for example the credit suisse position with their their total return swap position with Archie goes
2151.32s:  the
2153.56s:  You know the no-sional losses on that spiked in the last week of January and the last week of February of 2021
2160.68s:  And so they don't they don't disclose what's exactly in the in the basket swap
2165.40s:  But it's high it's obviously that that's gm is one of them and my conversations with Dario who's another
2172.84s:  Financial analyst and commentator also confirm that he knows people at those banks and he's like yeah
2179.96s:  From what I've seen gm was a large portion of the short position of those swaps and again
2185.64s:  The problem with the swaps and derivatives in general is that all this stuff is off balance sheet right it's
2191.80s:  It's not reported in the same way that most positions are reported so we can't see it as easily
2198.68s:  Not to say that there's nowhere to see it, but even if you even the information we do have is limited so
2204.12s:  But yeah, no yeah
2205.64s:  Just one other note on that for people because I I spent a while looking into the swaps for folks and we'll talk about those a little bit more in a few moments
2213.56s:  But I think another problem that people don't understand
2216.76s:  In general with swaps is that they're highly
2220.04s:  individualized so
2222.52s:  Understanding the terms of an individual swap is essentially impossible to comprehend so let's because it's unknowable to most people
2231.64s:  So because even you know, we can see if it's something that can be rolled or not technically
2236.68s:  But there's nothing that says that that contract can't be closed and anyone can be opened which is
2241.88s:  Roll so yeah, I just think it's an important note for people because I see a and a lot of interest in swaps trying to understand the impact
2250.28s:  You know that I can have on price movement and that's one of the most difficult parts about using swaps is
2255.64s:  It's kind of like looking into a little bit of a black box. We have some details
2259.88s:  But they're like literally opaque is like one of the best words I can think of for them because they're also very very
2267.00s:  Modifiable by the governing well the two parties that are involved
2271.16s:  Yeah, yeah, no, I would agree with that
2273.96s:  You know, I would say though that there are general
2277.40s:  You know from my study of the swaps like there are general like outlines they use so it's not like every single swap is the
2284.76s:  You know a completely new invention with new terms there's standards and rules and procedures so it's like
2290.68s:  Most swaps will have the same basic
2293.00s:  You know factors right same basic formats and so
2297.40s:  But you're right there are there opaque you don't know the exact terms and you don't know how well they're hedged
2302.28s:  Because again, this is all off balance sheet and so that's why the swap predicting the price with swaps is very difficult
2308.60s:  Yeah, very difficult
2309.96s:  Although it has been it has been accurate a few times
2313.24s:  I've ran I've ran a really significant
2315.96s:  regression on a bunch of these different general ideas
2320.68s:  swaps FTD's FTD's on various ETFs containing other baskets
2326.52s:  FTD's on game stop itself
2329.24s:  Even technical indicators. I was just looking I ran like 162 standard technical indicators to understand correlations and then regress them
2337.32s:  And it's it's really interesting because to your point you can always find instances where something will line up
2343.64s:  But like the predictive capability broadly is is very low which is yeah knowing but is what it is
2351.24s:  Yeah, yeah, but to your early point right like you know what will happen well they
2356.52s:  I think you know, there's a little bit of a tinfoil around this right is
2362.68s:  Oh
2366.44s:  Oh, there you go. There you go nice my wife made that specifically for these as soon as I hear tinfoil
2373.24s:  I have my shit ready there you go. I love it. I love it. The two little horns are great too
2378.44s:  So waking hat yeah, yeah, no, look there's a there's tinfoil, you know kind of theory
2386.20s:  Out there that
2387.48s:  Ryan Cohen is is planning you know
2391.24s:  Basically to allow the squeeze to happen again and the it what they're what they're you know working with the SEC
2397.24s:  For is to prepare the way so that it isn't systemically
2400.60s:  It won't crash the entire system that it'll only wipe out the bad players that they want to wipe out
2406.20s:  And it's fascinating. Yeah, yeah, and there is some there's some
2412.12s:  There is some evidence around this right like Brad Cohen is
2416.52s:  I was gonna see could you talk to me a little bit more about I'm fascinated by that that's crazy
2421.40s:  Yeah, again, this gets into the you know
2424.12s:  This is the spicy financial tinfoil. I'm not I can't I'm ready confirm all this stuff
2429.72s:  um
2431.24s:  But I've discussed it with Ian Carroll multiple times and you know, there's
2436.60s:  There's just some weird coincidences. So for one
2440.36s:  Ryan Cohen has
2443.32s:  Something called it's called Teddy Corp
2445.88s:  Which is yeah, basically a bank that he's incorporated um and he's been using that bank to
2451.88s:  fund loans and other investments
2454.28s:  Um into companies and one of them for example is BBB why and where Ryan Cohen is listed as a creditor
2461.24s:  And so the question is like if Ryan Cohen's focus on a game stop
2465.32s:  Why is he investing in BBB why and why is he taking an interest to
2470.28s:  You know toys are us and his Teddy Corp seems to be almost like
2474.92s:  planning to make strategic alliances with other
2478.92s:  um
2479.88s:  With other large uh companies
2482.76s:  um to basically can basically form like a conglomerate that can fight Amazon
2489.24s:  um, so like again, you can think
2492.44s:  uh
2492.68s:  Like the CEO of Flexport which is Flexports of global logistics and shipping company
2497.88s:  um he and Ryan Cohen have been in in contact and they both follow each other and the CEO has now started tweeting stuff
2504.52s:  That's pro-GME and pro like
2507.64s:  Ryan Cohen in general
2509.32s:  And it's like well why you know if again we aren't able to have the actual
2515.48s:  Conversations or
2517.16s:  No one is like stalking them and has like photo evidence of them together
2519.96s:  But there's just enough coincidence where it's like okay here. We see this bill this contract between
2525.56s:  You know Teddy Corp or and Flexport and here we see them follow each other on Twitter and then start to tweet at each other
2532.28s:  Like why would a global shipping company
2534.76s:  That's mainly deals with like large containers and imports exports from Asia
2539.72s:  Why would they be why would he be talking to Ryan Cohen when most you know he doesn't really deal with that stuff
2545.96s:  GMEs
2548.04s:  Game stops uh, you know
2550.52s:  What's called their supply lines are already set up. They don't need
2554.28s:  Yep, they don't need to to change anything and so because especially video games like the you can produce that here domestically
2560.44s:  And then just ship them to your stores. So you don't need international distribution
2563.80s:  Um and most games are searched in the US anyways. Although there's obviously there there's someone canada
2568.20s:  I think under a different name, but um
2571.80s:  Yeah, no, so
2573.40s:  Like there's just these weird coincidences that have been popping up and another one is um
2578.20s:  Ryan Cohen's brother Brad Cohen is on Twitter and he's been following a bunch of GME and then like Teddy Corp people and
2586.28s:  Baby why people and apparently I don't can't confirm this but I've been hearing that he's been talking to people
2592.28s:  And so it's like why is you know Ryan Cohen's brother wouldn't be doing this without Ryan Cohen's blushing
2597.72s:  And so um what's going on and again the theory is
2602.76s:  The broader theory is Ryan Cohen
2605.64s:  Basically, so his entire upbringing was you know extremely hard work entrepreneurship and honoring his father who has passed away now
2614.84s:  And his father was really for honesty and transparency and and had a very strong but still the very strong moral compass in his sons
2621.72s:  And so that's why with Ryan Cohen's you know most successful venture chewy
2626.20s:  He ventured to take on Amazon. He wanted to
2629.56s:  Stick it to the big man because he thought and I think he's right
2633.40s:  Amazon engages in pretty predatory you know business practices
2638.36s:  both on the in the you know
2642.52s:  Both on the guns like the the employee side meaning like they take advantage of those employees in the in the workshops
2648.04s:  They give him like 50 minute P-brae or like five minute P-brae
2651.24s:  Minute lunches like you have to clock and clock out your constantly monitored
2655.80s:  They time you and if you're slower than normally of disabilities you get an injury. They they axiomedially
2661.88s:  But also on the you know maybe more like financial predatory side
2666.68s:  There's a quite a few famous dd pieces one of the one of which was called um
2671.64s:  Amazon bust out schemes
2673.80s:  discussing
2674.92s:  How Amazon had worked with main in capital which is a private equity fund owned by Mitt Romney
2681.64s:  To take over other
2684.04s:  You know struggling retailers and bankrupt them and then have Amazon coming in swoop the assets and absorb them
2690.04s:  Basically a way for them to kind of like poison pill their competitors
2694.68s:  So they could install right like Amazon could use banning capital to
2698.76s:  Install
2699.96s:  Bad leadership into the boards of these companies like Sears or like Toys or Russ
2704.60s:  They could load the company with debt. They could drive down sales
2708.60s:  purposely tank the company once it goes into bankruptcy
2711.72s:  Amazon because maybe Amazon is a creditor or the owns some shares
2715.32s:  They can get first lean and they can
2717.32s:  Buy all their assets for pennies on the dollar and that way not only did they take out a competitor
2721.40s:  But now they gain all these all this inventory and assets and storefronts and you know square footage that they can now
2728.20s:  In shipping trucks and logistics and everything that they can now use to grow their own empire
2732.36s:  And so the theory is Ryan Cohen saw this happening
2736.76s:  He took them on first and the name you know in the in the sense of chewy he took
2742.04s:  Built this billion dollar company that was able to finally defeat Amazon as own game and just provide better you know
2748.52s:  dog food
2749.80s:  Delivery service and now he took on game like in 2021 he took on game stop as his new pet project of like taking on now
2758.12s:  He's going to take on Amazon and the video game
2760.68s:  On the video game front and his actions with Teddy corp
2764.28s:  You know for example investing BVB why make people think like wow he is
2769.08s:  He is combining like a corpits who style form of businesses and a corpits if you don't know what that is is in Japan is
2778.12s:  Post-war Japan all these companies would combine together and work together towards common goals and so it wasn't exactly like a
2785.88s:  You know
2787.40s:  A cartel I would say it's more like a friendly like it was like we're not gonna come we're not gonna undermine each other
2792.12s:  We're gonna work together. We're gonna try to you know
2794.44s:  We're all trying to get at the same goal right the the glass manufacturer wants to make money the tire manufacturing wants to make money Toyota wants to make money
2800.76s:  And he's like they're like why don't we all coordinate on import export contracts on engineering standards on et cetera
2807.72s:  Et cetera, et cetera so that we can all get the best make the most money and provide the best value for our customers
2813.12s:  And so that's what what the theory is that he's doing that he's
2817.08s:  Conglomerating all these smaller businesses
2819.80s:  BBY GME chewy, you know toys are us and he's like I'm gonna
2825.32s:  He's like none of these individually can take on Amazon
2828.44s:  But if we combine them all together and have the global shipping and flexboard and have a bank in Teddy corp
2834.60s:  all of that combined
2836.20s:  Can can take a shot at Amazon and so that's that's the tin foil and again
2841.80s:  I'm not I'm not saying it's right. I'm not saying it's wrong. I'm not saying anything about it. That's just the theory
2847.40s:  I love me some tin foil that's part of the fun of this is seeing these different dots get connected because I mean
2855.72s:  I have to wear the hat right when I hear a lot of this stuff
2858.68s:  I can see how people might be interested in elements of it
2862.44s:  But from like again, I'm a data driven human
2865.96s:  So I see a lot of loose connections happen stance from like a trading perspective
2870.68s:  I'm not trading off of any of that
2872.68s:  But the theories are fucking fascinating and you cannot help but find some of those
2878.28s:  Coenseld dental things interesting now whether or not they represent something or don't
2883.56s:  It's again. It's very difficult to tell but they're interesting nonetheless
2888.52s:  So yeah, and also this too we do know that that like there's a legal documents from GME
2895.40s:  of their
2897.00s:  Of them signing, you know, NDAs in contracts with the SEC for an investigation
2902.76s:  Into naked short selling so we know that GME has provided documents and evidence to the SEC
2909.48s:  For a lawsuit on naked short selling and manipulative stock market practices
2913.40s:  So we know that like those are very farfable facts against any of the links after the show if you want to see it
2917.56s:  But like we know that they've worked with with the SEC in the past and and again the theory is that it's bigger in that all the stuff
2924.84s:  It's just they have to hide it behind the scenes until the master plan is ready
2930.12s:  Yeah, interesting
2932.12s:  So I want to get to the chat they've dropped in a few things and I'm going to start from the beginning um
2938.76s:  Diego is asking about just talking about GME swaps so maybe I gotta take this off my head's hot
2944.84s:  Um, and I'll wait until we get back into tin foil to to reshoot but
2950.12s:  Sure, could you talk a yeah, could you talk a little bit about just GME swaps broadly and then Diego if you're still in the chat
2955.88s:  If you have like ancillary details to help us
2958.92s:  Get on target with what you're trying to cover with respect to GME swaps
2962.92s:  Um would love that but
2965.32s:  Yeah, maybe just start from a high level with GME swaps how they seem to fit into the picture
2970.92s:  Well, I would say the pictures are also bigger than the swaps right we had large amounts of out of the money puts
2978.12s:  covered caught like uh in the money calls
2981.08s:  um, you know
2982.76s:  A lot of derivative action around GME especially around key like you know settlement dates are earned
2988.52s:  dates or FTD expiration dates that showed us in 2021 that there was something going on beneath the surface
2995.08s:  So in march of 2021
2998.84s:  um
3000.04s:  There was uh a financed professor
3003.64s:  browsing through bloomberg and he he's been you know published multiple times on super song and he's produced uh really good
3009.96s:  Really good research and he's he's browsing um some of the more bespoke and strange um you know
3018.28s:  functions you can find on bloomberg and he found a
3022.92s:  credit suite subsidiary
3025.08s:  in brazil that had 70% of the float in
3030.44s:  uh
3031.64s:  out of the in in uh in the money calls in game stock
3035.80s:  and and also held about another like you know 30% of the float
3039.64s:  I think it wasn't in out of the money puts and so it was like a huge portion basically the whole float in
3046.84s:  Options and it was held in the subsidiary of credit suites and so people started digging into credit suites
3051.40s:  They're like what the hell is happening? Why is credit suites um
3055.80s:  Why are they holding this many derivatives and then what happened is you know people started he asked bloomberg
3061.80s:  He said is this correct like is am I seeing
3064.60s:  80 million shares worth of options on um on GME held in a brazilian subsidiary
3071.32s:  And 24 hours later and luckily he documented everything so we took video images
3076.44s:  Um and he sent them a chat and
3078.76s:  24 hours later all of that was deleted and they he got a message saying that that um those swap those options were
3085.88s:  uh an erroneous filing and that it had been resolved and that he didn't need to ask any more questions
3092.04s:  And so that was like the first sign like what's going on?
3094.84s:  So what that's when we started digging into credit suites and luckily about a few weeks later or maybe say
3100.44s:  Unluckily for them
3101.96s:  uh credits frees
3103.32s:  Started to enter bankruptcy and the reason why was because of archigos which had failed in you know early to
3110.20s:  Or mid to to late march and archigos had opened up total return swaps with a variety of counter parties
3119.08s:  and one archigos went under because they went long on viacom and
3124.28s:  Paramount and then a bunch of other Chinese stocks
3127.24s:  um
3128.28s:  When they went under the large prime banks on wall street had had a closed-door meeting
3133.40s:  To figure out how to unwind this mess because they didn't realize that archigos had levered its book
3139.32s:  You know 25 to 1
3141.32s:  It was opening up derivative positions five or six times it's
3146.68s:  It's equity value with every single large wall street bank. So it was like you know obviously credit suites jp morgan goldman
3154.92s:  And then no more as well and i think there was a bank of america
3159.56s:  And so they they had this closed-door meeting they said okay, well
3163.56s:  How do we unwind this stuff and jp morgan and goldman told everyone they said well here's what we're gonna do
3168.92s:  We're gonna slow one wind over six months
3171.80s:  due to small block sales of these swaps are like trying to unwind them slowly so that we and we'll all do it at the same time holding hands
3181.24s:  trust me bro
3183.32s:  and
3184.36s:  They said this on this was like you know a friday in in late march
3189.08s:  The open-air business next monday
3191.00s:  We start to see giant block trades in the dark pools or viacom paramount
3196.76s:  gm e as well and obviously all these Chinese stocks and
3203.00s:  Quickly news came out like you know day later holy shit goldman and jp morgan were naked on the deal
3208.44s:  And these guys are they told the triggers to to dump everything and get out now
3213.64s:  So they they these are the banks work right they're they're kind of predatory but
3218.68s:  Um credits credit swiss got stuck with the bag
3222.44s:  So all these swaps you know collapsed in value and jp morgan goldman got out
3228.68s:  Nomura took a hit and credit swiss was left with a huge bag
3233.00s:  And that's part of the reason why they failed not all of it obviously
3235.80s:  But i think that was the main you know it was the straw that broke the camel's back
3239.40s:  Already had
3240.44s:  Issues that had been lingering from 2008, but this was the final you know killing blow that really destroyed them
3247.32s:  And as credit swiss was unwound over april may june of 2021
3253.24s:  You know there were lawsuits that came out obviously and the lawsuits in the discovery process
3257.56s:  produced a lot of evidence showing that archa-gose had been shorting like i said
3263.24s:  GME in some of the calls with the golden broker uh archa-gose
3268.12s:  Managing director was recorded as saying you know we need to make sure we we short these retail stocks
3274.44s:  And then she said are you sure do you mean gme and then he says absolutely and then they go on and and they don't specify the problems
3281.80s:  We don't know again because of this
3283.96s:  The limited amount of of of information on the swaps we don't know how many exact shares
3288.84s:  We don't know how they were hedged
3291.08s:  But if the credits waste numbers are to believe to be believed
3294.44s:  Criticisal loan was counter-party for 70% of the float of gme in swaps
3299.88s:  And they had hedged that with out of the money puts
3303.40s:  So options
3304.84s:  I think the other problem just we're trying to draw linear relationships like that is we also don't know what the rest of their book looks like
3311.40s:  Right, so we can see what the swaps show us
3314.76s:  But we have no idea what the rest of the broader book looks like which is
3319.72s:  Difficult to piece together
3323.00s:  Totally fair holy fair and that is true and you know
3327.00s:  But I'll say this you know credit suites required
3330.68s:  Like a was it like a 30 billion dollar bailout from the Swiss national bank and they had the Swiss national bank
3336.92s:  Absorb most of their toxic assets even then UBS didn't want to take them on
3341.48s:  And even now that you see articles like you know, there's a recent one where UBS was trying to sell off a bunch of toxic
3347.08s:  Credit Suisse assets and had to take a
3349.08s:  60% right off on basically all of it. They had to wind down their
3353.40s:  Commercial property unit their commercial real estate unit that did MBSs
3358.28s:  CMBSs and so
3360.44s:  Yeah, it's we don't know the entire extent, but we know that it was bad
3364.04s:  It was really bad and if again if those numbers are to be believed
3368.12s:  70% of float with just credits we said loan also implies if
3372.76s:  If archa goes had copied this strategy with other hedge with other brokers and done the same basket swap
3379.40s:  Going long some some stocks and going short others
3383.24s:  That means there are more shorts out there and we also know
3387.48s:  Again from Dario from evidence from Dario that in Asia he he's a former
3394.92s:  city group
3397.24s:  structured structured equities
3399.48s:  trader and he was saying that you know in Asia
3403.64s:  He knows that there's at least two other hedge funds that were following
3407.32s:  Bill Huang and archa goes take for tick
3410.44s:  So he's like there's at least three of these guys in Asia and there's probably a dozen more elsewhere that had followed him
3416.12s:  Had long into this basket swap trade because it seemed like free money right and
3421.00s:  To be fair to them right if you don't if you put your morals aside
3425.64s:  It makes sense yeah, yeah, fuck the morals, but like
3429.56s:  It kind of made sense
3431.56s:  The year is 2020 right March 2020
3434.92s:  The stock markets collapsing COVID is hitting the Fed is panicking
3439.48s:  Everyone thinks that the you know the shutdown is going to last forever
3444.36s:  And everyone thinks that coronavirus is the worst virus to ever the worst pandemic to come since the Spanish flu
3450.12s:  Of you know was it 1917 that killed million 10% of the world's population or whatever it was killed millions of people
3457.16s:  The panic that upset that that sets into markets is you know unprecedented
3462.12s:  The first time we've seen in a broad-based equity market markets melt off like that since 2008 and
3469.16s:  They you know that the hedge funds realize like look a lot of these retail stores is breaking more to retailers
3475.80s:  They're not going to get any traffic and if they don't have an online presence
3478.84s:  They don't have a viable e-commerce business line
3481.24s:  They're not going to be able to make any money and so they're all going to zero
3484.52s:  And so it makes sense to do a basket swap that goes long
3488.60s:  Whatever equities you want to go long whether it's zoom or you know Tesla or Facebook all the tech stocks and then you can go short
3496.44s:  You know game stop
3498.44s:  Right, BBBY you know
3501.32s:  Sears whatever any large retailer you want and if you have you know if you have any sense
3507.96s:  You want to you want to put pressure on these trades?
3510.28s:  So you want other people to be in with you?
3511.96s:  So you have idea dinners where you tell other hedge fund traders the same thing
3515.32s:  And again, you're not coordinating but you're just sharing ideas and if they so happen to do the trade and they're making
3520.60s:  8% a month on it
3521.96s:  They're going to love it too and so you can quickly see how multiple
3526.20s:  hedge funds start to pile in to this trade
3529.96s:  Um, and this matches right the finance house financial services report which found there were over 70 hedge funds
3536.28s:  Um, and again, they won't name them which is unfortunate, but there were over 70 hedge funds short game stop
3541.40s:  And 175 retail brokers that shut shut off the right by button
3545.72s:  And so we don't
3547.72s:  Again, we don't know how big this this you know monster is
3552.20s:  But we do know there's a lot of evidence on the swaps showing that archigos and several hedge funds in Asia for sure and then
3560.20s:  Most likely dozens of other hedge funds across the US and Europe went short games up via swaps
3566.12s:  And then the reason why we saw this
3568.36s:  The reason why this this kept popping up is because we started to see
3572.04s:  correlations with some of the swap expiration dates and the running of the stock price because again like
3577.88s:  Like we said at the outset right
3579.72s:  GameStop is not a stock that follows any typical trading you know
3584.92s:  indicators, right it does not follow
3587.80s:  Uh rise decline. It does not follow our assigned necessarily doesn't follow any of that shit
3593.32s:  And we've seen days where you know, you think nothing's gonna happen like I said February of 2021 march of 2021
3599.80s:  This May and June went up was another great example
3602.76s:  If you had said in a week and a half game stops going to be a triple the price you're someone you know
3607.96s:  A no one puts one like you like what the fuck what's the catalyst? Oh, by the way, there's no catalyst no news comes out
3613.88s:  It just rips 200% for no reason and then no one knows and then it goes back down and no one knows why
3620.04s:  It's like well
3621.32s:  Hold on unless retail is
3623.88s:  Collaborating and has more capital than we ever thought they did
3627.56s:  This has to be something else going on this has to be something come happening with the with the plumbing of the system and so again the
3635.56s:  The working theory is they've been using these swaps to get rid of FTD's to kick the can on the road
3641.32s:  Just so to speak to not have to settle the massive obligation that they've built up since 2020
3646.28s:  Because from what Dario is shared with me most of these a lot of these swaps were entered into in March 2020
3652.36s:  So they all got the bag in March 2020 they thought it was just going to print and make money and it's gone the opposite way
3658.52s:  And so they'll have to they've had to find new creative ways to keep kicking this can
3663.72s:  Interesting and there is a follow on question from Diego and Corey with respect to chewy swaps
3671.64s:  So I've seen a lot of interesting theories
3676.20s:  around chuees
3677.96s:  Game stop relationships the swaps as well
3682.12s:  Is there any connection between those as far as you see it?
3686.20s:  So I actually had someone reach out to me about this
3690.60s:  This is really interesting
3693.48s:  So on some of the basket swaps you can see two different legs
3698.20s:  Which can make sense right like some of these let like the leg can mean the receiving or the sending
3703.32s:  pair so you can you can hedge it
3705.48s:  You can do a swap either way where you're either
3708.28s:  Promising to deliver shares or your promise or you're getting a promise to receive shares
3714.12s:  And so if you're promising to deliver shares then obviously you would want to be hedged and one of the ways you can hedge is
3719.16s:  via the opposite market
3721.16s:  and
3722.36s:  What they what we saw in some of this data that this
3725.48s:  Unnamed gentleman shared with me is that on a lot of these swaps obviously
3729.64s:  You see gm e on the first leg of the swap so you see you know
3733.56s:  No shall amount and then you see like tickers and it'll include like six or seven tickers and some of these tickers are really weird
3741.08s:  It's like I would never think like it's a goal like bear it gold mining or like you know
3748.44s:  Some French banks and you're just like why is this included and again, we don't get any answer
3753.88s:  But a lot of them will have gm e on the first
3757.80s:  You know first leg of the trade right so
3761.88s:  That's basically like a promise to
3765.40s:  To send those shares out so those you know that that would have to be hedged
3769.08s:  But then on some of them again some of them the data is is
3773.32s:  They don't release the second leg the data for was the second leg on some of them
3776.60s:  They don't have data on this first leg so it says promise to receive
3780.52s:  And on the receive some of them say chewy
3783.56s:  Mm-hmm and a lot of them that are correlated are the ones where
3788.60s:  gm e and chewy are included in the same basket stock and treated the same by a single counterparty
3793.88s:  But the problem is again, we don't know who that is. We don't know how well it's it's um
3797.72s:  hedged but from what I have seen from the data
3801.00s:  There were a bunch of chewy swaps that are expiring in late September of
3805.56s:  Of this year so it's just you know a week ago
3808.76s:  And I haven't really followed the chewy swaps that much more because for me my main focus is gm e because in my opinion
3814.76s:  And I think most people would agree with me on this gm e has
3818.92s:  Overall a more interesting and compelling story to investigate than chewy but um
3825.40s:  Yeah, there's been from what I've seen on the data. There's been significant correlation like especially that first and second leg
3831.80s:  a lot of
3833.00s:  Sorry
3834.44s:  A lot of times where chewy shows up as a as a receiving leg of a of a swap
3839.48s:  Yeah, okay, got it and that makes a ton of sense. I've seen the same thing actually myself
3843.80s:  the and again the world of swaps I think is
3848.84s:  It's so interesting because of how dynamic they are
3853.40s:  um
3854.28s:  So because I just continue to reiterate that point for people because I think a lot of times when people are analyzing them
3860.92s:  they try to
3863.08s:  create direct parallels and
3865.72s:  And causal relationships which is very difficult. It's so so difficult because a lot of these entities will have
3872.76s:  An amalgamation of different kinds of swaps and derivatives in their entire bulk
3877.24s:  So it's really hard to see what offsets what
3880.28s:  but
3881.24s:  The relationship that you highlight there is I think important for people to understand at least with respect to
3887.96s:  How a lot of these things are seemingly very tied together because one of the things I've done with any sort of correlation analysis is the correlation between a lot of the products isn't
3898.12s:  Really that unique compared to the correlation of most beta products
3902.84s:  But what you will find is the correlation between them strengthens during big moves
3908.44s:  Mm-hmm. That's not worthy is so as soon as that standard correlation starts to
3913.48s:  Expand during those kinds of movements and then break down post
3917.08s:  I think it highlights some movement that happens behind the scenes because that's really what drives any sort of correlation analysis for different time frames
3925.24s:  So I find that
3926.76s:  Interesting. Yeah, you know, they did a study too. I can send you the paper. There was a
3932.44s:  A paper out of a
3934.12s:  University of Bernou in eastern Europe. I forgot what country's me. It was like hungry literally
3940.76s:  Okay, so you've read that so you saw the correlation between
3945.24s:  Jimmy sock price short interest in ETFs and whenever whatever the
3950.60s:  Stock price rose there were 16 ETFs identified as highly correlated or the FDs in the ETF increase along with the Jimmy stock price
3959.08s:  So it's and the borrow rates right so there was evidence that they were abusing
3964.36s:  You know the hedge funds and market makers and others were abusing the ETF mechanism as a way to get shares
3971.32s:  And you know, there are causing FTDs in these in these derivative products like ETFs
3977.64s:  Just because they wanted to get away from the hot potato of GME
3982.12s:  Yeah, well, and then the creation redemption cycle on those ETFs is also I think a big part of that story
3988.92s:  Now one admin note because I remember I was talking with Newton about this too and I am no significant advocate of market makers
3996.36s:  I have a friend that's a market maker
3998.36s:  But I'm not like an advocate of them, but sometimes I feel like
4002.92s:  The their role is grossly misunderstood in markets
4007.32s:  So what like what role do you see them playing from your perspective
4013.56s:  With Jimmy specifically to be clear
4015.56s:  Sure, and actually I you know, I got corrected. I just got some Twitter DMs. I did say you know the regulatory bodies turned off the buy button
4023.24s:  Um, that's an oversimplification. Really it was um
4027.32s:  Clearinghouse apex clearing yeah, exactly shut off the buy button. Yeah, so
4032.36s:  When I said very like I'm more broadly meant like the powers that be the people who are running the plumbing of the
4037.56s:  Of the system. Yeah, I knew exactly what you meant. Yeah, so apologies there, but um
4043.88s:  With sorry, what was your question again? It was about market makers. They're all their role with GameStop
4050.20s:  Yeah, so I've actually put together a couple good Twitter threads about this um
4054.68s:  You know actually at my prior company
4057.32s:  Uh, the FinTech companies working out they were trying to create
4060.76s:  private market
4062.76s:  Exchange essentially allowing people to
4066.12s:  transact shares of private companies on on a limited basis and so all this involved discussions of what is liquidity
4073.96s:  What is a market?
4075.64s:  What's the role of a market maker? What's the role of an exchange? What's the role of a transfer agent?
4080.92s:  How should all this work?
4082.92s:  and
4084.36s:  My view quickly became especially with you know quickly like learning about the
4089.64s:  Naked shorting mechanism and the FTD rules and the loopholes with ETFs, you know that market makers can abuse the authorized participant loophole
4099.40s:  um that our current
4102.68s:  Ideology or market making is completely broken
4106.04s:  In the current market paradigm liquidity is viewed as everything
4111.56s:  So it's like it all you want to do is maximize liquidity
4116.20s:  So the idea is right whether it shares or even just money itself the idea is we need to maximize liquidity keep everything running because
4124.68s:  if things fall apart then they'll be economic pain
4128.68s:  And that can happen either on the buy side or the sell side right if you run out of liquidity on the buy side
4133.88s:  That's talk price can fall and if you run out of liquidity on the sell side
4138.52s:  Then the liquid then the stock price can rip
4141.88s:  and that is true
4144.36s:  And I'm not saying that there isn't an argument for liquidity in general
4147.40s:  But to maximize liquidity as your primary nor star that your
4151.64s:  Exchange or your software is pointing towards is completely broken
4157.32s:  Because what what happens when you start maximizing liquidity is you start minimizing the importance of every other factor
4163.80s:  And you destroy the ability of of a market to function properly anyways
4168.52s:  Right if if you want infinite liquidity then just have a
4172.68s:  An infinite share printer and infinite money printer that just battle each other forever and get rid of the
4179.16s:  Get rid of the reason for even people existing
4181.72s:  but do you think that
4183.88s:  the
4185.08s:  Well, how do you explain the nuance between
4188.20s:  Infinite liquidity and trying to maximize liquidity because I would argue those are slightly different concepts
4193.80s:  Yeah, and I'm being a little you know
4196.28s:  bombastic right with with the with infinite liquidity
4198.44s:  But the point is their goal is to map their goals to increase liquidity no at all costs
4203.88s:  Like that's how the current market paradigm works and that I think is a is a very very
4210.20s:  Bad premise because what what ends up happening right is you get justifications for all of these
4216.44s:  All these abusive market practices naked shorting FTD's ETF flu polls options, you know
4223.32s:  Off-laying settlement you essentially get to a system where all shares
4228.04s:  Never have to be delivered and they can be kicked with FTD's forever because again, it's liquidity
4233.96s:  Hey, we can't deliver the share. We need to we need more of the liquidity
4237.08s:  We need to not let it be sold because then the price would be depressed or the price would rise if there's a lack of shares
4244.12s:  So we need to let we need to let the liquidity fairies do their work and keep kicking this can down the road
4249.88s:  so
4251.72s:  The current system the way I would change it which again might be controversial is having
4258.76s:  Like a very different approach with let me know supply and demand and the idea of like if a stock price starts running
4265.48s:  And there's not enough shares
4267.56s:  The price will go up
4269.16s:  Until there's no more sellers of shares and then it just freezes and we would just watch oh apples at 2000
4276.20s:  Why hasn't it moved because no one's willing to sell and no one's willing to buy higher?
4280.36s:  So it's just frozen and once more people come in then then it'll change
4284.84s:  And so the market under my view maybe would look a lot more jittery
4289.00s:  But I think it would it would reflect real supply and demand and once you want to broker runs out of shares
4294.44s:  That's it. They're done. They can't do this and all of this by the way is possible because here's the thing is
4300.68s:  The DTC runs all the share and trade settlement
4304.92s:  Through a massive sequel database, right?
4308.36s:  They have centralized insight into
4311.40s:  You know through their DTC account the centralized insight into every the positions of every single broker and
4318.44s:  you know
4320.44s:  Market participant that there is and so why can't they have
4324.60s:  Why can't they solve this problem they can and Suzanne Trombath said that it's they're able to do it
4331.08s:  It's just it's a lot of work sure that if it changed some
4334.52s:  Problems with the system that have to probably you know they have to eliminate the ability to naked short
4338.76s:  They have to get rid of uh Ftd bypass rules
4342.36s:  But they can do it but they won't because the system as we know it would grind to a halt it'd be much more liquid
4350.36s:  Yeah, cuz I I hear some of your points. I definitely can see it would be very difficult to implement something that like that
4357.56s:  Specifically from a liquidity perspective, but it's an interesting idea
4361.56s:  And I think one of the other things to note those like the idea of naked shorting is kind of like a perversion of the rules
4368.36s:  Like that's actually side-scirting around
4371.64s:  Existing policy. I'm not so sure that that's something that
4376.44s:  Were we being again governing bodies, but specifically regulators are attempting to to promote or promulgate for the sake of liquidity
4385.80s:  I think it's something that's
4388.76s:  But I don't think it's something that is supposed to be happening
4392.92s:  Well, you know market makers have a naked shorting exemption, right?
4396.60s:  Of course, but their mandate is slightly different because they have a covering window
4402.52s:  And the the premise for them naked shorting is completely different than the premise of institutions naked shorting
4410.52s:  So for them to your point market makers. It's for liquidity for institutions
4414.76s:  It's because they're trying to be cheap and they can essentially gain exposure to things otherwise they might not have access to way way cheaper
4422.76s:  True, but at what point just liquidity start
4426.36s:  destroying prices recovery
4428.20s:  You know again like if
4430.52s:  This is the issues like okay, so let's say we get rid of naked shorting from
4434.68s:  Other institutions other than market makers. Okay, so market makers are the golden boys of Wall Street and they can naked short all day long
4441.80s:  Was to stop them from being the now being the the uh, you know the monoliths of prices recovery
4448.28s:  So they can now say oh well, you know, hey apples rising
4452.04s:  We don't like apple our clients are short apple
4454.60s:  We're gonna naked short a ton of shares today and we're gonna kick them with FDDs and never deliver the shares
4460.84s:  And sell people a bunch of fake phantom shares and make sure the price doesn't go up and what are you gonna do about it?
4466.36s:  Because we have an exemption like it the once you open the door
4469.88s:  It's one of those things where it's like give them a
4471.96s:  Give them an inch they'll take a mile once you open the door a little bit
4474.76s:  You can see how it becomes so logical. It's like well
4477.96s:  Why wouldn't we do this why wouldn't we just naked short every day stock?
4482.12s:  I think it's just important to remember the the game of market maker
4485.72s:  Right like they they're typically not managing a book for a client
4489.24s:  They're typically they make their money by providing markets
4492.84s:  So their entire job is to offer you a bit ask spread at a size so that you can trade what you want
4499.40s:  I understand your point fully, but it's just they the way they make a living they're much more
4504.60s:  Kind of like a scavenger of the market as compared to an entity that is moving as
4511.40s:  As that specifically
4513.64s:  I would I would disagree with you so that I would say that that's how it should be
4517.08s:  But if you look at the the actual structure of the market right now, you know
4521.24s:  Citadel securities is a market maker
4523.72s:  Citadel itself is a hedge fund
4526.20s:  Now those are both owned and run by the same people
4529.64s:  Completely agree and
4530.92s:  Citadel secunds example completely agree with you
4534.12s:  And Citadel the hedge fund
4536.12s:  Shuts down or Citadel the hedge fund extends a $2.3 billion loan to Melvin capital in January 2021 to bail them out
4544.12s:  Of their underwater gm e-shorts right at this two days later an unnamed market maker causes a you know clearing
4554.12s:  I guess you'd call it like error within apex to force
4560.84s:  To force freezing of of buying of all the meme stocks because what happened is somebody made it
4566.36s:  You know this trade 385 some unnamed market maker, but we assume a citadel because Citadel was the designated market maker for AMC
4574.52s:  Um and Jimmy
4576.52s:  And they're just everywhere and they're everywhere
4578.92s:  They're the large they're basically the largest market maker and
4582.76s:  Some unnamed market maker made a $300-85 billion buy-in-sell trade for AMC in the evening of January 27th
4590.12s:  The next day 28th the apex clearing realizes what's going on. They say holy shit
4596.04s:  There's a massive buy-in-sell and under their own, you know internal rules and regulations whenever there's a massive buy-in-sell
4603.64s:  One of the legs of the trade must be manually verified and they hadn't whoever had made the
4608.36s:  trade had not manually verified the sell side so
4612.44s:  Somebody so whoever this market maker one was had logged a buy for 285 million dollars with the AMC
4619.96s:  And then not log not manually logged the sell so they had the sell wasn't the system
4624.44s:  But it wasn't manually logged because through this
4627.32s:  Uh, internal rule and apex clearing and maybe it's true of all clearing brokers. I'm not sure
4632.92s:  Do you have to make if a large sizeable trade is made within one second
4637.16s:  You have to manually verify the trade which makes sense right it's like
4641.24s:  This Tuesday's buy sell within the same second that's
4645.16s:  Is that an anomaly that a mistake was once have the trade not meant to happen
4648.92s:  You know, what was supposed to was supposed to go on here um and then and then the entire you know the entire stock market
4655.88s:  You know freezes and we see all the meme stocks have no buying available for them
4660.76s:  So the conflict of interest here can be you can immediately see see all securities has the ability
4666.28s:  Potentially again alleged none of this is confirmed
4669.64s:  But potential ability to log buy and sell trades massive ones
4674.68s:  Force you know basically like a technical default on the clearinghouse and force them to freeze buying for all the brokers
4682.68s:  And then on the other hand they have their hedge fund saving Melvin capital
4686.20s:  So it's like would they would sit with the guys that said the security help thought the guys in Citadel, you know
4692.20s:  That the hedge fund
4693.80s:  Probably and it's not far fetched to to claim that and that's probably what it all yeah
4699.72s:  That's a problem with a lot of these market makers is that they're not these neutral arbiters of value
4703.96s:  They a lot of them have vested interests one way or the other yeah, there's three of them that three of the big ones that operate also as hedge funds
4711.32s:  Right, so you hit one there's two sigma and then there's Susquehana and then places like flow GTS
4717.80s:  Jane virtue those are strictly market makers exactly and so and that's another thing right the S.A.C. Should look at why
4725.40s:  People like to interest massive. Yeah
4728.52s:  Why are they allowed to be run a hedge fund and a market maker that's insane
4733.80s:  Yeah, no, I completely agree. I think it's straight straight bulls
4738.92s:  Yeah
4740.60s:  So there was a question in here
4742.52s:  Before from one of my favorite user names that I have the pleasure of seeing when I do live stream
4748.12s:  Which is roaring titty big fan of that one
4751.40s:  So we have a roaring titty and then there's normally a roaring clitty. I like those
4756.60s:  Yeah, they're a dynamic duo
4759.40s:  But
4760.36s:  roaring
4761.40s:  Titty was asking I have to find it because I don't want to miss it
4765.88s:  Um was asking about yeah here it is what about Carl icon getting into those swaps in
4773.48s:  Do you know anything about that and while you're responding to that I have to grab another water
4777.24s:  So feel free to kick off and then I'll be back in my two seconds
4782.20s:  Sure, I haven't I haven't looked you know insanely deep into the Kyle Carl icon connection
4787.80s:  From what I know he had gone into the swaps
4791.64s:  um and potentially was even short gm in 2020 but Ryan Cohen's
4798.28s:  A parent friendship with him and pictures with him and and
4802.36s:  You know overall
4804.84s:  Admiration of the guy makes me think that there's something deeper going on there
4809.08s:  So
4810.28s:  Sorry, I don't know a ton about it because I haven't looked into Carl icon that deeply
4813.72s:  But I do know that he was allegedly in the in the swaps shorting in 2020 which maybe he's changed his tune and maybe he's gone long
4822.28s:  Um or close to short position potentially
4825.32s:  Yeah, because when I saw about icon I've heard of that before but I never fully understood what his position was roaring to be saying
4833.72s:  I thought he got smashed with the gm e shorts that's true. That's what I've that's what I've seen yeah
4840.76s:  But if we could strange what strange like I was saying earlier is what strange is why is
4845.16s:  Ryan Cohen so buddy buddy with him. Why does he cozy up to him and I would think that
4849.80s:  Uh probably Carl icon changed his tune close to shorts and then now went long
4854.44s:  As the most likely explanation
4857.24s:  But you know the the saga is not as clear cut as you would want it to be right there's
4863.24s:  There are players with mixed motives and so Carl icon might be one of them
4868.28s:  Yeah, so I just asked
4870.76s:  um
4872.04s:  Chat Gbt. So I always frame at that right because I don't know how accurate it is
4876.28s:  But chat GPT looked at two different websites and it says icon profited from shorting game stopped during the peak
4883.32s:  Of the friends in 21
4885.80s:  um despite these icon experience broader losses with his overall short positions
4893.16s:  contributing to 1.3 bill in losses in 21
4896.92s:  So while the exact amount icon made on the gm e short is not publicly disclosed his gains on game stop did not offset
4904.44s:  The other losses so it's hard to it's essentially a non-answer
4907.96s:  Doesn't tell us yeah what he would have done on the short side or even on the long side
4912.92s:  Yeah, and I also know a lot of hedge funds did go short at the top
4918.04s:  I have 300 I mean it's super logical to be honest again from a trading perspective
4922.76s:  Trading both sides of squeezes um I have a video that's coming out soon that talks about like the the anatomy of a squeeze
4930.28s:  Because the way that I think about trading is I break things down into I call profit mechanisms like what is this specific thing
4937.48s:  That lets me make money and short squeeze or gamma squeeze short squeeze don't really care what causes it
4944.44s:  Maybe better just to call it squeeze
4946.92s:  But the there's very specific conditions and behaviors of
4952.44s:  squeezes that you can trade but one of them is the periodicity they're typically very very short term
4958.04s:  So they're really really really tradable events. It's kind of like if you see massive spikes in vix
4963.64s:  Another highly tradable event. Yeah, I actually used to trade uvxy
4968.60s:  Like the leveraged the leverage. Yeah, it was fun
4972.44s:  It's fun you can make a lot of money and then you can lose a lot of money very cool
4977.40s:  That's the beautiful part about markets right is like it's just this game of taking money out of the machine
4982.36s:  And then just giving it back and then you look at it and you're like well
4985.72s:  Fuck I need to make that back again. So then you go back again and here you are
4990.44s:  In the virtuous cycle of trading
4993.96s:  Yeah
4994.92s:  Well, this is the issue right like it's become
4997.64s:  Markets that become a gambling mechanism. Oh, I think I'm afraid to yeah, it's gamified
5002.52s:  But it's become a gambling mechanism and again because why because we've allowed
5008.60s:  This the derivatives and the higher order functions of the market to
5015.40s:  Super seed the actual market itself
5018.52s:  Right
5019.88s:  Let's go back to the original argument about you mean as like a price discovery mechanism. Yes
5024.20s:  Yes, what's the primary role of a market to be liquid or to have price discovery right you can
5031.00s:  Yeah, it's a spectrum where it's like if you go further down the liquidity side
5035.32s:  You're giving up price discovery and so if you want markets to be truly truly price discovery
5041.00s:  You would have to put in a bunch of restrictions that are not in place today
5044.60s:  You'd have to eliminate naked shorting eliminate FDD loopholes all that stuff
5048.68s:  But more so you know, you'd have to limit derivatives you would have to say look like
5054.20s:  There's a hundred million shares of the float
5056.28s:  You know 30 million on by retail for 50 million on by institutions only leaves us 20 million
5063.00s:  We're not going to allow more than 10 million
5065.72s:  shares in terms of options to be sold and if that limit gets reached
5070.44s:  Hardstop no more options can be sold that would that's what those are the restricts that would have to be put in place
5075.40s:  Because again, you couldn't have a market where the derivatives have a claim on more shares than actually exist
5082.60s:  Right
5083.40s:  Well, I guess the only problem with that is if you look at the way that
5088.04s:  Derivatives are typically resolved it's it's
5090.60s:  Not through the movement of the underlying so I fully understand your point in terms of essentially making it
5096.68s:  So that it would be secured by the underlying itself, but the overwhelming
5101.40s:  The overwhelming resolution of derivatives is trading in and out before expiration. It's just average
5106.76s:  You're right. It's cash settlement most derivatives are but again, so here's another systemic risk of markets
5112.68s:  What happens if everyone exercises?
5115.48s:  Oh right. Yeah, what happens? It's the same thing what happened with with Nixon is 71
5119.96s:  What happens to all these goals certificates if people actually call your bluff and say I want the gold
5124.20s:  What happens to all your gme options if everyone says
5127.40s:  Holy shit you guys are manipulating the market. Well no longer do I want to trade my option to get 20k
5133.88s:  I want my shares and I want them now and I don't give a fuck about the money anymore
5137.80s:  I want to stick it to when I want to hold these shares because that's what happened like in
5141.80s:  2021 people started exercising their options. They didn't sell them no one wanted to sell
5147.24s:  I've one's like giving the shares. I want to stick to Wall Street and so
5151.64s:  And their models don't count for that the models will say oh
5154.84s:  2% of all options will be you know exercise for shares or 10% or whatever the number is a fraction of the total
5161.08s:  What happens if 50% of them say they want to exercise which is a non zero probability
5165.16s:  So these are the restrictions you have to put in place on a market that was strictly based on price discovery and did not maximize liquidity
5171.96s:  Because that kind of market with a fixed share count and four settlement all the time you can't have options running amok
5179.40s:  Well, and the other funny part there is you think of well as I think about your theory that's really fascinating is
5185.24s:  If you consider the fact that you know when options are in the money coming up on expiration right market makers
5191.56s:  Are typically going to hedge with the underlying expecting to deliver but to your broader point
5195.72s:  If people that are out of the money just decide to exercise and get their 30 shares on their 30 delta's or whatever
5201.16s:  Or you know whatever the equivalent would be at that point in terms of what they would like that's fascinating
5206.76s:  Because yeah, you're right. That would be a massive stress test
5211.24s:  But I guess the the reason why we think about it the way that they do in terms of markets is just it's completely irrational
5218.36s:  Again to your point if the rationality is to stick it to Wall Street now
5222.04s:  That's a completely different angle that I don't think a lot of people have considered to widely
5227.24s:  This is this is part of the broader issue. So this is this is the philosophy of markets which I've studied a lot of actually
5233.64s:  This is part of the broader issue with how financial you know, you know
5238.12s:  Financial education economics education is taught
5241.32s:  We're taught from day one of any college course either undergraduate or graduate course
5248.52s:  that
5250.12s:  Markis exists with a random walk and Brownian motion is the key governor of you know price movements
5257.64s:  What is Brownian motion Brownian motion is the idea of
5261.24s:  uh random motion of of atoms or cells or any you know almost any entity in a
5268.52s:  What's called the non dynamic system in physics? So just one quick admin note
5273.96s:  This is we're talking about a theoretical con because obviously we would know that markets
5279.16s:  Markets exhibit
5280.76s:  Geometric Brownian motion tendencies at points
5283.40s:  But it also has things like drift right positive drift. So that's not Brownian motion
5288.04s:  That's long-term drift is highlighting for the audiences. They're listening that there's like different levels to the to the concept
5293.80s:  Yes, obviously, but the problem is the theory of markets like the EMH for example, right?
5299.64s:  Aficionate markets have all sorts that's based on Brownian motion
5303.88s:  Being valid and true at all points continuously across all asset classes
5309.08s:  And it's also based on you know, some things are nonsensical
5312.44s:  Equal and true information given to all participants simultaneously
5317.08s:  Infinite liquidity infinite let like these the seven tenants when i was in college and
5323.08s:  The professor laid out the seven tenants of the EMH and he had a study it
5328.12s:  I look through it on the first day of on the first day of that class and i was like
5333.40s:  What the fuck all these are wrong like literally there's not a single one here. That's correct
5338.20s:  I'm like how are you teaching like it's it's irresponsible you're lied to us
5343.24s:  How is this right that this market isn't efficient and the more i've read the more research right
5348.28s:  Oh our stock market is duely portray Brownian motion
5351.88s:  And psycho you said maybe at certain points they do but for the vast majority they do not and the issue is when you build all your mathematical models around brownian motion
5361.08s:  And a geometric mean and normalized data that's safe and easy to understand
5366.76s:  You you create
5368.84s:  You know algorithms you create trading patterns you create things that work
5373.08s:  You know 98% of the time but then absolutely blow you out of the water
5377.00s:  2% of the time and those times it blows you out of the water
5379.72s:  And it if it does so in a big enough way it can cause a systemic crisis
5383.24s:  There's a really great book on the 1987 crash
5386.60s:  Called when genius failed i believe it is yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely
5391.88s:  But but in that book they described right like how this crash happened right how that portfolio insurance and
5399.16s:  You know the derivatives and the the the interplay between the sp wife futures and the portfolio insurance
5405.08s:  We're kicking in and they were shorts and then the short arb should come in and short the
5409.40s:  Underlying stocks but then buy the futures and then as the futures tank they have to sell more of the futures and keep short in the stock
5414.92s:  It's like it was a negative feedback loop right or say a positive feedback loop that worked negatively to drive the market down
5422.12s:  And cause a you know
5424.28s:  Wherever it was an eight sigma event and the mathematicians who went back and used those
5430.20s:  Normalized distribution bell curve
5432.92s:  Brownian motion models
5434.76s:  They found that the chance of black monday happening using those models was one in 10 to the one 60th
5442.84s:  Now there are 10 to the to the 80th atoms in the universe
5447.24s:  So 10 to the one 60th is a number that's so astronomically high
5452.28s:  It's not even possible. So that's why no one had had had hedge for it
5455.96s:  No one thought that a 22% decline in the sp wife would happen on a monday
5459.48s:  They said that's impossible mathematically, but it was
5462.84s:  So just literally the
5465.96s:  Yeah, just another admin note on that like the stuff like efficient market hypothesis is a framework for thinking right
5472.84s:  It's like institutions aren't actually building models off of that they they know better
5476.52s:  It's the same thing with like black sholes and option pricing
5479.56s:  If we look at option pricing black sholes martin model assumes
5483.56s:  Valtilities uniform across austrikes. We know that's not true. So and so forth
5487.24s:  It provides like a framework
5489.40s:  But anybody that's interacting with markets at a professional level. They're not gonna actually
5494.60s:  Build models off the framework now to your point
5497.48s:  They were still completely off sides for that move for sure no doubt and I completely agree with you there
5502.44s:  But well post that they talk about this in the book but post
5506.28s:  That's when people started to doubt the e-mh and serious concerns were raised about this and then they you know
5512.92s:  Obviously, there was that I don't know if you read the the last one of the last chapters called volatility smile
5518.20s:  Ever since 1987 they've seen a uptick in the convexity curve of volatility
5523.88s:  So it's like at the very extremes. There's for extreme movements
5527.64s:  You have to pay more than for a middle extreme movement if that makes sense
5531.96s:  So there's this there's this convexity with options or with futures or with swaps or whatever it is
5537.00s:  So it's like you might it would cost more to hedge a 20% downside move
5540.92s:  You know, then a 10% downside move even though the 10% down to move might be more probable
5545.80s:  And these exactly yeah, it's it's also a big a big reason why we see you know
5551.16s:  Valtility risk premiums or variance risk premiums
5553.80s:  You know for those that trade options you'll you'll be familiar with that term where we essentially oh
5559.40s:  We especially in the indices. This is a little more dynamic with respect to individual securities
5564.52s:  But we essentially always
5567.16s:  Overestimate implied versus realized volatility. It's literally for the same stuff
5571.24s:  Because it's like if you read tellerbs work he talks a lot about
5575.40s:  The the probabilistic outcomes of things and actually in my undergrad and grad I focused on stats just because I'm fascinated by
5583.32s:  Receiving the world that way
5584.92s:  But markets are interesting to that note that
5588.44s:  improbable events happen all the time
5591.80s:  Literally all the time and it's why we see things like fat tails kurtosis
5597.08s:  And the overall skew so like we know for a fact we're not looking at a normal distribution curve right?
5602.92s:  it's definitely
5604.20s:  Not normal distribution when we're modeling things which is always curious to me especially if you look at like gme price movements
5610.44s:  That's I modeled the price movements in gme out of curiosity and it's
5614.68s:  It's insane like how skewed it is. It's fascinating to me
5619.48s:  Yeah, but that again this goes back to the argument of static versus dynamic systems the stock
5624.52s:  As a dynamic system all the factors affect other factors and the and the the coefficient between those two factors changes
5632.20s:  Over time and it's in relationships. Yeah. Yes. It's these complex systems are impossible to model
5639.00s:  My dad is a
5641.08s:  Or he's retired now, but he was an atmospheric scientist and he worked for a time at Noah
5647.96s:  Yeah, to model
5651.56s:  Exactly and he was doing climate modeling and they were trying to predict what the first climate would be like in 20 to 30 years
5657.16s:  And he was telling me that there's literally like 50,000 variables and after after just a few years
5665.64s:  The cl- the variable the error bars and the variables grow so long as that it becomes useless to predict
5671.48s:  And this is the same reason why for example weather prediction models can only predict the weather for accurately for a week or less
5678.04s:  And you can't predict the weather out for three weeks. Why is that?
5681.72s:  Well, it's because the weather the climate is a dynamic system and all the all the factors impact other factors and the relationship between them changes constantly
5689.88s:  So it's it's literally impossible to model like mathematically we need
5693.64s:  Infinite computing power to literally yeah literally that's yeah that that's so cool
5700.36s:  What a cool job and did he travel a lot for that?
5704.52s:  Yeah, he um he did work in Chile
5708.44s:  And he also
5710.12s:  He also worked in the in the North Pole in the Arctic
5713.32s:  He did some some climate research up there and like did you bring you back like letters from Santa and shit?
5718.60s:  No, no
5720.92s:  No, but he was up there. I think in like 1994 doing
5724.60s:  doing research on ice crystals and
5727.32s:  Uh
5728.28s:  Prehistoric, you know air bubbles trapped in the ice trying to model what was the climate like back then
5734.52s:  I literally was just telling you before we actually went on the livestream. How much I like old shit
5738.44s:  So as you're talking about prehistoric ice bubbles you have no idea how I gotta talk to your dad sometime because that stuff is yeah sure sure
5745.16s:  You can do we can do we can set that up that's so fucking cool. I love that stuff
5750.44s:  um, but yeah the it's funny because chilly we
5754.36s:  I
5755.32s:  Beyond investing like in the stock market. I got into real estate over the last like decade or so
5760.76s:  So I work with a couple partners and we actually scooped up a couple skewers or it's in Chile specifically
5766.60s:  There is through like a trio mountain ranged and we just grabbed a second resort that we're gonna combine into like a
5773.88s:  A bigger joint resort, which looks really cool. You bought a whole resort
5778.20s:  Yeah, yeah, it's not just me. We have like a partnership that works in them um, but yeah
5783.80s:  Skew resources a big thing that the partnership does we do a lot of odds and ends so like we just grabbed a couple golf courses
5791.24s:  Last year that was like a first add to the portfolio never did those before. I'm even like golf
5796.68s:  But my buddy does so I was just like yeah, yeah, I'll ride with you as long as I can drive the carts like fucking blackout
5802.84s:  Drunk and be super irresponsible then I'm there for it and then we have like some general staples like
5809.16s:  apartment complexes student housing stuff like that
5812.20s:  Wow, that's really interesting
5814.44s:  Yeah, so a couple other questions from the chat because brillian says less Eric more bull so I gotta shut the fuck up
5825.72s:  Obviously, I don't give a fuck what they say, but wow, yeah, funny line nonetheless
5832.04s:  um, but this is super interesting so Jerry says why would retail
5837.40s:  Want to give the brokers market maker liquidity wouldn't retail want buyers to want what we are selling
5844.92s:  Instead of creating fake liquidity to move the stock in the direction they want it to be
5850.76s:  Did you follow that you want me to post it in our chat? Yeah, it's a lot. Don't fully it well
5854.36s:  I don't fully understand what it means, but that how would
5857.32s:  retail create liquidity on the sell side is that what he's arguing
5862.44s:  like i'm
5864.20s:  Yeah, so uh, Jerry could you could you clarify your question a little bit?
5868.84s:  Jerry says dear drs takes liquidity from financial
5873.32s:  terrorist broker market maker
5877.16s:  Yeah
5879.16s:  I love that um
5881.24s:  Yeah, I'm trying to follow the question, but
5885.00s:  Why would retail want to give the brokers market maker's liquidity wouldn't retail want buyers
5892.20s:  To want what we are selling so I assume they're talking about drs
5895.96s:  Think specifically like if they if you drs then you're reducing the ability for people to buy those and move the price
5901.72s:  I don't know if that's fully accurate. That's my best interpretation
5904.68s:  Yeah, that's i mean so that was the thesis behind the push for drs right is
5909.64s:  um, you know market makers are
5912.60s:  Dipping into shares and the dtcc is allowing them to dip into shares
5917.08s:  um at brokerage accounts so if you own
5919.48s:  um
5920.44s:  And this also became with a bunch of revelations around
5923.40s:  There's goldman and jb morgan and
5926.44s:  You know
5927.64s:  bavv
5929.16s:  All marijuana lynch all these brokers were found on multiple violations from
5934.04s:  The early to mid-2000s where they allowed
5937.16s:  um, they allowed their own traders and other institutions to dip into
5941.96s:  The personal accounts of their clients and even if they were cash accounts which are technically not supposed to allow
5949.96s:  um, you know
5951.88s:  Stock lending right so this this problem quickly became concerned because the question was right
5958.28s:  If we're buying gmme and we're putting them in our fidelity or putting them in our you know
5962.84s:  Roth 401k managed by maryl lynch or managed by bva or whoever
5968.20s:  um
5969.16s:  Are they just turning around and
5971.48s:  Lending out our shares then not telling us and then using those shares to short are the stock that we own
5977.32s:  Right, we don't know because again, they're not supposed to but they've been caught doing this
5982.28s:  Many many times and again, I would point you to the house of cards dd by out of it
5987.16s:  He lists out like a lot of the infractions that these companies have done
5991.56s:  Um, and then there's I think there's another one he has that that specifically goes into this this problem, but um
5998.76s:  Yeah, so with that concern people started postulating that drs was a way to
6004.04s:  remove the shares from
6006.44s:  The brokers or from the intermediary right if it's fidelity or if it's bva or maryl
6012.68s:  and
6013.56s:  Take them back into your own custody so transfer them to a transfer agent have it registered in your name and not be able to be lent out and so that's what we've been
6022.36s:  What the push has been for last what three years now and that one point did the arrest 25% of the float
6029.16s:  Which was significant and and from what I've seen a lot of the liquidity indicators on gm
6033.48s:  Have fallen quite a bit like trading volume everything so it has had an impact
6038.36s:  Um now the question is can we get to 100%
6042.20s:  That remains to be seen right is there enough buying power and staying power to get all the way to 100%
6047.00s:  We don't know and then eat and even then if we do like what will happen
6051.48s:  We don't know because no one's ever drs to 100% of float as far as I know
6055.72s:  Right well, there's also yeah because I was I was trying to follow that metric too out of curiosity
6060.92s:  But what do you think of the the role of the at the markets because it didn't look like
6067.24s:  It won it didn't look like they those drops were like being heavily bought
6072.76s:  But I can't tell like I don't know like what the retail slash broader ape sentiment is right now
6079.56s:  Specifically with respect to not whether or not it's good or bad don't care about that
6083.40s:  But more so like accumulating those shares is that still the idea or is it after those at the markets? It's kind of like
6091.16s:  Difficult to get back to where they were
6094.52s:  Um, I think it's the community is all over the place honestly some people are
6099.96s:  For and I've seen some people are
6101.96s:  Just holding what they have and they're just like I'm waiting for the squeeze and Ryan Cohen's built up 4.6 billion dollars
6107.16s:  I'm excited to see what he's gonna do other people
6110.60s:  Which are understandably other people are mad about delusion and they don't want it to happen
6114.20s:  They say look even though you diluted obviously at high prices and and profited from this
6119.96s:  We still don't like it. We don't want you to do it at all
6123.08s:  And then there's a third group that psych doesn't give a fuck and they're just buying every
6127.48s:  Every two weeks in DRSing with their paycheck. So I see I think I think people are all over the place
6134.28s:  Yeah, interesting
6137.48s:  Willie has a question for you willie says
6141.96s:  You're take on price stabilizing at the 20 handle after two at the markets
6150.28s:  I mean, I think that that's
6152.28s:  It's indicative of probably where the the new floor is for the stock
6157.88s:  So with 4.6 billion dollars of cash, you know, the hard floor
6163.48s:  Which is cash per like their cash on hand per shares like I think $10 and 74 cents now
6168.84s:  So that's like a very hard floor where literally they could buy back
6173.32s:  They they themselves could buy back all their shares with the cash they have on hand at that level
6178.36s:  um
6179.40s:  But the obviously the delta between that the cash level the cash value of all the shares and the current market price is probably where the enterprise value of the company comes in
6190.36s:  So um, you know those two combined probably are putting this $20 hard cap on the on the
6196.36s:  um
6198.36s:  On the price and like like we said earlier right like
6202.68s:  To say that infert that market makers have infinite powers incorrect and I again, I'm just saying that
6207.88s:  This idea of infinite liquidity is or maximum liquidity is is faulty
6212.20s:  But it's absolutely true that they don't have infinite power
6215.16s:  I mean or else no stock that they that they ever wanted to not rise would never rise right so if they had that much power
6222.20s:  So they clearly do have to follow market
6224.52s:  Market structure market demands if there's excess of buyers they have to sell
6228.44s:  It's just that they have a lot of wiggle room that they can move in and they've a lot of things they can do
6233.00s:  um
6234.04s:  But this could also be indicative of market makers reaching the end of the rope and being able to
6239.08s:  If they are complicit in driving the price down continually or if other entities are doing it
6243.88s:  You know, they could be running down on their ability to do it
6246.84s:  Right because again fundamental factors do matter Ryan Cohen buying 12% of the float in august 2020 and then changing the board and re
6256.52s:  You know reimagining the the the business plan caused the stock price to rocket from $5 to 400
6263.24s:  So um
6264.92s:  Yeah, clearly there's there's fundamental factors here that can affect price so this can be one of them
6269.72s:  I think $20 yeah probably be the hard hard floor for it for a while
6274.36s:  Interesting. Yeah, because one of the things I I took
6278.12s:  Pretty strong note of is when the at the markets were going we didn't like collapse down
6283.16s:  Right, so that I think is very
6286.68s:  Essentially confirmatory of your point where it seems like we we start finding wherever the the current
6293.40s:  Because what was the latest I forgot um somebody from the chat will probably know like what the what the latest cash value was
6300.44s:  I haven't I don't remember cash value is 4.6 billion
6304.36s:  No per share I said I think it's around 1074 was I think got it sorry
6310.52s:  Yeah, I got $10.74. Yeah, okay got it
6314.04s:  Yeah, because the cool part there I think is it starts to also show how people are starting to value the intellectual property the branding
6322.12s:  Of the business so because if the if the floor does start coming in around there. That's pretty powerful
6328.12s:  Um cool. I will ask one or two more and then I'll get you out of here
6331.96s:  I don't want to keep you on forever, but obviously absolute blast chat with you, man
6336.20s:  It's it's really helpful for me from a learning perspective to pick up just more and more of the story
6341.88s:  Plus I'm just fascinated by it. So really appreciate it for sure
6346.92s:  So our friend Vladimir off Putin
6350.68s:  Not to be confused with Vladimir on Putin if Vladimir might have been on put I don't know maybe
6357.08s:  I don't think Vladimir
6358.92s:  The vampire was gay he might have been and that would put him on Putin. I'm not sure
6364.12s:  but um
6366.12s:  Share price was $10 in April
6368.84s:  Ryan Cohen's basis is 261 on almost 37 million shares
6374.52s:  coincidence don't forget about BBBY
6379.24s:  I don't know the
6382.36s:  share price was 10 and
6384.92s:  Okay, sorry, why is that a coincidence? I don't understand the connection between his average share price and the stock price
6393.80s:  Yeah, same
6395.80s:  So off Putin if you have a follow on to that um, let me know I'd love to uh I'd love to get further
6403.24s:  Oh, he's saying he has an escape hatch
6405.96s:  Oh in terms of I see he's just saying essentially that he's on a good basis that makes sense. Yeah
6412.12s:  He is on a good basis for sure
6414.28s:  So Captain Chris says do you think swaps expiry is heavily correlated to spikes
6421.32s:  It can be again, so here's the issue with swaps and this is what I if you go back on my youtube channel
6428.76s:  Search proving bull um, I did a long-form video like a 30-minute video on the swaps and I explained this in that video
6435.24s:  Like look we have some dead on the swaps the issue is and some of them were like huge rollovers, right? We're talking you know
6443.80s:  Hundreds of millions of dollars billions of dollars for some of them
6447.64s:  In total
6448.76s:  But the issue is that's the size of the the the no-sino size of the swap how much of that is hedged and how much of a is unhatched
6455.96s:  You don't know right whoever the counterparty is so like let's say it this swap was archa-ghosts and credit sues and that credit sues now passed off to ubs
6464.84s:  So ubs if they have a swap open for
6468.12s:  5 million shares of gme if they already have three million shares somewhere
6473.24s:  Then a lot of their exposures hedge and they don't have to worry about the rest of it
6477.72s:  Or if they're able to hedge it through options or or another swap
6480.92s:  What if they open up a swap with another kind of party that hedges you know passes this hot potato
6486.12s:  So this is the issue with this what we talked about in earlier the opacity of the market is you don't know
6492.36s:  You know the exact details of the swap we don't know how much is hedged we don't know exactly who the counterparty's are even in even in the
6499.88s:  In the data sheet that I
6501.88s:  Linked in that youtube video. I think I linked it
6504.12s:  But I discuss it you don't you obviously don't see the counterparty so it doesn't say you know
6509.48s:  counterparty one nomura counterparty two archa-ghosts
6512.60s:  Doesn't say that it just says here's the swap like you know this
6518.12s:  200 million you know basket swap entered at this time edited at this time
6524.44s:  You know and here's like five takes sometimes they say here are five takers that were in the basket and sometimes they don't even say that
6530.76s:  So you don't even know
6532.36s:  So that's the that's the issue like I would say
6535.72s:  Look you can try to trade off the swap data, but I
6539.32s:  It's not a guarantee
6541.08s:  Because if it was I'd be a much richer man than I am right now and I'd be living in mansion
6546.68s:  But I have seen I've seen massive swap role of the day, so I'm sure you have to I've seen massive ones happen and the stock price
6553.24s:  Not really move like maybe it jumps exactly three or four percent
6557.40s:  I think yeah exactly because I ran there was so many in my community that was piecing together the swaps and they grabbed like a whole list of them
6565.40s:  And this is also what I was working on with Newton with
6567.96s:  um
6568.76s:  And I looked at a correlation between all of them the problem is when we look at a lot of the relationships
6574.76s:  We tend to focus on the ones that align with what we're trying to see so for example if we want to see or think there is
6582.60s:  A relationship between swap expiration and then stock price movement we are mine naturally claims on those instances
6589.64s:  But when we look across like the broad breath
6592.36s:  Just completely looking at all the swap
6594.52s:  Explorations and the follow week price performance. It's not super indicative now the follow on question
6600.52s:  I would have for you there though that I'm really interested in because I haven't found a good source for me to test
6608.36s:  And I'm trying to find something is in terms of um
6613.32s:  uh correlated correlation
6616.12s:  So is there any other factor that you're aware of with if big swap comes up and other factor
6624.84s:  We think there is a strong relationship with price moving so I've tried it with FTDs
6631.24s:  And it was inconclusive in terms of like the relationship and I'm wondering if there's anything else that I don't know of that I could test
6638.36s:  Uh, have you looked at ETF FTDs specifically?
6642.52s:  Okay, because I was gonna say that's the one that I found was the strongest
6647.32s:  ECF FTDs, but the problem is
6649.88s:  Obviously with the lag reporting in data like exactly. It's a it's a backwards looking thing
6655.80s:  Again, if if if I was able to find tip accurately predict GME which I would argue is probably the hardest stock to predict in the world
6663.48s:  um
6664.44s:  If I was able to accurately predict it
6666.76s:  And I would I would be a multi multi-millionaire because I would be killing it
6671.48s:  And I would probably be able to find the same thing true for every other stock. So unfortunately no
6676.52s:  um, I would say
6678.68s:  You know the best
6681.08s:  Well what I found is GME trades really strangely around major events
6686.20s:  So usually before earnings the stock price will grind lower for a few weeks and then it will pop up
6692.92s:  Up until earnings and then it'll be slammed down after earnings and
6697.24s:  Get you know be in the dumps for a few weeks
6700.60s:  so
6701.80s:  Do this is no guarantee but like from the data I looked at it was a pretty common occurrence for the stock
6708.36s:  Stock price to fall so if you want to go long before sell it before earnings
6713.48s:  Buy in a week later after earnings after the stock price is tanked that could be one strategy
6717.64s:  But again, it's no guarantee because there's also been earnings where not much has happened
6721.80s:  So we just don't know
6724.52s:  Yeah, for earnings I have a
6727.64s:  Data set actually that I can
6730.28s:  Talk about it super fast that'll look through the last
6734.60s:  Um, if you use think or swim you can actually look at I think they show you the last eight
6740.20s:  And the price performance leading into and then post earnings, but there's another data set that I have that goes back
6746.60s:  um a lot further
6749.40s:  but the
6751.16s:  one of the main things
6753.40s:  I think for
6754.92s:  GameStop specifically that I can
6758.12s:  Accurately point to literally every single time before it has a big movement
6763.40s:  And it's not always positively predictive of big movement
6767.24s:  But I've seen it and it's the only thing I've ever seen uniform across every single big move
6772.36s:  Is a volume expansion before the big move it typically starts a few days out that you can see it
6777.48s:  Um, and it's a multiple of proceeding volume. It's not like double. It's typically triple plus
6784.84s:  So yeah, and there will be instances again for everybody
6787.96s:  It's not like this magic cheat code because there will be instances that volume will triple plus and then
6792.60s:  Price doesn't move
6793.88s:  But it's one of the the few things that I found a very strong correlation with in terms with respect to price movement
6800.36s:  Have you talked to six days about um a heat lamp theory?
6805.40s:  Uh, I don't know who that is
6808.12s:  Okay, this is another interesting rabbit hole you could start pulling down um six days one week he wrote uh
6815.64s:  A really great dd called heat lamp um back in 2022
6820.60s:  And he's expanded on the theory and added to it quite a bit um
6824.52s:  But another thing is he noticed around dr s record dates massive jumps in volume
6830.44s:  Like we're talking the average of volume traded going from five million to 60 or 70 million in a day
6836.36s:  And then falling back down to five million a few days later
6839.96s:  Interesting right around a dr s record date which is like indicative of
6845.32s:  Something going on with the ball and not not all these obviously were
6850.20s:  Were coincident with price increases like the price might have stayed the same
6853.56s:  But the someone was furiously trading gme shares in the background
6858.20s:  To cause 60 million share volume in a day um and and then the price just doesn't move and then dr s record date passes and
6867.24s:  Somehow dr s numbers don't move. So it's there's a lot of uh
6872.68s:  Weird shit going on with the stock. Let's just say that
6875.88s:  Yeah, dude, I'll have to I'll have to take a look at that if
6879.96s:  um
6881.24s:  I'll shoot you a message or something to see if you can send me a link to it. I'd love to read through it
6885.64s:  um
6886.36s:  Cool, well, I guess the the last thing I'll hit you with before you wrap then is just
6890.68s:  Looking at game stop now
6893.56s:  What do you think about it going forward? I know it's a big question, but I
6898.04s:  I get really engaged by all the different theories in terms of how
6902.20s:  Game stop might use the money and I find a lot of that just very very interesting. So
6907.08s:  Super super interested in your thoughts on that. Sure. Yeah. No, I so going back to that
6913.56s:  That earlier tinfoil right there's a couple different theories of what what they could be doing
6917.64s:  They could be just going you know
6920.12s:  They could be trying to reinvigorate all their and rehabilitate all their stores
6924.60s:  And or they could be trying to build out a totally new online platform all those 4.6 billion
6930.84s:  That doesn't point to just uh
6933.40s:  An internal um, you know
6935.56s:  Optimization of their systems or whatever it points to acquisition
6939.88s:  So likely I think they're going to acquire someone and acquire someone large now
6944.84s:  Question is who and the BBB why people will tell you they're gonna that rank going to come in and buy BBB. Why out of bankruptcy
6953.00s:  Other people will tell you that
6955.80s:  Why do you think that?
6956.76s:  Because rank like I said earlier rank coins listed as a creditor um
6962.04s:  On on the BBB why
6964.92s:  Cap table um, there's also correspondence between him and I think
6969.80s:  Some judge ruling in the case
6972.28s:  Like there's um
6974.92s:  Yeah, I think you'd have to ask them again. I don't follow the BBB why crowd that deeply because it's not just on the stock I trade but um
6983.16s:  There's some people who think it's that some and I think the more likely is that
6988.04s:  Game shop would want to acquire someone that's in a similar category to them and just expand
6994.12s:  Right um and just continue to fall down this path of re revitalizing retail brick and mortar
7001.08s:  So I think this is likely likely option
7003.48s:  But right now with 4.6 billion in cash and making 5% of that
7008.68s:  They're sitting pretty so they don't need you know
7012.84s:  They're fine. I mean, they're also profitable right and
7016.20s:  Their store footprints down by 22% their sqna expensive down by like 29% and they uh
7024.12s:  Yeah, even though the revenue has fallen um overall they're much healthier business than they were three years ago
7030.28s:  So I think rank one is then a good job of turning around the internal fundamentals of changing the
7036.68s:  The functioning of the business to actually be effective and profitable and he's been working on now
7043.48s:  What are the next steps to do with his cash and whatever you do with it you have to make sure like all the
7048.68s:  You know eyes have to be dotted the teeth have to be crossed because
7052.28s:  You don't want to mess up an acquisition like this. This might be a one shot at
7057.32s:  A valid acquisition that can help a rocket you out of this um
7061.64s:  You know kind of stagged the quagmire that he's in
7065.00s:  Yeah, not to say that it's like he's not in a position where
7069.16s:  Things are going downhill, but it's like now. Okay. He stopped the bleeding
7073.08s:  Game shops no longer losing money. They've eliminated a lot of their stores. They've cleaned up
7078.52s:  You know, they're act they've they've eliminated a lot of the old board for example
7083.72s:  Now the question is how do they really make turn this into a revolutionary company which is you know potentially could could compete with Amazon
7092.60s:  So we'll have to wait and see what he does I I don't I don't have a solid answer for you on on what I think he's gonna do
7099.64s:  Yeah, um last clarifying question on that though do you have any thoughts on kind of a timeline that you would expect to see movement
7108.84s:  I would say I mean just
7111.56s:  Personally within you know six to nine months. I mean usually if you get this level of cash
7118.04s:  You wouldn't sit on it for more than a year. That's what I would assume
7121.96s:  Literally exactly my thought from a general perspective
7124.68s:  But I didn't know if there was any specific nuances with game stop because I know I find it interesting a lot of people are like
7130.68s:  Oh like they're making you know interest on their money and like it's good to make interest
7135.08s:  But it's you don't raise that money to make interest you raise it to do something
7139.88s:  Yeah, exactly so no they're gonna have to yeah they have to figure out what they're doing
7144.92s:  So or they probably already know but they're just not telegraphing it obviously they don't want it
7150.04s:  It's a bad business practice um
7152.92s:  But yeah, I think I think uh
7155.24s:  In within the next six to nine months we should get a clear answer on what they're actually gonna do with all this cash because
7160.52s:  You know sitting on this for forever doesn't really make sense
7162.84s:  I have seen other companies raise money and hold it for six months or a year
7168.28s:  But I've never heard of a company raising this level of money and holding it for like two three four years and just never doing anything with it
7174.84s:  Yeah, yeah
7176.84s:  Yeah, that's the way to see
7178.84s:  We will
7180.60s:  Dude
7181.80s:  Super super interesting. Thank you so much for coming to hang out for a little bit sharing what you know
7187.32s:  Before we wrap obviously you're on YouTube at
7190.28s:  Ruvian bull um people can find you on twitter. It's the same handle
7194.44s:  Yes, yeah, Peruvian underscore bull and look for the one with the verified trademark or the verified blue blue checkmark
7201.40s:  Because I have a lot of clones that we'll try to
7203.56s:  They might try to get to join some telegram group or some discord like I don't I don't have any of that
7208.92s:  All I have is the web I've website a substack a YouTube
7213.40s:  And then my twitter
7215.00s:  So beautiful
7215.96s:  Yeah, and I'll grab the links to you and then I'll throw them in the video notes so that people can find it pretty easily
7220.52s:  But dude thanks for hanging out. Well definitely have to do it again. It'd be fun to take a look
7224.60s:  I'm in the process of finishing going through all of rowing kiddie's old trades
7229.24s:  I think we're on like part five of the series so his Reddit profile we went down to the bottom and I essentially tracking the
7236.92s:  differences
7238.12s:  Between the trades and the way that he's trading them which has been fascinating
7241.72s:  So once I get that under my belt and I have a slightly better understanding of him
7245.64s:  I'd actually love to tap into your understanding of him
7248.92s:  Just as an actor because he reminds me of like the the Joker from Batman
7253.16s:  You like really don't know what the dude's gonna fucking do and it's hilarious
7257.08s:  Yeah, that's why this whole thing has been like like I said
7259.96s:  It's it's something that's like a meme. It's like a glitch in the matrix. It breaks again
7264.52s:  It breaks all the traditional financial dogma right you should sell your winners when you're up
7269.56s:  When you make 40 million dollars in a week like rowing kiddie made in the first week of 2021
7273.64s:  You should sell and then he's just like no, I'm not selling you have to stop or anything. Yeah, no, no
7279.40s:  He's just like what's an exit strategy and then he comes back in May of 2024
7285.00s:  Three and a half years later and somehow he has fucking like 200 million dollars. It's like what the how did he
7293.64s:  Where did he come up with all this money like what has he been doing and he'd no answer?
7297.40s:  He's just like oh by the way, I bought
7300.20s:  You know, I bought five percent the float of GME in options
7303.96s:  expiring for next month like let's go
7307.96s:  Yeah, the absolutely classic. Yeah, it's it's been
7311.72s:  Understanding his movements has been really really interesting except first
7314.92s:  I thought maybe the value investor normal to have like price targets
7319.64s:  Clearly not that then the way that he even manages his options trades
7323.32s:  I found that to be really interesting that he sometimes would sell
7326.92s:  He's in the money options and hold the out of the money options
7330.52s:  Which I also find that super interesting. It's like a series of just
7333.88s:  Questions and I'm just like I don't fucking know what's happening. It's epic
7338.44s:  Yeah, it is epic. It's probably the best you know story and finance in the last two decades at least if not more
7344.60s:  Couldn't agree more. Yeah, definitely the most interesting. So thanks for sharing your information with me, man
7350.04s:  And we'll definitely reach back out and look to chat with you again. Yeah, for sure. Let's this again
7355.24s:  This is really fun. Thanks for having me. Yeah, awesome. See you everybody
