0.60s: what's up outliers today we're going to
2.52s: talk about rolling short HS in levered
8.12s: ETFs right now I'm trading the covered
11.24s: strangle on a few different tickers two
14.72s: of which are levered one of them is SSO
18.32s: this is a two times S&P 500 Index ETF
24.08s: and then there's tle Q This is a three
27.56s: times leveraged NASDAQ QQQ ETF now the
32.56s: reason why I trade these I have an
34.00s: entire video that talks about trading
35.60s: the coverage triangle on leveraged
38.84s: products uh significant reason is
41.04s: because of the volatility premium that
44.04s: gets priced into them and a big element
47.64s: of the cover triangle is the short legs
52.20s: that are part of it which I'll show you
55.48s: really quick here before we get into the
57.24s: roles themselves if we take a look at
60.16s: let's say the coverage strangle here
61.68s: that we're going to be talking about in
63.68s: tle Qs this is the position as it sits
66.96s: today so you'll see that right now this
69.64s: is all part of a model portfolio I've
72.48s: kind of taken my main portfolio and
74.60s: broken out a couple chunks to trade the
77.48s: coverage strangle in a couple different
79.68s: sizes that are more relevant to kind of
82.44s: just general people building out their
84.36s: accounts and so right now the coverage
87.64s: strangle on tle Q's is
90.44s: combined with 500 shares so there's an
94.24s: equity position then there are two Tres
97.72s: of short puts this is obviously a short
101.16s: put position and then there's the short
103.72s: call element now today I'm going to be
106.72s: focusing on the rolling of the short
109.28s: puts and that's because especially in
112.08s: something like in leveraged ETF it is a
115.04s: delicate balance why is it a delicate
117.60s: balance well this is why because if if
119.96s: you take a look at the overall price
122.08s: performance of something like QQQ and we
124.76s: Zoom this out let's do a three-year
126.68s: daily you'll notice that it goes through
129.36s: different periods where it can have
130.92s: these very broad nasty turn Downs in
135.24s: this case this represents a 34% decline
138.44s: if we look here this is a 41% decline
141.12s: this one is
142.44s: 232 this one is
146.04s: 32.8 this one's 35 it looks smaller
149.08s: because of the scale but it's not it's a
150.76s: 35% drop this is 58 this total drop here
155.12s: from Peak to tr um this one here is
160.56s: 64 this move here like this total move
164.08s: is massive we take a look at that total
166.84s: move it's
168.80s: 73.6% so the broader content here is
172.72s: that the tickers like this move a lot
177.44s: and the way that we choose to manage our
179.84s: our positions around them is essential
183.72s: to the success of the strategy one of
185.48s: the primary ways that the coverage
186.92s: strangle performs so well is because as
191.00s: the market is going down I use the
193.60s: strategy to turn a profit of the option
196.60s: side of the equation and then when it
198.88s: begins to Rally during this period I'm
200.96s: dollar cost averaging into it very
203.32s: carefully and then as it rallies up and
206.16s: out I have a really great basis that
208.68s: takes advantage of the event ual
210.44s: recovery so the broader context here is
213.52s: the management of the short puts is
215.56s: literally essential so one of the things
218.44s: that I want to direct your attention to
221.08s: are creating the objectives for the role
224.00s: what are we trying to do and there's
225.92s: typically two broad buckets that I think
228.36s: about the first bucket is maximizing
231.76s: profit potential the second bucket is
235.00s: maximizing basis reduction now as it
238.80s: pertains to the strategy that we're
240.28s: talking about here I am focusing on
242.48s: basis reduction why well it is for this
247.00s: context that I was actually showing you
249.56s: a little bit earlier it's because if we
252.04s: take a look at the frequency of various
254.28s: size moves in both SSO and tle Qs you
257.72s: can see that on a monthly time frame
260.08s: they can have pretty significant moves
262.84s: greater than 40% is not supremely
266.84s: infrequent it's infrequent but not
268.72s: supremely infrequent so because of that
273.00s: the way that I apply the mental model to
275.36s: these short puts that we're going over
277.36s: now is very much from the context of how
281.72s: can I continually reduce the basis of
286.20s: the options so that I can be in a better
289.16s: and better spot to take advantage during
291.52s: the eventual recovery so let's take a
293.60s: look at an example here in tle Q's so on
296.36s: tle Q's you can see on the 12th of Feb I
299.92s: had sold five of the 78 strike puts
305.32s: expiring again 21 March for 293 so let's
308.80s: go to 12 Feb and let's see what this
311.80s: looked like when I entered it so 12 Feb
315.20s: is right here this is in the face almost
319.28s: top ticked it real good at that this is
322.08s: in the face of a pretty significant
323.52s: decline so if we take a look at what the
326.28s: underlying has done since I got in it
328.96s: rallied up and then it is essentially
330.96s: just gone straight down so what is the
334.08s: state of these puts well I had to take
336.48s: them down I took them down for
339.32s: $10.25 on the 4th of March so let's take
343.08s: a look at the 4th of March and let's see
345.92s: what happened then so again this is the
347.76s: entry point here and then the 4th of
350.40s: March is right here so the reason why
355.56s: they needed to be adjusted on the 4th of
357.28s: March is because I was running out of x
358.88s: trenic value the risk of early
360.96s: assignment was starting to grow so
364.36s: that's why I took them down and again
366.56s: what I told you I took them down for was
369.32s: that
370.84s: $10
372.40s: and
374.32s: 25 so now what's the next step well
378.36s: again going back to the first objective
380.64s: the stock has gone down 24.1% since I
383.64s: got in my objective here is to reduce
387.20s: the basis to try to manage my basis as
389.40s: best as I can and I committed one of the
393.16s: big mistakes that you're not supposed to
394.92s: do with options but this is typically by
397.12s: people who don't understand them and I
399.08s: actually rolled it for a debit that
402.04s: means that I closed this option for
404.72s: $10.25 and then I opened a new one for
407.72s: $9.80 why would I do that well it's
410.56s: because net net this is still a premium
415.56s: meaning I'm still collecting a credit if
418.24s: we take a look at the series of
419.64s: transactions here I took in
421.64s: 1465 I then closed out for
424.36s: 5125 and then I opened up the new ones
426.84s: for 4900 so that still Nets me out in a
430.84s: positive position and the big thing that
433.32s: was accomplished here was adjusting the
435.72s: strike nearly
437.96s: 4% I took my bases from 78 down to 75 so
443.56s: not only does this reduce the base bases
446.96s: pretty massively but it also position me
449.88s: to be able to take on a larger position
452.60s: because the covered strangle requirement
455.48s: has gone from 39,000 now to
458.48s: $37,500 I can afford more of the
462.72s: underlying the reason why that matters
465.32s: is going back to the original example of
468.24s: being able to effectively dollar cost
470.84s: average in to the underlying in this
474.48s: case tle Q's as it goes down if we take
477.72s: a look at some rough math that I just
479.96s: sketched in here the difference of these
482.56s: two is that 1,500 bucks with tle q's
485.48s: currently trading at 61.89 that
487.60s: literally represents an additional 24
489.64s: shares that can be purchased at spot
491.92s: price through this reduction so that is
495.12s: one of the big things I'm paying
496.48s: attention to notice how I did not add
499.00s: any size here why did I not add size
502.00s: because we are still potentially in the
504.88s: very early stages of a decline do I
507.44s: think tle Q's is going to have another
509.68s: 82% decline right now I personally don't
513.08s: but just because I don't think that's
515.16s: what's going to happen doesn't mean that
516.28s: it can't happen or something worse so
519.28s: what I'm doing is I'm thinking very
521.24s: carefully not just about what is
523.80s: happening right now but then what can
526.44s: happen with the position as we go
528.20s: further out in time and this is why I am
530.96s: so aggressively attempting to manage
533.24s: basis because what eventually happens is
536.64s: if this strike becomes too buried
539.44s: meaning too far in the money and the
541.96s: underlying continues to go down it
543.72s: becomes next to impossible to continue
545.80s: rolling it out for a credit or even
549.00s: something that still yields a profitable
551.24s: position post roll so then that means
553.52s: you either have to choose to take
554.84s: assignment but if your basis is too high
557.76s: then it really doesn't help improve your
559.48s: position much so then you're just tying
561.92s: up money in something that's not moving
564.12s: so my goal is to be aggressive UPF front
566.88s: this does come at the cost of total
568.84s: profitability but right now I am heavily
572.24s: prioritizing the basis adjustment
575.08s: element of this trade so that's the game
578.20s: plan as it sits this is one of the main
581.68s: Concepts that goes into rolling short
585.12s: puts with respect to leveraged products
588.20s: is having a tight game plan on how we
591.80s: intend to manage it by understanding the
594.80s: actual flow of Premium as it pertains to
597.60s: the position and I have another video
599.04s: that talks about rolling options in
601.04s: detail I will absolutely share a link to
604.76s: that in the notes below and as always if
607.20s: you have any questions let me know be an
609.48s: outlier see youall later
