0.68s: happy Friday everybody it's the 5th of
2.52s: July and I want to talk through the
5.44s: expiration cycle for today a lot of
8.32s: options came off we can see a lot went
11.64s: back out over
15.00s: 239,000 calls transacted today which is
17.96s: a heavy number compared to what we saw
20.56s: back on the 3rd of June which it was
23.12s: actually starting to slow down for a
24.48s: couple days and we definitely
26.60s: accelerated back up today being over
28.52s: 200,000 calls again we did see puts also
32.40s: expand we have
34.20s: 75,000 puts traded today heavy heavy
39.20s: heavy call skew no doubt about it in
41.84s: terms of transactions now if we take a
44.12s: look at where the majority of these
46.36s: transactions occurred in calls notice
50.04s: 37% of the transaction today were at the
54.24s: bid or below these are sales these are
56.16s: people selling calls then the 29 those
59.24s: are people buying calls if we look on
61.40s: the put side most people came in slight
64.80s: Edge by one point over the bid where 32%
68.68s: came in at the offer so there's people
70.56s: buying puts so this is expectation of
73.16s: downside by a very slight Edge and then
76.56s: this is not necessarily expectation of
78.40s: downside this can be covered calls but
81.28s: that still would benefit from a slight
83.52s: down move on the options perspective
85.72s: obviously if you sell a covered call you
87.84s: still want the underlying to go up
90.00s: that's where Max profit in the trade
92.20s: lies so let's take a look at what's
95.68s: going on here quick recap of the week
99.48s: now when we see what open interest is
102.04s: about to fall out of these before today
105.48s: well before today's uh the volume is
108.12s: integrated into this I should say we had
110.52s: 894 th000 calls against
113.68s: 526k puts now if we go into this
116.92s: expiration the 5 July we're going to
118.44s: lose almost 200 ,000 calls they're going
121.08s: to expire they're going to be gone and
123.04s: then on the put side we're going to lose
125.08s: 84,000 so what's going to happen here is
129.56s: this essentially
132.12s: 900,000 calls is going to drop almost by
134.92s: 200k so there's still going to be really
138.88s: heavy call oi skew but we're starting to
143.08s: move out obviously into the next Cycles
145.72s: 12 July which I know right now has been
148.80s: sent into to me a few times s that
150.36s: that's apparently an expiration cycle to
152.12s: look out for based on the t35 cycle and
156.32s: it looks really quiet from an options
158.16s: perspective so far we see 79,000 calls
161.60s: versus 40,000 puts small very small now
167.16s: the reason why this matters is I I've
168.96s: told you guys this a lot now but it's
170.52s: important to reiterate these
172.56s: non-standard expirations the weeklys
174.64s: especially in smaller products like
176.60s: GameStop are going to be slower and it's
179.84s: because of liquidity markets look for
181.88s: liquidity so if we go out to the 19th
184.16s: July I will bet you these will be much
185.96s: higher and they are these are at
189.12s: 256 Triple 6 uhoh there's that number
192.20s: again I guess it's quad 6 so it doesn't
194.48s: really count H there goes that no need
197.44s: to do any uh burning sage around here I
199.64s: suppose so we have
201.88s: 256,000 calls versus
204.96s: 141k on the put side in 19 July we got
208.96s: to 26 lie it's 455 to 15 two OG 15 to5
215.32s: nine OG is 1,900 to 500 super quiet and
219.56s: nine OG and then 16 ogs the next one I
221.48s: really wanted to look at was 124 to 71
224.32s: so we are maintaining call skew still
227.72s: this is important to keep a close eye on
229.52s: because it's very telling in terms of
232.00s: how people are
233.44s: positioning going into the future which
236.24s: is a big part of what we're trying to
238.32s: monitor here because if we look at
239.84s: GameStop and if we zoom in let's do like
241.88s: a 3-month daily we have been sideways
244.84s: for almost in whoa wrong thing we've
248.08s: been sideways for a really long period
250.44s: of time here so if we take kind of from
252.92s: there to there it's really hard to see
255.88s: just because there's such Distortion
258.88s: here I'm not using a log chart but this
260.80s: will help a little bit you can see that
263.08s: like we're essentially hovering 27 to 23
266.44s: it's just bouncing in between there
268.04s: slight decline through there again I
270.44s: really don't believe much of
272.64s: standardized technical analysis with
274.80s: products like this because of how unique
276.40s: it is but it is good to look at all the
279.32s: moving averages are super compressed I
282.56s: have a bunch of different moving
283.60s: averages there's like a 7 14 21 50 200 I
288.08s: essentially do a a visual Max macd I
290.68s: don't use the oscillator I can just see
292.76s: it here track the widths but they're
294.72s: also compressed they essentially look
296.16s: like one line just heavy consolidation
298.92s: supremely heavy
300.64s: consolidation going back now to the
302.84s: options though what does this mean going
305.52s: forward well it means a few things the
308.48s: very first thing is we need to pay
310.88s: pretty close attention to where we're
313.16s: starting to see volume flowing in so we
315.52s: can see that there's a lot of volume
316.80s: today this is probably people trying to
319.20s: get out of positions and collect a few
321.12s: pennies to save what money they can
323.40s: notice all these blue dots those are for
325.36s: today's expiration so if we kill
327.68s: that and we look at the next series of
330.44s: interesting expirations now the blue
332.24s: dots are 12 July and that's kind of
334.96s: people are just moving out one week
338.32s: that's what we're seeing everybody's
339.60s: trying to maintain as much sensitivity
341.24s: to the front expiration cycle because
343.08s: that's where the perception is of these
345.20s: really big moves happening which right
348.68s: now it's generally quiet implied
352.16s: volatility is high but it's low on a
356.32s: relative basis so what that means is if
358.16s: we take a look up here and we take a
360.12s: look at the IV by itself it's at 127 the
364.76s: IV rank is all the way down at 23 and
367.28s: then the IV percentile is up at 73 if
369.32s: you're unfamiliar with IV rank versus
371.44s: percentile IV percentile is less prone
374.72s: to skew whereas IV rank is very prone to
378.56s: skew that's actually why IV rank looks
380.80s: so low compared to IV percentile but for
384.36s: something like GameStop implied
386.68s: volatility can fly off the handle any
388.60s: second so even though IV percentile
392.12s: still showing elevated here I think it's
394.72s: because if we look back over the past
396.64s: year it had such periods of supremely
399.20s: depressed volatility so I actually think
401.16s: a better metric is to kind of use from
403.12s: like the 3rd of May forward and
405.16s: projector volatility out of this which
407.12s: would be a little bit more
410.08s: representative of kind of this this
412.00s: near-term Paradigm that we're in with
414.64s: respect to volatility for
416.52s: GameStop so when I look at this I not
420.00s: seeing anything jumping out at me in
422.80s: terms of huge positions being built I'm
425.44s: seeing lighter volume for these at the
428.40s: monies out in 16 August I see in the 19
432.60s: July a little bit of heavier volume here
435.68s: at the 25s here again at the 30s so
439.44s: there's some standard buildout happening
442.16s: but it's not to the same degree we do
444.16s: see these super far out of the monies
446.16s: still seeing a lot of activity at the
448.36s: 125s the the thing with the 125 is again
451.24s: to remember we've had a couple
452.84s: conversations about this in the comments
455.08s: which are really really good to have I
456.96s: think there's a mix of reasons why these
459.68s: 125s go on or the really far out of the
463.24s: monies it's not unique to the 125s it
465.96s: really boils down to a cheap position
469.44s: that can do a lot of different things
470.76s: for you so some people speculate that
473.56s: the majority of this volume is coming
475.04s: from institutions and I still don't see
478.28s: that the reason reason being is because
481.64s: you can use these for kind of a locate
484.72s: synthetic the problem with that theory
488.48s: is that there's very few instances that
491.96s: those locates are going to correspond in
494.80s: less than 10 lot contracts which is the
497.16s: majority of what you see here and then
498.88s: the argument I hear kind of in retort to
501.40s: that which is a good argument is well
503.12s: couldn't they split up their orders they
504.84s: can the problem if they do that and
507.36s: you're trying to fill something that's
508.84s: worth several tens of thousands of
511.64s: shares of GameStop with respect to
513.60s: locates is this would have to
515.92s: essentially be a constant feed of less
519.92s: than 10 Lots it it would have to be all
521.60s: day in order for them to put a position
523.16s: on which also becomes detectable right
526.64s: because we can then see well wow there's
529.48s: been a lot of volume at specific strikes
531.48s: in a given day you can pick up on those
533.96s: cues and that's what this does down here
536.56s: I can say well okay there's obviously
539.64s: big activity going on and this is out in
541.68s: the 19 July at the 125s but it's still
545.48s: only
546.40s: 10,830 volume that's not insignificant
550.12s: but that's still not going to clear a
552.72s: meaningful amount of locates if somebody
555.84s: is using it for that purpose they would
557.32s: need a a much larger position so I'm not
560.72s: saying that that's not happening but I
563.08s: don't think that's the only thing that's
564.76s: happening as I look through this
566.84s: specifically when I see all of these one
568.92s: Lots two lots three Lots to me a lot of
572.96s: these instances boil down to small
575.76s: retail Traders hoping to hit it big
578.60s: these are this is the quintessential
580.84s: purchasing behavior of retail Traders
582.88s: and there's a lot of studies on ssrn on
584.92s: this exact topic that you should check
586.44s: out because there's a certain tendency
590.96s: to look for cheap Alternatives and the
593.60s: people that are going out really short
595.72s: expirations 12 July 19 July going super
598.72s: far out of the Mone
600.24s: yeah I mean they're they're paying $9
602.60s: for the option but the overwhelming
604.72s: probability there is that it is going to
606.64s: vaporize over the next couple days now
609.60s: again to steal me in that
611.76s: perspective if we do get the move in
614.44s: that time frame those cheap options are
616.92s: going to fly off the handle and they're
618.44s: going to be worth a ton of money that's
621.36s: if it's a very different style to
623.60s: approaching than my personal take and I
625.20s: will always remind you guys the way I
627.40s: look at things the way I do things is
628.80s: not the only way there's other ways to
630.56s: do this stuff but I care about creating
634.20s: success over a longterm time frame I
636.96s: this is my 17th year of trading and it's
639.88s: literally changed my life doing this
641.48s: stuff and it's very cool to see people
645.16s: that find those one-off positions that
647.00s: happen to take off into the stratosphere
648.96s: that's really fun but it's very similar
652.04s: to playing the lotto in being the winner
654.16s: of the lotto that's a tough way to
656.52s: predicate your future wealth on being
658.68s: the winner of the aotto that's why a lot
661.20s: of times when you'll see my positions on
662.96s: here and off here I go to all different
665.08s: kinds of time frames so now I'm out even
666.80s: further to the 105s and the reason why
668.84s: I'm out here is because that's where I
670.72s: found liquidity for the options that I
672.28s: wanted which were slightly in the money
673.92s: it's just a different approach and again
675.88s: not saying mine's right or wrong but the
677.64s: other thing you'll notice about where
678.72s: I'm at is volatility is quite a bit
681.64s: cheaper than some of these shorter SL
684.56s: midterm expiration Cycles but I'm
686.20s: getting a lot of Deltas by going at SL
688.52s: in the money so that if there is a big
690.60s: move yeah I have a higher deductible I'm
692.28s: paying more up front but I will actually
694.28s: see a higher gross profit so that's the
698.56s: way I'm looking at this and I am trading
700.40s: all of the small moves and when you see
702.12s: me do these different videos this will
703.48s: be here this will not be here sometimes
705.52s: I use the the dummy account to not have
707.76s: any noise on here in terms of positions
709.72s: but the point I'm trying to make here is
712.24s: that there's a lot of different ways to
713.44s: play it going super far out of the money
716.52s: is a style it's a low probability trade
720.36s: so you have to figure out what's right
722.32s: for you I am absolutely keeping a really
725.44s: close eye I actually just partnered with
727.96s: my friends over at unusual Wales which
731.52s: takes kind of that spreadsheet you've
733.24s: guys seen me do before and it makes it a
735.32s: little easier I still like being able to
737.72s: download the data to aggregate it and
739.56s: stuff like this but this does let me
741.28s: comb through specific date ranges very
743.88s: quickly to look for interesting
745.92s: positions so that part I enjoy and
749.80s: you can see essentially what I showed
751.40s: you in that platform the majority of
754.88s: volume that we're seeing are at those
757.48s: even strikes the 20 25 30s and there's
762.40s: not a lot of massive dollar value trades
765.76s: there are some but none of these are
768.96s: huge right this is a pretty big trade
771.20s: the 20s that are out in 16 of October
776.52s: that's a $100,000 position that starts
778.16s: to get a little bit interesting that's
779.60s: the kind of thing that I like to keep an
781.64s: eye on because as people are trying to
783.68s: build positions this is kind of telling
786.20s: to see this style of activity if it's
788.68s: persistent because a $100,000 position
790.88s: is big but it's also not crazy so this
794.92s: is absolutely something that I want to
797.56s: keep an eye on until you notice this
799.96s: little thing right here you see where it
801.32s: says
802.40s: multile that matters to me the reason
804.92s: why that matters to me is because if I'm
806.96s: looking for straight up position that
809.48s: are gaining direct exposure I don't want
811.72s: there to be multiple legs because
813.56s: they're looking to offset some of the
815.12s: risk of that position so I'm typically
817.20s: looking for straight buys that really
820.44s: display conviction in the direction so
823.72s: there's a little bit of support there
825.96s: for it but there's
827.60s: nothing very interesting happening yet
829.88s: that's what it boils down to I continue
831.76s: to say this to you guys all the time my
834.00s: hope is to share information as
835.76s: objectively as I can see it and let you
837.48s: guys come to your own conclusions I'm
839.32s: not trying to pump anything up and I'm
841.24s: not trying to suppress anybody's hopes
842.72s: and dreams I want you to have objective
846.68s: data to then make informed decisions so
848.84s: as always if there's any questions let
850.04s: me know be an outlier I'll see you guys
851.64s: later
