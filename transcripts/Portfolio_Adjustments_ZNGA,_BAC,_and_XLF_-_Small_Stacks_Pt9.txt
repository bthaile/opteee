0.72s: hey everyone eric here wanted to do a
3.04s: quick update on the small stacks
4.56s: portfolio
5.92s: and uh i've been a little bit more
7.68s: active in there than i was expecting to
9.52s: be
10.00s: primarily because i'm trying to balance
11.84s: two things in conjunction with one
13.92s: another and that's
15.12s: reducing risk as much as i can as well
18.24s: as capitalizing on opportunity
20.72s: as i see it emerge so in general i would
25.04s: expect to
26.56s: really be quite a bit less involved than
28.88s: i have been
30.16s: but i'm not opposed to making
32.96s: adjustments when i
34.08s: see that they're you know logical and
35.84s: they make sense so let's jump over the
37.20s: screen take a look
38.56s: first off i closed out zynga i sold that
41.76s: originally it was a eight and a half put
43.84s: sold it out on one september
46.16s: and i collected 27 cents i closed it for
48.56s: 18 cents so it's overall p
50.56s: l nine bucks again in this scenario it's
53.84s: really nothing to write home about
55.52s: it's essentially just commissions for a
58.16s: handful of trades or whatever
60.00s: but if we look at things in
63.76s: kind of a vacuum and use percentages to
67.44s: guide some of our decisions even
70.48s: closing that at 18 cents collecting nine
73.12s: dollars it's still over a percent return
75.36s: on the eight and a half put so going
78.16s: back to that message i continue
80.24s: to beat this isn't the account that
82.16s: you're going to make a bunch of money
83.20s: with
84.00s: turn in 5000 thousand twenty five
86.32s: thousand even a hundred thousand
87.92s: into a bunch of money isn't really in
90.40s: the in the cards for most folks
92.80s: what we're really looking to do is build
94.72s: a an
96.08s: approach that works so for me
99.36s: it was time to take those puts down
101.28s: because they were well within
103.04s: 20 days to expiration and that's my
105.04s: typical window for wanting to close
106.80s: those trades to limit my exposure to
108.80s: gamma risk
109.92s: so as soon as i saw a decent opportunity
112.80s: i took it
113.52s: and i would take it again and again
115.36s: because in this scenario it's the right
117.36s: move for me
118.88s: the other thing i did is i closed out of
121.36s: the bank of america
122.96s: bac the diagonal i had in there
126.16s: and the reason why i did that is because
128.00s: i wanted to establish a position in xlf
130.88s: uh coverage strangle so i neutralized
135.12s: the bac diagonal and that was an overall
138.72s: p
139.04s: l of positive 26 bucks so
143.36s: and it's not because i needed the money
145.20s: to open up xlf it's just because i
147.12s: didn't want
147.68s: xlf which is the financial sector etf
150.16s: and bac
151.84s: so the really the trade-off there is
155.92s: moving from bac to xlf which is
158.88s: that sector etf gives me more exposure
162.24s: it helps limit some of that
165.36s: unsystemic risk and as you can see it's
168.16s: a it's really good return for the money
170.08s: it's um almost a two percent return
173.52s: just shy of a two percent return on the
175.28s: capital uh tied up so
177.60s: i really like that trade and doing a
179.92s: covered strangle on something like an
181.28s: index etf is very appealing to me
183.52s: same thing with the sector etf so that's
185.20s: why i made that move i didn't want to
186.64s: replicate
187.36s: financials so where that puts us right
191.04s: now oh yeah and the other thing sorry
192.88s: is i ended up selling um
196.16s: a call in kroger so i had a good spot in
199.28s: there
200.00s: to lay out a call my intention there
203.44s: is to probably add to the position if it
206.72s: still hovers around
208.00s: where it is right now i was actually
209.28s: hoping it went just a little bit lower
211.04s: to add that
212.08s: other call the long call so
215.12s: it hasn't quite hit that threshold just
217.52s: yet as you can see
218.96s: i should obviously we can look at things
221.68s: historically
222.48s: what i was about to say is i should have
223.84s: added down here but i
225.60s: was more or less expecting it to come
227.12s: down a little bit more so
229.12s: i didn't want to sell during or i didn't
230.80s: want to buy in during these up days
232.72s: and i want to see what this down day
235.36s: turns into
236.40s: before i add additional capital to
238.96s: kroger but i am looking at
241.60s: scaling into that um
244.80s: that diagonal a little bit more so we'll
246.80s: see we'll see
248.00s: what opportunity comes up but for the
249.52s: meantime i just have a short call
251.52s: out to turn it into that covered
254.64s: position and collect a little bit more
256.88s: money up front so
258.24s: that's where i'm at in kroger so
261.76s: looking at the portfolio at large we're
263.84s: 64
264.80s: utilized we have 3600 in
268.24s: cash out total p l so far 616 dollars
272.16s: which represents about 11
274.32s: return since starting this on one
276.40s: september which again i'm
277.92s: really really stoked on that but there's
279.84s: an outlier pfizer was an outlier trade
282.00s: it returned really well very quickly so
285.68s: um you can see the general performance
287.76s: of the other trades fifty dollars
289.52s: or you know 24 bucks nine bucks 26 bucks
292.56s: kroger is another high earner and you
294.64s: can see right now that the diagonals are
296.56s: far
296.96s: outperforming the coverage strangle
298.96s: which is why i like to diversify some of
301.52s: the strategies i'm using
303.04s: to benefit when they're working because
305.28s: there's plenty of instances where the
306.88s: diagonal
307.44s: doesn't work well we started seeing that
309.44s: in kroger as it fell
310.64s: below where i could reasonably sell
313.12s: calls and collect money so i was
314.48s: essentially just holding the position
316.80s: so that's where balancing between
319.84s: the two different approaches is um it's
322.88s: a
323.28s: good good way to go about it for me
326.32s: so right now we have
330.08s: a hundred and sixteen dollars in credit
332.40s: out which represents another two percent
334.64s: return on the new on the entire
336.56s: portfolio so overall we're we're doing
339.44s: well
340.08s: we went from five thousand dollars to
342.28s: 5616
343.84s: so the account is growing and
347.28s: the most importantly the mechanics
350.32s: are leading us in in a good direction
352.48s: thus far
353.52s: so what i'm looking to do going forward
356.88s: is i probably will stay away
360.00s: from the covered strangle um i'll leave
363.04s: xlf as that primary position for now the
365.92s: reason is if i own
367.44s: stock in there i'm okay with it and i'll
369.92s: collect the dividend turn into a covered
371.52s: call that sort of thing but i want to be
373.04s: able to add more to it if i need to
375.12s: although i wouldn't expect to but what i
377.84s: would like to do is find
379.20s: another diagonal candidate so
382.40s: that will be my homework for this
384.08s: evening to find something else that
385.60s: looks
386.08s: attractive for a diagonal luckily in
389.12s: markets right now this is why i started
391.28s: making some of these moves because with
392.88s: some of the down moves in the market
394.64s: becomes very appealing for for
397.68s: a diagonal and entering into short
400.00s: premium positions
401.44s: on some sort of down move unlike my
403.84s: margin account
405.20s: i probably will not scale out of this
407.44s: very much leading
408.56s: into the election simply because it's
411.60s: such a small amount
412.72s: of capital that i would rather just
415.20s: maintain the exposure and write out the
416.96s: move
417.84s: but i will take down at least half of
421.04s: the account
422.08s: so i guess i am planning on scaling out
425.36s: just not anywhere near to the effect
427.28s: that i will be doing in my margin
428.72s: account
429.44s: and that's again just going back to the
431.60s: fact that i need to maintain exposure in
433.20s: this really small account
434.80s: so that is where we're looking right now
437.76s: next up
438.40s: will be if we find a good candidate
440.96s: otherwise
441.76s: the portfolio will sit as is and we'll
444.96s: look to take in that
446.24s: 116 bucks continue boosting the overall
449.20s: performance of the account
450.80s: so right now i'm looking we are
454.72s: just over one two three three weeks
458.56s: into the uh into the small stacks
460.72s: account
462.00s: we'll see what opportunity pops up
465.04s: and then otherwise we will hold tight
468.08s: as always if anybody's any questions or
469.68s: anything they want to talk about let me
470.96s: know
471.52s: and i will catch everybody later
