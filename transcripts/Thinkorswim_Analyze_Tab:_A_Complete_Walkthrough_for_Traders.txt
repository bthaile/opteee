0.76s: what's up outliers I'm going to walk you
2.32s: through some of my favorite ways to use
4.84s: the analyze tab in thinker swim actually
7.56s: came up during a workshop today so I
9.56s: figured this would be a good reference
10.84s: video for folks so there's a bunch of
12.80s: different things in the analyze tab on
15.16s: the top it's just outside the window so
16.84s: you can't see it but I'll read them off
18.16s: to you there's add simulated trades so
20.88s: this is kind of like paper trading
22.20s: there's the risk profile probability
24.48s: analysis economic data think back
28.00s: fundamentals and earnings we're going to
29.72s: go through all of them now simulated
31.40s: trades is kind of just paper trading for
33.28s: today I don't really use this much
35.52s: myself but it's in there in case you
37.32s: want it then the risk profile I use all
39.72s: the time and this helps us understand
42.28s: how a certain position is set to perform
45.96s: in a few different ways and I'll explain
48.00s: how so the Y AIS here is representing
51.64s: the p&l for the position this is your
53.96s: zero line anything above this is
56.40s: positive returning anything below
58.36s: negative you can see this goes from
60.12s: 1,000 2,000 3,000 so on and so forth
62.32s: same thing to the downside on the
63.56s: negative side now the
66.24s: xaxis shows us different prices for the
70.44s: underlying so you'll see it's
72.24s: essentially just increasing from left to
75.48s: right so it's you can zoom this in or
77.92s: out as you want as you can see just by
79.60s: clicking and dragging I can change the
81.56s: scale of things so I can compress things
84.08s: down super far or I can spread them out
86.88s: so that they make a little bit more
88.16s: sense for what we're looking at so
90.12s: that's this now these different vertical
93.24s: lines you can control to be whatever you
96.28s: want as you can see down here I have
99.16s: them currently as different standard
101.36s: deviations so I have + 1 plus 2 + 3 -1 -
104.96s: 2 - 3 and then this middle one is the
108.16s: spot price so we can tell 3679 which is
112.28s: right here it's telling us the current
114.08s: spot price which is this one so this is
116.96s: this line here so then as you move out
119.68s: this is minus well quick pause this is
125.08s: whatever essentially you want it to be
127.12s: you can set this to be whatever price so
129.60s: you'll also notice down at the bottom
131.36s: here I have a couple other prices that
133.88s: are key coded in one at $31.90 one at
136.92s: 4434 why is that well for this trade
139.60s: example that we were looking at those
142.00s: were the stops for the trade that we
144.96s: were looking at so in this case the 3190
147.76s: here and then the 4434 here actually
151.88s: represents those two positions so that I
154.32s: could easily see what the p&l would be
156.84s: at those so then in order to find the +
160.20s: one and minus one standard deviation you
162.24s: have to go out here and here and you'll
164.56s: notice it gives you the probabilities up
166.40s: here right so this says 15 85% this says
170.20s: 15 87% so it's automatically giving you
173.08s: the probabilities on top of them and
174.60s: then so on and so forth for the rest so
177.12s: you can change these actually you can
178.68s: change them by going over here and by
180.44s: hitting set slices you can do some sort
183.56s: of percentages is really really common
187.24s: there's another really common one that I
189.56s: like to use which shows like 5% steps in
192.88s: the in the underlying like this you can
195.96s: essentially make it whatever you want I
197.52s: find standard deviations to be most
199.20s: useful again I'm kind of uh statistic
201.24s: minded myself so then if you click the
204.04s: default it'll give you plus one minus
206.00s: one and then if you want to add more you
207.72s: can just hit this plus button on the
209.60s: right right hand side change these by
211.68s: clicking on them and then I can add my
214.96s: plus two minus 2 and then so on and so
217.76s: forth as much as I want so the other
221.24s: thing you'll notice on this is that as
223.84s: you look at this position you notice
225.24s: that there are two lines there actually
227.04s: can be even more we can have four lines
231.16s: if there were four legs but in this case
234.00s: there's not four legs there's
235.68s: technically only two legs so what are
238.24s: these different lines well if you'll
239.48s: notice this over here they give you
242.08s: three different dates so what these are
244.56s: showing you are the p&l for these
248.52s: specific combination of positions at
251.40s: different points so in this case 816
254.36s: that's today it's showing you the p&l
256.28s: for your trades today and then 97 it's
260.16s: using the first expiration for the
262.88s: closest expiring leg so in this case
265.56s: there's one leg in this trade this is I
267.68s: think a ratio called diagonal oh no this
269.32s: is called calls and puts I just picked
271.76s: random stuff for the example so in this
274.92s: case though the put side is in six seep
279.96s: so that's what the blue line is it's
282.00s: showing you when that leg would expire
285.20s: but again the blue line is still the
287.12s: entire position combined it's just
289.44s: giving you the date variance for
293.28s: whatever the first leg expires at and
296.80s: then the 1019 shows you the rest of the
300.48s: trade the longer expiration leg when
304.72s: this whole trade would look like when
307.00s: that comes up to expiration so obviously
309.72s: at that point the short calls would be
311.56s: or the in this case the short puts would
313.04s: be gone so the other thing you can do is
315.40s: Click into these and remove individual
318.56s: legs if you just want to see how
321.32s: something would
322.68s: perform which is kind of cool by
324.96s: isolating the individual legs a couple
328.12s: other notes you can change
330.84s: those different lines you can do it
332.60s: based on the passage of specific days
336.24s: changes in volatility it's really up to
338.44s: you you can also change the metric so
341.32s: it's showing the total p&l the p&l on
343.88s: the day the
345.48s: individual the Greeks so that you have a
348.60s: sense of how the position behaves as it
351.80s: moves around now for probability mode I
354.80s: like to use the probability of a touch
357.40s: because for most of the stuff that I use
360.36s: it is predicated on management as things
362.88s: get to different levels which is based
364.92s: more so again on touch because when we
367.20s: look at probability of in the money or
368.56s: out of the money that really refers to
370.12s: at expiration so I typically will use
372.56s: touch and then the probability range is
375.72s: adjustable so this is using a one
377.44s: standard deviation range you could do
378.92s: two standard deviation or three standard
380.52s: deviation ranges and then you can also
382.92s: use different times again based on the
386.20s: steps that you're using for the date up
388.80s: here so you write now it's defaulting to
392.00s: the long leg the longest expiration leg
395.32s: as the ultimate date but you can change
397.04s: that if you want so you'll notice as I
399.52s: hover over it and move around that in
402.40s: the middle it shows you the price at the
406.00s: p&l of the underlying so that's what it
408.16s: is right in the middle then down at the
409.76s: bottom it shows you the price of the
411.68s: underlying and then on the leftand side
414.00s: it shows you the p&l at those different
416.04s: points in time so then down here you'll
418.84s: see it shows you the position Delta
420.76s: gamma Theta Vega for each of those
423.60s: points and then it also shows you um the
427.56s: p&l for the individual day for open what
430.60s: the net liquidity would be and then the
432.64s: expected margin requirement so there's a
434.76s: ton a ton of details in here now a
438.00s: couple other small things you can Tinker
440.28s: with the interest rate down here or you
442.16s: can lock it so it doesn't change you can
444.36s: change the volatility pricing models so
447.32s: you can use kind of their propriety
448.96s: method that they kind of adjust slightly
451.28s: you can use binomial black shols
453.00s: whatever you want you can group the
455.16s: symbols into different things there's
457.24s: literally a ton the other thing that's
458.60s: really cool a lot of people don't know
460.20s: is you could look at the entire
461.68s: portfolio as compared to one individual
464.40s: ticker which is kind of nice so another
467.32s: note here is that if you click this
469.76s: little Cog on this side over here you
472.24s: can change the stock price in here as
475.12s: you want or more importantly you can
477.88s: change the volatility and if you hit
480.08s: this thing over here more parameters you
482.00s: can change the volatility for individual
484.60s: legs if you want this just helps you see
487.60s: how things move so that's a general
490.40s: walkthrough of this there's kind of some
491.96s: more quirky little things in there but I
493.92s: think that's kind of a good overview now
495.92s: probability analysis gives us a
498.56s: projection of future price so in this
501.80s: case it's taking the volatility of the
503.96s: underlying so in this case
506.44s: 77.36 and then it's projecting out in
508.88s: this case a cone so this really a
511.32s: parabola and it's using again a one
514.04s: standard deviation range now you can
515.60s: change this to be from probability of
518.16s: touching to be the probability of in the
519.96s: money and then you'll notice that our
522.40s: little Crosshair has two numbers on it
525.52s: so it's showing you the probability
526.84s: above and below whatever number you're
529.08s: hanging on so what that means is on the
531.96s: Y AIS is the price of the underlying and
535.40s: the xaxis is the date so this is date
539.12s: Zero today and then this is 10 days away
541.64s: 20 days 30 days 40 days 50 days so on
544.00s: and so forth and then this is showing
546.40s: you the price of the under Line This is
548.32s: obviously showing you essentially where
549.80s: the current spot price is so what I like
553.12s: to use again is the probability of a
554.80s: touch because that's typically what I'm
556.36s: managing by and you can see what the
559.32s: probability is of your position being
563.04s: touched at different price levels so for
565.60s: example you can tell right out of the
567.44s: gate for this 20 802 and this 47 again
572.16s: this cone is a one probability so
574.28s: that'll be about a 16% probability of a
576.96s: touch and if I change this from a one
579.20s: standard deviation to two you'll notice
581.84s: that it now represents like a two and
583.84s: change percent probability so these are
585.88s: just using standard deviations for the
588.68s: probability
590.12s: calculation what's really useful here is
593.24s: you can use the options chain for this
595.20s: information but it's also really simple
596.84s: to just look at in here so for example
599.00s: if I this trade down here that just
601.60s: happens to be short 34 puts and I'm like
604.44s: okay what's the probability of us
606.00s: hitting 34 by 6 September I can look at
610.28s: 6 September I can find the date again
612.44s: you can zoom it in as much as you want
614.56s: and then I can say what's the
615.64s: probability of us hitting 34 the
618.12s: probability of hitting 34 is like
621.72s: 69.99 per probability so now I know that
624.80s: for you know whatever reason I'm looking
627.88s: for that whether I'm trying to calculate
629.48s: expected return or so on and so forth so
633.00s: super super useful tool and then again
635.16s: you can adjust the volatility for the
637.00s: parameters down here if you would like I
639.52s: use both of these literally all the time
642.16s: now economic data is actually another
644.24s: really underutilized tab where you can
646.44s: take a look at different broad economic
649.56s: indicators and it literally plots them
651.52s: for you you can pick the format that you
654.00s: want you can change the ranges this is
656.12s: essentially coming from Fred which is
658.76s: the Federal Reserve economic data
660.64s: there's a ton of great details in here
662.44s: so the yeah I mean tons and tons of
666.48s: different things you can Tinker with in
667.76s: here think back is essentially the on
670.36s: demand feature but it's just in the
672.16s: normal portal right so you can pick a
674.56s: stock that you want to look at you could
675.92s: pick the date you want to go back into
677.96s: and then you can take a look at the
679.00s: options chain the chart at that time all
681.64s: those kinds of details and then the last
683.76s: couple things fundamentals exactly what
685.64s: it sounds like you can see what
687.80s: different rating agencies feel about the
690.28s: underlying the cool part about it is you
691.88s: can download their reports or you can
694.80s: see you know when new reports are
696.76s: launched so you can see actually what
698.48s: they're saying you can just get a quick
700.64s: update about the parameters I'm sorry
703.92s: the like background of the company not
705.52s: the parameters and then you can go to
708.16s: the website for the company here you can
710.28s: look at some of standard valuation
712.20s: metrics so annual or quarterly and this
716.40s: is another really cool tool because I
718.88s: feel like a lot of people don't fully
720.88s: utilize it because one of the other
723.28s: things I think a lot of people aren't
725.08s: familiar with is if you scroll down for
727.36s: some companies not all it'll give you a
729.96s: lot of details about the valuation of it
732.84s: and then it'll actually even give you a
734.76s: breakdown essentially of the company's
737.48s: market cap or the estimated value so you
740.56s: can click into it and then get Trends
743.64s: within that specific segment so right
746.20s: now looking at Boeing we can look at the
748.24s: Global Services arm which obviously
751.72s: comprises 43.9% of the market cap and
754.72s: you can see what the revenue looks like
757.16s: in there what they're actually selling
758.72s: what the competitors are the detail in
760.96s: here is actually like really really good
763.12s: I think so there's that context for you
766.84s: and then the last thing I use all the
768.20s: time is for earnings so this gives me
771.72s: context about the underlying price
774.88s: before and after the release so you can
777.04s: see the release date is in the center we
779.32s: can look at implied versus historical
781.12s: volatility the pricing of the straddle
783.08s: and then how the actual versus estimates
787.28s: line up with one another now this is
789.44s: kind of the last eight quarters together
792.40s: you can zoom in a little bit more so
795.20s: this gives you a little more granularity
797.32s: in terms of what time frames you're
798.68s: looking at then you can also compare
801.40s: them across different quarters so this
803.84s: is comparing the IV the HV the straddle
807.56s: price and then the stock price again pre
809.92s: and post- relase so you can see down
811.36s: here Center shows earnings announced and
814.32s: then it shows you 5 days before with all
816.28s: those parameters and then 5 days after
818.40s: you can zoom in a little bit if you need
821.32s: it is again just another really really
824.28s: cool tool I think you can also change
827.08s: the specific quarters that you want to
829.40s: compare out of curiosity so yeah just
832.80s: another absolutely awesome tool in my
835.72s: opinion that I use all of the time as
839.24s: always if there's any questions just let
840.52s: me know be an outlier I'll see you guys
842.24s: later
