0.00s: What is up, the ape community, it is Eric and yet again, I come and piece them here to
5.68s: talk about options.
6.68s: I'm actually following up on a prior video that I did and actually kind of a mini series
11.52s: that I'm starting to do about trading options in something like GameStop, although if you're
17.92s: not trading GameStop, what I'm covering today is applicable to you anyways, because what
22.00s: I'm going to talk about is adjusting in the money short calls, which ideally that's what
29.60s: we want to happen.
30.60s: If we're selling calls as part of a ratio covered call, which is what we reviewed in
36.36s: the last video, I'll throw a link to that in the description in case you haven't seen
40.56s: that.
41.56s: The whole point of this strategy is we're going to hold shares of an equity in this example
47.00s: GameStop and we want to hold the equity anyways.
50.88s: That's the premise.
52.20s: And then we are holding something longer term, whatever you're holding duration is part
56.80s: of your plan.
57.88s: But there are going to be periods where a stock might be a little more mellow and we
62.64s: can see periods like that in this timeframe, right?
65.80s: So we can see GameStop from really the middle slash end of the summer until the 11th of
72.64s: November has been pretty range bound.
75.12s: So if you're holding equity during that duration, it's not really doing a whole lot, but you
79.40s: can sell some calls against some of your shares in order to collect some premium upfront.
84.84s: However, as with anything in trading, there's always a catch.
88.44s: The catch in this instance is sooner or later, the thing that you're selling calls in can
95.08s: start to move and it can start to move pretty fast.
98.12s: That can create a problem, especially if you're actually not wanting to unwind your shares,
103.68s: which that's why we do it at a ratio.
106.20s: So the prior video walks through the basis of this ratio covered call and how it strikes
113.28s: a bounce between taking in some premium upfront, but preserving upside, especially in case
118.52s: things start to get out of handings moving really, really fast because it can happen.
122.44s: You can get caught.
123.96s: However, especially in something like GameStop, which is very picky, there are a lot of
130.44s: chances for you to adjust your trade so that you can keep your shares, but still will
136.24s: be able to sell some short calls to collect something.
139.76s: And we actually went through an example during a prior live stream and I captured data
144.08s: from that that I'm going to review now.
146.68s: And this is really to condense down all of the lessons of that live stream into a palatable
151.00s: format so that you can follow along the train of thought.
153.88s: And then as always, if you have questions as we go through this, please let me know.
157.80s: That's the whole point of this.
159.24s: So if you'll recall, we used the example of this date here, the 16th of April.
167.44s: Why did we do that?
168.92s: Because I wanted to pick as disadvantage point is humanly possible to start selling calls.
176.04s: Why is this so disadvantage because the stock is at a low?
179.04s: So that means everything passed this point in hindsight.
181.84s: The stock has been higher.
183.24s: So we're selling short calls into what we now know in the future to be a very difficult
189.76s: time because it's just straight up, especially into this short squeeze that we had.
195.36s: So I thought this would provide a great example of how you can manage short calls in a very
202.64s: challenging environment because managing a short call in this kind of environment, super
206.88s: easy.
208.28s: It's been a slow gradual move up.
210.88s: It's had some down ticks.
212.32s: This is easy days to manage a short call.
215.52s: This is challenging.
216.56s: And the reason why this is so challenging is because when we get in, the price of GameStop
221.40s: for the example was in like the 10 handle.
225.12s: And then it's not seen that again.
226.96s: It's essentially never been not double that.
230.00s: So we're literally dealing with something where when we entered and started selling calls
233.64s: against it, it is doubled in price and not come back, which provides a really, really
238.24s: great example for us to work through.
241.76s: So this is the original video that I did about trading options in GameStop.
250.20s: And this one obviously introduces the ratio covered call.
253.80s: And then the video that we're in now is going to talk about the management.
257.16s: I realize that I don't have the same exact shirt on, but it's pretty damn close.
260.76s: I also realize that my forehead is disgustingly shiny.
264.44s: That's a little nerve wracking, but that stuff aside, this is what we captured.
270.48s: So I don't expect you to know what this is right out of the gate.
272.92s: This is a very, very basic log that I built for us to go through the example together.
277.36s: So I'm going to describe to you what this is now.
280.04s: So you can test it out for yourself.
282.08s: That's the point.
283.16s: Now the entire premise of a ratio covered call is that you want to hold more than 100 shares.
289.92s: You have to be able to create a ratio.
292.64s: Why does it have to be that?
295.64s: Because of this, I will show you what I'm going to draw for you because it's a little easier.
300.00s: So if we have 100 shares, our PNL graph will look like this with this.
306.36s: Well, let's see if I can get at least a little greater than that.
311.76s: Something like that.
312.76s: This is the zero line.
314.64s: Now when you have anything over, well, first let me just reset and do what if we sell
320.40s: a call against this?
321.40s: So if you have 100 shares and then you sell one call, your PNL graph is now going to
328.20s: turn into this.
330.32s: And you see that it levels off.
332.16s: Just pretend that these lines are level.
334.28s: And that means that you now have capped profit potential, anything above the strike of
339.40s: this call.
340.68s: So what this can turn into though is provided that you have greater than 100 shares.
345.68s: Literally even 101 will do it.
348.56s: Anything greater than 100 shares, it turns it into this where it still will maintain an
357.44s: upside profit potential because this one share is now not covered.
362.48s: You have 100 shares that are covered by this one short call because remember each short
368.24s: call represents up to negative 100 shares.
371.60s: So these two cancel out.
373.20s: That leaves you are one share alone and unafraid out there to build profit for you.
378.88s: So the name of the game there is to determine how many shares you want, how many short
383.52s: calls you want.
384.52s: And the prior video goes through all of that.
386.68s: In this video, I want to specifically talk about the management of the short calls because
389.68s: that's a tricky part of this game.
391.40s: So if we think about selling short calls, we first need to start with identifying the
397.56s: risks, specifically in the context of selling short calls in something that we do not want
404.80s: to take assignment and meaning what we don't want to be assigned.
409.40s: We kind of are forced on the cell side.
412.44s: We don't want to be assigned, meaning we want to keep our shares.
415.68s: That's the first context.
416.88s: So what are our risks?
418.56s: Well, if the stock goes above our strike price and we're in here, this technically is a
427.44s: risk, this zone.
429.80s: Why is this, why is this a risk?
432.08s: It's an opportunity cost because if we have a stock that we're holding the downside risk
437.40s: for and it eventually makes a massive up move and we can't participate, that means that
443.96s: we've taken all of this risk and we've not got the commensurate payoff for this risk.
450.24s: So that can be part of your strategy, can be accepted, it can be fine.
453.96s: It's just a consideration that is an absolute opportunity cost I consider that a risk to
458.36s: the strategy.
459.60s: The second risk in the context of you not wanting to let go of your shares is early assignment.
464.92s: This is one we're going to have to pay attention to, especially on something that tends to have
470.92s: really big moves.
472.76s: Now, when are we at risk of early assignment?
477.36s: There's two primary periods.
480.28s: The first one is when extrinsic value is about zero and this really becomes more pertinent
491.68s: I would consider when it's less than a dime, 0.10.
496.16s: And even that's a little high, that's kind of like an early warning system when it's
499.40s: like sub-a-nickel is when I would consider to be moderately accessible, but even then
505.16s: it's not entirely rational.
508.28s: And we'll talk about why early assignment is not necessarily the biggest risk if it's
514.88s: managed, but we have to manage it.
517.40s: Now the second period is if we have a dividend coming up and the dividend yield is greater
526.68s: than the extrinsic value.
530.40s: So let's talk about these two scenarios really fast because if you're new to options, this
535.36s: might make no sense to you and that's okay.
537.76s: We will literally be able to describe all of it very, very simply.
543.08s: And what I want to do is actually go over to the platform and use some live examples
548.24s: because I think this might be a little easier if you can look at a live example with me.
555.28s: So let's take a look at GameStop.
556.68s: Let's go to 13Ds and let's take a look at these options.
560.36s: And if you'll recall, every single option has two forms of its value.
566.60s: That's what creates the premium of an option.
568.80s: We have intrinsic and extrinsic value.
571.00s: Intrinsic value is simply how far in the money something is.
575.68s: Extrinsic value is a composition of time value, how much days, how many days are left,
582.04s: the expiration and then also volatility.
585.72s: So if we have an option and let's say we look at this 25 strike, just had a curiosity.
593.96s: And we say the 25 strike right now and we'll take a couple notes so that actually I can
598.36s: just do it right in here so we can look at it real together.
602.56s: So we take a look at this 25 strike right here and let's say that we're short the 25 call
607.00s: that is not pretty far in the money by like $4.50.
610.12s: That's the current premium.
613.20s: Spot price right now is, well, let's just call Spot price 29.
617.96s: And we have a strike price of 25.
620.52s: So that means we have $4 of intrinsic value.
628.88s: And the reason why I know it's $4 of intrinsic values because our strike price is 25.
633.72s: The underlying is currently trading at 29.
636.36s: So the difference between those because this is a call and we're in the money, intrinsic
641.16s: value.
642.48s: Then for the extrinsic value, I just showed you that the option here is trading at a premium
646.40s: of $4.50.
648.16s: So if we have $4.50, less our intrinsic value gives us $0.50.
657.96s: So this is how much extrinsic value is left in the options.
662.72s: So even though these 25s are in 80 delta, they're pretty far in the money.
666.52s: They're not actually at massive risk of early assignment right now.
669.56s: Why is that the case?
671.56s: Well, first one, as you'll recall, there's not even a dividend here, right?
675.88s: We know that there's no dividend in game stop right now.
677.96s: So that's not a scenario we have to concern ourselves with.
682.44s: Now why not just early assignment because whoever's holding these options, if they exercise,
688.04s: well, that means that they can get the, they can buy the stock at 25.
692.16s: That's pretty awesome because otherwise if they bought it on the market, it'd be at 29.
696.00s: Why wouldn't they do that?
697.76s: It's because they throw this away.
700.76s: So let's take a look at the actual transactions as that would, as would occur.
706.68s: So we have the option buyer, the other side of your trade.
710.72s: So they bought to open and they bought to open, let's just use current price at $4.50 or
717.24s: whatever.
719.16s: So they bought to open one at $4.50.
722.24s: So they paid a $450 debit.
726.36s: Now they're like, yo, I want to exercise.
728.08s: Cool.
729.08s: So then they hit the broker up and they say exercise my options.
732.20s: So what's going to happen here is they're going to buy to open 100 shares at their strike
739.28s: price of 25.
741.52s: So then this is going to cost them their 25 per times 100.
747.20s: Oops, that's most of the rest of the, this is in the wrong spot.
751.84s: Ignore that.
753.48s: This is what they're going to pay out of pocket.
755.88s: And when they do this, this goes away.
759.12s: This vanishes.
760.48s: So right now they would have an unrealized profit of the difference between these two things,
768.20s: which again is $400.
769.48s: It's the intrinsic value.
771.92s: So what happened in this scenario is they just lost 50 bucks.
776.36s: The reason why they lost 50 bucks is when they exercise, they get to buy it at 25.
781.16s: They're going to pay $2,500.
782.88s: The stock is currently at 29 and unrealized gain of 400 bucks.
787.04s: You capture the intrinsic value.
788.96s: That's great.
790.12s: But the extrinsic value is just gone.
792.80s: You give that up.
794.56s: So the more efficient transaction here for the option buyer is to sell to close.
802.76s: And again, we're just going to use current spot price, but then they can sell to close
806.08s: at $450.
809.24s: Notice the difference in this scenario.
811.48s: If they sell the option to close, they literally make $50 more dollars.
816.76s: It's otherwise the same thing.
818.68s: So this is exactly why early exercise in general just doesn't make sense because you're just
825.84s: giving up extrinsic value.
827.16s: The reason why all this detail matters is because you have to understand the counter-party
831.56s: to your trade.
832.56s: What they're thinking, what they might be doing, what your risk might be because you
835.48s: if you remember, this is about managing in the money short calls.
840.96s: So as soon as your short call falls in the money, it's not immediately at risk of early
846.16s: assignment.
847.16s: And in the case of a dividend for those wondering, the time that it makes sense is if the dividend
853.76s: is greater than this extrinsic value.
856.80s: So if there's a stock that pays a dollar per share, you would be better off exercising
864.96s: your option in this scenario.
867.32s: And then you rate the dividend provided that it's by X-DivD, which gives you an extra $100.
873.72s: Excuse me, I have 100 shares.
875.96s: So yes, you throw this $50 away, but then you net $50 extra.
882.68s: So you cover that $50 loss with this $100.
885.24s: And then you make another $50 on top of it.
887.56s: It makes you whole and you make a little bit more money.
890.56s: So the time that this becomes at risk for early assignment with respect to something that
894.76s: is a dividend is if the dividend value is greater than your extrinsic value because then
901.64s: it makes sense for the holder to take the dividend.
904.80s: So if you made nothing else is factored into the equation, maybe they don't have the
908.44s: money to take the inventory.
909.96s: Maybe they don't want to deal with them drop after the dividend.
912.08s: There's a million other things, but this is the theoretical backdrop for it.
916.80s: So now you should be able to answer the question of when are we at risk of early assignment
923.80s: and where at risk of early assignment, if there's very, very little extrinsic value left,
928.16s: meaning the person doesn't mind throwing it away, or if there's a dividend coming up
933.48s: that's greater than the current extrinsic value of your short call.
938.12s: So now we have those two scenarios.
939.52s: Great.
940.52s: Now we can talk about managing in the money short calls.
943.36s: The reason why this matters so much, especially in something that moves a lot is you have
947.36s: to know when you're at risk of losing your shares if you're trying to keep them.
951.00s: Now one giant caveat has to be made here.
955.00s: This is why I use a ratio because you still could be assigned.
961.52s: You can exercise even if it doesn't financially make sense.
965.16s: It is their right to exercise whenever they want.
968.60s: So you have to be prepared even in that highly unlikely scenario and it's highly unlikely
974.04s: it still could happen.
975.68s: So what I would tell somebody is if you have long shares and you just don't want to let
979.64s: them go, don't sell calls against them.
981.92s: Just don't do it because there is a risk.
984.16s: Even if we do all these things to mitigate it, there is a risk structurally.
988.76s: It's very, very small, but it's there.
991.20s: So if you're in the camp, don't want to let the shares go, the same for you.
994.24s: If you're in the camp like the scenario that we're talking about and we use the scenario
998.64s: of gaining entry on 16 April when the stock was around 10 and a half and this person bought
1003.36s: a thousand shares.
1004.52s: This is a hypothetical scenario.
1006.00s: This was our entry trade.
1009.24s: So in this case, we started on the 16th of April with this position.
1015.28s: We sold four of the 17 May 12 strikes and we collected 45 cents.
1021.48s: This was the starting scenario that we begun with.
1025.96s: This stock at this point was trading like 10 30.
1028.04s: It's just because we were using on demand.
1029.40s: That's why these aren't the exact same.
1032.80s: So what happened after this first transaction on the 23rd of April, we ended up taking
1038.32s: this down for 21 cents and we made a profit of $96.
1044.56s: So what we did at this point was buy a handful of more shares and really you could argue
1050.48s: that we should have done nine shares, I think.
1053.00s: Yeah, nine shares is in the to make all the numbers work out.
1056.68s: So on the 23rd of April, when we exited this position and we made 96 bucks on the same
1063.16s: day, technically it could have been the same day towards the end of the day or it could
1067.52s: have been the following day on the open.
1069.56s: But we bought nine shares essentially taking the P&L, the realized P&L from that trade.
1074.52s: And we just bought more shares with it.
1075.80s: So we added nine shares for 91 bucks.
1078.96s: So now our total position is a thousand nine shares.
1082.16s: This is our total cost 10,5001 and then we have our total composite basis, which again
1088.32s: is just right around 1050.
1091.20s: So this was I just picked a spot to start.
1094.08s: This obviously wasn't a challenged position.
1096.24s: This thing had no issues whatsoever.
1098.28s: This was in this time frame in here.
1100.52s: But the next trade is where things get spicy.
1104.04s: So on the 23rd of April and we can go back to that day and on demand, it'll take a
1109.12s: second for it to load.
1110.88s: But let's go back to the 23rd of April here and I'll let that start to load while we're
1115.44s: there.
1116.44s: That's where we took this down and that's where we opened up our next trade.
1120.08s: And that was another four lot of the 21 June 14s now for 54 cents.
1125.08s: So notice a few things.
1126.20s: The first thing is if you take a look, we're keeping a really healthy ratio.
1131.12s: We use an example with a five lot.
1133.04s: We use an example now with a four lot.
1135.36s: But the whole point is if we have a four lot, that means we have 600 and nine shares
1141.28s: that are uncovered.
1142.80s: So this means we still have massive profit potential and we're only using this to collect
1146.84s: a few dollars up front while we're waiting.
1149.16s: In this case, we're getting a $216 credit.
1151.72s: And again, this is under the context of the stock is going down.
1155.40s: We don't really know that there's going to be a massive squeeze if we actually put ourselves
1158.92s: in this scenario.
1160.48s: I don't think anybody knew it, especially at this point, there was no sign in the options
1163.92s: markets that anything squirrelly was going on.
1167.92s: None of that was there.
1169.60s: So with all of that being said, we can rationally say, okay, let's try to sell some calls, make
1176.52s: some money while this thing is going down.
1178.20s: Maybe we scoop up some more shares because we like game stop.
1180.60s: We like the stock thing is going to go up.
1182.84s: So that's what we did.
1184.88s: We have this position on now and we literally can go on to the option chain together and
1189.16s: take a look at it.
1190.16s: So we go in here.
1191.16s: I think I said we did the 21 June.
1193.40s: Why didn't we do the 17 May?
1195.60s: It's because if you remember in the last video, we try to strike a balance with the duration,
1201.24s: how much money we're making, how much time the trade has to work and whatnot.
1204.52s: I purposely use the 59 days to expiration to actually hamper myself.
1209.44s: This makes this scenario more challenging.
1211.44s: Why doesn't make it more challenging?
1213.24s: Well, it makes it more challenging because there's so much time left in these options.
1217.24s: You actually run out of what I call expiration liquidity.
1222.64s: So you notice here that there's an expiration in three days, then in 10 days.
1227.08s: So there's a seven day difference here, then a seven day difference here, then a seven
1230.08s: day difference here.
1231.28s: But then notice as you go further out here, it expands.
1234.52s: It's much greater than a seven day difference between these two and then between these two.
1239.56s: So as we get further out in time, there's less expiration just because there's less liquidity,
1244.40s: there's not as many people trading that far out.
1246.80s: So we tend to see centralized liquidity and near term explorations, especially in something
1251.40s: like GameStop.
1253.00s: So this puts me at a disadvantage because we actually have a big move in this scenario
1256.96s: shortly after entry.
1258.32s: And this is all the way out like 60 days to go.
1260.56s: This is about the max that I would sell short calls unless there's a stringent circumstances
1265.44s: which we'll talk about in a second.
1267.20s: So we come in here and what did I say that we picked?
1270.48s: We did the 14s for 54 cents.
1272.64s: They might trade.
1273.64s: Yeah.
1274.64s: So they're trading right around there.
1275.64s: The timing is slightly different.
1276.80s: I'm using 0,900 Pacific time.
1278.44s: I'm just picking something.
1279.88s: So we'll just say that this is 54 cents for the example.
1283.80s: Great.
1285.04s: So now let's fast forward time because we can tell and we know that things start to get
1290.12s: really spicy.
1291.28s: So let's go fast forward a week and see what happens.
1295.84s: So stock starts to rally.
1297.60s: Now in my world of managing short calls, if the stock rallies like this, I don't really
1303.28s: care.
1304.28s: I'm not even at my short strike yet.
1306.00s: There's not a lot for me to do.
1307.52s: So I'm not going to bother doing anything.
1309.56s: Now another admin note when it comes to managing short calls, one of the best things or
1316.12s: managing any short option by the way, one of the best times to roll is when the strike
1321.92s: price equals the stock price when they're the same.
1326.52s: Why is that the case?
1328.84s: Well, it's because if we take a look, let's go to the 17 DTE for the example.
1337.20s: If we take a look at stock price equals strike price, meaning the at the money.
1342.56s: Let's just call it the 11s.
1344.68s: These 11s, let's say that you sold the 11 calls back when it was nine.
1349.84s: So these were out of the money and then they come at the money.
1353.76s: This is showing you that directly you're wrong.
1356.76s: The stock is moving.
1358.96s: Now whether it sustains the move, we don't know.
1361.72s: But when an option is at the money, it is the point where it has the most X-transic value.
1369.88s: So there's a part of natural traders that I don't want to buy that back.
1373.72s: If I sold it, that doesn't make sense.
1376.48s: However, as an option goes further and further in the money, it gains more and more intrinsic
1386.16s: value and it has less and less X-transic value.
1391.96s: So when you buy back a really deep in the money option, you're buying back a ton of intrinsic
1399.36s: value that does not decay.
1401.40s: It's intrinsic.
1402.92s: So that means you have to go really far out in time in order to compensate via X-transic
1409.60s: value, all of that intrinsic value that you have to buy back.
1415.92s: So we'll take a look at a couple examples of that to help the point settle in.
1419.76s: Feel free to listen to that one or two times through if that sounds super weird.
1423.40s: But it has everything to do with the constitution of the price of the premium and how we can
1428.64s: manage it.
1429.64s: So again, if you don't need all those details suffice it to say, you will have the most
1434.80s: amount of choices as you're being challenged to roll your option when the strike price
1441.48s: is equivalent to the stock price, give or take doesn't be exactly, but close enough.
1446.32s: That's when extrinsic value is the highest.
1448.60s: That's what ultimately will decay out of your option.
1451.96s: So if we take a look, let's say we had these six calls, there's like no extrinsic value
1456.20s: left.
1457.20s: Let's say that they're trading for $5.12 and I want to roll them.
1461.28s: It means if I want to roll these for a credit, I have to get at least $5.12.
1465.72s: So where can I get $5.12?
1467.44s: Well, if I roll out to the seven junes and I look at the sixes, can I get $5.12?
1473.48s: Maybe the bid as spread is so wide because it's so far in the money unless I can hit it
1479.28s: at the midpoint, I might not be able to.
1482.28s: That's because it's so far in the money I'm buying back so much intrinsic value that
1487.68s: my choices are truly limited and notice how I can't get any basis improvement.
1492.56s: There's no way that I'll be able to get these six and a halfs again because of liquidity.
1497.28s: I need to get at least $5.12 if I get filled there.
1499.56s: The probability of me getting $5.15 on these and moving up half a point is very low.
1504.80s: Definitely can't get a point improvement because these are for $4.70.
1507.80s: Now let's take a look at another scenario.
1510.36s: If we had the elevenths, the elevenths fall in the money, you have to buy these back
1513.60s: for $1.15.
1515.24s: So let's go out to that same expiration and see where can we get $1.15?
1518.64s: We can get it here at the 13.
1522.04s: We can get $1.19.
1524.04s: But notice the basis improvement we get.
1526.16s: We can move from an 11 strike to a 13 strike.
1528.76s: I can move two points away in the same time frame as compared to the other scenario
1533.84s: that I would be lucky to move 50 cents.
1537.08s: So that's how that relationship works.
1539.72s: And it's a delicate balance between expiration, liquidity, meaning if you go too far out in time
1545.56s: and then the move just keeps happening, you just have to sit there and deal with it
1548.84s: because you can't keep rolling out forever.
1550.40s: You're literally going to run out of expiration cycles to pick from.
1555.12s: So that's the balance act here.
1558.36s: So going back to this, we sell these and let's now fast forward and get some time under
1567.04s: our belts.
1568.04s: Let's go to the 7 May expiration.
1571.56s: Ah, starts rallying here.
1575.40s: Now, in reality, if this were my actual trade, I absolutely would roll it in one of these
1584.08s: three days.
1585.08s: There's no doubt in my mind.
1586.80s: And it's for a litany of different reasons.
1588.48s: It's not because of I know what's going to happen because obviously I do.
1593.04s: But when you see this kind of one-sided massive strengthen something that takes a pause,
1599.36s: that's a great time to try to get an adjustment.
1601.56s: So let's take a look at what we could have adjusted for.
1604.60s: We're not going to because I'm again, trying to use a really difficult scenario for the
1608.88s: example.
1610.08s: So I'm not giving myself the easier out that I would take.
1613.20s: I'm just letting you know that there's no way that I would let it run through those
1617.00s: three days and not do something with it.
1619.28s: So let's see what these 21 June 14s are trading for right now.
1624.36s: So the 21 June are still 45 days out.
1628.60s: And these 14s are now a dollar and a half in the money.
1631.56s: There's a lot of extrinsic value left.
1633.32s: We could take these in for $3.90.
1637.16s: The only choice you have is rolling it out 73 days.
1641.08s: So if we go out here and we see where can we get $3.90, you can get it to the 15s.
1649.08s: And this is the problem with waiting too long.
1651.48s: Because with this kind of move in something like GameStop, as this is making these meteoric
1656.12s: rises, volatility is jacking up.
1659.48s: So everything is becoming uniform more expensive.
1662.92s: So you might not even be able to get your basis adjustment if you're taking those in for
1666.16s: $3.90 to get your role for a net credit.
1668.96s: Now you don't always have to get a net credit to have a total positive role scenario.
1675.96s: So what does that mean?
1676.96s: Let's use a little bit of scratch paper over here.
1679.48s: So on this trade, we made $96.
1681.84s: So let's throw in $96.
1684.08s: And then here we had $54 cents.
1689.32s: So let's drop $54 cents here.
1693.64s: And then we had what?
1694.64s: A for a lot.
1696.16s: So in this case, we took in a credit of $2.16 times $100 to $16.
1706.16s: So this is where we're at so far.
1709.08s: So let's say we buy these back for $387.
1711.92s: Let's see what happens in this scenario.
1714.24s: This is what the other trade made already.
1717.24s: So let's say we buy these back now for $387.
1722.20s: So $3.87.
1725.80s: So oh no, I'm sorry, I said $3.90.
1729.48s: And then these ones are for $3.80.
1732.20s: So in this scenario, $3.90.
1734.24s: So what's our P&L here?
1735.92s: Well, it's this, minus this.
1738.72s: So we lose $3.36.
1740.76s: That's the net loss that we're taking.
1742.52s: So realistically, this is what we need to make.
1746.16s: Because we're just essentially counting this $54 bucks that we collected as a net credit.
1750.04s: And we're just saying, yeah, okay, maybe we just give that back.
1754.12s: We're not counting that as part of the total loss because that was just a credit that
1757.84s: was tied to an open trade.
1759.52s: So this is what you actually need to make.
1762.44s: And then if we take a look, then we have another for a lot.
1767.36s: And we do it for $3.87.
1771.36s: This is not a net credit.
1772.96s: Your shy, three cents.
1776.20s: But in actuality, you're still fine.
1779.40s: You would make money.
1780.72s: So let's take a look at this times 100.
1785.00s: I'm just doing all the math out for you this times 100.
1790.24s: So what happens here?
1791.52s: You'll notice that even though from $3.90, what we closed at, to selling to open the
1796.20s: new ones at $3.87, which is a $3. debit technically between these, you still actually
1803.96s: have collected enough once you include the prior credit you received here.
1807.68s: And then the prior PNL of the original call.
1809.68s: Now you don't have to include this because we put this in stock technically.
1812.92s: This is gone.
1814.12s: But I just want to make sure when people say like you always have to roll for a net credit,
1818.28s: you don't actually have to.
1819.28s: You just have to track your math really well.
1822.32s: And in this case, you would be fine in this hypothetical scenario.
1825.36s: But let us continue beyond this because for the sake of the scenario, we did not do that.
1830.16s: We literally waited until the last moment that we could, which would have been on the
1835.24s: 13th of May.
1836.76s: The reason why the 13th of May was the last moment you'll see.
1844.96s: Big giant move.
1847.96s: Big giant move.
1850.16s: Now if we take a look at our 21 June's and we have the 14's, let's take a look at these
1857.28s: 14's, you'll notice a really important detail now.
1861.88s: We are running really, really fast out of extrinsic value, really fast.
1868.20s: These have gone so far in the money, they're at an 86 delta.
1872.12s: They're essentially $15 in the money.
1875.76s: So right now there's maybe a dollar and change left of extrinsic value.
1880.40s: So you don't have to, you know that you don't have to take these down yet.
1883.68s: There's enough value in them to be okay.
1886.76s: But I think what we did in the scenario on the other live stream is we actually looked
1891.08s: at it early in the morning, because early in the morning, it was even higher.
1897.48s: Not yet.
1898.48s: So maybe we have to go to like 730.
1900.08s: Let's try that.
1901.88s: Just eyeball on the price here.
1902.88s: Yeah, something like this.
1905.20s: I think we're close to, we're going to exactly what time it hit that.
1908.84s: It's obviously sometime between 730 and 630.
1912.64s: But what I did for the example is I made it so that we're like this right here.
1916.08s: We're very close to the very top.
1918.04s: So right now the spot price is not 29.
1920.24s: It'll be like 36.
1922.04s: So these will be even worse once this buffers, which we'll see in a second.
1928.12s: And this is why you have to pay attention to the amount of extrinsic value.
1931.44s: And then the risk of early assignment, because the other scenario that's going on here is
1936.56s: people are going to be clamoring to get shares if they think that this is another full
1940.64s: on short squeeze, because that can be catastrophic as we know.
1944.16s: So the risk of early assignment will go up even more as volatility starts to crack off.
1950.08s: So in this scenario, you can see that it hit a peak of like 2305 of
1956.08s: in just overall cost and of that it's $21 in the money.
1962.40s: So there's still extrinsic value, but a lot, it's just, it's buried right now.
1967.28s: So that's why in the scenario, we actually waited a little bit.
1971.28s: We waited as the stock came down to 2593.
1974.40s: It was a random spot that we picked and we closed it for $15.45.
1979.76s: This represents a $5,964 loss big loss.
1984.48s: What I try to tell people is when you're trading this kind of strategy, you have to have patience,
1987.84s: because that's the way that this works in the long run.
1990.40s: We're taking losses upfront, we're realizing losses upfront.
1994.72s: But as long as we are capable of continuing to roll and adjust the trade and or eventually,
2001.68s: letting the shares get called away, then we can ultimately make money.
2007.12s: How does that process work?
2008.72s: Let's take a look at kind of the rest of the way that this goes.
2012.80s: So somebody said, I think before, I forgot, we looked at an example in the live stream where
2019.76s: somebody said something about, well, this is only because the stock didn't keep going up or
2025.12s: something like that. And it's a great point. So let's say that gamestop actually maintained
2030.00s: this meteoric rise and you were in the very, very rare but possible scenario that you just couldn't
2038.00s: roll. So let's pretend all of this isn't here.
2041.76s: And let's say that you originally sold this for $0.54 and let's say that in order to close this
2047.28s: here, let's say that this was like $30. So this would have been a massive amount of money
2051.92s: in order for you to close. So instead of $15, it's double that. So instead of it costing $6,000
2058.48s: debit, it's like a $13,000, what the rest of the change added in. So like a $13,000 debit,
2064.16s: something like that, just a massive amount of money to close. And let's just say that the stock kept
2067.92s: going up. And there was no point to roll. Well, that's when you have to be prepared to part with
2072.80s: the shares. And that's why we do it at a lower amount. Because even though that you're unwinding,
2078.80s: some of your shares at this point, 400 of them, you're going to make a killing because you got
2083.04s: in for 10 and a half. And in the scenario that we're talking about here, maybe it's at like 60,
2087.44s: the stock. So you make a ton of money. And more importantly, you always have that exit window of
2094.08s: just let it just let it get assigned, just let it be done. Because let's use one other scenario.
2099.20s: Let's say you completed that first role. And then you were like, okay, this, this isn't working
2105.20s: anymore. Let's say we're in this scenario now. And what I'm trying to show you is that you always
2110.64s: have that exit. So in this scenario, we sold the first for 45 bought it back for 21. We made 96
2121.12s: bucks. Then we sold for 54 bought it back for 15, 45. We lost $6,000 about. And we're like, okay,
2132.96s: this is getting rough. One thing you'll notice is that I actually increase the lot size. We go from
2140.40s: four to six. Why do we do that? It's so that we can get a basis adjustment. As I showed you in that
2147.28s: other example, trying to roll the sixes. Once they fall so far in the money and there's so little
2152.08s: extrinsic value, it's very difficult to get anything back out of these without adding a little bit
2157.28s: more risk. Now what's the drawback? The drawback is now instead of having 200 shares, you have 200
2164.16s: more shares covered here. You go from four to six. So you have to be prepared to run this all
2168.16s: the way through either through management or acknowledging at some point that the jig is up and
2173.44s: you're going to have to let now this new number of shares go. If you're uncomfortable with that,
2177.84s: you either take the exit here or you just try to roll out and not improve your basis or you go
2183.52s: out further in time. Like there's other choices available to you. This is a slightly more aggressive
2188.16s: approach, but it's designed to get us out of trouble faster. You have to have the stomach for it.
2192.48s: That's all there is to it. And again, if you're uncomfortable with that, don't do it. You don't
2195.68s: have to do it. But in this case, I'm able to improve my basis by a dollar, even though the stock
2200.64s: has gone up 60% from when I first entered this position. So this is a massive win to be able to
2207.44s: make this kind of adjustment. But all that aside, let's say after that adjustment, let's just pretend
2213.44s: that this scenario didn't happen where we exited. And let's say that the stock just kept flying up.
2219.28s: It was just absolutely skyrocketing up. Well, here's what happens. If that occurs and let's say
2227.36s: that you had this six out, so you would have your 600 shares that you have for 10.5, you would sell
2237.60s: to close 600 of those and you would do it at $15. And then you would keep the entire premium.
2248.08s: So in this case, you would keep the credit of $69.90. So if you look at the $69.90 credit that you got,
2257.04s: plus the prior loss of $59.64 plus the prior win of $96, you notice that you still come out ahead.
2267.60s: You still made money. So what I'm showing you is that there's always an exit. If you're rolling
2274.00s: something, you're rolling something, it's keeping to going against you on the call side. You have the
2278.24s: shares and you're just tired of trying to roll and adjust it. You have an exit that's profitable.
2284.08s: You might be upset about it because you're like, well, shit, I'm selling them at $15.1 right now.
2288.16s: They're trading at $60. That does suck. But again, you still have another 400 shares that you got
2294.80s: at 10.5 that are now trading at $60. That's pretty cool. But if you take a look at the rest of this
2300.48s: example, we are actually able to maneuver through it. So to fast forward through the rest of this,
2307.84s: what we ended up doing was just clawing our way back slowly. So you can see we had the 15 strike
2316.64s: out in 19 July. We had six of those. We got those sold for $11.65. And again, you'll notice that
2323.12s: this is not a total credit here because we closed these at $15.45, but we sold these for $11.65.
2330.48s: How does this make sense? It's because we sold more of them. So if you take a look at the total
2339.12s: credit net credit here in this case, the way that I kind of tracked a math, this is
2344.80s: taking the total PNL of $59.64. As long as I take in more than $59.64 on this next trade,
2354.48s: I'm good. That's all I need. So in this case, because I'm selling more that allows me to have
2362.32s: a credit even though it's a lower premium and even though I'm able to move the basis by a dollar
2367.60s: that overwhelms the prior PNL, realized PNL. So we continue this process from 16 April, or 16 April,
2377.52s: 23 April, 13 May 19 June, or July 23 July, five, aug, 30, and then 11 November is when we're finally
2386.80s: able to exit. This is when we're essentially in total profit. Like we've made money, we're at
2393.60s: no risk anymore. We're good to just continue the process as per usual. So essentially from this
2401.68s: point on in 23 July is when we were able to get this flattened out so that we were down 15 bucks flat
2409.28s: and then we're able to just run standard programming from there. We can either maintain the size
2413.76s: if we want. We can scale the size down like we did here so that we don't have as many shares covered,
2420.40s: but you'll notice that I strategically use increasing the share sizes to give me bigger basis
2426.48s: adjustments. It's a slightly more aggressive approach. So this is the game that we play here.
2433.60s: Now one other thing I want to mention to you is this little break even requirements. Sometimes
2438.00s: people don't understand like let's say we're in this scenario here. Let's say we just realized the
2444.08s: loss of 5,964 bucks and we came in here and we sold six of the 19 July 15s for 11 65. This up here
2454.08s: tells me what I need this premium to be trading at in order to hit a break even. That's what this
2461.20s: tells me. So for example, we have the 11 65s. I just pull the data out of here. We pull the 11 65s
2469.36s: times the six lot. We weigh that against the realized PNL leading into it and this is using the
2477.60s: total PNL. We can use whatever PNL that we want. This tells me that I need these 11 65s for the
2485.04s: 15 strike 19 Julys that I sold for 11 65. I need those to be trading at $1.87 in order for this
2496.24s: to be a break even trade and I'll show you exactly what it looks like just so that it's clear.
2500.32s: I know that might sound weird. So I move this out of the way so that there's no noise. So what I'm
2505.12s: doing is I'm taking the PNL from the prior two trades and again, we don't have to take this. We
2510.72s: can get rid of that. We can just say that we want to use this the 59 64. So let's do that minus 59 64
2518.32s: and we're doing that because we're saying well, we put this into more shares. So this isn't even
2522.72s: there. So 59 64 in this case, we have that role that we talked about six of these 15 19 Julys.
2533.36s: We sold them for 11 65. We need them to be trading at $1.71 in order for these two trades
2540.72s: essentially to cancel out. So let's try that. So let's type in $1.71. So let's pretend that's where we
2545.68s: closed and voila. Notice how the sum is now zero. So if you're curious how to calculate this,
2555.12s: all I'm doing is taking the relationship. Well, let me see if I get this out of the way.
2560.80s: Taking the relationship between the realized PNL of whatever I'm trying to overcome. And I'm
2567.68s: taking that against the lot size and the premium for an adjusted net credit for the other trade.
2574.72s: So let's work through it literally step by step. I'm taking the lot size times the premium for the
2580.24s: role trade that gives me again, what I call an adjusted net credit. I'm adding that to the loss
2586.24s: from the prior trade divided by 100 kind of puts it in a per lot basis or in a standard options
2592.80s: contract basis. And then I divide the whole thing by the number of lots so that I know exactly
2599.28s: what I need each single contract to be trading at. Because again, when you look at an options
2604.16s: chain, it's not going to show the options chain in the context of you having six lots. It's going
2608.24s: to show it in one lot instances. So that's what that does. So I know that's a lot, but I hope
2614.40s: it's helpful. As always, we can go further into detail on this. We can talk some other techniques if
2619.92s: you'd like, or we can move on to the next strategy. I have in the docket for us, which is a ratio
2626.16s: called diagonal that I think fits into this thing very well as well, although a slightly different
2630.96s: use case a little more active of a management approach. So that's the game plan using GameStop is a
2636.40s: really fun example to talk through these things. These are my strategies. This is essentially what I
2640.56s: do. So this is the ratio covered call elements of a covered strangle, which always goes together for
2646.80s: me. So let me know if you have any questions being out there. I'll see you all later.
