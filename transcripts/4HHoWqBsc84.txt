0.00s: Just quick market update. I got three things on the agenda as you can tell. It's a little
5.04s: bit dark. I'm on the mobile setup. I'm actually hanging out right by Central Park getting
10.04s: ready to fly back to San Diego, but wanted to wrap the week up with you all because it
13.60s: was a little bit going on. And I did a video after the Fed rate release on Wednesday, which
18.56s: is pretty interesting. And today we got some new data. So I want to talk about the market
23.56s: as a whole. And then I want to talk about Tesla, GameStop and Novo. Those would be the
28.10s: main tickers we're going to dive into. So first things first, from a broad market perspective,
33.66s: it looks like we're still in this rotation phase I've talked about. We can see broader
39.46s: breadth indicators like net highs lows for cues for New York Stock Exchange, still rolling
45.74s: over even expanding still to the downside. Advanced decline cumulative average, negative
50.78s: sloping on a 50 period moving average. And just starting to take up a little bit, VIX
56.12s: is down some that may note here is it's just rotation. Like we're seeing names rebounding
62.54s: a little bit. This is actually one of the best possible times to go through and see which
68.10s: names are not participating within the sector level rebounds because it can help you find
74.06s: short ideas, things that are showing weakness. The other thing you can look for are things
78.22s: that didn't rebound quite as much as others. So you can see that in effect across the board,
84.42s: there is stuff like XLK had a really strong rally today. There's other names that didn't
90.14s: quite rally as much like XLE energy still showing weakness. So lots of interesting ideas
94.84s: out there as per usual. But yeah, I think I want to spend a little more time just talking
101.30s: about what the market is seeing writ large. So we can see today that the market had a bit
108.74s: of an emotional roller coaster and PCE, which is a really big inflation gauge for the
114.62s: Fed. It's actually a little bit light and we can see that it's 2.4% on annual basis
121.38s: compared to 2.5. That was massive. And this is essentially what fueled most of the rally
127.56s: today because we saw the Fed not all that long ago once they saying that they're probably
132.54s: going to roll out rate cuts a little slower. And the market doesn't like that because the
138.86s: market is looking for instant gratification, kind of like a kid looking for a sugar high.
143.66s: And they want all the good stuff right now. The problem obviously with doing something
147.46s: like that is it but it's a lot of issues further down the line. So we can see PCE really
155.54s: came in a little bit light. I mean, it's still unabashedly elevated. But it's getting
160.98s: closer and closer to some of the Fed target rates, which I think is quite telling. But
168.14s: I think it reinforces some of the Fed's point that they are probably going to approach
173.54s: future cuts a little more cautiously. And we looked at the probability for a cut. Actually,
177.62s: let's do that really quick because we didn't do this on the livestream tonight after PCE
183.02s: came out. And I'm actually curious what this is. So let's give it to this. Yeah. So still
188.78s: overwhelming probability of no change on 29 Jan and very little change over yesterday.
196.94s: But then out to a week ago, it's up massively from a 78% chance. So we have to keep an eye
204.58s: on this. So yeah, the market itself is still hyper hyper sensitive to inflation as we
211.70s: expect. So I think the name of the game here is position smartly. I'm finding a lot of
219.98s: opportunity with individual names that have been bucking this overall trend for upside
225.34s: trades. And then I've already talked about the main thesis to the downside and stuff like
230.18s: energy just because it's been there's nothing shocking about that. It's an easy, easy
235.34s: find. So let's now pivot to a few of the tickers that we want to talk about. Actually, I'm
241.90s: sorry, one thing before that. I want to show you this. So the advanced decline is actually
247.94s: showing a little bit of strength today. New York Stock Exchange had 74% advancing NASDAQ
252.62s: had 63%. But take a look at the highs and lows. We had 19 52 week highs on NIC 37 on NASDAQ.
262.90s: And then 139 52 week lows against 196 52 week lows. So even though stuff rebounded today
270.18s: had an advancing day, the overall tenor is still weakness. So the market is going to have
277.82s: to gain a footing before I would start adding a bunch of risk as mentioned to you all before
283.22s: on when's the actually paired down a lot of risk in things like the coverage strangle
287.94s: leverage ETFs and whatnot. It's it's really not necessarily knowing that this is going to
292.86s: happen. You never know when it's going to happen, but it's an evaluative, first reward
296.54s: relationship between the probabilities of things happening and then what the impact would
301.86s: be. So let's pivot over now and let's take a look at a few names because one of them that
309.62s: stuck out to me was Tesla because Tesla has been on an absolute tear yet we can clearly
318.06s: see Tesla is slowing down a little bit and this looks more in terms of participation with
324.66s: the broader market. But notice how Tesla did not rally today and the rest of the market
328.74s: did that to me indicates that this is starting to get to an extreme level that people are
335.14s: starting to say like, okay, I think this is ran up quite a lot, take some profit here,
339.30s: get some money off the table. So I think Tesla really needs to consolidate some before
344.06s: unless it has new news. If it has new news, it's a different story, but either new news
349.22s: or probably consolidation will look to be on the docket here. And let's take a look at
354.22s: the options chain here. We can see it's 4.5 million calls against 4.7 on the put side.
362.34s: There's 2 million calls traded today, 1.7 million puts. So it's still like put selling
370.18s: looks to be what I'm seeing here. This might be people cashing in on puts that they've
375.02s: bought near highs or this could be people that are starting to think that we could be getting
379.34s: near a value area selling puts to try to take on assignment if they're assigned or just
384.50s: collecting the credit on the down move because volatility will kick up a little bit. Lots
387.82s: of potentials there. And then a call side looks mostly like closures, at least definitively.
392.30s: The most typically will transact between the market, which we can't definitively tell
397.38s: if it was bought or sold. So let's take a quick look just at the overall volume today,
402.94s: the expiration's yeah, super short term. So the most of the volume today was for 20
408.42s: days and that's likely people collecting whatever value they can out of those options
413.02s: before rolling them out. So no big surprise there. Let's take a quick look at Novo. And
420.82s: this is interesting because this has to do with their weight loss drug. So they have
425.70s: a weight loss drug that was prospectively going to help people lose like 30% of their
433.18s: body weight. And it didn't necessarily come in in line with expectations. Let me pause
439.46s: this real quick and see if I can get this thing to load. Which is dumb and had it an extra
444.38s: oh and they're back. So you can see Novo here at drop down from one and four to 81. And
453.06s: this has everything to do with this trial information. So you can see here I've read through
457.66s: this yet. Let me see. Here goes for more than a year is told the world that expects patients
464.26s: to lose at least 25% of their body weight. Okay, so 25 sorry, not 30 on experimental drug
469.90s: Kagrasima. It turns out the company was wrong on Friday. They released results of a
474.46s: phase three trial. Patients only lost 22.7% which seems actually pretty close of their
480.70s: body weight on average after about a year and a half. There's some wrinkles in the data
484.90s: that suggest a drug could be better than it looks. They still plan to ask regulators to
489.50s: approve the medicine, but that 22.7% rate is about the same efficacy as Z bound the Eli
496.10s: Lily, which is the main thing here because if we take a look, there's a battle going on
501.10s: between these guys and Eli Lily and Eli Lily also had a pretty big down day today. I
506.66s: don't I would have expected them maybe to rally a little bit more, but they had other
510.06s: stuff going on themselves. So interesting movements between these the drift potential
518.06s: specifically for NVO for Novo is not insignificant. So I try to keep a pretty close eye on the
526.06s: options chain for stuff like this because a lot of people will know these results before
531.74s: they come out. And the other thing is the again, the ability for these results to drift
538.38s: forward now for at least some time or not insignificant. So you can see in the 17 Jan,
543.78s: there's 76,000 calls against 85,000 puts. So there's probably some people playing a little
549.38s: bit of drift, which is I think pretty smart. The little early because it also has earnings
555.70s: coming up, but the trade to the downside on that news is decent. I see what's going on
560.78s: there. And then last thing we have to take a look at is GameStop. And it's because we have
563.98s: an expiration today, the stock closed at 2982, which is pretty solid. Max Payne did move.
570.10s: And as always, it's I served that as a reminder because a lot of people, the emphasis on Max Payne
579.70s: sometimes can be a little bit excessive, I think. And sometimes we can forget that like the
583.98s: stock can also move on its own for for people wanting to get in and out. Now again, last
590.74s: Friday, I think it's a slightly different case because the probability of that being attributed
596.50s: to a couple of other things is pretty high. But this looks like normal stock movement.
601.58s: And the fact that this stock is hovering up like this is huge. If you take a look at
605.82s: the rally, 2.83% on the day, which is really, really solid, this, it just looks good, right?
611.42s: We're seeing higher lows slow ascent, which I like to see implied volatility is pretty high.
617.70s: So implied volatility is 117 and volatility percentile 61%. So pretty high on a relative basis.
625.98s: Now, if we poke through the options chain, 872,000 calls against 299 on the put side.
633.74s: So call skew is expanding pretty massively. So this is almost at three times calls to puts.
643.10s: That starts to get interesting to me. This very frequently will hover one and a half to two
647.38s: and a quarter times calls to puts. But three starts to be in anomaly specifically for GameStop.
655.22s: And we can see there's a ton of calls that were bought today and a lot of puts that were sold today.
661.66s: So if we break down the volume for today, we can see that the overall bulk, probably what the 30s here.
668.70s: And that's, you see, 30s. And that's because they were going to be out of the money.
674.26s: So that's probably a ton of people that were grabbing what they could out of them.
678.98s: And then rolling them out in time. But let's take a look at the next expiration cycle 67 to 12.
687.22s: So really big skew, but small numbers overall. 3j is super quiet. 10j and very quiet with 17j.
694.02s: 17j is 37 again, 6. That's massive as well. So the volume is definitely centering again in these run
702.30s: expiration with 2070s, taking up a little bit more than expected.
706.54s: And if we take a look at the volatility surface, let's take a look at 17j and like fab.
717.18s: So we see a little bit of inversion. And then it looks like we're back to put skew or 17j and but call skew on 21fab, which is interesting.
728.78s: So I'm, we got to keep an eye if the far out of the money's on GME call side for the 17j and start to take up a little bit,
737.02s: because that seems a little bit low. That just means that the market isn't necessarily pricing these as rich,
741.66s: which it tends to do and it's starting to price the downside a little bit more richly, which can kind of inform positioning a little bit.
748.54s: And then the last thing I want to mention with GameStop is I'm actually modeling now a covered strangle position in GameStop.
757.14s: So that's going to be, I think it's going to be I'm going to model a $10,000 trade on trading the coverage strangle in GameStop.
764.74s: And the purpose behind this is we did a poll on one of the live streams asking like what the average size was for GameStop.
771.42s: And people said like anything between like five and 10k. So I picked 10k and the plan now is to do updates on a covered strangle to show you how we can trade the equity, amplify it with options.
785.26s: So starting next week, I'll start sharing some updates on that. The position was established and all that it's up.
791.70s: So now it's time to run it, manage it and hopefully use it as a vector to help people learn not just about GameStop, but also how to use options to amplify positions, not just equity themselves, because especially something like GameStop, it's really useful, I think, and I tested it quite a lot at this point.
810.34s: So as always, anything you want me to take a look at, hit me up, throw it in the comments, shoot me an email, hit me up on X anything.
817.98s: I love taking a look at what you guys want me to talk about what you guys are interested in. It gives me a lot of focus.
823.02s: So thank you for sending that stuff in as you guys want me to look at stuff.
826.70s: Be an outlier. I'll see you all in.
