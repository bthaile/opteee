0.08s: let's start with a hot take the perfect
2.60s: options trade is not about whether or
6.20s: not the trade itself makes money I know
8.84s: actually the annoying part here is some
11.20s: of the worst possible trades make money
14.84s: so what is the perfect options trade
16.64s: that's what we're going to talk about so
17.92s: the thing to keep in mind is a good
20.36s: trade is not about luck it's about
22.84s: Precision it's about timing and we're
25.24s: going to talk about those two concepts
27.76s: along with how we structure a trade
30.76s: what's up everyone Eric here welcome
32.32s: back to the outliers let's get right in
34.00s: so we're going to talk about a few
35.36s: principles then I'm going to go through
36.84s: this thing I call the big four trade
38.48s: process and then I'm going to walk you
40.08s: through specific decisions that have to
42.40s: be made in order to ensure the perfect
45.12s: options trade is placed so the very
47.72s: first principle I'm going to introduce
49.48s: you to is this idea of stacking strength
52.12s: when we're looking for trades it's
54.44s: common for us to see something that
56.56s: looks generally appealing and then to
59.00s: immediately try to f figure out how to
60.68s: put a trade on in it let's take a look
62.36s: at an example if we pop over to the
64.24s: platform pop into a scan let's take a
66.32s: look at this Lin I'm looking for stocks
69.20s: that are near 52 we highs that's all and
72.32s: let's say we want to trade a bullish
74.12s: thesis for whatever reason do I like
76.92s: this for a bullish thesis well if I look
79.68s: across a 6-month time frame it's going
81.56s: up that looks okay and then if I look in
83.64s: on a 3mon time frame it's going
85.36s: generally up that's also Okay then if I
87.32s: look in on a 30-day it starts to flatten
89.28s: out a little bit some of this is going
90.68s: to have to align with your timing your
92.88s: trading window that you're pursuing but
94.80s: let's take a look at something in
95.84s: comparison like xlc if I want to trade
98.24s: something to the upside this looks okay
101.28s: it's definitely moving up it doesn't
103.76s: have that big pullback like you're
105.56s: seeing in the linin stock that we were
108.32s: just looking at what I'm highlighting is
110.68s: we have to come up with multiple factors
113.56s: so the idea of stacking strength is to
117.08s: look at multiple factors all together in
121.00s: conjunction about not looking at one
123.24s: specific element in making a decision
125.56s: off of that one element it's a common
127.40s: mistake the other thing that we already
129.76s: discussed is that the perfect options
132.12s: trade is not outcome based it's not
134.04s: whether or not you make money the
135.56s: ultimate objective is to make money but
137.80s: you have to remember there will be some
139.48s: traders that are insanely lucky and they
142.60s: have one trade that makes them a ton of
145.20s: money and they're off to the racist
147.60s: they've made all their money they're
148.84s: good that's not the case for most people
150.84s: there's a healthy dose of luck that
152.68s: leads to that style of outcome so when
155.48s: we're looking at the path for most of us
157.88s: is we're going to have to trade a lot
159.04s: we're going to have to do it a lot over
160.84s: time that's the idea of making sure that
163.28s: we're not so focused on the outcome of
165.76s: an individual trade so that we're
167.36s: breaking all our rules doing things we
169.00s: know we shouldn't like letting losers
170.60s: get too big hoping that it turns around
172.56s: taking winning trades down too fast all
174.28s: these different kinds of things and we
175.72s: focus on are we putting on trades that
178.68s: follow our plan and our system that's
182.16s: the objective now that entire concept is
184.56s: predicated on having a system that
186.76s: you're confident in because one of the
188.44s: most common reasons for somebody to
190.08s: break a plan is that they don't trust
192.00s: the plan why would you follow a plan
193.84s: that you don't trust doesn't make any
195.32s: sense so the work in trading is done in
198.80s: building a plan that you trust that's
200.24s: where all the rigor goes so if we have a
202.72s: plan that we trust and we understand
204.72s: that we're not so concerned about the
207.16s: outcome of any one individual trade
209.48s: because because we trust the plan and
211.36s: over time it leads to profitable results
213.68s: then it's easier to focus on this key
216.12s: principle of focusing on making sure
217.92s: that we're putting on trades that align
219.56s: with our plan and are not
222.12s: overemphasizing the outcome of anyone
224.48s: individual trade the last General
226.64s: principle is looking for nodes I find
228.88s: traders in general they go through this
230.72s: process and essentially they're trying
232.76s: to come up with different ways to make
235.08s: something make sense to put it on I look
236.96s: at it in the inverse I want to look for
239.44s: things that as I go through my screening
241.76s: criteria that there's no logical reason
244.12s: for me to not place the trade I find a
246.68s: lot of Traders are trying to find an
248.64s: excuse something is in this steep sharp
251.32s: Decline and they're like well it might
252.72s: turn around I I want to get in now or it
255.08s: might go lower who really knows but the
257.76s: idea of trying to build a trade premise
261.12s: off of essentially confirmation bias
263.40s: trying to see the things that you want
264.72s: to see for something to go up is a
266.72s: terrible terrible habit so I flip that
268.64s: on its head and I look for reasons to
270.96s: say no and if there are too many reasons
272.92s: that lead me or that lead to no then
275.04s: it's no trade that's simple let's talk
276.96s: about the big four trade process this is
278.88s: in a couple different videos so I'm
280.16s: going to gloss over this quickly but
282.00s: when we're placing the perfect options
283.76s: trade in my opinion it follows this
286.08s: exact process we're going to start by
287.84s: assessing portfolio fit is this
290.08s: something are we looking for something
291.80s: that fits a specific need for our
293.92s: portfolio do we need long Deltas short
295.88s: Deltas do we need Theta do we need more
297.88s: gamma whatever it is or are we simply
300.52s: looking for opportunities this origin
303.28s: matters a lot because for example if I'm
305.52s: looking for a trade I need long Deltas
307.92s: in my portfolio but then I come across
309.96s: this really great short Delta trade it
312.92s: might look like a great trade but if it
314.60s: doesn't fit the portfolio it doesn't fit
316.40s: the portfolio so this is the foundation
318.68s: for then looking and identifying things
321.40s: that make sense so the next part is
323.84s: clearly articulating The Profit
326.32s: mechanism and the corresponding signals
328.68s: for that trade so we're going through
330.56s: this process we're trying to stack
331.80s: strength we're not focused on the
333.72s: outcome too much we're focused on the
335.48s: process we're ready to look for nose
337.28s: we're going through our portfolio and we
338.84s: find ah we don't really need anything
340.88s: anything that looks really good to us
342.52s: looks good to us so then we start
344.08s: scanning we look for things that look
346.04s: appealing and we find something that
348.28s: catches our eye for example let's take a
351.48s: look at red fin red Fin's been going
353.96s: down maybe this is a short thesis we
355.96s: think that this is something that's
356.96s: going to go down well depending on the
358.52s: time frame that we think it might go
360.08s: down the very first thing I noticed is
361.84s: that on a 3mon standard deviation
363.80s: channel it's actually upward sloping
365.48s: that's not tremendously bearish to me so
367.84s: then if I zoom in a little bit further I
369.68s: go to 30 days it's still upward sloping
372.20s: so unless I'm looking to trade a really
374.68s: really short-term thesis like this is a
376.88s: 5day 5 minute all of a sudden it's
378.76s: definitely downward sloping so if it's a
380.68s: really shortterm thesis maybe it makes
382.44s: sense but when I'm looking for technical
384.92s: analysis I typically want to define the
386.80s: time frame I'm trying to trade and then
388.84s: look at one up one down in terms of the
391.44s: aggregation period so if I'm trading
392.96s: something that's super shortterm like
394.56s: maybe a couple days well then sure I can
396.60s: use the 5 day 15 minute then I could
399.16s: maybe use a shorter term time frame a 1
401.32s: day 5 minute and see how the overall
403.76s: strength or weakness is shaping up and
405.80s: then I can do something a little bit
406.88s: longer term a few weeks or a month and
408.60s: see how it looks in that period so if we
410.96s: look at this 30-day period it's the
413.20s: period that I'm looking to trade here is
415.08s: definitely negative sloping but it's
416.72s: still within a broader uptrend so that
418.84s: is a no and it's an objective no in
421.60s: terms of alignment across all these
423.60s: different time frames does that mean
424.84s: that there's no trade potential no there
426.56s: still could be but it's something I have
427.96s: to take into consideration as I evaluate
430.36s: this against other opportunities The
432.32s: Profit mechanism in that case is very
434.00s: very clear it's short term bearish
437.04s: Direction it's a continuation of a trend
439.64s: so then understanding The Profit
441.36s: mechanism and the signals allows me to
443.76s: do this next step which is build the
446.40s: trade I'm going to build a trade that
447.84s: makes sense off of these things so for
450.24s: example if I'm trading something that's
452.56s: bearish Direction it naturally funnels
454.80s: me into a couple strategies maybe short
456.48s: calls long puts and then depending on
458.52s: what I think the potential price
459.80s: activity looks like for that underlying
461.68s: so for example if we go back and let's
464.04s: say that I think that the potential here
465.76s: is there's potential for a massive move
467.96s: for whatever reason let's just say I
469.16s: think that to be the case if I think
470.60s: that as the case and there's a massive
472.40s: move well then what I prefer short calls
475.08s: or long puts I would prefer long puts
477.48s: because I have uncapped profit potential
479.80s: so if you follow this kind of process
481.84s: you're making sure everything is in
484.52s: alignment and then the last step here is
486.32s: just to make sure that we have an after
487.92s: action review this is where we look
490.44s: through and we already know the
492.20s: information and details we want to
494.24s: collect to make sure that we are
496.68s: following our plan to make sure that the
498.20s: plan is good to make sure that the plan
499.68s: makes sense all of those get captured
502.36s: and tracked in the a so what are the
504.72s: decisions that have to be made really
506.32s: simple it's this list here we run
508.56s: through all of these different key
510.76s: decisions as we're deciding what exactly
514.36s: the trade should behave in terms of our
517.00s: interaction with it over the life cycle
519.04s: and that's what leads to the perfect
521.88s: options trade it's something that's
523.48s: completely aligned with our portfolio
525.40s: that we clearly articulate The Profit
527.24s: mechanisms as signals that we build a
529.12s: trade based on a strategy that we have a
531.64s: plan for and tested and we know it works
534.12s: and then we have a plan to integrate all
536.12s: of the data into an after action review
538.88s: so that we can track what worked well
540.52s: what didn't work well and modify our
542.64s: systems as needed going forward we're
544.36s: going to stack strength we're not going
545.88s: to focus on the outcome of individual
547.64s: trades too heavily we're not going to
549.24s: sit there and break all our rules to try
550.64s: to salvage an individual trade we're
552.52s: going to look for nose and we're going
553.92s: to find opportunities that look so good
556.68s: that we can't say no this is the perfect
558.40s: options trade in my view this is not
560.24s: talking about a trade that just
561.40s: automatically goes your direction and
562.84s: looks beautiful the whole time it's not
564.48s: about whether or not the trade makes
565.68s: money it's about following a process
568.12s: that we know yield positive expected
570.76s: return over time and continuing to do
573.00s: that be an outlier see youall later
