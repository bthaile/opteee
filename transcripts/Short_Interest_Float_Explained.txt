0.71s: everybody Eric here got another really
3.84s: good question there's a bunch of them
4.95s: today so this is actually really
6.00s: engaging it's awesome quiet folks are
8.49s: you know trying to learn and you know
10.11s: I'm happy to help so the question is
13.26s: wrapped around you know what is short
16.20s: interest flow in how can we use it to
18.90s: help us inform our investing decisions
21.90s: great question
23.25s: so first and foremost short interest
26.76s: float short shares short interest short
30.33s: float all of it is synonymous so when
32.85s: we're having this conversation I likely
34.47s: will flow in between all of them but
37.14s: it's essentially it all means the same
38.94s: thing and what it means is it's how many
41.91s: shares have been sold short so as most
45.42s: folks know and familiar you can buy
48.12s: stock normally when you buy stock you
50.64s: want it to appreciate and value so that
53.55s: you can sell higher so buy low sell high
56.84s: there's a entire other side of stock
60.93s: transactions where people can sell short
64.01s: where they typically do that in a
66.99s: bearish sentiment where they think it's
69.18s: going to go down so in that instance
71.64s: what they do is they don't own any
74.28s: shares to start they borrow shares from
78.06s: a broker and they tell the broker I owe
81.36s: you X number of shares however many they
84.15s: borrowed and then what that investor
86.58s: would do is immediately sell those
88.23s: shares so technically they would have
92.34s: negative X number of shares after they
95.16s: sell the shares because they need to
98.16s: recoup those shares at some point to
100.26s: give back to the broker so what they
103.59s: want is to sell them at a high price and
106.29s: then buy them back at a low price and
109.77s: then as soon as they get those shares
111.81s: back they just give them to the broker
113.55s: say here you go thanks for letting me
115.53s: borrow these and then that's the trade
117.54s: so inverse to traditional stock
121.95s: investing they sell high and then buy
126.12s: low so the reason why we like to you
130.50s: know take a look at short interest float
132.21s: is because it
133.74s: identify sentiment in the market and the
136.95s: reason being is if you see a certain
139.47s: stock that has a ton of shares short
144.93s: shares there is a good chance that a lot
147.54s: of institutional investors who do a lot
149.55s: of research on this stuff it's their
151.68s: jobs are identifying this is something
154.41s: that they feel is going to decrease
157.08s: I never you know promulgate the herd
161.52s: mentality just follow kind of mindset
164.07s: but we can use it as an indicator to add
166.53s: to the rest of our toolkit so if we're
169.20s: looking at something we're like oh you
170.76s: know this one looks a little weird it
171.90s: might come down and then all of a sudden
173.82s: you see that there's a really really
175.38s: large number of short shares that can be
177.72s: you know a tool that you use including
179.97s: with your thought process so there's a
182.31s: couple ways it can be expressed first
184.14s: just a general number of shares more
186.60s: often than not what's more helpful is
188.55s: when you see it expressed as a
189.72s: percentage and to get that percentage
191.40s: you know pretty simply just take the
193.11s: number of short shares and then divide
194.97s: it by the shares outstanding and that'll
196.56s: give you you know 20% of outstanding
199.59s: shares are short you know something like
201.63s: that
201.84s: just to give you an idea of you know the
204.57s: size a couple of the things that I think
207.84s: are worth discussing the short interest
210.54s: ratio is it's a good one to follow and
213.96s: the reason being it's also known as the
217.17s: dates to cover ratio and the calculation
219.36s: is short interest divided by the average
221.49s: daily volume so if you could probably
223.44s: infer from the calculation what this is
226.05s: telling you how many days it takes it
228.18s: would take on a how many average days it
231.78s: would take for shorts to cover their
233.79s: position so for example if there's a
236.40s: product that has you know an average
239.34s: daily volume of 10 million shares and
242.73s: then there's 5 million shares that are
245.76s: sold short over that over an average day
249.77s: you can close all those shorts all those
252.12s: shorts would have enough volume to close
253.56s: however in that same a same scenario if
257.31s: we have 10 million average daily shares
261.03s: and then there's 40 million in short
264.21s: interest that means that it would take
266.52s: at least
267.36s: four days for them to cover all of their
270.18s: short positions that can be a problem if
273.36s: the market is running up and people are
276.27s: trying to get out of these positions
277.77s: from the short side you can see a lot of
279.93s: flight to quality people just you know
281.55s: just trying to get the heck out of these
283.05s: positions and it can create volatility
285.84s: so that's an interesting one to follow
287.67s: if you see a you know a big disparity in
289.98s: that ratio it's something I like to
291.87s: watch the last piece I'm sure you've
295.02s: heard of it in some capacity at some
296.67s: point is the good old squeeze also known
299.07s: as the short squeeze what this is is
301.47s: when you have a bunch of people that's
304.14s: shorter the position remember when you
307.02s: short you want it to go down however if
309.98s: you short and it continues up and
313.68s: continues up and continues up at some
317.10s: point you once you hit your risk profile
319.71s: a lot of people are like up you know hit
322.20s: my risk time to sell in this case time
324.87s: to buy time to close the position is
327.30s: what it means so if they you know sold
329.61s: at $50 and it keeps going up keeps going
332.73s: up now it's at 70 and they're like okay
334.92s: I got to buy this back I know it's going
336.42s: to be a $20 loss to share but I got to
338.28s: get out of this thing and then all of a
340.95s: sudden a couple days later once all
343.02s: those shorts get out then the market
345.15s: normalizes it comes back down it's a
348.00s: short squeeze so it's a temporary
349.50s: increase or decrease depending on if
352.23s: it's a short squeeze or Bowl squeeze but
355.05s: it's a temporary move in the price that
357.87s: normalizes shortly thereafter
360.03s: now on the short side it can it can
363.99s: absolutely be a good opportunity for for
369.57s: bullish investors if there's a large
371.52s: short interest flow and most people are
374.46s: like how can that be if you know you're
378.00s: just telling me that it could mean that
380.25s: there's a lot of bearish sentiment and
382.19s: professionals think it's going to go
383.79s: down goes back to what I say all the
385.71s: time nobody knows what the hell is going
386.91s: to happen nobody knows
388.26s: we have people who it's their explosive
389.79s: job to try to you know analyze different
392.61s: underlyings and you know come out within
394.92s: a hypothesis on direction and they're
397.17s: wrong all the time so it comes to 50
400.41s: the chance so the reason why it can be
403.17s: an opportunity risky but can be is
406.71s: because again that similar squeeze
410.61s: scenarios if all of a sudden there's no
413.64s: pullback and all these shorts are trying
416.13s: to cover their positions remember how do
419.79s: you cover a short position you have to
421.89s: buy stock so whenever we buy stock we're
426.09s: increasing demand demand increases price
430.47s: increases exactly so it's just if a
433.35s: bunch of shorts start trying to cover
436.02s: their positions they're buying a bunch
438.21s: of stock which is going to drive price
440.40s: up so if you're bullish and you sit and
442.92s: you see a trend continue you know to the
445.50s: upside it could be a good investment
447.27s: because there's a chance that the shorts
450.03s: will end up wanting to get out and then
451.95s: driving the price up if enough of them
454.05s: start to do so so that's what short
456.78s: interest float is a couple actionable
458.64s: items from an investing perspective on
460.35s: how we can you know use this to inform
462.06s: some of our decision-making I would
464.16s: never use any of this as the basis for a
466.65s: trade but I do use a lot of this
468.87s: information to assist in you know my
471.60s: trade generation ideas it's a tool in
474.75s: the toolkit it's not you know the
476.67s: end-all be-all so hope this is helpful
478.86s: I'll catch you guys later
