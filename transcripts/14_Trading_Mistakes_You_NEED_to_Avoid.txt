0.04s: I've been trading for 16 years that
2.16s: means I have made a ton of mistakes over
6.28s: my trading career the goal of this video
8.48s: is to walk you through 14 of these and
11.40s: there's a specific thing I want you to
13.08s: keep in mind during the video which is
15.64s: how many of these honestly do you
18.52s: identify with I'm curious for two
20.64s: reasons the first one is I'm curious how
23.04s: well people can objectively evaluate
25.36s: their own performance but then the
26.84s: second thing is I'm curious how far
29.40s: along you are in your trading journey
32.48s: and how many of these things you've seen
34.44s: because the goal of the video is to walk
36.84s: you through how you can overcome each of
39.96s: these mistakes what's up everybody Eric
42.16s: here welcome back to the outliers shout
43.72s: out to the patreon family consider
45.32s: signing up let's get right to it we have
47.24s: the first five right here and logically
50.64s: we'll start with number one trading has
52.76s: a deceptively low barrier to entry so I
57.40s: use the example of a martial artist of a
60.00s: Surfer something that's a skilled
61.88s: Behavior welder whatever the punchline
65.12s: is when you see somebody that's really
67.16s: good at what they do they make it look
69.44s: easy meanwhile when you first start
72.36s: doing that thing yourself you actually
74.64s: realize how hard it is it's called a
77.12s: skill Gap it's when you falsely perceive
80.36s: the difference between where somebody
82.16s: who's really good at it is and where you
84.28s: are the reason why this is such a
86.28s: problem in trading is because anybody
88.72s: can start trading all you have to do is
90.60s: open up a brokerage account and then
92.24s: obviously if you look at any social
94.00s: media apparently everybody's always
96.20s: making boatloads of money somehow
99.00s: magically and it's really defining your
103.16s: mental approach to the markets which is
104.92s: a giant problem the markets are
107.72s: difficult the people that are really
109.16s: good at this stuff make it look easy
111.28s: it's not it takes time to pick it up I
114.24s: like to use the analogy of if you going
116.88s: to climb Mount Everest you have to
118.92s: acknowledge the Mountain itself it's the
121.40s: same thing in trading if you want to be
122.84s: a successful Trader long term you got to
124.60s: get ready to climb that mountain number
126.28s: two most people I know myself included
129.16s: when it comes to trading we have a just
132.12s: halfhazard approach what this means is
134.68s: think about this if you learned anything
136.92s: in school how did that process go you go
139.12s: in the first day you get an outline of
141.12s: some sort a syllabus then on that
143.36s: syllabus you're going to see all the
144.56s: different topics you're going to learn
146.00s: that are in a logical order there's
147.64s: going to be some sort of homework
148.96s: associated projects tests all of which
151.48s: culminate in a Grade that evaluates your
154.16s: proficiency on mastering that topic that
156.52s: doesn't happen in trading you just start
158.32s: trading and the problem with that is
160.52s: most people do kind of shoddy homework
162.84s: most people aren't testing themselves
165.00s: objectively the issue you run into this
167.20s: is you kind of have a really skewed
169.04s: perception and a really poor learning
171.24s: path with one of the most complex
173.48s: systems I can think of an algebra
175.64s: equation has a Defined answer a lot of
177.92s: stuff in the stock market is working
179.64s: with with imperfect information risking
182.36s: Capital so the note here is when you
185.60s: decide to start learning to trade create
188.24s: a learning path for yourself one of the
190.12s: things I recommend for options Traders
191.80s: is to pick up a copy of options as a
194.28s: strategic investor I'm not affiliated
196.52s: with Lawrence McMillan at all Larry's a
198.44s: great dude but he wrote a great Tome
201.20s: about options trading that serves as
204.04s: that structure source for you next one
207.28s: kind of already hit on this markets are
209.24s: multivar perod essentially innumerable
211.56s: you can't even count all of the inputs
213.80s: that the stock market has this is just a
215.40s: Russell 2000 and if you think about it
217.76s: each one of these is an individual
219.24s: company trying to do its business with
221.48s: all of its own little details associated
223.64s: with it and there's interdependencies
225.16s: between them and it just grows out to
227.24s: this massive quite literally global
229.84s: scale there's a lot going on here so the
232.24s: idea that you're going to just somehow
235.16s: bounce around picking up the right
236.92s: things magically and memorize it all
238.88s: because most people don't have a trading
241.12s: plan or a trading log is wild just as if
245.00s: you go to school you have a notebook
246.88s: that you take notes in you need
248.68s: something to take notes in whether you
250.72s: build out that trading plan to serve
252.76s: that purpose or to brainstorm ideas you
255.04s: need to write your thoughts down
256.52s: otherwise you're going to be all over
257.80s: the place the next one here is
260.56s: completely perverting how we actually
263.44s: make money in the stock market I call
265.32s: them money making mechanisms and if you
268.00s: think about asking a Trader how do you
269.76s: make money in the stock market a lot of
271.12s: them say like oh I day trade well you
273.24s: can day trade and lose money so no that
276.64s: doesn't inherently make money what makes
279.44s: money things like being good at trading
283.52s: directionally whether it's up or down
285.88s: being good at trading volatility being
289.12s: good at picking good strong stocks that
291.60s: receive dividends or being good at
294.24s: picking companies that appreciate in
296.72s: value over time it's kind of like
298.68s: trading Direction but on a longer time
301.00s: frame the point being is it's really
303.00s: important to decouple the actual forces
305.72s: that make money versus the way you
307.88s: attempt to capture those forces via what
310.24s: products whether you trade options
311.96s: equities if you trade bonds or your
314.44s: methodology whether you're a day trader
316.08s: swing Trader options Trader Futures
317.68s: Trader Yad y yada learn what makes money
321.20s: then find ways to capitalize on that
324.52s: next up this is a really hard pill to
327.28s: swallow for people I started with a
329.20s: small account myself back in 2007 and
332.08s: right now I did a study and well I
334.12s: looked up the data in this scenario and
335.92s: the average Robin Hood account is
337.40s: $33,000 very small account the problem
339.92s: here is that if you're trying to trade
341.32s: with a $3,000 account you are making a
344.12s: ton of concessions right out of the gate
346.16s: you can't even sell Naked options on a
348.16s: bunch of things because you don't have
349.28s: enough money you don't have things like
350.84s: portfolio margin you're also going to be
353.04s: flagged as a day trader all of these
355.52s: different things lead you into this box
358.36s: that really forces you to trade certain
360.56s: structures that they might be all you
363.08s: have access to just because you have
366.32s: access to it doesn't mean it's optimal
369.92s: you have to understand that rarely is a
373.28s: vertical spread optimal in any sense
376.60s: there are times where it might be
377.84s: applicable but if you have to trade
379.68s: verticals cuz your account is small fine
381.52s: so be it that is what it is but don't
383.64s: delude yourself into thinking that this
385.76s: is a good strategy that you're really
388.12s: able to scale over time what you'll find
390.04s: is most experienced Traders move away
391.92s: from verticals as soon as humanly
393.92s: possible specifically when we're talking
396.08s: about options next grouping when I see
399.00s: new Traders this is a common
401.40s: misconception here we have this Trader
403.20s: that is successful after 13 months of
406.52s: trading and you know they just want to
409.40s: acknowledge their dedication and
411.44s: hardship dog you've been trading for 13
414.04s: you haven't even started trading yet you
416.20s: literally this is the infancy of trading
419.60s: and what I mean by this is let's take a
421.36s: look at this example down here it's kind
422.80s: of blurry cuz it's squished down but
425.36s: here's the punchline if you take a look
427.40s: at this and you see that the last bare
429.80s: market right here was in 2009 and if you
433.92s: started trading after that you didn't
435.88s: see another bare market for 11 years 11
440.04s: years there's this reality about path
444.20s: path is how something moves from point A
447.44s: to B we know equities tend to exhibit
450.32s: positive drift where they go up over
451.88s: time but if you'll notice this chart of
453.64s: SPX over 10 years there's periods where
455.48s: it goes down and if you're trading
457.48s: something like this over here tle Q's I
460.00s: forget what time frame I tested this in
462.36s: but in whatever this nondescript time
464.20s: frame was it returned
466.36s: 39.5% however the path it took to get
470.20s: that 39.5% compound annual growth rate
472.96s: included a
475.20s: 79% draw down on your Capital so if you
478.88s: see something something that looks
480.28s: really really good and you don't
481.88s: acknowledge the path it might take to
484.08s: get there there's a good chance that
486.04s: path is going to slap you in the face
487.76s: and Shake you out of what you're
490.24s: doing oh wow the other thing is you
493.88s: cannot accept small samples in anything
496.60s: that you're doing if you're a Trader you
498.32s: should be back testing forward testing
500.68s: live testing those are non-negotiables
502.48s: in my opinion and if you think that
504.76s: you've got this figured out after 13
506.48s: months meanwhile you could have traded
508.32s: for 11 years years and not seen a a key
511.88s: Market condition a bare Market that's a
513.92s: giant problem and it's nobody's fault if
515.96s: you don't get a chance to see a bare
517.72s: Market over 11 years it's just a timing
519.88s: thing but that is a relic of the
522.28s: environment that we operate within and
523.92s: you have to acknowledge the shortfalls
525.52s: that this person even if they had traded
527.48s: for eight years they might have blown up
529.92s: their account trading the first bare
531.80s: Market they've ever seen because they
534.08s: reacted in a way that they didn't know
536.12s: because they've never seen this before
538.20s: that happens all the time time next up
540.52s: done and Krueger effect is kind of a
542.72s: contributing factor to what I consider
544.44s: to be the largest percent draw down of
546.60s: my account that happened actually after
548.84s: several years of trading for me and it's
550.84s: kind of like a learning curve where on
552.16s: the x- axis we have your proficiency and
554.88s: on the Y access you have your confidence
557.68s: how well you rate yourself at whatever
560.40s: the skill set is and you kind of start
562.00s: at a healthy spot you have no
563.80s: understanding and you know you know
564.88s: nothing this is perfect then you start
567.04s: trading for a little while you've been
568.36s: doing it for 5 years now so even though
570.76s: you started right in this Middle where
572.60s: we never even saw a bare Market you
574.52s: really feel like you know what's going
576.04s: on you got your feet under you you know
577.60s: it all at this point or you know most of
579.16s: it and then all of a sudden risk reveals
582.16s: itself in some way and then you kind of
584.04s: identify like oh I don't even know
585.88s: what I don't know yet this is dangerous
588.00s: this is where most of my audience comes
590.76s: into my world because I don't deal with
593.52s: these people too much because they're
595.36s: you can't talk to them because they're
597.16s: too bright-eyed bushy tailed they
598.52s: haven't seen enough yet but these are
600.12s: the people that are like okay this is
602.04s: kind of serious I think I can figure it
603.92s: out but I know I have a long way to go
606.80s: and then this is where the sustainable
609.32s: growth of the skill set occurs over time
612.12s: but just know if you've been trading for
614.20s: anything less than 5 years you don't
615.92s: know it yet you're figuring it out
617.60s: hopefully you're crushing it but don't
619.64s: get ahead of yourself because that's
621.60s: where mistakes happen it's where my
623.12s: largest mistake happened myself next
625.44s: this is a common disposition I see
627.80s: Traders where the look at something and
629.80s: they'll try to see like oh you know
631.68s: could this work could this be a good
633.40s: spot for my money and what I try to
635.36s: recommend to people at least the way I
636.80s: look at things when I'm looking at
638.28s: trades I'm looking for reasons to say no
640.76s: I'm not looking for reasons to say yes
643.40s: this is a key differentiator between how
646.32s: I look at markets and other people I'm
648.32s: looking for the best possible place to
651.48s: put my money not what could conceivably
654.56s: work and you'll see kind of an example
656.72s: about this in a few minutes the last
658.68s: thing here is a really great saying I
660.72s: love this it's strong convictions
662.80s: loosely held this means you go through a
665.08s: lot of effort to build a conviction in
667.48s: something that's based on a lot of
669.04s: research but you're receptive to new
671.88s: information you are willing to abandon
674.00s: your position as soon as you receive
676.56s: information that leads you to do so
678.80s: which means you are not getting
680.48s: entrenched in your argument this is so
683.68s: common because human nature is prone to
686.28s: get entrenched in our position and that
689.32s: really doesn't benefit you in trading
690.72s: you have to be willing to bounce around
692.60s: then we also have this kind of world
695.28s: where Traders really foro taking
698.28s: responsibility this is where you see
699.92s: things like YOLO Traders or Lotto
702.48s: Traders if it's a lotto you're supposed
704.08s: to lose the trade so if you lose it who
705.88s: cares that's just completely absolving
709.04s: yourself of ownership of that trade it's
712.16s: okay to speculate speculate it's okay to
713.96s: take highly speculative traits don't
715.84s: give yourself an out if you speculate
718.40s: and lose you didn't want to lose you
720.56s: messed up somewhere you weren't supposed
722.60s: to lose otherwise you wouldn't put the
724.04s: damn trade on so you got to abolish this
727.32s: kind of mindset from your approach in
729.32s: its entirety okay the last group here be
732.68s: a Trader this one is really simple in my
736.44s: opinion Traders all the time classify
738.64s: themselves I'm a day trader options
740.00s: Trader yada yada yada the punchline be a
742.28s: Trader be whatever Trader makes sense
745.40s: for what you're doing sometimes I'm a
747.56s: bullish Trader sometimes I'm a Trader
750.00s: sometimes I trade options sometimes I
751.48s: trade equities I trade whatever makes
754.36s: sense don't get wrapped up into
757.48s: identifying as a type of Trader just be
759.88s: a damn Trader next these are four losing
764.20s: habits and you've got to read the study
766.24s: it's called the behavior of individual
767.68s: investors I cite it all of the time
770.08s: there's a couple things you have to be
771.72s: aware of things like the disposition
773.92s: effect things like naive reinforcement
777.16s: these are your peers these are this is
779.28s: what's happening to all of the other
780.84s: swaths of Traders so if you want to be
783.12s: successful it's important to look at
784.92s: what successful people do it's also
786.60s: important to look at what unsuccessful
788.20s: people do and don't do that so for
790.08s: example disposition effect when we cut
792.28s: winning trades too short and we let
794.12s: winners run don't do that naive
796.76s: reinforcement this is where we focus on
798.88s: good experiences and try to block out
801.60s: the bad ones because your ego doesn't
803.36s: like that don't do that face the
806.08s: music next this is a really interesting
809.32s: thought process and I'm not sure a lot
810.92s: of people consider this there are
812.32s: multiple ways to beat the market you
814.60s: don't have to beat the Topline
816.56s: performance every single year to
818.16s: outperform the market I haven't done
820.40s: that but I have outperformed the market
822.64s: almost by two times plus over the last
825.16s: 16 years and it's by thinking through
828.72s: return path so for example portfolio 1
831.28s: over here it has a 7.4% average return
834.28s: portfolio 3 has an 88.6% average return
837.24s: portfolio 3 has a better return however
839.80s: portfolio 1 made more money 142,000
842.80s: versus 139 how it had a 1.4% worse
846.56s: return it's because it didn't have any
848.12s: big draw Downs didn't have any crazy
849.80s: great years the best year was 10% the
852.16s: worst positive positive year on this
854.48s: side was 12% but this one 25% draw down
858.08s: was all the difference so think about
859.88s: the different ways you can outperform
861.36s: the market it doesn't all have to be to
863.36s: the Top Line next you have to abolish
865.76s: your normal thought patterns this
867.28s: bargain buying thing where if you wanted
869.40s: to buy deodorant yeah buy that on sale
871.36s: makes total sense as a consumer you're
873.16s: taught to bargain hunt that's actually
875.32s: why marketing is so smart and everything
877.64s: is on sale all the time it's it's the
880.28s: value of Something's whatever the value
881.84s: is but those are just marketing Poes
883.48s: because everybody knows that's how
884.72s: you're wired to think about things where
886.60s: if it's on sale then you should buy it
888.16s: CU you're getting a good deal and that's
889.80s: part of your experience it's all
891.12s:  but in the markets it really
893.40s: doesn't work well because for example in
895.36s: Nvidia if you were waiting for a
897.48s: pullback because it's up too high and
899.32s: you wanted it on sale guess what you're
901.08s: still sitting on the sidelines then if
903.56s: it inadvertently has a big pullback
905.76s: you're like oh wow this is great I want
907.36s: to get in here well there's a reason why
909.44s: it's dropping at that point maybe it's
911.04s: not a great time to buy this is just one
913.32s: example other things like getting
915.36s: wrapped up in these new tools like
917.56s: options flow and dark pools and algo
920.56s: trading news flash retail Traders we are
923.48s: the tip of the tail of the dog by the
926.08s: time you're seeing this stuff it's been
927.60s: out for decades you can use these tools
930.36s: nothing wrong with that you're not going
931.68s: to find some sort of Crazy Edge in these
934.40s: kinds of things you still have to make
935.72s: it yourself the last one avoid simple
938.56s: explanations we went through a bunch of
940.20s: things here markets are complex we have
942.96s: a disposition to discreetly summarize
946.32s: things it is satiating to us we as
948.96s: humans want that to happen sometimes you
951.60s: can do that if a company has a great
953.28s: earnings release and then it skyrockets
955.16s: after earnings you could probably point
956.60s: at that and say yeah it went up because
958.44s: of earnings
959.44s: but never let that go too far because as
962.04s: soon as you start thinking that you can
