0.00s: Made a little over 30 grand in Tesla over the last couple days, but I also made a couple
5.82s: mistakes.
6.82s: So I want to talk about how I played this position so far and more importantly talk about
13.32s: the benefits and drawbacks about some of my trading strategies.
18.24s: I'm way more interested in identifying the issues with what I'm doing as compared to
23.68s: patting myself on the back and saying, oh yeah, you made some money.
26.44s: There's a long term game.
28.84s: So the goal is to walk you through the ratio called diagonal that I set up in the trade,
34.20s: how I found it, all those kinds of details because we had a question from the discord.
39.04s: Our good friend, GOC said, when exactly and why did you put the ratio called diagonal
46.56s: on in Tesla?
47.56s: This is from our discord.
49.28s: And I post about some of my stuff that I do once in a while in there and that's what
53.60s: they're asking about.
54.96s: And then the following questions is, what indicators, chart patterns, make you take
58.74s: a shot, those kinds of things.
60.28s: And we'll talk about that.
61.28s: Now, the context for their question specifically is completely different.
65.92s: I actually think, and as I mentioned in the discord with them, I could write them an entire
69.88s: blueprint of what I did and it doesn't matter.
71.92s: They have to go through their own process, which I think they're aware of now.
75.28s: But I still think that there's benefit to sharing ideas, how we look at things so that
80.00s: you can fully integrate because this is all going back to this part here where it says,
83.48s: I'm not very good at identifying opportunities.
85.72s: You can't look at just the good ones and say, how did you find that good one?
89.36s: Because there's thousands of bad ones I come across and I lose trades all the time.
93.32s: So there's a bit of an art and science that goes into this game of trading and there's
99.40s: a lot of different things that have to come together.
101.80s: And like I said, even in this trade, I made a few mistakes and I want to talk about those
106.84s: aspects of the position.
108.32s: So to start working through this question though, let's dive into it.
113.44s: The first thing is how did we find the opportunity?
117.68s: That's pretty simple.
119.36s: And it's simple and complex at the same time.
121.80s: I'm going to actually move myself out of the way.
124.12s: So it's easier for you to see and let's talk about it.
126.88s: There are a lot of things that draw my interest in markets.
132.48s: And it's very rarely one single thing that leads me to a yey or nay.
138.52s: It's more often than not what I consider a confluence of evidence.
142.68s: A total picture of what I see going on and then my probabilistic assessment of this
149.28s: scenario.
150.80s: So when I'm playing something like this, there's no part of me that's like, oh yeah, this
156.24s: is made money.
157.52s: This is good.
158.52s: I'm great.
159.52s: I don't necessarily think that.
160.96s: But here's how I found it.
162.60s: I had saw Tesla had broken up out of this little range bound action here on this day,
171.80s: the 26th.
173.28s: So that immediately drew my eye and part of that was catching that it had slightly elevated
180.24s: than average volume, mostly buying volume.
183.72s: That's what I saw.
185.04s: So that gets added to a watch list.
187.28s: It just means I'm going to keep an eye on it.
189.36s: See how it does.
190.36s: I'm curious now.
191.60s: The next day I see a trend a little bit sideways.
193.88s: Nothing too noteworthy.
195.20s: It looks like it wants to start breaking out.
197.08s: Okay.
198.08s: We still just watch it.
199.08s: Volume pulls back a little bit.
200.48s: Then the next day.
201.48s: See volume come up pretty heavy, but a lot of sale volume.
205.32s: It's hanging around these levels.
206.72s: It just broke above the 200 day MA.
209.96s: Now I'm even more interested.
212.24s: I see the moving averages starting to take these really aggressive slopes that happens
219.00s: when things are making big moves.
221.56s: And you need things to have strong, powerful volume to make these kinds of moves.
228.44s: So then next on the first yesterday, I looked down and I see that it's breaking above
235.92s: these levels.
236.92s: Now I know that there's a trade here.
239.28s: It's what I would call a very speculative trade.
242.40s: I don't know where it's going to go, but in my weighing of probabilistic outcomes, I see
247.36s: something that's gaining a lot of very short term heavy, heavy support.
254.20s: It's starting to show a lot of volume.
257.04s: And early in the day, it had much higher than average volume.
261.64s: So then I end up entering a position on the first and then I exit the position today.
268.28s: Typically I would leave a little bit of a runner on and I'll talk about the thought
272.08s: process behind it.
273.08s: I actually think that's one of the mistakes I might have made here, but it's also Tesla.
277.92s: And I know it's very gappy.
279.80s: So I had already made essentially more than I was expecting to.
282.92s: So it was time to then move on.
285.28s: We'll talk about all of that.
286.84s: In a nutshell, that's how I found this trade.
289.44s: There was nothing ultra anomalous about the options chains.
294.72s: When I looked at it, it was moderately interesting.
299.36s: So we'll take a look real quick and see what we see.
303.20s: Today, there was really heavy call volume that I generally expected at this point because
309.40s: now it's on fire.
311.40s: It's gaining a lot of support.
313.28s: But why looked at this yesterday, right?
315.60s: So the details that I saw were slightly different.
318.48s: The other thing that's worth calling out here is the open interest.
323.40s: Definitely was slightly call heavy, not massively.
326.72s: But what I did see is in these kind of shorter term explorations, there was a fairly persistent
334.32s: edge on the primary explorations, kind of like this five July, the 19 July.
339.16s: But again, it's not that different, right?
341.84s: 392 calls versus 3D4 put.
343.60s: So there's nothing super informative from here that keyed me off.
349.00s: Now this was very, very much a different style trade for me.
354.72s: And the entire basis of it was from a technical breakout perspective.
360.12s: So I didn't emphasize options flow in this case.
362.96s: I always look at things like that.
364.80s: But that's not the dominant feature.
367.16s: This is something that's starting to break out out of a range, even though it's downtrending.
371.92s: It has massive, massive volume support as earnings coming up.
376.12s: So I don't want to hold for that long trade on.
378.32s: That's really what it comes down to trading a breakout.
381.56s: So when I look at the portfolio fit for this position, I knew it was going to be a ratio
387.32s: called diagonal.
388.64s: And that's one of the mistakes I actually think I probably should have just done some calls,
393.48s: long calls to start.
395.40s: But I didn't expect necessarily the velocity that we saw.
399.84s: So I thought I would be able to make a little bit of money on the short calls that ended
403.52s: up honestly just being headwind for me.
405.56s: I would have made a little bit more money had I not done those.
408.00s: And we'll take a look at the opening position next right here.
412.72s: So this is kind of the series of positions that I went in.
417.20s: I started with the 20 September 200 calls.
419.52s: The reason why this is two different lines is because it wasn't a tiny trade, it wasn't
423.92s: a big trade.
424.92s: I think this was a 25 lot.
426.56s: So what I need to do is test the market.
428.76s: I need to see where I'm going to get fills at and make sure that the liquidity is there.
434.12s: So I open a smaller tester position, then I scale into the position and then I offer
440.44s: the short calls against it.
442.28s: The short calls were in the 19 July to 15.
445.04s: And I'll give you all the numbers on these in a second.
447.08s: These are just the establishing positions.
449.28s: So this was a speculative trade.
451.00s: The way that I expected to make money in this trade, the profit mechanism is bullish
455.80s: breakout.
456.80s: It needed to move in my direction.
458.08s: That's what I wanted to see.
459.44s: The initial target was literally just outside of the plus two standard deviation channel.
466.64s: These are now standard deviation channels on the chart.
468.64s: These aren't linear regression channels right now.
470.44s: I'm testing something different.
472.12s: So that's a slight difference than what you guys typically would see.
475.84s: But that was the initial target here.
478.04s: It's actually just a big move.
479.32s: I didn't care so much where it hit.
482.32s: I did expect us to start getting gummed up once we start getting close to the 240.
487.08s: Because I can see that's where the next even semblance of a volume node serves on this
491.96s: trade.
492.96s: We got to zoom in just a little bit to like a three month.
495.20s: And you can see it's not even like an impressive volume node at all.
498.28s: It's just the next thing that's here.
500.56s: There's not a lot of overhead resistance.
502.44s: The other thing is I do have a bit of a longer term.
507.36s: Channel.
508.36s: And I expected this to also slow us down just a bit.
512.16s: And it didn't.
513.16s: We kind of pop right above it.
514.24s: So the initial target was above the on a six month was above the plus two CM deviation
522.56s: channel.
523.56s: And I expected to hit this if we did get a strong breakout.
526.76s: I actually didn't expect to fly up and through it necessarily like this.
530.68s: But that was the original idea.
533.16s: And then the downside target you can see that that stop is essentially still there.
537.68s: I had two of them.
538.68s: I had the low of the day on for the first.
541.84s: And then I had just the end of the gap here, kind of at the top of these two candles.
545.96s: So especially after that really big powerful move on the first, it turns into a much lower
553.56s: risk trade because I scoot up that stop just a little bit.
557.24s: So even if I had gotten stopped out here, it would be a very small loss relative.
562.08s: These are ones that I'm expecting with a pretty high probability of getting stopped out.
566.28s: If I get my move, I get my move.
567.84s: If I don't, I don't.
568.84s: It's okay.
569.84s: But I'm looking for an asymmetric return profile here.
573.60s: So I'm accepting a higher probability of a loss, but I'm expecting to make more money
578.40s: if I get my move.
580.40s: So the original management plan was to flatten.
585.92s: I didn't expect to place scaling in or out.
588.44s: And again, that is because this is Tesla.
590.32s: It's very gappy.
591.32s: It moves all over the place.
592.56s: You can have something that shows this kind of profit here, but then it can literally
596.84s: drop off a cliff on not a whole lot of news and you can eviscerate a lot of your money.
602.36s: This is a delicate dance because you don't want to take profits too fast.
605.60s: My typical preference is to leave a runner.
608.84s: And my guess is that's what I should have done here.
611.40s: But I had made more money than I expected on the jump.
614.28s: So just let it go and keep an eye on it.
617.08s: See how it behaves so I can kind of update the model.
620.60s: The loss is easy.
621.60s: That's just to stop out.
623.08s: In that case, exit the short calls for profit, then exit the long calls at a loss.
628.80s: Typically do a few of the long calls.
630.40s: First, test liquidity.
632.32s: Get those out the door.
633.52s: Take the shorts off.
634.52s: Take the rest of the longs off.
635.80s: Move on.
636.80s: That's all.
638.92s: Now, let's take a look at the trades.
642.68s: This was the resulting trades for today.
646.28s: So we can see that I ended up closing these 200s.
651.28s: Those came down for a decent profit.
654.76s: And this is what it all flowed like.
656.52s: So on the first, I had the 25 of the 20-sep 200s.
661.92s: These were in the money.
663.36s: I got them for 26, 645 average.
666.12s: So it's about a $66,000 trade.
668.68s: Then I sold the 215s for 823.
672.08s: That gave me about 5 grand in a credit upfront that literally just ended up being a problem.
677.20s: So today, as soon as I saw the market gap up and start with strength, I took these
682.56s: down as fast as I could.
683.72s: I wanted them out of the way because I wanted to let these run a little bit more if possible.
688.80s: And that's essentially what I did.
690.56s: So I took the short calls down for 183.
693.16s: That's a $6,000 loss, just a giant slap in the face.
696.44s: This is one of the problems of running this strategy.
698.56s: Now you'll notice I had 25 to 6.
701.24s: So the reason for that is I was still very much weighing this upside potential of the
707.04s: ratio called diagonal, but this still served as headwind.
710.24s: But you can't assess trades like that.
712.76s: You have to assess the performance of the process in the system over the long run.
717.80s: You can't overemphasize any one single trade.
720.28s: And I bring that up because while I do think that this was a little bit of a mistake in
724.12s: this trade, I could have entered and then waited to add the short calls.
728.32s: One of the reasons why I didn't do that is for the same exact reason why I got out today
731.72s: because it's Tesla.
733.48s: This thing can drop pretty quick.
736.04s: So if you don't add the short calls and you do get that early drought potentially before
741.56s: you have a chance to see your profit run, it helps dampen that blow just a little bit.
746.80s: And it extends the duration.
748.08s: You can stay in the trade because of where the loss would be realized as a percentage
752.40s: of the portfolio.
754.24s: So that's what happened there.
755.24s: Pure headwind.
756.24s: Then on the 200s, those came down for 40.
760.16s: That wasn't difficult actually getting out of them.
762.04s: I was a little bit surprised.
763.04s: I just unwind the whole position at once.
765.84s: And that netted me positive 33 grand.
769.60s: So then the realized, PN all in the trade was about 27 grand.
773.76s: And it was a 41% return on invested capital.
777.84s: So the trade in Tesla printed really, really well.
780.84s: We essentially took a 26 debit, took it to a 40 credit.
786.88s: And this was all about a breakout trend following trade.
791.12s: That's all.
792.12s: So looking forward at this now.
794.64s: This would be out of play for me.
796.72s: Even if this starts moving up even more, I took my part of the move.
800.32s: It is what it is.
801.32s: I would get out and move on because this starts to look really overextended here.
806.56s: So it can run up more.
808.56s: But I'm not going to put my money there.
810.44s: I'm going to try to find better opportunities because then to place a stop on this is even
815.24s: even higher probability of getting stopped out super quick because when things get generally
819.76s: extended like this, that's a normal trade.
822.72s: This will normalize to a degree.
824.72s: So that's the test of trade.
826.60s: If you have any questions, let me know, be an outlier.
828.60s: See you guys later.
