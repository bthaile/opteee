 Made a little over 30 grand in Tesla over the last couple days, but I also made a couple mistakes. So I want to talk about how I played this position so far and more importantly talk about the benefits and drawbacks about some of my trading strategies. I'm way more interested in identifying the issues with what I'm doing as compared to patting myself on the back and saying, oh yeah, you made some money. There's a long term game. So the goal is to walk you through the ratio called diagonal that I set up in the trade, how I found it, all those kinds of details because we had a question from the discord. Our good friend, GOC said, when exactly and why did you put the ratio called diagonal on in Tesla? This is from our discord. And I post about some of my stuff that I do once in a while in there and that's what they're asking about. And then the following questions is, what indicators, chart patterns, make you take a shot, those kinds of things. And we'll talk about that. Now, the context for their question specifically is completely different. I actually think, and as I mentioned in the discord with them, I could write them an entire blueprint of what I did and it doesn't matter. They have to go through their own process, which I think they're aware of now. But I still think that there's benefit to sharing ideas, how we look at things so that you can fully integrate because this is all going back to this part here where it says, I'm not very good at identifying opportunities. You can't look at just the good ones and say, how did you find that good one? Because there's thousands of bad ones I come across and I lose trades all the time. So there's a bit of an art and science that goes into this game of trading and there's a lot of different things that have to come together. And like I said, even in this trade, I made a few mistakes and I want to talk about those aspects of the position. So to start working through this question though, let's dive into it. The first thing is how did we find the opportunity? That's pretty simple. And it's simple and complex at the same time. I'm going to actually move myself out of the way. So it's easier for you to see and let's talk about it. There are a lot of things that draw my interest in markets. And it's very rarely one single thing that leads me to a yey or nay. It's more often than not what I consider a confluence of evidence. A total picture of what I see going on and then my probabilistic assessment of this scenario. So when I'm playing something like this, there's no part of me that's like, oh yeah, this is made money. This is good. I'm great. I don't necessarily think that. But here's how I found it. I had saw Tesla had broken up out of this little range bound action here on this day, the 26th. So that immediately drew my eye and part of that was catching that it had slightly elevated than average volume, mostly buying volume. That's what I saw. So that gets added to a watch list. It just means I'm going to keep an eye on it. See how it does. I'm curious now. The next day I see a trend a little bit sideways. Nothing too noteworthy. It looks like it wants to start breaking out. Okay. We still just watch it. Volume pulls back a little bit. Then the next day. See volume come up pretty heavy, but a lot of sale volume. It's hanging around these levels. It just broke above the 200 day MA. Now I'm even more interested. I see the moving averages starting to take these really aggressive slopes that happens when things are making big moves. And you need things to have strong, powerful volume to make these kinds of moves. So then next on the first yesterday, I looked down and I see that it's breaking above these levels. Now I know that there's a trade here. It's what I would call a very speculative trade. I don't know where it's going to go, but in my weighing of probabilistic outcomes, I see something that's gaining a lot of very short term heavy, heavy support. It's starting to show a lot of volume. And early in the day, it had much higher than average volume. So then I end up entering a position on the first and then I exit the position today. Typically I would leave a little bit of a runner on and I'll talk about the thought process behind it. I actually think that's one of the mistakes I might have made here, but it's also Tesla. And I know it's very gappy. So I had already made essentially more than I was expecting to. So it was time to then move on. We'll talk about all of that. In a nutshell, that's how I found this trade. There was nothing ultra anomalous about the options chains. When I looked at it, it was moderately interesting. So we'll take a look real quick and see what we see. Today, there was really heavy call volume that I generally expected at this point because now it's on fire. It's gaining a lot of support. But why looked at this yesterday, right? So the details that I saw were slightly different. The other thing that's worth calling out here is the open interest. Definitely was slightly call heavy, not massively. But what I did see is in these kind of shorter term explorations, there was a fairly persistent edge on the primary explorations, kind of like this five July, the 19 July. But again, it's not that different, right? 392 calls versus 3D4 put. So there's nothing super informative from here that keyed me off. Now this was very, very much a different style trade for me. And the entire basis of it was from a technical breakout perspective. So I didn't emphasize options flow in this case. I always look at things like that. But that's not the dominant feature. This is something that's starting to break out out of a range, even though it's downtrending. It has massive, massive volume support as earnings coming up. So I don't want to hold for that long trade on. That's really what it comes down to trading a breakout. So when I look at the portfolio fit for this position, I knew it was going to be a ratio called diagonal. And that's one of the mistakes I actually think I probably should have just done some calls, long calls to start. But I didn't expect necessarily the velocity that we saw. So I thought I would be able to make a little bit of money on the short calls that ended up honestly just being headwind for me. I would have made a little bit more money had I not done those. And we'll take a look at the opening position next right here. So this is kind of the series of positions that I went in. I started with the 20 September 200 calls. The reason why this is two different lines is because it wasn't a tiny trade, it wasn't a big trade. I think this was a 25 lot. So what I need to do is test the market. I need to see where I'm going to get fills at and make sure that the liquidity is there. So I open a smaller tester position, then I scale into the position and then I offer the short calls against it. The short calls were in the 19 July to 15. And I'll give you all the numbers on these in a second. These are just the establishing positions. So this was a speculative trade. The way that I expected to make money in this trade, the profit mechanism is bullish breakout. It needed to move in my direction. That's what I wanted to see. The initial target was literally just outside of the plus two standard deviation channel. These are now standard deviation channels on the chart. These aren't linear regression channels right now. I'm testing something different. So that's a slight difference than what you guys typically would see. But that was the initial target here. It's actually just a big move. I didn't care so much where it hit. I did expect us to start getting gummed up once we start getting close to the 240. Because I can see that's where the next even semblance of a volume node serves on this trade. We got to zoom in just a little bit to like a three month. And you can see it's not even like an impressive volume node at all. It's just the next thing that's here. There's not a lot of overhead resistance. The other thing is I do have a bit of a longer term. Channel. And I expected this to also slow us down just a bit. And it didn't. We kind of pop right above it. So the initial target was above the on a six month was above the plus two CM deviation channel. And I expected to hit this if we did get a strong breakout. I actually didn't expect to fly up and through it necessarily like this. But that was the original idea. And then the downside target you can see that that stop is essentially still there. I had two of them. I had the low of the day on for the first. And then I had just the end of the gap here, kind of at the top of these two candles. So especially after that really big powerful move on the first, it turns into a much lower risk trade because I scoot up that stop just a little bit. So even if I had gotten stopped out here, it would be a very small loss relative. These are ones that I'm expecting with a pretty high probability of getting stopped out. If I get my move, I get my move. If I don't, I don't. It's okay. But I'm looking for an asymmetric return profile here. So I'm accepting a higher probability of a loss, but I'm expecting to make more money if I get my move. So the original management plan was to flatten. I didn't expect to place scaling in or out. And again, that is because this is Tesla. It's very gappy. It moves all over the place. You can have something that shows this kind of profit here, but then it can literally drop off a cliff on not a whole lot of news and you can eviscerate a lot of your money. This is a delicate dance because you don't want to take profits too fast. My typical preference is to leave a runner. And my guess is that's what I should have done here. But I had made more money than I expected on the jump. So just let it go and keep an eye on it. See how it behaves so I can kind of update the model. The loss is easy. That's just to stop out. In that case, exit the short calls for profit, then exit the long calls at a loss. Typically do a few of the long calls. First, test liquidity. Get those out the door. Take the shorts off. Take the rest of the longs off. Move on. That's all. Now, let's take a look at the trades. This was the resulting trades for today. So we can see that I ended up closing these 200s. Those came down for a decent profit. And this is what it all flowed like. So on the first, I had the 25 of the 20-sep 200s. These were in the money. I got them for 26, 645 average. So it's about a $66,000 trade. Then I sold the 215s for 823. That gave me about 5 grand in a credit upfront that literally just ended up being a problem. So today, as soon as I saw the market gap up and start with strength, I took these down as fast as I could. I wanted them out of the way because I wanted to let these run a little bit more if possible. And that's essentially what I did. So I took the short calls down for 183. That's a $6,000 loss, just a giant slap in the face. This is one of the problems of running this strategy. Now you'll notice I had 25 to 6. So the reason for that is I was still very much weighing this upside potential of the ratio called diagonal, but this still served as headwind. But you can't assess trades like that. You have to assess the performance of the process in the system over the long run. You can't overemphasize any one single trade. And I bring that up because while I do think that this was a little bit of a mistake in this trade, I could have entered and then waited to add the short calls. One of the reasons why I didn't do that is for the same exact reason why I got out today because it's Tesla. This thing can drop pretty quick. So if you don't add the short calls and you do get that early drought potentially before you have a chance to see your profit run, it helps dampen that blow just a little bit. And it extends the duration. You can stay in the trade because of where the loss would be realized as a percentage of the portfolio. So that's what happened there. Pure headwind. Then on the 200s, those came down for 40. That wasn't difficult actually getting out of them. I was a little bit surprised. I just unwind the whole position at once. And that netted me positive 33 grand. So then the realized, PN all in the trade was about 27 grand. And it was a 41% return on invested capital. So the trade in Tesla printed really, really well. We essentially took a 26 debit, took it to a 40 credit. And this was all about a breakout trend following trade. That's all. So looking forward at this now. This would be out of play for me. Even if this starts moving up even more, I took my part of the move. It is what it is. I would get out and move on because this starts to look really overextended here. So it can run up more. But I'm not going to put my money there. I'm going to try to find better opportunities because then to place a stop on this is even even higher probability of getting stopped out super quick because when things get generally extended like this, that's a normal trade. This will normalize to a degree. So that's the test of trade. If you have any questions, let me know, be an outlier. See you guys later.
