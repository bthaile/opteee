0.72s: hey everyone eric here wanted to do a
2.80s: quick
3.20s: update on the small stacks portfolio
6.00s: made a trade earlier this week i
7.92s: started building out my excel tracker
10.16s: for it which i'll share
11.20s: going forward but for now i just jotted
14.16s: it on
15.36s: on the page here so let's take a look so
18.48s: still out right now with the two october
22.24s: 24 puts
23.52s: i traded those for 50 cents
26.64s: they're essentially trading at value
28.56s: right now with
31.28s: xlf kind of still drifting sideways i
34.48s: am happy to see price above the 200-day
38.24s: moving average now i do want to see the
40.16s: 50 cross above that but
42.08s: that's just you know longer term thing
43.92s: right now there's nothing to be done in
45.28s: the trade just leave it on
46.96s: we're still um 28 days to expiry
50.40s: next up is zynga so in there i sold the
54.00s: nine october eight and a half put so
58.16s: let's take a look at zynga right now
59.92s: they're trading at eight seven
61.36s: five i'm still down here so i'm
63.76s: comfortable with where i'm at
65.44s: this is a trade that i will roll if i
68.32s: need to
68.96s: but still plenty of time left on the
70.80s: table so again
72.80s: another trade that i don't really need
75.36s: to make an adjustment in it and i do not
77.52s: intend to
79.12s: now the one that i did make a
82.24s: couple trades in is kroger
85.52s: so in here i established a leap diagonal
89.52s: earlier this week and it's because i
93.04s: like the product in general
94.56s: and i thought that it offered some good
97.20s: exposure and
98.40s: a great return on capital so i ended up
101.92s: buying one of the 16 april 21
105.20s: 29 calls at 8.42 cents
108.88s: and i sold one of the 11 september 37
112.00s: calls at a dollar six now
113.52s: i always talk about wanting to sell at a
115.44s: ratio if i can
116.96s: but you know it's a smaller account so
119.28s: in this scenario i wasn't able
121.84s: to sell out a ratio which is completely
124.16s: okay
125.12s: i still structure the trade mining my
128.48s: deltas
129.28s: so that i do not have upside risk that
132.16s: remains to be
133.20s: super important to me so
136.32s: actually today
139.52s: i ended up taking the trade down so i
142.08s: closed out those 37 calls i paid 42
145.20s: cents for it so i realized
147.04s: a profit of 64 bucks and then
150.24s: i laid out the 25 september 36 and a
153.92s: half
155.36s: calls and i collected dollar 16.
158.72s: so that will take me through earnings
160.40s: unless i could take it off before
161.84s: earnings which
162.72s: if i can i will take it again probably a
166.16s: little more
166.88s: you know 55 60 profit and then see what
170.16s: else is out there
171.52s: so for current portfolio
174.80s: stats we're you know i'm still
176.96s: considering it 5000 whereas technically
179.36s: it is
181.64s: 5064 including that recent gain but
184.56s: i'll start to calculate that probably on
186.56s: a monthly
187.68s: aggregate basis the allocation
190.96s: currently is four thousand ninety two
193.20s: dollars so that's
194.32s: about eighty-two percent utilized
196.80s: realized
197.68s: p l is 64 bucks which is a 1.3
200.72s: return on the portfolio that was in
202.88s: three days
203.76s: so obviously um happy with that return
207.28s: and then the credit outstanding is 193
210.64s: bucks
211.60s: that represents 3.9
214.80s: of the portfolio now one adjustment i do
218.16s: intend to make going forward
220.08s: is if i can close out of xlf
223.84s: for a profit instead of taking
225.76s: assignment on it
227.28s: which includes you know rolling i likely
230.08s: will take that down
231.52s: and put on another leap in favor of it
235.36s: and the reason for that is the 50
238.80s: is fine but i don't want to tie up the
242.08s: 2400
243.04s: in the trade i laid it out there because
246.08s: it's a sector etf i'm okay with the risk
248.40s: and if i
249.28s: end up taking ownership of it i'm fine
251.84s: with it
252.72s: but i would prefer to get into a leap
256.00s: instead
256.88s: so that i can kind of enjoy some of the
259.76s: increased volatility we're seeing
262.08s: and pretty much increase the efficiency
265.60s: of the
266.16s: of the account because the
269.36s: kroger leap diagonal right now is
271.76s: absolutely outperforming everything it's
273.76s: you know over
274.56s: a 12 return on invested capital whereas
278.40s: you know xlf and zynga both are a bit
281.04s: lower than that
282.80s: but i will definitely make sure i
285.76s: maintain
286.56s: at least one coverage strangle in the
289.44s: account
290.40s: and once i can take zynga down i will
294.24s: still look for some sort of sector etf
296.56s: etf in general
298.08s: i am convicted in that simply because i
301.52s: want
302.00s: the reduction in
305.28s: unsystemic risk so then once that's set
308.80s: up
309.36s: i will probably maintain that one core
311.68s: holding in some sort of index etf or
314.00s: sector etf
315.04s: and then i am looking to have on
316.64s: probably two leaps
318.40s: at the same time making sure i leave
320.48s: room to scale in
321.44s: so for kroger i allocated 1500
324.80s: to that trade and right now we're using
328.04s: 842 of those dollars which i'm
330.64s: completely okay with
332.08s: that is a very reasonable um return
335.36s: so fine with that however the
338.56s: that's really the beauty of leaps is to
341.20s: be able to
342.40s: efficiently get a decent return on your
344.56s: capital
345.52s: and once i can scale into these
347.44s: positions i will make sure i continue to
349.92s: sell at a ratio
351.52s: so that i also do not cap my upside so i
354.80s: wanted to walk through another diagonal
356.72s: that i'm
357.20s: eyeing for the small stacks portfolio
362.24s: and that is pfizer pfe so
366.40s: what i'm eyeing in here is something out
369.76s: in 16 july 21
373.04s: probably the 28 calls those are
376.96s: trading at around nine dollars and it's
379.20s: a 83 delta and then i would
381.04s: sell uh to october 36 and a half
384.32s: call against it so the reason why i like
386.56s: this trade one i like pfizer a lot where
388.64s: it is
389.36s: i also think that it's a very solid
392.64s: return on invested capital it's a 900
395.12s: trade to open up and i would collect 128
398.48s: on the short call so it's a 14 return on
401.68s: invested capital
402.80s: over the course of 28 days if i hold to
405.12s: expiration
406.32s: now part of that is because there is
408.64s: earnings coming up the 27th of next
410.64s: month which is totally fine not worried
412.56s: about that
413.84s: and the thing with pfizer that
417.28s: i enjoy obviously is they're working on
419.84s: their covid cure
421.28s: so i like the involvement there i would
424.64s: like to see it come down just a little
426.40s: bit more which may adjust the trade a
428.24s: bit
429.04s: but i am going to target an
432.16s: entry between um 35 and 36
437.36s: somewhere in there so i'm kind of
438.48s: holding off waiting for that now
440.64s: if i do see a good trade in there i will
443.68s: take it
444.88s: even before i have the
448.32s: trades in xlf
452.16s: off and the reason why i'm doing that is
455.12s: because
456.16s: i have room in the portfolio yes i will
458.24s: be near max allocated and it will reduce
461.12s: my position in kroger
462.88s: my max position in kroger but that's
465.68s: again
466.24s: one of the trifles with smaller
469.28s: portfolios is working through those
471.36s: decisions so this is where we're at
474.32s: currently
475.12s: obviously i'll take a look at the pfizer
477.04s: trade see if that materializes for me
479.68s: as always if anybody's any questions or
481.92s: any comments that they want to work
483.36s: through feel free to let me know
485.04s: and i will catch you all later
