0.44s: we are going to dive into option
2.56s: liquidity what it is what to look for
5.88s: how to assess it I'm going to give you a
7.64s: checklist I'm going to give you some
8.84s: real examples along the way so that you
11.24s: understand what it actually looks like
12.80s: in a practical scenario what things
15.76s: impact it and how so at the end of the
18.28s: video you should have a really good
20.64s: understanding of how to assess and find
24.04s: liquid options what's up everyone Eric
25.88s: here welcome back to all the outliers
27.28s: shout out to the patreon family Let's
29.40s: Get Right In so what is option liquidity
32.12s: it's essentially the ability to transact
34.80s: at a fair price when you want the vast
38.32s: majority of instances where retail
40.00s: Traders are putting in orders we are
41.56s: consuming liquidity because we are
43.76s: placing an order it gets filled you've
45.72s: just taken an order off the market that
48.40s: somebody else could have used and
49.88s: somebody gave you the ability to
51.68s: transact there that's liquidity now if
54.96s: you submit an order and it's resting
58.00s: well then actually you're giving
59.48s: somebody else the ability to trade
61.52s: you're providing liquidity with that
63.52s: position so just some Nuance now I want
67.84s: to talk about some of the massive
69.48s: mistakes people make with respect to
71.96s: liquidity and this is the biggest one
74.92s: there are two key components of an
78.20s: options trade the entry and the exit
82.72s: Traders are really good at analyzing
85.40s: liquidity when we're trying to get in
87.20s: once we know we should what most Traders
89.40s: are not good at is conceptualizing
92.12s: liquidity when we're looking to exit the
95.12s: trade what this could look like when
96.92s: we're ready to get out because these
100.08s: different forces can impact liquidity
102.08s: and at the end of the video you'll be
103.76s: able to have a much better idea what
105.40s: liquidity might look like when you're
107.16s: getting out because what's really
109.68s: frustrating is if you put on a trade you
112.04s: struggle to get in then you have this
114.36s: big fat profit that you're sitting on
116.72s: and then when you try to get out you
118.36s: can't exit at a fair price so then you
120.40s: start giving up your profits because you
123.04s: have to adjust your price in order to
124.92s: try an exit we want to avoid that so
128.80s: there's a few metrics that we care about
130.64s: this isn't really a holistic list
132.48s: there's a few more things that you'll
133.64s: hear throughout the video but these are
135.32s: kind of the primary ones we can start
136.76s: with the number of expiration Cycles is
138.88s: a really simple test of liquidity
141.40s: because they only offer more expiration
144.28s: Cycles when there's demand for them
147.28s: meaning there's enough volume and people
150.00s: transacting to derive liquidity that's
152.08s: why if we take a look at something like
154.08s: QQQ you can see that it has a bunch of
156.52s: these extra expiration Cycles standard
160.00s: expiration cycle is just the third
162.84s: Friday of the month so right here is a
165.20s: standard expiration cycle you'll notice
167.48s: that there's a ton of additional ones
169.24s: around this if you take a look at cnx
172.64s: you'll notice that this is a product
174.00s: that only has standard expiration cycles
176.52s: and this is very common we are now just
178.68s: seeing options becoming more popular in
181.20s: things like spy being able to offer
183.48s: essentially daily expiration Cycles
185.36s: which is very cool but that's the first
188.32s: thing you can look for to see if
189.96s: something's liquid or not does it have
191.96s: weekly expiration cycles and if so it's
194.64s: probably slightly more liquid and for me
196.72s: that's a primary filter I use just cuz
198.40s: it's easier you can look it's about 550
201.76s: products that will have weekly
204.24s: expiration cycles and they're typically
206.08s: more liquid than those that don't we
208.40s: care a lot about the bit ask spread
210.52s: which we're going to talk a lot about in
212.40s: this video now quick cliff notes of that
215.92s: if you look at any option right so let's
218.16s: look at this at the money call the bid
221.24s: ask spread tells you essentially where
224.72s: you have to transact that if you want to
226.48s: get a fill this instant so what that
229.08s: means is the bid is the most somebody is
232.68s: willing to pay for something right now
235.28s: the offer is the cheapest somebody's
238.32s: willing to sell something at this is the
240.40s: bit ask spread this is what market
242.36s: makers and other Market providers are
244.20s: typically trying to capture and it's
246.64s: kind of the same thing if you go to an
247.88s: airport and there's a currency exchange
249.84s: they typically will buy lower than what
251.92s: they'll sell at and they capture that
253.84s: difference that's what's happening here
256.12s: so if you want to get a fill this
257.44s: instant they're showing you where you
259.08s: have to go in order to get there now
261.80s: smart Traders will try to play what we
263.44s: call the mid price the difference
265.72s: between these and you can typically get
267.44s: a fill in there but it's not guaranteed
269.12s: and sometimes you have to move it around
270.64s: a few pennies to find your fill but if
273.72s: you want to get a fill right now you
275.88s: have to go to the bid or the offer or
278.16s: you can submit something like a market
279.48s: order but that's typically a worse fill
282.68s: meaning you don't get a great price you
284.20s: don't get a good bargain which we want
286.04s: to avoid you can then also look at
288.96s: things like the volume for the options
292.04s: chain for the individual strike you're
294.40s: looking at those matter quite a lot we
298.20s: also care about the total interest what
301.16s: Delta your option is the days to
303.24s: expiration we'll get into how all of
305.64s: these impact your options liquidity but
308.48s: they all do so let's talk about these
312.32s: when we think about the impact of an
315.24s: underlying price on liquidity one of the
317.88s: effects that you'll notice is that if we
319.80s: look at more expensive underlyings they
322.44s: will naturally have wider bit ask
324.40s: spreads so if I grab something like
327.84s: MST which is a $1500 product give or
331.12s: take you'll notice that the liquidity
333.04s: here it's much wider so if I'm looking
335.36s: at an at the money 49 DTE out of the
338.20s: money but it's at the money call the bid
342.12s: on this is
344.68s: 19630 and the offer is
347.12s: 212 so it's a pretty big bidas spread
351.44s: it's like 16 points but it's a $1,500
355.04s: product if we take a look at something
356.84s: like spy which is still pretty expensive
358.60s: it's $532
360.24s: but you'll see that these for the at the
362.92s: monies they're
365.04s: $168 by $739 so much smaller of a bit
369.32s: ask spread than what you just saw in
370.56s: mstr but it's also much cheaper and then
373.32s: you can look at something even cheaper
375.00s: still like maybe qld which is
378.20s: $86 and you'll see that this kind of
380.88s: varies a little bit but this is $6 by
383.96s: 690 this is actually a less liquid
386.24s: product because do you notice how many
388.12s: expiration Cycles there are there's just
390.00s: not that many and then if we take a look
392.08s: at the overall open interest across a
394.88s: different series of expiration Cycles
396.68s: there's 9,000 options but then if we
399.56s: take a look comparatively to spy look at
402.00s: all these different expiration cycles
404.36s: and then take a look at the open
405.32s: interest there's 8.8 million options so
409.68s: there's a few things you should have
411.16s: picked up from what I've just shared the
414.40s: first thing is that the price of the
416.20s: underlying impacts the liquidity of your
418.76s: option more expensive opt more expensive
421.40s: underlyings will typically have wider
422.96s: bitas spreads less liquid options on a
425.80s: relative
427.04s: basis as volatility expands that will
431.16s: impact your options liquidity which
433.28s: we'll take a look at the type of strike
436.64s: also impacts your options liquidity so
439.68s: what does that mean well if we take a
441.84s: look at something like
444.40s: gmy and we take a look at these 14 DTE
447.96s: options let's take a look at at the open
450.28s: interest for some of these options let's
453.32s: take a look at these 212 notice that's
456.80s: 21.5 the liquidity on those options or
459.32s: the current oi is
462.12s: 204 options but if I look at the
466.12s: 21s they're
468.28s: 1,033 or if I look at the 22s they're
471.60s: 2590 so what I'm showing you is a
473.92s: standard strike price is going to have
477.12s: more liquidity more often than not than
479.76s: half strike prices or other kinds of
481.64s: strike prices the other thing you'll
483.52s: notice is that round numbers things like
486.24s: 20 25 30 will tend to have more open
490.72s: interest and Tighter options let's take
492.20s: a look these 20s there's 9,000 options
496.80s: then if we take a look at the 21s
498.20s: there's a th000 if we take a look at the
499.80s: 22s there's 2500 and then let's see what
502.36s: happens when we get to 25 there's
505.48s: 17,800 options this is just human
508.00s: psychology at Play we like round numbers
510.76s: and that's all this is so now you know
514.28s: the price of the underlying impacts it
515.84s: and how you know that the strike type
518.48s: impacts it inh how meaning if it's a
520.80s: weird strike or if it's a standard
523.08s: strike or if it's a round number or not
526.00s: we also know things like further out of
529.32s: the money or in the money can impact our
532.44s: options so let's take a look at what
533.64s: that looks like if we take a look at
536.08s: these deep in the money options you'll
538.44s: see that they're bid 1670 by
542.12s: 1740 but then if you take a look at
544.08s: these at the money options they're bid
546.48s: 92 cents offered
548.52s: $1 much tighter than the in the monies
551.68s: and then typically as you get further
553.24s: out of the money the same thing will
554.56s: happen why is this because the market is
557.32s: more liquid when more people are
559.44s: transacting at those levels in the
561.60s: majority of instances people transact at
564.20s: two points options that are nearer in
567.96s: expiration so typically with within 30
570.04s: days you'll see more options activity
572.48s: and options that are closer to at the
574.48s: money tend to be more active
577.32s: so as you go further out in time you'll
581.56s: notice that options become less active
583.52s: and I'll show you again using GameStop
585.36s: right now the average open interest is
587.12s: 556 th000 so if we take a look let me
591.04s: just do it as all really quick so it'll
592.92s: be a little easier to see let's take a
594.92s: look at two different expiration Cycles
597.44s: this is a standard expiration cycle
599.88s: which is the third Friday of the month
602.32s: this will typically be more liquid than
605.04s: other weekly expiration Cycles so as I
607.96s: said before I like to look if they offer
609.92s: weeklys but I still try to stay in the
611.88s: standard expirations because they're
613.40s: going to be more liquid so if we take a
615.56s: look at this 16 Aug you'll see that we
618.40s: have 228,000 calls against 107,000 puts
622.80s: right so about 330,000 is if we go
626.04s: further out in time to this 18 October
628.40s: which is a standard exper operation but
629.72s: there's 90,000 and 62,000 way less
632.56s: options and this is standard this is not
634.76s: unique to GameStop this is very very
636.40s: common for pretty much any other product
638.00s: that you'll find so we now know that as
642.32s: you go further out of the money or in
644.28s: the money and if you're using longer
646.24s: dated expirations you're going to see
647.68s: less liquidity so then how does
649.76s: volatility impact it very simply as
653.92s: volatility expands bid ask spreads widen
658.16s: and I'll have as specific example for
660.84s: you to take a look at but if you take a
662.88s: look at something like
664.32s: QQQ as volatility has been expanding
667.64s: that's what these yellow lines represent
670.16s: the options have become wider bid ask
674.12s: spread and that serves as a natural
676.84s: breaking function for crazy runaway
679.72s: markets now again I'll show you an
681.76s: example of that in a minute so let's
684.04s: talk about how can you
686.08s: conceptualize liquidity how do you know
688.60s: if something is liquid or
690.80s: not you can create a benchmark so what I
695.52s: would do is take a look at the
697.20s: underlying that you want to trade we
698.80s: need to know what the DTE with the Delta
701.80s: what the type of option whether it's a
703.08s: call or a put and then we take the bid
705.72s: ask spread as a percentage of the strike
707.92s: price this creates a bid ask ratio I'll
710.80s: show you what it looks like and then
712.80s: find the same option in spy and compare
715.84s: it so in this example if I want to
718.76s: compare McDonald's and I want to use the
721.32s: 49 DTE expiration first strike out of
723.76s: the money this is a 47 Delta something
725.68s: like that I'll take that down and then
727.56s: I'll look at it and then I'll come over
729.16s: to spy I'll find that same 49 DTE I'll
732.44s: find something that's right out of the
733.64s: money in this case it's a 54 Delta so
736.24s: you could also compare the actually same
739.52s: Delta which in this case is a 47 Delta
742.68s: so if I grab that same 47 Delta 49 DTE
748.52s: option so that I'm comparing the same
750.24s: thing across the board I grabbed QQQ spy
753.44s: mstr and MCD for your reference and for
755.84s: those that are in the outlier Pro
757.88s: patreon I'll have a download for this
760.28s: just as a template super simple to make
762.68s: all you do is take the same strike to
764.60s: make sure you're compare in the same
765.80s: thing take the bid ask make sure it's
767.64s: the same type of option you figure out
769.56s: the bid ask spread and then you take a
771.56s: ratio of the bid ask by the strike price
774.64s: and this will help you understand what's
776.32s: Liquid so in this case we can see cu's
778.00s: are actually even more liquid than spy
780.92s: and we can see that MCD is pretty liquid
783.20s: and we can see on a relative basis mstr
786.08s: is not super liquid now you'll get a
788.96s: feel for what actually is liquid and
791.80s: isn't but in this case something that's
794.32s: less than a percent of bid ask spread
797.08s: I'm not super concerned about it that's
799.28s: about okay however go back to this point
802.76s: this is to enter the position so we know
805.44s: right now that the market is a little
806.76s: bit more volatile things are selling off
809.44s: so if I think it's going to be less
812.52s: volatile in the future then this should
814.36s: be about as bad as it's going to get in
816.52s: terms of liquidity now if I think it
819.28s: might be even more volatile when I'm
821.36s: exiting I have to expect this to guide
823.80s: up and if it guides up too far then I
825.76s: have a problem so here is a quick
828.80s: checklist you can use I typically am
830.84s: going to stick to things that are above
832.56s: $5 is an underline just for General best
835.20s: practice I like weekly expirations you
837.92s: can make this comparison just like I
839.56s: showed you and there's one other
841.88s: component based on how often I'm
845.20s: planning on transacting matters so for
847.04s: example if I'm trading something like a
848.36s: covered call where I'm not really
850.00s: expecting to do anything once I sell the
851.76s: option it'll either be out of the money
853.56s: and expire or be in the money and I'll
855.68s: be assigned I don't actually care quite
858.32s: that much because I'm not transacting
860.48s: that much but if I'm trading something
862.24s: like a ratio diagonal which has more
864.76s: options legs that I'm moving around a
866.76s: lot or if I'm trading zero DTE need a
869.40s: lot of liquidity because I'm transacting
871.44s: a lot so what this means is the more you
875.24s: transact the more liquid you need the
877.80s: underline to be now there's one other
880.16s: example I want to show you and this is
881.88s: looking at GameStop and I'm looking at
885.40s: two different time frames for a
888.20s: comparison take a look at the periods
890.72s: I'm going to show you here which is the
893.28s: 2nd of May and here which is the 7th
896.52s: what do you think the difference in
897.92s: liquidity in just this is after this
900.68s: move notice how I'm not using an extreme
903.36s: I'm not using any of these days I'm
905.72s: comparing the liquidity between this day
907.76s: and this day what do you think you're
909.04s: going to see throw it in the comments
910.56s: and then I'll show you I looked at two
912.68s: different time frames the 15 and 50 DTE
915.92s: on 2 May and I looked at the same
918.16s: expirations so then they became 10 DTE
920.32s: and 45 DTE which as you know these are
923.04s: getting closer to expiration so these
924.92s: should actually be more liquid so let's
927.88s: see what this looked like I'm comparing
930.64s: the call and the put side the bid ass
933.36s: the bid ass spread and then I'm looking
935.12s: at a Delta here I try to normalize
937.44s: closest so most of these are not
939.12s: perfectly 75 or 50 Delta but they're
941.72s: definitely less than
943.40s: 0.05 off so it's the closest I can find
946.76s: to these and you'll see that again in
950.00s: kind of that 2ay period that for the at
953.36s: the monies we typically see better bid
956.24s: ask spreads meaning they're tighter
957.92s: that's standard fair and we also see
960.76s: that the closer DTE has tighter bitas
964.56s: spread which is also standard fair you
966.20s: know all of that now now let's see what
969.04s: happened on the 7th of May if we take a
972.24s: look at the options take a look at how
975.52s: massively the bid ask spread changed in
978.48s: this scenario the reason why I'm
981.08s: highlighting this scenario and that
982.56s: should be a
984.44s: 1.11 got that doctored right up for us
987.32s: and you'll notice across the board that
990.52s: the bidas spreads widened and you can
992.72s: see some of them widened by a lot if we
994.96s: look at this 0.5 Delta we went from a
998.36s: 0.07 spread to
1001.08s: 0.29 a massive change so what I'm
1004.56s: highlighting to you is in this example
1007.52s: this isn't even that big of a move and
1009.08s: it's up typically when things are going
1012.00s: up volatility declines and spreads would
1014.92s: be a little bit more favorable to us but
