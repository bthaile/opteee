294.00s:  through comprehensively analyzing what has happened so that then come next year, you can hit the
303.20s:  ground running. You can actually start off doing things in a slightly more optimized manner based
309.84s:  on what you're seeing. This is something that I do. And I've been doing this for a long time now.
315.44s:  The reason why I do that is because markets continue to evolve. The second that you think as a
321.92s:  trader that like you got it all dialed in, you already know what's going to happen. It's all,
327.04s:  you know, known goods, not like it literally is not. I actually just made a really long post on
334.96s:  Reddit compiling some of my other posts so that it's a little bit of a reference. That's the point.
342.48s:  And as I was writing a part of it, I was reminded of a really, really important piece.
351.36s:  The piece that I was reminded of is the fact that even though I've been trading for 17 years now,
361.68s:  I've only experienced three bear markets in of those three bear markets. Two of them have been
370.24s:  in the last four years. So it's kind of an interesting statistic, whatever you want to call it.
376.48s:  It's an interesting thing to me because with that context, it lets you know that this world that
384.08s:  we're in of trading can be very path dependent, whatever something happens to show you at a
391.44s:  given point in time. And for me, obviously a big part of what it showed me was a really prolonged
399.28s:  bull market. And people might mistakenly immediately think that that's like all good and
404.16s:  great. And wow, that must have been a great starting point. And it kind of isn't the reason why
409.12s:  everything has its series of problems. And that's another thing that I highlighted in the
416.00s:  post that I made is for somebody like me, I absolutely have grown up with very much of a resource
424.48s:  constrained mindset. And that impacts me in a lot of different ways. Now taking that back
432.96s:  to the idea of path dependency and whatnot, we all are going to face a series of challenges based
439.60s:  on our individual circumstances. They all look a little bit different. So there's going to be some
444.32s:  traders that maybe came from a less scarce environment that are more and maybe too risk open.
452.72s:  If we take a look at trading, maybe we have traders that just started trading during 2020 when
457.36s:  the Stimmi checks came out and they have their perception of what things look like.
462.32s:  The important thing to understand is that there is an element of path dependence around the time
468.40s:  that you happen to begin trading, doing whatever you're doing. You have to be aware of that. So
475.68s:  going through a review process is non-negotiable. Because even if you do this for a long time,
482.08s:  there's a really solid chance that things are going to continue and move and evolve. And unless you
486.56s:  can successfully make that journey with it, you fall behind. And you start making mistakes,
492.08s:  you start drawing down, you start losing money, you don't want to lose. So that is,
498.24s:  that's actually I think a pretty solid intro for today. So this is interesting with the tariffs.
504.40s:  I actually hadn't been looking at this. What did you guys learn about tariffs here? Oh,
508.16s:  look at that. That's hilarious. I love that he has that.
516.16s:  When Trump is running for president in 2016, said he might consider to, okay,
521.76s:  then we can pause that. Now, the session for today is a little bit of a reboot from the session
530.40s:  yesterday, which is actually kind of a good thing, I think, because we might be able to move through
535.04s:  in a more condensed manner. Because when I'm doing these live streams, I never, I literally never
540.80s:  know what direction we're going to go or we're going to talk about. So it's not obviously a fully
545.76s:  polished refined thing. It's something that we're talking about live. That's the concept of a
552.96s:  live stream for those that are curious about that. So we did a video yesterday and we actually
559.04s:  spent a little bit of time talking about priorities for a trader. And that's what I want to talk
565.20s:  about today. And you might be saying Eric, if you just said we talked about that yesterday,
571.20s:  why are we going to talk about it today? And that's actually a fantastic question.
575.28s:  It's a great question to ask because it seems redundant, which I have to agree with you. It does
581.84s:  feel slightly redundant. Alas, the video that we did yesterday is gone, dead and gone.
592.64s:  The reason why it's dead and gone is because we had literally a, I'm not even kidding, a 28
601.44s:  second clip of a TED talk about quantum computing, 28 second clip. And in that 28 second clip,
611.36s:  they decided to strike the video. So the video is dead.
618.16s:  The funny part about that, by the way, is a lot of times when you have a copyright infringement,
623.92s:  what they'll do is they'll let the video stay up and then they just take the ad revenue,
629.84s:  which is always a little annoying anyways because it's like, well, if you do a video that's,
634.88s:  I think that video was like two hours long. And it's two hours of unique personal stuff about
640.56s:  whatever we're talking about. But if there's this 30 second component, then they then get all of the
644.88s:  ad revenue for it, which is a little confounding to me the way that that works. But they didn't even do
651.36s:  that. They literally just removed it. So that's why every time we start the videos and people are like,
659.68s:  yo, there's no sound. Yo, there's no sound. I know, dog. I know there's no sound, which is
665.52s:  hilarious. Trace says, hey, hey, this may be the second time they've done this, they shut it down
671.28s:  midstream, which was rude. That is true because the mid I, and that was for, I distinctly remember
677.20s:  that one too. That's when we were watching something about the Apple goggles.
683.44s:  I like, and I remember we were watching it from a direct source too, which is crazy.
690.80s:  Yeah, I, the thing with fair use is very strange because I do think that that video technically
696.24s:  would be fine under fair use. I actually appealed it, but they have 30 days on the appeal because it
701.76s:  goes to whoever the creator was. So I, because I think what ends up happening is they will,
709.04s:  they see the clip somehow, the YouTube algorithm super smart will detect the overlap,
713.44s:  and it's normally by the volume. That's why this other way works for now. And my guess is they
720.64s:  just get a bunch of them, and they probably just copyright all of them by default without looking
725.60s:  at it. So you have to like go through an appeal process. Now, I think for bigger creators,
729.92s:  what they can do to avoid that is like, preemptively reach out and try to talk to them about it or
734.00s:  something, but I'm still on the peasant world. So like, I know for a fact, if I reached out to
738.88s:  TED Talks, they would literally say, go fuck yourself, and I don't blame them. I am a peasant.
744.08s:  I am nowhere near the same level as they are. So I thought we would begin with a recap of this
752.00s:  priorities for a trader discussion that we had yesterday. So let me grab our little drawing pad.
758.40s:  And I am actually hopeful that we can talk about this in a slightly different way since we did
765.20s:  just talk about it yesterday. I'm going to go through the general artifacts that I think belong
768.96s:  here. But I think people probably have had a little bit of time now to digest specifically if
776.24s:  you were on the live stream, if you weren't on the live stream, then yeah, you'll just have no
779.28s:  idea what we're talking about, which is good. This will be a first of its kind for you.
783.84s:  So we had a conversation about the priorities of a trader. And if we look at the world of a
794.56s:  trader, it starts first with goals. The reason, if you're called, why it starts with goals is because
806.40s:  literally everything else we do is going to be reverse engineered from this.
814.16s:  So this needs to be specific. We need a very, very specific thing that we're trying to do.
823.20s:  It needs to be measurable without something that's measurable. We are shooting at a highly
831.52s:  nebulous target. It's kind of a waste of time. It does need to be achievable. It needs to be
839.68s:  realistic within the bounds of where you're at. And I normally skip the R of a smart goal. I think
848.64s:  it's like relevant or I think it's I think the R is relevant. But I don't really do smacks. I just
854.96s:  think it's an extra word so that they can make the word smart. I think that that's whatever the R is
860.24s:  based on what I looked at it before. I think it's covered in this, which is time bound.
868.96s:  So when we think of our goals a lot of times we start with really superficial ideas. We start with
879.44s:  I want to be rich. I want to make a lot of money. One of the things I work with a lot of people
884.32s:  in the mentoring program, which is really interesting to me because it shows the detachment. That's
890.40s:  actually one of my favorite things that I have the opportunity to do with the Patreon side of
895.44s:  things is I get a chance to like really get much closer to retail traders to understand different
901.20s:  perspectives and how we think about things. And it literally helps me inform everything else that I
906.08s:  do because I am full will aware that the way I do things is very different than the way a lot of
912.64s:  other people will do things. I am again, I'm aware of that. So a lot of the things that I would say
919.52s:  or do or prefer doesn't inherently apply to anybody else. So it lets me tailor things more specifically.
925.76s:  So taking it back to the point I was making when we look at the goals I'll normally say something
933.60s:  like what's your goal? And the goal almost looks the same slight variations. The goal will be
942.16s:  I want to replace my income. I want to retire in 15 years. I want to have, it's actually rarely
950.96s:  a certain amount of money. Most people don't say a certain amount of money. It's normally one of
954.00s:  those first two definitely. And then what would I say the third most common might be?
963.20s:  I don't think it would be like make money. I don't think it would be reduced risk.
966.24s:  I honestly think the overwhelming majority of responses fall into one of those first two buckets.
974.16s:  So that matters because if you think about those goals they're fine. And here's an important
982.24s:  note that you have to take on board early with your priorities. You do not need
989.76s:  a perfect goal to start. As we talk about these priorities and as we talk about literally everything
1006.16s:  you do as a trader what I want you to always keep in mind is an 80% solution now.
1014.24s:  Is better than 100% solution later. Now there will be certain things that this doesn't apply to.
1028.80s:  If we're talking about stuff that's like very, very, very high on what we would call a racey matrix
1036.88s:  in the Marine Corps. And I think other services use different versions of that too. It's just a
1041.04s:  way to evaluate risk. But if we have something that's very high severity meaning if you fuck this
1046.24s:  up the severity is massive then that deserves better than this 80% now. Especially if you have
1056.24s:  the luxury of time. But the premise behind 80% solution now is greater than 100% later is really
1062.48s:  to get people out of their own way. And I'll give you an exact example. My original goal as a
1068.32s:  trader was to be a millionaire before 30. That was my original goal. And guess what?
1074.64s:  Moving in the correct direction is plenty fine. If that as a goal got me moving in the correct
1082.24s:  direction. It wasn't a perfect goal. I was actually one I needed to revise a couple times. But that's
1087.04s:  what started me off. So what I'm trying to highlight is you don't need a perfect goal to start.
1091.12s:  Pick something that generally starts moving you in the correct direction and then refine it as you
1095.84s:  go. Now if you're further along and you're because that that's I'm talking about 17 year old
1100.80s:  I don't even know how old I was. I'm never good with ages. I was always curious about this.
1105.04s:  My dad before he died. I used to ask him when I was a kid like how old you are. And he would
1109.76s:  literally say I don't know. And that was the most strange thing to me. But I cannot identify more
1115.28s:  with that man now because it like I literally don't know sometimes. So anyways I don't know how
1120.24s:  fucking old I was. But I do remember that this was back in like 2008-19. It wasn't my first year
1127.20s:  of trading. But it was after I'd been trading a couple years I was like trying to think of what I
1130.72s:  could do with this. So just pick fucking something. And at that point in time it was fine. Now if
1137.20s:  you're further along, if you have family, if you have a wife or a husband, kids, you you don't
1144.80s:  get to be lazy anymore. You're grown human being. You are absolutely able to go through a
1152.80s:  planning process. So what that means is when we're setting goals, they need to be more specific.
1161.20s:  So for somebody that says I want to replace my income for an example.
1167.92s:  Do you think that this is a good goal or not? In your in your genuine opinion and then I'm
1173.12s:  going back into my videos really quick to grab the video about setting goals. This video.
1183.04s:  But do you think that that's a good, do you think that's a good goal? Replace my income.
1195.84s:  I would argue that it's fine. It's a fine goal to start with.
1203.84s:  But it lacks a tremendous amount of specificity. Because here's the problem with this as a
1214.64s:  in a original objective. Lizzy says it depends on your personal picture. I agree with that.
1221.76s:  And to broaden Lizzy's point, there's more nuance to this. Because if we want to replace our
1228.24s:  income, that stands for year zero. That stands for the year that we're going to try to replace our
1233.60s:  income. So if you have $100,000, as our salary or whatever, that means that we would probably need to
1241.12s:  earn through trading like 125 or something like that, depending on how the rest of this shit looks.
1248.16s:  So this could be fine to start. The problem is that if you're 35,
1259.04s:  is this the same amount of money that you want to live off of for the next 50 years?
1266.80s:  Maybe it could be. And this could be completely fine. You might even say I need less than this.
1271.20s:  That's great. The point though is that it should be considered. And most people don't consider it.
1276.88s:  This is because most people are trying to solve the problem that's right in front of them.
1283.12s:  And they're not thinking more deeply about what they're doing. So what that means is if I'm
1288.48s:  standing here, this is a normal size person that has regular arms and my foot is on fire.
1298.88s:  I don't really know how it caught on fire, but my foot is on fire. My immediate concern is this
1306.64s:  making my foot not on fire anymore. That's what this is the equivalent of.
1313.20s:  Your foot's on fire. You're thinking about only your foot being on fire. Now,
1319.92s:  as an example, this is kind of a fun example that's just like this is actually kind of fun.
1326.56s:  Like thinking of random stuff in my brain. The equivalent of this example is if your foot is on
1334.08s:  fire in your solution for your foot being on fire is to jump into this vat of whatever
1345.76s:  to put the fire out. So this is your solution. You're going to jump in this vat.
1351.84s:  The problem is when you jump in the vat, it's fucking acid. And then your face melts off like this.
1362.96s:  So even though there's a big problem upfront that we have to solve for, we are too focused on
1372.80s:  this immediate problem. And we become over focused on this empty problem on this upfront problem
1380.24s:  that we're not considering the solutions around us. So this just looks like
1387.44s:  better choice. I'm going to jump in here to be put out. But it's fucking acid. And now I'm melting
1396.00s:  my skin is bubbling and falling off. That's worse than this. It's actually worse than this.
1401.44s:  This is a little bit extreme, obviously. It's kind of a, I don't know why my brain is like this,
1405.36s:  but it is. This is just the example I thought of. And
1408.72s:  but that is the equivalent of this because you can become so myopic on trying to replace your
1417.20s:  income here that you fail to think about this 50 year timeframe. And then you can do everything
1425.20s:  in your power to build a system that allows you to hit this. You could build a system that checks
1433.28s:  this box for you. But it comes at the price of building something that's more robust, scalable,
1440.08s:  and actually serves you better in the long run. So maybe rather than jumping into the vat of acid,
1447.12s:  you run outside where there's a hose and you put your foot out.
1459.28s:  Here's the downside to that. By the time you get out there, you're going to have some burns.
1463.04s:  You're going to have some third degree burns. You're going to absolutely have
1466.88s:  an affliction by the time you get there. But I would argue third degree burns on your leg
1473.68s:  is still preferable to jumping into acid. This is bad. This is a bad life choice almost always.
1482.56s:  And Joey brings up a great point because if there's an open vat of acid, you might want to check
1487.84s:  what's coming out of the hose before you start squirting your leg with it.
1494.00s:  Maybe you have a friend nearby and you know, just give them a little squirt, something like that.
1498.72s:  Make sure that you're good. This is a really great point, Joey, by the way. But the main thing is
1506.64s:  a little bit of near term pain and acceptance might be a better solution ultimately. That's
1512.64s:  the same thing here. We don't want to get so stuck on solving this upfront problem that we then
1520.08s:  forego thinking about potential future problems that we just hadn't considered yet because they're
1525.60s:  still there. And this is what most people do. And again, I've had quite a few people in the
1533.60s:  mentoring program. And this is a very common thing because this is still a much better starting
1541.04s:  point than what a lot of people will come up with. And it's not their fault. They've just not thought
1547.12s:  through this before. And we can solve for this. The way we solve for this is through something.
1556.40s:  And it could be whatever you want, but something like the money mindset exercise.
1560.32s:  I, again, this document I built it for myself to literally help me solve this fucking problem
1572.48s:  because I didn't know what the answer was. But putting yourself through a thought exercise to
1578.88s:  help gain some clarity around this can literally help you solve this problem. That's the point.
1585.20s:  So this is goals. This is this is the this is your first priority as a trader before anything.
1592.16s:  Literally, like Metallica says, nothing else matters at this point. Nothing else matters because
1598.80s:  without a goal. It is just a fucking crap shoe. That's all it is without a goal. This is a
1608.00s:  straight crap shoe. Okay, cool. So now that we have our goal set, your next priority as a trader,
1620.56s:  let's say we know that we wanted to hit this target. And let's say that this is well defined. Let's
1628.32s:  say that you think that this is a good starting point. This will solve your first five year needs
1633.92s:  that you intend to expand over time. That's perfect. That's exactly what you need here. So that's
1639.44s:  what's going on. Beautiful. The next step is we need a brainstorm. How do you get here?
1652.32s:  And yesterday we talked about a lot of really great ideas to get there. We talked about things
1657.04s:  like selling a listed substances, substances. We talked about things like selling the flesh of your
1662.72s:  body. You do have spare body parts like extra kidneys. Those can be offloaded. You don't really need
1668.72s:  it. I don't know if there's really a market for one of those things, tonsils, the things in the
1674.72s:  back year throat. I don't know if there's a market for those, but you got those people get them out
1678.96s:  all the time. Same thing with the dangly thing. No, the epiglottis is the flap. I don't know what the
1684.72s:  dang is. I don't want the dangly thing in the back year throat is called. But whatever that thing is,
1690.24s:  maybe you can offload that to somebody that wants a new dangly thing. They're trying to upgrade
1695.04s:  theirs for some new shit. Those are great ideas to start with. Now, the problem with this is that you
1701.36s:  will slowly run out of body parts that you can sell. There's only so many of them. So then we're
1707.20s:  going to need to move into another phase. And this is actually a really great description of
1714.56s:  the thing that I talk about it. You can't save your way to wealth.
1719.92s:  Reese lets me know it's called a uvula. Great. Thank you. That's for everybody that is
1723.60s:  wondering. Same as I dangly think uvula. So maybe you can sell your uvula.
1728.80s:  But you can't save your way to wealth because you can only cut so much. And in this example,
1733.44s:  you can only cut so much off or out. So now we need to start coming up with some other ideas on how
1739.76s:  we can hit this. And you can think of a bunch of different ways. This step is very basic.
1751.44s:  I am just trying to think of a conceivable approach. So we used examples like day trading.
1761.68s:  Swing trading.
1763.44s:  Market making.
1769.36s:  Value investing.
1773.20s:  So on and so forth. So this process is just to give you a basic, basic understanding of what
1781.28s:  modalities might be there. Then now is when we apply even just a little more rigor. We're not
1788.56s:  getting into the strategy process yet. We're starting at a very high level of exploring the profit
1795.76s:  mechanisms from all of these, all of our ideas and seeing what fits. What can we easily eyeball
1805.28s:  out of the way? Very, very basic, very basic. And for example, you might look at something like day
1815.44s:  trading. And you might say, okay, day trading, it seems like you can make some money doing that.
1824.72s:  But then you realize that you work a full time job and you can't get to your phone during most
1829.28s:  of the day. Okay, well, day trading is viable, but it's not applicable to you. It's just not
1836.00s:  something that fits in your scenario. So we can ask day trading off this list because we know the
1840.96s:  general profit mechanism from day trading is being in front of the screen most of the day trying to
1846.32s:  trade intraday price fluctuations and so on and so forth. So we then create a short list from this.
1857.04s:  This is your first, this is literally your entire first series of steps as a trader. Now if
1862.56s:  you're starting this brain storming phase and you're like, I don't know anything about swing
1867.04s:  trading. I don't know anything about market making. I don't know anything about value investing.
1871.60s:  This means you need to spend a little bit of time learning about these. And if you're a new
1877.92s:  trader in this section here between goals and brainstorm, I would literally read options as a
1886.08s:  strategic investment. I would read volatility pricing, volatility in pricing by Nate and Berg.
1896.64s:  And then I would read positional options trading by you and Sinclair.
1905.36s:  This is for a brand new trader. These three books.
1910.64s:  And I think these three books are highly applicable for a brand new specifically options
1915.04s:  trader because these cover a lot of bases and they also give you a very natural sense of a
1923.12s:  progression for yourself because you're going to need to track questions and build the syllabus.
1940.24s:  Now we talked about this in passing yesterday as part of some of these other steps. I'm adding it
1944.64s:  as a distinct step here because I do think continually creating a focused learning path
1954.16s:  designed to answer questions that are specific in setting specific time,
1963.60s:  frequency and topics for our learning sessions. And again, I would literally pretend
1975.12s:  whatever entity, whatever thing that you might make a, whatever entity or thing that you might
1985.52s:  make an appointment with that in your mind and your world, there's a zero percent chance
1992.32s:  than that you would ever miss the appointment. That's what needs to happen here.
1998.80s:  Very, very specific process.
2004.64s:  Lizzie says this is better than yesterday. Well, that's good to know that you thought the time I
2010.40s:  spent yesterday was straight trash in a waste of everybody's time. So that makes me feel good.
2016.80s:  Lizzie, I appreciate that feedback. And maybe it's good then that that video got copyright struck
2023.20s:  because obviously the the effort that I put into it was worthless. It's just good to know. I'll
2031.84s:  take that to heart. And when I'm sitting at dinner or something later, maybe I won't eat
2039.60s:  because I might think that I won't be worthy of eating at that point. I think that would be fair
2045.52s:  because it feels like in order to eat a meal, you have to be worthy, right? Like you have to put
2051.92s:  some work in. You have to have some sort of output. So Lizzie's essentially told me not to eat
2056.96s:  anymore. So I'll probably take that advice on board. I won't eat anymore. And then I'll punish myself.
2065.04s:  So really, really appreciate the feedback Lizzie on that. And yeah, yeah, just just for everybody's
2073.60s:  awareness. Just don't watch the video yesterday because Lizzie said that it's a giant piece of trash.
2079.68s:  So, um, message is received. Lizzie, thank you. Very clear. By the way, um, so
2089.68s:  now we have our first four steps. Are there any specific questions on these four steps?
2100.24s:  These four steps are your without a doubt, the straight priority. And it's in this order.
2111.36s:  It's literally as simple as it gets. Now again, simple doesn't mean easy. They're different. But
2122.00s:  that's all there is to it. These are your first steps without a doubt. And what I try to remind people
2128.64s:  is for anybody that is going through this process, trying to figure out their priorities.
2136.40s:  And this is what I offer for the folks that are in the mentoring program. But you can also just
2140.56s:  jump in the discord. Again, there's an entire free section of discord that will always be open
2144.08s:  for everybody. Now, fun fact, it's going to be flooded with bots always. That's the nature of
2149.12s:  having a free community space. They're going to find their way in. But just don't don't go to your
2153.68s:  DMs. That's all you have to do. Pretend that that's like the dark web. And you avoid that place
2158.16s:  unless you're savvy with navigating your way through it. But you can always reach out to us and say,
2165.52s:  like, Hey, this is what I think I'm going to work on. This is my ultimate goal for the end of the
2171.12s:  year. Does this make sense? Is this like a good priority for the next week or for the next month?
2176.88s:  And people will give you feedback because the process of that again is beneficial to everybody.
2182.88s:  Because somebody else seeing what you're working on, how you're thinking about it might give them
2186.96s:  some ideas. And the process of trying to give somebody advice also forces them to think through
2192.32s:  the process for themselves. So it literally is a mutually beneficial approach for everybody. So
2197.76s:  if you're like really hung up on what to focus on next, ask somebody. And again, for those that are
2204.00s:  in the mentoring program, I have a doc that we maintain each time we meet where we should be
2210.08s:  inputting. And I always offer that to everybody. You can input exactly what you're going to focus on
2214.72s:  for each week for the next set series of weeks. Tag me in it. And then I come look at it and give
2219.44s:  you direct feedback on whether or not this exact thing makes sense. It doesn't matter what shape
2225.36s:  you can use chat GPT if you want. But the main thing is don't let the questions stump you and stop you
2232.16s:  from going through the process and making progress. Again, it goes back to this thing. You don't
2238.56s:  have to have a perfect roadmap in place, but you need something that's generally going to move you
2243.28s:  in the correct direction. So these are your first four steps. Now, let's fast forward and let's say
2250.72s:  that we're moving through these pretty quick. Let's say that you have your goals. Let's say that
2254.40s:  you've brainstormed different approaches and you found a couple that you think work well. And you
2259.52s:  have built yourself a way that you want to learn about these approaches that preliminary look well
2266.96s:  and stuff like that. Step five becomes the outlier strategy process.
2274.56s:  This is exactly what happens next. So for those that haven't seen this video, I'll grab it for you.
2283.28s:  This video here. And this is literally where you enter into the outlier strategy process.
2301.36s:  And it doesn't you don't have to do the outlier strategy process. You do whatever
2304.72s:  fucking process you like makes sense for you. I offer the way that I do things to give you ideas.
2311.84s:  It is not prescriptive. I hope all of you know that by now. The stuff that I share, the
2316.88s:  the stuff that I discussed with you is purposefully designed to be things to get your thoughts flowing,
2322.08s:  to give you a starting point, because sometimes that's the hardest element to come up with is
2326.48s:  literally just a starting point. So we then run the outlier strategy process.
2335.20s:  Oh shit, I gotta get my pen. Hold on.
2372.80s:  This is what you do. You define the profit mechanism for whatever you found. And you get way more
2381.44s:  specific now in terms of the type, the signals. Again, this is where we get qualitative and quantitative
2390.64s:  information about it. We get very, very specific. Here is where we outline all the different
2396.08s:  structures. It's essentially what you did in the brainstorm step. But now it's more specific to
2401.84s:  general approach that you think you're going to try. So say for example, you came across the momentum.
2411.76s:  Whatever it is that you wanted to try trading. And you've got that listed out. You understand
2418.72s:  the profit mechanism. You understand the type and signals that are applicable. Now we start listing
2423.36s:  all the individual structures that might make sense for this. So that's looking at stuff like
2430.00s:  buying stock, buying calls, so on and so forth. And then after you conduct another eyeball test.
2446.64s:  And again, remember the idea behind an eyeball test is to be able to just weed out things that are
2451.76s:  bad or don't apply with minimal effort. So again, another great example is maybe you're trying
2456.72s:  to trade a momentum. Let's say you have a $10,000 account. And you're trying to trade
2463.68s:  based on the momentum research that you looked at SSRN because you're studious and
2467.60s:  enterprising and you're going to leverage existing research to come up with your ideas as you
2472.32s:  should. That's very smart, nice job. And you say, well, in order to like really, really capture
2481.20s:  momentum, we need to have at least eight to 15 holdings, something like that.
2487.12s:  So then you might look at what you might be able to do in terms of buying stock with your $10,000
2492.00s:  account. But if you have 15 holdings and you have a $10,000 account, you really can't put on
2497.28s:  big positions. So you might say, well, buying stock might work. It might be the simplest, but this
2503.04s:  might not work for me because I need a little bit of leverage for more capital efficiency. So maybe
2508.72s:  we start favoring something like buying calls. That's an eyeball test. You could do that in seconds.
2513.68s:  Doesn't take a lot of effort. So then once we complete the eyeball test, we pick
2520.16s:  the top performers. And this doesn't have to be the top one. This could be like the top one to
2527.60s:  three, whatever you want. And now is where we do the work. Now is where we go through the effort
2538.40s:  of building the strategy. This is where we test all of the different permutations that we think
2547.28s:  might apply. This is where we tinker with buying the calls that are 10 days, 20 days, 50 days,
2553.84s:  100 days, 200 days, 365 days to expiration, so on and so forth. This is where all the work is done
2562.00s:  in the strategy development. And in step six, I'm going to use my mouse here.
2570.56s:  We need our trading plan. Trading log.
2580.24s:  Oh, shit, S is tough. S is tough, bro.
2584.24s:  So especially with my mouse. S strategy outlines. There we go. Got it. Got it out.
2600.16s:  That's literally a comprehensive list of priorities for a new trader. So first things first,
2605.12s:  let me know if you have questions on any of this stuff. A travel Ursula says, I don't know where
2611.20s:  this fits in, but there's also the trader's psychology. Some strategies when he tried, you may work, but
2616.80s:  are not for you because you're personality in mind. It's a great point. And it's also a really
2620.24s:  delicate dance because some of it is finding things that align well with you, which is exactly what
2626.40s:  this process will identify. But the other part of it is getting your brain to adapt to be more
2633.20s:  successful in interfacing with different things. So I have two videos that I need to share with you.
2641.76s:  The first one is about trading plans and trading logs. The next video is actually a response to,
2655.84s:  I think, what travel set up above, which are some of the elements of trading psychology.
2661.28s:  This is a recent video I did. There's actually another one that I have coming out in a couple weeks.
2666.96s:  And then as always, Shrej is doing the Lord's work.
2679.92s:  And giving me an excuse to plug my paper trading video that has a resounding 460 views.
2688.32s:  I love that. So it's literally a classic, absolutely classic scenario.
2697.28s:  It is hilarious. So how do we feel about that? And this was originally from Lauren and Lizzy.
2706.72s:  And I really do want to make sure that you both are comfortable now that we've had a couple
2711.20s:  times to talk about priorities. And I actually think what would be really great for both of you,
2717.52s:  because I think both of you are in the Patreon if I'm not mistaken. So you both should dump it
2724.96s:  in the Discord if you can. Dump it in the Discord now. And we literally can take a look at it
2729.60s:  together on the way that I would think of it. And for those that would like as well, you can drop it
2735.84s:  in literally in the chat here. And we literally can just run through a quick feedback session for
2742.80s:  people. It's super, super fast. It doesn't take long. It's easy to do.
2746.32s:  And here's what we need.
2759.28s:  Well, month objective.
2763.92s:  Six month objective.
2768.80s:  One month objective.
2769.76s:  Week over week priorities.
2780.56s:  And this is for this first month leading into this first month. The week over week priorities
2785.60s:  are going to change. But it's got to happen. I got to open a window.
2790.48s:  I have, it's funny. I have these shirts from like this weird brand that I came across that I
2804.24s:  like their shorts. And they have like these really thin shirts, but somehow they're like nuclear
2810.32s:  warm. They're so warm. I don't understand how or why it doesn't make sense. It's kind of like
2815.84s:  fairy dust or fake news. All right, we got to see what Mel wants for dinner. I'm getting hit up
2822.00s:  for the dinner order. Bulls 101 says written trading plans help me the most with combating my
2831.12s:  biases. Absolutely. And the fun fact is as you're going through the process of building a written
2836.48s:  trading plan, it's naturally going to give you what you need to work on. Right? So let's say that
2842.88s:  I'm running. Let's say I'm running a strategy. Harvey says is it unique close heat tech? No,
2853.68s:  I don't buy anything specifically for heat at all. I'm so warm. Naturally, there's a 0% chance I
2859.76s:  would buy specifically something designed to keep you warm. I actually think this is literally
2863.44s:  I think it's like it's sheer. I don't know if you guys could see through. I could see through it
2866.56s:  pretty easily. Like very, very sheer, but it's still somehow very warm. But let's
2884.00s:  fuck I forgot I literally got completely sidetracked. The fuck was I just saying?
2889.60s:  I was talking about some sort of example priorities trading plan. Perfect.
2900.00s:  So let's say you're building a strategy outline. And again, that trading plan video goes through all
2906.00s:  of this, but you're going to write your executive summary. You're going to have your section for
2911.92s:  your setup. You're going to have a section for entry slash management. You're going to have
2922.96s:  a section for AR. And as you're building this, you're not truly going to come up with questions.
2932.88s:  You're going to come up with things that you need to figure out. So for our momentum,
2937.84s:  we might need something like understanding momentum. We might need to figure out what does it look
2951.28s:  like. We might need to understand what stocks exhibit it. We might need to know how it behaves.
2969.28s:  We might need to know what signals predict it. This process, as you're literally as you're filling
2983.28s:  in your executive summary, and as you're starting to fill in the actual strategy outline within your
2988.96s:  trading plan, it's going to identify all of these fucking questions that you rightfully will have.
2995.60s:  So now what's my what's week one priority? Well week one priority is to understand
3003.68s:  momentum. So what does this mean? Maybe I'm going to watch some videos.
3016.88s:  Maybe I'll hop on SSRN like a good enterprising trader should and look at existing research.
3023.52s:  Maybe I should grab a book. Start reading it. Maybe I can ask chat GPT to summarize.
3035.84s:  I don't know what's going on with my little pen. It's starting to get real squarely on me here.
3042.08s:  But what I'm showing you is that you literally can create your own series of highly,
3049.68s:  highly tailored specific applicable focus topics based on this exact process. Lauren says,
3060.72s:  I do hair. I do hair in its the holidays. I haven't had a lunch break in two weeks. That's
3065.12s:  well, that makes me a little sad. Lauren, because I'm still supposed to be getting my fucking hair
3071.60s:  did by you. It's about time I need to get my hair done up for just to treat yourself.
3080.80s:  And you still have not offered to do my hair, which is a little frustrating because I feel like
3088.56s:  if somebody needs their hair, did it's me and yet you forsake me for some
3094.32s:  range of reason, I don't understand. Lauren says research with focus. I learned that yesterday.
3101.68s:  And that's actually a really important point because the problem set that you face now
3109.92s:  is actually very interesting compared to the problem set that I faced when I was learning.
3115.12s:  When I was learning, it was information scarcity. You literally couldn't find a lot of it because
3121.28s:  there just wasn't that much work out there on trading, specifically options trading or anything
3127.36s:  like that. Whereas now today, it's kind of the inverse. There's so much information that you could
3135.44s:  easily get completely caught up in just looking at random shit that may or may not matter. And that's
3141.92s:  why going through this process is so important because this process is literally what gives you the
3149.12s:  shit that is important for you to focus on. Gotta get done. So and this is why as a trader,
3159.68s:  you have to be a thinking adaptable being because the problem sets that you face are going to
3167.36s:  continue to evolve. And if you can't autonomously adapt to solve for different problems,
3174.08s:  you're going to have big fucking problems because trading is going to continue to move and evolve
3180.08s:  at a rate that literally forces you to keep up and figure it out or straight up get left behind.
3188.16s:  And if you're trying to do this for a living, we do not want to get left behind.
3195.12s:  So that is my approach to managing priorities as a trader. It's that whole section summarizes to
3203.68s:  create goals, create a learning plan based on you filling out your trading plan strategy outlines,
3212.00s:  and then be very specific about what you're trying to learn and when be intentional is the idea.
3219.76s:  Lizzie says my goals are in the discord. Perfect. Let me go grab those so that we can look at them
3224.08s:  together. I'm going to clear this whole thing off. We'll take a look through this and then we will
3229.12s:  pivot after this. Also, fun fact on Twitch, I still have zero followers and I have nobody watching.
3242.16s:  It's perfect. I kind of get a kick out of that. I like envision myself just talking to nobody
3249.52s:  on Twitch. I don't know why I think that that's entertaining, but I do.
3252.96s:  All right.
3258.96s:  All right, Lizzie, where's your stuff? Show it to me.
3273.68s:  Okay, here we go.
3275.28s:  All right.
3281.28s:  And just to show how much of a problem Lizzie's take a look at this. Liz in here goes by
3295.28s:  Lizzie. But then here she goes by Liz. This is what I'm talking about. I don't know what it is
3305.92s:  with the lizzas of the outlier community, but y'all just like fucking playing with me.
3311.20s:  That's what I've learned is you guys just literally try to make this as difficult as humanly possible.
3318.96s:  Trade up.
3321.12s:  James says is Twitch really known for a live streaming financial related stuff, thought it was
3325.28s:  like video games and stuff. It's definitely primarily video games and stuff for sure, but there is
3328.88s:  a small finance presence on there. The main reason why I'm even trying the dual stream thing is
3334.48s:  because especially for the people that would be on Twitch, I am hopeful that some of them will
3341.20s:  randomly stumble across this stuff because most of those people are going to be at the age
3345.84s:  that this stuff is really fucking impactful. That's my thought, but I could be completely wrong,
3354.40s:  but that is my guess. All right, let's see what Mel wants for dinner.
3369.92s:  All right.
3370.48s:  All right.
3373.36s:  Joseph, how is pizza last night? I was fucking trash, bro. It was not good.
3379.52s:  Crash is a little dramatic, but it definitely was not good. Like, would not order from there again.
3388.96s:  Okay.
3391.76s:  Let's see what Liz's priorities are.
3393.44s:  New setup, large monitor, rearrange scheduling, start 15 a day, what goes in there? Okay.
3401.92s:  So here is the important thing. This stuff doesn't matter. The setup doesn't matter. This is
3410.08s:  stuff that's already done, which is good. Rear range scheduling, I imagine, has to do with
3416.16s:  creating time, which is good. So I think here it's defined 15 minute segments,
3433.44s:  which is this, this here. But the first thing is to figure out where they go. Where,
3440.00s:  where are the 15 minutes that we can always get to? That's what this is.
3445.92s:  Week two, this is not it, because this is, this is kind of like saying, breathe.
3453.68s:  All right. Like we were saying that we're going to start the 15 minute per day here.
3458.08s:  We don't need to say that we're going to keep doing it because you need to do it. It's there
3463.52s:  already. We already have this. So for week two, this is where we need to define
3473.84s:  our priority for the week. So this is more so what belongs here. This can belong here.
3487.36s:  That kind of thing. But this is fine. Like this is completely fine. This is completely fine.
3497.28s:  But this is not because this is just a given. So now we have clear one month objective, which is great.
3508.32s:  And we have a clear six month objective. So for the six month objective, have trading plans and
3513.60s:  logs that means somewhere in these week over week priorities, we need to make room for trading plans
3524.96s:  and trading log development, whatever that means. Spend five minutes updating the trading plan.
3530.80s:  Spend five minutes going through trading log. Like all of those are completely viable, getting lit up.
3544.00s:  Let's see what this one is. Getting lit up by mail. Let me know. It's time to order dinner. So
3549.44s:  you'll have to excuse me for a moment. Let me know if that makes sense, though.
3560.88s:  Why we include the 12 month, six month and one month objectives.
3574.32s:  Travel says what about a step to evaluate if plan is working? That is inherent to this. So
3587.92s:  one of the things that I talk about doing, it's a great call out. One of the things that I talk about
3593.68s:  doing is a weekly, monthly, annual, AAR process. So the AAR process after action review is exactly
3613.76s:  what it sounds like. It's where we look through what we did and how we did. So for example, the
3619.84s:  out the AAR process for the one month is going to be all about this. Have I researched
3629.04s:  whatever I'm supposed to research? And again, this should be more specific with what I'm trying
3632.88s:  to research. But the question is, have I researched what I'm supposed to be researching? Do I have a
3640.08s:  trading schedule that works for me? That's what the AAR will be for the first month. On a weekly
3648.48s:  basis, this is where we're tracking our progress towards that one month objective, which then feeds
3654.08s:  into your six month objective, which then feeds into your 12 month objective. So to tie all that
3659.60s:  together for you, if our 12 month objective is to make 10% profit in a year, that means that we need
3668.56s:  to have trading plans and strategies that have the potential to yield 10% profit per year. Do we have
3677.36s:  that? The one month objective might be research one approach that can move me towards 10% per year,
3688.24s:  whatever that is. The goals purposely should nest within one another so that our shorter term goals
3696.80s:  feed into the longer term objectives. That's the process here. All right. Let's see.
3708.00s:  Let's see what we order in tonight. Do you guys have Mel likes crispy burger? Do you guys like,
3718.00s:  I don't know anything about that. What is that? I was just like a burger place.
3724.96s:  Oh, that looks fine. I don't really care.
3738.32s:  It looks like some sort of local chain or something.
3747.04s:  It looks fine.
3751.12s:  Joe says, never heard of crispy burger. I don't know where they're, I don't know where they're
3755.20s:  around. But this is cool.
3768.00s:  I can dig it.
3782.48s:  Cool. All right. We're all ordered up.
3789.44s:  Okay.
3798.56s:  Are we generally good, comfortable with priorities, priority development, all that kind of stuff?
3809.52s:  I think this should just about give everybody a pretty clear initial roadmap and focus,
3817.76s:  at least on what to do for next steps.
3822.56s:  Joe says, you sound like a robot echo. I know what that means.
3825.84s:  Does something sound weird?
3831.04s:  Robot tide. Oh, it might have been as the desk was raising.
3837.76s:  Cool. Well, clear this off.
3840.00s:  Now, the other thing I wanted to do really for however long we want is we can run through
3852.40s:  whatever you want. We can have kind of an open conversation here for a little bit.
3856.64s:  If there's anything that you guys want to talk about or take a look at,
3860.32s:  this says, can you set the video for transcripts? I don't know what that means.
3864.40s:  Do you mean like to have the video producer transcript if so, they automatically do it?
3872.32s:  I don't know how long it takes them, but they'll automatically build captions for them.
3882.24s:  Travel says I have a question on strangles. Yeah, of course, let's do it.
3886.80s:  The rest of the sessions and I just kind of an open conversation, an open dialogue
3891.12s:  about whatever we want. Maybe we can go over the post that I made in Reddit. I think there might be some
3900.64s:  some good stuff in there. Lizzie says yes, it didn't happen last night. Yeah,
3906.56s:  because they took the fucking thing down. They nuke the stream.
3913.60s:  But it normally doesn't, I don't think it happens that fast anyways, especially for longer videos.
3918.16s:  I don't think it's like an instantaneous thing. I don't know how long it takes, but it takes a
3923.92s:  little while. Bull says, what's your Reddit username? Genuinely, I have no idea. I literally
3931.04s:  don't even know how to see that. I'll see if I can figure it out though.
3934.40s:  But for travel, let me know what the what the strangle question is.
3953.84s:  Happy to take a look.
3954.88s:  Joseph, I think the trick is to not let it play longer than 30 seconds without talking over
3964.96s:  pausing it. Yeah, well, that falls into fair use, but it's not, it's not defined because the video
3970.16s:  from last night, I literally looked at it as 28 seconds. So it's not even, it's not 30 seconds
3976.00s:  unfortunately. But the homework that I've done on fair use is that it's, it's actually not limited
3982.08s:  to any specific time frame. I think they look at it subjectively, but part of it would be the
3986.32s:  total time frame relative to the total length of the video. But my guess is again, for bigger
3991.44s:  channels like that, they probably just see a smaller channel like mine. And I'm imagining that
3996.96s:  they get the alert and they're just like, yeah, fuck that. Like I don't think that they're actually
4000.24s:  looking over it to see like, do I think that this is good or not? That's my guess at least.
4006.08s:  I don't actually know from a practical standpoint. So yeah. Okay, so travel says, so imagine one
4016.00s:  month out, one put one call, the put is at 50% so want to close. So not just call. So then what?
4023.92s:  Let me see if I'm understanding your question. So in this scenario that you're outlining,
4038.88s:  you're saying that we have a short strangle that's 30 days. And I'm assuming you mean sold to open.
4053.92s:  So we sell to open a strangle. The put is at 50% of max profit. So if we have we sold to open one put
4069.20s:  at a dollar. So to open one call at a dollar. So you're saying the put is at 50%. So we're saying that
4087.60s:  in this case, the put is now at 50 cents. The call is now probably will dependent on what volatility
4097.20s:  and stuff did. The call might be worth more. It might actually be worth less. Let's do this scenario
4102.96s:  where the calls worth more. Let's say the calls worth like a dollar 25 or something like that.
4110.80s:  And you want to close. So what you can do is you can buy to close this for 50 cents.
4121.52s:  That means that you're going to realize your PNL of 50 bucks on the short put side. And then
4133.28s:  you're going to have the short call side that still remains.
4143.28s:  So the question of try to get another put for the same expiration. That comes all the way back to
4150.56s:  whatever strategy you're trying to do. This sounds like you're trying to break the strangle apart
4156.00s:  into different pieces, which is okay. It's viable. But you'd have to test like what you're trying
4161.76s:  to do this in and whether or not it makes sense. So that to me is the first step here to figure out
4169.44s:  it's not so much should we just add another put. But the question I have is just like what's the
4177.04s:  plan here? What are we trying to do with this strategy as a whole? Because it sounds like you're
4182.64s:  trying to arbitrarily apply the tasty trade methodology of like 50% max profit or something. In this
4190.56s:  case, I'm speculating I'm guessing. But that's my guess is that you're you saw something from
4196.16s:  tasty trade about 50% max profit. So I think you're just trying to apply that in the circumstance,
4201.12s:  which is an okay starting point. But I think it's a little bit
4206.24s:  nebulous because say for example, the trade has passed a week and your put is showing of
4218.16s:  50% profit on it. It might be exactly where you want it to be now. So there might not be a reason
4224.32s:  to take the trade down as doing exactly what you want. The trade is doing exactly what you want.
4228.96s:  You might want to move the put to rebalance your deltas if that's part of it.
4236.96s:  Travel says so covered strangle should treat as hold not two parts put in call. Okay,
4241.28s:  so that's different. That's another strategy. What we're talking about above here is a short
4246.40s:  strangle. What you're saying here is a covered strangle and a covered strangle has three legs,
4253.12s:  which also includes a share component. So I'm not sure which one you're discussing here.
4261.92s:  But they're they're different strategies. A covered strangle. I understand. That's completely
4270.00s:  different now. Now I understand. So for a covered strangle, that is based on whatever you would
4278.80s:  want to do with the put because for a covered strangle, there would also be shares.
4284.00s:  In this case, we would have at least 100 shares of a stock because there's a short call out.
4291.36s:  I guess a short call starts here. So if we want to do something with the put,
4298.08s:  then for the covered strangle, there's a couple of questions I ask. Is why am I taking the put off
4303.12s:  that 50% max profit? Do I think that risk is going up? Do I make 50% max profit in two days?
4310.64s:  And I want to roll the short put up to make more money to follow the trend. Am I trying to reduce
4317.60s:  overall exposure of the covered strangle position, meaning if I have 500 shares here, I have three
4325.28s:  short puts out. And I want to take some of the total risk down. So maybe I take two of these down
4331.76s:  or all three of them. This, the entire premise of the management of this put is not just taking it
4338.88s:  down because it's in profit, but it's what happens next. And one of the first questions to answer
4345.52s:  this is if I'm trying to take the short put down just because it's in profit, then the next question
4354.72s:  you naturally have to ask yourself is, is there something else that then I can put on after I take
4362.16s:  this off? And if there's not a good answer to that, then don't do that. So what I mean by that is
4371.20s:  you might look at taking this, these short puts down. And then you might say, well, I don't actually
4377.52s:  want to sell more because I don't want to move the delta up. I don't want to move further out in time.
4383.36s:  Then maybe these just stay on instead versus just taking them down at like a 50% max profit.
4389.84s:  So it does go back to the same concept of what is the purpose of the strategy? What are you trying to do?
4396.16s:  But with
4400.00s:  with the covered strangle, I normally would let the option component of it take in way more profit
4408.24s:  than 50%. There's no reason to cap it at 50%. Unless there's again a portfolio driven purpose
4417.12s:  where we're trying to reduce risk, we're trying to gain more exposure or whatever the case is.
4426.56s:  So I would take a poke through some of the short strangle videos that I've done and see
4432.24s:  see if that helps you out. It's a good question, but it's a very nuanced, a very, very nuanced answer.
4443.44s:  Cool. I think that's all we got. That's all I got for tonight. Now, the last note I'll give you guys
4455.44s:  is I am going to be doing a new
4461.36s:  outlier options trading bootcamp come the new year. I'm in the process of building
4466.08s:  the syllabus for it actually that I talked to you guys about. And I would actually love to brainstorm
4472.56s:  that a little bit with you all. So if you don't mind hanging out for a few minutes, this is everybody
4478.64s:  can drop off. That's just trying to see what they can learn from like a trading perspective. This
4482.80s:  next part is a little bit more brainstorming and helping me figure out honestly how to help you guys.
4490.32s:  So my idea for the upcoming options trading bootcamp is we've had a few prior boot camps
4503.60s:  where we've spent time working on like the very, very basics of things,
4509.52s:  right? Like the theoretical elements of options trading and stuff like that, which is kind of my
4513.76s:  idea for this one to start. But I want to figure out for most of you, because most of you are the ones
4525.28s:  that tend to be on the live streams, right? So I'd rather make live streams and I'd rather the segment
4530.00s:  be way more applicable to you all. I'd like to get a sense of how comfortable you feel with like
4536.08s:  the basics of options. And what that means is this, let me grab this. What I mean by that is
4549.92s:  if I put this up, like is there anything in here that's new to you, that's novel? My guess is for
4562.08s:  most people would be no. Like is to like why we might trade options and stuff like that?
4567.84s:  The question is open-ended because I'm just trying to get a sense of what kind of things and
4574.56s:  what kind of concepts you all are ready are very familiar with and comfortable with because then
4580.00s:  the bootcamp itself will be tailored to that. So what that means is I'm still going to go through
4584.80s:  the basics. But instead of doing, for example, a first session that's all about what options are
4594.48s:  and what derivatives are, maybe if most people are comfortable with that, we can do a session that's
4600.40s:  what options are, what derivatives are as an overview, and then we can cover a couple other things,
4606.24s:  like who the market participants are and stuff like that. So that's my,
4614.40s:  that's what I'm thinking about. And what I'm probably going to do is keep those videos specifically
4627.20s:  to an hour, like a very strict hour. And the reason why I'm going to be more strict about that
4634.72s:  is because one of the pieces of feedback that I got in the last one is that there was for people
4641.20s:  that were like watching the recordings, it was a little difficult because during a lot of the videos,
4646.16s:  I was taking questions and stuff in the middle. So I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to
4655.04s:  still take questions and stuff, but I have to be more thoughtful about where I do it. So I'm not
4662.00s:  going to wait until the end. That's too long. I'm not going to do like 45 minutes straight and then
4666.00s:  15 minutes of questions. I think that that's way too long. But beyond that, what I'm going to do
4671.68s:  is figure out how much stuff I can put into a block. And then there might be two blocks or three
4680.00s:  blocks or four blocks during one of the sessions, one of the sessions that are an hour long. And then
4686.24s:  after the block is each block is where we'll do questions about the preceding block.
4692.88s:  Okay, so let me see. Lauren says calls, yes, puts no. Okay, so Lauren's on basics, that's fine.
4699.68s:  Will Stratio says rates. Okay, so you have questions about that. Reese is curious about
4705.36s:  all structural alpha. Okay, so this actually seems like I can probably, yeah, so this, okay,
4713.44s:  this is actually really, really helpful to be honest, because it gives me a sense of where
4717.60s:  everybody's at. So it actually might make sense to do it essentially from the top, so to speak.
4723.04s:  But then I can bucket stuff like this, this you've all seen a million times, this you've all
4733.04s:  seen a million times. So I can bucket stuff like this into a block that would be pretty quick
4739.12s:  to like run through these sorts of things. And then we can spend, so I'll probably target like
4745.60s:  maybe three blocks per session. And then each block would be like 15 minutes. Yeah, that's
4752.16s:  solid. Okay, super, super helpful. Thank you. And Bull says, do you have a way to track
4757.44s:  opportunity costs and prioritize traits? That's probably what I need to improve the most.
4761.60s:  So you have to be a little more specific with respect to opportunity costs. Do you mean like
4771.68s:  other trades? And if so, other other trades, you can literally track that in a excel sheet,
4786.56s:  right? Like in your trading log, that's what I do is I don't just track the trades that I have
4791.36s:  on. I track trades that I might have taken. That's actually what I'm doing a lot of this week. I
4795.44s:  put on a couple trades. I'm not going to lie. I'm supposed to be taking stuff off because I have
4799.60s:  some travel coming up. But your boys are degen and I can't fully step away, especially if I see
4805.04s:  opportunities that I'm like, yo, there's no way I'm not going to at least do this. But I'll just
4809.60s:  size it down a lot. But beyond those, what I do is I build a log that lets me track stuff that I
4822.88s:  might have taken that I didn't necessarily take. And that's exactly how you can track the
4828.24s:  performance for those and see what other trades might have done for you and see if there's any
4832.88s:  trends you can pivot between travel. Uh, travel, uh, travel, Ursula says for me,
4839.04s:  managing with examples of trades going different than expected in or against the strategy would be
4843.84s:  helpful. I agree with you. I think the problem is even for like most of the group here, especially
4853.44s:  for like the beginners. I don't actually think that would be super useful for a beginner series,
4860.32s:  at least until like the very end because the problem with that is it's kind of like if you watch
4867.92s:  a really good jujitsu player. And from the perspective of a jujitsu player, if you're working with
4878.80s:  a black belt, a lot of the things that a black belt might do actually can be anti-fundamental.
4887.52s:  They know different areas and elements that they can break rules and why in a certain situation
4894.08s:  a rule might be broken. So for the overwhelming majority of people, specifically from
4903.92s:  our community that especially come to these sessions, right, the trading basics and for beginners,
4910.40s:  is I actually think it would be way, way, way better time spent talking about things like
4918.48s:  understanding profit mechanisms or tracking profit mechanisms. The problem with that
4925.04s:  and I've already identified this is that there literally is an element of it that just comes down
4931.76s:  to doing the work. And I might, my best guess is I think that that's where a big fall off happens
4938.88s:  for a lot of people because a lot of this stuff I think you guys are very familiar with in terms
4945.04s:  of a general process perspective, but then there's the process of actually doing the thing.
4952.64s:  And there's no way, there's no amount of talking about it or discussing around it that will
4957.68s:  substitute for doing the thing. So I'm also cognizant of that trying to make sure that the stuff that
4963.92s:  I'm talking about will help lead us towards the thing. So I think what we might do is all finish
4975.76s:  making the agenda, the syllabus and then it'll break it down into blocks. Normally it's like a 12
4982.08s:  a 12 week thing. So it'll be 12 hours total. I think that's about right. And then I'll split it up
4988.16s:  into 15 minute blocks and then we'll do two to three blocks per. And I'll throw that in the
4995.36s:  discord and see what you guys think. Make sure that it's moving in the correct direction
5000.16s:  and the stuff that will be useful to you guys. So super helpful. I appreciate the input. I'll
5008.48s:  probably ask for some more so that I can make sure that the stuff is solid for you all.
5012.32s:  Right on. I'm going to sign off work on a couple of videos. I will catch you guys tomorrow for
5020.08s:  the GME live stream for those that are going through that. And then if you guys need anything else,
5026.16s:  let me know. Hit me up. Be an outlier. I'll see you all later.
