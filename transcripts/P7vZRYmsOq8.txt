0.00s: I'm going to show you five strategies that I use to trade all market conditions.
5.12s: That's the beautiful aspect of options is our ability to form fit them to the current
10.04s: markets.
11.04s: Like right now it's 2022.
12.40s: It's a bear market.
13.40s: We've had a down year, however, I'm up on the year.
16.44s: And it's not because I'm a magician.
18.16s: It's simply because I have different tools that I can apply to different scenarios.
22.16s: I'm not stuck just doing one or two things, hoping that the market lines up with those.
27.20s: What's up everybody?
28.20s: Eric here.
29.20s: Let's talk about some strategies.
31.24s: So first I'm going to give my stupid face out the way.
33.68s: And we're going to talk about the first one, which is probably not surprising to anybody
37.20s: here.
38.20s: The covered ratio of strangle.
39.40s: You're going to see this term ratio multiple times throughout this.
43.60s: And it's because I purposefully use ratios to create different risk to reward profiles.
49.44s: And this is what I'm talking about.
51.68s: So the first trade we have here is a short put.
55.24s: And this is the payoff.
56.80s: It's a max profit of the credit received.
59.68s: So that's why it has a capped max profit and technically unlimited downside.
63.88s: Now one note on these short puts that I want to make sure it's abundantly clear is I
68.68s: purposely put short puts not cash secured puts.
73.20s: And the reason why I don't put cash secured puts here is because some people think that
77.84s: if it's a cash secure put, then we're parking the cash that we're going to use for that
83.52s: trade.
84.52s: If we get assigned and just waiting to see whether or not that happens, that is not at
88.88s: all what I used to do.
90.72s: At this point, I generally do that because I have enough room in the portfolio.
94.40s: But when I was aggressively growing my account trading things like this, the money that I would
98.64s: earmark to take assignment if I, if the option expired in the money and I received the stock.
105.48s: In that scenario, I would typically have that money out doing something else, whether
109.92s: it's a box spread, whether it's being tied up in another trade and to cover early assignment.
116.36s: If it happened, I would rely on margin for the account pay the interest on the margin
121.04s: until I could free up the capital to bring over to this that I originally had earmarked.
125.16s: So to summarize that when I was aggressively growing the account, my short puts were
130.32s: not sitting there cash secured.
131.96s: I would use the money elsewhere.
133.24s: I would have the money earmarked to use in this trade when I need it.
138.92s: I typically would expect in plan to free up that money towards expiration.
144.84s: So that did leave me early expiration risk and I needed to make sure I had enough room
148.48s: in the portfolio to at least be able to take on the shares via margin.
152.04s: Now let's talk about that scenario.
153.76s: There's two outcomes with this short put.
155.72s: The first one it expires out of the money and you just do it again.
159.20s: Or if it expires in the money and we take assignment that leads to this scenario.
163.44s: And that's what this looks like down here.
165.68s: We have now long stock because we would have bought it at whatever the strike price was
171.00s: keeping the credit.
172.44s: And then I sell calls against it just like a covered call and then additional short puts.
178.44s: So in the scenario, sometimes the short puts go on right away.
181.72s: Sometimes they get layered on later.
182.92s: It all depends on the underlying.
184.68s: But the main thing I'm trying to avoid is this.
187.60s: So in this scenario, I'm pretending that I have 200 shares of long stock and this short
192.92s: put on top of that, we have this one short call.
197.12s: So I have one short call here, 200 long shares over here.
201.56s: And that's why we do not have a cap to upside.
204.80s: Whereas if we look over here, this is using 200 or 100 shares, but the same amount of short calls.
213.00s: So if this is 200 long shares of stock, even with that additional put,
217.56s: this is 200 or two short calls against it.
220.48s: And sooner or later, you're going to cap out your max profit.
222.80s: I don't want to do that.
224.68s: So that's exactly why I trade these as I do without capping the profit potential.
231.08s: So these live within my core allocation, meaning this is really how I make a lot of my
235.96s: money over time.
237.20s: They're bullish in their nature.
239.12s: I want the underlying to go up through all stages of trading this.
243.24s: And I put volatility in different.
246.00s: The reason why I put volatility in different is because when we're selling short puts,
251.12s: if we have higher volatility, it's a good thing because you're going to collect a little
254.32s: bit more money.
255.32s: But it also means that you're going to have higher variance in the underlying movements,
261.44s: which means even though you're getting paid more, you're probably going to have to adjust
264.40s: the trade more frequently as compared to low volatility environment.
268.36s: So it's a trade off.
269.84s: That's why I don't say this is better for high IVP environments.
274.00s: I get paid a little bit more, but there's a diminishing return.
277.60s: So I prefer implied volatility percentile to be maybe 30 to 40 percent, something like
283.52s: that.
284.52s: And as soon as it starts getting over that, I'm going to make more money, but I'm going
288.68s: to have to deal with the trade more.
290.20s: So it's a bit of a delicate balance.
293.32s: And I will trade this strategy, even if implied volatility is low, it's not better for
298.00s: the strategy.
299.00s: It's not the ideal scenario, but because it is a core allocation and because there's a
303.04s: period of time where you have long stock, which doesn't really care about volatility,
306.64s: that is why I label this implied volatility indifferent.
309.88s: All right, let's get on to the next one here.
312.12s: So we have ratio diagonals.
313.80s: Again, that same ratio thing that we're talking about.
317.36s: And this works for calls or puts.
322.76s: And this is how I can easily, directionally trade bull and bear markets.
327.92s: So in this scenario, if we have a trending bull market using the call diagonal gives
333.48s: us upside potential.
335.32s: And again, this ratio is so important because the ratio unlocks unlimited profit potential,
343.24s: whereas if we look at this version with the regular diagonal sooner or later, you find
348.80s: yourself in this scenario where you actually can start losing money.
352.28s: Even though you're a direction that you selected is correct, you can still start losing
356.56s: money.
357.56s: So this is exactly why I prefer to trade them at a ratio.
362.52s: And again, to set up this long call diagonal, typically ratio diagonal, typically I'm
368.24s: going to go further out in time for the long call, like maybe at least 180 days plus.
374.28s: And I'm going to go deep in the money.
376.12s: And then I'm going to sell short calls against it shorter term.
380.48s: And it's the same thing for the put side just inverse.
383.44s: And again, notice how by trading these at a ratio, I have unlimited downside profit
389.32s: potential in this scenario, because this is a bearish play.
392.96s: So sometimes this can live in the core allocation, sometimes speculative for me.
396.64s: I split these up very purposefully.
398.44s: I have a video that will walk through that for those that are interested.
401.24s: I'll throw it in the video or in the video notes below.
404.64s: And then again, this can be bullish or bearish environments.
407.28s: And again, I call this volatility indifferent.
409.88s: I use volatility indifferent because there are tradeoffs here.
413.92s: So the reason the core position here is the long option that's far out in time and deep
421.76s: in the money.
422.76s: Vega or changes in volatility do not impact the price of those options that much.
430.52s: That is the heart and soul of the position.
432.72s: But regardless, the long option is going to prefer in general lower volatility because
438.88s: if volatility expands, you can make money via it.
442.04s: So there's that side.
443.56s: But then we also have the short call or short put that we're selling against the long call
448.36s: or the long put respectively.
450.24s: And that would prefer high implied volatility.
452.72s: So generally speaking, this is going to be your short near term option.
457.76s: It's going to be way more sensitive to changes in volatility.
460.80s: So there's a benefit there.
462.68s: And the longer term options are going to be less sensitive to changes in volatility.
466.48s: So again, there's tradeoffs here.
468.52s: It's different parts of the trade like different changes in volatility.
471.88s: But overall, I will still trade these in varying volatility environments.
476.12s: It's not necessarily the heart and soul of the trade.
479.00s: Let's move on now to the next one.
482.08s: Let's talk about short single options.
484.64s: These take a pretty different shape for me.
487.40s: This is when I want to trade directionally.
490.24s: So if we have a high volatility environment that's trending one way or the other, I will
495.48s: use short calls or short puts to take advantage of it.
498.64s: Now notice in this scenario, I most certainly have a volatility preference.
504.28s: I want implied volatility percentile to be high.
508.00s: And it's because a major part of this trade is the movements in volatility.
514.00s: Whereas with these trades, they have different aspects that benefit from different portions
520.96s: of volatility movements.
523.08s: These not so much.
524.84s: Even though if I sell a short, call a short put, again, there is a higher probability
529.28s: that I'm going to have to deal with it at some point.
531.96s: Because if we have high implied volatility percentile, we're expecting bigger moves, that's
536.60s: a big part of the compensation for these trades.
539.36s: So these are definitely speculative.
541.36s: This is when I want to get directional.
542.92s: And again, if you trade a short call, you're going to be bearish.
545.12s: If you trade a short put, you're going to be bullish.
547.36s: But these normally for me would be traded via margin and not cash secured like the
553.00s: strangle onto the next two more.
556.68s: We have short ratio straddle strangles.
558.40s: I bucket these into the same category essentially because it's a similar concept just like differences.
565.00s: And this is when we're going to sell a call and put typically in the same expiration cycle.
572.88s: If we're doing straddles, it's going to be in the same series and it's going to look
576.64s: like this.
577.64s: It's going to have a peaky top.
579.28s: If strangles, it's going to have more of this flat top.
583.28s: And it's just because for short straddles, we're going to use the same strike, trying to
588.48s: get as close to the same delta on the call and put side.
591.88s: Whereas for the strangles, we typically are going to pick, you know, same delta's, but
598.36s: I'm sorry, the same figure delta, but on the respective side.
602.44s: So for the short straddle, short strangles, I'm sorry, for the short straddles, normally
607.40s: we're going to go right at the money, something like that.
610.20s: For short strangles, I might do a 3040 delta call and a 3040 delta short put.
615.08s: So it's going to put them at staggered strike prices as compared to the straddles.
619.92s: And this ratio, I apply to both.
624.20s: If I have a pure volatility play in my mind, I'm going to gravitate towards a straddle,
631.44s: but if I have a slight directional preference, but I still want to play volatility very directly,
637.88s: I sometimes will skew the straddle less likely than not.
642.04s: More often than not, I'm going to go with strangles if I have some sort of preference for
646.48s: direction.
647.80s: So more often than not, these are going to be speculative trades specifically for volatility,
653.16s: not so much.
654.16s: I don't expect the market to move.
656.52s: And I want you to see this here that really codifies that.
661.04s: I want to see a big variance between implied volatility and historic volatility specifically,
668.12s: where implied volatility is tracking higher than historic volatility.
672.76s: That is the name of the game.
673.92s: We want to sell volatility that is overpriced compared to what's being realized.
679.80s: So this is definitely going to be tied to volatility trading.
684.12s: This is not, I don't have an opinion on where the market's going.
687.28s: So I'm just going to try to be neutral.
689.24s: This is, I have an opinion on volatility and it's that implied volatility is overpriced
693.36s: compared to historic volatility.
694.92s: A lot of people get that mixed up with these trades.
697.08s: They want to just, they can't pick a market direction.
699.72s: So they want to be neutral.
701.20s: But what you are trading volatility with these strategies and you've got to know that.
704.48s: All right.
705.48s: Last one here, long single options.
708.68s: Sometimes I use these if I'm buying units, meaning really far out of the money, long puts,
713.68s: expecting kind of a large movement in an underlying.
717.44s: Or if I want to use leverage to speculate in a direction, but these are more rare than
723.52s: not.
724.52s: A good example for something like this is more often than not, I'm going to end up turning
729.80s: it into a diagonal, but sometimes not.
732.28s: So what I mean by that is I have some long out of the money calls in HUT.
739.60s: I'm not really expecting much out of that trade.
741.96s: This didn't work in my favor, but I used the long calls to essentially serve as my
748.32s: risk management, meaning I had to define risk moving into the trade.
752.32s: It's cryptocurrency.
753.32s: They move a lot and I fully expected it to be a shit show.
756.48s: So I use long call instead of buying the stock and setting a stop.
759.60s: I wanted to give it enough room to move.
761.60s: So in this case, I used options to gain exposure to that.
765.36s: The problem with using long singles to speculate on direction is even though you think you're
769.64s: speculating on direction.
771.56s: You are still speculating on volatility and that cannot be overstated enough.
776.80s: If you are trading long single options just because you want to more efficiently in terms
782.24s: of capital use, gain exposure, directional exposure to an underlying to trade a hypothesis,
788.84s: regardless of how you feel about the direction, volatility still is a big say in this scenario.
793.92s: So in this example, notice what I have down here.
796.28s: I'm not necessarily just looking for low implied volatility.
799.84s: I prefer low implied volatility because similarly to short single options, it will increase
805.44s: my overall profitability if I get an implied volatility movement in my favor.
810.88s: But really what I'm looking for here is a low variance between implied volatility and
816.04s: historic volatility.
817.40s: I don't want to be overpaying for volatility.
820.36s: That is the main thing I'm looking for here.
822.32s: So that's the first threshold.
824.16s: If that can happen and I can also obtain low implied volatility meaning I have room
829.80s: for implied volatility to expand.
831.52s: It's a great scenario to be in, but the main thing is checking out the variance.
834.80s: So these are five of my favorite strategies and their derivatives on how I trade different
839.84s: market conditions.
840.84s: This year it's been a lot of volatility trading for sure.
846.36s: And that's been the hard and sole be between earnings, FOMC announcements, economic announcements,
854.12s: and then still as always running the coverage strangle.
857.80s: I almost always have exposure to the coverage strangle out there because it works so well
861.64s: for me over time.
862.80s: I've developed a great way to manage it.
864.84s: I will link two videos for all of these in the description below so that you can check
868.88s: out any of the ones that you like.
870.28s: Don't forget to subscribe, like the video.
872.56s: See you all later, be an outlier.
