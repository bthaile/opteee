0.00s: What's up everybody? Eric here. Welcome back to the Outlier Pack podcast and I have my friends
6.72s: here from Duneberg and there's no shortage of doom going on in the world today. So there's
12.12s: a bunch of topics I have queued up for us today. But first off, welcome back. It's great
16.96s: to connect with you again. Eric, we'll pledge to be here. Thirdly enjoyed first appearance
21.20s: and looking forward to another fantastic one as we wrap up another interesting week in the
24.60s: world. Yeah, interesting week. I like the framing there.
29.60s: So before we kind of talk about economic events and whatnot, I was right before we started
34.08s: recording. I was talking to you a bit about the post I was reading from you guys from your
38.24s: substack. It's from the second of August. It's called notes on X and it kind of just talks
44.16s: about your guys' experience when Elon Musk took over Twitter and then all the subsequent
48.32s: changes and the impacts that that had to your business. And like I was explaining to you
53.36s: from my perspective, I was kind of just watching the show because really there's very little
58.64s: impact to me, but reading your perspective was very eye opening on how like jarring a lot
65.12s: of that was. So I actually had a few follow on questions, but kind of to level set with
69.72s: the broader audience, what's like the high level impact in case somebody didn't catch
75.08s: that article, which I will link for them to check out. Yeah, sure. We're professional
80.04s: content creators now doing burgers the work of our lives. This is how we make our living,
84.88s: how we feed our families and support our sort of economic well being. And when the new
89.68s: owner of Twitter took over, he had at least in secret, but then eventually made public
98.04s: that he viewed substack as one of the key potential future competitors to Twitter and
102.60s: what he envisioned Twitter would be, which is fine. He's the owner of that platform.
107.32s: It's his private property. He certainly paid enough for it, paid enough for it to have
111.44s: the right to do what he wants with it. And so it began with some fraudeling of substack
117.04s: authors and links to substack. And then eventually it just felt like the algorithm was targeting
123.16s: substack in general and then large substack accounts like ours in particular and our impressions
130.80s: and engagement on the platform collapsed, even though we hadn't really materially changed
135.44s: our efforts to try and, you know, to create good content for our followers. You know, at
139.52s: the time that we left Twitter, we had over a quarter million followers. We worked really
143.64s: hard to build up that fellowship to create that account to add value to our followers.
149.76s: And occasionally potentially induced them to come on over to substack and read a piece
154.36s: of ours. And maybe that would eventually lead them to become a subscriber. And, you know,
157.88s: the customer journey and the content space is impression to engagement to email to paid.
161.88s: And we spent a lot of time generating as many impressions on Twitter as we could. But
166.00s: at some point we were into now for a few months. When your impressions claps 90% and you're
171.60s: putting the same amount of effort in, maybe it's time to redirect your effort. And we're a very
174.88s: small team. We have a finite amount of hours in the day. It didn't it became no fun. And so we
181.36s: just laughed. And we decided to go all in on substack, which is, you know, our partners. And,
186.08s: you know, we don't take it personally. Of course, the new owner of Twitter could do what he wants
189.36s: with his platform, as we said in that piece. And, and so, you know, in our mind, substack has been our
194.32s: partners from the beginning. And then like, you know, we would much rather lose with our partners
197.84s: than win with an antagonist in this case. Even if that antagonism isn't personal, it's just
202.64s: business. Yeah. And it's just kind of a disruptor for you guys. One of the things I was curious about
207.12s: is like in the content business, we talked a lot of actually last time about your guys' approach
211.84s: to content. Cause I just find it interesting. But one of the things I'm curious how you guys approach
218.48s: is the idea of like being able to actually, you know, quote unquote own your audience, right?
224.56s: Because as long as you guys exist through these other platforms, that risk always exists. So is
230.88s: that just kind of something that you accept as a potential risk? And then as you are now adjusting
235.28s: as needed? Or is that something that you're thinking further out into and figuring out ways to
239.12s: actually own the relationship with the audience, not through the service of another platform?
244.00s: That's a wonderful thing about Substack is in fact, we do own our audience. We own our email list.
249.12s: It's ours. We could leave Substack tomorrow. And our subscribers wouldn't notice very much.
254.96s: Maybe our email delivery system might change. But we own the relationship with our
260.40s: customers via the payment processor as well. We have a separate account on Stripe, which is the
266.88s: the exclusive payment processor for the Substack ecosystem. And Substack, you know, probably to the
273.28s: chagrin of its investors has been extraordinarily generous with its author partners in that regard.
279.76s: They've always viewed their job to more than delight us. And in exchange, we would stay with them
286.80s: because it's a great deal. And frankly, it is a great deal. You know, somebody posted on notes,
290.32s: which is Substacks version of Twitter that we now post exclusively on. Asking us whether we pay
296.40s: the full 10% to Substack and boy, that sure seems like an awful lot for, you know,
303.44s: basically in editing software and a mailchimp knockoff. And we said, yes, we do. And it's worth
308.32s: every penny because it's way more than that. There are business partners and their 10% is what we
314.48s: agreed to pay them in the event that we succeeded. And we're not, you know, we're people of our word.
319.28s: But beyond that, Substack has 30 million emails in its ecosystem. And it has really great
323.76s: discoverability tools. And it's starting to gain critical mass. You know, their mission is to change
328.96s: the way people read on the internet and to improve the tone of discourse online. And if you are
335.68s: paying subscriber to Bloomberg, you get access to our comments section. And with every piece of
339.68s: e-write, we get hundreds of really intelligent links and questions. And I'm on there all the time.
345.84s: I'm personally answering every comment. And they know like it's the Bloomberg head writer that is
353.04s: also engaging in the comment section. And then we have almost 200,000 emails that on our subscriber
360.32s: list. That's an audience that, well, we don't own, but we have, we own the right to delight them.
366.40s: And we certainly have direct access to them. We can email them directly. And I think Substack is
372.00s: changing the way social media properties interact with their main contributors. You know, there's
379.68s: three types of people on social media, the sort of the lurkers and the occasional contributors.
385.28s: And then sort of the power years, the creators. And you need a critical mass of creators for a
391.12s: social media platform to work. Like if Facebook or Instagram or nothing more than just your friends,
396.56s: it'd get pretty boring after a while. But you can go and you could follow celebrities and
400.24s: athletes and musicians and experts in various fields and interact with them directly, which is
405.92s: the magic of social media. It's also the thing that makes Twitter a little bit toxic.
412.96s: And so, yeah, that it really is an amazing thing that Substack is trying to do. We certainly hope
416.80s: they succeed where investors and Substack. And obviously we're all in.
421.44s: Yeah, yeah, it's awesome. And that's kind of one of the reasons why I wanted to dive into that
425.12s: question. Because Substack is one of those interesting platforms where exactly to your point,
429.52s: it seems like there's a portion email list that you guys don't out right. And then, you know,
434.24s: there's still pieces that go through the platform, like the note section and whatnot.
438.96s: So it's very interesting to me to understand how you view those different kinds of
443.60s: interactions with your audience and where you're waiting your efforts and how you view some
448.08s: Substacks capacity to deliver on that. So, let's take let's take you, for example, I mean,
453.12s: you could deliver your podcast through Substack. And in so doing, you would collect emails
460.08s: of people who are interested to hear your podcast. And that as a creator, an email is way more
466.24s: valuable than a follow or a subscribe on YouTube, for example. And so I don't know why anybody who's
472.40s: on YouTube isn't also on Substack because you get, you know, basically, you get this amazing
479.84s: direct contact with people who are self-identifying as wanting more of your content.
485.12s: You know, and so it's really, I think, a magical place and to be clear, Substack has a far more
495.92s: cultural alignment with freedom of speech than the traditional social media platforms. They're
502.88s: very hesitant to censor or to remove content. You know, we curate our own comment section,
510.56s: for example, because it's, you know, behind a paywall and so it's a lot easier to handle.
515.60s: We like to say you control us, but you have to pay for the privilege. But like we will occasionally
520.88s: delete a comment that's out of line. We don't want to be the owners of our subscribers comments,
526.64s: but at the same time, like we want our comment section to be a curated place of learning
531.76s: and engagement and by and large, that's what it is. And it's really a wonderful thing. And so like,
535.28s: if I were you, I would be distributing your podcasts as video through the Substack platform and
542.32s: dub and identifying the people who really want to, you know, circumvent the YouTube algorithm and
548.32s: contact them directly. Yeah, yeah, it's actually a really interesting idea from my perspective,
553.92s: because exactly you're talking about one of the cool parts I've found with the podcast in general
558.24s: is the ability to put it a bunch of different places. Like I just started putting it on Spotify and
562.64s: what not because it's no extra work. It's just uploading another spot. But it's a good point.
568.16s: So pivoting over now kind of to what the world looks like today. If you were to summarize the three
578.80s: largest global factors that are of interest to you guys, what are they and why?
585.28s: Number one, the situation in the Middle East and whether or not the war spreads beyond Gaza,
590.16s: I think that's the most urgent, important, difficult to take apart as an outsider,
596.56s: you know, the geopolitical risk on the board. You know, whether it has been off of the North and then,
601.44s: you know, the US and in Syria and then maybe, you know, Lindsey Graham gets us where we start
606.32s: carpet bombing Iranian oil facilities and all bets are off, I think, for, you know, for risk
612.88s: in the markets and in particular oil, of course, and then the commodity markets. Number two is the
619.36s: war in Ukraine. I think very few people have on their, on their scorecards here at the potential for
630.00s: a collapse of the Zalinsky regime. It's not something we've written about, but it's something we've
634.16s: been studying and potentially thinking about writing. I think things aren't going nearly as well
639.44s: in Ukraine as the West would have us believe. And I think that these types of things tend to resolve
648.32s: at a speed that surprises people no matter how many times it happens. And then third is obviously
653.76s: the tensions between China and the US. I were paying close attention to the prospect of
658.00s: the Xi Jinping flying to San Francisco here for a conference, which would be, I think, potentially
664.56s: a positive development, but the tensions over Taiwan, the chip wars, tit for tat, trade war that
671.60s: seems to be escalating, but still simmering a little bit below the kinetic surface, as we might
676.96s: say, those are the three things in order. I think we're one headline away from, you know,
682.00s: catastrophe in the Middle East. I think the Ukraine war is putting Europe in a very, very bad situation.
688.80s: And then obviously, if the US and China could resolve their tensions, that would obviously be bullish.
694.56s: So we shall see. But those are the three just off the top of my head first time here in the question
700.00s: that we would be paying very close attention to. Got it. Well, if I could give myself a score,
706.96s: I got two out of three. So the first one I wrote down that I wanted to talk to you about was
711.60s: Israel Hamas, the second one was Russia, Ukraine. I did not include China, US, I missed that one.
717.92s: But I'm pretty stoked. I got two out of three. What did you include? Just out of curiosity,
723.04s: might be our fourth. So after that, I have fed rate policies recession, energy war fair,
730.08s: because I really like that article that you guys wrote. Those were the next kind of handful that
735.12s: I had listed out. Yeah, yeah. Well, let's take him in order. Where do you want to go?
740.24s: Yeah, well, definitely Israel first. And the reason why definitely Israel first is because like,
746.08s: I'm still in the reserves. So I follow this stuff very closely, obviously. And the overall
752.96s: relationship there is so fascinating to me against the backdrop of the typical American perspective,
759.12s: which not to talk down about ourselves, but it tends to be pretty ignorant. I feel like
764.40s: Americans are used to being in our own little bubble. And we sometimes forget that other people
770.08s: have other perspectives. So looking at what's going on over there, I think is very important, but also
778.72s: misunderstood by a lot of people. So can you talk from your perspective what's going on there
786.00s: and then the potential larger scale impact? So I think it's very important to state a front, but
791.12s: I know I am not an expert on the Israeli Palestinian conflict. I'm superficially knowledgeable
798.32s: about it. And I think it's important when analysts are on podcasts like this to state a front,
803.68s: whether they have any particular expertise to add. So for example, I'm far more comfortable
807.92s: pontificating about the nuances of, you know, LNG market and natural gas, then I am about the causes
815.44s: and consequences of the most recent events in Israel. Now, of course, any outside human can look
821.36s: at this situation and be appalled at the events of October 7th, and we certainly work. And also be
826.72s: afraid of the risks involved and that this is a very, very serious event. And I think that the commodity
834.64s: markets in particular might be underpricing the tail risk of a spreading of this war in the same
841.52s: way that it did in the weeks ahead of Putin's initial moves on Ukraine. And we are, of course,
849.04s: we're defensive pessimists and we pondermers case narrow risks. And so when situations like these
854.24s: explode, we are of course, our instinct is to pondermers case narrow risk. We are looking
860.56s: closely at escalation on the north, it has a lot. And with Iran via proxies in Syria initially,
868.88s: but whether that kinetic battle, you know, spreads to direct conflict with Iran, obviously,
875.92s: there's some very narrow straits over there through which an awful lot of energy is shipped. And if
880.96s: those were to be interfered with, it could cause huge dislocations in the market. I have no idea how
887.60s: to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I think it is a tragedy of epic proportions. It is,
895.44s: you know, it is really just, it's just no other way to say it. It is sad that in 2023, humans are
904.24s: still capable of doing that to each other, what we saw in the seventh, for example. And it's disturbing.
911.68s: Well, Israel's response and whether they've gone too far in the humanitarian crisis and whether
916.88s: we get a pause or a ceasefire, these are all well beyond our expertise to really go into any great
924.16s: detail. And I just think it's important to say that, like, I don't know. But I do know that if
928.80s: conflict spreads, the consequences would be devastating and swift. And the transfer mechanism
934.32s: through which the economic impacts would spread to the rest of the world are pretty well known.
939.84s: So one of the things we did write about, though, was to contribute a piece about the US political
944.88s: situation and how the divided House, you know, the Republican Party's divisions could actually choke
951.04s: off supply of funds and military equipment to Ukraine, which in fact has played out since we
956.72s: wrote that piece. I believe it was called minority report. It is just undeniable that in the US
964.00s: domestic political situation, which we do know something about support for Israel is far far more
968.96s: uniform and united, let's say, and strong than it is for Ukraine. Ukraine has become a political
976.48s: battleground for the 2024 elections. The Republicans, many of whom, you know, for whatever motivation,
983.68s: wouldn't mind hanging a loss on Biden ahead of the 2024 elections. And I think the need to supply
990.56s: arms and funding to Israel is great cover for them to choke off supply to Ukraine. And that's what
995.12s: we're seeing. And in the piece minority report, we mentioned how Pelosi had kind of stabbed McCarthy
1001.28s: in the back. And that was a decision that she might come to regret because whoever would replace him
1004.64s: would be less malleable than McCarthy on these issues. And of course, we see that McCarthy's
1009.68s: replacement is in fact very much further to the right than he was and looks less ready to cut a
1014.40s: deal on Ukraine. So that's the extent that the Middle East impacts Ukraine and that's a domino
1019.76s: that affects European energy. There we can begin to be more comfortable about speculating, but
1024.24s: you know, how the decades-long conflict between Israel and Palestinians, you know, resolves is
1029.60s: well above our favorite. Yeah, well, and I always try to remind people that although we have like
1035.44s: this veneer of civility conflict has always been there, I don't see it going anywhere. I see
1041.84s: a continuing to change and evolve, but you know, like you were saying, it's kind of like sad and
1046.40s: appalling. And I totally get that perspective. I think from at least from a military standpoint,
1051.60s: none of this is shocking. It's kind of slightly different than what we've seen before as it
1056.16s: typically continues to be, but humans are humans. Now, you mentioned one thing that I do want to
1063.04s: dive a little bit further into on that first topic, though, is kind of the potential for the conflict
1068.40s: to spread. Do you have any hypothesis on primary catalysts for that or what that could look like if it
1075.12s: were to play out? Well, it should be said, and I hope this isn't controversial. There is a
1080.32s: faction in the US that really wants war with Iran and has wanted war with Iran for a very long time.
1086.88s: The Neocon wing of both parties, frankly, I think it is bipartisan. The Hudson Institute crowd has
1094.08s: been angling for conflict with Iran for some time. I don't know why. Seems like a full hearty
1100.96s: endeavor. You know, I don't know how many wars we need to lose before we decide that maybe we
1106.24s: should be more selective in engaging in wars. The Ukraine situation is not going well. This comes
1113.36s: on the heels of the, I think, scandalous exit from Afghanistan and the situation in Libya and Iraq.
1120.64s: I mean, it's for all of the heroics and the sacrifice of the US soldier, what do we have to show
1128.08s: for the sacrifices? Is that a conversation we need to have? And so I would argue that while we
1134.64s: are engaging in a proxy war with Ukraine and provoking a trade war with China, is it really smart to
1140.32s: open up a kinetic war with Iran? I mean, I don't know. Maybe I'm just a pacifist. I'm old enough
1146.24s: to remember when being in the pro-Pace camp was considered liberal, almost borderline treacherous,
1152.72s: and now it's considered alt-right Putin puppet. I don't know. As the father of draft elbows
1159.68s: of old children, I would prefer that at least we had a debate in Congress before we declared war.
1166.00s: And we thought about the consequences, the objectives and the limits that we would place on
1171.04s: the military as we engage in these things. But there's a faction of people in the US that want war
1174.96s: the Iran. And I think away this war spreads as we provoke them or we have sort of a gulf
1182.80s: thunken incident where something happens and gets blown up by propaganda. Next thing, you know,
1187.60s: the war cries are whipped up internally. And off we go, and sad. I'm on a bash of the pro-Pace,
1197.20s: on a bash of the pro-U.S. I think it'd be really great if our national defense focused on defending
1204.08s: us, as opposed to proactively finding wars to go and drop bombs on people. You know, I guess when
1209.36s: you're in the bomb making business, peace is a working capital problem. It's sad. But you know,
1214.56s: and I'm sure we'll catch some plaque for saying these things, but we would be very much inward
1219.52s: focused in our resource deployment, investing in our domestic economy on our domestic entitlements,
1227.52s: our domestic border security, and letting the rest of the world figure out what they want to do with
1232.00s: each other. Yeah, it's an interesting perspective. So do you guys think that there's a way to operate
1238.72s: in isolationism like that? Because when I hear those kinds of things, I honestly don't have much of
1244.40s: a perspective myself. I genuinely view myself as too ignorant to have an educated opinion on it.
1249.28s: I always just look at the problem set and think how tricky it is. The balance, internal,
1255.04s: internal investments in internal infrastructure and internal focus versus forward projections
1261.60s: for the purpose of internal loke, I have control. So I'm curious how you guys think about like that
1268.32s: isolationism concept and the ability to look more inward. And I don't want to say for sake, but
1274.32s: metal less externally. I think look, you could forget about just isolating the country. You could
1280.64s: say the Western hemisphere is off limits. We could easily enforce that. If you do a circle around
1286.40s: NAFTA, I mean, there's plenty of food and fertilizer and water and resources and oil and gas and coal.
1295.36s: I understand that we have allies around the world and that we have principles and so on.
1299.52s: But at some point, if we're not going to be the global superpower, which we're kind of pulling back,
1308.56s: we're sort of sending mixed messages to the world, right? I mean, we're pulling out of these places,
1312.96s: but at the same time, we are sort of commanding and demanding the same level of respect
1317.84s: that we used to have when we were truly dominant super power. And I would argue that we have underestimated
1324.96s: the military might of our opponents. And it's okay to treat other cultures as people to deal with
1332.72s: sort of on a peer basis. I don't, I'd be hard pressed to believe that the rest of the world
1337.76s: makes up every day looking to go to war with the US. And maybe I'm naive and look, it's totally
1343.36s: possible naive. And I'm sure there are people listening who will say that. I think we've got plenty
1347.84s: of problems at home before we go about the world searching for other people's problems that solve.
1355.44s: I don't know, that's just me. Do you think that's what the US is doing, that they're trying to look
1359.84s: to solve other people's problem for them? Or do you think that it's more the US is looking to
1365.60s: interfere in other places and solve problems that might come back and impact us?
1371.28s: Well, that would be the Neocon argument that you know, better to fight over there than fight over
1375.04s: here. I find that argument unpersuasive. But again, nobody comes and do bird to read these things.
1380.80s: This is not really in our zone of expertise. I'm more expressing my personal opinion.
1384.32s: Yeah, of course. And then anything we would write about. But that's the argument that the Neocons
1388.56s: make is best to fight Iran and Iran. And my thought would be how about we just don't fight Iran?
1392.40s: Like how about we figure out a way to reach some kind of a workable relationship with Iran with China,
1396.80s: with Russia having for a bit. But there's the view that all of these countries are out to get the
1404.48s: US and that we need to practically go in. But what's the end point? Like we're going to
1409.04s: nuke all these people? What is the end point of a war with Iran? You tell me like what does victory
1414.08s: look like in that scenario? Iran is the largest producer of oil for China right now. China's
1420.40s: important, the largest importer of oil into China comes from Iran today. That's new,
1423.84s: a recent development. We go to war with Iran. What do you think China thinks when it looks at
1427.52s: Taiwan and it looks at its internal strategic petroleum reserves? Like how many wars do we want?
1432.80s: Like to what end? What's the point? Like it's called national security. Does this improve or decrease
1437.92s: our national security? I don't know. I mean at some point we need to have a conversation. Like again,
1444.48s: how many wars do we want to lose? It's not like we have a glorious track record since Vietnam in this
1449.68s: regard. Find me a place in the world where our military action resulted in a better situation that
1456.08s: exists today. Look at at least at the end of World War II, look at West Germany and Japan and
1460.64s: the reconstruction of Europe. Those were wars worth winning and we meaningfully invested in
1467.60s: the longevity of the outcome. What's Afghanistan today? What's Iraq today? How many trillions do we
1474.24s: spend on these wars? I don't know. But again, our views on this aren't going to change. That's
1481.84s: where I would lie personally. Yeah. Yeah. No, I ask the questions because I find it interesting.
1487.20s: That's the whole idea is to promulgate different perspectives and to learn more. I think a lot of what
1491.84s: you say is there's a lot of great thought behind it in my opinion. I agree with you. I think the idea
1497.44s: of like starting conflict for the sake of it doesn't necessarily help most people, which is always
1502.80s: why I go back to like I'm curious always like what the the true undertones are. And if it's kind of
1507.60s: what what you're talking about in very well could be the case where it's just the large war machine
1513.12s: needs conflict for profit. Yeah. Like that that very well has a big seat at the table. You can go
1520.96s: back to Dwight Eisenhower's outgoing speech and look what a great president he was. We have the
1525.36s: national highway system because of the same man who was pivotal to us winning World War II.
1531.28s: And in his outgoing speech, what did he warn about? He warned about the situation we're in today.
1535.52s: Now we have a we have these wars are undeclared by the way like I forget I know it's like probably
1539.76s: just a detail, but the the Constitution says that Congress declares war like when when when the
1546.08s: Japanese attack Brawl Harbor, you know, FDR went to Congress and asked for declaration of war now
1550.88s: he got it and people were lining up around the corners to to volunteer for the Navy and for the Army
1556.16s: and and so on and and great that's all put you know aligned with the Constitution today. We the
1561.76s: president basically has the power to to to act in a way that amounts to undeclared wars. And I
1569.60s: just don't think that's the way the country was founded and was meant to be we should be debating
1573.36s: these things. Our Congress men and women and our senators should be putting their names to a vote.
1579.52s: Do we want to go to war with Iran? Okay, what are our objectives? What what is the outcome? What's
1585.60s: the definition of victory? I think of Colin Powell with with the war in Iraq. I mean, whatever you
1590.72s: think of Powell and you know, it's subsequent speech in front of the United Nations and all that
1594.88s: in the first Gulf War. I mean, it was very clear. These were our missions. Now look, we didn't
1600.16s: handle the victory very well, but at least from a most rare perspective. It was very clear.
1604.64s: What we had a vote, by the way, it was a controversial poke and how people voted mattered over time.
1610.08s: Now we just we've done away with all of these formalities as though they were irrelevant and this
1615.20s: is a disturbing trend they interview. If the president can just randomly decide to emperor
1620.24s: the US and various conflicts around the world with basically minimal oversight from Congress,
1624.08s: that's a very dangerous situation. Leads me to another question I have for you. And again,
1628.88s: I know this is this might be a little farther outside of your typical preferred wheelhouse,
1633.60s: but it is something I just personally am trying to understand better is this increase in like the
1641.04s: use of impeachment. I was reading a couple articles yesterday about, you know, people attempting
1646.80s: to start the impeachment process for Biden. Have you seen me did all that for Trump? Do you have an
1652.64s: opinion or any thoughts on the increase of use of that as a political tool? Sure. It's bad.
1662.00s: Yeah, they impeached Trump twice. Once over Ukraine, ironically, as you may recall,
1665.84s: I'm like an afterthought now seems like a lifetime away. I do think this all of course goes back
1672.64s: to Clinton and his refusal to resign. And he stuck it out and he quote unquote one, but did the
1678.72s: country lose. There was a time when politicians who were caught up in such scandals resign and
1685.68s: that was considered the honorable thing to do. And Clinton didn't and he fought impeachment,
1690.40s: anyone. And unfortunately, I think the the weapon of impeachment has become desensitized in the
1698.80s: eyes of the voting public and our hyper polarization of our politics means that whoever is doing the
1705.84s: impeaching is just viewed by the other side as being, you know, seeking point scoring against the
1713.20s: other team. So I would argue there is no crime a president commit today that would convince his
1719.52s: his or her party that that is worthy of impeachment because it's just been desensitized.
1725.60s: The Democrats will land up behind Biden no matter how much evidence of corruption in Ukraine is
1729.60s: on earth. And the Republicans will line up behind whoever might be their next president in a similar
1738.40s: circumstance. And then we have lost sadly, we have lost the ability to objectively
1747.20s: use tools like impeachment for their intended purpose, which is to rid our politics of corruption.
1753.52s: But our politics are so corrupt that it's laughable. And impeachment is no different than
1760.72s: the knock them out, drag them out, wars over Supreme Court appointees. There's just another partisan
1767.92s: battleground and people will be impeached for no good reason and people who should be impeached
1773.44s: remove from office will survive because the tool has law. The knife is dull. It has been improperly
1779.76s: used and has converted into yet another partisan, you know, just like in distinguishable from battles
1786.32s: over redistricting, you know, redistricting of elections and so on. It's just another
1791.92s: tiresome team sport food fight.
1796.48s: No, it's kind of the answer I was expecting you to say, but I was hoping that there was something
1803.28s: I wasn't considering. But yeah, pretty. Sorry to let you down.
1809.44s: I sometimes I do realize that I look at some of this stuff with like rosy glasses hoping that
1815.44s: there's just something purposeful that I'm just not seeing. But yeah, that sounds about right.
1823.12s: You mentioned before I want to skip number two for a second, which is Russia Ukraine, and I want
1826.88s: to go right to number three, which is kind of US China and Taiwan. That relationship continues to
1834.24s: be fascinating to me. Obviously, the US is very interested in Taiwan for the semi conductor business,
1839.20s: which they're actually talking about and creating incentive is an infrastructure to start localizing
1844.64s: here in the US. How do you think that that impacts the relationship with the US and China specifically
1850.32s: as it pertains to Taiwan? I think it is incredibly difficult to replicate what Taiwan does in the
1856.48s: semi conductor space. I think the secret sauce involved in effectively running a semi conductor
1863.12s: supply chain is vastly more difficult than anybody over here even can begin to understand. I've sold
1869.68s: into that market. I understand it pretty well when I was in industry. The secret is in the humans
1875.92s: and in the technicians and that's just it's not like you can write down a set of standard
1879.84s: operating procedures that you can copy and paste and build a plant in Milwaukee and suddenly you're
1884.96s: up to speed in competing with the Taiwanese with respect to semiconductors. It is truly a point
1892.88s: source of vulnerability for the global economy that even China itself who's spending tens if not hundreds
1898.16s: of billions of dollars trying to replicate it can't quite do it. In fact, of course, it's in Taiwan's
1904.56s: interests have not really landed on what else replicated because if anyone else could do it, then there's
1908.32s: no urgent need to defend Taiwan against an incursion from China. But I would say the one thing
1915.92s: that I see missing from the discourse is just how incredibly difficult it would be to do this.
1921.60s: In fact, I would argue the vast majority of money allocated in the US for this exercise will
1927.04s: be totally wasted. Which I have an answer for you. Do you think it's potential for the semi conductor
1935.84s: industry to even be moderately effective here in the US? Do you think that kind of where Taiwan is
1942.08s: so far ahead that it's just a fool's errand in total? Well, you know, in design, we're very strong,
1948.80s: of course, but China is trying to catch up, which is why we wrote this piece about the RMIPO and
1954.00s: Massa Sun's dropping of bags on Western investors because basically,
1959.28s: RM China has been confiscated by the Chinese government even though it's undeclared.
1964.08s: And so the closing the gap on design is a lot easier. You could steal that IP than it is on the
1973.04s: fabrication side of things. And that's where it is still very much a magic and an art. It is
1980.08s: difficult for people to just assume this is just another production process that can be copied.
1984.64s: And it just isn't this is just not how senate conductors work. And we've been researching a piece
1989.36s: on this for some time. Can't quite figure out how to add a unique angle to it that isn't already
1994.00s: out there. We might just highlight this and a few other things that we know about the sector. But
1998.48s: it's very, very difficult to replicate what Taiwan has. And if war does break out and those
2002.64s: facilities are damaged, for example, you're going to see catastrophic consequences for the global
2006.24s: economy. What makes it so difficult? Because I think about what the US can produce
2014.64s: I think about a lot of the just insanely complex intricate items that we're able to make now.
2021.76s: What makes what Taiwan is doing so difficult to replicate?
2026.96s: It's the yield. You're talking about nanometer level features that you're
2031.60s: you know, etching onto super pure silicon wafers. And that there's just an institutional knowledge
2039.68s: that is built up. It's literally master mechanics. Renching on complicated cars is the best
2047.04s: analogy that that you know, there's just certain people that know when you hear the tone of a knock
2052.48s: exactly what's going on and where to wrench. And it's that way. And of course a lot of this is kept
2059.12s: in house inside these companies as trade secrets. And they would never put it in a pattern because
2063.36s: that's just something that makes it easier for people to steal. And so it is just
2069.92s: if you've ever been to one of these, you know, the astronomical lengths that one has to go
2078.00s: in order to produce semiconductor chips of some reasonable yield and purity with some economic,
2085.20s: you know, efficiency. You're talking amongst the most sophisticated industrial processes that
2092.64s: humankind runs. And so it might feel impressive to go to a factory that makes very high
2098.16s: precision screws. Right. But this is a whole nother plane Eric. And it just it just is decades
2105.52s: of institutional knowledge in the hands and minds of a very small number of people that has passed
2111.92s: down and apprentices and so on. And and the cultural barriers to translating that knowledge from say
2118.64s: a laboratory technician in Taiwan, which by the way has a whole different definition and
2123.76s: and sort of societal pedigree than a laboratory technician might have even in Switzerland or
2129.60s: or in the US. And so it's just very, very challenging. And so I only point that out not to say
2134.40s: it's impossible, but to say the timelines that our planners are anticipating that they might be able
2139.20s: to close that gap, I think are vastly optimistic. And and this is a known issue for anyone in and
2146.00s: around the industry for for the better part of decades. Like it just is really hard to do. And
2150.24s: that's why Taiwan does it so successfully because this is their part of the value chain that they
2155.28s: have mastered. Right. Yeah. Makes tons sense. It's funny because I've done a bunch of bunch of
2161.12s: homeworks. I used to invest a lot in things like Intel AMD so on and so forth. So I spent a lot of
2167.84s: time learning about just the world of chip making. So I think the way that you described it there,
2173.12s: though, is really understandable for people. So thanks for going into that that detail.
2177.36s: Because I think that that is really important for people to grasp, especially as I look at
2182.56s: the relationships between US and China, a lot of people I hear will say something as,
2187.28s: well, why don't we just make them here? Right. And I think you very,
2191.92s: very eloquently summarize why that is so difficult. So I think it's just a good perspective to get out.
2198.16s: So on that same thread, though, what does the relationship now with the US and China look like
2206.16s: going forward? I think much depends on the upcoming potential, you know, meeting between
2211.28s: G and Biden. If it happens in San Francisco, mixed signals in that regard, we would hope that there
2219.60s: would be a path for de-escalation. But we have we have ceded control of choke points in our
2226.00s: economy to China. This is not a secret to anybody. The de-industrialation of the US has come at
2232.48s: the expense of our capacity to manufacture and has benefited China. Geopolitically, we wrote a piece
2238.08s: called geopolitical warfare where we talked about how China allowing its domestic manufacturers the
2242.96s: right to pollute with a band-in has caused sort of a crowding out of good manufacturers from the
2248.72s: market. Because if you're, I would like to say, if your competitors idea of a water treatment
2253.12s: plant is a pipe to the river, you have no hope of competing on cost. And Western buyers of commodity
2259.44s: goods don't really care about such things, even though they like to proclaim their environmental
2263.44s: bonafides and they have really fancy nice booths at COP28. And they talk about how, you know,
2268.80s: they have these great sustainability programs. For five cents a pound, they will they will take all
2272.80s: of your volume and give it to the dirtiest producer in China. And they just don't care. I mean,
2277.36s: it's all off the side. It's all BS. And so China has used this to their advantage and has rolled up.
2283.36s: For example, China processes 100% of the world's rare earth metals. So even if we have a rare earth
2287.92s: metal mine in the US, that material must be shipped to China for processing before we can be used
2292.32s: in a magnet or an electric motor or things like that. Everywhere you look, China has essentially
2298.56s: monopoly control in key choke points, same thing with solar. They own 97 plus percent of the
2304.08s: Ignat forming and wafering and sell mounting markets, which means the three remaining polysidic
2310.00s: complaints in the US have to ship the material to China for further processing. So we have given
2314.24s: China control over these key monopoly choke points. And it's almost predominantly because they allow
2320.88s: their domestic producers to pollute. And we don't because we care about the environment. And
2326.80s: our proposal wasn't that we should allow our domestic producers to pollute. Our proposal was
2332.56s: that we should offset the cost of installing world-leading pollution controls so that they can
2337.92s: compete on a level playing field with the Chinese manufacturers because the ability to pollute
2342.64s: amounts to an illegal and undeclared subsidy for their domestic manufacturers. And so China is
2347.68s: willing to degrade its environment in order to gain geopolitical power against us and they do
2352.08s: so routinely and it's high time. We wake up to this fact and do something about it.
2357.84s: I agree and I see your perspective on China improving its position. What are your thoughts though
2363.44s: on the areas that China is still reliant on the US for? The reason why I ask is because I think
2370.64s: when I look at the relationship between the US and China and the potential conflict in Taiwan,
2375.12s: in my perspective, I always viewed it as a low probability event because of still yet how intertwined
2381.68s: the US and China are reciprocally. Does that impact or do you have any thoughts on that specifically?
2387.76s: Sure. The number one thing that Chinese Communist Party cares about is feeding his people. So obviously
2392.40s: a big vulnerability is food, which is why you see China making strategic moves in the US X sector.
2398.48s: And I think their purchase of Syngenta many years ago should be viewed through that lens. It was one
2402.56s: of our early pieces, almost embarrassed to send out a link to it because we've gotten so much
2408.32s: better at writing these now. China cares very deeply about making sure that everyone's plate
2416.96s: domestically is full. That is the one major point source of weakness. There are others high
2422.96s: in chips, for example, which is why the Biden administration has been trying to ban their export to China
2428.80s: and China has reciprocated by painting things like graphite and there's some talk of rare earth
2434.08s: export controls as well. They have cards to play. We have cards to play. I don't think anybody wins
2438.72s: a race to the bottom. I think, you know, ever escalating economic warfare only leads to
2446.80s: inevitable kinetic warfare, which would be a catastrophe for both countries. So one would hope that
2451.60s: the concept of mutually assured destruction both economically and militarily would allow for
2458.56s: sainter heads to prevail. But again, when you talk about bringing all of these three
2464.48s: potential battles to the same consideration, if the US and Iran get into a hot war, that puts China
2472.16s: in a very prepared situation from an energy perspective and might motivate them to escalate their
2477.36s: conflict with Taiwan and get it done while they still have oil in their reserves. Or
2480.80s: it might have boldened Putin to go even harder in your crane because the US has distracted now
2484.56s: and its limited military supplies are being rerouted to the Middle East. And what does that mean for
2488.80s: Poland and for NATO and for Germany? Because it's all manner of dominoes that get pretty scary to
2493.44s: contemplate, which is, you know, to circle all the way back. Like perhaps we should ponder these
2497.52s: things before we, you know, are so bella coast with people that we should frankly be treating
2502.88s: as peers and not adversaries. You brought up Russia, Ukraine earlier, you brought up the idea that
2512.08s: you felt we might have underestimated or the US is kind of playing down the progression of the
2520.64s: conflict. What makes you say that and what's your perspective on the conflict? So again, not our
2526.80s: primary area of expertise. But if we just compare... I just got to say, it sounds like for the podcast,
2533.68s: I've done a great job spending the whole time talking about self-hands, I can't get an
2539.04s: expertise. I mean, I'm happy to talk about anything, but I just want to make sure the audience
2542.72s: doesn't assume that we have some, you know, some something unique to add other than our personal
2547.52s: opinions. And so I'm very careful to make sure that we, again, if you want to talk to me about the
2551.52s: nuances of the polyethylene supply chain, I'd be more than comfortable saying, yeah, let me tell you
2555.44s: about it. Our view is if you just compare the propaganda of the springtime quote-unquote offensive
2561.12s: to where we are today. And we see the disastrous trip that Zelensky had in particular the Fiasco
2566.56s: and the Canadian parliament, which probably not many of your listeners are aware of, but I think
2571.36s: was a real public affairs fiasco for the war effort. And then the fact that Putin's still there,
2578.24s: our sanctions didn't work as much as we predicted, and we caught a lot of flak for pointing out that
2582.64s: these were terribly designed sanctions that he could easily sort of vent and he has, we haven't
2586.72s: destroyed the Russian economy. Putin is still wildly popular within Russia. And then just saying
2593.68s: these things, of course, gets you in trouble over here, which is another sign. Like if we were so
2597.28s: confident in our position, we wouldn't be trying to stamp down people who might have a different
2602.40s: opinion than the consensus. And I think Zelensky, you know, he's been sacking generals recently,
2607.84s: and there seems to be very little progress in this so-called offensive. And frankly,
2614.72s: the war in Israel, and it is a war, it's a declared war really between Israel and Hamas,
2621.44s: is causing the US to redirect its focus and its military supplies to Israel. And that has to come
2628.56s: at the expense of Ukraine. It's not like we have an infinite supply of arrogance. And so I think
2636.24s: time will tell, these aren't things we're hoping for. These are things that we're pointing out as
2640.40s: serious risks given the situations that are unfolding. And by the way, like if we can't supply both
2646.88s: Israel and Ukraine at the same time, what does that mean for our ability to fight a war with a
2650.16s: ran-let alone child? You know, like I think one of the reasons why you don't get in the wars is
2656.64s: is you might lose them. I don't know, it seems very common sense to me, like again. And so I just
2665.60s: think, keep a close eye on Ukraine. That would be my sense. Based on the people that we follow,
2674.00s: and we try to get both sides, and we read the pro-Ukraine Western reports, and we do read,
2680.56s: you know, and listen to a few pro-Russian stuff as well. And I don't think there's anything wrong
2685.20s: with doing that, like you try to get a holistic view and come to your own opinion. Our view is
2690.48s: there's a bit of panic on the Zolensky's team. Correctly so if we were him, we would be rather concerned
2696.32s: as well. You may remember he tried to invite himself to Israel and Israel spurned him. I think
2701.60s: Israel would probably view Ukraine as a threat to Israel's security now because that basically,
2705.68s: whoever gets the weapons wins the wars, and they would be viewing Ukraine as competing for
2712.48s: limited U.S. resources. And there's a view in the U.S. that we could fund all of this and that we
2717.52s: could supply all of this. And maybe we can. I don't know, we shall see, but I would view and put it
2722.88s: away. The least happy person to see a connect conflict breakout in the Middle East, obviously,
2727.68s: besides the direct compatriots and the victims and so on, but from a geopolitical perspective,
2732.56s: that the least happy person to see those events on Zolensky, I just think that's on the diable.
2737.92s: Sure. Yeah, I mean, he obviously sees his resources, potential pull up resources dwindling there.
2742.88s: I think I go back and forth, not that it, my opinion matters either, but I think the progression
2748.96s: of the conflict in Ukraine has been fascinating to me from just a militaristic standpoint.
2754.48s: Because it's funny when you said that we over or underestimated like the military might
2763.04s: of some of these other peers. And I think from a military, militaristic standpoint, most of us look
2768.56s: and we think we're the flock of the Russians. Like we actually are overwhelmingly underwhelmed
2776.24s: with how how they're performing. And that's not to say that Russia doesn't have the capacity
2782.88s: to really do a lot of damage. In my opinion, they've been pulling a lot of their punches because
2789.68s: I at least in my ignorant assessment, I don't think Russia is trying to eviscerate Ukraine.
2794.16s: Yeah. I think that conflict goes down to a cultural level so they're not coming in super heavy-handed,
2799.68s: but still we can glean a lot from their tactics. And a lot of this stuff that we see from both sides
2806.80s: exactly to your point, not just pro-US or pro-Western media, you can see some of the tactics,
2815.28s: techniques and procedures that are deployed. And it's a amateurish at best, which I find very
2821.92s: fascinating. No, good sort of. No, I'm just going to say like these again, well,
2827.84s: beyond you have far more expertise in this area than I would. I wouldn't know a sophisticated
2833.12s: tactic from a Borsh one. I just don't have the knowledge. I would just say I don't think either
2840.24s: side anticipated that we would be where we are some 20 months into the conflict. I think there
2850.08s: were many who expected that Russia would just steamroll, perhaps some even within Putin's inner
2853.68s: circle, and there were many in the West that expected that our sanctions would cause the Russian
2858.72s: economy to collapse and for regime change to occur in Moscow, and that hasn't happened either.
2863.28s: And I think, look, I mean, obviously punches are being pulled because nobody, no nukes have
2869.20s: been exchanged. Like the U.S. has nuclear weapons. Russia has a very vulnerable suite of nuclear
2874.88s: weapons as well. I do think that by definition, as dastardly as this war has been, and as catastrophic,
2886.16s: it has been for the citizens of Ukraine in particular, it could be way worse. I mean, we could be
2892.48s: dropping nuclear weapons on each other. And we're not thankfully. Let's hope that never happens.
2896.64s: But yeah, I mean, I think nobody had on their bingo card that 20 months on, we would be basically
2902.96s: roughly where we were when the war started. I think it goes back to a point you said earlier that
2908.96s: I do find tends to repeat itself when we were talking about semi-conductors in the timeline
2914.56s: that the U.S. laid out for domesticating some of that. I feel like in general, people are far too
2920.88s: optimistic with their timelines. And I think we see this across multiple facets. But to your
2926.08s: point, I agree with you because I think if you ask most people, when does this come to a conclusion?
2933.04s: I mean, the U.S. it's like fly by night, right? As soon as something has been around for a little bit,
2938.08s: we're bored and tired of it. We need something new to focus on. I'm actually curious if you ask
2942.96s: most U.S. citizens if the war in Ukraine is still going on, what they would say. I'm genuinely
2947.20s: curious the answer to that. And I bet you none of them could find for me on a map.
2952.96s: Again, that's not to insult the U.S. public. It just goes to show you how far away all this is.
2957.20s: And look, if you're a citizen of Ukraine, it's outrageous what Putin has done to you.
2963.12s: And the recent turn of events are catastrophic. And again, this is not
2969.20s: what the outcome that anybody's cheering for. But as analysts and realists, you try to figure out
2974.32s: what the answer is going to be and position yourself accordingly. But yeah, it's it.
2978.88s: There are no winners in a war. I mean, who wins in a war? I don't know. Like, you think the Russian
2983.28s: shoulders who have died on the front of Ukraine is fighting people that look and talk like them.
2988.80s: Or winners in this war, of course not. And Ukraine is certainly not winning the war. I don't think
2992.80s: Putin standing in the world has increased because of the war. I don't know. I personally, if I were
2998.80s: a leader on the geopolitical state, which I'm not, I would have a far, far higher bar to connect a
3004.40s: conflict, especially if I was the most powerful military in the world, which the U.S. is.
3012.00s: So that would just be me. Yeah, interesting. We have about a little less than 10 minutes left.
3018.88s: I want to pivot us a little bit more now to kind of future focus. Come into the end of 2023,
3025.04s: we're kicking off 2024. Are those primary focus areas that you outline in the beginning,
3029.60s: your primary focus areas going forward? Or are there other things that you guys are integrating
3034.80s: into your sphere of interest as we enter 2024? Yeah, only to the extent that those three things
3041.44s: influence the energy markets. Obviously, you know, energy is our bread and butter. It's where we
3047.04s: were born and raised. And it's what we write most about. And so our view is predominantly focused
3054.32s: on second and third order impacts of those events, which is the only real motivating reason for
3058.72s: us to try and even get a superficial understanding of them and the potential scenarios. But our
3064.88s: big focus right now is we think we've reached peak ESG. We think the world is embarking on a nuclear
3074.32s: Renaissance. That road won't be without its bombs. And we saw one this week with new scale and
3080.00s: SMRs and so on. But by and large, physics is beginning to reassert itself.
3086.88s: And we recently wrote a piece about how this computing power race, which is of course tied up with
3092.40s: China and semiconductors and data centers and so on, might be the conduit through which nuclear
3098.32s: energy is normalized again in the Western world, not that it ever should have needed re-normalization.
3103.92s: But we talked about how a piece called Fission chips, which is one of our favorite titles,
3111.36s: how artificial intelligence could in fact disrupt the energy markets. And so our objective is to
3117.92s: process the news headlines of the day through the lens of energy for our subscribers.
3125.68s: And we always remind ourselves like nobody goes to the weather channel or geopolitical
3132.00s: pontifications about obscure wars. And people come to do more for energy and we want to delight
3140.24s: our subscribers. And so we do try to focus our thoughts and research on how these second and
3146.72s: third order consequences might find their way back into the energy market.
3152.08s: Right. And I always think it's fascinating to how well markets, specifically commodities markets,
3157.36s: can help us understand just these esoteric, ambiguous problems because to your point,
3165.76s: you can glean a lot of information. And you said in the beginning that you felt the commodities
3169.84s: markets might be underplaying the potential risk. What makes you think that?
3175.04s: I just think if you look at the price action, well, okay, there's two interpretations.
3178.96s: The price action in oil is telling you that war is not going to spread in the Middle East.
3183.12s: Or the price action in oil is underestimating the spreading of war in the Middle East.
3188.64s: And so those who believe that the market is able to foresee such things would say the situation
3198.00s: in Israel's contained. It's catastrophic as it is for the people involved. It's highly unlikely
3204.64s: that it's going to spread to Iran. The Chinese will keep Iran at bay and the US will come to its
3210.08s: senses and realize it has limited aromance and will put on a big show and we have a bunch of
3214.32s: aircraft carriers, you know, over there now, which is one of the greatest assemblies of military
3220.64s: force since the last Gulf War. I'm pretty sure you know when you're following. And so sometimes when
3225.60s: they show up, they, you know, battles just happen to break out because of there, but we shall see.
3229.92s: But the market is telling us that war is not going to spread. I don't know if you disagree,
3234.40s: but oil is down materially from where it was the day before October 7. And so if there was truly
3241.28s: a kinetic conflict between the US and Iran on the horizon, I don't think we'd see WTI in the
3246.56s: high 70s. I just don't see it. Right. And have you, do you guys have any works that you've done
3254.64s: studying the predictive capacity of something like oil against those kinds of conflicts?
3261.04s: See how, yeah, how predictive it is? I mean, it failed in the in the rest of Ukraine war, but at the same
3268.16s: time, you know, I haven't validated it as I've read it in multiple situations, but apparently
3273.04s: the US stock market bottomed out on the day of the battle of midway. Now, again, I've read that from
3280.72s: enough, respectable people, but I have not independently gone and validated that. But nobody knew what
3286.16s: happened in midway for weeks after the battle, right? But the market sniffed it out. So that's
3291.60s: held up as the example of the market being all-knowing. I would argue that the energy market's performance
3297.68s: in the 10 days before Russia rolled into Ukraine was not predictive. And so I guess we'll just have
3305.44s: to see how it does here. I gotta say it's always in absolute pleasure to talk with you guys. And I
3313.92s: know that for this one, I kind of kept you outside your typical sphere of specialty, but
3321.36s: there's a couple reasons why I like to do that, to be honest, because you guys produce a lot of
3324.96s: content in that space already. So a lot of what I like to do is explore some of these offshoot
3331.12s: threads, because I do think very similarly to your perspective in that you can use markets, you can
3336.96s: use commodities to then infer information. And it's really cool to hear what conclusions we arrive at
3343.28s: looking at events through those lenses. So thank you for spending 40 minutes plus walking us through
3349.68s: some of those dots that you connect in the way that you see the world. Awesome. Yeah, I really
3354.24s: appreciate it and really enjoyed it and get in the look forward to a third appearance. Yeah, absolutely.
3358.64s: And then I'll throw a link in the notes below with all of your guys' contact information for
3362.80s: people to reach out to you as they would like. But thanks for hanging out on the podcast. And we
3367.28s: will talk to you again soon.
