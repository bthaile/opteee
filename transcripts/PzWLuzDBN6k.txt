0.00s:  What's up, outliers? Quick market update. We're going to talk a little bit about Siga and
4.90s:  this new monkey box public health concern that's going on. We're going to talk a little bit
9.80s:  about some upcoming earnings in stuff like Cisco, Baba. And that probably get us pretty
17.16s:  good throughout the video today. So let's get straight and we'll talk about GameStop.
21.04s:  My bad at the end, we will absolutely take a look at GameStop. Mostly just because I
24.48s:  started a cadence on it. And once I start something, I just kind of keep doing it.
29.44s:  So that will be here as well. But let's start with Siga. If you'll notice, Siga is up
37.00s:  26.9% on the day, massive massive move. This popped up on a couple of my scans. And why
44.88s:  did it pop up on some of my scans? What really has to do with this uptick in Mpox, so which
54.32s:  is monkey pox, by the way? So if you take a look, this came out earlier and it's essentially
60.20s:  talking about what this whole monkey pox thing is about. I'm going to read because I don't
66.08s:  know exactly what it is. I have an idea, but I'll read to you exactly what it is. It's
69.80s:  an infectious viral disease that can occur in humans and other animals. Symptoms includes
75.32s:  rash that forms blisters, crusts over fever, swollen lymph nodes. It says the illness is
81.72s:  usually mild. And most of the infected will recover within a few weeks without treatment.
88.68s:  Symptoms include rash, fever, exhaustion, swollen lymph nodes, muscle aches, sore throat.
95.20s:  And the medication is, okay, let's see how bad antivirals, that's the easy one to say.
101.76s:  The one that's not easy to say is teco-virumat. See, I'll write that is. I don't feel super
107.48s:  confident there, but essentially it looks like chicken pox, small pox, much less infectious
114.24s:  and it doesn't seem quite as deadly. Now, interestingly enough, though, if you take a look at the
119.72s:  company's siga, it produces an antiviral for it. So that's why it's flying up and off to
127.04s:  the races today. This is one of the really cool things about markets is I just got a refresher
132.20s:  in what monkey pox is. I got a refresher on a company that is performing because of the
138.72s:  new concern that's coming up. And it's all tradable events. So you can see this isn't new news,
146.52s:  right? You can see that going back to the first that there's been some early conversations
151.68s:  about it specifically on the fifth, the World Health Organization warns on a deadly or
156.84s:  strain of monkey pox. And you can kind of see that it's been building over time. The eighth,
163.16s:  it shows plans to declare regional monkey pox outbreak and emergency. And you can kind of see
168.76s:  the way that the stock moves with this news. And then today, it was declared as a public health
176.20s:  emergency. And a coordinated international response is essential to haul outbreak. So tradable events.
183.96s:  These are tradable events to me. I always look for stuff like this because it's a catalyst.
189.00s:  There's movement. It's super unfortunate. I don't want to see monkey pox going crazy. I don't
193.48s:  want to see people going through viral infections and having to endure that. That sucks. But there's
200.20s:  a reality here from the market perspective. And this company builds a potential cure slash solution
208.12s:  for it. And you can see that being reflected here today, the volume was insane at 13 million volume,
215.96s:  where it's 20 day average volume is just what 1.2 million shares up and off up and off to the
225.08s:  races. So this is something you could play a bunch of different ways for something like this.
231.32s:  It looks like a lot of the move probably has happened. If you got into late, for me, when I first
236.20s:  start looking, it's kind of when it breaks above this 10 handle, it looked really interesting.
240.44s:  So that's when I started nibbling. And it's just because I was looking above recent resistance,
245.40s:  at least as far as I could perceive it. This would be a much shorter term trade for me. And I'll just
249.16s:  kind of follow it up. But that's really all there is to this one. It does have options, although
255.88s:  they are grossly illiquid. They're not great. But they can get the job done. If you need some
261.32s:  options in here, you can trade stuff like a ratio diagonal on the call side. That's what I did.
267.24s:  And it's not very liquid, but there's enough to get the job done. That's one of the cool parts
272.12s:  about being a poor retail trader is that you're small enough that you can make stuff like this work
277.72s:  sometimes. So yeah, overall interesting breakout, I guess you could say pun partially intended. And
287.32s:  that is just one idea off of this, but I think it's something to keep an eye on. Now, specifically,
292.92s:  if the deadlier strain starts to take hold, that's really important because we just went through
298.60s:  a global pandemic not too long ago. We know how that goes. So again, it doesn't seem so far.
303.64s:  Like this is anything like that. I'm not here to try to fear monger. I'm just saying it's something
307.88s:  I personally would watch, depending on how the deadlier variant emerges and what that looks like.
313.32s:  In the meantime, you can just play the initial response here. And that's kind of the way that I look
317.48s:  at it. So that is say go now we have to take a look at Cisco. And they just reported earnings and
327.32s:  they came in at 87 cents against 77 70 cents estimate. So they topped expectations pretty well.
337.24s:  And after the market here, they're running 48 bucks when it closed at 45. So this is just a standard
344.28s:  earnings play for me. Nothing sexy in here. I did have a slight bullish skew just because I don't
350.04s:  fear the downside in something like Cisco as much as I fear the upside because if for whatever
354.36s:  reason, this thing decided to really start taking flight, it can get terribly painful. And I mean,
360.44s:  based on where we close today, again, like the open tomorrow, if it stays around where it's at,
363.88s:  the opens up here. So it's a pretty big gap up. But not terrible. Definitely overall manageable
372.20s:  position here. Now the overall earnings though looked decent. I didn't get a chance to go through
378.36s:  all of it, but we can take a look at some of it together here. And let's see. So product sales
385.56s:  came in at 9.86 billion. And it looks like revenue came down just a little bit and it plans a
395.32s:  workforce reduction of 7%. Typically, don't like to see that, but it's typically favorable for the
400.28s:  following quarter. Everything else remaining the same. It does help cut costs. So this isn't
406.76s:  awfully surprising to see here because it is, I mean, if you look at the path of Cisco,
412.44s:  it doesn't look as good as pretty much everything else that's been flying along with this
417.96s:  broader tech headwind. A lot of things, especially in the AI space, have been flying off the charts
424.36s:  here. So when Cisco kind of has this kind of chart configuration, it does cause some questions.
429.72s:  I don't want to necessarily go as far as to say that it gives Intel vibes because this is a
434.76s:  whole other story, which this is again, another really interesting trade that I like down here
438.76s:  for a whole other thing. But Cisco looks like it needs to do something. So the fact that they're
446.12s:  looking at cutting some workforce doesn't holistically surprise me much at all. So it says revenue
452.36s:  for the quarter ending 27 July 13.64 billion, which is down from 15.2 billion year earlier.
460.52s:  And they expected 13.54. So came in a little bit better than expectations. And then it expects
468.28s:  fiscal 2025 non-gap EPS of 352 to 358 and revenue falling between 55 bill and 56.2 bill.
479.80s:  And right now the expectation is 355 and 55.68 billion. So kind of like right in there.
487.08s:  So yeah, that's that. All right, let's now take a quick look at Boba because Boba reports
495.64s:  more morning. And it closed down 2% on the day after hours trading right around 80 so up about 50 cents.
504.84s:  And this one I'm kind of eager to see this is not one I'm trading. And it's primarily because the
511.16s:  last view that I saw, I mean, look at this. This is like just parabolic chop around the earnings.
516.36s:  Look at all of these. It's just kind of madness. If you wanted to go long-vall, this wouldn't be
520.84s:  a terrible spot to do it. I don't think. But long-vall isn't really like through earnings is not
527.40s:  my typical go to. But this does have earnings coming up tomorrow before the open. So it'll be another
533.56s:  one I'm taking a look at because Boba is kind of a good representation just of broader economy and
540.36s:  specifically for China. So I'll use it just for a general proxy on like what they're seeing how
545.72s:  things are going. So that is that for Boba. All right, now let's take a quick pivot to kind of the
551.96s:  broader market. I really want to highlight one specific thing. We don't have to spend a bunch of
555.48s:  time taking a look at this stuff. But let's grab our standard flexible grid here so we can see what's
561.40s:  going on. And again, divergence. That's what I see. Russell rotating down, down day, cues slightly
572.44s:  down. S and P500 up divergence. So what does this mean from a tradable scenario? To me, it's kind of
581.64s:  like watching it unfold until it gets to a point that it starts to become even more appealing.
587.32s:  And the appealing part would be something like short large cap, long, short, long small cap.
593.80s:  I was going to say short cap. I don't know why it doesn't really make sense. So, but being short
599.88s:  large cap, long, small cap. It's been a okay trade, but it's taken a long time to come in. That's
607.64s:  why I'm being a little more cautious in terms of my timing. And I still have my long,
613.24s:  teachable cues position. So it wouldn't be like I'm overall gross short, the large caps. It would
618.68s:  just kind of be a small pair of straight specifically between something like IWM and Spy. But the
623.72s:  relationship between the two of them has been fairly defunct for a while now. So what this means for
628.76s:  me is as I'm watching small caps, it's eyes on small caps. I want to see if it can start breaking
634.20s:  above these levels here. And I just want to see if it can catch a bit. And if it can start
641.48s:  just getting some sort of strength underway because I do still find it interesting that we have a
648.28s:  rate cut that's still projected at 100% coming up and small caps are still just not playing ball
655.64s:  here. I can't help but find that interesting. The other thing I can't help but find interesting is
659.40s:  the fact that the sale volume today was massive. Buy volume was 7.8 million. And the sale volume
665.72s:  was 17.38 million. So that tells me that there's just a lot of repositioning happening by these
672.76s:  larger funds in these really short term time frames, which is kind of crazy. Typically you don't
677.40s:  see it necessarily go down like that. So yeah, I mean, that is part of what's going on here.
683.00s:  Bonds are still ticking up and up and up. So I see them at 124.13 here on ZB. So
690.76s:  broad market is kind of in this weird spot starting to see more divergence is kind of the main
696.44s:  call out here. Now the other thing I want to highlight is this. This is really interesting to me.
703.64s:  So if I take a look at QQQ, which is the NASDAQ at a tiny little bit of a down day today,
710.68s:  volume was mostly by volume 65%. But then take a look at net highs lows. Net highs lows still negative
720.52s:  trending right around negative 56s. Essentially unchanged over yesterday. It was like negative 59
725.88s:  yesterday, negative 56 today. And the gross highs is growing and went from 80 to 101. Gross lows
734.68s:  is also growing from negative 139 to negative 157. This is not super common that you'll see this.
743.80s:  So for me, this is the kind of thing that I will watch and see how net highs lows pans out
750.04s:  specifically in the cues before I start doing a whole lot because again, like this is an
754.76s:  abnormal divergence in the indicator. And it's something that I would want to see how it resolves.
761.72s:  Is it that the general pack of stocks is starting to uplift with just a smaller group of lingering
770.44s:  stocks rotating under could be. But I also care about the change. So day over day, we added 21 highs
780.28s:  and a little under 20 lows. So that is starting to capitulate towards the high side. So I have to wait
787.64s:  and see how that pans out. So what does all this mean from a broad market? It's a weird one.
793.96s:  I still have my cues position on as I already said. Still trading zero DTEs, all that kind of
798.44s:  stuff standard programming there. But I think you kind of have to be careful here. This clearly
804.68s:  isn't looking like some sort of straight parabolic V-shape recovery back up to highs still could be.
811.64s:  But it doesn't necessarily look like that. And again, one of the things I would point to for that
816.12s:  specifically in the NASDAQ is that the majority of the volume today was by volume and it's still
821.80s:  closed down. So it tells me that the buyers aren't super strong here. And it does tell me that we're
826.36s:  starting to see enough larger size selling stepping in to push price at least a little bit.
834.12s:  And also that I've heard from the indices. I don't like seeing spy and cues moving quite so
840.36s:  differently. Not crazy to see small caps moving as they are just because they kind of been on a
846.92s:  different program for most of the year, but seeing the divergence between all of them makes me interested.
851.72s:  So right now I'm playing shorter term thesis. I'm playing earnings. I'm playing things like I
857.00s:  kind of talked about in the beginning of the video. Playing just shorter term velocity style movements.
862.44s:  Not so much drift right now. And it's because I'm waiting to see how things set up. All right,
868.20s:  let's take a quick look at GameStop. Gotta be honest, it's been quiet in here. It's been quiet in
872.60s:  GameStop. And today it is again. So if we take a look, it is just trending sideways. We've gone from
881.16s:  like 2154 to 2190 for like the last five days. We are just grinding sideways here.
889.48s:  From a volume perspective, we are still anemic. Volume is super, super low. We are still light
895.80s:  years away from the 20 day average, which is 8.3 million. Today's average was three today's not
902.52s:  average. Today's total volume was 3.46. So very light transactions going on in here. It does still
912.52s:  look like when I look at the options chain that the activity in the near term expiration is
921.08s:  is surprisingly as as spicy as it tends to be. So the 16 aug expiration is pretty built out here.
929.48s:  Now again, I'm trying to keep an eye on this 20 step expiration to see how the build out is going
934.52s:  there as we're getting closer and closer. And it's not that crazy. Neither is the build out in 23 aug
940.76s:  or 30 aug. So what that tells me is I'm actually not positive where people are going to reposition.
948.20s:  Once we come up at the end of this week. So we can see some of the volume for today. And we can
953.48s:  see some of this is moving out into 23 aug. That's what these are. And you can see a little bit. This
959.16s:  looks like moving out to 30 aug. That's what these are. So there's some rotation happening today.
965.56s:  But it's not a lot. 82,000 traded today on the call side versus 20,000 puts. So right now from
973.40s:  specifically game stop perspective, it kind of does look like we're in a bit of a holding pattern still.
978.60s:  I'm eager to see how things start getting busy around earnings. I'm still not seeing earnings
985.64s:  expiration cycle. IV is high as I would expect it. My guess is this will start to jack up more and
990.84s:  more as it gets a little bit closer. But it's not massively high. The other thing I want to look
995.08s:  at quickly is what is the expiration cycles look like coming up? So 16 aug there's 295,000 calls,
1002.20s:  100,000, 100, 6000 puts. 23 aug is 41,000 to 11,000. 30 aug is 37 to 10. 6 step. Wow, that's
1015.00s:  actually really surprising. It's 12 to 2. So just super quiet, super, super quiet. 13 step 48,
1023.88s:  100 to 2, 6, 100 and then 27, 49 to 27. So overall, the front expiration as per usual with
1032.12s:  game stop is the busy spot. But it does look like very quiet after this expiration cycle. So really
1038.44s:  what this means for me is I still have my shares. I'll just keep holding those. But when it comes
1044.52s:  to trading options or playing options, I'm selling calls against the shares because we're just trending
1049.56s:  sideways. And that helps support the position a bit. And there's still good IV in the product overall.
1056.84s:  So if we take a look at the out of the monies, we took a look at the vol, you can still see like
1063.16s:  there's really decent out of the money call volume or volatility. Sorry. So this is still heavily
1069.96s:  appealing to me from an option selling perspective to take something and get against the long shares
1075.72s:  because again, the long shares are just kind of grinding sideways. They're not really doing
1079.80s:  anything super fun to look at. So that is that as always, there's any questions. Let me know the
1086.76s:  outlier pros. We have a live stream later today. And then the GME live stream will be this coming
1092.36s:  Saturday Newton. We don't know if he's going to be there. He's starting to feel a little bit better,
1096.60s:  but it might be a lot, you know, depending on how he's feeling on the weekend. So we'll probably
1101.16s:  make a game time decision for him if he's able to join, but if not, we'll definitely reconnect soon
1106.04s:  enough. And we he and I have a lot to talk about. We've been texting a bunch just kind of throwing
1110.76s:  some ideas around that we both want to talk about. So looking forward, hope you still feel better,
1116.12s:  my dude. And then for everybody else, be an outlier. I'll see you guys later.
