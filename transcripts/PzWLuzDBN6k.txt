0.00s: What's up, outliers? Quick market update. We're going to talk a little bit about Siga and
4.90s: this new monkey box public health concern that's going on. We're going to talk a little bit
9.80s: about some upcoming earnings in stuff like Cisco, Baba. And that probably get us pretty
17.16s: good throughout the video today. So let's get straight and we'll talk about GameStop.
21.04s: My bad at the end, we will absolutely take a look at GameStop. Mostly just because
24.40s: I started a cadence on it. And once I start something, I just kind of keep dealing
29.28s: it. So that will be here as well. But let's start with Siga. If you'll notice, Siga is up
37.00s: 26.9% on the day, massive massive move. This popped up on a couple of my scans. And why did it
45.36s: pop up on some of my scans? What really has to do with this uptick in Mpox, so which is monkey
54.72s: Pox, by the way? So if you take a look, this came out earlier and it's essentially talking
60.72s: about what this whole monkey Pox thing is about. I'm going to read because I don't know exactly
66.52s: what it is. I have an idea, but I'll read to you exactly what it is. It's an infectious
70.76s: viral disease that can occur in humans and other animals. Symptoms includes rash that
76.56s: forms blisters, crusts over fever, swollen lymph nodes. It says the illness is usually
82.08s: mild. And most of the infected will recover within a few weeks without treatment. Symptoms
89.12s: include rash, fever, exhaustion, swollen lymph nodes, muscle aches, sore throat. And the
95.36s: medication is, okay, let's see how bad anti-virus. That's the easy one to say. The one that's
102.08s: not easy to say is teco-virumat. See, all right, that is. I don't feel super confident there.
108.64s: But essentially, it looks like chicken Pox, small Pox, much less infectious and it doesn't seem
114.88s: quite as deadly. Now, interestingly enough, though, if you take a look at the company's siga,
121.20s: it produces an anti-viral for it. So that's why it's flying up and off to the races today.
128.08s: This is one of the really cool things about markets is I just got to refresher in what monkey Pox is.
134.32s: I got to refresher on a company that is performing because of the new concern that's coming up.
140.56s: And it's all tradable events. So you can see this isn't new news, right? You can see that going
147.76s: back to the first that there's been some early conversations about it specifically on the fifth,
154.08s: the World Health Organization warns on a deadly or strain of monkey Pox. And you can kind of see
159.92s: that it's been building over time. The eighth, it shows plans to declare regional monkey Pox outbreak
166.64s: in emergency. And you can kind of see the way that the stock moves with this news. And then
172.72s: today, it was declared as a public health emergency. And a coordinated international response
180.08s: is essential to halt outbreak. So tradable events, these are tradable events to me. I always
186.16s: look for stuff like this because it's a catalyst. There's movement. It's super unfortunate. I don't
191.52s: want to see monkey Pox going crazy. I don't want to see people going through viral infections and
196.80s: having to endure that. That sucks. But there's a reality here from the market perspective. And
202.96s: this company builds a potential cure slash solution for it. And you can see that being reflected
210.24s: today, the volume was insane at 13 million volume where it's 20 day average volume is just
220.96s: what 1.2 million shares up and off up and off to the races. So this is something you could play
227.92s: a bunch of different ways for something like this. It looks like a lot of the move probably has
233.28s: happened. If you got into late, for me, when I first start looking, it's kind of when it breaks
237.52s: above this 10 handle, it looked really interesting. So that's when I started nibbling. And it's just
242.88s: because I was looking above recent resistance, at least as far as I could perceive it. This would be
247.60s: a much shorter term trade for me. And I'll just kind of follow it up. But that's really all there
253.20s: is to this one. It does have options, although they are grossly illiquid. They're not great. But they
259.60s: can get the job done. If you need some options in here, you can trade stuff like a ratio diagonal
265.68s: on the call side. That's what I did. And it's not very liquid, but there's enough to get the job
270.96s: done. That's one of the cool parts about being a poor retail trader is that you're small enough
276.40s: that you can make stuff like this works sometimes. So yeah, overall interesting breakout, I guess you
282.80s: could say, pun partially intended. And that is just one idea off of this, but I think it's something
290.88s: to keep an eye on. Now, specifically if the deadlier strain starts to take hold, that's really
296.08s: important because we just went through a global pandemic not too long ago. We know how that goes.
301.60s: So again, it doesn't seem so far like this is anything like that. I'm not here to try to fear
305.76s: longer. I'm just saying it's something I personally would watch, depending on how the deadlier variant
311.92s: emerges and what that looks like. In the meantime, you can just play the initial response here.
316.32s: And that's kind of the way that I look at it. So that is, say go, now we have to take a look at
322.32s: Cisco. And they just reported earnings and they came in at 87 cents against 77 cents estimate.
334.48s: So they topped expectations pretty well. And after the market here, they're running 48 bucks when
340.96s: it closed at 45. So this is just a standard earnings play for me. Nothing sexy in here. I did have
346.88s: a slight bullish skew just because I don't fear the downside in something like Cisco as much as I
352.48s: fear the upside because if for whatever reason, this thing decided to really start taking flight,
357.04s: it can get terribly painful. And I mean, based on where we close today, again, like the open
362.48s: tomorrow, if it stays around where it's at, that opens up here. So it's a pretty big gap up. But
367.92s: not terrible. Definitely overall manageable position here. Now the overall earnings though looked
376.32s: decent. I didn't get a chance to go through all of it, but we can take a look at some of it together here.
382.56s: And let's see. So product sales came in at 9.86 billion. And it looks like revenue came down just
393.04s: a little bit and it plans a workforce reduction of 7%. Typically, don't like to see that, but it's
398.48s: typically favorable for the following quarter, everything else remaining the same. It does help cut
403.60s: costs. So this isn't awfully surprising to see here because it is, I mean, if you look at the
410.72s: path of Cisco, it doesn't look as good as pretty much everything else that's been flying along with
417.60s: this broader tech headwind. A lot of things, especially in the AI space, have been flying off the
424.08s: charts here. So when Cisco kind of has this kind of chart configuration, it does cause some questions.
429.76s: I don't want to necessarily go as far as to say that it gives Intel vibes because this is a whole
434.88s: other story, which this is again, another really interesting trade that I like down here for a whole
439.20s: other thing. But Cisco looks like it needs to do something. So the fact that they're looking at
446.48s: cutting some workforce doesn't holistically surprise me much at all. So it says revenue for
452.48s: the quarter ending 27 July 13.64 billion, which is down from 15.2 billion year earlier. And they
461.28s: expected 13.54. So it came in a little bit better than expectations. And then it expects fiscal 2025
469.52s: non-gap EPS of 352 to 358. And revenue falling between 55 bill and 56.2 bill. And right now the
481.04s: expectation is 355 and 55.68 billion. So kind of like right in there. So yeah, that's that.
489.76s: All right, let's now take a quick look at Boba because Boba reports more morning.
497.12s: And it closed down 2% on the day after hours trading right around 80 so up about 50 cents.
504.88s: And this one I'm kind of eager to see this is not one I'm trading. And it's primarily because the
511.20s: last view that I saw, I mean, look at this. This is like just parabolic chop around the earnings.
516.40s: Look at all of these. It's just kind of madness. If you wanted to go long-vall, this wouldn't be
520.88s: a terrible spot to do it. I don't think. But long-vall isn't really like through earnings is not
527.44s: my typical go to. But this does have earnings coming up tomorrow before the open. So it'll be another
533.60s: one I'm taking a look at because Boba is kind of a good representation just of broader economy
539.68s: and specifically for China. So I'll use it just for a general proxy on like what they're seeing
545.44s: how things are going. So that is that for Boba. All right, now let's take a quick pivot to kind
551.84s: of the broader market. I really want to highlight one specific thing. We don't have to spend a bunch of
555.52s: time taking a look at this stuff. But let's grab our standard flexible grid here so we can see what's
561.44s: going on. And again, divergence. That's what I see. Russell rotating down down day. Q's slightly
572.48s: down. S and P500 up divergence. So what does this mean from a tradable scenario? To me, it's kind of
581.60s: like watching it unfold until it gets to a point that it starts to become even more appealing.
587.36s: And the appealing part would be something like short large cap long short long small cap. I was
594.08s: going to say short cap. I don't know why it doesn't really make sense. So but being short
599.92s: large cap long small cap. It's been a okay trade, but it's taken a long time to come in. That's
607.68s: why I'm being a little more cautious in terms of my timing. And I still have my long teachable
613.68s: cues position. So it wouldn't be like I'm overall gross short. The large caps it would just kind
619.12s: of be a small pair of straight specifically between something like IWM and spy. But the relationship
624.24s: between the two of them has been fairly defunct for a while now. So what this means for me is as
629.44s: I'm watching small caps. It's eyes on small caps. I want to see if it can start breaking above
635.04s: these levels here. And I just want to see if it can catch a bit. And if it can start just
641.92s: getting some sort of strength underway because I do still find it interesting that we have a
648.32s: rate cut that's still projected at 100% coming up and small caps are still just not playing ball here.
655.68s: I can't I can't help but find that interesting. The other thing I can't help but find interesting is
659.44s: the fact that the cell volume today was massive by volume was 7.8 million and the cell volume was
666.00s: 17.38 million. So that tells me that there's just a lot of repositioning happening by these larger
673.28s: funds in these really short term time frames which is kind of crazy. Typically you don't see it
677.84s: necessarily go down like that. So yeah, I mean that is part of what's going on here. Bons are still
683.76s: ticking up and up and up. So I see them at 124.13 here on ZB. So Broad Market is kind of in this weird
694.00s: spot starting to see more divergence is kind of the main call out here. Now the other thing I want
698.80s: to highlight is this. This is really interesting to me. So if I take a look at QQQ which is the NAS
707.52s: DAC at a tiny little bit of a down day today volume was mostly by volume 65% but then take a look
715.60s: at net highs lows. Net highs lows still negative trending right around negative 56s essentially
723.28s: unchanged over yesterday. It was like negative 59 yesterday negative 56 today. And
728.56s: the gross highs is growing and went from 80 to 101. Gross lows is also growing from negative 139
738.24s: to negative 157. This is not super common that you'll see this. So for me, this is the kind of thing
745.60s: that I will watch and see how net highs lows pans out specifically in the Q's before I start doing
752.80s: a whole lot because again, like this is an abnormal divergence in the indicator. And it's something
758.48s: that I would want to see how it resolves. Is it that the general pack of stocks is starting to
766.96s: uplift with just, you know, a smaller group of lingering stocks rotating under could be. But I
773.68s: also care about the change, right? So day over day, we added 21 highs and a little under 20 lows.
782.64s: So that is starting to capitulate towards the high side. So I have to wait and see how that pans out.
790.08s: So what does all this mean from a broad market? It's a weird one. I still have my Q's position on
795.68s: as I already said, still trading zero DTEs, all that kind of stuff standard programming there. But
801.68s: I think you kind of have to be careful here. This clearly isn't looking like some sort of straight
807.12s: parabolic V-shape recovery back up to highs still could be. But it doesn't necessarily look like
813.92s: that. And again, one of the things I would point to for that specifically in the NASDAQ is that
818.16s: the majority of the volume today was buy volume and it's still closed down. So it tells me that
823.52s: the buyers aren't super strong here. And it does tell me that we're starting to see enough larger size
829.20s: selling stepping in to push price at least a little bit. And also that divergence between the
835.84s: indices. I don't like seeing spy and cues moving quite so differently. Not crazy to see small caps
844.32s: moving as they are just because they kind of been on a different program for most of the year.
848.24s: But seeing the divergence between all of them makes me interested. So right now I'm playing
853.60s: shorter term thesis. I'm playing earnings. I'm playing things like I kind of talked about in
857.68s: the beginning of the video. Playing just shorter term velocity style movements. Not so much drift
864.00s: right now. And it's because I'm waiting to see how things set up. All right, let's take a quick
868.80s: look at GameStop. Gotta be honest, it's been quiet in here. It's been quiet in GameStop.
874.00s: And today it is again. So if we take a look, it is just trending sideways. We've gone from like 21,
881.92s: 54 to 2190 for like the last five days. We are just grinding sideways here. From a volume
890.16s: perspective, we are still anemic. Volume is super, super low. We are still light years away from
896.88s: the 20 day average, which is 8.3 million. Today's average was three. Today's not average. Today's
903.28s: total volume was 3.46. So very light transactions going on in here. It does still look like when I look
913.76s: at the options chain that the activity in the near term expiration is surprisingly as spicy as
924.16s: it tends to be. So the 16-Ogg expiration is pretty built out here. Now again, I'm trying to keep an
931.44s: eye on this 20-step expiration to see how the buildout is going there as we're getting closer and
936.24s: it's not that crazy. Neither is the buildout in 23-Ogg or 30-Ogg. So what that tells me is I'm
944.88s: actually not positive where people are going to reposition once we come up at the end of this week.
950.88s: So we can see some of the volume for today. And we can see some of this is moving out into 23-Ogg.
956.08s: Right, that's what these are. And you can see a little bit. This looks like moving out to 30-Ogg.
961.28s: That's what these are. So there's some rotation happening today. But it's not a lot. Right, 82,000
967.84s: traded today on the call side versus 20,000 puts. So right now from specifically GameStop perspective,
975.28s: it kind of does look like we're in a bit of a holding pattern still. I'm eager to see how things
981.20s: start getting busy around earnings. I'm still not seeing earnings expiration cycle. IV is
988.08s: high as I would expect it. My guess is this will start to jack up more and more as it gets a little
991.60s: bit closer. But it's not massively high. The other thing I want to look at quickly is what is the
996.08s: expiration cycles look like coming up? So 16-Ogg. There's 295,000 calls 100,000, 100,000,
1003.76s: 6,000 puts. 23-Ogg is 41,000 to 11,000. 30-Ogg is 37 to 10. Six-SEP. Wow, that's actually
1015.28s: really surprising. It's 12 to 2. So just super quiet. Super, super quiet. 13-SEP, 48-20-2,
1024.80s: 2600. And then 27-49 to 27. So overall, the front expiration as per usual with GameStop is the
1032.80s: busy spot. But it does look like very quiet after this expiration cycle. So really what this means for
1040.00s: is I still have my shares. I'll just keep holding those. But when it comes to trading options or
1045.60s: playing options, I'm selling calls against the shares because we're just trending sideways.
1050.56s: And that helps support the position a bit. And there's still good IV in the product overall.
1056.80s: So if we take a look at the out of the monies, we took a look at the vol. You can still see like
1063.28s: there's really decent out of the money call volume or volatility. Sorry. So this is still
1069.60s: heavily appealing to me from an option selling perspective to take something against the long shares.
1075.68s: Because again, the long shares are just kind of grinding sideways. They're not really doing
1079.84s: anything super fun to look at. So that is that. As always, there's any questions. Let me know the
1086.80s: outlier pros. We have a live stream later today. And then the GME live stream will be this coming
1092.32s: Saturday, Newton. We don't know if he's going to be there. He's starting to feel a little bit
1096.40s: better, but it might be a lot, you know, depending on how he's feeling on the weekend. So we'll probably make
1101.36s: a game time decision for him if he's able to join. But if not, we'll definitely reconnect soon enough.
1106.48s: And we he and I have a lot to talk about. We've been texting a bunch just kind of throwing some
1110.96s: ideas around that we both want to talk about. So looking forward, hope you still feel better.
1116.16s: My dude. And then for everybody else, be an outlier. I'll see you guys later.
