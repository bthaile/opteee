 you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you because there's absolutely nothing, nothing at all, that would hurt him from continuing to follow Ryan Cohen, right? Even if he didn't like him anymore, I'm just talking hypothetically. I have no idea. But even if he didn't like him anymore, if he didn't like GameStop, like if all of these things were true, he still loses nothing by just continuing to follow Cohen and leaving things as the status quo. So I don't think those other things are necessarily the case, by the way. But I'm using it to pose an argument. And the argument is he wouldn't have done this unless he wanted that message to be known because this is one of the ways he communicates. And it's really interesting. So I have no idea what the theories are related to this. But I definitely think it means something. Otherwise, again, you wouldn't do it. So I find that kind of curious. Where he says, maybe he's over GameStop, it's that kind of thing is so hard to say. It's like really, really hard to say because there is the fact that we know he moved not out necessarily. We don't know. We can't confirm that he moved out when he went into Chewie. But even the fact that it was Chewie is kind of telling, telling something because that's Cohen's company, right? So like there's still an attachment there in some way. And then there was the other post I remember you guys showed me where it was like the office. And it was like the GameStop shaking hands with the cat. So there's like that. Lauren says that theories he's going to be on the board, but not sure why he would unfollow RC because of that. Yeah, I don't think that would make any sense at all. I mean, that literally is just completely illogical. I also don't, I also don't really follow why, why people think he's going to try to like be on the board. I don't get that. Ron clady says, did you miss the part where he unpinned his original D2? No, no, no, I didn't. And I appreciate you bringing it up. Sorry to me to skip over. I'm just segmenting first before looking at things. When looking at something like this, like those those two things, I kind of look at them as individuals. And then I look at them as a composite to try to get a sense of what the breadth of evidence is saying so that I can try to have an idea of what what the motivations and what might be. But yeah, the board thing doesn't make literally any sense at all to me. So let's see what the, let's see what's up. Let the 10 begin. That's good. And okay. Okay. So then somebody highlighted this, the GameStop YouTube video. This is hilarious. I literally love, I love this. This is so funny. It's so funny. Okay. Let's see. I'm trying to figure out like what the actual theories are. Can look at the past, give us an indication last year he liked to tweet a few days before starting to tweet again this year. Likes are no longer visible. So we took another action that he knew would be visible to some keynide people yet far less visible than a tweet. But like, what's the point of that? Right? He 100,000 trading algos with direct API access to his tweet. So with this action, he could just be announcing his impending return to a certain group of highly regarded and that's fascinating. I mean, I don't understand why because when we're talking about the algos that might be watching his movements, if he makes the tweet on a weekend, the movement in the stock is already muted, no matter what. So it would probably trade pretty haywire following the open, you know, whenever the next open is. But I don't see the motive behind why he would execute that way. I don't see RK unfollowing RC is having any basis in arcade no longer agreeing with the direction that RC is taking the company. I think it's a lot more likely that he knew we'd notice it. It may not have happened. Had he unfollowed a different rando and is, I just don't know, man. Yeah, I don't agree with this just because it doesn't really logically make sense. If the goal is to try to like come back without coming back, he could post a million different things or he could make a comment on a million different things that don't necessarily directly link back to GameStop. So and even that, I'm not sure what the overarching motive would be to try to make a post without being linked to games. Like I just don't get all that. So I don't I don't fully follow. But again, like I don't have a good counter theory. So I'm not attempting to take these down and deconstruct them. I don't have a good argument to post back because it just doesn't make sense to me. So right now what I'm doing is just trying to see what what it could be, right? Like what logically might this be? Have all eyes on the page for what's the calm. See, like this is the thing though, is that like if he just posts whatever is to come, the the attention's already there. So I agree with this part though on the idea of building some sort of hype. And I also think that he is a troll. I think he has fun playing games. And again, I always go back to that video of Ryan Cohen and people in that interview where they were talking about like the things he was holding, the games that what order the games were in the background and Ryan Cohen was just like no dog. It's literally just a picture. But everybody's like reading in so far. Now the weird part about it though that I do find interesting is that I imagine he has to feel some level of like a social contract with when he communicates and the impact it has on a lot of people. I know I would and I imagine he's a pretty thoughtful dude. And what I mean by this is there are so many people who their entire investment lives revolve around GameStop that like any monochrome of evidence that the cat is around the cat is doing something has an effect on those kinds of people. So I'm not convinced that he would be interested in like teasing them because honestly, it's kind of fucked up. And I wouldn't I wouldn't do that. And I imagine he probably wouldn't want to do that either. So that's why I think that there's probably some other message or some other thing. He's coily conveying but it's essentially impossible to tell as per usual, right? Because that's one of the interesting things about the modality of communication is that and that's why you that's that's why we know he likes to troll because you can make cryptic communication that's still decipherable. A lot of the things that he does, they're so cryptic that literally armies of people trying to figure out what it is, can't figure out what it is. That's not communication. That's not what communication is. And even if you wanted to make it difficult to get to the message, a great example of this is the emoji timeline. I cannot tell you how many theories I've seen on the emoji timeline and how many I haven't seen one that's actually panned out. So that to me would tell me that there's not inherently the super intricate meaning for each emoji in the emoji timeline. And why? Because I do think that there's an element of him that he enjoys just playing around having fun. But I am curious how he balances that with the impact he knows he has on people because it's perfect example. This is one subreddit he did two things and this thing is 6,000 likes and 721 comments over the course of two days. That's incredible engagement again in one vacuum. So he absolutely knows this impact and it's super, super interesting to think about from like a game theory perspective, you know what the overall idea was. So let's see. If you were done with GameStop, he would just be done, fade out, not sent out any type of signals, buckle up. That could be. He's not following because he intends to lead, funny. Yeah, I don't see anything. There's nothing in here that strikes me as like, oh yeah, this makes sense. Now this was two days ago when he did this or is this two days ago when we found out? I imagine we would have found out pretty close. So if we take a look at 24th to the 22nd, I mean, that's hard to the timing of that is impeccable. Yeah, with the move. But the timing of it aside, this move had already started. So that might have been a little bit of fuel to the fire or something, but really, really interesting. Ryan says, I think he's just sitting back and messing around, enjoying folks try to analyze his changes. I definitely think that yeah, I agree with that. I think that that's a part of it. I really do think he enjoys trolling a little bit. He has fun. And we can see that reflected in a few different ways. And Cohen also does the same thing. Now again, I do think the unfollowing thing is like, that's a pretty universal symbol, right? If I unfollow somebody, it's it's generally because like I'm not interested in what they're doing. And that doesn't mean inherently that like, I don't like them or I hate them or anything like that. But for me specifically, I curate my feeds super super carefully because there's so much bullshit on social media. So that's how I make sure that like I'm getting decent stuff that I want to look at. But in this context, I'm not convinced that that fully fully applies here. So yeah. Lauren says, do you know why unfollow people because I don't care for them anymore? See, yeah, I totally get that. You could be temporarily out of GME like potentially did with Chewy, maybe sold to raise capital for something else. That could be. Yeah, that kind of thing could be. I think the we would see it though. Right. So if we just take a look at what his last position was before leaving, there would absolutely be artifacts of him exiting. And I mean, at least as of late, we don't necessarily see that. But it could be depending on like even he might not have exited most recently, right? He could have exited at any point. We have no idea because it's been a while. So absolutely could be. But I would imagine that if it was some sort of precipitous exit, we would have seen some signs, which I don't think we picked up on. Uh, Sneal says RC and followed Bitcoin RK RK and followed hold on RC unfollowed BTC Bitcoin Roryn Kitty unfollowed Cohen. I don't actually get that. When did Cohen unfollow Bitcoin? I don't know when Cohen unfollowed Bitcoin was at the same day because that would be kind of interesting. April 22nd, so like a month ago. Interesting. Okay. A mashing says the tin I here is RK unfollowed RC because he's no longer following him in share count as he passed RC. I find it hard to believe he would have that many shares. Yeah. I mean, I don't really buy it because we would have to see filings if he did. Like if he accumulated more, there would still be additional filings for the share side of the equation, which we haven't seen. So yeah, I don't think it's that. Who knows? As always, the cat does what the cat wants and everybody's just kind of like sat trying to look at it and see if there's anything we can piece out of it. But to that end, what I want to do is poke through. We'll take a look. I think the two main names that people wanted to take a look at were hymns and so-fi. So we'll take a look at those. And then we'll take a look at GameStop. I'll give you an update on the GameStop Covered Strangle that I have on. We'll take a look at the options and everything. Now, if you're one of the people that asked me to look at hymns or so-fi, if you have any any additional context on just, if it's just a general thing that you want to look at, if you have a specific question about something, let me know. But boring that, I'm just going to poke through them broadly really fast. So we'll start with hymns. And this one was really interesting to me simply because of the movement, right? The overall fact pattern that we see here. We can see that it literally rallied 200% over the course of like a month. And then from that 200% rally, it crashed 68% and from that 68% crash, it rallied 175%. Crazy. Like absolutely crazy moves. Now, the interesting thing here though is it's almost slightly cyclical. And if we're looking at the price behavior, I mean, it had the parabolic rise into the earnings release, earnings release punished it. And then it fell down essentially to the prior consolidation levels before that, which is super interesting. And then it had a good earnings. And then now we obviously sit where we sit. So let's take a quick look at the options chain and see what we can learn from here. And I imagine we'll see a few things. I imagine that we'll see pretty defiant. Okay, I'm wrong right out of the gate. Perfect start. I was going to say that I expected to see bigger skew. I didn't have an opinion on call versus put, but I thought it would be a bigger difference between them specifically because when things make these kinds of parabolic moves most frequently, there is a defined expectation of follow on price movement of some sort, which we're just not necessarily seeing just yet. So that's interesting. Now, if we break this out into the various expiration cycles, run expiration is leaning short, which makes complete sense to me after the move and after the roll over that we're starting to see. And then six June bullish skew ever so slightly, 13 June bearish skew, 20 June heavy bearish skew. So there's actually pretty decent in terms of OI. And as everybody that follows the channel knows, OI only tells part of the story. It tells us what's most active, but it doesn't tell us where the money is. So as grand possible in skis to say money talks bullshit walks. So now we got to figure out where the money is because that will tell us a lot in terms of how the market is expecting the moves. So we'll take a look at a couple charts. Let's sort this by premium. Huge huge huge huge put premium skew over the calls. Huge. That's 6.8 million in puts against 3.6 million on calls. That is bearish skew. And then we can see bullish skew for the 30th. That's fascinating because think of this. I was just showing you this expiration cycle in terms of OI. Look at this way more puts. But then if we look at the actual amount of premium in those puts, it's not that much. What that tells us is those are people buying further out of the or trading, I should say we don't know inherently no buying, but trading further out of the money puts, which is generally more directional actually in terms of expectation as compared to something that's at the money or in the money. But the reason why we know that is because of the price. If open interest is really high, but total premium is low, that means that we're getting stuff that's pretty far out of the money. So that's pretty curious. Let's take a look at the next primary expiration. It looks like call side. So it looks like from a premium lens, this is still like pretty bullishly set up, which I'm not sure that I would necessarily have my bingo card because this is still absolutely downwards loping. But and we didn't really post a higher low until now. So if it consolidates here, I mean, this can actually be a pretty healthy launch point. So what I'm going to do is set a couple alerts just at a curiosity and see if it starts breaking above. And then the last thing I want to do is just look at all. And then we'll move on to the next. Let's take a look at the vol curve specifically. This will be the volatility surface. But we'll do the out of the monies. And then let's do the primary explorations. Yeah. I mean, standard. This is different in terms of what you typically see in meme stocks. A lot of times in meme stocks is you guys know full well by now. You guys have seen this. That's one of the cool things, by the way, for anybody that's followed along for even a decent number of the episodes we've done for these Saturday series is episode 41 is you've seen things multiple times at this point and are actually subconsciously learning, even if sometimes consciously it might escape you. And being able to look at a volatility surface and use that to come up with an analysis of where you think something might go is an incredible skill. And it's because options are really, really informed traits. They're leveraged. And you don't seek leverage in size unless you have a pretty good idea of what you think might happen. So the fact that you're able to look at this and follow along with me is awesome. And if you're not, that's totally cool. Again, there are people that probably the first time they saw anything like this will have absolutely no idea what this was. But I'm sure people in the chat will tell you that over time as you look at it more and more, it really does start to make sense. And that's one of the coolest things about options is they give you a probabilistic lens to view the world as compared to just guessing, which is pretty sick. Okay. So anyways, all that aside, we can see that the tails are big on the out of the money puts. So this typically is favoring a higher probability of a larger, I'm sorry, of a smaller of a larger total downside move, lower probability. Let me rephrase that because I lost myself in the middle. I don't want to confuse you. When you see the tail this high, it means that there's a higher probability of a larger move, but a lower probability that the move itself will actually happen. And then when you see wall to the upside muted like this, that's a higher probability of a smaller move. That's what this is telling us. So you can see that it's absolutely favoring a higher probability of a smaller upside move, but we're seeing normal skew. So this is kind of standard fair. But super interesting to me, at least hopefully interesting to you as well. Okay. If there's any follow on questions for him, let me know. Otherwise, we will move on to the next in our list. But before we do that, there is a small creature scratching at my door post dinner. And if you know who it is, you know who it is. One second. All right. The man, the myth, the legend, he's ready to rock and roll. You can see, check him out. He does have his tuxedo on. That's wrong way. See? Does have his tuxedo. He's dressed. What are you doing? I think he's good. I feel like he's doing eye. So he is rip roaring to get back into now. Still fine. Let's take a look at so fine. Okay. So fine. Completely different story. Completely different story. It's last earnings it beat. It looks like it didn't. It looks like it didn't have, like really accommodating move. And definitely a defined downtrend. Now it is starting to reverse the like the broader trend. We can see that here. It's always the basics higher high. Then we can see that that term high swings. So then you see lower high. And then you see lower low from here. And then you see lower high from here. Then you see lower low from here. This is the absolute standard for analyzing a trend. So then we have the swing low. And it's starting to rally. So you can see a higher local high than here. A higher local low than here and here. So this is the kind of thing that's in the middle. I would call so we'll be able to take a look at a few things here. To get a better sense of what's going on. And then we'll pivot over to to game stop because we actually have a lot to go over there. And I want to make sure that we have plenty of time. But let's take a look at the options chain. Lauren says side eye on point. That's right. That's Thor is the literally the the expert of the side eye. Raphael says, Hey, everybody I'm new here. Welcome in. Raphael. That's a sick name. I'm pretty sure that's one of the teenage mutant interturdles. If I'm not mistaken. Is that correct? I know there's like Michael, Michael, Donna, Donna, Tello, Michael, Angelo. I feel like Raphael is one. I remember splinter splinter is sick. It is. Yeah, okay, great. Maybe that's what you're named after. Now one of the things that's super interesting here is take a look at the call skew here. 1.8 mil against 1.1 mil. Again, as always, when you look at open interest, open interest gives you just a piece of the puzzle. We can see the interest in potentially things like units. So when we're analyzing options chains and options flows, it's really important to understand the difference between these hot nitrogen says Raphael had that three pronged pointy weapon thing. Oh, the, um, oh, I know exactly what you're talking about. Raphael Ninja Turtle. Yeah. Yeah. Doesn't say what is look at this species mutant turtle. His home is the New York sewers. I love this. This is so funny. That's so funny. Okay, but what's, what's that thing called? I don't. What are those fucking things called? Anybody know? Raphael Ninja Turtle weapon. Size. That's it. There we go. Some sweet size. I feel like the size is just kind of a silly thing. It's just like a big fork that doesn't have enough prongs. I'd be pretty pissed off with that. Okay, back to what I was just talking about. I want to show you an important difference. And this will be a good learning point very quickly about options. So if actually, let me open the options. Okay. So these are the puts. These are out of the money. These are in the money. Further in the money equals higher delta. Further out of the money is lower delta. We don't, we won't worry about gamma. The first question, anybody that knows in the chat tell me is which one of these per lot per one lot cost more money in the money or out of the money. Which one of them? Because this part matters. And it'll make sense in the money. Perfect. So Snehe Hill, CW, Rubega, perfect. Good job, guys. Same thing with aquafrost. All correct. In the money, these are more expensive. Now we know that the in the money options are more expensive. So then why would I buy in the money options if I know they're more expensive? The first thing to consider is which one of these makes money on a smaller move out of the money or in the money? What's your guess? So say that we're looking at so far and say that we're expecting a two point move. Which one of these would make more money on a two point move? The out of the monies or the in the monies? Raphael says out of the money. Aquafrost says out of the money. Rubega says in the money. Cdubs says in the money due to delta. This is perfect. I'm glad that it split. Lauren off the top rope with the fucking authoritative in the money. Lauren, you got it. It's in the money. In the money is make more money. So let's just let's just do the math really fast. Let's say that you grab one of these and let's say that you grab one of these and we compare. So the 16 calls actually I'll do it in Excel really quick. I think this is a really, really good skill for you to be able to do on your own to make the comparison. So let me grab our handy dandy workbook that always turns into a massive mess after a few moments. But this is perfect. You get rid of all this and this will be super easy. So we need our strike price. We need the delta. We need the gamma. We need the current premium. And then what we'll do is we'll calculate P and L. We'll calculate value and P and L. So we have two strikes that we're looking at. We're looking at the 10 strike in the 16 strike. We're looking at in 11 delta. And we're looking at an 80 delta. I'm going to add a spot price input. Spot right now is 1309. Sick. So now let's take a look at what our gamma is gamma here is .06. And then on these your gamma is .1. So premium on these is 20 cents. We'll call it. We'll just use the bids. And then these are 310. Okay. So here's the beginning value of your option. And we're just going to do a one lot per. So we have just your premium times 100. That gives you the current value. Now let's say that spot changes. And let's say that spot changes by two bucks. What's happened now? Well, the first thing is we're now looking at 1509 for the underlying. Here's the important stuff, though. What's happened to your delta? In this case, your delta first provides a base move, which is the current delta. However, it's also going to gain the gamma here. And it's going to do that over the course of two points. You got a two point move. So your delta is going to move significantly. Now this isn't a direct comparison. By the way, I'm just giving you the overall scale and scope of how these things will move. Your delta here will also change. But remember, delta can only cap at one. So this isn't actually what your delta is going to be also because I have this as 80. This should be .8. So your delta essentially would max out. You get your delta of one. So now if we take a look at the P and L of these options, it's really, really simple. Because if you take a look at the current value and the current premium, your premium would change by your delta. So in this case, with a really small move, you can clearly see that this option would not provide you as much of a P and L change as this option. So going all the way back as to why this matters. Well, as we're analyzing the options change for things, we actually care a lot about the split between open interest and premium. Because if you have really high out of the money, open interest, it can mean different things. But one of the things is if it's out of the money, you might be expecting a more severe move because going back to this example, we know that the in the money is more expensive. So what does that mean? Let's say that you wanted to buy $5,000 worth. Which one of these can you buy more with the $5,000? Well, it's really simple. We're literally going to take our total bank roll and we're going to divide it by the premium. And you can figure out how many you can purchase. So in this case, it would just be your premium times 100 or you could use the other the value column that I made or you could just delete everything because you've fat-fingered it. That's another choice. Always another choice. But you take your $5,000, you divide it by the current value. And this is not a dollar. This is just the number of lots that you can get. The reason why this matters is because you can get way more units for the cheaper out of the monies for the same value. So the other thing is you can actually decrease the total investment if you're so inclined because you can get a pretty big position using less money. Now again, what's the trade-off? As always, with options, there's a trade-off. The big trade-off here is that you need a bigger move in order to make the money. And relative to how much premium is left in the options, your theta decay is absolutely going to chew you away unless you get the move quickly. That's what's going to happen. So anyways, back to this example. When I'm analyzing the difference between these, oh, I is part of this. The next component, as you saw before, is we want to look at what the actual premiums look like. Because that tells us our markets buying units or our markets actually just generally speculating on a direction. So like this here, we can see that there's fewer total puts on the next expiration cycle, but the premiums are about the same. So that tells us a few things. We can take a look at the OI and then we can see what kind of positions are being put on. So we can see that the OI is not quite double, but maybe 50% ish greater for the call side than the put side, but the premiums are actually kind of close, 776 against 653. So we can tell that we're getting cheaper calls and we're getting more of them than the puts. So the other thing that I care a lot about is what is the what is the order flow show me? And what I'm looking for is is there some sort of programmatic build out? Or are we seeing these are, oh, I changes is perfect. So what I want to know is are options being built? Or are we seeing options being taken down and which ones and in what ratios? Because again, we can infer a lot of information based on this and you can see that it's actually like kind of fair play between both of them. There's a really very, very slight call skew in terms of OI, especially as you go further out in time. This is common for companies that you expect to grow. So clearly, the longer term option holders in SoFi are expecting it to grow. And again, we can get a sense of well, to what degree, right? Again, money talks, bullshit walks. So we can figure out how far out we need to go in terms of the explorations. I don't know how many of this will let us do. This is great. So we can go effectively all the way out and take a look at this. 1.1 million in calls against 102,000 puts. What does that tell you? Upside expectation long term. What do we see here? 2026 June. Huge call premium skew. Same thing here in March. Same thing here in Feb. Same thing here, even in 2026. It's in January. It's not exactly to the same degree that you saw down there, but it's still double. So what I'm showing you is that the markets and the positioning you see is absolutely expecting upside price activity over the long run. But in the near term, you can clearly see that there are pockets of downside expectations like this here. This is a very clear pocket of downside expectation. So again, this is how we can use options to infer a few different things. So anyways, that effectively is what I'm seeing here now in terms of vol, vol is actually kind of light in so far, which is curious. And it definitely seems to be favored to the downside. For me, there's two levels that matter a lot to the upside. This is the first one. This is the second one. And the reason why these levels matters because I want, and again, that's not like the specific price levels just to be very clear for anybody that's not familiar with how I tend to do these. I care about this. How does it behave in this volume node? That matters a lot to me. And same thing here, we're in a volume node literally right now. So how does it behave in this volume node? And the reason why these matter is because it tells us our holders looking to accumulate more, or are they looking to unwind? Because right now we can absolutely see a clear trend of unwind. So it looks like near term, slightly favored to the downside. But again, as always, it's just one piece of new information or news that comes out that changes that. That's why as a trader, you have to be really quick on your feet to adapt to markets. And it's because you have to apply Bayesian analysis. Okay, cool. So that's so fine. Now we will move on to GameStop. We have a lot to talk about here. I'm going to go grab a seltzer water super fast. I'll be right back. And then we will get right into it. If there's any questions that you have on what we just talked about or to either of the prior tickers, please throw it in the chat. And then if there's any specific stuff you want to talk about relative to GameStop, also please throw that in the chat. VRB. All right. So guys, that didn'tmeal Paul Was will be in session with Transit 4 a photoshoot now? Yeah, that didn't. We back at it. Let's take a look at the latest in GameStop. The biggest thing by far is the last couple days, like by far. Now it is coming up not all two in the distant future on its next earnings release. Let's take a look at the price activity broadly. Roaring says, could we look at the options transactions between March 20th and now to see if there's anything at all that might be RK? I've looked at them already. I haven't seen anything, but we can definitely take a look again together if you'd like. But yeah, there really isn't much that I'm seeing. Rafael says, I don't have any questions, but I'd like to thank you. This is amazing. You're doing congrats. You guys meet here every Saturday. Yeah, that's exactly correct. So sometimes it's a live stream. Sometimes it's a video. I try to do these on live streams just because I know a lot of people enjoy looking at this together. And I enjoy spending the time with you guys looking at it. But yeah, we've been doing this for this is literally the 41st episode most weekends. A couple miss, but yeah, this is like pretty much every weekend. Seedup says, is it possible to determine how much bearish resistance exists at 34, 35 on GameStop? Yeah, we can take a look at that. You can't really determine, quote-unquote, how much is like bearish resistance? But we can take a look at what the total overhead resistance might look like. It's not crazy to me, which doesn't like that's what I would expect to see simply because it hasn't traded up there that much, right? So the volume node is pretty light. So what I'm doing here is I'm getting an idea of how many people transacted at these levels. When I'm using the volume profile, what I'm essentially saying is at what price points are people willing to transact? And I also am curious how many people are holding bags that might be incentivized to get out. So for example, like here, like this is still volume up here at the 55 handle. This is people that transacted at the bought at 55. So when price gets up to these levels, typically speaking, you will see people like this that are like, oh, shit, I'm just happy to get the fuck out of this thing because I've been holding it since it hit 55 and it hasn't been back there. But you can see how light that volume is. So what that means is as those people are happy to relieve their bags and try to cover at least for a small loss or break even or whatever they choose, if there's a lot of volume that provides a lot of selling pressure. Again, if a specific number of them choose to unwind there. So there's a couple factors that go into that in my brain, which is how far is the volume node off of spot price and for how long? If it's been there for a really long time where people have been hanging out super, super far away, then I tend to find that they're a little more eager to sell when price eventually navigates to those levels. So from a just volume node perspective, there really isn't much volume at the 34-35 handle. And we haven't even traded at the 35 handle until the squeeze in May and June. So that doesn't look super significant to me. Now, the other thing that we can look at is as always, we can look at the options chain and we can get a sense at the 35 handle what kind of positions exist, whether to maybe add a little bit of steam or to potentially hurt upward movement. And that'll be based more so on the hedging activity. None of these are what I want. What do I want? No. Did this one? This is not what I want. Oh, I know what I want. My bad. My bad guys. I know what I want. This one. So the 35 handle is mostly calls, like 46,800 calls, like actually pretty significant calls. So that provides bullish pressure, at least from a market maker hedging lens. So we can kind of see that at the 35 handle, but it's broadly, it's light. There's just not a ton. In terms of rapidly being built out, in terms of what sits there, it's still relatively light. You're going to see more of it at like the 20s, 25s. So the short answer to all of that is it doesn't look like a ton. There's not a lot of overhead transactions that have occurred there. So I wouldn't necessarily think that there's a lot of existing overhead pressure. So then the next question becomes when do people decide to start unwinding their shares? And it's not, it, the kinds of people referring to are larger holders. So let's ask Grock really quick. Can you break down the current holders of GameStop stock institutions versus retail and break down by institution? The reason why institution matters is because they are not inherently waiting for a squeeze. Some of them will, by the way. There are some institutions that absolutely will try to trade for squeezes. However, that doesn't really represent the larger bucket. So let's see. Institutional owner retail investors are like 60 and a half percent right now equating to 258 million shares. 75.4 million shares 25% are DRS. Ex-post estimate retail ownership at 52 million shares after accounting for institutional insider. Institutional ownership is at 31 to 34%. So 132 to 144 insiders is 8.5 to 22. Okay. So Van Gard right now has 33.6 mil shares at 1.04 billion. And it looks like they're the largest holder from an institutional lens. So what I'm looking for is evidence of, a machine says you're not looking at GM. No, I am sorry. I was in looking at another another page. I was reading off of Grock. I wasn't looking. Oh, this is, oh, for the 35 handle. That's my bad. My bad, my bad. Ah, decent at the 35. Definitely decent at the 35. But that's also because it's at 33. That makes way more sense now. I was wondering why the 35 would have been so like so super, super close. But anyways, back to the institutional accumulation and whatnot. That part matters to me quite a lot because we can get a sense of what kind of trading activity might we see at different points. So if we look at institutional transactions, let's see. We're going to look at the last two years. I mean, definitely net gain. And you can see the price is about 31. So it looks like they're generally interested in it at like the 30 handle and it does look like it's expanding. So yeah, I mean, to me, it looks like the 35 handle is, I mean, very much breachable. So if we take a look at just a probability cone. And let's take a look at the probability of being in the money specifically. And let's take a look at the 35 handle. And let's take a look over the next month primary expiration. I mean, there's right now a 37% chance of expiring effectively above the 35 handle. And one standard deviation move would put us at like the 44 handle. So yeah, I don't necessarily think the 35 handle looks like too much from an overhead lens. To me, it's likely more a factor of if people start unwinding to book profits there. I think something like that. All right, let's see. I know there's a couple more questions. I got to open door for three. Okay, now we have a post dinner, Thor. I Dase Wags says I'd like to discuss how covered call traders got ran over by the 30 call wall this past week and rolling up and out in general volume. Yeah, we could definitely take a look at them. They're they're really not going to be in a bad spot. And it's because they're going to be able to roll them like it's not going to be that that challenging. So if I take a look, I still think I might be in all options in GameStop if I'm not mistaken. Yeah, I'm still all options in GameStop. Let's take a look at. Let's take a look. So if we eyeball, I want to do I think on demand won't let us look at Friday. We can look at Thursday though. That's close enough. What I want to do is look at the option chain on Thursday so that we can see if somebody had 30 calls on the 23rd, what they could do with them because they absolutely it's only three points in the money 10% on GameStop with something that volatile and especially with typical call skew, they'll be able to roll them out in up no problem. For sure. So I'll show you what that looks like. And while that things load up, we'll get a little we'll get a little tracker built. We don't need all the options and stuff. So this will be spot price at entry, spot price to and then we'll have a strike, we'll have a delta, we will have X-spree, we will have premium, I mean, that's pretty much all we need here. And then let's do, we'll do lot size. So then we'll do value and then we'll do P and L. So this is premium to open. These will be for short calls and this will be close premium and that's how we'll calculate our P and L. Cool. So let's start with taking a look at what these traders might be holding. I'm just going to move this over and fill it in for now. So the spot price that they might have entered for the shares, let's just guess and we'll guess 25, 25. And the reason why I'm guessing 25, 25 is literally just because that's where that one of the larger volume nodes exists beyond this 27 handle. So guessing something like that. And their entry time would have been, let's say that they got in back here. So like well, Feb. And let's take a look at what those 30 calls are looking like. So the 23 May and let's say we'll just do a one lot for now because it doesn't matter. The strike will be the 30s delta. Right now is a 44 delta. We'll be able to ballpark some stuff in a second. The 40 trading for like 46. So let's just take a look regardless of like what their P and L would be all that stuff at a time. Let's just take a look at what we could roll these two because that's ultimately what matters. So if we choose to go out, let's say 29 days and we choose to go out to the 20 June and we're going to stick with our one lot. We know that we need to get at least 46 cents. So we're starting at the 30. Where can we get 46 cents? We literally can get it all everywhere, right? So this is if you made the adjustment on Thursday. Now we know GameStop traded higher on Friday. So what we can do is we essentially can make a surrogate guess and GameStop, what did GameStop close on Friday? You guys would probably know what like 33 something like that. So these like this option would essentially look like the 27s. So these would be trading for 283. 3303. Thank you. Captain Bob. Super helpful. So our option really would be trading for like 283. And the Delta would look something like a 91 Delta. Quick question. Does what I just did make sense? I'm just using a surrogate option to see what our option would generally look like given a different price point. That's all that is. Okay. Cool. It looks like C. Dub is on the same page and as long as C. Dub is on the page, then we on the page. Okay. So now let's go out to the 20 June. And let's see where we can get $2.83. We can get it at the 30 for sure. And if we wanted to try to roll up, you would only get $2.33.262. So you wouldn't get a ton. Now as you might remember, when you're rolling an option, you don't just have to make more than this number because you collected a credit on top of this, right? At some point in the future or at some point in the past. So your credit might have been like a dollar or something. I have no idea. We're just guessing. So what that means is on this trade itself, you're really only losing a $1.83 versus 283. So the value of this trade is that times your lot size times 100. And then your P&L on the trade is your opening premium, less your closing. This is for the calls times lot size times 100. So you lose an 183 bucks. So then if we want to change this and we want to get to a different strike, we really only need to make this amount of money. This is on a per-lot basis. We need to get a $1.83. That's where we would actually hit break even. So where's that $1.83? We can get a $1.83 all the way out to like the 33 and a half something like this. So the point that I'm making is for the traders that had the 30 strike, they're completely fine. And it's because there's a ton of choices with respect to management here. There in no way like caught, stuck, unable to adjust or move, that is just not the case at all for them. They're completely fine. So the cool part about something like GameStop is because of how volatile it is, it really does give you a ton of management choices that otherwise isn't always available. Which really it's a superpower because it's very frequent where that's not inherently the case. And it makes managing the trade so much more challenging. So yeah, I mean they're completely fine. Okay, let's see, let's see, let's see. CEDUB says is that the VRP? That's what it's called, right? I don't remember what we're looking at. Sorry. But VRP, Variant Source Premium is just the difference between implied and realized volatility. That's all. Volume is ramping though. It usually means something's about to happen, right? So Rudebega is actually following something I talk a lot about. And it's actually really, really important because there are a million different cycle theories. There's a million different timing theories. There's just a ton of different theories around GameStop's price behavior. Now the cool part is, as I will always continue to point out to you all, you can literally always, always identify points to pay attention when you see volume start to meaningfully expand. Before every significant price move GameStop has ever made, it has had a preceding expansion in volume like you're seeing right now. That should not be misconstrued to there's significant volume change, meaning price will go up or that there is absolutely going to be some sort of big price change. That is not what that means at all. What it does mean is that we absolutely have always seen some sort of change in volume before we get the price moves, the bigger price moves. And you can literally see that starting here. So this is the kind of timing where I like to pay attention because we had volume go from 8.76 to 21. That's a big, big change in volume. So does again, does this inherently mean that price is going to rip from here? Not inherently, but it does mean I mean, price has already started to rip if you look at it. I mean, this is 16% in two days to giant move. But does that mean it continues aggressively? That will highly depend on volume. So the point raised earlier is a really important point to make because now is the absolute time to pay attention. Now, this is a really dangerous time as well because there will be people that start to feel some type of way about missing the boat, quote unquote, and concerned about not being able to get at a good price. The difficulty there is that if you look at the frequency of game stop trading up at these levels, it's not very frequent. So that doesn't mean that it's going to go up into the mid 30s and then plummet. But it does mean that like if I were looking to build a position, it doesn't mean that you can't start looking to build a position now. It's like completely, completely fine. But I absolutely would not be coming in at size. So what that means is striking that same balance that I talked to you a lot about with respect to utilization and allocation. So if I had $5,000, $10,000, whatever your bankroll is allocated to the game stop position, I wouldn't use all of that to get in here. Now, again, there's a big difference between how I trade and how other people trade. This is, I move in between names and it's really important for me to be able to do that because it's how I capture opportunities. I fully understand that a lot of other people really just like game stop and a lot of people really just trade game stop, which is again, that's totally fine. The main reason I give you that context though is that there is a difference in approach and that's why the way I'm attacking this is different than most people I think. So yeah, the volume absolutely something to pay attention to because especially the type of candles that you're seeing, I'm not huge into candles stick analysis, but I do believe in using it as an observation point. And one of the things that does matter is when you see these big giant one-sided candles, they do tend to follow suit in the same direction to at least some degree until it reverses. We never know when. But the reason why that's the case is because it shows a very defined buying behavior. And people clearly are really, really interested at these levels. Now one of the concerns I would have is with the cat doing that seemingly aligned on this timeline. Meaning the last two days, that becomes a little problematic because we don't know if there's a degree of this that's effectively being propped up by algos. However, to refute that point, we've seen previously when the algos have gotten involved with his tweets, it's really short-lived. They move fast. So this is persistent behavior. This isn't just algos coming in and out. There's absolutely a persistent behavior here. Now it does have options coming up on the sixth. Options. It does have earnings coming up on the sixth. So we'll have to see how it performs around there. But starting to get like big long here, coming into earnings is a little bit tenuous. Now what we can do is analyze the options chain that includes that earnings release and see if there's informed money in there. And people that might be taking a strong speculative directional bet because there will be likely some of that. So the way we do that is by popping over and seeing what the options chain looks like. Hot Nitrogen says playing earnings is always scary. It shouldn't be scary. The only reason why it would be scary is if you're trading sizes that make you uncomfortable and that's bad news. So earnings we said is on the sixth of June. Is that correct? 6th of June. Is it confirmed yet or are they playing the game? Let's see what the ball looks like. 20 June looks a little high. 20 June looks a little high relative to the expiration cycle that includes earnings supposedly right now. Because I see it on the platform flagged is the sixth. I would expect to see. Ball around the sixth higher really just in this expiration cycle. So the fact that ball is higher out here, 130 and 3 quarters in 20 June leads me to believe that there is a chance that the market might think that the release might be after that. Because otherwise I would expect this ball to be higher relative to this ball. So TBD on when earnings actually will land. But I mean this is for the 20 June primary expiration cycle. This is huge. Absolutely huge. And that's very directional. And this is very proximal to earnings. Let's see again what this skew looks like. Huge call premium skew. 26 million. 26 million against one million on the put side. That's super directional. Let's take a look at just the overall activity for the last couple weeks. We already know that the puts have went off. So I'm going to turn the puts off for now. Let's get rid of this expiration cycle. Let's get rid of these strikes. And let's see what's on the call side. Yeah. I mean these are some absolutely sizeable trades. And these here are really interesting. Because these like it's a mix of bought in sold. But like the buys here at the 40s are a 26 delta. Like that is a directional bet. That's all that is you don't go out here and buy options in this time frame unless it is a directional bet. So that looks like a directional bet to me. And let's take a look at size really quick. I'm going to clear out the sale for now. The size isn't that crazy. And a lot of these look like rolling positions out a week because a lot of people play the front and game stop. Which is kind of curious. But I mean take a look. Right. So three of those larger trades that we were looking at of these here. Let's sort of buy premium again. So if we take a look at the million plus there's four of them that are on the put side and they're all super high delta. So that's a synthetic stock position. We have these are short calls. These look like covered calls because they're pretty far out of the money. They're at like a 16 delta. Then we have more of those in the money puts more synthetic shares. Then we have a directional bet because this is at the money one million. Two more series of short calls. These are a little more interesting because these are at the money. But these are far out in time. So that can be a bunch of different things. That can be a risk reversal. Meaning a synthetic stock position. It's hard to tell what else is coupled with that. And then the largest in terms of premium over the last couple weeks is the directional bet for the 20th of June using 1.8 mil. And then in the beginning of May, I remember seeing these. These were really far out in time. Really, really far out in time. So these I couldn't really make heads or tails on what it was. But I also remember that these were pretty big volume. Yeah, so 13 times volume over open interest. Those were big positions. And let's take a look over the last two months. Yeah, those were the big trades. So most of the big trades here are synthetic stock positions using deep in the money puts. There's a couple really big trades that were at the money slash in the money on the call side, but super far out in time, 2027. And then there's just a few of these near term expiration 20 June that's the larger speculative direction size, which is super interesting. So overall, it looks like the market has a couple specific themes in mind with respect to its positioning. It does look like the 35 handle is nothing crazy for it to be able to move over if it feels like it. We can see really persistent bullish option flow from the call side, also from short puts coming in here. So these are people also playing ball. I'm right now I have mostly short puts for the coverage triangle that I'm running in there. So that makes this look more bullish to me. And if we take a look at the actual options chain and the premiums, like we're talking about before, big, big call skew, big call skew, big call skew, and big call skew, all of them with respect to call premiums purchase. So that looks pretty directional expectation to the upside to me. That's broadly what I'm seeing here. What questions you have? What should we look at anything in here that you want to double click into? Let me know. I'm going to go through the last couple news pieces really fast out of curiosity. I do think this is a big part of it with the with the Bitcoin, with the Bitcoin momentum. I definitely think that. The problem is is that their Bitcoin position still like, what does that reflect? What does their Bitcoin position reflect as part of their balance sheet? What does game stops Bitcoin position reflect relative to the balance sheet? Let us see. 6.4 billion, 4.7 billion, cash, 25 March, they're going to add Bitcoin 1.5 billion through senior notes. So 6.25 billion in cash and securities, 1.48 billion from the notes, so. So if it invested 1.48 billion with Bitcoin around 70, it would hold 21,142 Bitcoin worth 2.36 billion at 110 Bitcoin on 22 May, which is about 880 million unrealized gains. So let's do it before all the gains and shit. So 1.48 billion divided by 6.25 billion. So it's like 24%. Well, that's a lie because they raised the debt. That was stupid math. It was 24% relative to the cash, but they raised 1.5 billion. So that's 6.25 plus 1.5. So 775. So then 1.48 divided by 775. 19%, just shy of 20%. That's still a significant amount of the company. So it looks like, I mean, the company is without a doubt going to have sensitivity to Bitcoin movements with 20% of the balance sheet in it. And that's a conservative number. We don't know exactly where that will land. So yeah, this will, I imagine you'll start to see not purely like a super strong correlation, but I do think you'll start to see more of a correlation emerge with respect to Bitcoin. So Sunny says, did you talk about the deep in the money puts yet? I did. I also talked about them in a standalone video. So if you have any questions on it, let me know. To me, it just looks like synthetic stock. That's mostly what I'm seeing. And Masha says, if you were trying to build a large position but didn't want to move the price, would you use short puts? Well, what do you mean? I would need way more context than that because because because the option trade is going to look a lot different than if you hold the equity. So that wouldn't be the, that wouldn't be the main thing that I would be worried about, aka trying to build a larger position and not move the price. So I would need to know the context on why that would be the goal. And then that would inform whether or not like in the money short put position would, would correspondingly make sense. So it's a little tricky. Dave Swagg says, how does that impact the current price action market makers needing to keep those shares on hand? No, they don't, they're not worried about that. Can you talk about the market plumbing behind starting a position like that? Who would use a strategy? How often? I mean, it's not really that crazy. It's just a synthetic stock position. You can build them a bunch of different ways. It's mostly done by institutions. And it's for a bunch of different reasons. Part of it is because it might complement the way that the rest of the portfolio looks. Part of it might be because you're not super confident that the underlying is going to have some sort of massive upside move. So you want to collect a little bit of theta because even if you go super far out in time on deep in the money puts, there's still extrinsic value that you still will collect. So it also might complement the broader portfolio a little bit better. There's a capital efficiency side of things versus buying it outright. So there can be a bunch of different reasons behind doing it. But one of the things is the market maker doesn't need to keep anything on hand for the short putts because remember, if you're short put, what does that mean with respect to your relationship with the stock? It means that you are on the hook to buy the stock. So if you're a short put, you can't exercise. Only the counterparty can exercise. So the market maker wouldn't have to worry about the short put at all. They're indifferent to them. Now it's completely different for like a short for being short a call that can be exercised. That's a whole other bag. So yeah, I think I don't really think it's a ton. I don't think it's like a ton of like any overly complicated positioning. You can look across most underlines and see part effects of those kinds of positions in the options chain. Let me get caught up. Rudebegit says the thing is I already own Bitcoin. So I'm overexposed to it now. That actually is it. That's in that's good for you to identify that. Because that's a tricky thing that people are dealing with right now. It's one of the things when you're adding stuff to the portfolio, you typically are trying to build a portfolio that reflects your views and what you want. And you have to look at things in total. So I think you're analyzing GameStop and their their potential Bitcoin holdings effectively. Because you're right. If you don't want to have overexposure depending on what your preferences are, then you might have to start looking at adjusting what your Bitcoin exposure is so that it reflects the correct amount of your portfolio. Because again, even if we're using the general estimate of, you know, anywhere between 10 and 20%. That's a lot to hold in something as volatile as Bitcoin. Because just as it's going up now, which is great, it can it also does go down, which makes it difficult, right? When that's eroding value on the balance sheet that you might need at a point in time. So my guess is they're probably viewing it as more of a strategic investment longer term. Because that I think makes sense. Bitcoin is well positioned, I think, to continue growing. Like I think overall. Oh, Roy and Clity says, was there a change semi-recently that allows companies to show crypto gains as profit? I don't know. I don't know anything about that. But I mean, you still would report it on the balance sheet, right? Like if you're holding it, you still have to represent what your assets are. So you'll absolutely be able to track what the change over quarter over quarter is in that asset value. Because it like it matters. It's part of the valuation of the company. So yeah. What CIF says, equity could be shares. This could be a plan from DFV's end. Equity could be shares. I don't follow. That confuses me. Mr. Rover says, what if those puts were bought to open instead of the market and the market maker had to be short those deep in the money puts and then hedge by short in the underlying? A few things. One, we don't we don't know with certainty whether they're bought or sold, but it's unbelievably likely that they were sold based on what we can see. Now, if somebody did choose to buy them, the market maker doesn't really have to worry about hedging for some time. The reason is because early exercise doesn't make sense financially, unless there's certain edge circumstances where it does. So you wouldn't buy those options and then exercise. So there's very little risk of assignment risk. And the other thing is if somebody did exercise those, it would be absolute gift to whoever's on the other side of it. Because if you exercise those puts, then you can essentially get out at a much better rate using spot price. So it literally wouldn't literally wouldn't matter at all. The time that it actually, because right, I don't know, there's what it, because what I just said makes sense. If you have questions on this shit, let me know because I just, I don't know this. I'm still used to talking about this stuff that it's all very native to me. And sometimes I'm ignorant in understanding where like somebody else might be with what I'm talking about. So always, if I'm saying some shit that you don't understand, please tell me so that I can explain it. But I just wouldn't make sense for the early exercise. So I think that that scenario is not fully impossible, but it's unbelievably improbable. And all the evidence points to the kind of a different scenario. Captain Bob says, what if the US government with the US government looking to buy Bitcoin? Do you think that the investment more into Bitcoin would be more beneficial than say S&P? I don't think it's a bad thesis, but I would struggle to say whether or not it's better than S&P. And it's because of a lot of different reasons. But the broad value of Bitcoin still hasn't stabilized. And if it's ever going to behave like a currency, it can't continue appreciating forever. It's going to have to stabilize. Otherwise, it will absolutely never operate as a currency. And that's a big part of the value proposition for it. So I think there's nothing wrong with holding it. And I mean, I hold Bitcoin. I think it's an interesting thing. And I think that it's a good speculative investment. But I do think that the like equities have a place in a portfolio for a reason. And it's for a bunch of different reasons, but they provide different use cases, in my opinion. Mateo says, well, I believe the premise of Bitcoin scarcity is allies. Bitcoin is practically divisible in millions of Satoshi's. So in terms of liquidity, it will never be scarce. It's price goes up by cybercrime. I think it's going to act more like digital gold. Ruta Begis says I think it's going to act more like digital gold. Yeah. And I mean, it eventually might. The problem is is the reason why gold is worth what it is is because it has intrinsic value. Something like Bitcoin doesn't necessarily have intrinsic value. Now you can argue that the modality of intrinsic value has changed a lot. And intrinsic value can include non-physical applications, right? So like actual privacy of transactions and stuff like that. So I personally wouldn't argue that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. I would just say it's a different kind of intrinsic value than a physical commodity. But that stuff aside, the main thing that Bitcoin will eventually have to do is stabilize in order for it to truly be widely adopted. Like we're talking about right now, GameStop holding essentially 10%, just 10% of its balance sheet in Bitcoin and how wild the swings can be on that alone. So because of that kind of thing, it does force you to consider like for larger institutions. Where's the right place to put your assets? And it's probably not going to be a significant amount of your assets and something that is effectively schizophrenic. Now I do think a lot of them will speculate in it. But a speculative position is completely different than like something that you're trying to base adoption off of. Because I mean, literally just looking at it, it's absolutely insane. The kind of moves that Bitcoin has had even in the last three years. So yeah, I find Bitcoin really interesting because I do think it has a long term value proposition. But I think the adoption of the value proposition is the tricky part. Lauren says, I don't understand the difference between Bitcoin and corn. Nobody ever actually owns corn or gold. How is Bitcoin different? I don't naturally understand what you mean by that. Because people like do physically purchase coin or corn and Bitcoin. And a big difference is corn is used in a lot of physical processes. So if I'm to make sake, oh no, that's rice. If I'm to make whatever that uses corn tortilla chips, I need corn in order to make them. I need physical corn. There's nothing that I need Bitcoin to do. Same thing with gold. There's manufacturing processes and things that physically need gold in order to complete whatever the production is of those items other than just wearing it around your neck. I need gold for those. And again, like, I don't need Bitcoin for any of those yet. I will say yet. Lauren says in the market, people aren't buying physical corn. Oh, that's different. That's different. So when you're talking in the market context of like corn futures, people are not buying physical corn futures. The retail trading side of things here are actually people that are speculating simply on the price of corn. However, the primary users of coin futures are people like farmers that produce corn that are using the futures contract to stabilize their price profile. That's the entire point of futures. Now, they allow speculators in because who doesn't want to allow some degenerates in to start throwing their money away? It, I mean, functionally does provide liquidity and stuff like that. But the main users of coin futures are people who have exposure to the price of coin. Corn, they use it literally to stabilize price. It's like the same thing that you see with planes in the price of jet fuel. The margins for airlines is really, really sensitive to the price of jet fuel. So if for whatever reason, there's a big conflict in jet fuel starts to get super expensive for whatever the case is, that can absolutely murder the margins for jets because their margins aren't fantastic. So they use things like futures to hedge that risk so that if it does happen, meanwhile, they would be losing, quote unquote, at the pump. They're making it back on the hedge. So that's really the main use of futures on the marketplace is actually for people that have some sort of supply chain sensitivity to whatever that commodity, whatever that instrument is, people use it for currencies. If I'm doing a deal with another country and it's predicated on a deal that's going to happen six months from now based on a price agreed to today, I have currency risk. I can hedge that currency risk today so that I can make the money on the deal. I'm not trying to make money on the hedge. I'm just trying to decrease my risk in the currency so that I can make the money from the deal and not lose the money from the relationship between the currency over that duration. So yeah, that's why those are completely different than something like Bitcoin. The overall use for futures on the open market is completely different.
