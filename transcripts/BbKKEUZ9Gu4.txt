650.00s: I
652.00s: I
654.00s: I
656.00s: that it's a message, right? Because there's absolutely nothing,
662.88s: nothing at all that would hurt him from continuing to follow Ryan Cohen, right? Even if he didn't like
669.04s: him anymore, I'm just talking hypothetically. I have no idea. But even if he didn't like him anymore,
674.08s: if he didn't like GameStop, like if all of these things were true, he still loses nothing by
680.00s: just continuing to follow Cohen and leaving things as the status quo. So I don't think those other
686.16s: things were necessarily the case, by the way. But I'm using it to pose an argument. And the argument
691.28s: is he wouldn't have done this unless he wanted that message to be known because this is one of the
696.56s: ways he communicates. And it's really interesting. So I have no idea what the theories are related to
703.52s: this. But I definitely think it means something. Otherwise, again, you wouldn't do it.
709.36s: So I find that kind of curious.
713.52s: Roryn Cleary says maybe he's over GameStop. That kind of thing is so hard to say.
723.28s: It's like really, really hard to say. Because there is the fact that we know he moved,
730.48s: not out necessarily. We don't know. We can't confirm that he moved out when he went into Chewie.
737.28s: But even the fact that it was Chewie is kind of telling something because that's Cohen's company.
748.32s: Right. So like there's still an attachment there in some way. And then there was the other
753.28s: post I remember you guys showed me where it was like the office. And it was like the GameStop
758.80s: shaking hands with the cat. So there's like that.
764.08s: Lauren says that theories he's going to be on the board, but not sure why he would unfollow RC
768.08s: because of that. Yeah, I don't think that would make any sense at all. I mean, that literally
772.80s: is just completely illogical. I also don't, I also don't really follow why, why people think he's
782.00s: going to try to like be on the board. I don't get that. Roryn Cleary says, did you miss the part
788.40s: where he unpinned his original DD to eat? No, no, no, I didn't. And I appreciate you bringing it
792.16s: up. Sorry to me to skip over. I'm just segmenting first before looking at things. When looking at
797.52s: something like this, like those those two things, I kind of look at them as individuals. And then I
802.80s: look at them as a composite to try to get a sense of what the breadth of evidence is saying so that
812.24s: I can try to have an idea of what what the motivations and what might be.
819.04s: But yeah, the board thing doesn't make literally any sense at all to me. So let's see what the
827.04s: let's see what's up. Let the 10 begin. That's good.
831.36s: And okay. Okay, so then somebody highlighted this, the GameStop YouTube video.
842.32s: This is hilarious. I literally love I love this. This is so funny.
850.56s: So funny. Let's see. I'm trying to figure out like what the what the actual theories are.
858.96s: Can look at the past. Give us an indication last year. He liked to tweet a few days before
863.36s: starting to tweet again. This year likes are no longer visible. So we took another action that he
869.52s: knew would be visible to some keen eyed people yet far less visible than a tweet. But like what's
874.56s: the point of that? Right? He 100,000 trading algos with direct API access to his tweet. So with
885.76s: this action, he could just be announcing his impending return to a certain group of highly regarded
891.28s: and that's fascinating. I mean, I don't understand why because when we're talking about the algos
902.64s: that might be watching his movements, if he makes the tweet on a weekend, the movement in the
909.60s: stock is already muted, no matter what. So it would probably trade pretty haywire following the
917.76s: open that, you know, whenever the next open is. But I don't see the motive behind why he would
925.76s: execute that way. I don't see RK unfollowing RC is having any basis in arcade no longer
933.84s: agreeing with the direction that RC is taking the company. I think it's a lot more likely that he
938.40s: knew we'd notice it. It may not have happened. How do you unfollowed a different rando and it's,
945.36s: I just don't know, man.
951.76s: Yeah, I don't agree with this just because it doesn't really logically make sense.
958.72s: If the goal is to try to like come back without coming back, he could post a million different
966.56s: things or he could make a comment on a million different things that don't necessarily directly
971.68s: link back to GameStop. So and even that, I'm not sure what the overarching motive would be
980.32s: to try to make a post without being linked to games, like I just don't get all that. So I don't
989.44s: fully follow, but again, like I don't have a good counter theory, so I'm not attempting to take
995.76s: these down and deconstruct them. I don't have a good argument to post back because it just doesn't
1001.68s: make sense to me. So right now what I'm doing is just trying to see what it could be, right? Like
1007.12s: what logically might this be? Have all eyes on the page for what's the calm. See, like this is
1013.36s: the thing though, is that like if he just posts whatever is to come, the attention's already there.
1019.12s: So I agree with this part though on the idea of building some sort of hype. And I also think that
1027.04s: he is a troll. I think he has fun playing games. And again, I always go back to that video of Ryan
1034.48s: Cohen and people in that interview where they were talking about like the things he was holding,
1041.20s: the games that what order the games were in the background and Ryan Cohen was just like
1045.76s: no dog. It's literally just a picture, but everybody's like reading in so far. Now the weird part
1052.96s: about it though that I do find interesting is that I imagine he has to feel some level of like
1060.80s: a social contract with when he communicates and the impact it has on a lot of people. I know I
1068.00s: would. And I imagine he's a pretty thoughtful dude. And what I mean by this is there are so many
1074.24s: people who their entire investment lives revolve around GameStop that like any monochum of evidence
1082.24s: that the cat is around the cat is doing something has an effect on those kinds of people.
1088.16s: So I'm not convinced that he would be interested in like teasing them because honestly,
1093.92s: it's kind of fucked up. And I wouldn't I wouldn't do that. And I imagine he probably wouldn't want
1098.72s: to do that either. So that's why I think that there's probably some other message or some other
1106.64s: thing. He's coily conveying, but it's essentially impossible to tell as per usual, right? Because
1118.80s: that's one of the interesting things about the modality of communication is that and that's why
1124.64s: that's why we know he likes to troll because you can make cryptic communication that's still
1132.80s: decipherable. A lot of the things that he does, they're so cryptic that literally armies of people
1139.76s: trying to figure out what it is, can't figure out what it is. That's not communication.
1144.08s: Right? That's not what communication is. And even if you wanted to make it difficult to get to
1149.04s: the message, a great example of this is the emoji timeline. I cannot tell you how many theories
1153.92s: I've seen on the emoji timeline and how many I haven't seen one that's actually panned out.
1159.92s: So that to me would tell me that there's not inherently the super intricate meaning for each
1166.32s: emoji in the emoji timeline. And why? Because I do think that there's an element of him that he enjoys
1174.32s: playing around having fun. But I am curious how he balances that with the impact he knows he has
1180.96s: on people because it's perfect example. This is one subreddit. He did two things and this thing is
1190.88s: 6,000 likes and 721 comments over the course of two days. That's incredible engagement again in one
1201.36s: vacuum. So he absolutely knows this impact. And it's super, super interesting to think about
1210.80s: from like a game theory perspective, you know, what the overall idea was. So let's see.
1220.80s: If you were done with GameStop, you would just be done, fade out, not sent out any type of
1224.56s: signals, buckle up. That could be. He's not following because he intends to lead. Funny. Yeah,
1240.16s: I don't see anything. There's nothing in here that strikes me as like, ah, yeah, this makes sense.
1244.88s: Now, this was two days ago. When he when he did this. Or is this two days ago when we found out,
1260.88s: I imagine we would have found out pretty close. So if we take a look at 24th to the 22nd,
1269.68s: I mean, that's hard to. The timing of that is impeccable. Yeah, with the move. But the timing of it
1294.56s: aside, this move had already started. So that might have been a little bit of fuel to the fire or
1301.44s: something, but really, really interesting. Ryan, Ryan says, I think he's just sitting back
1311.68s: messes and messing around and joining folks try to analyze his changes. I definitely think that,
1315.68s: yeah, I agree with that. I think that that's a part of it. I really do think he enjoys trolling a
1319.84s: little bit. He has fun. And we can see that reflected in a few different ways. And Cohen also
1326.32s: does the same thing. Now again, I do think the unfollowing thing is like, that's a pretty universal
1332.48s: symbol, right? If I unfollow somebody, it's it's generally because like, I'm not interested in what
1339.84s: they're doing. And that doesn't mean inherently that like, I don't like them or I hate them or
1345.60s: anything like that. But for me specifically, I curate my feeds super, super carefully because
1355.20s: there's so much bullshit on social media. So that's how I make sure that like, I'm getting decent
1360.64s: stuff that I want to look at. But in this context, I'm not convinced that that fully, fully applies here.
1370.16s: So yeah.
1378.56s: Lauren says, do you know why unfollow people? Because I don't care for them anymore.
1382.96s: See, yeah, I totally get that. You could be temporarily out of GME like potentially
1388.88s: did with Chewy. Maybe you sold to raise capital for something else. That could be. Yeah, that kind
1394.32s: of thing could be. I think the, the, we would see it though, right? So if we just take a look at
1404.00s: what his last position was before leaving, there would absolutely be artifacts of him exiting. And
1412.88s: I mean, at least as of late, we don't necessarily see that. But it could be depending on like even,
1419.76s: he might not have exited most recently, right? He could have exited at any point. We have no idea
1425.28s: because it's been a while. So absolutely could be. But I would imagine that if it was some sort of
1433.04s: precipitous exit, we would have seen some signs, which I don't think we picked up on.
1437.52s: I don't know.
1439.28s: Uh, Sneal says RC and followed Bitcoin, RK, RK and followed hold on RC unfollowed BTC Bitcoin,
1451.76s: Roryn Kitty unfollowed Cohen.
1459.12s: I don't actually get that. When did Cohen unfollow Bitcoin?
1467.84s: I don't know when Cohen unfollowed Bitcoin was at the same day because that would be kind of
1477.92s: interesting. April 22nd, so like a month ago.
1487.76s: Hmm.
1492.64s: Interesting.
1493.36s: Okay.
1495.36s: A mashing says the tin I here is RK unfollowed RC because he's no longer following him in
1501.76s: share count as he passed RC. I find it hard to believe he would have that many shares.
1509.36s: Yeah.
1512.64s: I mean, I don't really buy it because we would have to see filings if he did.
1518.32s: Like if he accumulated more, there would still be additional filings for the share
1522.64s: side of the equation, which we haven't seen.
1526.48s: So yeah, I don't think it's that.
1530.80s: Who knows? As always, the cat does what the cat wants and everybody's just kind of like
1537.52s: sat trying to look at it and see if there's anything we can piece out of it. But to that end,
1544.96s: what I want to do is poke through. We'll take a look. I think the two main names
1550.56s: that people wanted to take a look at were hymns and so-fi. So we'll take a look at those
1554.80s: and then we'll take a look at GameStop. I'll give you an update on the GameStop Covered Strangle
1559.84s: that I have on. We'll take a look at the options and everything. Now, if you're one of the people
1563.76s: that asked me to look at hymns or so-fi, if you have any any additional context on just,
1569.12s: if it's just a general thing that you want to look at, if you have a specific question about
1572.40s: something, let me know. But boring that, I'm just going to poke through them broadly really fast.
1577.92s: So we'll start with hymns. And this one was really interesting to me simply because of the
1585.52s: movement, right? The overall fact pattern that we see here. We can see that it literally rallied
1593.20s: 200% over the course of like a month. And then from that 200% rally, it crashed
1602.16s: 68% and from that 68% crash, it rallied 175%. Crazy. Like absolutely crazy moves. Now, the interesting
1617.20s: thing here though is it's almost slightly cyclical. And if we're looking at the price behavior,
1624.48s: I mean, it had the parabolic rise into the earnings release, earnings release punished it.
1630.64s: And then it fell down essentially to the prior consolidation levels before that, which is
1636.00s: super interesting. And then it had a good earnings. And then now we obviously sit where we sit.
1643.36s: So let's take a quick look at the options chain and see what we can learn from here.
1649.52s: And I imagine we'll see a few things. I imagine that we'll see pretty defiant. Okay, I'm wrong
1654.88s: right out of the gate. Perfect start. I was going to say that I expected to see bigger skew. I
1659.76s: didn't have an opinion on call versus put, but I thought it would be a bigger difference between
1665.04s: them specifically because when things make these kinds of parabolic moves most frequently,
1669.44s: there is a defined expectation of follow on price movement of some sort, which we're just not
1675.44s: necessarily seeing just yet. So that's interesting. Now, if we break this out into the various
1682.88s: expiration cycles, run expiration is leaning short, which makes complete sense to me after the move
1690.96s: and after the roll over that we're starting to see. And then six June bullish skew ever so slightly,
1698.48s: 13 June bearish skew, 20 June heavy bearish skew. So there's actually pretty decent in terms of
1706.00s: OI. And as everybody that follows the channel knows, OI only tells part of the story. It tells us
1714.56s: what's most active, but it doesn't tell us where the money is. So as grand possible in skis to
1721.20s: say money talks bullshit walks. So now we got to figure out where the money is because that will
1728.16s: tell us a lot in terms of how the market is expecting the moves. So we'll take a look at
1737.60s: a couple charts. Let's sort this by premium. Huge huge huge huge put premium skew over the calls.
1749.60s: Huge. That's 6.8 million in puts against 3.6 million on calls. That is bearish skew.
1760.80s: And then we can see bullish skew for the 30th. That's fascinating because think of this. I was
1768.16s: just showing you this expiration cycle in terms of OI. Look at this way more puts. But then if we
1777.52s: look at the actual amount of premium in those puts, it's not that much. What that tells us is
1783.20s: those are people buying further out of the or trading, I should say we don't know inherently no
1787.36s: buying, but trading further out of the money puts, which is generally more directional actually
1792.88s: in terms of expectation as compared to something that's at the money or in the money. But the reason why
1796.96s: we know that is because of the price. If open interest is really high, but total premium is low,
1802.32s: that means that we're getting stuff that's pretty far out of the money.
1808.08s: So that's pretty curious. Let's take a look at the next primary expiration. It looks like call
1814.08s: side. So it looks like from a premium lens, this is still like pretty bullishly set up,
1821.92s: which I'm not sure that I would necessarily have my bingo card because this is still absolutely
1830.40s: downwards loping. But and we didn't really post a higher low until now. So if it consolidates here,
1839.76s: I mean, this can actually be a pretty healthy launch point. So what I'm going to do is set a couple
1846.40s: alerts just at a curiosity and see if it starts breaking above. And then the last thing I want to do
1852.48s: is just look at all. And then we'll move on to the next. Let's take a look at the
1861.36s: vol curve specifically. This will be the volatility surface. But we'll do the out of the
1867.92s: monies. And then let's do the primary explorations. Yeah. I mean, standard. This is different in terms
1877.44s: of what you typically see in meme stocks. A lot of times in meme stocks is you guys know full well
1881.68s: by now. You guys have seen this. That's one of the cool things, by the way, for anybody that's
1887.60s: followed along for even a decent number of the episodes we've done for these Saturday series is
1893.28s: episode 41 is you've seen things multiple times at this point and are actually subconsciously
1901.20s: learning, even if sometimes consciously it might escape you. And being able to look at a volatility
1907.60s: surface and use that to come up with an analysis of where you think something might go is an
1913.92s: incredible skill. And it's because options are really, really informed traits. They're leveraged.
1921.36s: And you don't seek leverage in size unless you have a pretty good idea of what you think might
1926.56s: happen. So the fact that you're able to look at this and follow along with me is awesome. And if
1932.96s: you're not, that's totally cool. Again, there are people that probably the first time they saw
1937.92s: anything like this will have absolutely no idea what this was. But I'm sure people in the chat
1942.72s: will tell you that over time as you look at it more and more, it really does start to make sense.
1948.16s: And that's one of the coolest things about options is they give you a probabilistic lens to view
1953.84s: the world as compared to just guessing, which is pretty sick. Okay. So anyways, all that aside,
1961.36s: we can see that the tails are big on the out of the money puts. So this typically is favoring a
1969.20s: higher probability of a larger, I'm sorry, of a smaller of a larger total downside move,
1978.88s: lower probability. Let me rephrase that because I lost myself in the middle. I don't want to confuse
1982.80s: you. When you see the tail this high, it means that there's a higher probability of a larger move,
1988.88s: but a lower probability that the move itself will actually happen. And then when you see
1993.92s: wall to the upside muted like this, that's a higher probability of a smaller move. That's what this
2000.16s: is telling us. So you can see that it's absolutely favoring a higher probability of a smaller
2006.00s: upside move, but we're seeing normal skew. So this is kind of standard fair. But super interesting to
2014.40s: me, at least hopefully interesting to you as well. Okay. If there's any follow on questions for
2021.04s: him, let me know. Otherwise, we will move on to the next in our list. But before we do that,
2027.12s: there is a small creature scratching at my door post dinner. And if you know who it is, you know who it is.
2036.48s: One second.
2054.00s: All right. The man, the myth, the legend, he's ready to rock and roll. You can see, check him out.
2064.00s: He does have his tuxedo on. That's wrong way. See? Does have his tuxedo. He's dressed.
2072.96s: What are you doing? I think he's good. I feel like he's doing eye. So he is rip roaring to get back
2083.20s: into now. Still fine. Let's take a look at so fine.
2087.20s: Okay. So fine. Completely different story. Completely different story. It's last earnings it beat.
2101.76s: It looks like it didn't. It looks like it didn't have, like really accommodating move.
2111.28s: And definitely a defined downtrend. Now it is starting to reverse the like the broader trend.
2121.76s: We can see that here. It's always the basics higher high. Then we can see that that term high
2129.68s: swings. So then you see lower high. And then you see lower low from here. And then you see lower
2139.36s: high from here. Then you see lower low from here. This is the absolute standard for analyzing a trend.
2149.04s: So then we have the swing low. And it's starting to rally. So you can see a higher local high than here.
2157.52s: A higher local low than here and here. So this is the kind of thing that's in the middle. I would call
2165.84s: so we'll be able to take a look at a few things here. To get a better sense of what's going on.
2170.72s: And then we'll pivot over to to game stop because we actually have a lot to go over there. And I
2174.80s: want to make sure that we have plenty of time. But let's take a look at the options chain.
2182.24s: Lauren says side eye on point. That's right. That's Thor is the literally the the expert of the
2187.60s: side eye. Raphael says, Hey, everybody I'm new here. Welcome in. Raphael. That's a sick name.
2192.96s: I'm pretty sure that's one of the teenage mutant interturdles. If I'm not mistaken. Is that correct?
2197.52s: I know there's like Michael, Michael, Donna, Donna, Tello, Michael, Angelo.
2204.80s: I feel like Raphael is one. I remember splinter splinter is sick. It is. Yeah, okay, great.
2210.80s: Maybe that's what you're named after. Now one of the things that's super interesting here
2217.68s: is take a look at the call skew here. 1.8 mil against 1.1 mil. Again, as always, when you look at
2228.16s: open interest, open interest gives you just a piece of the puzzle. We can see the interest in
2237.44s: potentially things like units. So when we're analyzing options chains and options flows,
2245.12s: it's really important to understand the difference between these hot nitrogen says Raphael had that
2251.28s: three pronged pointy weapon thing. Oh, the, um, oh, I know exactly what you're talking about. Raphael
2260.72s: Ninja Turtle. Yeah. Yeah. Doesn't say what is look at this species mutant turtle. His home is
2274.56s: the New York sewers. I love this. This is so funny. That's so funny. Okay, but what's,
2286.08s: what's that thing called? I don't. What are those fucking things called? Anybody know?
2294.96s: Raphael Ninja Turtle weapon. Size. That's it. There we go. Some sweet size.
2306.56s: I feel like the size is just kind of a silly thing. It's just like a big fork
2314.40s: that doesn't have enough prongs. I'd be pretty pissed off with that. Okay, back to what I was just
2320.24s: talking about. I want to show you an important difference. And this will be a good learning point
2328.48s: very quickly about options. So if actually, let me open the options. Okay. So these are the puts.
2341.52s: These are out of the money. These are in the money. Further in the money equals higher delta.
2355.84s: Further out of the money is lower delta. We don't, we won't worry about gamma. The first question,
2364.56s: anybody that knows in the chat tell me is which one of these per lot per one lot cost more money
2378.00s: in the money or out of the money. Which one of them? Because this part matters.
2385.92s: And it'll make sense in the money. Perfect. So Snehe Hill, CW, Rubega, perfect. Good job,
2394.80s: guys. Same thing with aquafrost. All correct. In the money, these are more expensive.
2404.00s: Now we know that the in the money options are more expensive. So then why would I buy in the money
2412.72s: options if I know they're more expensive? The first thing to consider is which one of these
2423.52s: makes money on a smaller move out of the money or in the money? What's your guess? So say that we're
2432.64s: looking at so far and say that we're expecting a two point move. Which one of these would make more
2440.24s: money on a two point move? The out of the monies or the in the monies? Raphael says out of the money.
2451.60s: Aquafrost says out of the money. Rubega says in the money. Cdubs says in the money due to delta.
2458.72s: This is perfect. I'm glad that it split. Lauren off the top rope with the fucking authoritative in
2465.92s: the money. Lauren, you got it. It's in the money. In the money is make more money. So let's just
2473.68s: let's just do the math really fast. Let's say that you grab one of these and let's say that you
2484.48s: grab one of these and we compare. So the 16 calls actually I'll do it in Excel really quick. I think
2497.92s: this is a really, really good skill for you to be able to do on your own to make the comparison.
2504.40s: So let me grab our handy dandy workbook that always turns into a massive mess after a few moments.
2510.96s: But this is perfect. You get rid of all this and this will be super easy. So we need our strike price.
2520.40s: We need the delta. We need the gamma. We need the current premium. And then what we'll do is we'll
2527.92s: calculate P and L. We'll calculate value and P and L. So we have two strikes that we're looking at.
2540.64s: We're looking at the 10 strike in the 16 strike. We're looking at in 11 delta. And we're looking at
2546.88s: an 80 delta. I'm going to add a spot price input. Spot right now is 1309.
2563.68s: Sick. So now let's take a look at what our gamma is gamma here is .06.
2570.16s: And then on these your gamma is .1.
2583.36s: So premium on these is 20 cents. We'll call it. We'll just use the bids. And then these are 310.
2590.64s: Okay. So here's the beginning value of your option. And we're just going to do a one lot per.
2604.32s: So we have just your premium times 100. That gives you the current value.
2614.88s: Now let's say that spot changes.
2634.96s: And let's say that spot changes by two bucks. What's happened now?
2642.00s: Well, the first thing is we're now looking at 1509 for the underlying. Here's the important stuff,
2649.12s: though. What's happened to your delta?
2657.68s: In this case, your delta first provides a base move, which is the current delta.
2669.92s: However, it's also going to gain the gamma here. And it's going to do that over the course of two points.
2683.12s: You got a two point move. So your delta is going to move significantly. Now this isn't a direct comparison.
2695.20s: By the way, I'm just giving you the overall scale and scope of how these things will move.
2700.88s: Your delta here will also change. But remember, delta can only cap at one. So this isn't actually what your
2710.40s: delta is going to be also because I have this as 80. This should be .8. So your delta essentially would max
2719.28s: out. You get your delta of one. So now if we take a look at the P and L of these options,
2725.68s: it's really, really simple. Because if you take a look at the current value
2732.56s: and the current premium, your premium would change by your delta. So in this case, with a really
2738.88s: small move, you can clearly see that this option would not provide you as much of a P and L
2747.44s: change as this option. So going all the way back as to why this matters. Well, as we're analyzing
2757.36s: the options change for things, we actually care a lot about the split between open interest and
2766.32s: premium. Because if you have really high out of the money, open interest, it can mean different
2772.08s: things. But one of the things is if it's out of the money, you might be expecting a more severe move
2779.12s: because going back to this example, we know that the in the money is more expensive. So what does
2786.00s: that mean? Let's say that you wanted to buy $5,000 worth. Which one of these can you buy more
2795.52s: with the $5,000? Well, it's really simple. We're literally going to take our total bank roll
2802.40s: and we're going to divide it by the premium. And you can figure out how many you can purchase.
2809.28s: So in this case, it would just be your premium times 100 or you could use the other the value column
2813.92s: that I made or you could just delete everything because you've fat-fingered it. That's another choice.
2820.08s: Always another choice. But you take your $5,000, you divide it by the current value.
2831.28s: And this is not a dollar. This is just the number of lots that you can get.
2837.12s: The reason why this matters is because you can get way more units for the cheaper out of the
2845.28s: monies for the same value. So the other thing is you can actually decrease the total investment if
2851.60s: you're so inclined because you can get a pretty big position using less money. Now again,
2857.44s: what's the trade-off? As always, with options, there's a trade-off. The big trade-off here
2862.08s: is that you need a bigger move in order to make the money. And relative to how much premium is left
2868.72s: in the options, your theta decay is absolutely going to chew you away unless you get the move quickly.
2875.44s: That's what's going to happen. So anyways, back to this example. When I'm analyzing the
2881.68s: difference between these, oh, I is part of this. The next component, as you saw before, is we want to
2889.68s: look at what the actual premiums look like. Because that tells us our markets buying units or our
2898.80s: markets actually just generally speculating on a direction. So like this here, we can see that
2906.08s: there's fewer total puts on the next expiration cycle, but the premiums are about the same.
2914.40s: So that tells us a few things. We can take a look at the OI and then we can see what kind of
2920.64s: positions are being put on. So we can see that the OI is not quite double, but maybe 50% ish
2928.24s: greater for the call side than the put side, but the premiums are actually kind of close, 776
2935.20s: against 653. So we can tell that we're getting cheaper calls and we're getting more of them than
2942.32s: the puts. So the other thing that I care a lot about is what is the what is the order flow show me?
2951.36s: And what I'm looking for is is there some sort of programmatic build out? Or are we seeing
2962.40s: these are, oh, I changes is perfect. So what I want to know is are options being built? Or are we
2969.12s: seeing options being taken down and which ones and in what ratios? Because again, we can infer a lot
2977.76s: of information based on this and you can see that it's actually like kind of fair play between
2982.72s: both of them. There's a really very, very slight call skew in terms of OI, especially as you go
2988.32s: further out in time. This is common for companies that you expect to grow. So clearly, the longer term
2994.80s: option holders in SoFi are expecting it to grow. And again, we can get a sense of well, to what degree,
3002.48s: right? Again, money talks, bullshit walks. So we can figure out how far out we need to go in
3008.80s: terms of the explorations. I don't know how many of this will let us do.
3014.96s: This is great. So we can go effectively all the way out and take a look at this. 1.1 million in calls
3023.60s: against 102,000 puts. What does that tell you? Upside expectation long term. What do we see here?
3032.16s: 2026 June. Huge call premium skew. Same thing here in March. Same thing here in Feb. Same thing here,
3042.88s: even in 2026. It's in January. It's not exactly to the same degree that you saw down there, but it's
3048.48s: still double. So what I'm showing you is that the markets and the positioning you see is absolutely
3055.28s: expecting upside price activity over the long run. But in the near term, you can clearly see that
3061.20s: there are pockets of downside expectations like this here. This is a very clear pocket of downside
3067.44s: expectation. So again, this is how we can use options to infer a few different things.
3074.64s: So anyways, that effectively is what I'm seeing here now in terms of vol, vol is actually kind of
3081.12s: light in so far, which is curious. And it definitely seems to be favored to the downside.
3090.32s: For me, there's two levels that matter a lot to the upside. This is the first one. This is the
3095.36s: second one. And the reason why these levels matters because I want, and again, that's not like the
3101.20s: specific price levels just to be very clear for anybody that's not familiar with how I tend to do
3106.72s: these. I care about this. How does it behave in this volume node? That matters a lot to me.
3114.96s: And same thing here, we're in a volume node literally right now. So how does it behave in this
3122.24s: volume node? And the reason why these matter is because it tells us our holders looking to accumulate
3129.28s: more, or are they looking to unwind? Because right now we can absolutely see a clear trend of unwind.
3135.60s: So it looks like near term, slightly favored to the downside. But again, as always,
3145.04s: it's just one piece of new information or news that comes out that changes that. That's why
3149.60s: as a trader, you have to be really quick on your feet to adapt to markets. And it's because you have
3155.12s: to apply Bayesian analysis. Okay, cool. So that's so fine. Now we will move on to GameStop. We have a
3163.28s: lot to talk about here. I'm going to go grab a seltzer water super fast. I'll be right back.
3169.28s: And then we will get right into it. If there's any questions that you have on what we just talked about
3174.00s: or to either of the prior tickers, please throw it in the chat. And then if there's any specific
3179.12s: stuff you want to talk about relative to GameStop, also please throw that in the chat. VRB.
3253.28s: argument.
3275.92s: Oh, right. Good.
3278.80s: We back at it.
3279.68s: Let's take a look at the latest in GameStop.
3286.40s: The biggest thing by far is the last couple days, like by far.
3295.44s: Now it is coming up, not all two in the distant future on its next earnings release.
3303.92s: Let's take a look at the price activity broadly.
3307.96s: The line says, can we look at the options transactions between March 20th and now to see if there's
3311.80s: anything at all that might be RK?
3314.60s: I've looked at them already.
3316.36s: I haven't seen anything, but we can definitely take a look again together if you'd like.
3321.56s: But yeah, there really isn't much that I'm seeing.
3324.72s: Rafael says, I don't have any questions, but I'd like to thank you.
3327.96s: This is amazing.
3328.96s: You're doing congrats.
3329.96s: You guys meet here every Saturday.
3330.96s: Yeah, that's exactly correct.
3332.56s: So sometimes it's a live stream.
3334.60s: Sometimes it's a video.
3335.60s: I do these on live streams just because I know a lot of people enjoy looking at this together.
3339.20s: And I enjoy spending the time with you guys looking at it.
3342.68s: But yeah, we've been doing this for this is literally the 41st episode most weekends, a
3348.20s: couple miss.
3349.76s: But yeah, this is like pretty much every weekend.
3358.32s: Seat up says, is it possible to determine how much bearish resistance exists at 3435
3363.28s: on GameStop?
3364.28s: Yeah, we can take a look at that.
3365.24s: You can't really determine, quote, unquote, how much is like bearish resistance.
3370.76s: But we can take a look at what the total overhead resistance might look like.
3382.88s: It's not crazy to me, which doesn't like, that's what I would expect to see simply because
3389.20s: it hasn't traded up there that much, right?
3391.52s: So the volume node is pretty light.
3394.48s: But what I'm doing here is I'm getting an idea of how many people transacted at these
3402.04s: levels.
3403.28s: When I'm using the volume profile, what I'm essentially saying is at what price points
3407.76s: are people willing to transact.
3410.84s: And I also am curious how many people are holding bags that might be incentivized to get
3418.20s: out.
3419.20s: So for example, like here, like this is still volume up here at the 55 handle.
3424.92s: That like this is people that transacted at the bought at 55.
3429.48s: So when price gets up to these levels, typically speaking, you will see people like this that
3433.76s: are like, oh shit, I'm just happy to get the fuck out of this thing because I've been holding
3438.12s: it since it hit 55 and it hasn't been back there.
3442.24s: But you can see how light that volume is.
3444.64s: So what that means is as those people are happy to relieve their bags and try to cover
3449.32s: at least for a small loss or break even or whatever they choose, if there's a lot of
3454.04s: volume, that provides a lot of selling pressure.
3456.96s: Again, if a specific number of them choose to unwind there.
3461.44s: So there's a couple factors that go into that in my brain, which is how far is the volume
3468.44s: node off of spot price and for how long?
3471.28s: If it's been there for a really long time where people have been hanging out super, super
3474.92s: far away, then I tend to find that they're a little more eager to sell when price eventually
3481.72s: navigates to those levels.
3484.96s: So from a just volume node perspective, there really isn't much volume at the 3435 handle.
3492.24s: We haven't even traded at the 35 handle until the squeeze in May and June.
3500.12s: So that doesn't look super significant to me.
3504.72s: Now the other thing that we can look at is as always, we can look at the options chain
3509.84s: and we can get a sense at the 35 handle what kind of positions exist, whether to maybe
3517.80s: add a little bit of steam or to potentially hurt upward movement.
3527.12s: And that'll be based more so on the hedging activity.
3530.80s: None of these are what I want.
3532.08s: What do I want?
3534.44s: No.
3535.44s: Did this one?
3537.48s: This is not what I want.
3541.08s: Oh, I know what I want.
3542.08s: My bad.
3543.08s: My bad guys.
3544.08s: I know what I want.
3545.08s: This one.
3548.48s: So the 35 handle is mostly calls, like 46,800 calls.
3555.32s: Like actually pretty significant calls.
3559.64s: So that provides bullish pressure, at least from a market maker hedging lens.
3568.74s: So we can kind of see that at the 35 handle, but it's broadly it's light.
3574.72s: There's just not a ton.
3580.12s: In terms of rapidly being built out, in terms of what sits there, it's still relatively
3587.80s: light.
3588.80s: You're going to see more of it at like the 20s, 25s.
3591.64s: So the short answer to all of that is it doesn't look like a ton.
3596.68s: There's not a lot of overhead transactions that have occurred there.
3600.60s: So I wouldn't necessarily think that there's a lot of existing overhead pressure.
3606.28s: So then the next question becomes when do people decide to start unwinding their shares?
3611.08s: And it's not the kinds of people referring to are larger holders.
3617.96s: So let's ask Grock really quick.
3621.56s: Can you break down the current holders of GameStop stock institutions, versus retail and
3631.64s: breakdown by institution?
3636.56s: The reason why institution matters is because they are not inherently waiting for a squeeze.
3645.88s: Some of them will by the way.
3646.88s: There are some institutions that absolutely will try to trade for squeezes.
3652.32s: However, that doesn't really represent the larger bucket.
3659.44s: So let's see.
3661.52s: Institutional owner retail investors are like 60 and a half percent right now equating
3665.48s: to 258 million shares.
3671.68s: 75.4 million shares 25% are DRS.
3680.32s: Exposed estimate retail ownership at 52 million shares after accounting for institutional insider.
3689.36s: Institutional ownership is at 31 to 34%.
3694.88s: So 132 to 144 insiders is 8.5 to 22.
3703.28s: Okay.
3706.52s: So Vanguard right now has 33.6 mil shares at 1.04 billion.
3718.08s: And it looks like they're the largest holder from an institutional lens.
3727.04s: So what I'm looking for is evidence of.
3733.88s: A mansion says you're not looking at GM.
3735.68s: No, I am sorry.
3736.68s: I was in looking at another page.
3739.48s: I was reading off of Grock.
3742.12s: I wasn't looking.
3743.12s: Oh, for the 35 handle.
3744.52s: That's my bad.
3745.52s: My bad.
3746.52s: Oh, decent at the 35.
3758.68s: Definitely decent at the 35.
3760.08s: That's also because is that 33.
3761.92s: That makes way more sense now.
3763.12s: I was wondering why the 35 would have been so like so super, super close.
3766.84s: But anyways, back to the institutional accumulation and whatnot.
3773.76s: That part matters to me quite a lot because we can get a sense of what kind of trading
3781.72s: activity might we see at different points.
3785.56s: So if we look at institutional transactions, let's see.
3792.48s: We're going to look at the last.
3797.36s: Two years.
3800.20s: We definitely net gain.
3804.16s: And you can see the price is about 31.
3807.52s: So it looks like they're generally interested in it at like the 30 handle and it does look
3811.84s: like it's expanding.
3815.80s: So yeah, I mean, to me, it looks like the 35 handle is, I mean, very much breachable.
3823.84s: So if we take a look at just a probability cone.
3831.60s: And let's take a look at the probability of being in the money specifically.
3835.44s: And let's take a look at the 35 handle.
3838.32s: And let's take a look over the next month primary expiration.
3841.72s: I mean, there's right now a 37% chance of expiring effectively above the 30% chance
3853.80s: of the 35 handle.
3855.68s: And one standard deviation move would put us at like the 44 handle.
3860.92s: So yeah, I don't necessarily think the 35 handle looks like too much from an overhead
3868.36s: lens.
3869.36s: To me, it's likely more a factor of if people start unwinding to book profits there.
3877.84s: I think something like that.
3880.12s: All right.
3882.36s: Let's see.
3883.36s: I know there's a couple more questions.
3889.20s: I got to open door for three.
3893.00s: Okay.
3897.00s: Now we have a post dinner, Thor.
3903.80s: Um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um,
3909.48s: day swag says I'd like to discuss how covered call traders got ran over by the 30 call
3914.60s: wall this past week and rolling up and out in general volume.
3918.40s: Yeah.
3919.40s: We could definitely take a look at them.
3920.68s: They're, they're really not going to be in a bad spot.
3923.92s: And it's because they're going to be able to, um, roll them like it's not going to be
3930.00s: that, that challenging.
3931.84s: So if I take a look, I still think I might be in all options and game stop if I'm not
3936.48s: mistaken.
3939.48s: Yeah.
3940.48s: I'm still all options in game stop.
3944.48s: Um, let's take a look at.
3952.12s: Let's take a look.
3953.68s: So if we eyeball, uh, for what I want to do, I think on demand won't let us look at Friday.
3969.04s: We can look at Thursday though.
3970.68s: That's close enough.
3971.68s: What I want to do is look at the option chain on Thursday so that we can see if somebody
3976.08s: had 30 calls on the 23rd, what they could do with them because they absolutely, it's
3982.72s: only three points in the money 10% on game stop with something that volatile and especially
3987.32s: with typical call skew, they'll be able to roll them out and up no problem.
3992.80s: For sure.
3993.80s: So I'll show you what that looks like.
4001.72s: And while that things load up.
4005.24s: We'll get a little, we'll get a little tracker built.
4010.36s: We don't need all the options and stuff.
4012.64s: So this will be, um, spot price at entry, spot price to, and then we'll have a strike.
4028.04s: We'll have a delta.
4029.92s: We will have X, we will have premium.
4040.80s: I mean, that's pretty much all we need here.
4046.08s: And then let's do.
4053.44s: We'll do lot size.
4061.72s: So then we'll do value.
4068.80s: And then we'll do P and L. So this is premium to open.
4078.48s: These will be for short calls.
4080.00s: And this will be close premium.
4083.44s: And that's how we'll calculate our P and L.
4091.68s: Cool.
4093.24s: So let's start with taking a look at what these traders might be holding.
4097.00s: I'm just going to move this over and fill it in for now.
4100.28s: So the spot price that they might have entered for the shares.
4104.92s: Let's just guess and we'll guess 25, 25.
4112.00s: And the reason I'm guessing 25, 25 is literally just because that's where the one of the larger
4116.24s: volume nodes exists beyond this 27 handle.
4119.96s: So guessing something like that.
4123.36s: And their entry time would have been, let's say that they got in back here.
4132.88s: So like, well, Feb.
4139.20s: And let's take a look at what those 30 calls are looking like.
4145.12s: So the 23 May and let's say we'll just do a one lot for now because it doesn't matter.
4151.32s: The strike will be the 30s Delta.
4155.60s: Right now is a 44 Delta.
4157.72s: We'll be able to ballpark some stuff in a second.
4160.20s: The 40 trading for like 46.
4168.44s: So let's just take a look regardless of like what their P and L would be all that stuff
4173.80s: at a time.
4174.80s: Let's just take a look at what we could roll these two because that's ultimately what matters.
4179.52s: So if we choose to go out, let's say 29 days and we choose to go out to the 20 June and
4186.12s: we're going to stick with our one lot.
4188.00s: We know that we need to get at least 46 cents.
4190.88s: So we're starting at the 30.
4193.00s: Where can we get 46 cents?
4195.16s: We literally can get it all everywhere, right?
4198.48s: So this is if you made the adjustment on Thursday.
4201.72s: Now we know GameStop traded higher on Friday.
4206.60s: So what we can do is we essentially can make a surrogate guess and GameStop, what did
4212.48s: GameStop close on Friday?
4214.36s: You guys would probably know what like 33 something like that.
4218.48s: So these like this option would essentially look like the 27s.
4225.12s: So these would be trading for 283.
4229.12s: 3303.
4230.28s: Thank you.
4230.80s: Captain Bob.
4232.08s: Super helpful.
4233.72s: So our option really would be trading for like 283.
4241.00s: And the Delta would look something like a 91 Delta.
4244.84s: Quick question.
4246.56s: Does what I just did make sense?
4250.36s: I'm just using a surrogate option to see what our option would generally look like given
4257.24s: a different price point.
4258.32s: That's all that is.
4263.12s: Okay, cool.
4264.60s: It looks like C.Dub is on the same page and as long as C.Dub is on the page, then we
4271.56s: on the page.
4272.76s: Okay.
4274.60s: So now let's go out to the 20 June.
4278.20s: And let's see where we can get $2.83.
4281.24s: We can get it at the 30 for sure.
4284.88s: If we wanted to try to roll up, you would only get $2.33, $2.62.
4292.44s: So you wouldn't get a ton.
4295.08s: Now as you might remember, when you're rolling an option, you don't just have to make
4301.92s: more than this number because you collected a credit on top of this, right?
4307.44s: At some point in the future or at some point in the past.
4311.44s: So your credit might have been like a dollar or something.
4313.92s: I have no idea.
4314.44s: We're just guessing.
4317.28s: So what that means is on this trade itself, you're really only losing $1.83 versus 283.
4328.12s: So the value of this trade is that times your lot size times 100.
4334.44s: And then your P and L on the trade is your opening premium, less your closing.
4342.32s: This is for the calls times lot size times 100.
4346.32s: So you lose an 183 box.
4350.92s: So then if we want to change this and we want to get to a different strike, we really
4355.96s: only need to make this amount of money.
4363.72s: This is on a per lot basis.
4365.56s: We need to get a $1.83.
4367.52s: That's where we would actually hit break even.
4370.76s: So where's that $1.83?
4373.72s: We can get a $1.83 all the way out to like the 33 and a half something like this.
4381.24s: So the point that I'm making is for the traders that had the 30 strike, they're completely
4388.28s: fine.
4389.60s: And it's because there's a ton of choices with respect to management here.
4396.36s: There in no way like caught, stuck, unable to adjust or move that is just not the case
4403.32s: it off for them.
4404.32s: They're completely fine.
4405.84s: So the cool part about something like GameStop is because of how volatile it is, it really
4415.12s: does give you a ton of management choices that otherwise isn't always available, which
4422.48s: really it is a superpower because it's very frequent where that's not inherently the
4428.84s: case.
4430.28s: And it makes managing the trade so much more challenging.
4436.52s: So yeah, I mean, they're completely fine.
4440.12s: Okay, let's see, let's see.
4445.04s: See, dub says is that the VRP, that's what it's called, right?
4458.52s: Are you, I don't remember what we were looking at, sorry.
4461.68s: But VRP, variance or premium is just the difference between implied and realize volatility.
4465.80s: That's all.
4470.76s: Volume is ramping though.
4471.76s: It usually means something's about to happen, right?
4473.68s: So Rudebega is actually following something I talk a lot about and it's actually really,
4480.68s: really important because there are a million different cycle theories.
4485.56s: There's a million different timing theories.
4488.52s: There's just a ton of different theories around GameStop's price behavior.
4495.04s: Now the cool part is as I will always continue to point out to you all, you can literally
4500.96s: always, always.
4503.24s: Identify points to pay attention when you see volume start to meaningfully expand.
4511.08s: Before every significant price move GameStop has ever made, it has had a proceeding expansion
4517.32s: and volume like you're seeing right now that should not be misconstrued to there's significant
4525.16s: volume change, meaning price will go up or that there is absolutely going to be some
4531.72s: sort of big price change that is not what that means at all.
4536.12s: What it does mean is that we absolutely have always seen some sort of change in volume
4545.92s: before we get the price moves, the bigger price moves.
4549.48s: You can literally see that starting here.
4553.04s: So this is the kind of timing where I like to pay attention because we had volume go
4560.68s: from 8.76 to 21.
4566.04s: That's a big, big change in volume.
4572.00s: So does again, does this inherently mean that price is going to rip from here?
4578.92s: Not inherently, but it does mean I mean, price has already started to rip if you look at
4584.36s: it.
4585.36s: I mean, this is 16% in two days to giant move, but does that mean it continues aggressively
4592.52s: that will highly depend on volume.
4598.04s: So the point raised earlier is a really important point to make because now is the absolute
4607.48s: time to pay attention.
4610.20s: Now, this is a really dangerous time as well because there will be people that start
4616.28s: to feel some type of way about missing the boat, quote unquote, and concerned about not
4623.28s: being able to get at a good price.
4626.52s: The difficulty there is that if you look at the frequency of game stop trading up at
4631.92s: these levels, it's not very frequent.
4636.28s: So that doesn't mean that it's going to go up into the mid 30s and then plummet, but
4642.12s: it does mean that like if I were looking to build a position, it doesn't mean that you
4648.36s: can't start looking to build a position now.
4651.44s: It's like completely, completely fine, but I absolutely would not be coming in at size.
4660.36s: So what that means is striking that same balance that I talked to you a lot about with
4665.88s: respect to utilization and allocation.
4670.04s: So if I had $5,000, $10,000, whatever your bankroll is allocated to the game stop position,
4677.32s: I wouldn't use all of that to get in here.
4680.32s: Now again, there's a big difference between how I trade and how other people trade.
4686.20s: This is, I move in between names and it's really important for me to be able to do that
4693.00s: because it's how I capture opportunities.
4695.44s: I fully understand that a lot of other people really just like game stop and a lot of people
4700.72s: really just trade game stop, which is again, that's totally fine.
4705.16s: The main reason I give you that context though is that there is a difference in approach
4708.84s: and that's why the way I'm attacking this is different than most people I think.
4714.68s: So yeah, the volume absolutely something to pay attention to because especially the type
4722.44s: of candles that you're seeing.
4724.76s: I'm not huge into candles stick analysis, but I do believe in using it as an observation
4731.12s: point.
4732.28s: And one of the things that does matter is when you see these big giant one sided candles,
4739.20s: they do tend to follow suit in the same direction to at least some degree until it reverses.
4745.72s: We never know when.
4747.24s: But the reason why that's the case is because it shows a very defined buying behavior and
4753.84s: people clearly are really, really interested at these levels.
4757.60s: Now, one of the concerns I would have is with the cat doing that seemingly aligned on
4764.68s: this timeline.
4767.88s: Meaning the last two days that becomes a little problematic because we don't know if there's
4774.32s: a degree of this that's effectively being propped up by algos.
4780.76s: To refute that point, we've seen previously when the algos have gotten involved with
4785.36s: his tweets, it's really short live.
4787.88s: They move fast.
4789.60s: So this is persistent behavior.
4792.00s: This isn't just algos coming in and out.
4794.96s: There's absolutely a persistent behavior here.
4798.08s: Now it does have options coming up on the sixth options.
4801.32s: It does have earnings coming up on the sixth.
4804.84s: So we'll have to see how it performs around there.
4808.76s: But starting to get like big long here coming into earnings is a little bit tenuous.
4814.32s: Now what we can do is analyze the options chain that includes that earnings release and
4820.96s: see if there's informed money in there and people that might be taking a strong speculative
4829.44s: directional bet because there will be likely some of that.
4834.52s: So the way we do that is by popping over and seeing what the options chain looks like.
4849.24s: Hot nitrogen says playing earnings is always scary.
4852.24s: It shouldn't be scary.
4854.32s: The only reason why it would be scary is if you're trading sizes that make you uncomfortable
4860.08s: and that's bad news.
4862.60s: So earnings we said is on the sixth of June.
4865.80s: Is that correct?
4869.80s: Is that correct?
4874.32s: Six of June is it confirmed yet or are they playing the game?
4877.60s: Let's see what the ball looks like.
4887.32s: 20 June looks a little high.
4892.20s: 20 June looks a little high relative to the expiration cycle that includes earnings supposedly
4901.24s: right now.
4904.80s: Because I see it on the platform flagged is the sixth.
4909.64s: I would expect to see.
4913.64s: Vol around the sixth higher really just in this expiration cycle.
4919.72s: So the fact that ball is higher out here, one thirty and three quarters in 20 June leads
4927.56s: me to believe that there is a chance that the market might think that the release might
4933.26s: be after that.
4935.32s: Because otherwise I would expect this ball to be higher relative to this ball.
4941.64s: So TBD on when earnings actually will land.
4947.16s: But I mean this is for the 20 June primary expiration cycle.
4952.40s: This is huge, absolutely huge.
4956.36s: OI.
4959.16s: And that's very directional.
4961.52s: And this is very proximal to earnings.
4965.44s: Let's see again what this skew looks like.
4974.64s: Huge call premium skew.
4976.60s: Twenty six million.
4978.84s: Twenty six million against one million on the put side.
4982.48s: That's super directional.
4990.84s: Let's take a look at the overall activity for the last couple of weeks.
4996.76s: We already know that the puts have went off.
4999.16s: So I'm going to turn the puts off for now.
5006.24s: Let's get rid of this expiration cycle.
5008.12s: Let's get rid of these strikes.
5012.20s: And let's see what's on the call side.
5016.32s: Yeah.
5018.00s: Yeah.
5019.00s: I mean, these are some absolutely sizable trades.
5027.96s: And these here are really interesting.
5031.56s: Because these like it's a mix of bought in sold.
5035.88s: But like the buys here at the 40s are a 26 delta.
5041.92s: Like that is a directional bet.
5044.64s: That's all that is.
5045.64s: You don't go out here and buy options in this time frame unless it is a directional
5050.88s: bet.
5053.68s: So that looks like a directional bet to me.
5056.00s: And now let's take a look at size really quick.
5060.96s: I'm going to clear out the sale.
5070.84s: And now the size isn't that crazy.
5090.52s: And a lot of these look like rolling positions out a week because a lot of people play
5096.92s: the front in GameStop, which is kind of curious.
5102.12s: But I mean, take a look, right?
5103.76s: So three of those larger trades that we were looking at of these here.
5111.48s: Let's sort of buy premium again.
5113.52s: So if we take a look at the million plus, there's four of them that are on the put side.
5122.36s: And they're all super high delta.
5123.96s: So that's a synthetic stock position.
5127.24s: We have these are short calls.
5130.20s: These look like covered calls because they're pretty far out of the money.
5133.84s: They're at like a 16 delta.
5136.64s: Then we have more of those in the money puts more synthetic shares.
5141.28s: Then we have a directional bet.
5143.44s: This is at the money, one million.
5147.44s: Two more series of short calls.
5151.00s: These are a little more interesting because these are at the money, but these are far out
5155.08s: in time.
5156.80s: So that can be a bunch of different things.
5159.24s: That can be a risk reversal, meaning a synthetic stock position.
5164.32s: It's hard to tell what else is coupled with that.
5167.44s: And then the largest in terms of premium over the last couple of weeks is a directional
5171.28s: bet for the 20th of June using 1.8 mil.
5181.00s: And then in the beginning of May, there was, I remember seeing these, these were really
5192.60s: far out in time, like really, really far out in time.
5197.16s: So these I couldn't really make heads or tails on what it was.
5204.56s: But I also remember that these were like pretty big volume.
5206.56s: Yeah.
5207.56s: Sometimes volume over open interest.
5209.36s: Those were big positions.
5210.36s: And let's take a look over the last two months.
5213.56s: Yeah, those are the big trades.
5216.92s: So most of the big trades here are synthetic stock positions using deep in the money puts.
5221.68s: There's a couple really big trades that were at the money slash in the money on the call
5227.92s: side, but super far out in time, 2027.
5231.32s: And then there's just a few of these near term expiration, 20 June, that's the larger
5241.04s: speculative direction size, which is super interesting.
5245.20s: So overall, it looks like the market has a couple specific themes in mind with respect
5258.68s: to its positioning.
5260.60s: It does look like the 35 handle is nothing crazy for it to be able to move over if it feels
5267.16s: like it.
5268.36s: We can see really persistent bullish option flow from the call side, also from short puts
5274.44s: coming in here.
5275.84s: So these are people also playing ball.
5277.64s: I'm right now I have mostly short puts for the coverage triangle that I'm running in
5281.48s: there.
5282.88s: So that makes this look more bullish to me.
5287.84s: And if we take a look at the actual options chain and the premiums, like we were talking
5295.08s: about before, big, big call skew, big call skew, big call skew, and big call skew, all
5309.12s: of them with respect to call premiums purchase.
5312.48s: So that looks pretty directional expectation to the upside to me.
5318.96s: That's broadly what I'm seeing here.
5321.80s: What questions do you have?
5322.80s: What should we look at?
5324.88s: Anything in here that you want to double click into, let me know.
5328.68s: I'm going to go through the last couple news pieces really fast out of curiosity.
5335.64s: I do think this is a big part of it with the Bitcoin, with the Bitcoin momentum.
5344.84s: I definitely think that.
5349.88s: The problem is is that their Bitcoin position still like, what does that reflect?
5354.56s: What does their Bitcoin position reflect as part of their balance sheet?
5358.52s: What does game stops Bitcoin position reflect relative to the balance sheet?
5378.60s: Let us see.
5385.84s: $1.4 billion, $4.7 billion cash, $25 March, they're going to add Bitcoin $1.5 billion through
5403.60s: senior notes.
5407.36s: So $6.25 billion in cash and securities, $1.48 billion from the notes.
5433.04s: So if it invested $1.48 billion with Bitcoin around $70, it would hold $21,142 Bitcoin worth
5441.24s: $2.36 billion at $110 Bitcoin on $22 May, which is about $880 million unrealized gains.
5452.52s: So let's do it before all the gains in shit.
5456.80s: So $1.48 billion divided by $6.25 billion.
5463.40s: So it's like 24%.
5464.40s: Well, that's a lie because they raised the debt.
5469.44s: That was stupid math.
5471.48s: It was 24% relative to the cash, but they raised $1.5 billion.
5476.96s: So that's $6.25 plus $1.5.
5484.00s: So $7.75.
5486.28s: So then $1.48 divided by $7.75.
5489.32s: 19%, just shy of 20%.
5492.72s: That's still a significant amount of the company.
5495.72s: So it looks like, I mean, the company is without a doubt going to have sensitivity to Bitcoin
5504.24s: movements with 20% of the balance sheet in it.
5509.76s: And that's a conservative number.
5511.04s: We don't know exactly where that will land.
5515.44s: So yeah, this will, I imagine you'll start to see not purely like a super strong correlation,
5521.96s: but I do think you'll start to see more of a correlation emerge with respect to Bitcoin.
5530.24s: Sunny says, did you talk about the deep in the money puts yet?
5532.64s: I did.
5533.64s: I also talked about them in a standalone video.
5535.68s: So if you have any questions on it, let me know.
5537.84s: To me, it just looks like synthetic stock.
5544.96s: That's mostly what I'm seeing.
5551.72s: Mashain says, if you were trying to build a large position, but didn't want to move the
5555.08s: price, would you use short puts?
5559.96s: Well, what do you mean?
5560.96s: I would need way more context than that because the option trade is going to look a lot different
5576.20s: than if you hold the equity.
5578.64s: So that wouldn't be the, that wouldn't be the main thing that I would be worried about
5583.20s: AKA trying to build a larger position and not move the price.
5587.88s: So I would need to know the context on why that would be the goal.
5592.76s: And then that would inform whether or not like in the money short put position would, would
5599.64s: correspondingly make sense.
5603.20s: So it's a little tricky.
5611.32s: Dave Swag says, how does that impact the current price action market makers needing to keep
5616.32s: those shares on hand?
5617.32s: No, they don't, they're not worried about that.
5620.16s: Can you talk about the market plumbing behind starting a position like that?
5623.48s: Who would use the strategy?
5624.48s: How often?
5625.48s: I mean, it's not really that crazy.
5627.92s: It's just a synthetic stock position.
5629.52s: You can build them a bunch of different ways.
5631.20s: It's mostly done by institutions and it's for a bunch of different reasons.
5635.56s: Part of it is because it might complement the way that the rest of the portfolio looks.
5640.40s: Part of it might be because you're not super confident that the underlying is going to
5644.12s: have some sort of massive upside move.
5646.60s: So you want to collect a little bit of theta because even if you go super far out in time
5650.72s: on deep in the money puts, there's still extrinsic value that you still will collect.
5655.16s: So it also might complement the broader portfolio a little bit better.
5660.96s: There's a capital efficiency side of things versus buying it outright.
5665.60s: So there can be a bunch of different reasons behind doing it.
5669.64s: But one of the things is the market maker doesn't need to keep anything on hand for the
5674.36s: short puts because remember, if you're short put, what does that mean with respect to your
5679.24s: relationship with the stock?
5681.64s: It means that you are on the hook to buy the stock.
5686.24s: So if you're a short put, you can't exercise.
5690.20s: Only the counterparty can exercise.
5692.52s: So the market maker wouldn't have to worry about the short put at all.
5697.04s: They're indifferent to them.
5699.08s: Now it's completely different for being short a call that can be exercised.
5705.80s: That's a whole other bag.
5712.08s: So yeah, I don't really think it's a ton.
5721.04s: I don't think it's like a ton of like any overly complicated positioning.
5726.32s: You can look across most underlines and see part effects of those kinds of positions
5732.24s: and the options chain.
5734.64s: So yeah.
5739.40s: Let me get caught up.
5742.80s: Rudy Baker says the thing is I already own Bitcoin.
5745.08s: So I'm overexposed to it now.
5746.68s: That actually is it.
5748.12s: That's good for you to identify that because that's a tricky thing that people are dealing
5753.00s: with right now.
5754.16s: It's one of the things when you're adding stuff to the portfolio, you typically are
5757.28s: trying to build a portfolio that reflects your views and what you want.
5761.52s: And you have to look at things in total.
5764.88s: So I think you're analyzing GameStop and their potential Bitcoin holdings effectively.
5772.52s: Because you're right.
5774.00s: If you don't want to have overexposure depending on what your preferences are, then you might
5779.56s: have to start looking at adjusting what your Bitcoin exposure is so that it reflects
5784.76s: the correct amount of your portfolio.
5787.16s: Because again, even if we're using the general estimate of anywhere between 10 and 20%, that's
5793.48s: a lot to hold in something as volatile as Bitcoin.
5797.92s: Because just as it's going up now, which is great, it also does go down, which makes
5803.52s: it difficult when that's eroding value on the balance sheet that you might need.
5809.52s: At a point in time.
5810.52s: So my guess is they're probably viewing it as more of a strategic investment longer term.
5814.96s: Because that I think makes sense.
5816.44s: Bitcoin is well positioned, I think, to continue growing.
5820.80s: Like, I think overall.
5823.24s: Royne Clity says, was there a change semi-recently that allows companies to show crypto gains as
5830.64s: profit?
5831.64s: I don't know.
5833.56s: I don't know anything about that.
5834.80s: But I mean, you still would report it on the balance sheet, right?
5838.16s: Like if you're holding it, you still have to represent what your assets are.
5843.08s: So you'll absolutely be able to track what the quarter-over-quarter is in that asset value.
5851.08s: Because it matters.
5852.08s: It's part of the valuation of the company.
5854.72s: So yeah.
5855.80s: Well, Steve says, equity could be shares.
5861.92s: This could be a plan from DFV's end.
5866.00s: Equity could be shares.
5868.92s: I don't follow.
5871.44s: That confuses me.
5874.08s: Mr. Rover says, what if those puts were bought to open instead of the market and the market
5879.32s: maker had to be short those deep in the money puts and then hedged by short in the underlying?
5883.96s: A few things.
5886.04s: We don't know with certainty whether they're bought or sold, but it's unbelievably likely that
5899.32s: they were sold based on what we can see.
5905.44s: Now if somebody did choose to buy them, the market maker doesn't really have to worry about
5912.76s: hedging for some time.
5915.48s: The reason is because early exercise doesn't make sense financially unless there's certain
5924.32s: edge circumstances where it does.
5927.16s: So you wouldn't buy those options and then exercise.
5931.92s: So there's very little risk of assignment risk.
5936.56s: And the other thing is if somebody did exercise those, it would be absolute gift to whoever's
5945.00s: on the other side of it.
5946.96s: Because if you exercise those puts, then you can essentially get out at a much better
5954.60s: rate using spot price.
5957.44s: So it literally wouldn't, literally wouldn't matter at all.
5965.24s: The time that it actually, because right, I don't know, there's what it, there's what
5971.96s: I just said makes sense.
5972.96s: If you have questions on this shit, let me know because I just, I don't know this.
5976.68s: I'm still used to talking about this stuff that it's all like very native to me.
5980.40s: And sometimes I'm ignorant in understanding where like somebody else might be with what
5984.84s: I'm talking about.
5986.60s: So always if I'm saying some shit that you don't understand, please tell me so that I can
5991.12s: explain it.
5992.52s: But I just wouldn't make sense for the early exercise.
5997.04s: So I think that that scenario is not fully impossible, but it's unbelievably improbable.
6008.24s: And all the evidence points to the kind of a different scenario.
6015.40s: Captain Bob says, what if the US government with the US government looking to buy Bitcoin?
6021.88s: Do you think that the investment more into Bitcoin would be more beneficial than say
6027.76s: S&P?
6032.56s: I don't think it's a bad thesis, but I would struggle to say whether or not it's better than
6044.16s: S&P.
6045.56s: And it's because of a lot of different reasons, but the broad value of Bitcoin still hasn't
6053.88s: stabilized.
6055.76s: And if it's ever going to behave like a currency, it can't continue appreciating forever.
6061.08s: It's going to have to stabilize.
6063.44s: Otherwise it will absolutely never operate as a currency.
6070.44s: And that's a big part of the value proposition for it.
6075.12s: So I think there's nothing wrong with holding it.
6080.20s: And I mean, I hold Bitcoin.
6081.56s: I think it's an interesting thing.
6083.00s: And I think that it's a good speculative investment.
6086.80s: But I do think that the like equities have a place in a portfolio for a reason.
6094.60s: And it's for a bunch of different reasons, but they provide different use cases, in my
6100.96s: opinion.
6102.96s: Mateo says, well, I believe the premise of Bitcoin scarcity is allies.
6107.08s: Bitcoin is practically divisible in millions of Satoshi's.
6111.96s: So in terms of liquidity, it will never be scarce.
6115.20s: Its price goes up by cybercrime.
6117.40s: I think it's going to act more like digital gold.
6120.00s: Ruta Bagan says I think it's going to act more like digital gold.
6123.04s: Yeah, and I mean, it eventually might.
6125.84s: The problem is is the reason why gold is worth what it is is because it has intrinsic value.
6133.80s: Something like Bitcoin doesn't necessarily have intrinsic value.
6139.04s: Now you can argue that the modality of intrinsic value has changed a lot.
6144.56s: And intrinsic value can include non physical applications, right?
6149.56s: So like actual privacy of transactions and stuff like that.
6152.40s: So I personally wouldn't argue that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value.
6156.80s: I would just say it's a different kind of intrinsic value than a physical commodity.
6161.24s: But that stuff aside, the main thing that Bitcoin will eventually have to do is stabilize
6172.96s: in order for it to like truly be widely adopted, right?
6176.64s: Like we're talking about right now, game stop holding essentially 10%, just 10% of its
6184.20s: balance sheet in Bitcoin and how wild the swings can be on that alone.
6192.00s: So because of that kind of thing, it does force you to consider like for larger institutions,
6199.20s: where's the right place to put your assets?
6201.92s: And it's probably not going to be a significant amount of your assets and something that is
6207.92s: effectively schizophrenic.
6209.96s: Now I do think a lot of them will speculate in it, but a speculative position is completely
6215.04s: different than like something that you're trying to base adoption off of.
6219.76s: Because I mean, literally just look at it.
6225.64s: It's absolutely insane.
6229.96s: The kind of moves that Bitcoin has had even in the last three years.
6234.96s: So yeah, I find Bitcoin really interesting because I do think it has a long term value
6246.78s: proposition.
6248.44s: But I think the adoption of the value proposition is the tricky part.
6258.04s: Lauren says I don't understand the difference between Bitcoin and corn.
6263.00s: Nobody ever actually owns corn or gold.
6266.04s: How is Bitcoin different?
6268.04s: I don't naturally understand what you mean by that.
6273.12s: Because people like do physically purchase corn and Bitcoin.
6282.28s: And a big difference is corn is used in a lot of physical processes.
6289.48s: So if I'm to make sake, oh no, that's rice.
6294.44s: If I'm to make whatever that uses corn tortilla chips, I need corn in order to make them.
6302.80s: I need physical corn.
6305.04s: There's nothing that I need Bitcoin to do.
6309.44s: Same thing with gold.
6310.64s: There's manufacturing processes and things that basically need gold in order to complete
6319.00s: whatever the production is of those items other than just wearing it around your neck.
6325.96s: I need gold for those.
6328.24s: And again, like, I don't need Bitcoin for any of those.
6332.76s: Yet, I will say yet.
6337.76s: Lauren says in the market, people aren't buying physical corn.
6341.76s: Ah, that's different.
6344.64s: That's different.
6345.64s: So when you're talking in the market context of like corn futures, people are not buying
6352.04s: physical corn futures.
6353.88s: The retail trading side of things here are actually people that are speculating simply
6359.32s: on the price of corn.
6361.52s: However, the primary users of coin futures are people like farmers that produce corn that
6370.20s: are using the futures contract to stabilize their price profile.
6374.96s: That's the entire point of futures.
6377.72s: Now they allow speculators in because who doesn't want to allow some degenerates in to start
6382.52s: throwing their money away?
6384.00s: It, I mean, functionally does provide liquidity and stuff like that.
6387.84s: But the main users of coin futures are people who have exposure to the price of coin.
6395.60s: Corn.
6396.60s: They use it literally to stabilize price.
6399.76s: It's like the same thing that you see with planes in the price of jet fuel.
6406.44s: The margins for airlines is really, really sensitive to the price of jet fuel.
6412.48s: So if for whatever reason there's a big conflict in jet fuel starts to get super expensive
6417.20s: or whatever the case is, that can absolutely murder the margins for jets because their margins
6423.64s: aren't fantastic.
6425.36s: So they use things like futures to hedge that risk so that if it does happen, meanwhile
6432.52s: they would be losing, quote, unquote, at the pump, they're making it back on the hedge.
6438.12s: So that's really the main use of futures on the marketplace is actually for people that
6443.40s: have some sort of supply chain sensitivity to whatever that commodity, whatever that instrument
6448.84s: is.
6449.84s: People use it for currencies.
6451.24s: If I'm doing a deal with another country and it's predicated on a deal that's going
6457.28s: to happen six months from now based on a price agreed to today, I have currency risk.
6462.80s: I can hedge that currency risk today so that I can make the money on the deal.
6466.88s: I'm not trying to make money on the hedge.
6468.56s: I'm just trying to decrease my risk in the currency so that I can make the money from
6473.28s: the deal and not lose the money from the relationship between the currency over that
6476.88s: duration.
6478.56s: So yeah, that's why those are completely different than something like Bitcoin.
6484.12s: The overall use for futures on the open market is completely different.
6489.92s: All right, gang, it is time for me to bounce super fun conversation though.
6497.36s: Absolutely had a blast hanging out with everybody.
6500.08s: As always, I am around.
6501.76s: You can find me in the discord.
6503.60s: It's completely free to join.
6504.68s: You have to go through the Patreon page now.
6506.80s: So you go sign up there.
6508.36s: It's for free.
6509.36s: And then you can still pop over and come hang out if you'd like.
6512.20s: Otherwise, I will see you all next weekend on the next meme stock watch stream being out
6518.72s: there.
6519.72s: See you guys later.
