0.00s: What's up, outliers? Quick market update, bit of a day out there. We don't have a live
5.16s: stream today. We're running a new cadence. The live streams will be Tuesday and Thursday.
9.94s: So we'll run a couple of these market updates in the meantime to tie this over. So what
14.44s: happened today? Pretty big market reversal. The market was down a pretty solid portion
21.74s: of the day and then towards the tail. And it started to rotate back over. So we take
26.88s: a look at futures here. This is just the micro Eminis. You can see that through most
34.32s: of last week started off down, open up today, 13th. And we opened up really soft and we
41.48s: were rolling down through this. And then we got bid back up. That was very curious to
48.72s: me. So if we grab SPX instead, which will have a little bit more follow through, you'll
54.22s: notice the size of the candles here is very different issues because there's more transactions
58.18s: going on in here in the index itself via options and whatnot. So I mean, this is still
64.10s: objectively a lower low, even though it didn't fall out of bed here. I don't think we're
68.90s: out of the woods. This still looks like the level to be beat the downside. And I think
75.70s: if we continue to see this downward pressure, because it wasn't a great follow through
79.58s: day to the upside, it barely crossed above the close from Friday. So this is still rolling
85.62s: over. And it's developing a channel to the downside, right? So we've seen successive,
92.82s: lower highs, successive, lower lows, except for this one. But now this one adding in starts
97.42s: to build that out. So it's kind of anybody's guess at this point. And that's the cool part
104.38s: about trading is we don't really have to know. We just have to follow what it's doing
108.10s: and move along with it as best we can. So volatility contracted quite a lot. It opened
113.74s: up heavy today up over 20, the 20 handle. And it fell down below 19. Now this is typically
120.86s: a great spot to start considering if you trade volatility, some trades in here, you can
126.26s: either trade it the non-traditional way. I guess you could say in cell puts, the reason
132.86s: why you might sell puts into something like this is because the volatility will be very
136.54s: high. And then you might get out even as it contracts towards the puts slightly unscathed
142.30s: because of IV contracting. And then you kind of protect your wrist to the downside a little
145.66s: bit. You could always do long puts, going to be really expensive. You're not going to
150.30s: make a whole lot on an unrelative basis, but directionally it tends to work again. Because
153.98s: you can see over the last six months, we don't get many runs up above 20. And when we do
160.06s: see runs up above 20, they're not that long in duration. Even if we go all the way back
165.66s: to the drop that we saw in August of last year, you can see that we were above 20 here.
169.26s: One, two, three, four, five, six days. And then on the seventh, he rest, and I'm just
175.02s: kidding, on the seventh, VIX rest that apparently in drop below 20 for a little bit. So that's
180.38s: a typically simple trade. It's not like you're going to make a bunch of money on it because
183.78s: everybody knows it, but it still is at least something to pay attention to. Looking across
189.82s: the broader market though, let's grab the indices first. And actually, let's grab the overall
197.50s: market. And we can see a few things I want to run through a couple positions in a second that
202.94s: I updated in TEE Triple Qs. And in Upro, the coverage strangles because today was the data
208.70s: start making some adjustments to those. And I want to keep you up to speed with what's going on.
212.30s: But across the sectors, we saw materials is starting to base out here. Right? So it
219.58s: actually had a pretty strong day on the day. And it's posting a channel, not a channel, sorry,
225.18s: it's posting local lows, meaning it's not falling, it's not continuing, it's starting to consolidate.
231.10s: So it's turning into a consolidation trend. Whereas comm services is still decelerating, it
237.58s: bit up slightly today, but not much. And then energy is still continuing. It's run. Energy is
242.70s: likely to continue to look good during this kind of market condition. Then we have financials about
248.86s: the same recovery, but none too strong. And it's still assuming this down trend as far as we can
255.74s: see now, industrials, this is consolidating and potentially starting a trend reversal, a little
261.50s: early to tell tech fell out of bed. Right? So even though it had an okay update, it's still
266.62s: gaped down, which is a pretty big move. I know because of, you know, the triple Qs.
272.78s: Staples lows, new lows. This has been an easy, easy trade to continue to follow. We've talked
278.46s: about this for literally months now, like at least two months. We've been talking about staples.
284.70s: And it continues to show weakness. Real estate again, maybe slightly consolidating, but it's still
290.86s: too really to tell if that's local lows or if it's just an update that's likely to continue. Utilities,
297.10s: down day, it's not looking healthy. Healthcare is again, rallying a little bit. It's kind of the
305.58s: stronger, I guess you could say between energy and healthcare, but neither one of them look great.
310.46s: And then discretionary is still down trending. So for those that are wondering, this is defense.
318.54s: And defense is consolidating for some time now. So across the market, breath doesn't look super
326.06s: great. Now we did see that turnaround today. So it led to more names advancing than I would have
331.82s: expected. And we can see the change in the five day and one month, advanced,
336.06s: there's decliners for the total market components. So the market is still rotating over. That's what
343.18s: this tells me. It's too early to call it heads or tails in either way, but I do think having some
349.74s: sort of long inverse deltas is probably not off the table. So when I say long inverse deltas,
357.50s: it's essentially beta weighted deltas that are negative that were long. And the reason why I say
362.14s: long is just because it controls risk a little bit more than being overall short options into that.
368.46s: So the easier way to think of it is just being short beta weighted deltas, but using some sort of
374.22s: long premium strategy. That is essentially what we're seeing across the market today. Now from an
381.58s: economics perspective, we had a few things come out that were absolutely important. So CPI
387.74s: came in light. It was expected at 5.3 came in at 5.22, which is not actually super great. Inflation
396.22s: expectations came in pretty close to expectations. And then CPI, we have to take a look at year-to-year
403.66s: and month-over-month. So we'll jump on that in a second. But first, I just want to pop over
409.74s: and see from a broad market perspective what news is being highlighted here.
416.78s: So this is through bar chart just coming through and seeing what they're flagging.
422.14s: Nasdaq down, we know, crude oil. Yeah, there's a relationship, but that's been a little bit weaker.
430.62s: So this is definitely a big, big, big focus right now is CPI coming out Wednesday. We can see from
437.74s: a fed rate perspective, there's been really no change in the expectation of no change.
444.30s: So there's not a lot changing here. The use the word three times on a row, but there really isn't.
450.86s: Right? So if we look at a day ago, it was 96.8% chance of no change, not 97.3. So the market's not
457.50s: expecting a change in 29 March or 29 Jan. If we look in 19 March, it's still a higher probability of
464.54s: no change. And then if we look at 7 May, it's still highest probability of no change. And then if we
469.82s: go all the way out to 18 June, that's when we get a slight edge on a potential ease. So one of the
476.62s: things I really like to do is track this because you can see that near term changes and expectations
482.86s: happening real time in other levels of expectation. So you can see from the ninth of Jan, specifically
491.82s: looking at the blue line that I'm hovering on for the federal fund rate to be targeted at four
496.14s: and a quarter to four and a half, it's at 27% and then it jumps to 44. So there's still again,
503.98s: like a lot of changing underlying expectations and what this might look like, but it's all centered
511.42s: around very little overall impact likely to happen here. All right. So let's take a look now at
517.82s: a couple of changes that we had today in the leveraged coverage triangle portfolio.
522.38s: So today we're going to talk about TQs and Upro. And you can see I'm still very light in both
528.22s: of these. We actually took some risk off today in the sense of when we were rolling some in the
533.66s: money short puts, we got much better strikes, which decreases the total amount of cash secured
538.30s: requirement for the position. So then the ends up decreasing our utilization even though the
542.86s: position size you'll notice will be the same to summarize what I just said. I didn't change any
548.14s: of the lot sizes, but because the strikes did change the overall amount of money I need to cash
554.38s: secure it decreased, which decreases the total utilization thus the percent utilization. This is
562.70s: tactical move at this point because I don't really care for what the market is sitting at right
569.82s: now. Again, I don't think it's end of days, anything like that, but this isn't where I want to be
574.46s: overexposed, which is why I'm so light on these two sub 50% and I will stay this way as long as I
580.86s: need to. The other thing that you'll notice it's not, sorry, it's not on this one. It's on another
585.98s: one that I track that will monitor the notional exposure. But remember TQs and Upro, there are
592.86s: essentially both three times the underlying itself. So this is essentially behaving as $300,000
597.66s: of spy and then this is essentially behaving as 120 HK of TQs. So it's already levered. That's why
604.38s: I don't need to add too much risk here. It's one of the benefits of trading the strategy. Okay,
608.62s: so what changed today? Well, pretty easy stuff in TQs don't have a lot out, but I did have this
615.50s: position and it was expiring this coming Friday. I had the 82s, the 82 puts and these were already
622.86s: rolled once. So you can see I took those down. This was I think a little while ago if I'm not mistaken
631.74s: that I originally adjusted this role and I flattened out. This was the call side, sorry. I had
637.90s: flattened out the call side and then the main adjustments came on the put side because here's what
644.06s: happened. I originally just took in these 83s for a small bit of profit to reposition and break out
650.78s: the lots to be in a couple different explorations. And this was also just taking some of the risk
655.02s: down. I talked about that. So then the primary adjustment today was in this trade where we were almost
662.22s: on to expiration. I had the 83 puts that were expiring 17 Jan. They were originally a 30 delta.
668.14s: I took them down. Obviously they were in the money by a bit. They're like a 70 delta. It took
672.22s: those in for 825. And then I offered this tranche here for 850. So I didn't change size,
679.74s: but I did improve my basis by three points. There's a reason why that matters. If you take a look at
686.38s: this down here, I just updated the information with the trade so you can see what happened. And
692.14s: essentially I've taken the basis adjustment down by 3.6%. I've reduced the cash secured requirement
699.26s: for the trade by 600 bucks. Not much, but again on something that's only 44k allocated. It's not a
704.54s: trivial amount of money. And really we need this to be trading. We need this option right here.
711.50s: To be trading at 281 before we hit our break even where we could prospectively close this trade
717.66s: and then move on with profit without taking it all the way to expiration. Again, this is why
724.62s: understanding rolling options is so important. I have a video, a link to that in the notes below that
728.94s: talks about it because this number matters a lot. You don't have to take this all the way to expiration
732.86s: and I don't intend to. Cool. So now let's take a look at you, pro. You pro was a little bit of the same.
741.02s: So we can see that there is actually two tranches that got adjusted today, a six lot and a three lot.
746.54s: And then also the short call side of things will start with a short call. It's easier. From the short
750.86s: call side of things, I literally just took them down. I had the 102s that were a 30 delta 21 Feb
757.66s: took them in for 40 cents. So that gave me 145 bucks. And then I offered one more. So same lot size,
767.18s: same expiration, but I just took them in further to the 95s, which were 22 delta, the 95 is still
771.74s: above my basis by just a little bit, but this allows me to increase my total premium without adding
776.78s: size on the call side of things. I still have 100 shares that are uncapped too early to cap those.
782.22s: And then on the put side, we did have to play some games. So on the put side of things, this is
789.98s: what came down today. I had the 90s out both for 17 Jan the 90s and the 88s. I sold them for 180,
798.70s: 165 respectively. And then I took them in for 564 10 respectively. So you can see that that
804.62s: brings the realized PNL on the put side of things to negative 2802. This is again, why rolling
811.74s: options is important to pay attention to because this, even though it shows negative,
815.98s: they do have enough to overcome that loss. However, this is realized. This is unrealized. These
822.78s: trades are open. They can turn against me even more or seem to make even more adjustment.
828.38s: But what I ended up doing was taking the 90s to 86s and then the 88s to 85s. They're both in
835.74s: 21 Feb. They're 50 delta 46 delta. So I was actually able to put these out essentially right at
841.58s: the money, which is great. It's a great basis adjustment because these were both in the money
845.82s: at the time of adjusting. So had a really healthy move on the overall basis. So again,
852.94s: showing you those metrics down here on the six lot, we were able to reduce our basis by 4.4%
859.50s: and then we reduced total cash secured requirement by 2400 bucks. Every time this happens,
864.46s: we're reducing total risk, which is good. And then on the three lot, we reduced that by 3.4%.
870.38s: Again, took down $900 of risk. So now we're just hanging out. This is where both of these sit
876.86s: today. Now from an analysis perspective, I'm going to conduct the analysis on the underlying
881.42s: self-meaning spy versus you pro just because this is the dominant index that it's based off of.
888.30s: And I already explained most of my thoughts here where I still expect more downside potential
894.86s: based on the broader trend that we're seeing here. And as long as this trend remains like this,
901.10s: I'm going to remain defensive in my positioning. So if we take a look at drawing like a basic trendline
907.34s: here and then another trendline really kind of starts from here ish.
914.30s: But we're very clearly in a negative trend on these. This price level is really important
920.62s: and we'll see how it behaves if it gets a rally, if it does rally, it doesn't start approaching this.
925.98s: But with no rate cuts coming up and earnings coming up, unless earnings are smash out,
931.58s: everything looks good. This just generally looks like more room to the downside. And
936.86s: Q's is even worse because Q's is in a clearly defined downtrend at this point.
944.22s: And it has the broader, this isn't clicking for some reason. There we go.
948.94s: Has the broader descending channel to show it. And this is already below this support. So
955.10s: not only does that not bode well for Q's, but that doesn't bode well for the broader market because
959.74s: tech has been such a massive element, dropping things up futures are up right now. So it's a little
966.22s: early to tell. We'll take a dive into this stuff later today during the live stream, but wanted to
971.50s: give you a quick recap on what I saw some trade adjustments as always. If there's anything you want
975.74s: me to take a look at a stock, you want to analyze together, let me know. We can take care of that.
980.06s: You know, I'll see you later.
