0.00s: Boom, we're back. What's up, outliers? Today we're talking about GameStop because we have
5.10s: some pretty exciting news as I imagine most have seen already, which is this right here.
12.34s: So the at the market equity offer is now complete. This is as of today, 23 September, and
20.02s: we can see exactly what happened here. It says it filed a prospectus supplement with
26.90s: the SEC to offer to sell up to a maximum of 20 million shares for the at the market offering.
36.38s: And it says the aggregate gross proceeds are approximately 400 million. So what's going
43.70s: on here? Take a look at this. GameStop intends to use the net proceeds from the ATM program
51.82s: for general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions and investments. I think
57.78s: this is mostly what we've been expecting to see in here. And I know that this isn't necessarily
64.06s: earth shattering this line here, but they also didn't have to include this. And the fact
69.14s: that they did, I think that's important to know because it's telling us pretty clearly
73.98s: that they're starting to message. There's something going on with this money as we know,
79.10s: for a company to just raise money to just have money in the bank, it doesn't actually
84.26s: make sense. And this is something that we've talked about before because a lot of people
88.18s: will say like, oh, they're just earning really good interest on the cash that's sitting
91.30s: there. Interest is fine on large sums of money. But again, it's a drop in the bucket compared
96.38s: to a business doing what a business does, which is sales revenue. It's going to way better
102.74s: than 5% that they're going to get on their money. So they're not just applying like a
107.34s: standard individual trader or investor mindset of, let me just get a good yield. And then
113.58s: that'll be good enough. That's obviously not the case at all. They're going to do something
117.10s: with this money. It's the only reason why you raise it now. What that is, we don't know
121.58s: still, but I actually really, really like that they include this because this also builds off
127.74s: of what we recently saw back in August, where they filed this 8K that essentially saw them
136.06s: cutting ties with creditors. So this starts to unlock their ability to do things like M&A
142.70s: investments, depending on, you know, what warm this all takes. It enables them to do that
147.82s: unencumbered. They don't owe anybody anything. They're able to move autonomously. So what
154.14s: I'm seeing here is a breadcrumb trail. And it's starting to piece together. Now what it turns
160.78s: into again, I have no idea. I'm very eager to find out. Also, still nobody has told me what
166.86s: this is up here. I like some video games. I'm not like a huge gamer. And I don't know what this
171.42s: is. Is this just like a fantasy drawing or is this actually from like a video gamer something?
175.34s: And if so, please tell me which one because every time I see it, it's on a bunch of these. I
179.18s: just don't know what it is. Also, everybody listening to this with earphones on you,
184.30s: omia, huge favor that I have cat like reflexes because I just caught myself in the biggest sneeze
189.34s: on planet earth and was able to pause the recording fast enough so I didn't blow out all of your
193.82s: eardrums, which I'm pretty sure it would have. Okay, so recap. ATM done 20 million shares out 400
202.06s: mill in the bank. We have this that I need to know what this is. Nobody's helping with that yet.
207.90s: And we are now looking forward to the rest of this puzzle to come together in terms of what kind
213.26s: of acquisitions or investments this could look like. So from my perspective, just really exciting
221.82s: stuff. And the reason why it's so exciting is because there's opportunities. There's so many
225.58s: opportunities that are available here. We've seen everything from getting deeper into collectibles.
231.02s: We've been seeing conversations about moving further into the peripheral lines. I've been seeing
235.42s: conversations about starting to acquire either synergistic companies or completely different style
241.34s: companies and nobody knows. That's kind of the fun part. Now, my guess is GameStop and Ryan Cohen
247.42s: probably has a decent idea of where they're trying to take things at this point. I do not think
251.66s: that they're just like, oh, let's just keep raising money and then we'll see what happens. I
254.86s: don't fully see that as the case. I'm not saying that they have something lined out discreetly.
260.94s: But my guess is they have some ideas on where they want to go with this because that's the other
264.46s: thing is with how much money they have in the bank to add 400 million dollars is actually really
270.22s: interesting to me. That's a strategic move. I don't know why they pick that. But it's not
275.02s: happenstance. They're not just like, ah, you know, this will be fun to have another 400 million in
279.26s: the bank. I don't think it's that. So what this actually is, I don't know yet. But to me,
285.90s: this looks like a series of strategic movements that are leading them towards something to do with
290.78s: this. Now, how does this translate to stock price movement really, really well? Because as you
296.46s: can see, after earnings, we came down massively big spike in volume. And then we can see that daily
303.74s: volume leading into the last couple days. I see nine and a half mill, eight mill, five point nine,
309.98s: six point three, 10 point seven, eight point nine, 61 point nine. So obviously on the 20th, and this
319.42s: is we reviewed these orders already. There were massive dark pool orders that came through on the 20th.
325.90s: And that doesn't surprise me. And we can see that we kind of cleaned up today.
330.14s: Overall volume today was still 13.7 million. That's high compared to the relative averages. So
337.34s: the beautiful part about this is look at the price movement here. This is an again example of
345.34s: as soon as overall pressure starts to be relieved, GameStop starts to rally. Look at these days.
353.18s: Post earnings really ugly didn't look good, didn't like earnings. We had a bit of a trail
357.82s: down and then we just have a couple massive spikes following through, which is really, really
363.50s: cool to see. So now a couple other general technical notes. I do see RSI sloping above its moving
371.74s: average. And I see both of those trending above the 50 handle on again, the RSI. So that's just
378.78s: generally money moving in, which again, you don't need that to see that that's what's starting to
382.86s: happen here. There's a lot of buy volume that's driving this kind of price movement. Now if we take a
387.34s: look at the options flow and let's take a look at options flow specifically for today.
397.10s: And I'm looking at the call side options that have been bought relatively quiet. There's nothing
403.26s: that I would consider overly remarkable here. If I throw on the bid to see what's been sold,
408.94s: a couple more larger trades, but still not a lot of remarkable movement, at least for today alone.
416.06s: Again, I continue to remind you guys, I don't come in here and try to spin everything I see as
420.62s: the most crazy thing on planet earth. I'm a trader. What I try to do is objectively analyze
425.82s: information. And again, right now that's information I see here. It's relatively quiet. It's
429.98s: nothing too crazy. Now let's take a look at GameStop on the dark pool side of things because I know
435.18s: that this will look a little bit different. And we can see today that if I sort this not by time,
443.58s: but if I sort this by size, we've had a handful of really large trades come through. So we're seeing
450.70s: you know, things several 10,000s, right? So 74,000, 19,000, 20,000. So a bunch of those still,
457.58s: that's about the same. But here's the thing that we have to look at as per usual is if we look
463.18s: in filter by 5,000, there was a bunch of 5,000 blocks again today. So if we take a look at the 20th
471.74s: in isolation, a bunch of these 5,000 blocks. And again, I have to actually add more so that you can
478.14s: see all of them. And this is now going back from the 20th. So now let's take a look at essentially
486.94s: the last week, including today. And we can see that what I like tracking is what's the relationship
495.66s: of these blocks and how are they coming in? So like the 23rd, we can see that there's a bunch of
501.42s: them. On the 20th, we can see that there's a ton of them, literally a ton of them. That's all
505.42s: me scrolling through the 20th. Then I can see on the 18th, a few 17th, a few 16th, less. So I can look
512.22s: and see what's the flow of these 5,000 block orders. And again, it just is interesting to follow along.
517.90s: And I want to keep an eye if they continue after this next order flow is done. Now that GameStop
524.86s: announced it's complete. I wonder if that's going to have any impact on these 5,000 blocks that we see.
530.14s: I don't know yet. Now the last thing I want to take a look at with you quickly
535.34s: are the options chains, as you know. So if we jump in here, there's a couple things that jumped
540.78s: out at me. The first thing is that volume today was super heavy call side. 173,000 calls against 38,000
548.06s: puts massive calls skew. Most of that transacted at the offer or above, meaning these are people buying
555.02s: calls. So still generally bullish configuration. But the open interest is most interesting to me.
560.22s: Because we can see that the open interest didn't contract that much. That means people from
564.06s: last expiration, because there was over 100,000 options that should have expired. Well did
569.02s: expire Friday that were rolled out into this week and with new positions established. But
574.86s: this is the most interesting thing to me so far. Take a look at where all these big positions are.
581.90s: This is the first time truly that I see the front expiration cycle being way less dense than the
590.14s: front, the next expiration cycle, the next expiration cycle after that until you get to the next
595.18s: primary expiration cycle, the 18 oct. And if you take a look at these, kind of these white
601.82s: rectangles, those are all 18 oct. Those are several weeks out. But that's where most of the
607.98s: li is right now. That's very cool because that's sticky open interest. That's not going to come down
614.14s: every single week with people having a bunch of options expiring worthless. So if we take a look
619.90s: at this front expiration cycle, there's 103,000 calls in there. We take a look at 18 oct. It's
626.38s: double and a half almost 243,000. That's really important because the way that the options have been
632.70s: flowing so far and games not have been inverted to that where the front cycle has been the heaviest
637.90s: by far leading to a bunch of turnover. That's not what we're seeing here, which again, I just find it
645.02s: remarkable, not remarkable as an unbelievable, but worth remarking. So that's that. The other
651.98s: thing is when I look at the wall, it's come down a lot. This has been highly informative for me.
657.66s: So I keep a really, really close eye on volatility and the volatility surface because it helps me
663.50s: understand market perception of movements. And I typically like this kind of view something like
668.70s: this and we can see a bunch of things. Now, one of the things I noticed with certainty is that we
674.78s: are back again to a generally normal configuration where in general, the put side runs higher
680.78s: vault than the call side. I track that because when I see the call side running higher
685.90s: vault than the put side, that's something I typically will trade. And it's also something that
689.82s: tells me something about market expectations of movement. So right now, we've kind of reverted
696.22s: back to what I would consider to be more normal. So overall, right now, GameStop is in a really
702.94s: interesting spot in my opinion. And I really hope that we start to see more of this puzzle unfolding
710.14s: because price is starting to move a little bit better. And I mean, right now it looks like we're
716.54s: starting to bump up against some near term resistance here at like the 22 and a half handle.
721.98s: See how that goes. But the point of control is still up here at 24 and it would not surprise me.
727.10s: Now that the suppression of the ATM is completed to see this start to drift back up because it's
732.14s: very clear to me that a lot of this downward pressure was due to that because as soon as that's
737.18s: been generally abated, we can see this thing flying. So I am really eager to see where we go from
743.18s: here. As always, if there's anything you want me to take a look at, let me know. I'll see you
746.54s: with the YouTube live stream later today at 5pm Pacific time. Be an outlier. I'll see you all later.
