0.00s: Let's talk about the best zero DTE options trading strategy.
5.00s: Do you know what it is?
6.60s: My guess is you probably don't because I don't either.
9.64s: The fact is nobody knows.
10.96s: There's not enough time in zero DTEs to have a definitive answer,
14.68s: but we have some pretty good ideas on what's working so far.
18.08s: So the goal of this video is to walk you through some of the research
21.08s: I've been doing from my data set as well as my actual trading data
25.60s: and talk you through what I'm seeing.
28.48s: That's working and what's not working.
30.04s: And then most importantly, I want to give you some ideas on how you can
34.44s: apply a similar methodology to figure out an approach for yourself.
37.84s: That might work really well for you and your trading book based on your specific
42.96s: needs. What's up, everyone?
44.52s: Eric here. Welcome back to the outliers.
46.20s: Shout out to the Patreon family.
47.56s: Consider signing up for weekly workshops on this exact kind of stuff.
51.88s: And let's dig right in.
53.00s: Okay. So what's the profit mechanism for these trades?
56.72s: Well, it's variance risk premium.
59.20s: And if you're unfamiliar with that concept, I'll throw a link in the description
63.80s: below that goes through in detail, but to summarize it simply put,
67.40s: it's the propensity for implied volatility to track above historic volatility,
72.68s: which means that we're pricing options more richly than what they're
76.64s: ending up moving.
77.92s: And we can make money off of that.
79.72s: And because of that, that's why I actually prefer sell style strategies
84.24s: for these time frames, so things like short straddles, strangles,
87.32s: primarily strangles, which you'll see in a little bit.
89.64s: Now, let's get a quick visual on variance risk premium.
94.04s: And essentially, these yellow lines are implied volatility.
97.92s: The white lines are historic volatility.
100.44s: And we make money when the yellow line is above the white line.
104.80s: And when the white line crosses above the yellow line,
107.60s: those are typically periods that we would have a losing trade.
110.56s: That means that in these instances, the markets priced in a lower implied
115.56s: volatility, which we would have sold, then accounted for the overall
121.20s: movement, which was much larger that that implied volatility.
125.72s: So let's take a look then at some of the structures that I've found to work.
130.72s: Now, this is kind of a cliff notes version.
132.76s: If we want a really in depth version, I can share something like that.
136.12s: It would be a long video because to summarize,
139.92s: I've traded these and tracked them both live since launch.
145.20s: And I have a massive data set where I have essentially looked at different
149.48s: permutations down to single delta variances and five minute entry windows.
155.20s: And I want to share some of the high levels or the highlights of that at a high level
161.48s: for you.
162.40s: So this is looking back around the launch of daily
165.84s: explorations in SPX.
167.88s: And there's a couple reasons why I prefer SPX for this tax advantages is a big one,
173.12s: but also sizing.
174.32s: So I don't have to put on as many positions.
176.76s: So I can decrease the number of transactions I have to make because it's very
181.40s: expensive.
182.00s: I have a video that dives into the world of zero DTEs with a bunch of different
185.92s: studies in depth.
187.08s: I'll also throw that in the description.
189.12s: But traders don't fully appreciate how expensive it is to trade zero DTEs.
194.32s: And it's because the transaction costs are kind of hidden from you.
197.28s: It's on the back end, not the commissions you're paying up front.
200.32s: It's the fills that you get the markets you have exposure to and the slippage on
204.56s: entries.
205.72s: So it's really important to consider that we want to decrease how much we're
208.88s: interacting with this stuff.
210.44s: The other thing that I've noticed that's not in this video, but if you're
213.60s: interested, I can bake it into a future video is a targeted frequency to entry.
219.04s: So what we're going to review today are more of a systematic approach that looks at
223.12s: a broader data set so that we can make informed decisions using as much data as
226.80s: possible.
227.64s: But what I have found is we know that volatility tends to cluster.
232.32s: Right.
232.60s: So if you notice this period right here that crossed above the implied
236.16s: volatility, historic volatility crossed above implied.
239.68s: This was on 22 February.
241.44s: Then on 23 February, it was also above.
243.68s: And then it came back down.
245.16s: So there was a two day period there in this case, it crossed above on the 13th
249.20s: stayed up for the 14th.
250.48s: And then it came back below on the 15th.
253.56s: We'll kind of write even with it.
255.64s: So what I'm highlighting is that you can actually apply a little bit of a momentum
259.40s: factor to deciding when you choose to enter is compared to just mechanically entering.
263.64s: But you don't have to do that.
265.36s: That's kind of the beauty of this stuff.
266.72s: Because again, if we look at this in the aggregate, it's kind of like dollar
270.12s: cost averaging more often than not implied is above historic.
276.60s: So you can get more specific with it like I like to mostly because I'm a nerd
281.48s: about this stuff.
282.12s: But a general rule that's applicable is it's normally there until it's not
286.64s: and then it generally comes back pretty quickly.
289.36s: That being variance risk premium.
292.60s: So let's take a look at a couple of trade examples here.
295.44s: We have different deltas for short calls, long calls, short puts, long puts.
301.40s: These are all one lots for ease.
303.36s: And the times of entry are in Eastern standard time.
307.00s: So this is 0 935 right after the open.
309.80s: And again, we're looking at from when zero DTE's daily explorations were launched
313.64s: until the fourth of June 2024.
317.12s: So we're not applying any profit or loss protocols.
321.36s: And let's take a look at what we see up front right out of the gate.
325.52s: I noticed that the 15 delta's definitely perform stronger than everything else
329.84s: by quite a lot.
331.00s: I also noticed that if you add wings to things, it helps and doesn't help.
335.80s: What that means is it helps for straddles which have persistently underperformed.
343.08s: So it makes sense that it would decrease the loss profile of those.
347.24s: So you can see our max loss goes from essentially 12 grand down to six.
350.52s: That helps this a lot.
352.40s: However, or something like the 15 delta short strangle,
357.40s: which if you're not fully sure what that looks like,
361.44s: essentially we would come in here.
362.76s: We would find the option closest to a 15 delta on the put side.
365.92s: So in this case, there's a 16 delta.
367.96s: And then there's a 17 delta right here.
370.12s: So we would sell those.
371.60s: Now this is one DTE.
373.20s: That's only because the markets closed right now.
375.04s: So the zero DTEs have expired.
376.88s: There's no premium in them.
377.96s: Just so you know why I'm looking out of one.
379.76s: But I just want to show you what the structure looks like, which is this right here.
383.28s: So a couple things to keep in mind as we look at this.
387.20s: It has nice big profit zones, which is great.
389.72s: But you'll notice a kind of nefarious component to this.
393.12s: If you look at the purple line, the unrealized loss before expiration,
399.20s: at this point, right at your break even is negative 1200 bucks.
403.32s: But you actually would make two bucks if you held it and essentially time to
408.12s: cater out and it stayed right there.
409.80s: That matters a lot.
410.76s: The reason why it matters a lot is as we look at applying management protocols,
415.00s: you have to be careful about stopping yourself out too early.
418.92s: So a couple of other things to note here, the super small delta, specifically the
424.92s: fives, they seem to outperform the 10 delta's ever so slightly.
429.84s: And it looks like that primarily derives from reduced max losses and a pretty high
436.88s: premium on the win rate.
438.64s: So notice there's a five delta variance between these, but the win rate is pretty
443.64s: meaningful as compared to if you look at the variance between the 10 and 15 and
448.16s: the difference between the win rates there.
451.08s: So the five delta's have a little bit of an edge for the win rate.
455.76s: However, they're just not collecting that much, which is why they don't perform
458.76s: while. So next, if you're looking at data sets like this, one of the first things
463.12s: we should be eyeballing is, okay, we're the extremes.
465.84s: And we found the extremes pretty simply, right?
468.96s: It's these losses.
469.80s: They're massive compared to the average wins or even the max wins on all of them.
475.64s: So if I'm building a strategy, the first thing I want to do is look at a really
479.08s: big data set, then I want to start seeing what themes I can find and tinker
483.96s: managing those and see what it does.
485.84s: And then we need to segment the data set to make sure that we're not overfitting
489.08s: too much because right now we're looking at all historic data.
492.52s: Whatever we see in these tests is not going to be what happens in the future.
497.24s: So what we need to see is how much does our management approach impact the
503.20s: performance of the strategies and the robustness?
505.80s: We don't want to see a bunch of variants year over year because then that means
510.68s: that we're getting to a point where we're grossly overfitting.
512.80s: And when we go to out of sample data set, meaning going forward, your performance
519.40s: will probably change drastically from what you back tested.
522.32s: So we're looking for robustness here.
524.40s: Now, this idea of cutting off the tails is nothing novel.
527.52s: I'll actually throw another video in the description below that talks about
531.00s: this exact process and what I'm doing is looking for extreme.
534.48s: So in this case, I tinkered with a bunch of different stop losses and 200%
541.16s: tends to work generally well across time frames.
544.32s: Again, without grossly overfitting.
546.48s: So in this case, this is essentially a three times credit received loss.
550.68s: And let's take a look at what happens across the entire data set.
553.60s: First thing that jumps out at me is everything performs better across the board.
558.52s: That matters quite a lot.
560.52s: Even down to the straddles with the five Delta wings, they still lose,
565.96s: but it's a little bit less than over here.
568.32s: The fact that this positively impacts everything across the board to varying
573.28s: degrees, it tells me that we're on the right track in terms of what adjustments
576.80s: were applying. Now cliff notes, if we look through the difference that it makes
582.84s: for these different strategies, pay attention as we look at some of the
585.80s: different permutations going forward.
587.76s: But right now at this point, the 10 Delta's have grossly, grossly outperform
593.24s: the fives as compared to what we saw earlier.
595.32s: Why is that?
596.32s: Because we're controlling the tails.
598.28s: So what this is telling us is that if we looked at each trade in the data,
601.76s: data sample that there are a handful of extremes that were greatly skewing
607.48s: our overall performance and what we cut those out specifically to the downside.
613.00s: All of a sudden, this has become a really high performing strategy.
617.16s: The 10 and the 15 Delta's.
619.56s: So now let's take a look at another thing, which is the time of entry.
623.28s: Again, I look at essentially five minute increments throughout every single day,
628.08s: but I'm giving you a slightly abridged version for ease of following.
634.00s: And I want you to notice a couple of things we look across this data set.
637.40s: What do you see?
638.60s: The first thing I notice again is that everything across the board performs way
645.40s: better way better.
648.04s: So this tells me again that we're on the right path.
651.68s: And you can tinker with all different kind of time entries.
655.40s: But I noticed that the afternoon within a few hours of the close performs very,
659.28s: very well.
660.40s: So what do we see happening here?
662.48s: Well, interestingly enough, our straddles now are the top performing strategy.
668.64s: So what's that what that's telling me is that the beginning of the day,
672.28s: the volatility that are being priced into the straddles aren't enough to keep up
675.52s: with the movement throughout the day, but towards the end of the day,
678.52s: it's obviously pretty lucrative, which is a very interesting find in my opinion.
683.36s: So let's move this over one more.
686.84s: And I want to show you the next logical look, which is combining the later day entry
694.00s: with the stops.
695.20s: And what do we see?
696.12s: Well, we see a couple of things.
697.32s: One, the profitability on most of them actually comes down.
703.88s: Why would that be?
705.68s: Because in this case, we're managing a lot of the volatility by time.
711.20s: When you layer on something else on top of that, in this case, stops.
715.96s: What's happening is throughout the end of the day, you're getting stopped out
720.20s: on way too many trades that actually come back in to become winners.
724.76s: So what this tells me is this stop is actually probably too tight.
729.80s: So we can look at actually expanding the stop loss from 200% out to 300%
736.60s: and again, notice what happens here.
739.04s: We see a total expansion across the board because now we're not prematurely
745.68s: stopping ourselves out for trade that end up coming back in to be winning positions.
752.36s: So the last thing I want to highlight is zooming in on this sample.
756.76s: Now where we're entering at 2 p.m.
759.28s: Eastern time exiting at 300% max.
763.28s: Credit received.
764.76s: And I guess it's max loss on the credit received.
769.40s: But looking at this year over year, I want to look for robustness.
773.76s: And one of the things I'm looking for is how crazily do things tend to flip.
779.32s: And it's kind of a really important thing to consider, right?
783.44s: So this is a partial year.
784.68s: This is 2022 the second half of the year.
786.76s: This is all 2023.
787.92s: And then this is 2024.
789.72s: Notice what at least I see is if I look at the performance of the
794.92s: straddles, it essentially flip-flops almost tremendously.
798.96s: So we have it being top performer to being second to worst and the worst with the
803.64s: wing and then back towards the top so far this year.
807.24s: And if I look at kind of the solid performers across the board, it's the 15
811.76s: and the 10 Delta short strangles.
815.72s: So you have to figure out what's right for you.
817.60s: A couple of things to consider though are for me, I very size based on how
824.44s: much I can quantify the risk premium and what looks more attractive.
828.96s: I've also started instituting a intraday volatility sampling to help me
833.32s: forecast what it might be throughout the rest of the day.
835.84s: And that also uses kind of that moving average thesis I was talking to you
840.16s: about a little bit earlier.
841.72s: If there's a big catalyst, sometimes it's worth downsizing because you're
846.04s: going to collect more premium anyways because of the implied volatility being
849.84s: so elevated.
851.12s: And the last thing is I've started instituting a Delta rebalancing protocol
856.44s: in another sample of this trade.
858.28s: It's way too early to really derive anything from that.
861.24s: But so far that also looks promising.
863.56s: So what's the best strategy?
865.72s: In my opinion, it would be either short premium via short straddles or
871.76s: short strangles.
873.12s: You can modify the risk protocols based on what you want.
876.40s: It's a little too early to see.
878.08s: But for me and what I'm looking to expose myself to, it's primarily looking
884.36s: more like short strangles, although they slightly underperformed.
888.00s: There's much less year over year volatility in the performance of the
891.88s: strategies.
892.48s: So we'll see.
893.48s: Let me know what you think in the comments below.
896.08s: Be an outlier.
896.88s: I'll see you all later.
