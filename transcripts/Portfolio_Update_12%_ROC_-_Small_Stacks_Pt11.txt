0.48s: hey everyone eric here so it's a little
3.44s: bit later that's why i got the lights on
5.20s: but i'm trying to do my best to stay a
7.52s: little closer to when i'm making the
9.28s: updates to the small stacks account
11.36s: so that is why we are currently
14.72s: hanging out even though it's a little
15.92s: bit later than usual so let's jump over
18.16s: the screen
18.80s: and take a look at what we did now if
21.20s: you'll notice
21.92s: i currently have no uh coverage
24.80s: strangles or cash secured puts out where
27.28s: we were empty on that as of right now
30.72s: so today i took down the xle
34.72s: 29 puts and i paid 58 cents it was a
38.64s: little bit lower than what i wanted
41.12s: but realistically it was a
44.40s: it was pretty close to 20 capture
48.24s: and the trade was uh on for
51.44s: a little bit longer than i was
54.08s: anticipating so
55.68s: the reason why i wanted to take this
57.28s: down is as i was seeing the market kind
59.12s: of moving around today
60.64s: i said it before i really would prefer
64.32s: not to be an xle long term
66.24s: so i kind of you know took the took the
68.56s: few bucks i could get out of it
69.92s: and and went on my way typically
73.52s: i would have left this on a little bit
75.76s: longer
76.88s: but like i said when i saw about 20
80.08s: capture in um in a week or so 10 days
83.52s: ish
84.00s: well eight days um i i didn't want to
86.72s: leave it on for the rest of the duration
88.32s: so
88.96s: that is why that is down
92.08s: so right now nothing on the cash secured
95.68s: put front
96.64s: hunting especially with the market
98.48s: coming down a little bit towards the end
99.92s: of the day today
101.04s: so we'll see if any opportunity comes up
104.24s: of note i did make an adjustment to
107.12s: kroger
108.24s: and then i also established a diagonal
111.76s: in
112.00s: ford now i want to be clear
115.36s: when i look at ford i'm not too excited
118.56s: about it this is kind of like the xle
120.48s: trade
121.52s: the the company itself i think is doing
124.96s: fine but this isn't something that i'm
127.76s: like
128.08s: yes you know this thing's gonna be just
130.00s: the next thing that blows up
131.44s: i don't really feel that way whatsoever
133.84s: but it's providing a really good return
136.16s: so that's why i ventured into ford
139.28s: so what i'm looking at here is
142.32s: i'll pop back over to the screen and we
144.24s: can take a look at
145.68s: ford that's this one yeah so what we're
148.16s: looking at
148.88s: is on the 30th of september i
152.08s: jumped in the 21gn22
155.20s: four calls i got three of them and i
157.12s: paid three dollars and two cents
159.36s: it was for 88 delta which is really good
162.88s: nice and liquid on the leaps which i
164.80s: love to see
166.48s: and i sent out two
170.16s: of the 30 october 7 calls
173.52s: collecting 36 cents which was a delta of
176.64s: 53
178.00s: and that's bringing in 72 or about an 8
181.44s: percent return on invested capital it's
183.04s: a great return so that's really what
184.40s: brought me to this trade
185.60s: when i was looking through the
186.56s: financials for i really like
188.72s: the overall return on capital for the
191.92s: trade
192.40s: it's strong and then i also if you'll
195.28s: notice
196.08s: it's an uncovered diagonal so if it
198.48s: continues above
199.60s: seven then we can continue cruising
202.72s: along
203.36s: um cruising along from there and the
206.24s: current price is in three dollars fifty
207.76s: five cents the current price
209.28s: for ford is 698. so you can see what i'm
212.24s: doing here i'm
213.68s: specifically structuring this trade so
216.24s: there's a very high probability that
217.92s: it's going to close above my strike
219.84s: and i'll take the trade down essentially
221.84s: for for a profit
223.04s: and that's that's the name of the game
224.88s: here
226.32s: right now both the leap and
229.52s: the the short call are looking good
232.64s: the leaps are trading right now for 355
236.56s: so there is a bit of a unrealized gain
240.08s: there
240.96s: and the um
244.48s: the short calls are you know about same
247.76s: same
248.24s: not much of a change there so that is
251.28s: what we're looking at in
252.32s: ford next up is kroger
256.08s: not anything crazy in here pretty simple
258.32s: adjustment what i ended up doing is
260.48s: adding another short call just because i
263.60s: it's exactly what i was talking about
264.64s: before sometimes i like to add these
266.56s: short calls
267.28s: when i see premium really skyrocket so
270.00s: that's what i did here
271.44s: so in this scenario it started as an
274.48s: uncovered diagonal i had two
277.52s: long calls one short call and then when
280.64s: i saw premium start floating above a
282.88s: dollar 25 for that 3556 nov
286.56s: call that's when i decided i wanted to
288.40s: add another so now we're at a one-to-one
290.64s: ratio which is a
291.84s: still of no upside risk in this trade
295.60s: but i have 185 dollars of
298.80s: credit out which i'm very happy with
302.08s: so we'll keep rolling this diagonal
304.32s: around as needed and see what
306.32s: uh see what it turns out to be but so
308.16s: far the kroger diagonal is essentially
310.64s: doing exactly what i would hope for it
312.32s: to do
313.44s: okay so looking at the entire portfolio
315.68s: right now quick wrap up
317.36s: overall capital in the account is
320.76s: 56.82 and we're utilizing
325.12s: just under 2 300 bucks so we're only
328.24s: using 40
329.12s: of the account we have plenty of cash to
331.12s: deploy when we see some opportunity so
333.76s: like i said i'm going to continue
335.20s: looking for things that look
337.04s: interesting hopefully for a cash secured
340.64s: put but i'm not gonna force it if i
342.32s: don't see anything
343.44s: as always the biggest pain on the ass
345.60s: here is finding something i can cast
347.36s: secure
348.08s: that fits the size of the account it's
350.32s: just the name of the game when you're
351.76s: when you're working with such a small
353.20s: account it's very difficult to trade the
355.76s: products that i like to trade
357.92s: in in this account so that's why we're
360.96s: starting to see me trading more
362.48s: diagonals
363.84s: just because they're more cost efficient
366.16s: for getting
367.20s: the getting the account moving forward
369.76s: there's also a chance that i'll start
371.60s: throwing in
372.24s: a couple long calls i like to do that
375.76s: in things like vxx when i see the market
378.72s: capitulating a little bit
380.56s: so if i start seeing volatility or
382.24s: getting the sense that volatility is
383.68s: going to start moving up or continue to
385.36s: move up
386.80s: there's a good chance i'll add some long
388.48s: vxx calls
389.84s: i typically don't like buying out of the
391.84s: money calls but again
393.44s: in this scenario i will be relegated to
395.84s: some sort of that trade
397.84s: but ideally i will find a cash secured
400.56s: put that i like
401.60s: to use up um you know 20 or less
404.88s: so about 2 000 to cash secured is what
407.04s: we're looking at
408.24s: um overall return for the portfolio
411.28s: since starting on one september's 12
413.28s: percent i
414.72s: am so happy with that i think that
418.16s: that is a great return for an account
421.68s: this size
422.56s: even for an annual return so overall i
426.08s: i'm really
427.12s: really happy with that the vast majority
430.80s: of return is coming from the diagonal
432.80s: as i was talking about just more
434.32s: efficient and
436.00s: as we're looking forward i currently
438.64s: have 124 dollars in credit outstanding
441.68s: so that represents just shy of a 2.2
445.04s: return on the account so in general
447.76s: we're looking
448.56s: we're looking good the account is moving
450.56s: along as
451.60s: expected actually a little better than
453.20s: expected we haven't really
454.96s: had to work through anything honestly
458.08s: yet so
459.12s: plenty plenty of room to continue
461.28s: developing the account
462.72s: if you guys see anything that looks
463.92s: interesting for um cash secure put let
466.64s: me know
467.20s: i'm on the hunt right now and when i do
470.08s: find something obviously i'll throw it
471.92s: on and then i'll
472.72s: send out another update so as always if
474.96s: you have any questions on what i'm doing
476.40s: why i'm doing drop me a line let me know
478.56s: the whole point of this account is to
480.00s: have a dialogue i'm i'm
481.60s: straight up not doing this for me i
483.20s: don't really get anything out of it
484.96s: it's challenging and it's fun so there's
487.44s: that but
488.08s: i would rather investing to just be very
490.16s: boring like it is in my margin account
492.40s: so um let me know what i can do to make
495.84s: this
496.32s: a better experience for you guys or if
498.56s: there's anything
499.44s: you know that that you have want to talk
501.60s: through let me know
503.04s: because again that's the whole point of
504.40s: all this alright so
506.08s: i hope everybody enjoys the rest of the
507.68s: week and i will talk to everyone later
