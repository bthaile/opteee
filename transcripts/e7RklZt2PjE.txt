0.00s: You're going to trade them. I'm going to trade them. So let's talk about how we trade them.
3.52s: What exactly? Zero DTE options. I'm going to walk you through a guide on some of the things that
8.40s: I think she'd keep in mind. Pros and cons. First, second, I want to walk you through the downfall
13.44s: of retail traders, integration of them into their strategies via data from a handful of studies
19.04s: that I really like that I also juxtapose against my own data set. But nobody should trust my data set.
25.44s: I think it's better to use the stuff that you can find that's peer reviewed. So we're going to go
28.88s: through that. But I'll integrate some of the things that I found personally along the way.
32.48s: And then at the end of the video, I'll walk you through exactly how I integrate zero DTE
37.12s: expressions into my trading style and how I like to trade them. So without further ado,
40.72s: what's up everybody? Eric here. Welcome back to all the outliers. A huge shout out to the Patreon
45.12s: family and the YouTube members. You guys make this all possible. This takes a lot of time to put
49.76s: together to give you good information. So let's get straight into this video. The very first thing
54.72s: that I want to talk about some pros and cons. And what you're going to notice from this list is it's
58.40s: not labeled as a pro or a con. And it's because it really depends on the side of the trade that you're
62.32s: on. So for example, gamma, this really helps long options. So if we're on expiration day, gamma is
70.24s: super high because every single option needs to approximate to one or two spots, either a zero
77.60s: or a one delta, meaning it's out of the money or in the money. That's what's happening on expiration
83.12s: day. So gamma is very high because all options need to do that. That benefits buyers. It hurts
88.96s: sellers. What's the trade off here? Well, theta is also fast moving like gamma that benefits
95.60s: sellers, not buyers, because all of the options that are out of the money need to approximate to zero.
102.16s: So that means theta is going to decay very, very fast. So for a great example of this,
106.72s: let's hop over to the platform. If we take a look at SPX here and we go to four main, which is
111.04s: today's expiration, notice how everything that's out of the money is now essentially bid zero
116.48s: offered at five, which means that's the minimum bid I spread. These are all worthless. And then
120.88s: if we go to one day to expiration, notice how much premium is still in these options. But what I
125.60s: really want to hone you in on is this gamma. That's this column here. It's a little difficult to see,
130.00s: but gamma for at the money options relative to the cost here is going to be pretty high. And it's
135.84s: because they need to make that decision. If they're out of the money, they're going to zero. If
139.92s: they're in the money, they're going to whatever their intrinsic value is. So again, that kind of
143.92s: depending on what side of the coin here, whether you're buying or selling and it's really the same
147.44s: for calls or puts this fast moving theta and gamma benefits both or hurts both. The volatility
153.84s: edge really is going to benefit the sellers out there. And this is an important concept too, though.
158.40s: And this is actually going to be one of the things we talk about later. But this really just falls
162.72s: into theta decay. In some case, if you're a seller and that's it, the fast moving component is
169.44s: what draws people to these products. But depending on what side of the trade you're on, it's going to
174.00s: have a different impact. This, however, is universal. No overnight risk. If you put on these trades,
179.60s: you can go to sleep and just chill out because there's no overnight risk. Now a super important note
184.80s: here, though, is I think traders perpetually look for a boogie man. They're looking for something to
190.16s: justify a behavior. And overnight risk is not as scary as it is. What I mean by that is if you look
196.32s: at portfoliovisualizer.com, you throw in a $10,000 portfolio and you look back 30 years, whatever
202.56s: the case is. That has a lot of overnight risk. There's a lot of nights over the course of holding
206.64s: that product. But somehow it turns out, okay, it makes money. The point being is overnight risk is
210.64s: not the boogie man here. And there's ways to overcome that by the way we structure the trades,
215.04s: what's I'm going to get into in a minute. So while this is a benefit to be very clear, not having
219.68s: overnight risk is a benefit, I would not permit your mind to say, oh, I should only trade zero
226.08s: DTE options because they have no overnight risk. And that's where all the risk is. It is not the case.
230.48s: The risk is actually in your shitty strategy. That's it. So with that little disclaimer aside,
236.24s: let's take a look now at what the con is. What's the con? This is the largest drawback of zero DTE
243.28s: options. And I cannot emphasize this point enough. We're going to talk about this at length.
248.08s: Now you might be saying to yourself, Eric, the cost is only the 40 cents per contract that I'm
253.76s: putting on. That's not so bad. Not the case. So coming back over here again to the platform,
260.08s: if we go here to one data expiration and you take a look at the bid-esque spread, there's slippage
266.32s: involved in where you actually get your fill. So this is the 4060 at the money put is bid at 19 offered
275.12s: at 1950. That's 50 cents right there right out of the gate in addition to your fees that you pay
280.80s: on top. And we're relative comparison. If we go out here to 16 June and we go to this at the money,
286.56s: these are worth the same 4060s. Their bid 91 80 offered 93 50. So as a percentage, these are massively
294.80s: more expensive. That's like a 2% plus bid-esque spread based on the relative value of this compared
300.48s: to out here. This is like 1.85%. So the point being is the spreads you're paying on these again
307.12s: on a relative basis is massive. And that's important because we're going to talk more about cost in a
311.52s: minute. But this is this is really what we're fighting against here. And we're going to talk about
315.92s: how we can do that. Okay, so this is going to be the paper I'm referencing, whichever way should
319.76s: point in this scenario. This is the paper we're going to be talking about. And there's a bunch of
324.08s: other details that I'm baking into this from both my own data set and then a couple of other
329.20s: ancillary information sources. But I wanted to use a peer reviewed data source because there's
334.56s: no reason for anybody to really put a whole bunch of weight on my data, although I certainly do.
339.04s: It is still worthwhile, I think to draw some parallels between these two. But this is a pretty
343.52s: well done paper. There's to be very clear. There's holes in any paper that's done. So I do not want
348.88s: you to look at this as if this is the end all be authority on everything. It's not they make
352.80s: assumptions. They have to. But we can still learn a lot from this paper. So with that aside, let's get
358.96s: straight into it. What do traders do? Well, we can tell that traders in general have really started
366.24s: taking on to this idea of zero DTE expiration. So you can see a zero DTE here orange and notice
373.60s: how wide of a space this is taking up in monthly trading volume. I guess you can't do that.
378.96s: My stupid face is in the way. Maybe you can now. But as you can see, this is a massive space
385.52s: that they're consuming. This means that the demand is huge. The same thing is if we take a look at
391.12s: zero DTE one DTE two, so on and so forth, notice how prevalent this is compared to everything out
398.08s: there. And if you take a look at just short term duration, so essentially zero and one DTE,
403.84s: that is also massive. So overall, there has been a huge spike in monthly trading volume
410.40s: centralized in zero DTE stuff. Now, we're going to look at slim trading volume and the
417.28s: blift notes version of what the hell slim is. It's a way for us to look at trade level data from
422.96s: CBO and identify the highest probability of retail trades. This does not mean that every trade listed
429.28s: in here is retail, but we know with relative confidence that most of it is going to be. And this
435.60s: is something that I also track personally. So I'm familiar with this concept, but the again,
440.48s: Clifft notes version is there was a price improvement protocol put in a place for small orders and
445.52s: indices and whatnot. And most of retail orders fall into that bucket of essentially 10 lots or
450.96s: less. So this is how we're drawing on that. It's not perfect, but it's pretty good. So what I want
455.76s: to highlight here, though, is the monthly you can essentially insert retail trader volume in
461.60s: general here, the monthly retail trader volume. Take a look at the total volume, which is blue
466.88s: and how much of that total volume is zero DTE. It kind of explains itself. Ever since we had COVID,
472.56s: we started launching more explorations. There's a demand for it. And it's just been maintained
477.68s: to a pretty significant order. And you can see the slim share compared to total volume. So we have
483.76s: it breaks down zero DTE, non, and then total, so on and so forth. The point being is it's
488.08s: extremely popular and it's not slowing down. That's not a good thing or a bad thing. It just
491.44s: means that it's very common. Now, this is where we start getting into kind of more of the specific
496.24s: details that I think is pertinent to most people. And this is breaking down zero DTE trading volume
502.56s: from again, non retail versus retail. And there's a few notes here that I think are important to you.
509.60s: And I've highlighted them here. When we talk about the breakdown between calls and puts,
513.36s: it's essentially same same for retail versus non retail light ever so slight variants between
518.64s: the two. Nothing noteworthy. If we look at the size again, you can see that the gross centralization
524.64s: for retail is in single contracts. And that's not the case for non retail. It's still overwhelming
531.60s: single contracts, but there's a bigger breakout between two to five and so on and so forth. So
536.24s: when we look at these though, this is where it starts to get important. When we look at the
539.84s: direction, whether we're buying or selling, you can see that there is a kind of centralization
545.92s: in buying for retail, but selling for institutions. Now, I want to be super clear before all of the
551.76s: theta gang people out there start saying like, oh, shit, yep, I got it right. This is all I should
556.08s: be doing. Let me put my stupid face right in the middle of the screen to hopefully intercede that
560.32s: thought process. That is not the case. Selling is not some sort of magic potion that fixes everything.
565.84s: It's really important not to understand why selling works and when selling works. I'm not going
570.08s: to go super far into detail on this video. I will throw a link to a really great video that I made
575.20s: in the notes below on this exact concept, but it is important to note that in general,
580.24s: Belling does have a benefit if it's properly deployed, which is why you will see this breakdown
587.04s: where non retail tends to favor selling a bit. Now, whether it's call or puts, you can see that this
593.84s: is slightly inverted and there's going to be more selling of both on this side, but if you'll
599.76s: notice, when we look at the buy versus sell calls versus puts, it's nothing too crazy to walk
606.24s: away from here other than you could tell that we prefer selling and from a non retail perspective
612.72s: and on a retail perspective, they're looking to buy. So, that aside, I want to start getting into
617.28s: some other specifics. And this is one of the funny things, right? We get to joke about this because
622.80s: it is funny, but it's also sad to me at the same time, which is the people on Wall Street bats
627.68s: love them. I am a fellow ate myself and a degenerate in a lot of instances, but in this case,
633.12s: it's killing them. And the part that makes me sad is a lot of these people don't have a bunch of
636.72s: money to lose. What this means is this is just looking how popular zero DTE mentions on Reddit has
642.48s: become and you can see essentially from COVID. Somewhere in here on, it's exploded. And what does
648.32s: this mean? It's lottery. People really want to use these as lottery. They want to be able to make
654.24s: a lot of money very fast. And that's not that's not what's happening here. You can see this is
658.80s: actually looking at net and gross profits. Remember before when I was really harping on this concept
664.16s: of cost, well, this is where it's coming to bear. Take a look at the orange gross profits. Even in
671.04s: the periods where retail was doing okay with gross profits, it's about cut almost in half after fees.
677.92s: Even in this peak where they did really well, fees took out a giant chunk, something to the tune
684.56s: of 40, 50, 60 percent depending on which exact way you're looking at. And it gets worse because
689.52s: when retail traders are gross losing money, meaning they're just wrong, the net after fees is
696.56s: massive. These are killing these people and it's a bummer to see. So what's going on here? Well,
702.64s: again, the fees are not relegated to just the commissions you pay. There are also fees that you get
709.12s: from slippage, transaction costs, payment for order flow, non, not super competitive pricing. All
714.32s: of these sorts of things start to hurt you. Now, the SIBO did institute that price improvement
718.64s: program back in 2020 and that did help, but it doesn't fix the problem because payment for order
723.12s: flow still exists. So all of this summarized up just means fees are hurting. So if we take a look at
728.48s: net profits of $100,000, this is looking at month by month. There's a 25 sample size. There are four
735.20s: profitable months net profits. There are nine profitable months, gross. So we literally are cut in half
743.68s: in terms of our aggregate profitable trades month over month after we include fees. You cannot
749.04s: underestimate the cost of doing business as a retail trader. This is also why when retail traders
754.48s: talk about, oh, I like to scalp one. You don't because retail traders really were not equipped to
759.68s: scalp. Scalping is like seconds. It is when you are in and out super fast. That is what high
763.84s: frequency trading algorithms are doing to essentially capture bit-ass differences, mispriceings,
768.56s: arbitrage, stuff like that. In general, retail is not going to be fast enough, but the bastardized
773.44s: version of scalping we do, which really is just intraday trading. We think it sounds cool. We heard,
779.12s: you know, Tom Sausanoff say it, who I like, but everybody wanted to start doing it so it's cool.
783.52s: The problem is it doesn't work well, especially once you add in fees, not just to mention how
789.60s: difficult it is to get small time frames correct, directionally. That is one of the hardest time
795.60s: frames to get direct, directionally correct. What do you mean? It's such a short-term time frame.
799.20s: Why is it so difficult? Because that's when randomness is at the highest probability. If you think
803.76s: about where the stock market is going to be 10 years from now, what do you think? Higher or lower?
808.16s: I would bet higher. And if somebody wants to make that bet, hit me up. I do think it could be an
812.48s: interesting thing to follow along. And the point being though, most people probably would be confident
818.72s: that it's going to be higher in 10 years relative than it is today. But if you talk about whether
823.12s: or not the S&P 500 is going to go up within a five-second increment or a 10-second increment,
827.52s: very difficult. And then you add fees on top of that because scalping typically includes a lot
832.56s: of very small profits and then not just, again, commissions, but the cost associated with doing it
836.88s: very difficult to make money. Okay, now that that horse is beat thoroughly to death, let's just talk
841.12s: about this concept of expensiveness. This is actually pretty cool to me. So from this paper,
845.84s: they actually found that retail orders do better in high-vict's environments. And this is typically
851.20s: when people are attempting to sell, but over the duration, traders actually became more sensitive
857.36s: to the expensiveness of options, which I actually think is super cool. So let's talk now very quickly
864.08s: about kind of the somewhat of all of this. Well, it's pretty simple. That retail traders really
869.52s: like lottery-like assets, which is a bummer, but it's to no surprise, there's a reason why the
874.08s: lottery makes so much money. And zero DTE options enable that. And right now retail traders, again,
880.00s: in aggregate essentially lose $358,000 a day on zero DTE S&P 500 options. That's awful. This is
889.20s: the most disturbing part. Our findings indicate that more than 60% of the lost each day comes in the
895.36s: form of transaction costs. Easier enemy. I think that we have that point down. So let's talk about
900.32s: what I do. The very first thing is now that we understand the fight that we're fighting, we now
905.92s: understand that we need to be very careful of costs, and we need to construct strategies that
910.96s: enable us to do that. So what does that mean? Well, if you like to trade spreads, which I don't,
915.60s: especially in this context, if you're trading iron condors and verticals and zero DTE stuff,
921.04s: you are literally getting chute alive. So I typically prefer simple single options, whether it's
926.24s: short calls, short puts, short straddles, short strangles, it's typically going to be short straddles.
930.80s: And notice how I emphasize short on all of those, I tend to sell. And the reason why I tend to sell
935.76s: is because there is a delta range that is really beneficial to sell, especially in short term
943.04s: time frames, because of this, the IV HV variance is very large and it needs to approximate. So
950.64s: if you are trading in a period where the variance between implied and short volatility is very high,
956.16s: you start to stack the deck in your favor. And again, that video I linked to before will go
960.08s: through this in more detail. But this is really important because notice how I didn't say when
964.16s: implied volatility percentile is high or when implied volatility is high or when implied
968.88s: volatility rank is high. It's because that's not the period that actually matters. What we're trying to
974.56s: capture is the variance risk premium in this scenario. And that is when IV is overstated compared to
979.76s: HV that can happen when implied volatility percentile is high, when it's low, what we want to avoid
985.20s: is when it's in a transition period. That's bad. So this is when we really try to benefit from the
989.28s: clustering properties of volatility. So the other thing here is limit frequency. This isn't my go to,
994.64s: I trade and I actually traded it this week on the Fed rate announcement. I traded zero DTE options.
1000.72s: That's because there's a clear catalyst things like Fed announcements, things like earning statements,
1006.48s: earnings releases. Those are all great catalysts that really give us a bigger kind of piece of the
1012.72s: pie that we potentially can chew off. And then the other scenarios when there's a large IV HV
1018.00s: variance because again, I'm going to tend to sell and that's what I want to see. Notice how there's
1021.92s: only really two conditions here. This isn't because I think I can make money faster. I don't.
1026.24s: This isn't because I'm scared of overnight risk. I'm not. This is really the two scenarios where
1031.04s: this makes sense for me to integrate into my overall approach. So if this video is helpful, don't
1036.40s: forget to comment below what you found useful. Like, subscribe, be an outlier, share with some friends,
1041.44s: and I'll catch you guys later.
