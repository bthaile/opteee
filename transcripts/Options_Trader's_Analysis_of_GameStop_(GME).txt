0.52s: what's up Abes time for your GameStop
3.12s: update as promised every week we're
5.76s: taking a look at it even though this
7.16s: week is a little bit quiet there's a
9.24s: couple things I want to highlight and I
10.56s: do want to spend a little time talking
12.04s: about some of the latest news around
13.68s: store closures analyst estimates and
16.12s: stuff like that I do think it kind of
18.00s: paints a little bit of a picture for
19.68s: where we're at with the stock NOW first
22.00s: thing price performance you can see that
24.20s: we're actually leveling off here and
26.72s: this is a very welcome surprise of these
30.36s: lines have been drawn recently these are
33.00s: all things that have been existing on
34.24s: the chart for a little while and I draw
36.36s: that point out just because you can see
38.44s: that this down move has been in a couple
40.84s: different stages this hasn't been
42.48s: parabolic down it's been down big down
45.72s: day but then consolidation down slight
49.44s: drift down then Gap up consolidation
51.84s: sideways then three down days and now we
54.80s: are consolidating sideways so what this
57.84s: tells me is that the market is still
61.96s: both well GameStop is susceptible to the
64.12s: broader Market movements but then it's
66.32s: also still catching bids which in the
69.76s: grand scheme of things is really solid I
72.28s: think now it does need to make a choice
77.16s: from essentially this Zone that's
79.28s: building out it's good that it's
81.80s: trending sideways through this
83.40s: especially as the market was showing
84.88s: some pretty heavy weakness during the
86.68s: same stage if we take a look at another
89.64s: chart really quick just to share that
92.76s: point more closely I want to give you a
95.88s: specific comparison point because I
98.32s: think it is useful so let's take a look
101.32s: at GameStop well actually let's take a
103.16s: look at small caps here we'll take a
104.80s: look at iwm and then we already have
106.80s: GameStop up so that's great and let's
109.08s: Zoom these out a little bit more just to
110.96s: get a bit more data points in there to
112.76s: the LA can't do that with GameStop I
114.48s: forgot cuz it's gone completely
116.40s: parabolic within the last year so we
118.92s: have to tighten this up
120.48s: so let's take a look I want you to
122.72s: specifically monitor the time frames
125.36s: from this part of the chart right so I'm
127.36s: kind of highlighting the 20th here and
129.48s: then the same period here and I want you
133.00s: to take a look at the move in GameStop
136.20s: relative to small caps over this time
138.76s: frame right so GameStop has been showing
141.64s: some pretty significant relative
143.24s: strength even if we go out to large cap
145.92s: stocks and again we use the same
148.00s: reference period of essentially from the
150.76s: 20th which is right here on both and if
154.64s: we look at the moves here GameStop has
156.64s: gone from 27 and now it's sitting at 25
160.56s: so definitely a pretty big decline on a
164.16s: percentage basis but 2. decline
166.48s: otherwise so it's around 10% but then we
171.44s: can see on the 20th here on a relative
175.04s: basis S&P 500's gone from 612 down to
178.48s: 583 the main thing is obviously in a
182.52s: volatility adjusted move 10% in GameStop
185.20s: is kind of a nothing don't it's standard
188.60s: Fair GameStop moves a lot and if you
191.24s: take a look at the average true range or
193.96s: average daily range comparison in the
195.68s: S&P 500 this is accelerated massively
198.64s: over this time frame right so if you
200.32s: take a look over the last 90day period
203.56s: the average true range is 1.16 then it
206.40s: goes to 1.33 and then it effectiv
210.44s: almost doubles to 2.3 whereas if we take
213.72s: a look at the difference between the
214.88s: 20-day on GameStop which is 5% and then
217.60s: on a 5day it's
219.52s: 4.7% so even though on a relative basis
222.56s: this is moving a lot relative to
224.20s: GameStop specifically it's actually kind
226.68s: of a stabilizing factor which is very
228.52s: interesting to see that aside I did go
232.64s: through the options chain as per usual
234.48s: just to see if anything sticks out to us
237.16s: and uh honestly not much there was a
240.56s: little bit of a spike today that I can
242.72s: see here with respect to net call
245.80s: Premium but it's still not like a
248.76s: tremendously massive amount or anything
251.20s: that I would say like oh yeah this is a
253.80s: game changer something crazy is going on
255.76s: here I will say that this is notably
258.56s: bullish though compared to effectively
261.56s: the last two months we haven't hit the
263.56s: same 1 mil level since towards the end
266.84s: of April the net call Premium has been
269.48s: pretty pretty light so the fact that it
271.72s: is skewing bullish today is actually
275.80s: noteworthy in and of itself from a net
278.60s: premium perspective and then if we take
280.96s: a look at just overall trades and see if
283.84s: anything sticks out to us from the
285.80s: perspective of directional plays we have
288.88s: to kill the spreads so that we're just
291.64s: looking at single legs and we can see a
295.60s: lot of the buildout is still out in 2026
298.44s: these are people speculating on longer
300.52s: term ideas which again is good to see
303.56s: because this is not GameStop being
305.96s: dominated by expectations of short-term
309.04s: price distortions this is expectation of
312.36s: GameStop as a company growing in value
315.32s: which is exactly the kind of thing that
317.60s: I want to see as an investor if we take
320.32s: a look at the options chain in the
322.40s: platform you'll notice a couple things
325.60s: the first thing is obviously we can see
327.60s: volatility is getting way way way
330.04s: elevated here in the 28 March expiration
334.00s: cycle and right now earnings is slated
337.20s: for the 25th after the close we'll see
340.96s: if it actually sticks there but right
343.80s: now that's where the market is agreeing
345.96s: it's seeing it there if we take a look
348.84s: at the total breakdown of calls to puts
352.00s: still maintaining pretty strong call
353.60s: skew not a big shift there but a ton
356.20s: take a look at this volume today 72,000
358.92s: calls against 7 1,000 puts and take a
360.96s: look at how many were bought at the ask
363.36s: or above that's a actually tremendous
365.92s: value the fact that that's
368.08s: 44% I typically would expect to see the
370.64s: 40% handle as the in between the market
374.76s: so these are absolutely people
377.48s: speculating to the upside a lot of the
380.88s: volume is in the 7 March expiration so
383.60s: if we take a look
384.84s: 28,000 of that is in 7 March and then if
387.56s: we go out to that longer term expiration
389.40s: this 16 Jan it's only 1,500 options out
393.28s: that far 21 March is about 10,000 so
397.28s: most of it is in the longer term
400.04s: expirations on a combination obviously a
402.48s: lot of it is the short-term front play
405.84s: as per usual but those are lower overall
408.52s: values if we take a look at overall
412.00s: buildout the green here tells me that
414.28s: these are net ads the contracts are
416.28s: still building out to the upside
420.32s: and a little bit same on the put side
423.20s: but again nothing too extreme here now
426.88s: the last thing I want to talk
428.64s: about is this so there's some recent
433.04s: news that relates to the store closures
438.08s: we can see that we I think we already
440.24s: talked about some of these in Ohio I
442.36s: think this article is from like the 26th
445.00s: or something like that yeah 27 Feb and
448.52s: it just talks about closing more of the
450.76s: stores which again I I think is
453.12s: everybody knows this we're trying to
455.84s: offload the stores that are not driving
459.48s: profitability which is exactly what
461.32s: should happen and you can see that
462.92s: here's uh an entire list of the stores
465.04s: so far so this is continuing to expand
467.92s: and you can see that it's not limited to
469.48s: a place like Ohio it's it's kind of
471.60s: across the board the other thing that
473.08s: was really interesting was this so
476.08s: they're talking about selling their
478.64s: International operations this came out a
481.32s: little while ago we originally discussed
484.00s: this but I think it's worth dis like
486.92s: just mentioning it in total because this
489.76s: drives the broader picture that GameStop
493.28s: is Reinventing itself it's doing what it
496.00s: needs to do to survive as a company the
498.32s: fact that it's looking for stuff like
500.44s: this the footprint that it has in Canada
503.72s: in France with Canada specifically
506.48s: representing 5% of sales they're saying
508.64s: okay well this isn't worth the
510.44s: investment we should divest from this
513.44s: and try to reallocate that money to
516.48s: where we see
517.76s: strength which again makes a lot of
521.16s: sense now the last thing I want to
523.16s: mention quick here I was looking through
524.64s: this this is kind of interesting this is
526.00s: from the street and it just shares
529.04s: analysts estimates on GameStop EPs and
532.92s: most of them are showing negative
534.76s: expectations for fiscal year
537.84s: 2425 you can see what the ranges are for
542.68s: both of those periods there are some
545.36s: that are starting to eyeball potential
549.52s: profitability is again as you can see
552.24s: expanding towards
554.52s: 2025 but these are using mean estimates
558.96s: so we'll see exactly how it lands
561.44s: because again I there's sitting on a lot
564.08s: of cash which does help but revenues are
567.44s: still Contracting so we kind of need to
570.08s: see where revenues go but one of the
572.56s: cool Parts about this is on a value
574.60s: basis you can see price to sales are
578.00s: actually starting to show a little bit
581.00s: of opportunity from like a value
582.76s: perspective so that is the current state
586.04s: of GameStop as I see it from a Trader's
588.80s: perspective as always if you guys want
590.84s: to learn more about the depth and the
592.76s: lore the dude to talk to is Richard
596.00s: Newton he's the guy to go see for all
597.52s: that stuff he knows way more about
599.56s: GameStop than I could ever even hope to
602.04s: approach so he's the guy for that kind
604.72s: of context but I aim to add a slightly
607.88s: different lens and talk about the actual
610.08s: Traders lens of stuff um as well as the
612.64s: options market so as always if you have
614.08s: any questions let me know be an outlier
615.76s: I'll see you later
