2.44s: what's up everyone welcome back to the
4.32s: outlier podcast I have a new friend with
6.56s: us this is actually the first time I'm
8.00s: having the opportunity to meet options
10.52s: with Davis but welcome to the podcast
12.08s: man thanks for coming to hang out for a
13.16s: little bit thanks for having me Eric
15.48s: very happy to be here yeah absolutely
18.08s: cool and I'm really excited to talk to
20.16s: you this is kind of one of the the
21.24s: beautiful components of um technology is
24.32s: the fact that right now you're over in
25.64s: Singapore I'm here in California and
27.52s: we're able to have a pretty low latency
29.32s: conversation which is uh really sick but
32.56s: um yeah man so typically in the
34.60s: beginning like I was telling you right
35.64s: before we started I like to just get a
37.84s: bit of background right so specifically
40.24s: I would love to hear a little bit about
42.36s: how you got interested in trading and
45.48s: then the other piece to that is how you
48.40s: got specifically interested in trading
50.84s: options because that's a uncommon
53.36s: offshoot for most of us so I thought we
55.04s: start there sure so I started trading
58.48s: sometime back in uh 20 2005 2006 uh I
62.36s: was 24 I was still in my University days
65.60s: and uh I remember going to the book
68.04s: store one day and uh I came across this
69.92s: book about Financial Freedom right so I
71.80s: was very interested so I bought the book
74.24s: and one of the vehicles that they
75.72s: mention uh is to use trading right so I
78.88s: got very interested in trading and uh
81.56s: started to get you know as many books as
83.24s: I can and remember attending this
85.16s: seminar uh whereby it was co-hosted by a
88.12s: broker and some education company
90.72s: and this education company I think was
92.24s: selling some kind of a software where
94.12s: there was this trading signal uh buy and
96.64s: sell like a bought kind of thing so I
99.88s: remember he was calling out to the
101.20s: audience to just shut out some stocks
103.52s: right so uh the audience was shutting
105.40s: out the stocks and then he would show
106.96s: the stock on his screen and show the buy
109.16s: sell signal and it was like almost every
111.84s: stock that the audience cut out it was a
114.16s: winner so I kind of thought that you
115.72s: know I had to get this bot so that was
118.20s: my first introduction to this so I
119.96s: remember it was pretty expensive
121.60s: especially I was a university student so
124.16s: I had to take up you know part-time jobs
126.16s: and I had to work extra shifts just so
128.64s: that I could you know make enough to
130.24s: afford that system and also fund my
133.16s: first account so I remember funding my
134.96s: first account uh and then trading using
137.68s: the system and of course you know it
139.52s: always works
140.68s: well uh during the presentation but
143.28s: never in real life right so what I found
145.44s: out later on is that this system kind of
147.28s: repaints right so I decided that you
150.20s: know I don't think this is the the the
152.28s: way that it should be so I started to
154.20s: dive more into trading reading other
156.68s: books and I came across this book on
158.40s: options trading and I got very
160.36s: interested and also at that point
162.60s: time uh it's I I had a few books but the
165.44s: one that really got me interested was
166.80s: get rich with options I think was by LEL
169.96s: yeah and uh yeah and because I was doing
173.60s: Finance right uh it kind of interested
176.44s: me right especially with the
177.48s: probabilities and numbers so I started
180.08s: to open an account with think of swim
183.40s: and back then they weren't bought over
186.08s: by TD marit trade yet right and uh yeah
189.24s: so I funded that account as well and uh
191.88s: I remember I was asking for lower
194.08s: commissions because back then it was
196.20s: much more expensive right they had this
197.72s: ticket fee at the start and then per L
200.00s: is cheaper so I remember I had to ask
203.04s: lower the commission and it was one of
204.84s: the founders of of think of stream back
207.32s: then that actually replied to my email I
208.72s: can't remember was it Tom SN or was it
212.12s: one of oh I see you didn't know which
213.48s: one yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so he he
216.40s: told me that he would be willing to give
218.64s: me a commission per l so I was like very
221.68s: uh happy about that very appreciative
223.20s: because it make things so much cheaper
224.84s: so I started to get into options trading
227.60s: and uh I I went to all the webinars that
231.28s: they have all many of the webinars so
233.00s: for me it was past midnight my time so I
235.24s: will stay up late just to attend their
236.68s: webinars download their training because
239.24s: options can be quite complex right
241.48s: definitely much more than outright
243.80s: trading so I started to plan my very
246.36s: first trade remember my very first trade
248.00s: was a buut spread on Google and Google
250.64s: was about back then was about $4 $500
253.84s: right so uh the first trade was winner I
256.32s: got hooked and I started to you know
258.84s: keep trading and at the point of time I
260.96s: would say that I'm doing pretty okay for
262.84s: a university student I was making maybe
264.80s: a thousand or two you know each month
267.56s: and I thought that you know this is
269.20s: something that I want to do right I'm
270.48s: going to graduate not get a job just do
272.80s: options right but of course you know
275.08s: things never turn out the way you want
276.32s: it to because I placed a trade that
279.16s: pretty much blew up my account right so
282.36s: I still remember it was on oex oex and
286.28s: uh it was the subprime crisis so the
289.24s: market had came down quite a bit it
291.48s: crashed and I put on this trade where
293.80s: the construct was about
295.76s: 99% right win rate and I thought you
299.08s: know I mean 99% to make a few hundred
301.88s: bucks in a few days you know what's the
304.44s: what could happen it's pretty much a
305.60s: done deal but you know as a Murphy's Law
308.80s: would have it anything that can go wrong
310.40s: will go wrong at the worst possible time
312.60s: so that's kind of what happened right
313.92s: the problem with that trade is that I
315.28s: pretty much reach the whole account
316.96s: because I didn't think that you know it
318.48s: was possible I kind of got overconfident
320.44s: at that point so I remember after I
322.96s: placed the trade I think it was the next
324.52s: day or so the news came out that the
326.88s: subprime crisis had spilled over to the
329.28s: euro side and I remember looking at the
331.56s: screen the market continued to tank even
333.44s: further way past my uh construct and I
337.08s: was losing a lot of money and I was like
339.16s: I I didn't accept the risk at the point
340.60s: of time which is a very big mistake so I
343.08s: panicked and I just closed out my trade
344.88s: earlier than I should and thinking I
347.00s: could save you know some money but uh
349.76s: the ironic thing was that if I held to
351.28s: exploration it would have been a it
352.80s: would have expired worthless but you
354.40s: know it could easily work out the other
356.12s: way as well where you know could have
357.52s: blown out the whole account so I
360.04s: realized that you know I didn't know as
361.52s: much about options as I thought I did
363.32s: definitely couldn't do this full time
364.72s: after I graduate so that's when I
366.76s: started to dive more about you know risk
369.04s: management learn a little bit more and
372.04s: yeah that's pretty much how I got
373.28s: started in options yeah man' I uh I
376.88s: laugh a lot because the story about your
380.28s: high probability trade that you put on
382.16s: in oex it's it's essentially the same
385.56s: thing I did in rut I had a really wide
388.68s: iron condor and I started trading a
391.60s: little bit after you actually I started
393.16s: trading in 2007 but that was the the
396.24s: largest percent draw down on my account
398.68s: and what made your story hit even closer
401.88s: to home is exactly like you I exited the
405.96s: trade it was like a 30 plus perc draw
407.96s: down on the account which is the biggest
409.40s: draw down I've ever had which better
411.44s: than some people but still like that's a
412.92s: lot of money to just evaporate and I
415.80s: closed it and I was like okay got to get
417.40s: it together and then dude it's the same
419.68s: thing it was a short-term trade and sure
421.68s: as if I just left it alone it would
423.60s: have been I'm telling you dude so it's
425.92s: so funny to hear it's like literally the
428.88s: same story we had the same exact
430.76s: experience which then leads me to be
432.92s: super eager to understand the way that
435.48s: you reacted that experience so after you
438.48s: had your you know your oh moment
441.40s: this is not going as I thought it might
443.92s: how did you react to that and then what
446.36s: did you do to navigate around it yeah so
450.12s: I realized that you know risk management
452.04s: was a very big part and that uh I had to
455.16s: really understand more about trading
457.60s: that's what I thought so the next thing
459.68s: I did was uh after I graduated I wanted
463.04s: to get a job as a Trader that's what I
465.56s: thought that you know it's the best way
468.40s: for me to learn about it you know so I
470.80s: managed to get a job at a proprietary
472.84s: trading firm and from there I learned
475.40s: even more about you know risk management
478.68s: so from from there that kind of I would
481.04s: say really gave me quite an eye opener
483.32s: as to you know how professional Traders
485.68s: really
487.04s: trade yeah so pretty much that's it
489.72s: after that I went to the prop firm did
491.68s: that for a while and then from there I
495.32s: would say the risk management part I
497.44s: kind of uh pretty much
500.76s: um kind of was able to navigate the
503.36s: market more safely compared to before
505.60s: because it it was the prop firm was very
509.32s: uh
511.16s: what is the word very sharp on risk or
513.12s: very hard on risk right if you had a
515.24s: loss limit for that day you had to
518.40s: actually stop trading close all your
521.08s: position and stop for the day right and
523.20s: the person next to you he has to also
525.72s: know that if you have the loss limit he
527.32s: has to make sure that you stop trading
529.00s: for the day and there was this uh one of
533.20s: the the the uh the thing that happened
537.04s: at the platform was the very first day
539.68s: where I was there I would say that's the
541.56s: most momentous occasion so to speak
545.04s: whereby it's not because I was it was
546.96s: the first day there but rather the
548.32s: senior Trader there actually got fired
550.56s: on the very first day I was there and
552.08s: the senior Trader had been there for
553.56s: quite a while and he was actually
555.12s: profitable but he was fired because he
557.28s: made a very big mistake whereby he let a
561.04s: losing position go way past what it
563.12s: should be so I remember that day um he
566.20s: was stuck in this position then we
568.00s: didn't know exactly what happened but
569.20s: the boss had all this screens in his uh
572.68s: room where he knows every Trader's p&l
575.68s: so what happened that day he came out of
577.24s: his room and he was just standing there
579.36s: and staring at one Trader at the end and
582.24s: it's very rare that the boss actually
583.44s: comes out of his room right so we knew
585.04s: something was not right so he was
586.20s: staring there and then he just shouted
587.60s: over to the senior Trader and just said
590.08s: something like you know when are you
591.12s: going to get out so the senior Trader
593.48s: was just saying soon he just said the
595.48s: word soon so the boss was saying okay
597.36s: you say it soon the boss went back to
599.16s: his room and a few minutes later the
602.00s: boss came out again and it was a very
604.12s: big guy big towering guy so you know you
606.56s: don't want to mess with him and he
608.12s: started to H vulgarities at the guy and
611.16s: and told him to get out of his seat get
614.40s: out of his seat and he sat in his place
616.48s: and exited his position for him so you
618.80s: know your job as a Trader is done if you
620.92s: know the boss have to sit at your seat
622.88s: exit your position for you and then the
624.92s: boss told him to you know get out that
627.00s: day so there he was that day you know I
629.56s: I was a bit shocked because he is a
631.64s: profitable Trader he had been there for
633.00s: many years but because of one mistake
634.84s: right he didn't ad her to his loss for
636.76s: the day uh he got fired and after that
640.36s: there was even this talks whereby the
642.04s: boss wanted to implement some sort of
643.80s: system whereby if you hit the loss limit
645.88s: for the day there'll be Sirens that goes
648.68s: off so that he will alert people beside
651.12s: you and those people beside him have to
652.88s: make sure that he stops trading for the
654.32s: day right but that's pretty much you
656.64s: know how uh the risk is is very
660.24s: important for the uh
662.28s: film yeah well I think that that's
664.88s: really cool too because it highlights
667.36s: obviously a very thoughtful approach to
668.92s: learn about trading right because you're
670.44s: like this is what I want to do I
672.20s: obviously need to learn more because a
674.48s: lot of people I find that get into
676.64s: trading they'll make a mistake like that
678.76s: and then they'll just somehow think
680.16s: it'll be different in the future and I
682.92s: think people sometimes forget that if
684.84s: you trade like that where you personally
687.08s: have to make every single mistake sooner
689.88s: or later you're going to blow up like
691.80s: there's only so many mistakes that you
693.28s: can get your way through but that
695.48s: experience at the prop firm is is really
697.52s: interesting to me I have two follow on
699.24s: the first one is based on that happening
701.92s: your very first day what was your
704.56s: impression what were you thinking as you
705.88s: were sitting in your desk watching this
707.28s: thing
708.08s: happen yeah that I better not have the
711.00s: same thing happen to me otherwise I'm
712.80s: going to get fired but the funny thing
715.16s: was that uh later on after I got my
718.28s: account so when we started started off
719.56s: we won't have our own account right we
720.88s: have to trade the company's account we
722.36s: have to show and prove that we are
724.24s: consistent before we get the account so
726.28s: after I got my account I think it was
727.76s: only just the beginning few months I got
730.80s: into a very similar position as that
732.72s: senior Trader and St away I remember oh
735.68s: oh I better you know stop trading for
738.08s: the day so once I had the uh loss limit
741.08s: hit for the day I I quickly close my
743.68s: trade so one thing also is that my
745.20s: mentor so every Junior Trader there
748.72s: always have senior Traders kind of like
750.72s: overlooking them so my mentor was uh
753.40s: this senior Trader who was very good at
755.76s: risk as well so I learned quite a bit
757.24s: from him so once this loss limit hit for
760.68s: me I remember I had to close up my trade
763.56s: uh immediately and then uh I went
766.16s: straight to the boss's room instead of
767.72s: waiting for him to come to me I went to
769.84s: him so I went to him and then I told him
772.44s: that uh boss I hit the loss limit for
774.76s: the day so I'm here so I remember the
777.72s: boss was saying something to me like you
780.28s: know uh I'm glad you came I was actually
783.80s: wondering when you would come to me so
786.24s: you know I was a s of relief because he
788.28s: was waiting so then he asked me could
791.32s: you have done anything could you have
793.60s: done it better so I thought to myself
796.00s: like you know that is a question I'm not
797.80s: sure is it a test or you know to see my
800.04s: honesty so I thought to myself you know
802.08s: no point you know you know smoking him
805.40s: so I told him that yes I could have done
808.00s: better if I could have exited at Market
811.08s: but instead I didn't want to exit the
812.44s: market I wanted to queue uh in order to
815.36s: get a lesser loss but I had a plan right
817.80s: if it didn't you know take me out at my
820.76s: limit order I would just cut so it went
823.92s: you know further south so I cut it and I
826.52s: told my boss that you know I didn't want
828.32s: to you know I could have cut off earlier
830.64s: but I didn't because I didn't want to
832.40s: lose that much but with that said I did
834.48s: try to cut off after that so the boss
835.88s: said you know I'm glad you make that
837.36s: decision because uh I'm still waiting
839.56s: for the other traders to come in so he
841.20s: showed me on his screen that there were
842.36s: other people in the same position so I
844.32s: didn't feel that bad after that so then
846.44s: on he went on to say that you know you
847.68s: will have days like this and that uh
850.84s: managing it like this right now will
852.48s: help you in the long term and then he
854.68s: proceeded to say you know stop trading
856.08s: for the day but you can watch a movie so
858.96s: in the prop firm you have one screen
860.44s: that you could you know you don't have
861.72s: to trade you can just relax so yeah
865.36s: pretty much that's how I I kind of
867.48s: handled the risk after that yeah that's
869.88s: that's massive and what a great
871.40s: infrastructure too because that really
874.28s: promotes what like just a great
876.52s: environment to learn in that you weren't
878.36s: punished for going to him you were
880.56s: essentially rewarded and I think that
882.92s: that gives you like massive positive
885.36s: reinforcement to make hard decisions
887.76s: it's like a big thing that we do in the
889.28s: military in as well is in the in the
892.28s: military make tons of really difficult
894.16s: decisions and a lot of them they all
896.44s: have bad outcomes it's just like which
898.16s: is the better bad outcome for me and if
901.16s: you have really good leadership that
903.28s: will help you acknowledge the fact that
905.80s: yeah like this was a bad outcome it was
907.32s: going to be bad but you made the right
909.28s: decision with what you had like that's
911.12s: massively massively influential I could
912.84s: see how positive that could be on your
914.40s: longer term tradeing career how long did
916.72s: you stay at the prop firm for and what
920.20s: was some of the the bigger pieces that
922.88s: you took away Beyond risk management
924.64s: while you were
926.04s: there I was there about I a total about
929.12s: four years or so and the biggest
933.04s: pieces um I would say would be really
937.48s: really only the incidence about uh
940.64s: managing risk right because the way that
943.60s: we trade uh it's pretty straightforward
946.56s: and that you know profits will come
949.28s: right profits are always smaller than
950.80s: the losses so the losses will always be
953.68s: something that you need to know how to
955.16s: manage and also being very honest with
957.88s: yourself that's one thing I I found out
960.16s: because a lot of time people might you
962.16s: know tell the some certain stories to
964.56s: make themselves feel better so one of
967.04s: the other thing that happened at the
968.96s: platform was there was another Trader
970.52s: that joined around the same time as
972.84s: me uh what happened was that he also got
976.52s: fired but for another reason because he
980.24s: had a losing stock that he had a very
983.96s: big loss on but on his screen you know
986.68s: we would have all the stocks where we
988.00s: shown on our screen
989.48s: but the boss one day came out of his
991.44s: room at the end of the training day and
994.00s: went over to his screen and he was not
995.76s: at his screen so he took look at took a
998.04s: look at his screen and couldn't find the
1000.16s: stock that was losing a lot of money
1001.96s: because on his end on his RIS uh monitor
1005.68s: he saw that this Trader had a huge loss
1007.88s: on a particular stock and for us we
1009.80s: usually put all the stock on the screen
1011.16s: so the boss can actually see it but on
1013.20s: his screen the stock was missing so he
1015.00s: was wondering what's happening so he's
1016.32s: asking the tech team is there something
1018.00s: wrong with this risk monitor only later
1020.80s: on to find out that this Trader actually
1023.28s: removed the stock from the screen to
1025.52s: show that you know everything is nice
1028.64s: and uh because of that the boss you know
1030.96s: fired him because he was like painting a
1034.24s: picture like you know not really being
1036.72s: honest with himself so I trust from that
1039.00s: day on yeah I kind of felt that you know
1041.24s: the first thing is always to be really
1043.00s: honors and risk management yeah yeah
1046.32s: that makes a lot of sense it's man it's
1048.24s: so funny to you think about like what a
1050.16s: juvenile move on that person's behalf as
1052.64s: if the dude can't see it in the office
1055.00s: right like the dude can see the accounts
1056.88s: so it's just yeah that's I could totally
1059.20s: see why he would fire him um so you were
1063.36s: prop firm Trader for four
1065.16s: years and when you made the transition
1068.64s: after that what was
1070.84s: next yeah so after that I started to do
1074.48s: trading on my own uh pretty much yeah
1077.88s: all the way on my own I did yeah the
1080.64s: transition was um quite tough I would
1083.52s: say in a sense because starting off you
1084.80s: were trading with the firm's money right
1087.80s: and uh even though it was a loss it was
1090.92s: still the loss of the firm but when you
1093.04s: start to trade on your own right the
1095.32s: loss affects you much much much more
1097.72s: especially psychologically so during
1099.80s: that time although you know I you know
1101.80s: build up quite a sizable Capital back
1104.08s: then also because of the profits I made
1106.52s: from The Firm but uh also
1109.32s: I went to do some you know like a s
1111.56s: hustle kind of thing so at least I still
1113.64s: have you know I'm not fully reliant on
1116.40s: uh just options trading but yeah after
1118.92s: that I did that for a while I grew my
1120.36s: confident my account size gradually
1122.68s: grew talk to me about talk to me about
1126.28s: like the tools that you took from prop
1129.00s: trading into your own
1132.00s: trading Yeah so basically uh one thing I
1135.72s: found about prop trading when I was
1138.04s: there is that no body really uses
1139.88s: technical
1140.96s: analysis there was no talk about Head
1143.68s: and Shoulders pattern no Candlestick no
1146.00s: it's all about looking at price price
1148.48s: levels so that's how I kind of took my
1151.20s: Approach uh in options trading whereby
1153.52s: you know instead of looking at all this
1155.36s: technical analysis stuff uh more towards
1158.72s: price levels and then just using the
1161.76s: probabilities to play out to trade and
1164.88s: the other thing is also looking at risk
1166.76s: first so a lot of time you know what I
1170.04s: found out especially to some my YouTube
1172.80s: audience where they email me a lot of
1174.84s: times they focus on you know what they
1177.08s: want to make first right the premium to
1179.84s: receive and they decide their position
1181.80s: size based on how much they want to make
1184.88s: and they don't really look at you know
1186.56s: the risk so uh I would take the opposite
1190.80s: approach I would look at risk first
1193.08s: rather than you know the see how much
1195.48s: you make yeah yeah yeah that's abs
1198.68s: abolutely awesome it's it's funny too
1200.92s: because that's just so common for all of
1202.96s: us I mean think about even you know one
1204.84s: of the first books you read that got you
1206.44s: interested in options trading right get
1208.48s: rich with options or trading options
1210.92s: right it's like obviously we're focusing
1212.52s: on that part um that that's huge I think
1216.36s: so focusing on the the risk side is a
1218.60s: big part talk to me in terms of the
1221.36s: specific strategies you would use from
1223.52s: prop trading into personal trading and
1226.12s: like the specific products so obviously
1228.04s: you're analy more so just through price
1230.88s: levels and you're using the options
1232.80s: chains themselves to decipher
1234.92s: probabilities and things like that um
1237.48s: talk to me about like strategies in
1239.88s: products yeah so the strategies that I'm
1242.60s: trading in my portfolio are a number of
1246.08s: strategies right I would say I would
1247.52s: group them between uh growth and income
1250.88s: so growth strategies are more like you
1252.28s: know leaps slightly more longer term I
1254.28s: would even categorize a will strategy
1256.28s: also uh growth plus income because
1258.64s: because when I get a sign on the stock I
1261.44s: actually hold them rather than
1262.72s: immediately sell the cover call right so
1264.76s: I'll hold them until it goes up before I
1266.80s: sawell the cover call and then for the
1268.64s: income side I would have strategies like
1270.48s: strangles you know jet lizards ratio
1273.28s: spreads and
1275.76s: butterflies yeah got it and so talk to
1279.84s: me about how you split your portfolio
1282.00s: between those to yeah so generally it's
1285.40s: more towards growth just because of the
1289.48s: size of the underlyings that I'm trading
1291.24s: so they're much more expensive so in
1293.00s: order for you to get ass sign you do
1294.44s: need more Capital so I put much more to
1296.64s: it there 60 plus percent and then uh to
1300.20s: the income site uh the remainder got it
1304.28s: and when you're trading stuff like the
1306.16s: wheel for example um I have a a bunch of
1310.00s: material because I I trade a slight
1313.08s: variant of it's called a coverage
1314.40s: strangle so it's similar in context but
1317.28s: a slightly different
1319.20s: methodology um talk to me about the way
1322.12s: that you run the wheels specifically you
1324.04s: were talking about one part that I've
1326.76s: want to hone in on which was that when
1329.24s: you take assignment that you obviously
1331.32s: try to wait for it to show a profit
1333.84s: before you know you either sell calls or
1335.76s: take your exit how do you manage
1338.60s: something where you're trading the wheel
1340.00s: in you sell your short putut you get
1342.40s: aigns and then the underly just
1344.52s: continues down sure so this back in uh
1349.72s: the CO as well as 2022 so first of all
1352.72s: when I choose the underlines for the
1354.16s: wheel strategy uh for me I tend to
1356.48s: choose what I think are fundamentally
1358.36s: sound companies that means I do not mind
1360.28s: actually holding them for the long term
1362.56s: so these are companies where you know
1364.84s: they are profitable and uh you know at
1368.72s: least they have been around for a number
1370.28s: of years right I want to see that they
1371.84s: have at least survive some of the major
1374.08s: crashes like for example financial
1375.84s: crisis 20072 2008 and even pandemic so
1380.76s: uh these are the stocks that I generally
1383.12s: tend to choose and then I will take a
1385.24s: look at the valuation right so there are
1388.88s: many sites for this right so I'll just
1390.64s: go to the sites and out of the
1392.76s: valuations I'll just kind of pick the
1394.32s: most conservative one and that's where
1396.84s: I'll start to plan getting into the
1398.32s: wheels so the way I trade the wheels
1399.84s: slightly maybe different than the
1401.92s: conventional way of trading bill whereby
1404.76s: I would have an allocation to the stock
1407.92s: uh like if I want to allocate to this
1410.12s: stock maybe I can put on say based on my
1412.48s: size I can put on four cash output for
1415.52s: example but instead of going all four
1417.68s: cash secure put at one level what I'll
1419.32s: do is that I will stagger in the entries
1421.32s: so I enter them in trenches so I'll
1423.52s: enter them below the valuation and then
1426.48s: I'll split them up into the you know
1428.92s: four different so this way as the market
1431.12s: goes down right at least you know I
1433.80s: wouldn't all be hit all at once right so
1436.64s: if I had hit all at once then I I'll be
1438.64s: holding on to the stock for a long time
1440.12s: because I may not even be able to sell a
1441.72s: covered call because it'll be way below
1443.28s: entry price so instead I'll stagger them
1445.64s: down so if the market comes down I will
1447.44s: get to the next cash cput uh and then so
1450.88s: on and so forth and then finally when it
1453.04s: goes back up uh I would sell the cover
1455.76s: call usually above where the valuation
1459.08s: line is so let's say if I think the
1461.28s: valuation is at a certain level I will
1463.04s: wait until it goes above that especially
1464.64s: I had a sign on quite a number below
1466.80s: that so that would have quite a bit of a
1468.64s: capital gain on the way up and then I
1470.48s: would stagger my cover call on the way
1472.68s: up as well so then how do you navigate
1476.64s: the opportunity cost associated with
1478.64s: that kind of strategy where the covid
1480.64s: market was really accommodating it was
1482.52s: like a three-day bare Market before we
1484.20s: started that crazy rally out so if you
1487.28s: have a stock you staggered your short
1489.44s: puts you start getting hit you're
1491.20s: assigned you're assigned you're assigned
1493.28s: so is there is there a point at which
1495.80s: you're like okay I've been in this thing
1497.40s: for six months and I'm still super far
1500.16s: underwater do you manage the loss by
1503.72s: time or by other price levels or is it
1506.60s: literally just I still think this is a
1508.32s: fundamentally sound company I don't care
1510.32s: how long I have to wait yeah I take the
1513.08s: appro whereby I'm into this for the long
1515.68s: term so I do not trade it more of a
1517.72s: short term whereby I try to get a
1519.32s: covered call at the entry price I kind
1522.20s: of wait until it goes up so if I have a
1524.52s: firm belief in the stock then I would
1526.56s: just wait for it to eventually come back
1529.52s: and then is there a condition that would
1531.76s: make you not believe in the stock
1534.68s: anymore yeah so that is if some changes
1538.44s: happen to the company structure and I'm
1541.52s: not very uh sure of the outcome then I I
1545.76s: might just take the loss and exit but so
1547.72s: far uh it hasn't I haven't done anything
1550.68s: like that so far and also most of the
1553.12s: underlines that I choose tend to be very
1555.28s: big cap stocks uh in a sense whereby you
1558.72s: know they are kind of widely traded so
1561.08s: it's not like uh very you know lower
1564.28s: price stocks where you know it's
1566.76s: uncertain or it's or it's not
1568.96s: profitable yeah got it because that's
1571.28s: always been one of my Fascinations with
1573.04s: stuff like the wheel is because I
1574.64s: noticed a lot of people who like to
1576.40s: trade it they'll essentially run it very
1579.28s: similar in that sense where they'll kind
1580.68s: of just wait and then that circles me
1583.64s: back then to the original thought of how
1585.76s: do you navigate then the opportunity C
1588.48s: of that
1589.48s: Capital yeah very good question so this
1592.88s: is something that also I've been
1594.20s: thinking about but uh basically I will
1596.64s: Puck them into fixed income securities
1600.36s: right so what I'll do is that in my own
1602.20s: bank I would put them into fixed income
1604.20s: Security First and when the need arises
1606.24s: for me to actually get to the next level
1609.08s: then I will actually transfer it now may
1611.28s: not be that efficient uh but recently
1614.44s: I've been speaking with some people and
1615.88s: they talk about using like money market
1617.96s: fund funds so that could be an
1620.32s: alternative whereby you par on money in
1622.16s: the market uh money funds but I do have
1624.20s: some in t bills as well but T bills
1626.60s: aren't as liquid because you have to
1628.20s: wait until it you know kind of uh
1631.12s: matures before you can use the funds
1633.56s: have you tinkered with box
1635.96s: spreads uh no I haven't it's exactly
1638.92s: what I use so are you familiar with the
1641.20s: coverage
1642.20s: strangle yes yeah okay so it's
1645.16s: essentially almost same process as the
1647.96s: we
1648.92s: the primary difference is as I'm
1650.68s: assigned I'm typically selling more cash
1652.64s: secured puts and then I almost will
1654.76s: always sell the calls at a ratio so that
1657.32s: I don't cap my upside potential but to
1660.40s: the same point and it it's actually
1662.20s: fascinating talking to you to be honest
1663.84s: because there's so many parallels I find
1666.16s: this every time I talk to traders that
1667.52s: have been trading for a while it's like
1668.88s: we we do the same way like there's
1671.12s: small differences but it's like the same
1673.24s: stuff it's hilarious um but when I'm
1676.08s: trading something like the coverage
1677.16s: strangle I'll have the same idea I'll
1679.48s: have a certain amount of allocation
1681.20s: that's ready to go to it but any of that
1683.36s: money that's not being used that's
1685.08s: allocated to the trade I'll put it in a
1686.56s: box spread so it's a way for me to earn
1689.20s: a slight premium over the risk-free rate
1692.16s: for whatever duration I put it in and i'
1694.28s: use something like SPX to run those so
1697.08s: it's also section well in the US section
1700.20s: 1256 tax code so 640 long-term
1703.32s: short-term capital gains there's no
1705.20s: early exercise European style option and
1707.32s: you can always exit it early if you have
1708.96s: to but yeah that just might be something
1711.72s: worth because if you're talking about
1713.16s: like T bills money market you'll make
1714.92s: more spread for sure that's interesting
1717.84s: so uh that means if you let's say you
1720.44s: set aside a certain amount of money for
1721.88s: the stock and if you have unused portion
1724.96s: you use that unused buying power to put
1728.04s: into this covered strangle on the SPX is
1731.16s: that correct the Box spread yeah ah okay
1735.04s: and uh what if there's a loss wouldn't
1738.32s: that eat into the amount that you need
1740.00s: to put into the it's so if you put the
1743.00s: trade on as you should it's impossible
1744.64s: for it to be a
1745.96s: loss for a coverage strangle no for the
1749.48s: Box spread for the Box spread so the
1751.68s: coverage strangle will have whatever
1753.84s: variance it has again you can okay okay
1756.64s: okay got it got it got it yeah because I
1760.40s: I run box spreads almost all the time
1762.20s: with unused capital in the account um
1764.72s: just because you you earn a slight
1767.04s: excess over the RIS free rate so for
1769.64s: example right now I'm running one that's
1773.24s: giving me
1775.24s: 0.71% over the risk-free rate for the
1777.84s: corresponding time frame that I'm in so
1779.48s: it's you're not like out there rolling
1781.08s: in money right it's not crazy but that
1783.76s: is still almost three qus of a point of
1787.48s: excess that I get over doing something
1789.16s: like short-term T bills or stuff like
1790.76s: that yeah definitely have to look into
1793.00s: that yeah I think that's pretty yeah
1795.64s: dude well anytime if you want to set up
1798.12s: a call otherwise you know you know I can
1799.36s: just a little bit but I'd be
1800.96s: happy to walk you through what I do with
1802.60s: them I just find them when I'm trading
1804.36s: something like the coverage triangle
1805.48s: which is really Capital intensive it's
1807.28s: kind of a way for me to to triple dip
1809.32s: almost so that I can be a little bit
1812.24s: leaner so it sounded like you're working
1814.84s: down the same path that's why um I offer
1817.36s: that up when you look across your
1819.88s: different strategies what do you tend to
1822.72s: use the
1824.76s: most uh you mean place the traits most
1828.28s: often or you mean the
1830.72s: allocation amount I can't tell you how
1833.92s: much I love that clarifying question
1836.08s: because I'm not kidding it's the exact
1837.84s: clarifying question I would ask uh but
1840.44s: the first one would just be the the bulk
1842.52s: of the capital which I'm assuming are
1844.68s: just the more Capital intensive
1846.04s: strategies but we'll start with that
1847.36s: corre yeah correct yeah so the more
1849.36s: Capital intensive strategies are the
1850.80s: lips and the wheel strategies but the
1852.76s: one that I I do more often is generally
1855.20s: the income one because they're generally
1857.12s: a shorter
1858.48s: time time frame trade so those cycle
1861.32s: much faster so you you take them off and
1863.44s: put it on much much more often got it
1867.28s: and then talk to me then about frequency
1870.00s: which strategy do you tend to cycle in
1872.00s: and out of a
1873.08s: lot yeah so there are two types of uh
1877.24s: style of strategies that I use in terms
1878.80s: of income so one of the type of
1880.24s: strategies I would use on cash settle
1882.20s: and I'll kind of hold them towards
1884.24s: expiration so these are traits like you
1886.56s: know uh the broken wing butterfly and uh
1891.00s: mainly because you know they are very
1893.28s: slow spreads in a sense so if you were
1896.28s: to you know exit at 21 DT like based on
1898.72s: what the uh tasty trade mechanics are if
1902.32s: it gets inside you know the tent uh
1905.04s: chances are that the profit will be very
1906.96s: minimal because it's a very slow spread
1908.68s: you w kind of realize the potential of
1912.04s: that tent The Profit until close to
1914.68s: expiration then the other type will be
1916.28s: on the uh like strangles and uh J liards
1920.48s: these are more towards uh 45 days around
1924.52s: there and then I'll exit latest at 21
1928.12s: DTE right otherwi I'll take profit
1930.48s: around 50 yeah okay so you you kind of
1933.32s: mirror tasty mechanics correct tasty
1936.84s: mechanics yeah got it okay now when you
1941.60s: first were working in the prop firm what
1945.04s: kind of strategies were they having you
1946.64s: use there yeah so the problem I was in
1949.60s: we were only trading equities so it was
1952.20s: not on options because uh uh I wasn't at
1955.68s: least aware of any options PL at least
1957.88s: at that point in time in my country but
1959.64s: maybe there were but there weren't the
1961.80s: openings because platforms are very you
1964.32s: know the jobs are very sort of one once
1966.64s: it's open there people will take it up
1968.60s: so we were doing equities so the style
1971.16s: of training at the pl fir was very
1972.96s: Market maker style of trading where we
1975.36s: would be on every you know level every
1977.88s: be an ass level and we'll be basically
1980.64s: just scalping the spread so um yeah so
1985.00s: it's it's very fast in and out kind of
1988.08s: strategy so we are basically managing
1990.36s: the Q system so to speak so for example
1993.60s: if I was to queue on the bid I will be
1996.12s: the last position until you know the
1998.40s: people in front of me would get filled
2000.48s: then it would be my turn so all we're
2002.24s: doing is just managing the queue
2003.56s: position and we will be on all the
2006.20s: levels all right right yeah which funny
2010.12s: enough I I find it interesting that so
2012.40s: many retail Traders think when they
2014.52s: transition that they'll be able to
2016.36s: essentially try to provide markets like
2018.92s: that can you talk about some of the
2021.08s: reasons why you don't do that now and
2022.92s: you've migrated over to
2024.56s: options yeah so the way the prop fir
2027.48s: traded uh was
2029.44s: actually to set things up is a little
2031.68s: bit difficult because firstly to set up
2034.00s: with the broker you need a very large
2035.56s: Capital they are looking at at least at
2038.00s: least at a point of time maybe I think
2040.04s: about a few million one two million to
2042.40s: to start things up as a startup capital
2044.48s: and the software which we use is
2045.92s: actually uh customized I'm not say
2048.20s: customized it's built from scratch by
2049.92s: the software team so the platform which
2052.24s: I was at we had a team of software
2054.28s: Engineers to do it and you need to set
2056.76s: up the server at least from what I
2058.76s: understood you need to have the server
2060.80s: you know just beside the exchange so the
2063.20s: whole setup itself was too expensive for
2065.64s: a retail person one person to do it yeah
2070.04s: so uh you couldn't exactly do it on your
2073.04s: on your own even though you wanted to
2074.76s: but now I'm not too sure whether it's
2076.28s: possible because the other thing we also
2078.12s: need is level three I'm not too sure
2080.72s: whether level three is accessible for
2083.40s: retail Traders at least it wasn't back
2085.12s: then whereby you could you know level
2087.20s: one is the inside B ass level two is the
2089.72s: other levels level three uh you get to
2092.68s: see the actual breakdown of the orders
2095.28s: on the level so at least I will know you
2097.40s: know let's say if an order is about say
2099.92s: 50,000 shares I would know whether this
2102.40s: 50,000 shares through level three is it
2104.68s: one person or is it maybe 20 people
2108.04s: right so with that we are able to you
2110.84s: know manage our queue positions much
2112.96s: better our orders better because if you
2114.80s: just see level two you're in the blind
2117.48s: you have no idea what's going on whether
2119.36s: it's a spoof or is it you know because
2122.20s: this sty training a lot of manipulation
2124.44s: a lot of spoofing so level three really
2127.04s: is needed for you to trade this strategy
2129.64s: very efficiently yeah yeah and then also
2133.60s: another add-on for that talk about like
2135.44s: the friction via commissions like the
2137.88s: cost to actually transact because I
2139.80s: think that's important to highlight yeah
2141.84s: that's that's a very big one I smell
2143.36s: because with the uh uh prop firm because
2146.32s: of the size which they have they're able
2148.12s: to get you know very little commissions
2150.40s: especially in and out right but as a
2153.04s: retail Trader I don't think you can at
2154.88s: least back back then now it's it's all
2157.20s: Commission free you trade stocks right
2159.76s: trade shares but back then it was a very
2162.08s: big thing right to have very
2164.68s: verys well and and the other thing on
2166.80s: top of that is what I try to remind
2168.44s: retail Traders now is like it might look
2170.48s: like it's free because to your point
2171.92s: there's no cost up front but your orders
2173.60s: being routed via payment for order flow
2175.88s: so your ability then to rest orders on
2178.04s: multiple markets is essentially
2180.00s: relegated to who they choose to bundle
2181.96s: your order with so then you kind of get
2184.40s: broken off that way um that's
2187.12s: fascinating so when you look at your
2190.68s: trading career so
2192.20s: far what's been kind of your average
2195.72s: return that you've been able to sustain
2197.56s: through your
2198.88s: approach yeah the average roly is around
2201.68s: 20% right 20 plus% so far this year is
2205.52s: slightly better at least as of this
2207.24s: point is about 24% but mainly because
2209.84s: the market has has gone up so because I
2213.16s: have you know a big portfolio towards a
2215.80s: bigger allocation towards more of like
2218.00s: the leaps and wheel strategy whereby you
2220.12s: know if the market goes up it tends to
2221.72s: do well so these are the times where it
2223.76s: tends to do better it's funny to hear
2227.44s: you say that because my compound annual
2230.24s: growth rate from when I started is very
2232.52s: similar to that it's slightly higher end
2234.88s: of the 20s but that's mostly because it
2237.60s: got skewed from last year I had my first
2240.36s: like really strong year last year but
2243.08s: before that it was always low 20s so I'm
2245.44s: realizing that essentially you're my
2247.52s: Singaporean brother and I think
2250.16s: essentially we just do the same um
2253.08s: and I did the military as well so yeah
2255.24s: see dude I'm telling you I could just
2257.24s: tell I just the the vibe check is there
2259.96s: and based on the way that you talk about
2261.40s: this stuff um so talk to me now a little
2265.56s: bit about how your approach has evolved
2268.08s: over time because obviously going
2270.44s: through the prop firm you have your
2272.04s: basic experience then you get out you
2274.16s: decide to trade for yourself walk me
2276.20s: through that point specifically when you
2277.88s: started trading for yourself and how
2279.76s: your approach to markets has evolved
2282.20s: from there from that point till now sure
2285.56s: so when I started off uh it was much
2287.92s: more at that point just focusing on one
2290.76s: specific strategy rather than looking on
2293.04s: a more holistic view so back then I
2295.40s: tried to just one strategy all the time
2298.32s: and that you know had this limitations
2300.64s: because the strategies don't work under
2302.72s: all different conditions right so
2304.88s: there'll be times whereby uh it doesn't
2307.16s: do well so right now I have uh uh
2310.56s: positions whereby you know different
2313.00s: positions will do well under different
2314.80s: market conditions so if the market tends
2316.56s: to go all the way up that's where you
2318.48s: know I would say like what I call
2320.60s: positive Delta strategies they tend to
2322.32s: do well as the market goes up then I do
2324.32s: put on some strategies where it's more
2325.88s: neutral but if the market just goes
2327.92s: sideways then that's where the positions
2329.80s: will do well and then slightly semi
2332.60s: bearish strategies like for example the
2334.96s: uh put broken wing butterfly put ratio
2337.60s: spreads uh if you shift the 10 much much
2340.36s: lower so this is where you know if the
2342.44s: market does you know take a deep at
2345.24s: least it can have a opportunity to get
2347.44s: into the uh Zone uh the profit zone so
2351.08s: right now it's much more you know where
2353.92s: I try to have positions to kind of uh
2357.92s: you know cover where the market uh could
2360.32s: go rather than just one singular
2362.28s: strategy got it and how many positions
2365.28s: do you typically have on in your book at
2367.00s: a given point in time oh can be quite a
2370.44s: bit so is this uh you're talking about
2372.56s: the whole portfolio as a whole
2373.96s: everything
2375.72s: yeah it can be about 30 to to 50
2380.36s: depending on how volatile it The Bu of
2382.48s: it the most position would generally be
2384.36s: the the income sign right got it the
2389.68s: next question after that is how old are
2392.64s: you
2393.60s: now sorry how old you 42
2398.44s: so the next question which is what I
2400.40s: imagine based on your your time frame
2402.24s: starting is how the have you
2404.76s: managed to reverse age because I'm 33
2409.24s: and you literally look 10 years younger
2410.96s: than me which is complete
2414.36s:  I guess uh I have no idea for
2417.36s: that but maybe good jeans and maybe
2419.76s: Asians kind of look I don't know maybe I
2422.96s: kind of look maybe younger than yeah we
2425.36s: could call it Spade to spay man like
2427.00s: white dudes we age the worst we have the
2430.08s: genetics that make us look 60 by the
2432.40s: time we're 35 I'm close to it so I was
2435.08s: just curious because I feel like I'm
2436.24s: talking to a Immortal dude it
2437.80s: was freaking me out a little
2439.72s: bit um the next question though with
2442.92s: respect to the portfolio is what kind of
2445.04s: time frames do you like to
2447.64s: trade time frames in in what sense you
2450.44s: mean that for DT for your positions oh
2453.08s: okay yeah so for the DTs is different
2455.80s: for the wheel the liap and the income s
2459.20s: of strategies so for the income style of
2461.44s: strategies like I mentioned U it's
2463.80s: according to the tasty trades mechanic
2466.80s: right so they did a study where they
2468.68s: show that you know the expected move has
2472.44s: an edge over the you know the realized
2474.44s: move is often time lesser than the
2475.92s: expected move if you go for around 45
2478.48s: days and above so usually that's the
2480.56s: time frame I stick to for the income
2483.24s: style strategy now for the lips this
2486.08s: will be go I go much further out right
2488.92s: so this would be over a year in terms of
2492.16s: DTE yeah and uh for the wheel strategy
2495.60s: this will be slightly shorter time frame
2497.40s: so I could go for something like maybe a
2499.32s: week to a week that kind of time frame
2501.48s: because I actually do want to get assign
2503.96s: on the positions right because sometimes
2506.68s: the market could come down touch your
2509.28s: cash cput and then it just shoots all
2511.12s: the way back up doesn't come back down
2513.28s: then in that case if you actually had
2514.68s: just gotten fied you would have done
2516.36s: better in in capital gains term rather
2518.20s: than just get that premium so I tend to
2519.88s: go for a shorter time frame for the
2521.76s: wheel strategy yeah I I totally see that
2524.56s: and for something like the wheel
2526.04s: strategy I imagine you're probably a
2527.44s: little more aggressive on your short
2528.76s: putut Deltas to increase probability of
2530.96s: assignment correct correct because I do
2533.84s: have many levels yeah so I tend to have
2536.80s: higher Deltas right at times could even
2538.52s: be at the money well the yeah and the
2541.76s: reason why I asked that is again because
2543.52s: there's so many people that I talked to
2545.44s: that trade the wheel and I feel like so
2547.96s: many of them it up terribly because
2550.64s: they want to sell puts at like 30 Deltas
2553.28s: 20 Deltas something that obviously is a
2555.32s: high probability of winning but then
2556.76s: they don't get the underlying and then
2558.40s: that exact scenario happens that you're
2559.88s: talking about where they're bullish
2562.08s: holding something with defined profit
2564.88s: watching the thing they're bullish in
2566.40s: just go to the moon and they're just
2567.80s: like wow that looks cool I'm going to
2569.60s: take my $1 that I collected and go screw
2573.48s: myself because that's about what I get
2575.36s: here um
2577.88s: when you think about the way that you
2580.80s: manage your
2582.20s: portfolio you sound you were talking
2584.48s: about your Deltas so it sounds like
2585.76s: you're using like beta weighted Deltas
2587.48s: to some capacity and then it sounds like
2590.20s: you're using some different strategies
2592.08s: you're using some different time frames
2594.80s: do you have any sort of portfolio level
2597.76s: mandate with respect to risk so kind of
2600.72s: like your time at the prop firm if your
2602.68s: total portfolio exceeds a certain
2605.16s: percent draw down you do something about
2608.12s: it so I don't really look too much in
2611.36s: terms of draw down in uh but rather I
2614.36s: manage it up front through the maximum
2617.92s: uh usage of the capital allocation so
2620.52s: that means I try not to go past 50% so
2623.40s: if I do not have more than 50% invested
2626.16s: at any one time then I know that you
2627.96s: know the draw down uh will can be kept
2630.64s: within that and also like some of the
2633.36s: management of the strategies I tend to
2635.40s: exit at 21 DTE if that's the longest if
2638.96s: it's a loss so this way you know the
2641.48s: loss also kind of get reduced to what it
2644.40s: could be if you hold on to much longer
2646.96s: so the tasty trade guys also I I lean a
2649.80s: lot on them studies right because you
2652.24s: can see the statistics back decades and
2655.92s: uh they did many pieces on 21 DTE
2658.32s: whereby if you manage it at that point
2660.20s: then the chances of you actually you
2661.68s: know losing the actual buying power that
2664.48s: you put on for the trade has been
2666.20s: reduced a lot especially you know if you
2668.40s: trade the indices as opposed to
2670.60s: individual stocks so in that sense
2672.20s: that's how I kind of uh manage the risk
2674.20s: on a portfolio level I see yeah and then
2678.12s: just a couple other questions when
2680.32s: you're trading these different
2681.56s: strategies obviously you're probably
2683.32s: looking at some different Securities and
2686.32s: stuff that you like to trade but what do
2688.68s: you tend towards you were talking about
2690.16s: larger cap or even Mega cap style stocks
2693.80s: um but yeah what are some of the things
2695.28s: that you'd like to to put positions on
2696.80s: in
2698.04s: yeah like right now I have Google meta
2701.24s: Adobe Amazon and I do have some smaller
2705.20s: speculative positions in
2707.08s: paleno but yeah so you really you like
2711.04s: kind of the the tech side right now it
2713.12s: seems yeah yeah and then do you spend
2717.44s: any time playing with other sectors like
2719.96s: when they're in favor or do you kind of
2721.84s: stick to that same book of products that
2724.52s: you
2725.44s: like uh I tend to stick to this this
2729.00s: products they like yeah because for me
2731.68s: uh I I can't really go towards uh
2734.56s: dividend stocks in a sense because they
2737.44s: are tax at the maximum rate for me as a
2740.92s: outside of us so it doesn't really make
2743.20s: sense for me to go more for like
2744.68s: dividend stocks kind of uh for the wheel
2747.44s: so I go for stocks where they don't
2749.44s: actually pay a dividend right although
2751.48s: Google recently just did yeah but uh so
2754.84s: this way in terms of uh the the move M
2757.28s: at least the the tech side would not
2759.36s: have the dividend to kind of like soften
2761.04s: the kind of the return yeah I see yeah
2764.16s: man dude absolutely awesome I got to say
2767.08s: thank you for hopping on it's been
2769.24s: really really neat having a chance to
2771.24s: learn a little bit about your background
2773.20s: the way I typically find people for the
2774.88s: podcast is like different people from my
2776.72s: community they'll be like hey can you go
2778.24s: talk to this person so obviously
2780.60s: somebody wanted to learn a little bit
2782.52s: more about you um and I'm I'm honestly
2786.52s: really enjoying learning a little bit
2788.52s: about the way you think about markets
2790.08s: and stuff there's a lot of parallels
2791.48s: which is kind of fun so definitely would
2793.20s: love to you know have another
2794.56s: conversation at some point but in the
2796.56s: meantime for people that want to get a
2799.32s: hold of you where would you like them to
2801.84s: go and then I can throw those links also
2804.28s: in the notes below sure just to my
2807.48s: YouTube channel or to options withth
2810.60s: davis.com got it easy then yeah man I
2813.52s: definitely would love to keep in touch
2815.04s: and then maybe we can even do like a
2816.32s: live stream or something sometime I
2817.84s: think that would be a lot of fun I love
2819.12s: interacting with the community's lives
2820.84s: so that would be a blast but thanks for
2822.92s: hanging out man great to great to meet
2824.60s: you and great to have you on thank you
2827.40s: Eric it's a pleasure thanks for having
2829.00s: me bye-bye
