0.56s: what up outliers quick market update
2.72s: we're going to go through the markets r
4.32s: large talk about some upcoming news I
7.60s: want to talk about my Siggy loss because
10.00s: those are always fun for everybody I
12.28s: want to talk about crowd strike the
13.72s: rally that's going on there and then I
15.48s: want to take a look at uh GameStop and
18.12s: chewy both because I had a couple
19.68s: questions on each of those not going to
21.60s: lie couple minutes late today because
23.64s: your boy was watching a rugby highlight
26.32s: reel that completely captivated me for a
29.16s: while I love rugby so it was a super
32.44s: sick video but we're we're back in the
34.28s: office now we're ready to rock and roll
35.60s: so what's going on today well a few
38.00s: things
39.60s: realistically I think when I look at the
41.76s: market today there's kind of one big
43.76s: thing that I point out which is this
45.24s: right here retail sales month over month
47.12s: came in at 1 versus 0.4 versus the prior
52.00s: being at negative 0.2 what is this all
54.12s: mean well it means that this is like the
56.00s: largest expansion in this metric for
58.60s: like the last year and a half the reason
60.80s: why this matters is because it shows
62.40s: that the economy is still relatively
65.04s: resilient we're not seeing charge offs
66.72s: going through the roof we're not seeing
68.32s: delinquencies going too crazy so all of
72.16s: that in this case leads us to just
75.40s: essentially seeing that the market is
77.48s: holding up fairly well and if we take a
81.92s: quick look at the indices now you can
84.48s: see an interesting
86.24s: realignment in terms of their price
89.16s: performance this is what we were talking
92.04s: about not too long ago whether or not
95.00s: this turns into a v-shaped recovery
97.40s: straight up to the highs and so far spy
100.52s: is running that route qes is not too far
104.12s: behind Russell's lagging like it is
107.40s: lagging bro it's not even closed this
110.16s: Gap yet from the initial drop whereas
113.36s: both q's and spy are beyond that Gap and
116.12s: they're starting to close in on previous
118.48s: highs Q's is about halfway there so I
122.32s: see a slight realignment of the indices
125.56s: but it's not robust yet and iwm is still
129.92s: kind of the the weak one of the bunch
132.08s: now if we take a look at the FED watch
135.60s: tool we can see that the probability of
138.00s: a cut is still 100% for September 18th
142.44s: but the probability of a 25 basis point
145.96s: cut is now higher why is that the case
148.76s: well because the reason we were looking
150.80s: at potentially a 5050 basis point cut
152.68s: previously is because we thought and had
155.32s: pretty good indication that the economy
157.20s: was like really starting to slow so we
159.04s: thought the FED might have to be a
160.36s: little more drastic in their plan and we
163.20s: saw this being priced in much higher if
166.12s: we go back in time here you'll see not
168.76s: all that long ago we were looking at a
172.20s: probability of a 50 basis point cut up
175.40s: at 55% a week ago and again that
177.92s: essentially corresponds with when we're
180.12s: going through this drop so now we're
182.76s: getting new information and as always in
185.80s: basian statistics new information means
188.12s: new probabilities and that's what's
189.44s: going on here so for me when I look at
192.00s: the market here it does look like it's
193.60s: starting to gain a foothold it is I
195.96s: don't think it's out of the woods I
197.32s: think it's going to continue to be
198.68s: really really predicated on new news but
201.36s: right now the news is good so it leads
203.36s: me to believe that large caps are
205.12s: probably going to continue to cruise
206.44s: along be happy move closer to these
208.24s: highs unless there's a change of pace
211.44s: for whatever reason we're also seeing
214.08s: the percentage of S&P 500 stocks
216.68s: cracking above the 50-day moving
218.16s: averages over 66% we're seeing vix
221.36s: continue to contract down before I get
223.68s: into my crappy trades that's a good
225.24s: trade still The Fading vix is again just
228.36s: such an easy trade not easy to carry
231.44s: sometimes it can be super painful but it
234.04s: generally pans out sooner or later
235.88s: depending on how patient we are now
238.20s: let's take a quick look across across
240.20s: the
241.64s: sectors and it's a little bit of a mixed
244.56s: bag so main areas of strength I'm seeing
248.88s: really come down to things like xlp XLR
252.76s: xlu XLV you can see all of these are
256.12s: positive sloping on the standard
257.64s: deviation channels so they are showing
260.20s: strength still but many of them are
262.44s: starting to Peter out just a little bit
264.96s: and again this is kind of normal
266.88s: especially if we think this broader
268.64s: Trend might start to resume it would not
271.44s: surprise me at all to see xlk Tech
274.68s: really start flying if it looks like
276.88s: it's going to be sustained if it's not I
279.16s: think these more defensive plays is just
281.32s: as far as broad sector themes probably
283.60s: hold out all right now let's take a look
287.48s: at Siggy with my world renown trade that
292.20s: just straight up straight up did nothing
296.48s: like I wanted and by sigy obviously I
299.44s: meant sigga my bad um yeah so so I
304.12s: started entering it when it broke Above
306.80s: This handle here it looked interesting
308.96s: to the upside I didn't take anything
310.92s: down yesterday cuz I I really did think
312.76s: that there was going to be a little bit
313.80s: more of a continuation and then it open
315.92s: gap
317.44s: down super sick for me now realistically
321.12s: it doesn't matter it's a super small
322.76s: trade I got in right around when it was
324.44s: like 1060 it closed today at 962 so it's
327.00s: down like a dollar but it's just super
329.32s: annoying
330.28s: that this thing that I really had pretty
333.12s: specific expectations for just at least
335.40s: as far as the continuation play just
337.36s: goes and does whatever it wants which
339.48s: again I bring these up as a reminder
341.56s: that is is cool as our ideas might be
344.12s: the market does not care bro does not
347.44s: care and this seemingly felt like it
350.84s: probably was more likely to go up than
352.36s: down and who knew it could do both at
354.72s: once because it g down but then it went
356.52s: up big it had a a pretty massive up move
359.24s: but from the close yesterday it was down
360.80s: like 19% or something so yeah still not
364.60s: a good move I ended up flattening about
366.96s: half the trade I'll leave half of it on
368.68s: cuz I don't think that the thesis is
370.32s: dead and we're just ready for more Gap
373.20s: moves hoay for me but I mean for a
376.40s: little while on the open it was ugly
377.96s: right because if I start getting in
379.00s: around 1060 and then it opens down here
381.20s: at like 7 that that's a pretty big down
383.36s: move but news-driven trades like this
385.36s: are always much smaller allocations
387.04s: because I know exactly how these things
388.56s: go it is a straight crap shoe it's again
391.00s: it's a numbers game I'm trying to play
392.84s: things that probabilistically seem to me
395.28s: more likely to do one thing than
397.00s: something else but it doesn't mean it's
398.28s: going to so this is a great example of
400.92s: something that did what I wanted but
403.32s: also not at the same time did what I
405.00s: wanted and that it had a really big day
406.76s: from open to close but didn't because I
408.48s: had a giant gap down from the day
411.48s: before sick so now let's pivot over
414.96s: really quick to
416.72s: GameStop and this is a little
420.04s: interesting because one of the the broad
422.68s: themes we've been expecting so far with
424.44s: GameStop is that some of the suppression
426.88s: that it might be experiencing is due to
428.52s: the broader small caps lagging that's
431.52s: not really so much the case now for the
433.84s: last couple days small caps have started
436.20s: gaining a little bit of a footing and
437.72s: GameStop is still trending generally
439.64s: sideways so we're seeing it now hovering
442.08s: right around the 22 handle it's
444.04s: definitely consolidating which is great
445.56s: to see moving averages are starting to
447.20s: kind of realign based on this movement
449.68s: the longer term moving averages are
450.88s: going to be grossly out of whack because
452.96s: of these kinds of recent moves so
455.92s: overall that part's generally good to
458.12s: see if we take a look at the options
461.64s: they've gotten pretty busy here so in
464.32s: here I'm seeing the call oi at 738,000
467.88s: put oi 350 so we are at the 2:1 which is
472.88s: again something I typically specifically
474.80s: look for in something like GameStop and
476.48s: we can see that we're spread across the
479.12s: VAR expiration Cycles I see density
481.56s: still in 16 Aug although some of these
485.28s: further expiration Cycles are starting
487.28s: to get built out like the 17 Jan notice
489.40s: it's here here here it's kind of
492.16s: contesting for some of the bigger spots
493.64s: so people are playing deeper options
495.28s: which this is relatively new they've
497.20s: been playing them here and there but
499.12s: this is now becoming large enough
501.48s: positions that I think it's going to
504.72s: continue um building out like a broader
507.44s: thematic position like these are
509.08s: obviously longer term plays of some sort
511.32s: there's also a reality where some of
512.84s: this can be hedging activity for
515.28s: institutions of some sort I don't know
517.16s: either way so I don't want to put a
519.04s: finger on it because I don't know but we
523.08s: are generally seeing from an options
526.08s: perspective more of a buildout in these
531.16s: specific expirations which is again
534.08s: relatively new now if I take a look at
536.48s: the volume for today 104,000 against 29
541.28s: so relatively quiet and we're seeing 16
544.36s: augs super busy so the 23s had
549.80s: 9800
551.40s: transact the 22s 7,000 transact so on
554.76s: and so forth so one of my guesses is to
557.84s: see if this is starting to establish out
560.32s: in other expiration Cycles so here you
562.44s: can see that the 28 a 25s are starting
565.96s: to move along did I say 28 aug 23 a
569.96s: sorry about that 23 a so let's see yeah
572.88s: you can see like all these greens this
574.52s: is net ads so these are people that are
576.44s: rotating somewhat from this front
578.56s: expiration so you can see like this is
580.20s: getting taken down a little bit these
581.60s: are still building up I wonder if this
583.68s: will be the case leading into tomorrow
585.68s: it looks like it will be because I see
588.16s: 3700 contracts here 5,700 traded so
591.72s: automatically essentially at least 2,000
594.04s: are going to be added which is actually
596.00s: pretty surprising to me if I'm being
597.48s: honest cu the day left but I guess it's
599.88s: super cheap and kind of standard Lotto
602.80s: plays that's what it looks like to me
604.60s: because I still am not seeing like that
608.12s: standard really bullish configuration
610.12s: that I talked about that I caught at the
612.20s: end of May or at the end of April early
614.16s: May where you can see the options chains
616.24s: getting really really heavy really
618.12s: concentrated you could see stock volume
619.88s: starting to pick up we're not really
621.48s: seeing much of that happening right now
623.60s: so from an Institutional standpoint or
625.92s: kind of a catalyst standpoint one of the
627.48s: things I look for is just larger volume
630.64s: and the cool part about keeping your eye
632.36s: out for those kinds of things is that
633.56s: they don't happen overnight they take a
635.12s: few minutes so yeah the the volume in
638.20s: here isn't anything too crazy but what I
641.56s: really want to see is where are we
644.52s: starting to build out after this week
647.04s: because after this week open interest is
649.20s: going to dump quite a bit there's
651.76s: 300,000 of this total oi in this front
654.88s: expiration that's going to go away after
656.64s: tomorrow it's got to go somewhere I'm
658.84s: very curious is where it goes because I
662.00s: don't know if people are going to start
663.20s: building out for the earnings release on
665.60s: the 4th or if they're going to start
666.84s: moving out to the next primary
668.16s: expiration again this is a really
669.96s: interesting product but what I can tell
671.44s: you is like this kind of thing is
673.08s: fascinating that the 13 stps are going
675.32s: crazy there's 113 Vol in there as
679.40s: compared to the 86 Vol I'm seeing in six
681.84s: and further in so so it's really hard to
684.92s: say but this expiration cycle looks like
687.76s: it's starting to get a little bit more
689.44s: interesting and I don't exactly know why
691.80s: so if we take out 13 step still super
694.48s: light super super light let's take a
697.12s: quick look at the v in there I'm just
699.20s: curious if we can find
700.88s: anything take a look at 13 St yeah
703.28s: that's like you see how Jagged that is
705.68s: that's just misprice not I don't want to
707.32s: call it mispricing but it's not agreed
709.56s: pricing on what the correct vs are for
712.00s: these different things so the fact that
713.20s: it's all bumpy like that is not not
715.72s: normal and you'll notice that kind of
717.56s: this is more so what in agreed
720.92s: volatility surface in this case smile
722.84s: will look like this is when there's
724.60s: discrepancies different people pricing
726.32s: things differently this can also happen
727.72s: just when there's a wide market and it's
729.56s: just showing the vs there even though
731.60s: that's not what they actually think the
732.84s: vs are that's super common too you don't
735.28s: always want to rest the order from the
737.24s: market making perspective based on the
739.24s: vs that you think it actually is you'll
740.96s: kind of rest uh dummy vs so that you're
743.72s: not showing your hands in terms of what
745.36s: you think VA actually is and then as
747.60s: somebody comes in to move the market
749.20s: market then you can adjust your quotes
752.24s: but interesting the other thing I want
754.92s: to take a look at quick is Crow strike
756.92s: then uh chewy so for crowd strike it is
760.32s: starting like a this is the exact move
762.88s: I've been talking about and the ability
764.40s: to trade this in both directions it's
766.56s: very interesting to me because had this
768.68s: big giant news- driven selloff for lots
770.80s: of different reasons for relatively
772.88s: smaller problem but pretty high severity
775.84s: and it's starting to navigate its way
777.72s: out of here so this is a rubber band
779.52s: that's been expanded pretty massively
781.28s: and now it's starting to move back into
784.28s: value so I find that really interesting
786.92s: it's literally butting up against this
788.64s: volume node that's down here and then as
791.04s: long as it continues that momentum it
792.56s: looks pretty healthy now it does have
794.12s: earnings coming up which has the ability
796.28s: to play a lot of games but in this case
798.76s: after this kind of sell-off I actually
800.76s: would imagine even if earnings Is Not
802.40s: Great it still would be a positive
804.68s: catalyst so this to me looks like a
808.68s: pretty inserted recovery play and again
811.48s: like it's just one I've been talking
812.60s: about for a while cuz it's been such a
814.08s: fascinating case study and you can see
816.28s: that I mean moving averages are catching
817.76s: up underneath it's breaking up above
819.32s: here I like it essentially as soon as it
821.28s: starts breaking Above This handle here
824.40s: and this is like the first warning shot
826.48s: that it looks like it's starting to get
827.76s: legs above like 243 if it breaks above
830.40s: this floor which it just did today above
832.36s: 255 it starts to look stronger and
834.32s: stronger that doesn't mean that it flies
835.68s: right back up but it looks like the
838.00s: downsides priced in from move that's
839.96s: generally what I see here and then
844.04s: chewy this is showing way more bullish
848.52s: drift so as I look across chewy and we
852.04s: take a look not at the implied
853.76s: volatility take a look at the options we
855.24s: can see 276,000 calls against 194 puts
858.80s: so much tighter centralization and
860.64s: you'll notice that we're all over on
862.64s: expirations we have stuff in 16 Aug we
865.28s: have stuff that's out I'm guessing this
867.04s: is 25 yep 17 Gen 25
869.76s: we have stuff that's out in 20 SE so
871.68s: it's kind of all over the place so the
873.64s: options markets in here are relatively
876.48s: conflicted but it does have earnings
878.80s: coming up and it looks like the 28th
883.52s: before the market and you can see that
886.00s: priced in beautifully here on the 30th
888.64s: expiration cycle 101% Vol so pretty busy
893.36s: for chewy and it's starting to to gain
895.32s: its footing it's above all the Mas it's
897.40s: definitely above the point of control at
898.84s: this point it didn't even base that much
901.48s: in here it looks like the next volume
902.88s: node is essentially right here which now
905.68s: would serve as support technically
907.88s: speaking so we'll have to keep an eye on
910.52s: how chewy plays out from here so bunch
913.08s: of interesting stuff going on Market's
914.56s: starting to turn over a bit in a
916.36s: positive direction so as always if
918.04s: there's anything you need let me know
919.76s: throw it in the comments below be an
920.92s: outlier I'll see you guys later
