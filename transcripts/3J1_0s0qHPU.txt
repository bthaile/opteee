0.00s: What's up you guys this one's all about GME because it's kind of quiet out there
4.94s: So should be a relatively quick video just keep in the cadence up taking a look at what's happening on a daily basis here
11.36s: So what did we see today? Well ended at 25 50
16.92s: 1.11 percent on the day and
21.12s: We are in this consolidation
24.56s: Section in here you could tell it is about
28.28s: As narrow as you can get were range bound between 25 70 and to the downside on the closes opens 24 75 so like a buck
38.60s: We are just below the point of control and
41.92s: All this means to me is that a lot of people are still willing to transact here. There's a lot of
47.20s: Both buying and selling when we look at the overall average volume though. It's pretty quiet
51.22s: It's below the one month average vault today has been the quietest. It's been
56.88s: Since it looks like looks like pre squeeze
63.28s: This might be close. What was the volume here 9.5
68.64s: To 7.7. Yeah, so this is the quietest bend essentially since we saw this
73.68s: Pop way back here and the beginning or in the middle of May I should say
79.04s: So
80.24s: Quiet day out there moving averages are all starting to look flat and
84.64s: Yeah, I mean for me the way I'm looking at it right now
87.60s: I have no options out on the position and that's just because it's not really moving a whole lot
92.64s: But I do have shares on the position. I actually just added some more shares
98.00s: The primary reason for that is just complementing a little bit of the broader portfolio and specifically with this position
105.92s: I do have some short options out against it 90 days out
110.16s: It's for a couple different reasons, but it's mostly to provide a bit of a short-term tailwind
116.16s: In case we do get a pullback
118.16s: So this is not so much is some sort of theta to K play
122.32s: It's definitely much more of a downside hedge if needed and it guarantees a decent profit with where we're at right now
132.00s: But those will be managed more likely than not on either a pullback or they'll be moved out as we get closer in time
139.44s: So typically when I'm selling options, especially like short calls against long
144.56s: Delta's whether it's long calls or long shares. I like to be a little bit closer in time
149.36s: But I'm actually planning on playing both of these expiration cycles when I start to see
154.40s: Just a little bit more movement. So that's why I'm moving these further out. It fits the broader picture
160.08s: Just a little bit better now overall volume today was very light we had 118,000 calls trade
167.36s: Looks like my strangle expired out of the money. That's great news
172.48s: And we had the put side at 26,800 so very very quiet across the board
180.88s: Now when I look at the existing open interest this is still narrower than it's been historically calls
188.16s: 691,000 against through 1804,000 puts so not a ton
193.84s: That I'm seeing there volatility is so below this is we haven't seen this front expiration below
200.96s: 104 a hot
202.64s: Minute and it's not above 100 until we get to the 16 aug expiration
206.56s: So again, I already talked about this the last couple days that it just seems like we're coming into a bit of a quiet period
213.44s: At least based on what I can see from the options markets and this continues
218.16s: To seemingly confirm that the other thing is take a look at the number of calls being sold here
223.60s: 34% of the volume today was sold calls. I was part of that
228.56s: But for people like me, we're just looking at a way to take in a little bit of premium
233.44s: The downside is it's not even really that sweet to the upside when I say that sweet in this context. It's just kind of
241.36s: A cheeky way of saying expensive call
245.04s: Options
246.48s: Like these you you guys have seen me look at these enough by now look at how crazy these are
252.88s: This front expiration is all over the map and I find that very interesting
258.56s: We haven't seen this low of a ratio of call side to put side
263.20s: In a really long time and then out here in the 16 aug you can see the 120s are really being bit up pretty heavy
272.80s: But pretty much everything from like the 95s to the one 15s. They're really really suppressed
279.44s: So another opportunity down in here
283.20s: You can
284.24s: There you go
286.72s: Just in case you wanted to see a lot of people who they get upset when they can't see the whole thing
289.92s: I'm looking at what I get so let I get my fat head out of your way
294.32s: But yeah
295.52s: The the vault curve here is interesting but
298.96s: Mostly what I'm seeing across the board in this is stuff just quieting down
304.80s: That's overall what it looks like when I take a look at trades in this case
309.20s: I'm filtering by stuff that at least has 50 contracts. I don't care if it's call or puts
315.76s: But you can see the overall sizes trading are small
320.16s: And the relative value of a lot of these is also very small right so we have 485 but these are 47 cents
326.88s: We had 372 of these 25 and a half calls that were bought but there is 61 cents
332.48s: So like these aren't a lot of like really high conviction style trades
337.20s: There's a lot of premium selling going on that I can see and then when we take a quick look here
343.04s: at
344.48s: our
345.84s: Options flow from unusual wills. Just kind of aggregates this a little more cleanly for you guys
352.24s: Looking at the call side on purchased calls everything is below
356.40s: $100,000. This is again one of the most quiet days that I've seen since
360.96s: If I look on the sales side again very very quiet
365.20s: All across the board
368.16s: Now if we add quickly the put side in
372.00s: drop these calls out
374.16s: Super quiet all below
376.32s: $100,000 and then on the purchase side also all below $100,000
380.96s: So what I'm highlighting is
383.44s: We are coming into a bit of a quiet period. It would seem
386.88s: And with something like GameStop you never know if it's actually quiet or if it's temporary quiet about to get real loud
393.28s: We do not know and I do think now's an interesting time to start looking at the positions that you have
398.64s: Make sure that you have the exposure you want because a lot of times you can see something in here
402.80s: And you're like man it looks kind of boring and sometimes that's a good time
407.04s: To reconfigure your exposure because if you start trying to get long when things are up here
412.72s: It's much more difficult and your risk is much higher whereas if you're
416.80s: Adjusting when we're down just hovering in these really consolidated levels
421.36s: It's a little bit of a different story
422.96s: I set a bunch of different stops for me to phase out of my positions
427.76s: That's essentially what all these different alerts are
430.96s: To get me out when I don't want to hold when things aren't moving my direction
436.16s: So take a look at what you got
438.16s: And as always if you have any questions or anything you want me to take a look at let me know
441.76s: I am here for it being outlier. See you guys later
