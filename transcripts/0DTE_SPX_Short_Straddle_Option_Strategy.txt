0.42s: ah the grind of trading unfortunately
2.88s: you're not going to see me on a private
4.68s: jet in this video although I do have a
6.42s: McLaren which is pretty sick
8.34s: um I'm gonna walk you through a trade
9.78s: that I made today I made 4 000 bucks in
11.76s: it and it's nothing to write home about
13.44s: but the name the game of trading is
16.26s: creating consistent profits based on an
18.60s: observable hypothesis that you can
20.58s: reliably execute over time that's really
23.22s: all there is to it it's nothing super
24.60s: sexy I don't have some sort of briefcase
26.76s: to open up and to stand in front of an
29.28s: aircraft for you guys I apologize my
31.98s: only fans is doing very poorly I can't
34.14s: imagine why and this is essentially what
36.90s: I'm relegated to do for a living so all
39.60s: that aside I do want to talk to you
41.34s: about a trade and it's a short straddle
44.58s: I think this is a really useful strategy
46.74s: that can be adapted a lot of different
48.36s: ways for different account sizes and it
51.18s: explicitly allows us to take advantage
52.74s: of some certain market conditions that
56.28s: probably belong in a lot of people's
58.14s: toolbox because when we have Catalyst
61.08s: driven events this is actually a really
63.90s: great way to capitalize on those
66.24s: instances on a large sample size so I'm
68.16s: going to walk you through the trade how
69.54s: I like to structure it how I think about
70.92s: it why I made the trade I did today and
73.38s: then at the end of the video I'm going
74.70s: to talk to you about some details
76.08s: essentially that you can use to modify
77.64s: it so that it fits into your individual
79.68s: toolkit because we all will have our own
81.72s: takes on it so what's up everybody Eric
83.76s: here welcome back to all the outliers a
85.44s: shout out to the patreon members as well
87.66s: as the YouTube members and let's talk
89.88s: about trading some straddles so this was
92.94s: in SPX and if you were in the YouTube
96.06s: live session yesterday which was 15 may
99.66s: I actually talked about this exact trade
102.00s: and I talked about why I was going to
104.10s: place this trade and this is kind of the
107.70s: full circle life cycle of what happened
109.86s: so the ticker like I said SPX is just a
112.86s: broad market index and there's a few
115.44s: reasons why I trade the SPX although if
118.08s: you have a smaller account you're not
119.22s: relegated to SPX you could always trade
121.14s: the Spy but I like SPX because it's cash
124.20s: settled this is an important note
126.36s: because as we talk about the way I like
128.94s: to manage these positions it being cash
131.64s: settled is important because I want to
133.32s: hold it into expiration why would I want
136.02s: to do that please cost friction it's
139.44s: expensive it's expensive for retail
141.78s: traders to interact with the markets and
144.12s: I remind people about that because it's
146.10s: not relegated to the commissions you pay
148.26s: it's the slippage on the back side it's
150.54s: the payment for order flow in terms of
151.98s: where your order actually gets routed
153.42s: and executed against if you look at the
155.64s: back side of trading it's very expensive
157.62s: so I think it's it's important for
159.96s: retail traders to be mindful of it I
161.94s: want to be very clear that does not mean
164.22s: that I would purposefully build entire
167.46s: strategies around decreasing my cost
170.28s: structure that I think becomes a little
172.92s: too over the top but on the flip side if
176.28s: you're completely not paying attention
177.84s: to cost structure structure strucker
180.06s: structure and you try something like
182.22s: scalping you'll realize real quick how
184.98s: expensive it is and how you're getting
186.42s: eaten alive very slowly even on a lot of
189.54s: small trades so this trade is really
193.80s: pretty simple this is the trade that
195.90s: went on and I'm going to talk to you
197.34s: about the details as to why I selected
199.68s: this this was shortly after the open it
202.68s: was around 7 30 a.m Pacific time is like
205.20s: 7 31 732 something like that and the SPX
209.16s: was trading around 41.25 so let's take a
211.14s: look at SPX quick
213.42s: so this is a one day one minute chart so
217.08s: that's why it kind of looks so crazy and
219.60s: I'm actually going to zoom this out just
221.22s: a bit here maybe to like a six month
222.66s: daily and we've been trending sideways
225.60s: for a little bit here so this is part of
227.34s: my overall hypothesis but there's a
229.86s: couple other things that really go into
231.60s: why I structured the trade the way I did
233.88s: and I'll show you some of them right
235.44s: here the very first thing is today was a
238.02s: busy day we had retail sales industrial
240.24s: production capacity utilization business
242.22s: inventories the housing index and six
244.74s: fed speakers this just in general tells
247.86s: me volatility and it's not that any one
250.02s: of these events were super massive
251.46s: although retail sales definitely was
253.32s: impactful
254.70s: when I see busy days like this I start
257.64s: thinking Hmm how can I take advantage of
259.74s: volatility because volatility around
261.78s: days like this tends to be busy it's not
263.94s: quite to the same degree of what you
265.68s: would see for like an earnings release
267.06s: but it's still noteworthy enough that
269.22s: I'm going to take a look at it so going
271.50s: back over to think or Swim if we take a
274.92s: look at volatility I'm going to pull
277.32s: this up and I'm going to move my stupid
279.00s: face up out your way and if we look down
281.28s: here uh yesterday was the 15th implied
283.98s: volatility again is the yellow
286.32s: and then the white lines gray lines was
288.84s: realized and notice how it was trending
291.24s: implied was pretty elevated especially
294.00s: compared to less fry last Friday over
296.16s: the weekend we saw a spike up on Monday
298.58s: and a lot of this in my opinion is due
301.80s: to anticipation of today's numbers but
304.50s: there's a lot of other stuff
306.12s: on right now and I'm not going to try to
307.74s: you know add a discrete explanation for
310.56s: very complex systems really what matters
312.90s: here is implied volatility looked
314.46s: overstated compared to realize
315.78s: volatility now one quick note is I did
318.72s: actually run this through a my implied
322.08s: volatility surface model to come up with
324.06s: my own volatility calculation and it
326.94s: doesn't really matter that much because
328.26s: my calculation is not going to be
330.30s: something that's super sophisticated
331.74s: able to even counter play with the
334.20s: larger entities out there so that's why
336.42s: in a lot of instances literally just
338.40s: using this simple IV HP HP plot is
341.70s: useful
342.66s: this is not the end-all be-all though
345.30s: because unless you have ways to
347.40s: calculate the intraday volatility which
349.26s: I also do that but for most people this
352.08s: will get you pretty damn close and
353.76s: that's really what I what I want to hone
355.50s: in on here because if we take a look at
357.36s: implied volatility for the 30 day it was
359.52s: 1761 for seven days it was 1801 and then
363.42s: historic volatility for that same
364.92s: trading week five days was
369.68s: 0.06 percent and for the same month was
374.22s: 13 so the point being is IV was
376.86s: overstated relative to HP that's it
378.66s: that's really the the main thing I'm
380.70s: looking at here so I saw a catalyst I
384.06s: observed IV to HB and then I wanted to
386.94s: understand if there's anything else
388.38s: going on in the markets that should that
389.94s: I should be aware of that I'm not paying
391.74s: attention to the trade and that wasn't
393.24s: the case so this trade went on so I sold
396.00s: the 16 May 4125 calls and puts so it was
399.72s: a straddle at 1808. now the Deltas
402.48s: weren't perfect 50 50 when I put it on I
404.46s: think it was like 48 or 49.
407.10s: um but nonetheless it's I picked the
409.92s: same strike because it was close enough
411.90s: and let's talk about kind of the the
414.30s: math behind the trade and then the way I
415.92s: managed it the math behind this trade is
418.08s: simple I had a 10 lot so on a 10 lot I
420.78s: collected eighteen thousand and eighty
422.76s: dollars and you say oh wow that's a lot
424.26s: of money it's really not and it took a
426.60s: lot of money to do that so it took 594
429.42s: 000 to put on this trade so
432.06s: this is on portfolio margin so if you
434.46s: don't have a portfolio margin account
435.90s: you might say oh I can't do that why
438.18s: would I even bother watching this video
439.50s: and I encourage you to continue watching
441.72s: because there's a bunch of stuff you
443.04s: could do you could scale this down you
444.54s: don't have to do a ton lot you could do
445.62s: a one lot I actually think trading these
448.02s: kinds of strategies in smaller sizes and
450.72s: products is really pertinent so in this
453.60s: case yeah just scale this down to
455.52s: whatever makes sense for you or change
457.62s: products because if you go from SPX to
460.26s: spy you're already going down to a tenth
462.48s: the size and then you could close down
464.22s: the lot the whole point is talking to
466.02s: you about the hypothesis just happens to
468.06s: be the trade that I had on so this
469.74s: represents a three percent return on
471.60s: invested capital in a day that's
473.46s: actually really good so I wouldn't let
476.10s: this significant margin number confuse
479.10s: you into thinking wow you put up a ton
481.44s: of money to only potentially make 18 a
485.22s: three percent return on invested capital
486.72s: in a single day is massive if you
488.94s: annualize that
491.40s: it's like a several million compounded
494.40s: percent return literally I think it's
495.72s: like four point something million
497.10s: percent return if you analyze that so
502.26s: so now what happened in the trade well I
505.02s: just took it into expiration it expired
506.76s: around 14.50 and this is exactly why I
510.90s: chose SPX one because of the size it
513.54s: makes sense for me but then two most
515.58s: importantly it's cash settled so I don't
517.92s: have to worry about a round trip on the
520.02s: back end and this is an important note
521.76s: because when you're trading strategies
523.50s: like this volatility specifically Focus
526.32s: strategies you have to be prepared to
528.96s: hold the trade because if you try to
531.18s: Institute all of these various kinds of
533.34s: stops
534.72s: it's really difficult to actually make
538.02s: these make work
539.58s: make these make work
541.44s: I don't know really what that means but
543.12s: I think what I was going for is to make
545.22s: these work and what I'm specifically
548.28s: driving at here is when we're trading a
551.22s: high implied volatility to realize
552.90s: volatility overstatement hypothesis or
555.00s: just that IV is expensive something like
557.10s: that
557.88s: if that's your hypothesis we still need
560.94s: to expect something to move it's going
563.28s: to move within that range really all I
566.58s: needed it to do was not move 18 in One
570.84s: Direction and then I was going to be
572.46s: okay off of the 41.25 that's essentially
575.52s: what this trade boils down to I just
577.26s: needed it to stay within 18 I'm going to
579.72s: walk out with a profit so letting this
582.00s: go into expiration it benefits the
584.46s: strategy in multiple ways that's not to
586.68s: say do not have risk management in mind
589.26s: you have to have risk management in mind
591.12s: in this case the plan was if it started
595.32s: to break out in one direction or another
597.96s: I was going to make a decision so what I
600.60s: mean by that is if I pull this back down
602.82s: and I take a look at what the percent
605.58s: move was today compared to the five day
608.22s: average daily range or the average true
609.96s: range it's about a percent so if we
612.48s: started ending a
614.58s: a five-day ADR or if we started getting
617.52s: close to the ATR that tells me that
621.24s: we're trending we're trending in a
622.80s: pretty big way and it probably makes
624.18s: sense for me to get out I want to avoid
626.88s: doing that I want to give the trade as
628.44s: much room as possible and if I have to
630.30s: take it into expiration at a loss that's
632.28s: okay but as long as it's within a
634.74s: reasonable bounce so that I'm not
635.94s: holding on to something that's running
637.14s: away so in this specific instance I
639.60s: didn't use a percent credit received
641.82s: like a lot of people like to do I simply
643.98s: use the data on recent movements to
647.04s: create thresholds for me to observe and
649.50s: then essentially to exit the trade if
651.84s: these ever get to essentially like a
653.94s: five times loss I'm getting out that's
657.02s: absolute worst case scenario just to
660.42s: create some sort of significant
662.04s: threshold I pretty much never hold to
664.56s: that point because I know I'm wrong
666.36s: before then if I see this start trending
669.12s: in one way or another I very frequently
671.28s: will exit but the problem is the markets
674.40s: the the way they've been trading and
675.78s: this way the context is so important
677.82s: because if you look at the way that the
679.56s: markets literally have been trading
680.88s: essentially since February it's these
683.46s: intraday trending movements notice how
685.50s: big these candles are so all of that is
688.50s: baked into the specific profit and loss
691.44s: management approach that I take here and
693.48s: this is why I needed to give it room to
695.28s: move and it's exactly why I simply was
697.74s: going to use the ADR ATR if it started
700.26s: to exceed ATR it's probably time to get
702.24s: out might give it a little bit more room
704.16s: to move but I've traded these enough
706.08s: that I trust myself to execute
708.42s: accurately if you're a new Trader that
710.58s: can be really dangerous because we get
712.50s: super emotional and we start to make
714.06s: mistakes I am not exactly in that bucket
717.12s: because I've been doing this for a
718.44s: minute but that's exactly how I went
720.18s: about
721.08s: planning the Lost side of the trade so
723.36s: what does this come out to about a three
725.82s: thousand one hundred thirty dollar
726.96s: return which is a 0.53 return on
730.80s: invested capital
732.00s: I think I might have told you guys I
733.32s: made four grand so sorry I lied to you
735.72s: um it's 31 30. and somebody might be
738.48s: saying oh wow that kind of sucks only
740.28s: 0.53 return on invested Capital first of
743.10s: all this was in a single day so again if
746.16s: you annualize that return it's 589 let's
749.70s: not say I'm going to do this every
750.90s: single day but people have this awful
753.42s: habit of not understanding the context
757.08s: of percentages and raw numbers and it
760.02s: leads to these really skewed insane
762.12s: expectations because most of you guys
763.98s: are too busy seeing people on Twitter
766.08s: and on YouTube talking about 50x in your
769.02s: money in two days and now you're
771.24s: mentally because those are now your
773.04s: expectations
774.18s: this is what's worked for me like I said
776.28s: it's nothing super sexy but that's a few
778.74s: dollars for me to go buy another drone
780.42s: or some and hopefully not crash
782.94s: that one into the ocean I'm just kidding
784.14s: I didn't crash my drone but I am
785.34s: prepared to do that because I get real
787.56s: close to the water but the point being
789.54s: is this is kind of the name of the game
790.98s: it's just a matter of looking for a
794.58s: series of observable events and creating
797.04s: trades around it in this case I'm using
799.26s: volatility in catalysts to develop the
801.66s: trade structure to take advantage of
803.04s: implied volatility being overstated now
805.14s: the last thing I will know is it's
807.12s: really important to run these kinds of
808.50s: trades in aggregate just as this one
810.54s: went right I was posting about this in
812.88s: the Discord a few days ago on several
814.44s: that went wrong it's important to
816.66s: realize that you do need a decent sample
819.60s: size for this to actually materialize
821.94s: because if we have Smart implied
824.16s: volatility calculations and the market
826.92s: essentially meets that expectation the
830.34s: trade's not going to make much if any
832.02s: money probably be a small loss so those
835.20s: instances happen pretty regularly but
837.06s: the cool part is even though people get
839.58s: really scared about things like short
841.14s: straddles because it's unrealized loss
843.96s: potential or an undefined loss potential
846.50s: it still tends to be okay and it's
850.20s: because of the same exact function that
851.82s: implied volatility pricing tends to be
853.44s: pretty good and if it's off it's not
855.78s: typically off by a hundred percent which
858.18s: is the kinds of moves you would need to
860.10s: have like just absolutely catastrophic
862.62s: losses on these especially if you're
864.30s: asleep at the wheel and the last thing I
866.46s: will say is that if you choose to put on
867.90s: these kinds of strategies you got to be
869.64s: around you got to watch it this is not
871.62s: my typical set and forget let me come
873.66s: back at the end of the day and see what
874.80s: it did because I don't have hard manual
876.90s: stops placed at a given point in time I
879.54s: need to pay attention because if I do
881.64s: not pay attention and that starts to
883.68s: Trend or we start to get a big move I
886.08s: expose myself to massive asymmetric
888.60s: downside risk which I cannot accept I
891.48s: want these to typically work within a
893.64s: specific range as I defined using the
895.44s: ADR ATR in this instance sometimes that
898.56s: will vary to actual individual support
900.54s: and resistance levels but more often
902.82s: than not I want to give the trim the
904.56s: trade room to move but not allow it room
908.22s: to run into the wrong direction without
910.44s: being touched that's why I have to
912.54s: monitor these traits so hope you enjoyed
914.88s: like subscribe be an outlier see you
916.62s: guys later
