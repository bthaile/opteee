2.16s: hey everybody so we got eric here as
4.48s: always we got a super awesome money
7.20s: talks set up for today so
9.68s: i have uh david here he's been um
13.68s: in the markets for a hot minute at this
15.92s: point what is it over 40 years now
18.40s: yeah it's 48 years
20.16s: so coming up on 50. that's a that's a
21.92s: big
22.88s: amount of the old geezers out there
25.84s: that's a that's a big milestone but
28.88s: um so we were just talking a little bit
30.56s: about your background and whatnot but
32.24s: first you know i'd love to just welcome
33.92s: you to the channel thank you so much for
35.52s: taking some time to chat with me and in
38.00s: the audience we
39.68s: really relish specifically these kind of
42.16s: opportunities because folks like you
43.84s: with your kind of experience like i was
45.36s: saying i think it's just it's monumental
48.24s: for other people to try to pull as much
50.32s: of that as we can because you know like
52.64s: i said i started trading in 2007 and i
55.52s: know what i know which is a snapshot
57.76s: really it's a
59.52s: fraction of what you've seen so i'm
62.16s: really looking forward to just
64.08s: discussing a little bit about you know
65.76s: what you've seen over your your years
68.00s: and um get some ideas on what you're
70.40s: thinking looking forward so first like i
72.56s: said welcome to the channel and i would
74.72s: love to just start with a little bit
76.80s: about your background you know where you
79.04s: started in just your your macro level
82.16s: view of things and you know your
83.92s: relationship with the markets sure
86.32s: thanks eric thanks for having me on um
89.36s: yeah i i uh not not to get too caught up
92.24s: in the
93.12s: the you know the beginnings of this but
95.68s: i i did start as a finance major
98.56s: in college back in
100.48s: you know i entered college in 69 so
103.84s: that was vietnam years and as i joke you
106.96s: know hardly anybody was a business major
108.88s: back then people were trying to avoid
110.88s: the draft and most of them were what we
113.52s: called hearts and flowers back then but
115.20s: liberal arts and things just
117.44s: just taken something to stay in college
119.68s: um but i i knew for whatever reason i
122.00s: knew from early on that i was interested
124.40s: in finance and
126.48s: did undergrad finance an mba with a
128.72s: finance um
130.64s: background
131.84s: um
132.96s: while i was working in a bank
135.04s: i started right out of college in a
137.44s: small bank investment department
140.24s: so i had i really attribute a lot of my
143.28s: success to that really because i
146.00s: was part of a basically a two-man
148.96s: uh investment bank an investment
150.88s: operation where
152.48s: i got to manage bank portfolio as well
155.36s: as trust portfolio sentiment i got
157.44s: exposure bonds and stocks
159.60s: uh you know if you go to a bigger place
161.28s: you usually have to specialize in one or
163.20s: the other so
164.48s: there was a lot there that gave me kind
166.16s: of access to macro
168.40s: and then i went to another bank uh
170.56s: bigger bank where i had to choose and i
172.56s: went to the trust department because i
173.76s: wanted to do stocks
175.60s: um and in about four years got recruited
178.24s: away or
179.36s: applied for a job as a
181.52s: equity pension manager for a fortune 100
183.84s: company
184.96s: and that kind of really jump started the
187.04s: career where
188.48s: um i was a sole equity manager within a
191.92s: an in-house you know within the
193.76s: corporation
195.12s: they managed their pension assets
196.84s: in-house so they had somebody there two
199.68s: people
200.64s: doing um private placement they had
203.84s: a couple people doing bonds and they had
206.64s: um me doing equities
209.20s: and it really gave me again the ability
212.64s: to kind of
213.84s: be on my own not be part of a big team
216.16s: or anything
217.68s: so as i said i was chief cook and bottle
219.84s: washer where i had to you know trade i
222.32s: had to
223.52s: manage portfolio i got to do the
226.08s: strategy
227.36s: and all that and i was
229.20s: i think i was 30 years old when i went
231.20s: in there
232.24s: and it was it was actually it was
234.32s: textron their former
236.64s: ceo had been g william miller who went
239.20s: on to be carter's fed
241.76s: um chairman
243.12s: so he was he was chairman during the
244.88s: late 70s when inflation took off he had
247.84s: left by the time i got there
249.76s: um and was you know fed chairman but
252.80s: his legend he was a very
254.80s: uh well-thought of ceo and really was
258.48s: texaram being conglomerate they were
260.64s: kind of uh
262.16s: um
263.28s: you know
264.64s: their in-house stuff was very much
266.16s: private place in oregon because that's
267.44s: what a conglomerate doesn't buy you know
270.16s: assets so
271.52s: um i heard all through when i was
273.60s: recruited they had very little equity
275.92s: and then they missed the 1980 oil market
278.24s: so they dropped from the top quartile
280.64s: investor down to
282.48s: you know mid quartile
284.72s: and so they brought me in
286.40s: i was counseled by all kinds of people
288.80s: on the street saying it's a dead end
290.40s: they don't like equities don't go in
292.16s: there but i saw his chance to kind of
294.24s: show what i could do and
297.36s: um they
298.88s: i i was you know i had to report to an
300.64s: investment committee which was
302.64s: the chairman president and a bunch of
304.40s: their group officers who ran the
306.56s: conglomerate you know the divisions
309.36s: they were all in their late 50s early
311.28s: 60s and here's this 30 year old kid
313.28s: saying
314.48s: yeah i know what g william miller said
316.08s: about the risks but i can show you how
317.92s: to do this conservatively and and you
320.40s: know perform
322.24s: i look back now um and wonder how they
325.12s: ever believed that but
326.80s: i i'd have to go to meetings and
329.28s: um
330.72s: you know kind of
332.48s: piece by piece sell them because they
334.08s: had 10 of their assets in equities and
336.08s: most of those equities when i came in
337.68s: were almost private placement you know
339.76s: small
340.72s: um you know not heavily traded stocks
344.40s: and in the five years i was there i had
346.24s: top percentile performance the whole
348.08s: five years
349.36s: i took them from 10 percent of their
351.76s: assets equities to fifty percent
354.48s: because of the performance
356.56s: and it just you know from there i went
358.08s: to fidelity and then went um
360.72s: to
361.44s: uh itt hartford and ran their active
363.60s: equity effort
365.12s: was the cio of a billion dollar firm in
367.52s: new york and and then the second half of
369.76s: my career was as a macro strategist
371.68s: which i still do today so
373.92s: that's kind of a a thumbnail sketch of
376.64s: of my background anyway
379.04s: which as a thumbnail it's still
381.84s: far more any far more than any
383.84s: experience i can drum up so i
386.08s: i actually wrote a bunch of questions
387.84s: down just from that that i'd love to
389.60s: just tie into a couple of them um
392.56s: so the first one of the first things you
394.48s: mentioned was you know like your post
396.64s: college small bank experience
399.52s: um and to me it seems like there's a lot
403.20s: of value it almost seems like a startup
404.96s: experience where you know you're you're
406.80s: brought in and you end up doing a lot of
408.56s: things at once
410.08s: um
410.96s: while you were doing different things
412.64s: that you know like you said you were
413.92s: you're trading looking over you know
415.68s: some of the different allocations things
417.20s: like that um
419.44s: what
420.64s: was your interest at that point when you
423.20s: were at the small bank and why like what
425.84s: did you like working on the most
427.84s: yeah well it was all investment it was
429.76s: the um
431.44s: this was in indiana and indiana at the
433.44s: time had
434.88s: um branching couldn't go beyond county
437.68s: so this was before
439.52s: before your time you know we never had
441.44s: nationwide banks we had statewide banks
444.08s: and in some states like indiana it was
446.56s: county-wide and you couldn't you
448.08s: couldn't go outside your county um so we
451.36s: had several branches in the county we
453.52s: were the largest bank in the county so
455.68s: in a lot of ways you accumulated
458.16s: talent in these small banks that you
459.68s: wouldn't today you know today's
462.08s: today's
463.28s: branches of the big banks you basically
465.92s: have you know people that are
468.24s: following formulas you know if you're
469.76s: going to make a loan you're going to
470.64s: follow formulas whatever so i felt very
472.72s: fortunate this was a
474.24s: a fairly progressive bank that had some
476.40s: pretty good talent that came out of
478.56s: bigger city banks uh to you know go out
481.60s: away from the cities and run run
483.28s: something themselves
484.80s: my boss was
486.32s: i think 30 at the time so he was
488.64s: relatively young but he'd come out of an
490.24s: indianapolis bank and he was pretty
491.68s: progressive in fact he
493.44s: helped write some law in in indiana
496.64s: uh where state trade where county
498.40s: treasurers and and town treasurers
500.96s: could do repos
502.64s: repurchase agreements with the bank and
504.48s: earn higher returns and they could get
506.88s: through normal investments in
509.28s: bonds or whatever
510.72s: and so he he kind of
512.88s: created that and for the state
515.76s: and you know so i was learning that his
518.24s: kind of his side um
521.20s: and then you know he'd have me work on
522.80s: portfolios etc um the other thing i got
526.16s: as i said i was doing trust which is you
529.20s: know customer portfolios but also bank
531.52s: portfolio which is mostly bonds
534.40s: mostly government bonds
536.08s: and i was also sitting on an asset
538.32s: liability committee
540.24s: um which
541.76s: was made up of my boss
543.84s: the you know the head of the bank
546.24s: the comptroller the bank and
548.56s: maybe one other person but so i i was
551.20s: able to kind of understand
553.60s: things that
554.88s: people in bigger banks would never see
556.80s: until they were 10 or 15 years into the
559.20s: business right
561.04s: and so when i went to a large bank it
563.68s: was pretty interesting because i i chose
565.84s: to go the trust side but i'd still talk
569.20s: to the bank people and they were
571.04s: surprised at you know the knowledge i
573.44s: had
574.40s: you know five years into the business
576.24s: and
576.96s: it would it just i think sometimes
579.92s: being a generalist early on can be
582.88s: really really educational um
585.52s: that makes a lot of sense to be honest
587.20s: actually reminds me when i went on
590.32s: active duty in the marine corps they do
591.60s: a very similar thing where a lot of jobs
594.56s: a lot of your initial jobs they can
595.92s: rotate you all different kinds of places
597.68s: and it's for a very similar reason
599.28s: because you get to learn how the
601.12s: organization works as a whole you get
603.04s: some you know specific experience with
604.80s: where you are and then as you rotate out
606.32s: so that yeah when you were mentioning
608.08s: that small bank experience early on i
610.00s: like it's just funny to me because that
611.60s: to it seems like that sends you on a
613.60s: very different trajectory than if you
615.68s: went to a big bank you got really good
617.28s: at one specific thing
619.20s: um
620.08s: so then you talked about going to kind
622.40s: of
623.52s: getting into like pension management um
627.04s: i'm just curious what drew you in that
630.24s: direction as compared to you know
632.40s: whatever other moves were available i
634.16s: assume they were numerous in nature what
635.84s: what sent you that way
637.92s: well it gave me the opportunity being in
640.16s: a bank
641.28s: you're part of a team you know there
642.80s: were probably 10 portfolio managers
644.88s: within the bank that i was working at
646.48s: the time
647.92s: and
649.04s: this gave me the opportunity to kind of
650.56s: be my own
652.00s: um
652.96s: little
653.92s: fiefdom my own little show
656.32s: and most importantly
658.32s: um gave me the ability to
660.80s: develop a track record
662.64s: um because you're you know pension funds
665.36s: you're tracked uh performance wise and i
668.64s: had enough confidence in myself that by
670.88s: that but in the business even though i
672.24s: was only 29 years old i've been in the
674.88s: business eight years and
677.04s: i was pretty comfortable as a value
678.88s: manager that's kind of how i
681.36s: gravitated that i could manage money
684.00s: conservatively
685.60s: and perform well and it was a pretty
688.24s: good stock picker etcetera so it it was
690.80s: that that and you know i was still in a
693.36s: bank that wasn't necessarily
695.84s: giving me a fast track so it gave me the
698.72s: opportunity to get to somewhere where i
700.56s: felt i could you know fast-track more
703.36s: um and
705.60s: it really worked out in spades just
707.60s: because
708.88s: um i hit the ground running it was
711.84s: i think i went late 81 um and i told him
716.96s: to keep their powder dry we were in the
718.48s: midst of a bear market
720.16s: right um
721.36s: and and then in august of 82 which in
724.56s: hindsight was the absolute bottom of the
727.60s: the market
729.04s: i said it's time
730.48s: we had built i had built up a
733.20s: list of stocks that i felt would be
735.60s: um you know buy candidates one we were
737.76s: ready to buy so in august i went to a
740.32s: committee
741.44s: the investment committee with my
743.68s: with the other investment people
745.76s: and i asked for
747.68s: i don't remember how much money but
749.60s: again the
750.96s: the portfolio was 50 million
753.36s: at the time
755.04s: and i may have asked for another 50 and
756.80s: they gave me 25 or we may have asked for
759.04s: more and they gave me half of that but
761.84s: i came out of that meeting
763.60s: again i was 30 years old and you know
767.04s: hot to trout and it was
770.40s: i came out i can remember being upset
772.32s: that they cut it in half and i said the
774.88s: market's getting ready to go here we've
776.24s: got to get my boss going you don't know
778.96s: how successful that was he goes
781.76s: you know you're talking to a
783.60s: a group of
784.88s: guys that have been taught through the
787.36s: former chairman
789.36s: never
790.32s: to go this direction and you talked him
792.48s: into it so he said you know we really
795.04s: made a major step today so it was that
797.52s: kind of thing for the next several years
799.92s: where
800.72s: i'd ask for something they'd cut it in
802.24s: half but my boss would keep saying we're
804.40s: moving in the right direction we're
805.92s: really and like i said in five years we
808.24s: went from 10 of assets being equities
811.36s: to half of the portfolio being equities
814.16s: and we went from a 500 million dollar
816.88s: pension fund
818.24s: to a billion dollar pension so i i ended
821.20s: up going from 50 to 500 million in
823.36s: equities
824.40s: and and i was it i mean i had i shared a
828.48s: secretary with the other asset with a
830.40s: couple of the other asset guys doing you
832.80s: know real estate
834.16s: and bonds
835.68s: and other than that it was me you know
837.60s: it was and so it was fun you know you
839.20s: got to
840.16s: you got to really do the whole shebang
842.80s: that's pretty awesome so yeah one of the
844.96s: things you mentioned i was curious about
846.48s: was like when when you landed there you
848.80s: kind of were focused on equities what
850.96s: sent you that direction as compared to
852.72s: something like bonds or real estate
855.52s: uh just was interesting you know i don't
858.24s: know um just kind of
860.64s: i think a lot of people see
862.56s: equities a little more fun
864.88s: yeah yeah it's one of the reasons why i
866.72s: asked that question is because i think
868.80s: um there's a like quite a few bankers
871.52s: that that follow my channel a little bit
873.28s: now and um i know a lot of them have a
876.80s: very mixed relationship when they have
879.76s: any sort of interaction with bonds
881.60s: especially today
882.96s: you know it's a very very different
884.88s: world i think um you know compared to
887.60s: what bonds were doing you know 70s and
889.84s: 80s so i it seemed like
892.96s: equities was
894.56s: a lot riskier for you
896.48s: but that seemed to drive you a little
898.32s: bit is that is that probably fair
901.04s: equities in general tend to have higher
903.84s: risk attached to them
905.52s: i don't know that i gave it that much
907.28s: thought it was really just you know i
909.76s: had learned both bonsai and equity side
912.56s: and
913.44s: kind of said this is the site i like
915.36s: better so
916.72s: um you know there's
918.72s: there's probably more variety of what
920.72s: you have to do within that i mean
923.28s: bond
924.24s: bond guys have a lot on their plate too
926.88s: so um you know
928.88s: i'm certainly very happy i went the
930.72s: direction i did
932.32s: right um and then just another this
934.96s: one's kind of a personal question for me
937.20s: because it's something i probably will
938.40s: never experience though
940.56s: what was your
943.12s: relationship and what were the
944.88s: interactions with the investment
946.32s: committee like so you gave a little
948.72s: overview of just a little bit of you
950.96s: know how they're kind of used and used
953.12s: to and set in their ways in terms of how
954.72s: they normally conduct business you are
956.24s: able to persuade them a little bit to
958.00s: take a little um you know different
960.24s: direction i'm just curious in general
962.08s: what were those interactions like with
963.68s: the committee were they agreeable while
966.08s: you were discussing with them are they
967.36s: eager were they kind of shut off but
969.12s: then agreed
970.64s: it just seems like a very interesting
972.08s: dialogue to have with somebody you know
973.76s: when you're coming with a pretty big ask
975.44s: that is counter to their you know
977.52s: typical way of doing business
979.52s: yeah i should preface that by saying
981.36s: that the the money was pulled in house
984.08s: back in the mid 70s
986.24s: after the 74
987.92s: bear market which was the worst bear
989.36s: market we had had since the you know the
992.16s: 29 crash
993.60s: so so you know 74 into 75 was
998.48s: pretty awful and
1000.00s: g william miller was chairman at the
1001.60s: time and he he pulled all the money at
1003.60s: that time
1004.96s: most pension money was managed by the
1006.96s: big new york banks you know chase
1008.72s: manhattan and jp morgan and city city
1012.48s: corp etc
1014.00s: um
1014.88s: and it was all concentrated in new york
1017.68s: and and it got into the 50-50 you know
1020.40s: the the market in the peak in 73
1025.52s: was known as nifty 50 because it was 50
1027.92s: pretty much 50
1030.32s: big stocks ibm general motors etc at the
1033.52s: time
1034.64s: and they became known as one decision
1036.84s: stocks um which um
1039.60s: you know
1040.56s: all the portfolio managers in new york
1042.24s: that worked for these banks would all go
1044.40s: to the same luncheons and buy the same
1046.16s: stocks and so it became a very narrowly
1048.96s: focused market of 50 stocks
1051.44s: and then when the when the recession
1053.20s: came when the bear market came
1055.84s: they crashed i mean they went downstream
1058.40s: big
1059.28s: and so pension funds really lost a lot
1061.92s: of their value
1063.36s: charlie
1064.72s: g william miller
1066.48s: pulled his money and textron's money out
1069.36s: of the banks
1070.96s: brought it in house and said we're not
1072.32s: doing that again you know that's why
1073.84s: that's why they were taught you know
1075.52s: equities are a bad thing right and
1078.48s: he said never again do i want to
1080.64s: approach
1081.76s: some of my executives
1084.48s: that are very close to retirement
1086.80s: and tell them that they lost half their
1088.24s: pension assets you know at retirement
1090.64s: time so so that's why they and from that
1093.68s: point forward from the mid 70s till i
1095.92s: came in
1097.04s: the idea was we'll we'll get returns
1100.00s: through private placements and through
1101.84s: bonds and things that are more stable
1104.40s: and they did very well they were top
1106.08s: quartile doing that because you know
1108.96s: textron was kind of that way with their
1111.28s: private you know their company purchases
1113.12s: and things so they were just kind of
1114.72s: following the culture that they were
1116.08s: used to
1117.04s: so i was a step out of that you know i
1119.20s: was coming in and being very
1121.20s: opposite to that culture
1123.44s: um and so
1125.76s: i can remember and again you know you
1127.84s: think you're you know you think you're
1129.52s: eight years in that you got all the
1131.12s: knowledge you know and i look back and
1132.80s: go
1133.60s: holy cow um yeah i didn't know diddley
1136.80s: squad at that time right you know i had
1138.80s: a pretty good idea of how to make money
1140.88s: but
1141.60s: um
1142.72s: but
1143.52s: i can remember one
1145.60s: one of the group vice presidents in
1147.84s: particular
1149.12s: was kind of an old cottager he was
1150.96s: pretty you know he was he was very
1152.88s: skeptical let's put it that way
1154.88s: and i think for the whole five years i
1156.88s: was there
1158.00s: i knew at every meeting that when i
1160.48s: presented
1161.60s: i was get i was gonna get from him
1164.56s: a lot of skepticism about what i was
1166.64s: proposing so you know it helped me
1168.80s: because i knew i had to kind of um be
1171.04s: sharp with my answers no no my stuff
1173.68s: when i went in right and i i really
1176.16s: credit my boss was um
1179.12s: well respected and and he made sure we
1183.12s: knew what we were doing when we went in
1184.80s: we didn't go in unprepared so
1187.52s: um but it was you know again it was a
1190.24s: fun experience but it was also i
1192.56s: um
1193.60s: i knew that you know i was kind of
1195.92s: pulling them kicking and screaming to
1197.76s: where we were going
1200.48s: that makes a lot of sense i actually
1201.76s: think it's also really cool though that
1203.36s: you mentioned your boss and how he was
1205.12s: supportive of you because i feel like
1207.04s: you know that's just a really important
1208.64s: part of being able to sway old
1210.80s: institutions like that the reason why
1212.32s: i'm really curious about the
1213.84s: conversation obviously is just that
1216.32s: event in and of itself is interesting to
1218.16s: me but i do feel like there are some
1220.48s: tenets of that that we see now when
1222.56s: we're talking about cryptocurrencies
1224.16s: coming online and a lot of you know
1226.32s: places are super resistant you know to
1228.80s: the idea of that kind of you know
1231.20s: technology and whatnot
1232.84s: um and it's just fascinating to me how
1236.00s: like some of those kind of tendencies
1237.92s: can just repeat over time
1239.92s: um obviously different different overall
1242.64s: scenarios but nonetheless i i just draw
1245.12s: a parallel between those two when i
1246.48s: think about them um
1248.96s: the other question i had just on your
1250.96s: experience
1252.08s: while you were still there was
1254.16s: you said that you took them to about 50
1256.80s: in equities do you know out of curiosity
1259.68s: like when you left to your next gig did
1262.48s: they maintain that kind of allocation
1264.64s: did they you know as an institution
1266.56s: change their approach or do did they go
1268.40s: back to being a little more conservative
1271.36s: yeah i wouldn't talk out of school
1273.04s: except it was so long ago so i think i
1275.04s: can um
1276.64s: interestingly
1278.16s: um
1279.12s: part part of my success there like i
1281.28s: said i had
1282.80s: if you looked at the style boxes or you
1284.56s: looked at the performance boxes you know
1286.80s: you have the four quartiles and it was
1288.80s: the sei uh pension fund equity pension
1292.40s: fund universe so
1294.00s: um i was compared against pretty much
1295.92s: the pension fund universe in the country
1298.48s: and if you look at the boxes
1300.88s: i was outside the top
1303.20s: was outside the top percentile i was you
1305.20s: know
1306.08s: whip here and
1307.44s: and so
1308.80s: um part of the way i did that and i
1311.44s: wasn't
1312.56s: necessarily
1313.76s: the strategy was deliberate but i wasn't
1315.68s: doing it for performance reasons other
1317.36s: than that was what i thought we should
1318.72s: do
1319.52s: um
1320.96s: the
1321.92s: in the early 80s inflation peaked oil
1324.96s: peaked
1326.16s: and
1327.12s: i
1328.16s: and i
1329.28s: think this is where someone you know all
1332.08s: the way out to now 48 years later later
1334.56s: i see the same mistakes being made by
1337.36s: money managers
1338.72s: is
1339.52s: they tend to manage looking backwards
1342.80s: so they're extrapolating what's going on
1345.92s: and what i said was
1348.48s: this was 1982
1350.88s: so we were we were in the midst of a
1352.80s: recession
1354.24s: but we had just come through oil going
1356.32s: from
1358.00s: um
1358.96s: you know wherever it came from to 100
1362.56s: plus dollars
1364.08s: and we you know oil was the darling on
1367.52s: the street so all the portfolios
1370.08s: across wall street were loaded with oil
1372.16s: 30 30 35 percent the s p was energy
1376.08s: and particularly oil
1378.00s: and i had zero waiting in oil i
1380.00s: basically said
1381.92s: if you're looking backwards yes that's
1384.08s: where you want to be if you're looking
1385.44s: for we're basically at the peak point in
1388.88s: inflation keep in mind inflation at that
1390.56s: point was 20
1392.00s: or what had been in 1981
1394.96s: so i said
1396.40s: you know
1397.52s: where most managers were saying we need
1399.12s: inflation headstocks
1400.96s: i said we're at the maximum point for
1403.68s: inflation
1405.20s: everything going forward the rate of
1407.04s: change you know the the forward-looking
1409.52s: change is going to be away from
1411.20s: inflation even though you're going to go
1412.56s: maybe from 20 to 18 and then 18 to 16
1417.44s: you know so you're still going to have
1418.48s: high inflation you're moving
1420.88s: on a rate of change basis away from
1422.88s: inflation
1424.24s: and i said basically the fed
1426.56s: will you know is committed to taking
1428.64s: inflation down ratcheting inflation down
1430.88s: over time not over a few years but over
1433.12s: a cycle or two or three
1435.36s: and so
1436.96s: i said what you want to own
1438.88s: if this is the peak of inflation
1441.36s: is you want to own those things that got
1442.96s: beat up by inflation so that means
1444.88s: growth stocks that means you know
1446.88s: particularly the consumer growth stock
1448.72s: so i was buying
1450.24s: coca-cola at book value i was buying
1452.80s: water labor which was a big
1454.88s: drug company at book value i was buying
1456.72s: merc at book value i was buying
1459.20s: um
1460.32s: i'm trying to think of some of the other
1462.00s: names i had but they were basically
1464.40s: uh carnation was one just a food company
1468.16s: they were things that were really flat
1470.24s: on their butts because inflation had
1473.12s: really damaged them
1474.88s: and but i was looking at what was going
1477.28s: to happen going forward
1479.36s: and that
1480.40s: two things really helped my portfolio
1482.64s: one was i didn't have the things that
1484.32s: became laggards the things that were
1486.00s: dragging down other portfolios meaning
1488.40s: energy
1489.84s: you know that had peaked and was now
1492.24s: over a long period of time going to be
1493.92s: distributed right
1496.24s: and i had the things that were beginning
1498.40s: to be accumulated so what happened from
1501.44s: 1982 to
1503.24s: 1991
1505.20s: is you had some of those growth stocks
1507.52s: go through the roof you know you had a
1508.96s: big long growth stock
1511.04s: consumer growth stock cycle where all
1513.52s: the brand name companies did
1515.04s: exceptionally well
1516.96s: and when i bought them they they were
1518.72s: hated nobody wanted them so you know
1521.36s: very early on and i had been before i
1523.36s: got the text around i've been contouring
1525.36s: you know
1526.40s: it just comes naturally to me to want to
1528.88s: be where other people aren't
1531.44s: um and to want to as as wayne gretzky
1534.56s: used to say
1535.76s: you know what makes me great or want
1538.08s: people to ask why he was so good he said
1540.32s: i
1541.04s: i skate to where the puck's going not
1543.20s: where the puck is you know and
1545.92s: it's kind of like that you want to look
1547.92s: ahead
1549.04s: not focus on
1550.96s: backward or as i call it rear view
1553.44s: mirror investing
1555.04s: or sometimes i called extrapolation
1557.36s: fever people extrapolate current trends
1560.08s: to the to the future
1562.16s: and a lot of times if you're at a
1563.44s: turning point that's the worst thing you
1564.80s: can do
1566.72s: that it's
1568.24s: yeah i mean it makes so much sense and
1570.56s: it feels like traders we hear that from
1573.28s: so many different places and you know
1575.04s: folks that follow the markets and then
1577.12s: you know there it is everybody's there
1578.48s: with like their technical analysis which
1580.24s: is all historic in nature you know it's
1582.56s: just it's historic
1584.64s: it's historic and it's typically
1586.24s: momentum driven
1587.68s: yep so
1588.64s: if you're if you're at an inflection
1590.48s: point
1591.44s: that's the last thing you want to do is
1592.80s: go with the momentum because it's going
1594.32s: to reverse
1595.36s: right yeah that's
1596.84s: that's i don't know i i look at that and
1600.08s: it sounds it's those are the kinds of
1602.00s: things that in hindsight
1604.32s: it's like yeah that's the obvious move
1606.40s: but i feel like what people don't
1609.12s: capture when people like you say those
1611.36s: things is
1612.40s: just the amount of conviction you had to
1615.60s: have to actually be a contrarian to
1618.16s: actually do something that everybody
1620.64s: else was kind of nervous to do
1622.88s: um
1623.92s: again just from like a personal
1625.28s: perspective i would be really curious
1627.84s: to just dive into that a little bit more
1629.68s: to understand
1631.36s: you know the the concept behind looking
1634.00s: forward projecting you know in terms of
1636.56s: your best assessments where the market
1638.24s: is going not where it's been
1640.48s: um but
1642.16s: how do you reconcile with yourself in
1645.52s: making those decisions when you look
1647.36s: left and look right and the trend
1649.76s: everybody else is stocking up on oil and
1652.64s: you're like well you know i don't know
1654.00s: about oil it doesn't seem like it's
1655.44s: going to be the next big thing do you
1656.48s: think
1657.60s: that your conviction was just well i
1659.12s: think this is going to happen so i'm
1660.24s: going to go with it or like how did you
1662.00s: get comfortable being that person that
1664.40s: is the contrarian in that scenario
1667.44s: that particular case it was um you know
1670.56s: i had
1671.60s: my certainly my
1673.36s: my um
1675.28s: mba was in chicago so i had a monotris
1678.56s: kind of
1679.84s: um
1680.80s: background coming in
1682.88s: um
1684.00s: and
1685.28s: you know what the fed was doing i i
1687.76s: really from early on was a fed watcher
1690.32s: and uh
1691.20s: somebody who really was fascinated by
1693.28s: macro so i felt my macro by the time i
1695.60s: was
1696.40s: you know eight or ten years into the
1697.92s: business
1699.44s: i had a pretty strong macro background
1702.00s: so i had that part of it
1705.12s: where i looked at the feds they're very
1707.20s: committed to inflation winding out
1709.28s: inflation not quickly but you know over
1711.44s: time
1713.68s: so that that was the macro side of it
1716.08s: that said
1717.12s: yeah if you're going to see inflation
1718.72s: peak here and ratchet down over time
1722.00s: you want to what benefits from that
1727.52s: so that's the one side of the coin the
1729.92s: other side of the coin is really the
1731.52s: investor psychology side of the coin
1733.52s: which is understanding
1735.28s: how much psychology plays a role in
1737.12s: investing and how how much it plays a
1738.96s: role in prices um and and being i always
1742.48s: say i think i'm a natural contrary
1745.28s: in that
1746.40s: i would say
1747.76s: probably 90 of people
1749.92s: are not
1750.84s: comfortable um
1753.28s: marching to their own drummer they're
1754.96s: not comfortable being outside the crowd
1758.08s: they they may say they are but when push
1760.16s: comes to shove they're not comfortable
1762.16s: if they're way apart from the crowd i've
1764.24s: never had that problem it doesn't bother
1766.08s: me
1767.12s: if ever in fact you know certainly
1769.12s: through 48 years now doing this
1772.08s: the times when i know i'm right or when
1773.84s: i'm going to have most success
1775.68s: is when people are calling me a fool and
1777.52s: saying
1778.40s: you know
1779.44s: because psychology has taken over the
1781.36s: narrative
1782.40s: and and crowd psychology and so
1785.12s: it's it's when nobody agrees with me
1787.36s: that i usually have my best success
1790.32s: that i i i literally love that it's
1792.64s: something that i talk a bit about on at
1796.24s: least with my audience it's just
1798.16s: investors slash trader psychology and
1800.48s: kind of really understanding ourselves
1802.72s: but then also understanding that
1805.12s: a lot of the models that we use even you
1807.68s: know in derivatives with the black
1809.44s: shoals model pricing a lot of things are
1811.84s: built around
1813.68s: people that execute in a very specific
1816.80s: logical way and you know a big
1820.40s: disjointed function of that is the fact
1822.48s: that
1823.28s: you know the the markets really aren't
1825.44s: rational all the time there are plenty
1827.36s: of instances where there is like human
1829.92s: psychology that's integrated in one way
1832.40s: or another um and it like i i feel like
1835.60s: that effect can't really be overstated
1838.00s: because a lot of folks still look at
1839.36s: their models and stuff and say well why
1840.96s: is this happening this isn't you know
1842.64s: right
1843.68s: and then they've you know they fail to
1845.60s: remember that the the markets even
1847.92s: institutions and stuff they're still
1849.52s: people
1850.56s: and there's still an inject of the human
1853.36s: psyche in you know what's going on i i
1856.40s: that really resonates you know that that
1858.08s: part of the message
1859.52s: yeah the other thing that i think most
1861.44s: people don't understand most investors
1864.00s: don't understand
1865.68s: and a lot of even professionals i think
1867.52s: forget
1868.88s: is the stock market or any market is a
1871.84s: discounting mechanism
1873.76s: so it's discounting things way ahead of
1877.36s: the time that it occurs
1878.96s: the stock market in particular
1880.88s: will be discounting things sometimes six
1882.88s: months out
1884.32s: and yet the way people think and it's
1887.44s: helped along by the cnbcs of the world
1890.48s: is they think that market movement is
1892.48s: based on today's news so right because
1895.04s: every day they get a some you know they
1896.64s: get a summation of what happened today
1898.48s: and they always tell you the reason why
1900.08s: it happened
1901.04s: except in you know in the
1902.96s: in the scheme of things in the longer
1905.04s: scheme of things
1907.12s: what's going on in the market today
1908.64s: maybe discounting what's going to happen
1911.12s: you know three to six months out
1913.28s: because there are lots of things you can
1915.28s: lots of factors you can look at
1917.68s: um what we call um
1920.56s: second derivative items you know rate of
1922.80s: rate of change things like that that
1925.28s: investors look at or or analysts look at
1928.32s: so
1929.12s: it's very hard for retail investors to
1931.60s: understand why
1933.04s: markets
1934.40s: don't don't move the way logically they
1936.96s: expect them to so like today or this
1939.52s: week
1941.92s: i had somebody asked me on twitter just
1944.08s: today
1945.20s: can you explain to me
1947.52s: why
1948.64s: um
1949.68s: you know
1950.56s: paul's telling us he's going to
1952.16s: accelerate taper and do double the taper
1955.20s: and and the tightening is going to come
1957.04s: sooner
1958.80s: why did interest rates go down on that
1961.60s: you know they can't quite fathom you
1964.16s: know i thought if he's tightening rates
1965.68s: are going up and i said no it's you know
1967.84s: it's a couple things but
1969.52s: um it's it's the street looking
1972.08s: at the fact that if he's tightening he
1974.24s: may actually slow the economy
1976.56s: um
1977.36s: and that's you know going to help bonds
1979.76s: and you can slow inflation and secondly
1983.28s: his actions are hitting the stock market
1986.24s: you know his comments
1988.08s: and so it's you know basically it's uh
1991.12s: they're they're buying bonds
1993.04s: as a safety you know they're they're
1994.80s: looking at a risk off a risk-off moment
1997.52s: so
1998.24s: so it's a lot of times you have to kind
1999.68s: of look further than what's obvious
2002.56s: um
2003.68s: but going back to psychology i get a lot
2006.16s: of questions about
2007.84s: you know because i've been around so
2010.00s: long what what books
2012.32s: taught you to do what you do and how how
2014.24s: did you get here can i have those books
2016.24s: can you give me a list of books and i go
2018.40s: i only recommend basically one book
2021.12s: as i read it in 1977
2024.00s: i was already contrarian at that time
2026.32s: but it really resonated with me that it
2028.48s: spoke my language it was a book called
2031.60s: at that time it was called the
2032.96s: psychology of the stock market by david
2035.12s: dream
2036.00s: david dreaming had been a
2038.24s: a forbes uh columnist you know a
2040.40s: syndicated forbes columnist but
2042.88s: um
2044.16s: he has written many you know it's been
2046.96s: revised many times i think the last
2048.96s: revision is maybe 1998
2051.60s: and it's called contrary investment
2053.44s: strategies now so it's a different title
2055.36s: but i and i've only read the original
2057.36s: but i think it's pretty much the same
2058.72s: book
2060.48s: and i i recommend that to any investor
2063.84s: particularly any retail investor
2066.56s: it really
2067.84s: he does a very good job of explaining
2070.72s: how much psychology plays a role in
2073.36s: investing and in the stock market uh and
2076.56s: i think that is the
2078.40s: most important lesson that investors
2080.80s: need to learn because they they really
2083.12s: can't
2084.32s: they don't understand the psychology and
2086.24s: how that impacts
2088.32s: it's funny you mentioned that book
2089.68s: because that's that's actually one um
2092.00s: that my mentor spoke about a little bit
2093.60s: and it's the original version i i
2095.44s: actually didn't know that it be that
2096.96s: there was revised into the contrarian
2098.80s: investment strategies i i i gotta check
2100.88s: that one out because he used to share
2102.88s: you know pieces of of the older version
2104.80s: with me but i actually be really curious
2106.64s: to see how it's
2108.08s: you know evolved over time because i
2109.84s: think a lot of i don't know even the
2111.52s: nature of being a contrarian i feel like
2113.52s: has changed over time um with
2117.44s: how far you take the concept of being a
2119.92s: contrarian so that's i'm glad you
2122.16s: mentioned that book thank you because i
2123.52s: i definitely will check that one out
2126.24s: um so then we're moving along in your
2128.88s: career a little bit you ended up
2130.48s: shifting kind of to to macro analysis
2134.24s: macro view
2135.76s: of of the markets
2138.00s: what drew you that direction
2140.72s: yeah it's kind of personal story but my
2142.40s: daughter
2143.44s: became very ill
2146.00s: with
2146.88s: lyme disease and
2148.96s: missed high school basically she went
2150.72s: from
2151.68s: top top
2152.96s: student in her class in her grade in a
2155.68s: in a good school system in connecticut
2157.92s: and um
2159.36s: olympic development level soccer player
2161.36s: wanted to play division one soccer
2163.36s: and at the end of eighth grade got
2164.80s: diagnosed with lyme disease we didn't
2166.88s: realize for several months what was
2168.96s: going on yeah um and um she ended up
2172.64s: missing high school she missed five
2174.16s: years of school
2175.44s: because it and people don't realize but
2177.36s: it's it's a neurological disease it gets
2179.52s: into the nervous system my dad really
2182.40s: can really
2183.60s: she had severe fatigue to the point
2185.60s: again this was a highly tuned athlete
2188.16s: she played basketball softball and
2191.36s: soccer and soccer in particular
2194.00s: year-round and
2195.60s: there were times when i had to carry her
2197.44s: up to bed because she didn't have the
2199.04s: energy to climb the stairs so it was a
2201.76s: real dramatic change for us
2204.08s: and i just made the choice to stay home
2207.68s: uh and look for answers and get her
2210.40s: turned around and it took a lot longer
2212.64s: than i expected but i had a friend that
2216.56s: had covered me on wall street and he
2218.72s: said if you want to be our strategist
2220.32s: come on you know come on in
2222.40s: um you can work from home and and do
2224.72s: your your work there so that that was
2226.96s: really what what triggered me going from
2229.36s: what's known as the buy side to the sell
2232.08s: side in terms of you know as a suicide
2234.08s: strategist for a firm in new york
2238.32s: sorry to hear that that's yeah that
2241.44s: yeah good news is she in five years i
2243.84s: became i mean uh to this day i'm a lyme
2246.88s: disease advocate patient advocate and
2249.60s: ran sport groups from 2004
2252.48s: until
2253.68s: um now
2254.88s: um to help people
2256.96s: um and you know have
2259.44s: been very involved in and you know
2261.84s: looking for answers and staying up to
2264.32s: speed on research and things
2268.00s: but she she ended up turning around she
2270.08s: got her ged she like i said she
2271.76s: literally missed five years of school
2273.20s: got her g yeah
2274.64s: scored really high on her sats in spite
2277.60s: of
2278.32s: basically an eighth grade education
2280.40s: plus plus a few other classes um and she
2284.32s: ended up graduating with an economics
2286.80s: and chemistry degree
2288.80s: uh with a 4.0 from
2291.84s: school so
2292.96s: she you know she was that kind of kid
2295.44s: which she just didn't give up she didn't
2297.68s: right and get her down
2299.68s: um you know took a lot away from her she
2302.16s: you know that was my passion i wanted to
2303.76s: play soccer and i never got a chance to
2305.84s: even play high school so you know she
2308.08s: had those kind of things but she
2310.08s: she made the best since she's you know
2311.60s: she's a mom of three boys now so she's
2314.00s: doing pretty good that's awesome yeah
2316.08s: sometimes you know we we might have like
2318.00s: a specific projection for life and then
2320.88s: life does what life does adds a pretty
2323.04s: good curveball just out of curiosity did
2325.04s: she get lyme disease from a tick or was
2326.56s: it something else
2328.08s: yeah we lived on eight acres in in
2331.12s: connecticut and connecticut's kind of
2333.20s: the epicenter
2335.28s: and
2336.56s: at the time
2338.00s: um
2339.04s: i didn't know what i know now about lyme
2341.36s: and unfortunately the 99 of the public
2344.08s: doesn't know because
2345.92s: the establishment doesn't put out good
2347.76s: information
2348.88s: um but if you catch it early and treat
2351.28s: it
2352.00s: properly and those are key words because
2354.96s: you can treat it improperly even though
2357.12s: you catch it early but if you catch it
2359.20s: early and treat it aggressively you can
2361.28s: knock it out and never have a problem in
2363.44s: her case we didn't really catch it until
2365.68s: a year into it so it had gotten into her
2367.68s: nervous system and really wreaked havoc
2370.08s: i mean we saw a kid who was
2372.16s: really
2373.52s: the top student in the class
2376.16s: for five years was a special ed student
2379.04s: for three years she said i can read this
2380.88s: to that but i can't tell you what it
2382.32s: means anymore right i can't i can't
2384.48s: follow it so it's it's i will tell you
2387.12s: an awful lot of alzheimer's an awful lot
2389.52s: of dementia you see you see um if you go
2392.32s: on cape cod or somewhere in nursing home
2394.40s: you'll see 45 year old men with dementia
2397.84s: i guarantee it's lyme disease
2399.68s: undiagnosed um
2401.60s: you know a lot of a lot of what we're
2403.52s: seeing with long-haul clovid is kind of
2405.92s: what we saw with lyme disease
2408.00s: it's interesting i just remember um i'm
2410.00s: like i said i'm from new york and uh my
2412.16s: dad and i we would go hunting and one
2413.76s: time like we always try to check each
2415.36s: other over for ticks especially on your
2416.72s: back and stuff and i remember we we
2418.88s: plucked one off at him but then like two
2420.56s: days later he had that big old dinner
2422.40s: plate red bull's eye there and we're
2424.08s: like uh-oh
2426.08s: and he's we're we're
2428.80s: polish in descent so you know making fun
2431.12s: of ourselves a little bit he just said
2432.88s: that you know whatever you know just
2434.24s: completely ignored it and sure it
2436.56s: started becoming a big issue so that's
2438.32s: why i was curious i just remember in the
2439.92s: northeast
2441.36s: the tips
2443.52s: it's all over the country now but it's
2445.60s: the northeast is really the epicenter
2447.60s: and new york's loaded
2449.20s: um
2450.16s: you know new england's loaded yeah but
2452.80s: it's but it's down in texas it's out in
2454.72s: california it's down south um
2457.68s: and i can't tell you i won't spend time
2460.00s: here saying it but
2461.60s: the cdc and the establishment are
2464.08s: just so wrong-headed on it and they put
2466.24s: out stuff that they you know it's just
2468.72s: it's really if people knew
2470.96s: what this caused there's an awful lot of
2473.20s: what we call autoimmune disease right
2476.32s: you know the ms's of the world
2478.64s: an awful lot of that is
2480.72s: undiagnosed i say lyme disease but it's
2483.28s: really tick-borne disease because the
2484.72s: ticks bring in several different
2486.32s: neurological diseases gotcha and and
2489.76s: because
2491.60s: they don't the cdc will and the
2493.68s: infectious disease i refuse to accept
2495.76s: that lyme can be
2497.68s: long lasting as an infection even if you
2500.16s: treat it it can evade the
2502.48s: the treatment
2504.08s: they they just say three weeks in a box
2506.00s: if you still say you have online then
2507.44s: it's in your head you know you just
2508.80s: imagine it so
2510.32s: so you really have
2511.92s: chronic lyme disease is a very serious
2514.40s: problem that's not really being
2515.92s: addressed properly it's interesting yeah
2518.72s: it's really interesting it my dad
2520.40s: definitely fell in that same category
2521.92s: just where he definitely didn't treat
2523.36s: her right looking back at it
2525.76s: um yeah there are specials i always say
2527.76s: to people if you have cancer you go to
2529.76s: an oncologist you don't go to your pcp
2531.92s: right the same it's the same thing with
2533.68s: this you can go to what we call lyme
2536.00s: literate doctors that are the ones in
2538.00s: the trenches that know how to treat this
2539.60s: long term
2540.80s: um and you know they know the tricks and
2543.12s: they know the the
2544.80s: proper treatments if you go to your pcp
2547.28s: they're going to give you you know
2548.64s: standard infectious disease guidelines
2551.28s: and and again if you catch it very early
2554.32s: that might do it but if you have it in
2556.16s: chronic form
2557.44s: it's impossible to treat that way
2559.52s: right yeah it needs more robust
2561.52s: protocols
2562.96s: yep well it's really good to hear that
2564.96s: she you know
2566.72s: got her life
2567.84s: in a in a better spot for herself and
2569.76s: move forward that's honestly those
2571.60s: stories are always really awesome to
2573.44s: hear in that sense we get a lot of it
2575.44s: you know from the military there's dudes
2576.96s: that go through these horrible scenarios
2578.56s: and some of them just find this magical
2580.24s: way to rebound i always find those
2581.60s: people just to be really inspirational
2583.92s: so
2584.72s: um thank you at least for sharing her
2586.56s: story too because that is inspirational
2588.48s: to hear
2589.60s: sure um so
2591.28s: something that a few of um the folks
2594.32s: from my audience are like really curious
2596.16s: about is
2598.32s: obviously last year with covert and all
2600.80s: that super unique
2603.36s: scenario that that we experienced and
2606.24s: throughout this year in a lot of ways it
2608.48s: seemed at least to me a bit of an
2610.00s: anomaly in certain instances but
2612.64s: um i'd love to start to just get an
2615.60s: understanding of how you view the
2618.32s: markets in 2020 you know looking back at
2621.44s: the whole year like what did you see
2622.88s: that you were like
2624.00s: you know that kind of stood out to you
2626.72s: yeah i came into 2020
2630.00s: um with a view that we were going to
2631.92s: have a melt up
2633.36s: probably first half of 2020 and then and
2636.00s: then a global bust and a you know a big
2639.12s: bear market
2640.88s: um
2641.68s: in february
2643.68s: i said you know if you remember the
2645.60s: market was moving
2647.20s: and up
2648.00s: and up and you know it kept it i kept
2651.04s: saying it's going to come down and they
2652.64s: then people started picking on me
2654.16s: because i was for for weeks saying i
2656.88s: think we're you know we're near the top
2658.56s: it should roll over and it kept going
2660.08s: higher
2661.04s: and they said no you're you're you're
2663.12s: melt up is happening now and i said no i
2665.60s: i just there's too many people on the
2667.60s: bandwagon right now
2669.28s: um so in february i was talking about a
2671.12s: 10 correction
2672.88s: and then we got the 10 correction from
2674.88s: whatever was 3 300 down to the 3 000 or
2678.00s: slightly under is what i was looking for
2680.32s: and i go great i look great this is
2682.08s: exactly what i called you know and
2684.32s: and um
2685.68s: and you know unbeknownst to me that that
2688.16s: turned into a 30 35 correction so
2692.00s: i don't claim credit because i i thought
2694.00s: 10 were all we're going to get or maybe
2696.48s: a little more than that so i get you
2698.40s: know people were picking on me for well
2700.48s: you didn't see this coming you know what
2702.24s: right yeah all of a sudden the same
2704.48s: people that were were picking on me for
2707.60s: or you know give me give me a grief for
2711.36s: you know calling for a correction that
2712.64s: wasn't coming
2714.00s: now it's giving me grief because i
2715.52s: called for two smaller corrections so um
2718.72s: so but in march of 2020 when we when we
2722.40s: saw in three weeks the market go from
2724.40s: that top
2725.44s: down 35 percent three weeks
2728.16s: um it would have been easy for me to say
2732.40s: i guess we had our melt up i guess we
2734.72s: had our top you know we're not going to
2736.16s: get the real melt up i expected
2738.56s: and now we're heading into the bust
2740.56s: because you know what it looked like
2742.40s: then it was really a bust and it would
2745.04s: have been easy for me to switch gears
2747.04s: and say
2749.04s: uh you know i guess i was you know a
2751.44s: little
2752.48s: um premature and or looking for a little
2755.44s: more than we're getting and this thing
2756.96s: is rolling over sooner than i expected
2759.52s: and i got to switch gears and become
2760.96s: bearish
2761.84s: i
2762.96s: i looked and i said can that really be
2764.80s: the case and i looked at my work and i
2766.88s: uh there was just a sentiment that
2768.72s: turned so negative so fast
2770.96s: and stuff i still and it had broken you
2773.28s: know from a technical standpoint it had
2774.88s: broken some important trend lines so it
2777.12s: would have been easy for me to go
2778.64s: bearish
2779.84s: but i looked and i said and this comes
2782.08s: with again
2783.92s: how much i put stock in sentiment
2786.96s: and i said the sentiment is
2789.36s: rock bottom this is the kind of
2790.80s: sentiment we see at bottoms not tops
2793.68s: and
2794.48s: and i'm not talking about short term i'm
2796.08s: talking about important bottoms
2798.16s: so
2798.88s: i said no it looks like all we're
2800.48s: getting here which the market likes to
2802.16s: do is it's a fake out it's a fake
2803.84s: breakdown
2805.36s: and so
2806.48s: when almost the entire street was
2808.88s: calling for a lower like into the teens
2811.44s: on the s p
2813.28s: i said this is the bottom 2 2200
2816.48s: and
2817.76s: and i
2818.96s: i am sticking with my melt-up target of
2821.36s: something over 4 000 this year so i
2824.48s: expected we were going to go from 2200
2827.12s: back up
2828.16s: and see something over 4 000
2830.64s: maybe before the end of 2020. it
2832.80s: obviously took longer
2834.72s: but i i raised my i think i had a 4200
2838.56s: 4200 target on the s p
2841.36s: i
2842.24s: uh then raise that to 4500
2846.40s: then i raised it again this is over the
2848.24s: course of the last 18 months to 4700 or
2850.96s: 800
2852.40s: and right now i'm at and then 5000 right
2855.04s: now i'm at 5300 on the s p so and it's
2858.80s: all been part of that same
2861.04s: scenario
2862.64s: um
2866.00s: sorry i was just i was just throwing up
2867.68s: a chart so everybody could kind of
2868.80s: follow along some of the prices that
2870.48s: you're you're saying it makes a little
2871.68s: easier
2872.72s: sure yeah so so from that 2200 back in
2876.00s: march where you see the the waterfall
2878.24s: cascade down there
2880.16s: um yeah i expect that over the course of
2882.72s: the next
2883.84s: six to 12 months we'd get up over four
2885.84s: thousand maybe forty two hundred
2888.40s: as we progressed through
2890.48s: it became obvious to me particularly
2892.32s: with all the money that was being thrown
2894.16s: into the system
2895.52s: and all the fiscal expansion
2898.16s: that this thing had more legs than that
2900.24s: so i raised it to 4 500.
2902.64s: um and i did these i didn't do it when
2904.80s: we got there i i probably raised it to 4
2907.36s: 500 before we got to 4 000.
2910.24s: and then i raised it to 5 000 before we
2912.48s: got to 4300 i think
2915.20s: um and people think you know somehow i'm
2918.72s: you know
2919.68s: that's wrong that you shouldn't be
2921.20s: changing your targets and i said i'm
2923.12s: moving it as the evidence points to it
2925.68s: right
2926.48s: i'm not going in the other direction i'm
2928.16s: going higher and i'm doing it well
2930.32s: before i reach my original target so
2933.12s: um
2933.92s: and so i'm now at 5300 and i think i'm
2936.32s: probably going to end up raising it
2938.16s: again
2939.12s: my expectation is we'll be in a melt up
2942.16s: following this i called this pullback i
2944.48s: got
2945.20s: beat up in november because it wasn't
2946.88s: coming
2947.84s: i said you're going to have probably a
2949.60s: six percent pullback in the s p and
2952.00s: maybe a little more in the nasdaq
2954.64s: and then and then i expect
2957.28s: a final leg up into a top
2960.00s: and i call this a 39-year secular bull
2962.72s: market top
2963.92s: in other words we started the bull
2965.60s: market in august 1982 what i was talking
2968.24s: about when i was at textron yep that was
2970.40s: the beginning of this secular bull
2972.00s: market we've had cyclical bull markets
2974.16s: through
2975.04s: you know many cycles here
2976.96s: but the full secular move started in
2979.28s: august of 82
2981.04s: and i think will end in 2022.
2985.36s: man that
2987.12s: so then that's a
2989.20s: every time i like zoom out far enough i
2991.04s: look at anything you know from 2009 plus
2993.20s: this just looks
2995.04s: just very interesting to me you know
2996.96s: just an absolute bleed up
2999.20s: um
3000.16s: so something i'm here oh sorry go ahead
3002.72s: yeah so what happens at the end of a big
3005.12s: cycle uh you know
3006.72s: not a not a
3008.24s: cycle like 2009
3010.08s: to now
3011.04s: but a big secular move what happens is
3014.48s: as you move towards the end of that
3017.12s: um
3018.00s: you
3019.04s: you go parabolic so the smoke gets
3021.68s: steeper and steeper and that the the
3024.24s: last
3025.04s: leg of this bull market if i'm correct
3028.24s: is going to be almost vertical so you
3030.16s: you will cover i think
3032.00s: a move from let's say we're
3034.24s: you know
3035.12s: um we're around 4 500 now on the s p
3038.88s: let's say we move up um
3041.44s: to
3042.64s: um 5500
3045.76s: i think you'll cover that ground that's
3047.76s: a thousand points
3050.32s: in somewhere between
3052.80s: three and six months and maybe and i'm
3055.04s: thinking it may be closer to three than
3056.96s: six
3059.36s: what role do you think
3061.60s: um
3062.48s: this is a little bit of a
3065.84s: sidestep i want to come back to this
3067.44s: conversation but i just something i'm
3069.52s: really curious about for folks like you
3071.92s: what role do you see
3074.32s: retail traders playing in the overall
3078.08s: market development and i say that
3080.00s: because you know i've been reading uh
3082.32s: a bunch of white papers that talks about
3084.56s: you know the advent of things like
3086.64s: gamifying trading or gamifying stock
3089.60s: buying you know apps like robinhood
3092.16s: and some folks are speculating that with
3095.20s: the just significant influx of retail
3097.76s: trader money as a whole obviously a lot
3100.00s: of retail traders as individuals don't
3102.00s: really you know count for much but as an
3105.04s: entire group they start to matter you
3107.44s: know at least a little bit
3109.12s: do you think that
3111.28s: that affects your projections in terms
3114.00s: of the market movement or do you think
3116.00s: that you know they're kind of just along
3118.00s: for the ride and the market is still
3119.92s: going to continue to move based off of
3122.48s: just those bigger volume and bigger size
3124.96s: trades you know institutions hedge funds
3126.88s: things like that
3128.24s: yeah so so my view is as as a country
3131.52s: and one of the reasons on the contrary
3133.12s: and probably a primary reason
3135.36s: is that at bottoms in markets whether
3138.64s: you're talking stocks or bonds or what
3140.48s: have you at bottoms
3142.80s: um
3143.84s: the vast majority of people are bearish
3145.68s: right
3147.28s: at tops the vast majority of people are
3149.52s: are bullish our bulls
3151.52s: so
3152.40s: i just view what's going on in the
3154.24s: retail market with robin hood and the
3156.72s: mems etc the mem stocks etc
3159.68s: it's just a sign of how far along we are
3162.40s: in the secular bull market
3164.48s: it just you know it's more symptomatic
3166.64s: of where we're at
3168.32s: um you know for a long time
3171.20s: investors were skeptical and were
3173.28s: bearish so
3174.48s: for much of the last 10 years we've had
3177.92s: pundits trying to call tops you know
3179.60s: saying we're at the top
3181.36s: and
3182.40s: um and the retail public was
3186.00s: probably because of what happened in
3187.16s: 2009 and
3189.12s: a lot of things that have happened since
3190.80s: but they were skeptical and didn't want
3192.48s: to commit money so they had you know
3194.24s: money market funds have grown to huge
3196.24s: amounts
3197.36s: and a lot of people were
3199.28s: in bonds and not in stocks or were very
3202.64s: you know lightly invested in stocks
3205.28s: and in the last year
3207.44s: you've had that change where the retail
3209.52s: public is coming into the market because
3211.36s: it just became too obvious that they
3213.84s: were missing something so
3215.84s: so i view that as
3217.52s: more of a sign that we're getting near
3219.28s: the top rather than you know a driving
3222.16s: element of the time
3223.76s: that's a really really interesting
3225.68s: perspective on that i literally hadn't
3227.28s: thought about it that way but that
3229.28s: seriously makes a ton of sense because
3230.72s: if there's enough of a draw for those
3232.40s: folks
3234.08s: going off of your your previous comments
3236.16s: on you know the the parabolic nature of
3238.24s: things especially it's so difficult to
3240.32s: get a like with inflation where it is at
3242.24s: least right now to get like a positive
3244.56s: real rate of return it's i mean you
3246.32s: pretty much have to go
3248.16s: into equities in some capacity because
3249.84s: if you're doing anything else
3251.52s: um you know you're bleeding maybe a
3253.52s: little more slowly but inflation is is
3255.52s: kind of killing you so that's that's a
3257.20s: really interesting way to look at that
3259.28s: um
3260.72s: speaking of inflation and i know that
3263.12s: we're we're coming up on time so i have
3264.88s: uh i have a few more questions if you
3266.48s: have you know if you have a few minutes
3268.16s: there's a couple others i have for you
3270.40s: um
3272.56s: how do you view
3274.00s: inflation right now and just the fed's
3278.40s: approach to managing it so we talked a
3280.72s: little earlier you know about starting
3282.64s: to hint towards maybe tightening policy
3284.88s: a little bit but just curious your
3286.56s: thoughts on that
3288.24s: yeah my view is we we've printed so much
3291.44s: money
3292.48s: and there's a lag to when that money has
3294.96s: an impact on inflation so you know
3297.76s: and we print a lot of money in g1 qe1
3300.72s: and qe2 and qe3
3303.52s: but this this last thing since march
3306.00s: 2020
3307.36s: is off the charts i mean we've never
3309.92s: you know the balance the fed balance
3311.52s: sheet
3312.72s: in
3313.44s: october of
3314.80s: um 2008
3317.12s: was
3317.88s: 875 billion today we're at eight and a
3321.76s: half trillion yep and most of that eight
3324.16s: and a half trillion more than half of it
3326.56s: has occurred in the last 18 months
3328.96s: you know it went from three seven to
3330.96s: eight and a half right and it's way
3333.36s: on its way to 10. so
3335.28s: um
3336.24s: so that money with a lag
3339.04s: um does create inflation and i think
3341.52s: that's what we're seeing is inflation is
3342.96s: breaking out for the first time in you
3344.96s: know 30 or 40 years
3346.88s: um after ratcheting down from that early
3349.44s: 1980s high and going from 20 inflation
3353.20s: down to almost zero
3355.28s: we're now back up at talking about six
3357.44s: percent numbers and
3359.60s: obviously and my belief is that we're
3361.76s: going to accelerate from here that we're
3363.36s: probably not done
3365.12s: even though the fed's talking about
3366.88s: taper and probably is going to taper
3370.24s: inflation doesn't react to
3373.20s: um tightening quickly
3375.60s: it you know you've kind of built in some
3377.68s: momentum here so i expect over the
3379.92s: course of the next six months inflation
3381.52s: to go higher
3384.40s: uh and i will keep the fed saying yeah
3386.24s: but then we got to do more um so
3388.96s: um so that's
3391.84s: i think what is going to lead to fed
3394.80s: tightening
3395.92s: and what will lead to the end of this
3398.16s: cycle and what will lead to what i am
3400.96s: calling a global bust
3403.04s: and i define a bust as opposed to
3405.36s: recession
3406.48s: as something that's
3408.40s: um
3409.28s: maybe almost as bad as a depression in
3411.60s: some some magnitude
3413.76s: but happens at the speed of a recession
3416.08s: so it's not drawn out like the great
3418.00s: depression was over a decade it's
3420.40s: something where you'll have the damage
3422.56s: of you know we used the term great
3424.96s: recession for 2009
3427.52s: i'd say the bust is something greater
3429.44s: than the great
3430.56s: great recession but not the length of a
3432.64s: great depression so right so in other
3434.72s: words we're we're looking at in my
3436.40s: opinion
3437.44s: the downturn here
3439.12s: when it comes
3440.88s: has the potential to be the worst in the
3442.88s: post-world war two era
3444.72s: and the worst since the great depression
3446.88s: so you know something pretty bad
3449.44s: um and but happened relatively fast
3453.84s: and the reason i think we get there
3456.64s: is we have
3458.72s: 300 and we i used to say 250 but we have
3461.44s: 300 trillion dollars in global debt
3464.96s: we went from 250 to 300 in just the last
3467.36s: 18 months so we right we have 300
3469.68s: trillion in global debt
3471.52s: we're adding trillions
3473.52s: in in
3474.80s: the tens of numbers
3476.88s: in in a matter of a year i mean that's
3479.20s: that's incredible stuff
3481.12s: nobody can i if i if you ask anybody
3483.68s: nobody could really
3485.68s: give you a hand and have a handle on
3487.92s: what a trillion dollars is right and
3490.16s: yeah we're we're at 300 trillion in
3492.32s: global debt
3494.08s: we're at quadrillions in terms of the
3496.08s: notional value of derivatives
3498.40s: those are both debt and derivatives are
3500.56s: both forms of leverage
3502.48s: right one's leverage on markets one's
3504.40s: leverage on
3505.76s: the economy but
3508.00s: leverage works both ways it enhances
3510.48s: returns on the way up
3512.48s: it really destroys returns on the way
3514.48s: down and it exacerbates things so
3517.68s: so my thing is that what would normally
3520.16s: be a recession turns into something far
3522.80s: worse because of we've never been here
3524.96s: before we've never had
3527.20s: leverage like this not even in
3529.44s: nine we're not even close to those
3532.08s: levels we're way beyond those levels
3534.56s: and we've not had a downturn since 2009
3537.28s: to test
3538.40s: what happens with this kind of leverage
3541.36s: so very simply i think what might have
3543.52s: been a normal recession
3545.76s: turns into something far steeper and
3548.08s: worse
3549.44s: but happens fast because leverage
3551.04s: unwinds fast
3552.80s: and secondly
3554.40s: you've had a
3555.92s: you know pandemic unlike anything we've
3558.16s: seen in our lifetimes
3560.24s: and that pandemic
3562.48s: i mean good god we had a shutdown of the
3564.48s: entire global economy for a quarter or
3567.12s: more
3568.24s: um so what we have is an economy that's
3571.60s: far more fragile
3573.20s: because of the pandemic
3575.44s: coupled with an economy that's far more
3577.28s: leveraged
3578.80s: when you combine that
3580.72s: and then you tighten you may find that
3582.72s: it doesn't take much tightening to
3584.24s: trigger a real big unwind and that's my
3588.00s: thesis anyway that's my expectation so
3591.52s: i'm calling for a second half 2022 for
3594.16s: the bust
3596.88s: what role do you think so something i
3598.96s: saw i think the financial times put out
3600.88s: a just fascinating chart to me um and it
3604.96s: talked it was like showing a declining
3607.52s: graphic essentially of on market
3610.80s: uh volume
3612.24s: so meaning that there's a lot of trade
3614.40s: volume starting to happen off exchange
3617.04s: so via dark pools and things like that
3619.76s: um i'm curious do you think
3622.40s: so i guess i'll give you my hypothesis
3624.24s: on that i think that
3625.92s: your your expectations in terms of the
3628.72s: the decline
3630.16s: although based on probably a much
3632.56s: broader amount of information than what
3634.88s: i'm basing mine on i have a similar
3638.00s: conclusion to you and that there's
3640.08s: likely a rapid unwind in the next 18
3644.24s: months
3645.28s: and one of the things i was thinking
3646.72s: about that um just
3650.16s: made me feel like it was going to be
3651.44s: something we hadn't seen before is just
3652.88s: the amount of off exchange volume that
3655.36s: is starting to be generated because i
3657.52s: just feel like
3658.96s: in those instances whenever we've seen
3660.88s: that happen before when the unwind comes
3663.92s: it's typically just vicious because
3666.64s: there is a ton of selling and then it
3668.56s: starts going on market and off exchange
3671.28s: almost simultaneously i'm curious do you
3673.20s: have an opinion on on just the movement
3676.16s: of volume over time or do you think that
3678.88s: the whole like your whole projection is
3680.88s: bigger than that concept
3683.04s: i i would i would look at it this way
3685.60s: which is that we've had
3687.84s: since since 2009 this
3690.56s: onward and outward move
3692.96s: um and so you've you know you've had
3695.52s: people
3696.84s: accumulating stocks bonds
3699.52s: derivatives what have you
3702.16s: all through the last um
3705.28s: what is it uh
3706.80s: 11 years
3708.64s: so
3710.32s: and then you have an event that has that
3713.04s: unwind get concentrated in a very short
3715.12s: period of time so yeah i
3716.96s: can certainly see where
3718.88s: you know off-market volume
3720.88s: or off-market activity
3724.24s: has never had not been tested
3726.40s: yeah and so it all becomes basically
3729.12s: part of the
3730.48s: illiquidity that you see in a downdraft
3732.80s: like that and
3734.32s: you know what what gives when you have
3736.00s: illiquidity is price you know if you if
3738.40s: you if everybody's on one side of the
3740.08s: ship and they go to the other side of
3741.52s: the ship
3742.72s: um
3743.92s: you know if if everybody's moving as a
3745.92s: crowd
3746.96s: um it means you're not going to have
3748.80s: much
3749.84s: on the other side of that trade to hold
3751.76s: right and then price just caves
3754.40s: so i think we're set up because of the
3757.28s: length of this
3758.72s: steady you know yeah we had march of
3760.96s: 2020 but it lasted you know a month
3764.32s: um three weeks yep um we've had some
3766.80s: selloffs we had december of 2018 or you
3770.32s: know a few months prior that
3772.16s: but but really we've had this steadiness
3775.52s: uh steadily climbing higher and higher
3777.52s: and higher
3778.96s: and then all sudden you have this you
3780.96s: know this one
3782.56s: one time
3784.08s: ketchup move
3785.60s: and i think i think you know we've seen
3787.76s: it in flash crashes this isn't a flash
3789.84s: crasher this is a bear market
3791.84s: but over the course of several months
3794.56s: i can i can see an eighty percent bear
3796.64s: market
3798.08s: interesting
3799.28s: that's right
3800.32s: peak peak to trough yeah now we haven't
3803.20s: had a peak to trough market like that we
3805.68s: i think we declined 60 in 2009
3809.60s: in the s p yep um 29 we had a 90 drop 29
3814.24s: to 32.
3815.84s: um in
3817.28s: 2000 the nasdaq dropped i think 80 or 90
3820.64s: but the whole market didn't the s p
3822.64s: didn't drop nearly much at all compared
3825.36s: to that
3826.40s: right this is this is going to be
3828.96s: a global bear market
3831.36s: where
3832.24s: the whole globe is going to have big
3833.92s: bear markets
3835.44s: and and our 80 percent when i say 80
3838.08s: percent it's 80 in the s p 80 in the
3840.48s: nasdaq 80 percent across the board you
3842.88s: know it's
3843.84s: not going to take very many prisoners
3845.92s: right
3847.84s: it's
3849.84s: i think your projection is it's
3852.64s: interesting to me because i have
3855.92s: especially into 2022 i definitely was
3858.56s: expecting a pullback but a lot of the
3860.88s: information you shared even right now
3863.12s: has changed my thought on a little bit
3865.12s: just in terms of the severity because as
3868.48s: you start adding more detail that you're
3871.20s: picking up on
3872.56s: um that i hadn't necessarily considered
3874.72s: it like it does start to paint you know
3876.64s: a bigger picture it's
3878.40s: it's going to be interesting um
3880.96s: the only thing i caution is i i am
3883.12s: calling for that melt up first right and
3886.24s: and right now it's not hard to sell
3888.64s: people on the idea that we're going to
3890.24s: have a bust or it's not hard to sell
3892.56s: people on the fact that we're gonna have
3893.92s: a big bear market
3895.52s: you know particularly after uh you know
3897.76s: this this most recent sell-off
3900.08s: um
3901.12s: if we run up a thousand points in the s
3903.52s: p and it could be more than that but
3905.04s: something like that in the course of the
3906.56s: next three to six months
3908.88s: that psychology is going to be totally
3910.96s: shifted around where
3912.80s: at the top
3914.24s: i can predict right now at the top
3917.04s: people are going to call me crazy for
3918.72s: talking about a bear market they're
3920.48s: going to say oh no this thing has legs
3922.48s: you know don't you understand there's
3924.24s: right
3925.20s: there's all this stuff going on that's
3926.88s: good in the world and the economy etc so
3929.84s: just know
3930.96s: that it's easy when when things are
3933.04s: going south to to be to see the
3935.92s: negatives
3937.20s: it's going to be very hard to see them
3938.88s: when you know because the market's not
3940.80s: going to be up a thousand points for no
3942.80s: reason it's going to have good news with
3944.56s: it
3945.44s: right
3947.12s: um so one more question um you've
3950.16s: already shared a lot of your thoughts on
3952.48s: 2022 so that was you know one of the
3954.32s: things i wanted to ask you but
3956.08s: if you were to bubble up maybe the top
3959.04s: two or three things that you are looking
3962.56s: for slash
3964.56s: watching for 2022 what pieces of
3967.44s: information what you know sentiments are
3970.08s: most important to you looking into the
3971.68s: next year
3973.92s: uh i don't know i it really is watching
3976.96s: how how the investor evolves with the
3979.76s: market i mean if how sentiment evolves
3982.64s: with the market
3983.92s: as you get to the point where
3986.48s: you have universal view of a bull market
3989.60s: you know the universal bullishness
3992.16s: that's when you want to start
3994.40s: getting nervous
3995.92s: um and you know everybody has to kind of
3998.56s: choose their own point at which
4000.88s: they you know they want to
4003.52s: anticipate this
4006.24s: because
4007.20s: some people
4008.88s: say you know
4010.72s: if we're going to drop 80 percent i want
4012.80s: to i want to get out now because i can't
4014.56s: sleep
4015.52s: what if i'm wrong you know what if it
4017.12s: happens sooner or whatever so some
4018.88s: people will not want to be part of that
4022.56s: um run up to the top other people play
4025.36s: right to the edge
4026.88s: and some will go over the edge and miss
4028.72s: it so i mean everybody's got to kind of
4030.96s: figure that out but
4032.80s: ultimately the things i'm watching for
4034.80s: for a top will be i mean obviously the
4036.88s: fundamentals will be part of it but more
4038.72s: importantly it's it's the sentiment
4041.44s: and the market movement itself
4043.68s: you know when i say vertical i i really
4045.84s: think this is could be has the potential
4048.24s: to be
4049.20s: quite stunning
4050.64s: in terms of how much ground gets covered
4053.12s: in a short time
4054.96s: and that that becomes hard to resist
4057.76s: yeah you know
4058.88s: think about think about a trade you made
4060.88s: somewhere along the line where
4063.04s: you you were right you got in
4065.44s: you were right on that trade
4067.52s: and then you said but i don't want to be
4069.36s: a pig i'm not going to get slaughtered
4071.04s: i'm going to i'm not going to get greedy
4072.48s: i'm taking it now
4074.00s: and you get out in the market and and
4075.84s: that that thing goes up another ten
4077.92s: percent the day after year you know the
4079.44s: next week after you sell it i'm just i'm
4081.68s: smiling what did i do right i'm smiling
4084.48s: because last year after the covet drop
4088.00s: um you know i was like ah you know it's
4090.24s: just a lot of bad news and things like
4091.92s: that and most bear markets are you know
4094.08s: like 250 days plus on average something
4096.72s: like that and we had definitely you know
4098.24s: fallen into that so i was like nibbling
4100.80s: near the bottom and then it just like
4103.04s: just shot up and i was like
4104.88s: what the hell just happened here like
4107.28s: it just so that exact scenario happened
4109.84s: to me last year
4111.44s: yeah it's so easy to beat yourself up
4113.36s: and say well you know why was i
4115.20s: why was i being so nimble why was i
4117.44s: trying to be so careful or right
4119.12s: whatever but ultimately
4121.44s: um
4122.56s: you know
4123.52s: it's
4124.32s: it's gonna be up to people to figure out
4126.40s: what their sleep at night quotient is
4128.08s: and to know
4129.60s: there's a risk reward trade-off here you
4131.52s: know you can you can try to get as close
4133.60s: to the
4134.80s: top as you want
4136.32s: but just know the risk is if you stay in
4138.40s: the party too long
4139.92s: you know you can watch it all go away in
4141.76s: a hurry and i i think that's going to be
4143.76s: the signature of the bear market is i
4147.04s: think this bear market not
4149.20s: i don't use the word crash because i
4150.56s: think that implies things happen
4153.44s: like in a matter of days right not
4155.52s: calling for that
4156.72s: it's going to be a bear market over a
4158.24s: matter of months maybe you know i don't
4160.32s: know whether it'll be
4162.00s: four months six months
4163.84s: eight months 12 months but it'll happen
4166.48s: over a period of time and it won't be a
4168.40s: straight line there'll be
4170.00s: there'll be a bear market rally in there
4171.68s: etcetera
4172.80s: i'm pretty confident saying all that
4175.20s: but
4176.48s: some of those steps down could be you
4178.56s: know you could lose 30 in a week right
4181.36s: um and and so those that say i'm gonna
4184.64s: ride this
4185.84s: and they get caught up in the
4186.96s: fundamentals or get caught up in the
4189.36s: the recommendations that'll be there at
4191.04s: the top
4192.40s: and then miss the top
4194.96s: may say gee why'd i get greedy after the
4197.04s: fact so right so you got to kind of be i
4199.52s: i can't give advice and i don't have
4201.28s: advice to give on that it's really just
4203.20s: kind of play it as it goes along
4205.28s: but everybody has to kind of make that
4207.36s: just the biggest thing they have to do
4209.20s: is understand that
4211.20s: um we're in a later stage of this
4213.84s: and that there is
4215.28s: a pretty big downside that follows this
4218.88s: so i told you i had that last question
4221.76s: and i i apologize because i lied to you
4224.16s: i have one very last question i promised
4226.48s: this time
4227.52s: um
4228.48s: so when you talk about sentiment and
4230.80s: like monitoring sentiment what are some
4232.80s: of the ways you do that
4236.24s: um well probably the
4238.88s: the one seed of the past one is is on
4241.20s: twitter i i know when i'm in pretty good
4244.00s: shape when i'm getting a lot of people
4246.16s: calling me uh you know a tool or a fool
4250.00s: so
4251.04s: um no shortage of criticism on the
4253.36s: internet i can i can give you an example
4255.76s: because i've been i've been you know
4257.84s: calling for i'm probably baseball on
4259.84s: gold and silver on them
4262.16s: you know on the market on the street and
4264.72s: um
4265.76s: and it peaked out last august august of
4268.64s: 2020 came out of the march bottom and
4271.12s: had a great run
4272.64s: i thought we'd have a few months of rest
4274.88s: and then another big leg
4276.56s: well that few months has turned into you
4278.80s: know
4279.52s: 14 months i think um 15 months
4283.12s: so people just want to you know say
4285.68s: you're an idiot and you you know you've
4287.68s: been you're you're a broken record you
4289.68s: keep saying you're bullish and it's
4291.12s: going the other way
4292.64s: but i'm i'm it's it's the asset out
4295.92s: there
4296.88s: that i love and you know in terms of the
4300.16s: what it looks like it's
4301.76s: in my opinion the most under valued
4303.92s: asset
4304.88s: on of all things out there right now
4308.00s: and there are setups that say this thing
4310.40s: could go
4311.68s: uh very very strongly in
4314.72s: the next several months so but
4317.36s: um you know it sold off in the last two
4319.84s: weeks after having a nice run in october
4323.20s: uh into early november it's it's been
4325.92s: basically selling off and i i
4329.52s: saw that coming but i didn't see it
4330.96s: coming quite to this extent
4332.96s: right
4333.92s: and so now that it's it's just having
4336.40s: the psychology effect on people people
4339.04s: have been sitting in gold and silver
4340.80s: over the miners
4342.40s: are feeling a lot of pain
4344.48s: and they just start you know getting
4346.80s: angry it's
4348.32s: so that's once that's one sign of
4350.08s: sentiment is when you see
4352.00s: um
4352.96s: as i have said through 48 years one
4355.36s: thing that i feel
4357.04s: i understand very well is sentiment and
4359.60s: i have made the comment over many years
4362.72s: that
4363.76s: um investor psychology
4366.80s: is the strongest emotion in the world
4369.04s: it's stronger than love or hate
4370.88s: that when
4372.00s: when
4372.80s: something's going against you in a big
4374.72s: way
4376.24s: um financially
4378.40s: there's no bigger emotion the emotional
4382.16s: effect on people than that so
4384.48s: i don't take it personally when people
4386.08s: start slamming me for you know you're
4388.32s: just wrong on gold and silver or
4389.92s: whatever um it's it's you know it's very
4392.80s: predictable psychology
4394.72s: and and i understand it i mean you know
4396.88s: it's at the point at the point they're
4398.80s: looking it looks like it's never going
4400.16s: to end
4402.00s: yeah that's fair it's it's i'm i'm
4403.76s: actually one of those people i'm pretty
4405.52s: bearish gold right now
4407.04s: uh
4407.84s: but
4409.28s: i but again like with your context i can
4412.24s: see why i think one of the biggest
4413.76s: arguments i see
4415.20s: um that's like bearish gold uh with
4418.32s: inflation where it is right now is one
4420.08s: part of the equation but then also
4421.92s: people are starting
4423.76s: to conceive cryptocurrency as like a
4427.68s: better substitute
4429.28s: to gold i i'm not there yet myself i
4431.68s: still think cryptocurrencies are just
4433.68s: way too volatile to serve the purpose
4435.44s: that gold does
4436.64s: but yeah in general to me it just seems
4438.96s: like gold has been having a dog of a
4441.60s: time getting its feet under it but i'm
4443.12s: actually excited i'll i'll be watching
4444.88s: it pretty closely going forward but i am
4446.56s: not going to lie i have been fading the
4448.72s: crap out of it as soon as i see it make
4450.32s: a rally i i'm hammering it
4453.04s: yeah my my forecast for gold
4455.76s: um
4456.64s: over the next six months is 2500
4459.60s: really forecast my forecast for silver
4461.92s: over the next six months is 50.
4464.64s: so so obviously i'm not bearish
4467.28s: yeah i was gonna say i'm gonna just pull
4468.80s: this up real quick so everybody can see
4470.88s: um so this is a
4473.84s: six month daily on on gold so right now
4476.24s: we're hanging like 1780ish so you're
4478.88s: thinking 25 sometime next year
4481.04s: yep that'll be and i mean
4483.84s: if that pairs nicely with you know your
4486.80s: your expectation of
4488.80s: the drawdown you know that definitely
4490.80s: seems within the round yeah actually no
4492.96s: actually not this is this is prior to
4495.12s: the bust oh interesting yeah so i i
4498.32s: expect it to come down with the rest of
4500.80s: the asset structure in the bust in in
4503.36s: the bear market
4504.64s: so
4505.60s: um i i i think it'll hold up much better
4508.56s: than equity so equity is right let's say
4510.96s: 80
4512.32s: you know gold might come back from 2500
4515.12s: back to 1800
4516.96s: um
4517.76s: you know silver might go from 50 back to
4520.00s: 30.
4520.96s: uh so pretty good drop but not back not
4523.52s: all the way back
4524.72s: uh right and then and then following the
4526.96s: bus because what what will have to
4529.12s: happen in the bust
4530.72s: and i call this the most predictable
4532.96s: part of my forecast or the easiest part
4534.80s: to predict
4536.00s: we will see the the fed's balance sheet
4538.32s: grow from eight and a half trillion now
4541.04s: i wouldn't be surprised if it's
4542.88s: certainly 20 trillion maybe 30 trillion
4545.76s: in response to the bust oh got it yeah
4548.88s: so if you have that kind of money
4551.76s: you know that's many times what we saw
4553.28s: in the last 18 months last 20 months
4556.08s: if you have that kind of money it's
4557.28s: going to jump start an inflation cycle
4559.68s: i've i fully expect us to retrace
4562.72s: fully the last 40 years of inflation
4565.12s: disinflation slash deflation
4568.64s: so if we're
4570.56s: in the bus
4572.56s: you could see a little bit of deflation
4574.48s: you could go from this inflation problem
4576.16s: now and actually see a small bit of
4579.20s: deflation short deflation
4581.84s: from there let's say from 2023 to 2030 i
4585.52s: expect we'll go from
4588.00s: zero negatives to
4590.24s: 20 percent plus
4592.48s: that
4597.52s: yeah i fully expect gold to be 10 000
4600.16s: plus could be 20 000 by the end of the
4602.24s: decade
4603.20s: i fully expect silver to be 400
4607.12s: man that's awesome i i like i i love the
4609.76s: way that
4610.88s: i don't know you think about those
4613.60s: the movement of those things because for
4615.20s: me again like my trading window oh like
4618.24s: i don't think it's insignificant but it
4620.08s: is insignificant compared to you and you
4622.64s: know even when people talk about
4623.84s: inflation now we're complaining about
4625.52s: six percent you know what i mean and
4627.76s: you've already seen 20 you know what i
4629.20s: mean so it's just
4630.48s: yeah i'm saying this is this is a mini
4632.40s: inflation cycle yeah because of what's
4634.96s: going to happen with the bust
4636.96s: it's not a straight line that's what i i
4639.04s: talk about that with commodities like oh
4640.64s: right the next cycle is going to be all
4642.08s: commodities
4643.52s: and so yes we've broken out here
4646.24s: um but you've got you've got a bust
4648.88s: between
4650.48s: this commodity run here
4652.96s: and the big commodity run that will
4654.88s: follow the bust
4657.36s: because i'm predicting 400 oil
4660.16s: now the end of the decade so
4662.48s: but before we get there in the bust i
4664.56s: think oil can go back into the 20s
4667.12s: so you you will go from 20 to 400 or 25
4670.08s: to 400
4671.60s: in in you know seven or eight years
4675.04s: uh as i say to people who talk about a
4677.20s: commodity super cycle just be careful
4680.08s: it's like standing on the south rim of
4682.08s: the grand canyon
4683.76s: looking across to the to the um north
4686.64s: rim
4687.60s: and thinking you can walk straight
4688.96s: across
4690.56s: you know you've got that canyon in
4692.00s: between in this case a bust
4694.72s: that means yes you'll have a big
4696.48s: commodity cycle but it's not straight
4698.08s: from here right
4699.92s: right
4701.28s: man that
4702.64s: that's a super fun part of the
4703.92s: conversation i i literally could just
4706.80s: keep going on that so i i did promise
4709.28s: after i lied to you the first time that
4710.96s: the the last one was actually the last
