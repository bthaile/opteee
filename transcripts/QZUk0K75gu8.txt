0.00s: What's up, everybody? Welcome back to another episode of the Outlier podcast. I have my friend,
8.08s: Tom Bassow, back hanging out with us really to ring out the year. This was the last full trading
14.48s: day of 2023. So stoked to finish the year off with you. Thanks for hanging out.
19.68s: Yeah, I just finished up my afternoon run 10 minutes before we got on. So yeah, this is the end of
27.52s: the year. They had it the long weekend now. How was how was your run? What'd you do?
33.84s: Oh, I just did. I had a down day today, but it was a pretty good year. Yeah, that's absolutely
41.52s: awesome. So when you look back at 2023, what stuck out to you? What was anomalous? And the reason
50.16s: why I asked that question is because you've seen a lot of markets, right? So I started trading in
57.68s: 2007 myself, and I know that you've seen much more than I have. So I'm always curious to see
64.56s: what kind of things stuck out to different people with different reference ranges.
69.28s: I think I guess the two major things I noticed was that I completely would have never predicted
77.92s: that the stock market would be almost at new highs at the end of the year. I figured the economy
83.76s: was probably going to go into a more of a hard landing, not a soft landing. And I still don't know
91.76s: that we're going to have a soft landing. I think that's the jury's out still a little bit on that.
96.80s: So we'll see next year how that works out. But the one thing that surprised me is the strike
102.80s: to the stock market because it seems to be running on fumes almost some indicators that are strange.
111.76s: I have a stock index trading strategy. And despite the fact that on the last five, six days,
119.04s: the market has made highs each day up to today. So through yesterday, I noticed that I couldn't get
127.60s: any of my overbought oversold indicators to overbought. I thought that was interesting. It's kind of like
134.40s: the strength isn't there to really peg the indicators out, but it keeps trying to hang on and go
141.44s: up more. Today, of course, it didn't. And we'll see whether that spills over and a lot of tax
148.40s: selling next year or early or what. That was the one thing that was interesting. And that
155.04s: really propelled some of my returns for the year. I wouldn't have expected it. The other thing that
161.52s: was I thought strange and quite profitable and very good for me was that the all-weather strategy
168.00s: trades like 26 different futures markets. And I noticed a number of them just went nuts. Like
175.84s: orange juice had this huge move earlier in the year that blew my mind. And then what goes up
182.64s: comes down. So all of a sudden, it turns around, goes the other way and you make a bunch of money
186.88s: the other direction. Coffee had some big moves. A lot of the soft commodities had some just really
194.24s: violent, just crazy stuff. So that's been helpful for profits. The rest of the stuff, you know,
205.04s: just as a worth worrying about, there were some profitable trades and losers all came out in the
211.44s: wash. I think the big highlights were the some of the soft commodities moves that we saw and then
218.64s: some of the in the stock market through the year end. When you look at your returns for the year,
224.40s: what was the primary driver of the performance? Like a joke around say trends. Trends were the
235.36s: driver. If you have a trend, you can make money if you don't have a trend, you can't.
241.36s: Mostly, I'd say the stocks at the end of the year were huge. The move earlier in the year was
248.96s: profitable, but it stopped me out about half of the positions. So the ones that hung on were really,
255.28s: really quite profitable for the year. The ones that got stopped out, I had to get back in.
260.08s: They're mildly profitable, but through the year end, that was one big area. And the other
265.28s: area, I believe, was the futures. The commodities really had some strange stuff. I mean, you had
274.40s: wheat doing weird things with Ukraine. You had orange juice, crazy coffee, had some crazy stuff.
283.76s: There's been some very interesting moves in the commodity. So that's been very profitable,
290.24s: because the trends are hanging around long enough where you had really coins money off of them.
296.64s: That's probably the two major areas I thought there was quite a little driver of profits.
303.68s: Another question I had for you is what did you make of the move in the beginning of the year? Because
308.96s: I thought it was fascinating, going from the open to the highs that we saw in early February,
317.20s: essentially back to where we opened the year in March. And then obviously it was off to the races
322.40s: from there. But I just thought that that movement followed by what we saw was very curious. I
327.60s: don't know what to make of it. I'm curious if you have any thoughts on it.
329.76s: I, you know, I, I, cars, I just follow my indicators. I don't predict a lot at all, actually,
336.24s: when I'm trading. I, I saw that as a feeble attempt to try to get a bull market going or bull
343.04s: move going and it failing and it stopped out about half of my positions. The hedges actually went on.
351.12s: So I was hedged for a little bit there and then I got whipsod out of the hedge and all the long
357.12s: started coming back in and all of a sudden right now I am 30 out of 30 sectors long. Everything is
363.92s: long. It's clearly that early move was fake out and a test and then then we got back on the
372.40s: train and right through the end of the year it was been just a crazy move up, I think. I have no
379.36s: idea whether it'll be able to hang on in the next year. I'm not going to even bother predicting
384.72s: because it doesn't make any difference for those who want to try to predict. I'd say that
390.08s: all I would worry about is to be ready to react quickly, expect potential for it moving very fast
399.36s: because there's so many people with so many profits built up, so many nervous knellies about
405.60s: what might happen. If you get some tax selling causing it to be loose early going here and then
414.08s: any kind of incident just out of the blue something happens economically, the fed, the wars
423.20s: that we seem to be in, anything could touch off the flame and then all of a sudden man
432.48s: that everybody would be trying to get out the door at the same time, it could get ugly. So I just
438.00s: be very careful here. It just seems to me like there's so much volatility and so much potential
443.68s: for disaster. I just enjoy the ride while you can to the upside and be prepared to do the other if you
449.36s: have to. What do you make of tax overall strength and I want to open the question up a little deeper
458.32s: than that as compared to just 2023 from your studies of the markets. What other references do you have
467.60s: where a single sector has single-handedly done what tech has essentially done over the last five
475.12s: years if anything? Not over the last five but if you go back to 2000 which should be getting
481.20s: ancient history for a guy your age probably. Tech bubble in 1999 2000 that was early internet,
491.84s: earlier internet and the tech stocks were just nuts. They were losing money. There were
499.84s: IPOs were coming out and they'd rate a company hundreds of millions or billions of dollars and
506.64s: they hadn't even made a profit yet. It was just insanity and you know you looked at that and
513.84s: everybody said well yeah this has never happened before and it is very overbought but it's a new
520.80s: it's a new market you know this is never happened before because we never had all this technology
527.84s: that's going to change our lives and all this stuff and eventually the profits will come and
534.32s: the lesson to be learned is the tech stocks ended up going down 80% shortly thereafter. Now if you
543.60s: fast forward all the way to now a few tech stocks like Amazon Facebook or Meta and Google and so on
553.44s: were able to you know figure that out survive that debacle and end up you know making a ton of money
562.40s: over the last couple decades but that kind of what's happening in tech now almost seems to be a
572.72s: little well you know there's the AI spin which I don't know that anybody's making money off of it
580.56s: yet they're pouring a lot of money into it and then you've got the tech stocks in general
588.16s: you've got competitions you've got multi-billion dollar fines coming down from the EU for some of
593.60s: these people you've got I don't you know Amazon's not the powerhouse it was I mean they're trying
603.84s: to now run ads on Amazon Prime to kind of make some more money there you know I think there's
613.52s: going to be competition if the economy goes south then a lot of advertising is going to dry up a lot
621.28s: of Amazon orders are going to still you know kind of dry up a little bit or at least people will
626.64s: spend a little less it could get a little ugly if if everybody gets the momentum going the other
634.00s: way for a while because everything sort of been overdone lately and there's those that will say
643.12s: you know it hasn't been overdone you know we could with AI or with a booming economy all of this
649.60s: stuff could still make even more money and there's new tech stocks that are coming on all the time
655.52s: and they could make money and all that I just think the stock market is very just kind of a little
663.04s: nervous right now and there's just been it's been such a good run and I don't think the economy
671.68s: is going to do that great next year I'm not seeing it I I still think soft landing could be tricky
679.84s: Fed has never been lately the last few decades probably very good at fine tuning the economy I
688.72s: think they'd be better off the economy fine tune itself and sort of get out of the way but if
697.52s: the economy doesn't really if they've gone overboard and the economy slows down and all the numbers
702.72s: start getting ugly and we have down interest rates coming down not because the Fed is pivoting
709.44s: and going to be spurring on the economy but because the economy is just doesn't have the demand for
715.52s: money anymore it's people are people are can't afford a house they can't so you can't get a mortgage
722.80s: if you can't afford a house right I mean so there's now as much demand for mortgage I don't know
728.80s: there's a lot of things that could happen that just seems like the economy could go soft if that
733.52s: happens and it trips up the stock market then it goes soft and you got everything kind of caving in
740.16s: at the same time and then how do you hide from that you if you're just a stock trader long you've
746.08s: got no place to hide you have to just patiently wait it out if you're an all-other trader like me
752.08s: you start looking at other opportunities your short bonds maybe or your long bonds and and trying
758.08s: to get them the lower interest rate cycle you're maybe got gold going on silver maybe you've got
765.04s: platinum you got things you know aluminum to the short side you've got softs maybe if there's
772.08s: inflation you you got a lot of food stocks or food futures that you can deal with so there's
779.12s: profit opportunities out there but you got to be a little bit non-traditional to figure that out
784.64s: what do you make of crude oil here uh well crude oil has been kind of the last few months
793.20s: sort of going on the sideways range it's getting a little soft just real recently I'm last week or
800.80s: so but it's been kind of sideways there hasn't been much major move I earlier in the year there was
806.88s: some nice moves that were profitable but lately it's been kind of trying to figure itself out
812.48s: I noticed a gasoline or unledged gas went to the downside crude oil is going to the downside
819.28s: and natural gas actually broke out to the upside so whatever that means
825.84s: yeah well net gas it always feels like kind of the crackhead of the bunch because you never I feel
831.92s: like you never really know where net gas is going to pop up and what it's going to pop to
837.84s: yeah looking at it from I guess an eckent well a macro perspective what do you think about the
847.28s: extended war in Ukraine and do you think what's going on over there I know we kind of got a bit of
855.76s: a pass so to speak because it was a bit more of a mild winter but if this engagement continues
862.32s: into the next year and we have a less accommodating winter like what do you make of something like that
869.04s: yeah I mean then all of a sudden we need energy and we've done our best to mess up our energy
876.24s: grids and with non fossil fuels that are not reliable they aren't consistent we haven't built
883.84s: nuclear fast enough you know it's ripe for having disruptions and it's people don't realize that I
893.04s: think you know the entire energy industry is on kind of like a couple week to three week turn
901.36s: around I mean you got to get the stuff out of the ground you got to get it through the pipe
904.80s: planes you got to refine it you got to get it out there to burn it and there's not a whole lot of
911.76s: and a long lead time to that you know there's a lead time to drilling and defining new supplies and
919.20s: getting all that set up but once it's set up and producing it's from the time it comes out of the
925.52s: ground of the time it's going into your car it's pretty quick and so it doesn't take much
930.80s: to disrupt it and if you continue to have shortfalls and then you have something like a weather event
937.12s: or a war it's pretty easy to disrupt the prices so I like the market as a trading vehicle because
946.80s: again if markets move you have the potential for profit if markets don't move you can't make a
953.20s: whole lot of money in it so I trade crude oil I trade unwanted gas and I trade natural gas
960.88s: in the energy complex yeah and you brought up an interesting point as well on the the nuclear
967.68s: energy side of things which I find fascinating because I was I live in San Diego and there's some
975.04s: nuclear reactors like right on the coast and they're in the process of dismantling it they're
978.48s: taking them apart and I find that just so hard to understand if we're trying to create a more
985.68s: efficient energy source it seems really difficult to find something more efficient than nuclear
992.80s: reactors at least that we have that scalable right now yet obviously there are disposal issues
999.36s: and that's almost like a future us problem which is always difficult you don't want to kick the
1003.92s: can down the road too far because then you have to reconcile it at some point but it's interesting
1009.76s: to me to see the direction we're going with that what do you sorry yeah go ahead
1014.96s: and in in in California's case I think they're nervous about your nuclear reactors being
1021.68s: near earthquake zones and that's the problem there we have a polarity here over here in Phoenix
1031.84s: is generating lots of lots of cheap power and we're not in an earthquake zone here so it's
1039.60s: there's no discussions of dismantling that or anything I would imagine most people would want to
1045.44s: have more of polarity it's done a great job of keeping our costs down on energy and we sell
1052.48s: something out over to you guys yeah and it's well it's interesting too because I I could see the
1058.96s: the idea of earthquakes but down in San Diego really don't get them we're not near much of those
1065.60s: massive tectonic plates but I was looking at the trend across the US out of curiosity in 1990 there
1071.76s: was 111 reactors and as of 2023 we're down to 93 and it seems like we're continuing that direction
1082.48s: one of my ideas though is I feel like while we might think that's a good environmental decision
1089.28s: in the short term I imagine we'll come to a point where we realize like oh shit this is actually
1095.12s: not working we we're not having a stable system anymore we need to build more of these
1101.04s: is that so like I don't know how closely you follow power I know since you trade futures you probably
1105.92s: have a at least a peripheral understanding of it if not a deeper but I'm curious what you think of
1109.68s: that I came really close to studying in chem nuclear engineering in college that I ended up in
1115.44s: chemical engineering instead it all came down to the scholarship flows from different universities
1123.44s: my best deal was at Clarkson and they didn't have nuclear engineering so chemical was my pick
1128.88s: and I really love chemistry so it was great but then it all worked out me on I can't
1135.76s: kick too much about my life has been pretty pretty blessed the I'd say the the nuclear side of
1143.92s: things is that I think you you got to ask yourself globally and you if you do this in today's
1153.60s: world and you ask yourself with the demand that we have for energy how are you going to supply it
1161.12s: reliably nothing I'm seeing coming out of say the current administration at all at all makes any
1169.52s: sense to provide the amount of reliable energy that would be necessary to do the things that
1176.24s: they seem to want to do like if they want everybody to drive an EV you got to have electricity
1183.76s: we have all sorts of coal fired plants wind energy and solar are not reliable and are not cost
1192.08s: effective they will destroy our economy there's no way you can come up with enough energy to
1199.04s: satisfy the needs in the United States or the world without fossil fuels so with all due respect to
1206.88s: anybody who wants to do something the reality is you can't it won't work nuclear is sort of a
1217.28s: kind of thing where you know you do have some problems with it on disposal but it does generate
1225.44s: inexpensive power part of the reason it is so expensive to put one of those in is all the
1231.92s: regulations and stuff that good environmental impact everything else it seems like the anti-nuclear
1239.28s: crowd has gotten involved in making nuclear reactors very difficult to for new ones to come on
1246.40s: stream but that would probably be the most environmentally friendly probably cost effective once
1254.08s: it's in type of way of producing energy sadly there doesn't the being that doesn't seem to be the
1261.60s: amount of enthusiasm for it that you and I might have yeah and I'm curious if there's going to come
1271.36s: a point where we realize we have to make some changes because I know Elon Musk actually has talked
1275.60s: a couple times about this interesting concept where it's I don't know the exact size but a relatively
1283.04s: small solar farm could be built and power much of the US if it's put in the desert actually I don't
1290.16s: want somewhere in the southwest I don't remember exactly where he's talking about me mean no
1293.20s: a new small nuclear no soul actual solar so I'm curious he and he's and he's convinced he says that
1303.04s: and it's not a big actually let me see if I can find it real quick because it's really interesting
1307.28s: because part of me thinks if his position on that influences stuff like this market where people
1314.56s: might be thinking well if this does work then I mean to Elon's point this would definitely be better
1321.20s: than I would I would disagree in that I've done some research on solar the the amount of solar
1329.36s: in the middle part of the day and I live in Arizona it's sunny three three and 30 days a year here
1335.36s: so we do have some solar but the amount of solar power that actually comes into a square footage
1344.16s: area of the earth unobstructed by clouds or anything else is a certain fixed amount of energy
1353.52s: you can't even capture all that energy yes it I admit it's free collecting it is not free you
1361.76s: got to buy the solar panels and all that and crew its technology they can only get a fraction of
1366.96s: that very limited energy per square foot if you take that and look at what kind of energy needs
1374.96s: you have in the world there's just no way that solar will provide it again yeah he's I found the
1381.92s: line that he was talking about he says this is a quote from Musk during a podcast with Joe Rogan
1387.84s: and it says this is from Elon Musk and he said you can actually power the entire United States with
1394.08s: 100 miles by 100 miles of solar which is an interesting idea obviously you need batteries all
1403.52s: that kind of stuff to support it and I think it's kind of like I think that there's a pretty fair
1409.20s: probability of what we saw with windmills I get that's another thing we have out here is windmills
1414.16s: and a bunch of them just they don't windmill anymore some of them are working some of them aren't
1418.88s: and we found that there's very little juice that's not worth the squeeze for windmills so part of
1427.76s: me is curious if we would find something like that but also who knows you know the the advancement
1432.56s: of technology but I think to your point anyways we have something now that does work we know it
1438.24s: works works really well and we're kind of going the other direction long term the energy
1444.00s: solution to all of this and it would just completely disrupt the world and and turn opac upside
1452.56s: down and everything else would be fusion they've now run fusion energy and created a net positive
1459.84s: and they've replicated it three times in in three separate tests so it's not a fluke it's not
1467.68s: just a measurement problem or anything now that they've replicated it three times now we got to
1473.84s: figure out how to make a fusion plant out of it and keep collecting that energy because now you have
1481.52s: all the fuel in the world right off your shore in San Diego you just take water you get some hydrogen
1488.08s: and where you go and now you've got as much energy as the world whatever need and there's zero pollution
1495.44s: that fusion fusion energy ends up combining together the the hydrogen molecules you end up with
1505.20s: water vapor coming out the other side of the reactor so there's zero radiation yeah I saw a really
1513.12s: interesting thing coming through from Toyota that they had built a hydrogen fuel to car that
1520.40s: essentially works off of this thesis I know that's the no that no I know that one too that's a
1529.92s: hydrogen fuel cell right that would be a different wrinkle it would not be fusion energy fusion energy
1538.16s: you could do in a power plant type setup just like repoliverity over here you could set up a fusion
1545.44s: part of the plant and it would just generate a lot of heat and therefore steam and therefore
1552.96s: drive the turbines and create the electricity and you'd be able to power the grid and if you had
1558.88s: a supply of water you'd have a just a infinite supply of water you'd have an infinite supply of energy
1565.04s: and you would be able to power the earth really easily and once you got it set up if it could
1571.28s: be self-sustaining without a whole lot of moving parts you could really create some very inexpensive
1577.04s: energy and OPEC would just be gone you wouldn't they would lose it yeah power then now when you have zero
1584.48s: or very low-cost-port energy now you have different options for trying to have grids that allow
1594.16s: say electric cars that aren't running on batteries they might you might be able to you know have
1599.04s: commuting with induced electricity into like a driver like a certain railing thing you know it's
1608.48s: hard to imagine what you could do but fusion energy could drive the cost of energy down so much and
1615.28s: make it so abundant that would disrupt the world huge and it for a positive way and it would
1622.88s: get rid of fossil fuels for all those that think there is a global warming or cooling or
1629.60s: climate change or anything that should satisfy them because you're getting no radiation you're
1635.52s: getting no byproducts and you got very inexpensive energy so that would be you know a good thing
1644.16s: there and smog in those types of things would be way down because you wouldn't have any you know
1651.12s: burning hydrocarbons so all good but so far that hasn't happened yet I can't hold it yeah it's I'm
1661.12s: always curious what the what the motivation is behind those things and what I was referencing earlier
1666.40s: actually do want your your thoughts on this is so Toyota they're looking at the hydrogen combustion
1672.16s: engine and really what I was tying it to is the use of water and how we're trying to use water
1677.44s: for different energy sources but what I was reading you probably know this better than me is that
1682.56s: they're seeing that those kinds of engines actually release a lot of nitrogen which leads to
1688.40s: other potential issues which do you think that there is a future for something like hydrogen
1696.32s: combustion engines specifically that you know like the Toyota is trying to develop it's still early
1702.08s: they really get terrible mileage they're underpowered just like the beginning of any you know
1706.40s: combustion engine but I'm sure it's combustion I think it's hydrogen fuel cell
1712.96s: at least the article I'm looking at now calls it hydrogen combustion engines
1717.12s: okay well the air possibility you could do that that would be a little trickier because now you're
1722.00s: going to burn hydrogen which is extremely burnable and you're going to you're going to have to have
1730.80s: that engine be able to withstand the forces of a hydrogen combustion so that yeah it's doable but
1738.16s: I wouldn't think it'd be easy as burning gas so yeah good luck to Toyota probably cost
1743.92s: prohibitive so yeah because the other thing I found in there that was interesting is obviously you
1747.44s: need like these pressure tanks that then if you get into a car crash it doesn't lead to
1754.00s: mini atom bomb going off you know that wouldn't happen actually you have a better chance
1760.16s: and I have an explosion with gasoline than you do with compressed hydrogen is if you crack that
1765.84s: with the hydrogen you would you would pretty much just have an escape of gas and it would be a
1775.12s: a very quick violent little you know like puff and then that would be pretty much it you would
1784.72s: not be able to create a natural explosion to create the explosion I don't think interesting yeah
1793.52s: I think hydrogen actually I think as a compressed gas could be less dangerous than I believe
1803.04s: gasoline is if you have a rear end collision and a gas tank and there's a spark you could blow up a car
1810.72s: right interesting yeah it's I'm actually always fascinated by the different advancements that we see
1820.72s: in auto because to your point when I think about something like OPEC I also think about automotive
1826.32s: that's obviously a massive massive part of that equation a couple other questions I had for you
1833.84s: from a few things you touched on earlier the first one is you're talking about
1838.00s: early in the year your head is coming on and getting stopped out on some of those
1843.04s: yep I wanted to level down a little bit from where you're at in the way that you trade
1849.52s: and to put it into the perspective of a smaller newer retail trader
1855.76s: what are some ways that you think that they could apply a similar methodology where
1863.52s: based on current market circumstances hedges start to scale on by themselves essentially
1871.04s: well the way I think the simplest form is to not be exposed to the risk by getting out of the
1878.08s: rest of the very first thing I'd consider doing is looking at your portfolio and asking yourself is
1885.76s: there any way I can just set up some trend following models on the tickers that I owned and when
1895.28s: the indicators go south you just bail out of them you just sell off those positions you're never
1902.00s: going to get the top when you do that but you'll be able to hopefully avoid the 80 you know 50 to 80
1910.64s: percent down market that could happen really easily with how excited we are right now
1917.84s: the hedge idea that I use gets a little bit more one level up on the sophistication
1925.20s: because what you're doing there is you have a portfolio long so let's say you've got some names
1930.56s: you know if you Amazon or something like that you can sell that in a second I don't know how many
1935.28s: times a second Amazon trades but I'm sure there's such a liquid market you can just bail out of it
1940.96s: and go to cash if you want but let's say you're into some kind of XYZ high-tech small not so liquid
1949.76s: type company but it's done real well you want to preserve the profits you like the thing for the
1955.84s: long run and you want to hedge it well then you're going to be mostly affected by the stock market
1961.52s: itself so take the S&P or the NASDAQ might be a good choice if you were the tech stock and just
1969.04s: set up a tracking you could be a moving average you could be you know a kelton or a volunteer band
1976.80s: don't you channel any one of the above invent your own if you want a point and figure bar chart
1983.68s: would work is lots and lots of trend falling models out there and lots of parameters associated
1989.68s: with those models and what I would encourage an investor to do is to look at his own time frame
1996.64s: that he's concerned with like I tend to just be sort of a one-month time frame and a lot of my
2002.88s: indicators on the longer term stuff so 21 business days or 21 trading days is about a parameter where I
2010.64s: see uncomfortable with measuring what the markets do anything inside of a month I really don't
2018.16s: want to take a lot of actions I don't want to be long and short three times inside the month so 21
2024.64s: days to me is my parameter set for a lot of my longer term stuff and I've even gone to one step
2031.28s: further than that it's a 50 days for hedging to the downside so when that goes over though when I
2039.44s: have a 50 day parameter indicator set that says the direction now is down you have your choice do
2046.96s: you want to get out of all those stocks which it might be you know you might have 10 or 15 or 20
2053.28s: or do you want to just put on one index trade to the downside and kind of balance those two so on
2060.88s: the one side you've got your stock portfolio to the upside and the other side you you put in place
2067.76s: sort of a negative position that tries to make money this way and when so no now no matter what
2073.92s: happens at the market or your stocks it sort of just balances out so to me it's just easier for me
2080.64s: to do a calculation of my portfolio and say hey if I put on x amount of contracts of
2087.92s: stand-in-ports 500 futures I'm hedged it's like a non-event now the market goes up I make no money if
2094.72s: the market goes down I make very I don't lose a lot of money I'm just basically flat and but to
2102.32s: me it's easier to take the one transaction on and off than to try to deal with a whole portfolio of
2107.12s: like 30 sector ETFs which each have to have their own individual stop orders and you got to maintain
2114.40s: those and you got to you got to do all that I think the other key wrinkle here for the average new
2121.44s: investor that wouldn't think this through very well is if they have enjoyed a nice year in 2023
2130.16s: and let's say they had 10 issues and they nailed the bottom and they've had a great run
2135.76s: chances are one or two or three of those are a lot bigger in terms of their
2143.28s: percentage of the portfolio than they were at the beginning of the year and something I'm a
2149.92s: big believer in is trying to keep the portfolio as balanced as I can within reason and you got to give
2156.96s: the issues a little room to move and make you money you can't you can't be constantly taking off
2163.36s: profits if the the issues just barely moved so but what I mean is let's say you've got I don't know
2173.92s: say you did 20 stocks and you ended up 5% in each of 20 stocks and now your portfolio is nicely
2183.20s: ahead say 20 30% but it turns out that you no longer each have 5% anymore because three of your
2192.48s: positions are now 10% each of your portfolio you should consider and I wrote the book a you know
2200.72s: successful trader size their positions why and how because I think not many people do a good job
2207.44s: of managing their existing positions so what you could consider doing is rebalancing your entire
2214.80s: portfolio which will mean forcing yourself to take those three or four stocks that ended up
2220.72s: making a ton of money and are now throwing your portfolio out of balance you try to bring it back
2226.88s: into balance you may be stay with the issues you already have you may be peel off some of your
2232.48s: profits from the ones that are doing great things and I'm not seeing the sell at all I'm just saying to
2239.44s: get the portfolio back to balance somehow so that you don't have that exposure to the three names
2246.96s: that have done great great things and are a significant part of your money and if those three
2252.08s: things go against you now they're going to be a significant part of your drawdown that's about
2257.36s: to happen by peeling things off you're modifying the exposure so that you smooth out your track record
2264.56s: and you'll reduce that first part of that next drawdown you're going to suffer sooner or later you
2270.72s: know it might be 2026 but whenever it happens you're prepared for it and you've actually pre-positioned
2279.36s: your portfolio to be balanced which means you're going to minimize the effect of the downswing
2286.56s: and so many traders you know have a struggle the reason they're not Mr. Serenity my neck name there
2296.48s: you know if you you properly manage your positions you keep everything balanced and you think
2302.00s: ahead and you get prepared to put hedges on you get prepared to time out of positions
2307.84s: you get a market that you know turns around goes down 50% you take it and stride you no big deal you're
2313.92s: you're ready for it if you're not prepared for it it's hard to be serene about it because you're
2320.56s: watching the market shred your portfolio so that's the key to success long term and I
2327.12s: I've been through so many bar markets I've lost track at how many
2331.04s: but I think it seasons you and it gets you preparing ahead of time to deal with it so that you're
2338.16s: not caught by surprise now another thing that you mentioned during that that I want to key in on
2347.52s: was the purpose of the hedge and how you tie it to a few different factors one of which being
2355.44s: if you're in a product that's less liquid and you know the
2359.76s: market might be moving a bit as you're trying to find the door I think it's an important point
2364.48s: to linger on briefly just because I feel like a lot of retail traders they come across the idea of
2371.68s: hedging and they think well this is great now I make money in all directions you know obviously
2377.36s: this is the coolest thing ever and I think a lot of traders forget the fact that a well-deployed
2384.00s: hedge is going to serve as a drag on your returns and you accept that you accept the fact that
2390.00s: you are not going to achieve the other gains you potentially could because you were reducing
2394.96s: volatility you are carrying this hedge I call it fire insurance you really don't want to ever
2400.56s: collect on fire insurance but if you have to it sure nice to have it I don't want a stock market
2408.72s: going down 80% I don't want another depression and have to live through that I don't want even 50
2415.68s: percent down on the S&P like we did in 74 or 73 74 however those things happen the reality of
2426.00s: what we do tells me that they do happen and they occur from time to time and a hedge means you're
2434.16s: taking the risk down near zero you're not if you're making money on the hedge and you're making
2442.00s: money on the stock portfolio then you're not really hedging you're speculating something's going
2447.84s: on there you're over hedging like if you have a hundred thousand dollars worth of portfolio
2455.60s: and you put in place two hundred thousand dollars short on your hedges and you end up with a big
2460.80s: downside move and you make a bunch of money off the futures hedges and then you buy them back and
2466.16s: then you let your stocks go up again that's not hedging you're speculating because you did too much
2471.36s: of the S&P futures to hedge means to balance to take you to just out of the market and I think that
2482.08s: that's you know it's appropriate to do sometimes in some strategies depending on how you structure
2488.00s: your life and all that the problem I got with just hedging is something that has to be
2495.84s: thought about even though it's been an awfully long time since it happened nobody that's trading
2501.12s: now probably has firsthand experienced it if you have a depression like situation that where
2508.48s: you have an economic downturn that is really really severe and last for a lot more than just a
2514.88s: year or two try five six seven ten years a whole decade Japan's suffered kind of a sideways period for
2524.48s: the you know a few decades here our depression back in the 20s 30s in the US lasted a long time
2535.28s: if you have a situation like that in your just hedged you're not making any money you're not
2540.32s: losing anybody but you that would require a heck of a lot of patience so one of the reasons I like
2548.08s: to dabble in things like futures and even crypto futures and other markets that potentially could move
2556.40s: is there's potential for profitable moves in places where you know I'm on my stocks I'm hedged and
2563.76s: I'm just holding my own and if that goes on for years that's not going to be a great way to fund
2570.40s: my retirement so I'm always looking for other ways and other return streams why I'm so big in
2578.72s: all whether investing in trying to say look at look outside just the stock and barn markets there's
2584.48s: lots of other things out there that can produce profits in another thing you mentioned earlier that
2590.96s: I also want to linger on momentarily was when you were talking about the trend following
2597.44s: approach that your first quote unquote hedge is simply exiting when conditions start to change which
2604.72s: to me makes a ton of sense that's actually primarily what I do and when I think about the way that
2610.64s: I trade a lot of the times a hedge would pretty much go on if I'm levered in some capacity but I'm
2616.96s: not levered I'm probably not hedging and I'm simply going to manage the positions that I have on
2622.48s: when you're looking at a small account let's say less than $10,000 and we have somebody that's
2629.68s: you know generally new to the market here what do you think their disposition towards hedging
2636.16s: should be should they do it should they not do it I would I probably wouldn't do it I'd probably
2642.96s: with that size of account I would stick to names that I can move quickly in and out your size on your
2648.24s: positions is going to be extremely small so nobody is going to you're not going to move the market
2653.12s: to sell your positions you could easily afford to put stops in on every position you have
2658.96s: according to some kind of an indicator that measures the trend when the trend goes to the negative
2664.48s: side from the from the positive then that's the time to sell it out lock in your profits reduce your
2670.64s: potential for loss and write it out in money market funds and keep trying to put more money into
2676.88s: your account because $10,000 is hard to diversify it's hard to get your cost structures down you're
2683.84s: going to be spending more for everything with the portfolio so keep working the day job keep
2690.72s: you know pumbling money in there as fast as you can and then get your account up in size and
2696.16s: consider doing other fancy or techniques and managing risk yeah I think that that makes
2704.00s: a tremendous amount of sense and I specifically wanted to get your opinion on that because I know
2708.32s: that you right now have a system that includes hedges that come on and I think retail traders
2716.32s: don't really understand frequently enough the impact that hedges can have specifically
2721.84s: depending on what they're trading and I think a lot of them prematurely are trying to
2725.76s: send around those as compared to focusing on things like position sizing like you're talking about
2730.16s: saving getting out in time those kinds of things now one of the interesting things you brought up
2736.96s: before was the money market fund and it made me think about what did you think about the movement
2743.04s: between equities and bonds I thought that was fascinating for a time because a lot of people would
2750.08s: use bonds as their risk off asset and then all of a sudden their risk off assets also crashing
2755.12s: you're like well what the hell's going on here what did you think about that and why do you
2759.52s: would you think it was a real being being an old gray hair guy is that I think people don't do a
2768.48s: good job of going back in history and analyzing some of the things that have gone on we've had about
2774.80s: a 40 year until about a couple years ago and interest rates were down around zero for short term
2781.76s: money and money markets were paying nothing we've had about a four decade or so bold market in bonds
2790.64s: because interest rates did nothing from 1980 in Reaganomics when the short term interest rates got
2797.36s: up into the high teens it's turned around and spent the entire four decades coming down and that's
2803.36s: going to fuel a bond market rally so the 60 40 crowd started working out you know that magic formula
2810.40s: to supposedly smooth out performance and you know it's supposed to be you know good for your long
2819.68s: term financial plan and you can buy in whole bonds you know 40 percent and 60 percent in stocks
2824.88s: everything is fine the problem with that mentality is that when interest rates get to zero could they
2832.56s: go up from there yeah could they go down from there kind of hard you're kind of bumping up against a
2839.76s: lot of a lot of problems when you start getting into negative interest rates so all of a sudden
2849.44s: a couple years ago when interest rates started climbing the bond market got shallot so all of a
2854.56s: sudden the 60 40 crowd takes a hit on their socks takes a hit on their bonds and there's no place to hide
2862.96s: and so so much for that risk mitigation it's not risk mitigation if it doesn't really reduce risk
2871.68s: and you're not taking you're passively sitting by and saying I'm diversified between bonds and stocks
2878.32s: but you're not actively attacking the risk of bonds or stocks you're just accepting whatever
2885.84s: risk they have and hoping diversification reduces your risk but if both go down at the same
2892.32s: time you have no place to hide in the stocks the thing that's happening with stocks a lot it may
2900.64s: have fueled a lot of this rally that we see right now is where else are you going to put your money
2907.84s: young kids kept by real estate anymore it's they can't even afford it they can hardly afford their rent
2915.60s: the interest rates being where they are it's hard to afford the mortgage
2919.84s: even if you've got some money now you got to you got to make these payments on the mortgage
2924.96s: you've got I mean stocks are the largest liquid market in stocks in the US particularly actually
2937.92s: where you could funnel billions and billions of dollars and have a shot at least
2947.12s: of equaling or bettering inflation rates right now if you look at like commercial real estate
2956.24s: I'm not so sure that'd be a great bet I'm not sure that bonds I mean if interest rates
2964.96s: at all continue to maintain a little bit a higher level or go up from here bonds are nowhere
2972.56s: going to keep up and within flashy stocks could futures could real estate prices right now if you
2982.96s: have a soft economy real estate may have had its run and it's going to rest for a while I don't know
2991.20s: where else you can go try gold and silver you know there's times when that moves there's a lot
2996.24s: of times when it doesn't it could be the potential but if you take the silver concept then why
3001.84s: just limit yourself to silver why not look at coffee why not look at you know crude oil other
3008.80s: different markets out there that you can potentially make money and so I think commodities and
3014.72s: stocks are the only game in town left the lately where you can pile in large sums of money
3020.48s: and that's might be why a lot of people put money in the stock market at the field of rally
3026.00s: late in the year here and whether that can continue to go on will be another
3030.96s: whole question. Well you bring up a funny point I didn't think it was too incidental that when
3039.44s: the Fed was talking about pausing and they softened their tone quite a bit we saw a lot of volume
3047.60s: coming out of Microsoft and flowing into bonds and I think that that really highlights your exact
3053.76s: point that a lot of people for a long time were looking at this and saying well I'm not going to
3058.56s: put it in bonds that's not doing anything so I might as well just put it in big test specifically
3064.32s: like Microsoft. Yeah and hope for the best you basically hoping for the best and it's like you
3071.28s: know what else to do with it and you can't just leave it sitting there in a money market fund or
3076.40s: something so I mean you're losing to inflation doing that lately so yeah might as well take a shot
3084.24s: got nothing to lose that's kind of the attitude a lot of people have.
3088.80s: Speaking of taking a shot for the last couple questions I want to pivot us now to 2024 in the way
3096.00s: that you know you're thinking about the year ahead obviously neither you or I are kind of the
3102.08s: predictive type I don't really try to do that myself because I always think it's more of an ego
3106.96s: exercise than anything else but I'm really curious how you are positioning for the start of the year
3114.56s: you already talked about the way that you feel were kind of at a top-e level here and markets are
3121.28s: getting maybe a little bit jittery but what are you thinking about 2024 are there any major themes
3127.04s: that you're curious and seeing how it plays out? Pretty much the same themes I always do I'm always
3134.08s: looking to try to play the upside of the exchange-traded fund markets I've got 30 out of 30 long
3142.80s: stops behind every one of them moving them up every day as I can I've got the hedge ready to go
3149.52s: and it's a lot closer than it used to be the indicators are keep trying to move it up every day so
3156.16s: this hedge trade that I took off and allowed the sectors to run has turned out it to be a very
3164.16s: profitable buy signal obviously and but the sooner later there'll be a sell signal and I'll put the
3171.20s: hedges back on right now I'm just trying to keep moving the stops up every day on that hedge so that
3176.56s: I can get it on as soon as I can justify so that'll be another theme I think the other thing that
3183.76s: I wonder whether it wouldn't be something to consider in my portfolio I'm seeing a lot of this and
3189.76s: things strange things like aluminum and I don't know some of the softs and so on when you get
3198.64s: economic disruptions and you get some things like inflation or you get supply or demand
3205.92s: interruptions by things like the red sea be shutting down to shipping and you're you're logistically
3212.40s: disrupting commodity flows around the world and energy flows around the world you can create
3218.32s: situations where futures and commodity prices will move so I'm hopeful I've added a 10th strategy
3226.08s: just in the last week in my IRA that's going to be a short-term future strategy it's going to be
3233.28s: based on three-day indicators so it's going to do a lot more trades but I'm trying to build the
3239.44s: automation I'm going to try to support that with automation so that I don't have to do too much work
3245.52s: and it's going to trade about 21 markets I think I figured out and what I'm hoping happens is
3253.28s: that if we get and that's a big F I don't know if the stock market's going to keep rolling or not
3258.80s: but if it turns over and it heads to the downside then my I would say my sector ETF programs are
3267.92s: going to be sitting in cash a lot and I'll be hedged on the part that is still long and generally
3275.44s: speaking in a down market that strategy is going to be swimming upstream have a tough time
3282.08s: but I'm hopeful that some of the some of the economic disruption could affect things like energy
3289.44s: markets and say the bond market maybe and stuff like that and I can exploit that to try to produce
3295.92s: profits there to offset the struggling over in the sector timing so that's kind of my theme early
3303.60s: on here is to kind of be very alert and prepared to go the other way if this thing runs its course
3310.08s: and decides the turn and if it doesn't to enjoy the ride to the upside that's pretty much the
3316.96s: outgoing. One other question I had for you is this year when we saw some of the weakness in the
3323.52s: broad market like the S&P 500 something like the queues and tech just kept plugging away
3330.08s: and when I see how heavily anticipated the integration of AI is and I am a believer that it's the
3338.08s: kind of thing that is a massive unlock for tons of things but it's obviously very early and we
3345.52s: still don't really know how it's going to be integrated and regulated. But I'm curious if you think
3351.04s: going into 2024 if you start to see some of that weakness that you're thinking of would that
3358.00s: lead you then to essentially rotate over short equities writ large or do you still hold bastions
3365.04s: that might still be performing well like tech that could be fueled by AI.
3369.52s: On my Nasdaq trading I would just go short that's I go longer short all the time so
3375.52s: if it goes over to the downside and I run that on a 90 indicator it'll go short pretty quickly and
3385.12s: if the thing falls apart and gets really ugly I will just coin money with that strategy.
3392.64s: In cryptos if the Nasdaq type companies the tech companies start going to the downside it seems
3401.04s: over time cryptos and tech have been related to each other except recently so it's been interesting
3408.24s: there's been some different things happening in the crypto world that I think have broken it apart
3415.20s: from the straight whatever the techs are doing but we'll see maybe it goes back to doing the same
3421.92s: thing as techs and goes down to if it goes down I'll short crypto futures. I'll big deal there either
3430.32s: hedges beyond I'd reduce my exposure in the long ETFs so that now is getting more and more money
3440.16s: market funds and then on the rest of it I just try to be looking for disruption in energy markets
3447.28s: or disruption in the cocoa markets or the coffee markets or whatever so he beans corn whatever
3454.08s: there's lots of opportunities out there you just got to look for them and get your indicator
3459.04s: set up and peel off a portion of your money to that particular strategy so that's kind of the way
3464.00s: I think I try to protect myself and try to look for profit opportunity because ideally speaking I'd
3470.24s: like to make money every month trading never done that for a very very long period of time there's
3478.24s: always drawdowns that I've had to live through and I've lived through a lot of them but the I think the
3486.32s: goal is to try to keep squeezing those drawdowns down in both magnitude and in length of drawdown
3493.76s: length of time in the drawdown and I'm closer to it today than I was 20 30 years ago for sure
3501.12s: so I think I've done some things in the right direction and I think that allows me to approach a
3507.20s: year like 2024 and realize that hey things could get really we could have more of the same and
3513.52s: break open the champagne or this thing could fall apart right after the New Year's Eve celebrations
3520.40s: are over and they're cleaning up and all of a sudden we're off to the races to the downside who knows
3526.24s: and like like you said earlier you don't predict you just react and the key is to be prepared to
3532.80s: react if you're if you're sitting there saying I'm loving this upmarket and you decide to just leave
3539.92s: your portfolio in place and go take a two-week vacation to the Bahamas or something and enjoy
3546.72s: some of your the rewards that you've made on your portfolio and you leave your portfolio exposed
3553.76s: and it decides to go the other way it could happen so quickly by the time you get back you might
3559.12s: have a lot smaller portfolio you just got to you got to put the things in place and you got a
3565.92s: rottom and you got to be prepared to pull the trigger you can't hesitate when the when the target is
3574.00s: in your sights pull the trigger that resonates pretty well one last question for you
3582.16s: does an election year factor in differently when you're thinking about the year because that is
3588.08s: one thing I consider quite a bit especially the way that we're positioning how the economy is doing
3593.36s: and how inflation is doing I don't like being too tin-hatty thinking you know that there's a lot
3598.64s: of subversion going on but I do think of it as there's probably a bit of window dressing happening
3603.60s: right now how do you think about an election year in an election year you know to me it's all about
3612.00s: say news items and world events and all that and an election year carries with it by the very nature
3619.52s: of it some news events that could potentially affect markets especially if the markets were
3627.60s: extremely overextended to the upside and looking for an excuse to sell off all that would require
3633.84s: you know something like an anti economic growth candidate coming up in the polls or something
3644.72s: or winning the election or something like that and everybody panics it just becomes a catalyst
3650.08s: for movement it may not really when you think about it and figure it all out really mean that much
3657.36s: to the economy but it becomes the trigger it becomes just the catalyst for movement and once the
3663.92s: movement starts the trend takes over panic or euphoria sets in and the markets are good at
3670.32s: perpetuating those things the Wall Street journals of the world the daily what do you call it the
3679.52s: investors daily business daily every day yeah all of those types of publications including all the
3688.16s: the CNBCs the Fox business all those they're all going to be catering to whatever direction the
3694.40s: market's going if everybody is depressed and the market makes new lows every day then you're going
3700.40s: to hear a lot of stories about how rough things are and the economy is still looking bad and the feds
3706.72s: trying to prop it up and doing this but so far it isn't working and you're going to have very negative
3712.48s: attitudes and the trend down tends to perpetuate itself but the same is true to the upside if the
3720.00s: market's making new highs then it's a bunch of smiley faces and giggling and everybody's happy and
3727.04s: they're you know every stock they're going over the stocks that gaped open five and 10% that morning
3733.04s: and it's a different type of mood that you're watching and I think what that those publications are
3739.28s: just feeding the viewership what they want to hear and so that's how trends tend to perpetuate
3746.40s: themselves and I think election years tend to provide some catalyst for movement so yeah you never
3755.44s: know could easily there's you know there's all sorts the conspiracy that the fed tries to keep
3764.16s: interest rates low during election I don't know I that just might be the timing of the economy
3771.20s: I don't know if they can actually more accurately do that and pull it off I think you can obviously
3782.48s: they kept the interest rates too low too long I think during COVID and after COVID and now I'm
3789.20s: worried that they're going to do the opposite they're going to keep it interest rates a little too high
3793.84s: for too long and we're going to end up slipping into some sort of a maybe a medium to hard
3800.72s: landing and if we get a bad economy going and we're at war at the same time that could get I don't
3807.60s: know kind of ugly I think out there in the world so I I hate to be a pessimist but I like to be prepared
3815.28s: things the best way to behave as a trader and obviously you've been at it for a while so it's
3820.24s: been working for you being being prepared but um I'm stoked to have connected with you I love
3827.28s: kind of distilling down some of the information that you have in drawing on your experiences one
3832.56s: of the most beautiful things of doing this so thank you so much for taking some time to hang out
3836.64s: with us I have links to your Twitter page or x-page whatever is supposed to call it now your website
3843.60s: both of those will be in the show notes below but is there anywhere else that you want people to
3847.44s: get a hold of you app? No also be Twitter is probably the most frequently found place I'd say
3857.20s: I'm most active there because I've got 52,000 plus followers and so unavoidably I get a lot of
3864.96s: comments and a lot of if I post something I'm going to get like I just wished everybody a happy new
3870.96s: year I think I got like a hundred people commenting or reacting to it so that's probably where the
3878.40s: action is Facebook a lot less than Facebook is starting to kind of perturb me a little bit with
3884.72s: all the imposter's we have a known imposter that is actually contacting people on crypto scams
3892.80s: Facebook doesn't seem to be able to get rid of the guy and it's just really kind of pissing me off
3902.80s: LinkedIn is pretty solid but is a little bit more business oriented I'd say so I do have
3908.88s: followers there I've got probably a thousand or two thousand people there but certainly isn't the
3912.88s: size of Twitter so that's a easy way and in Twitter I am at bosso b-a-s-s-o underscore T-o-m-tum
3924.16s: no other spelling is allowed it would be imposter and be careful out there I don't sell you
3932.48s: anything on direct messaging so if somebody's trying to sell you something it's an army
3938.24s: well beautiful yeah I'll make sure I get the right links in there so everybody can find you but
3943.92s: yeah Tom absolute pleasure hanging out thanks for chatting with us well I don't have a great
3949.20s: 2024 and hopefully a great happy new year's Eve thank you sir I'm sure we'll catch up soon all right
