0.72s: what's up everybody eric here i got a
2.56s: video on why i trade iwm and how i've
6.40s: made over a million bucks in it so i get
9.76s: asked fairly frequently by folks who
12.32s: follow the channel they know i talk
13.60s: about iwm a lot and they're curious
15.20s: about why so this video is going to do a
17.84s: couple things i'm going to walk through
19.28s: why i trade iwm after discussing what it
22.08s: is but more importantly i want to
24.40s: compare it to something like the spy and
27.28s: also the rut which are the most common
30.24s: you know comparisons that people bring
31.76s: up why do i trade iwm over those
34.24s: so first let's start with a quick
36.56s: overview of what iwm is so it's the
39.52s: russell 2000 index so it tracks
43.44s: 000 plus
44.88s: small cap stocks across all different
47.60s: sectors which we'll get into in just a
49.12s: minute but
50.80s: the beauty of it being an index etf
53.92s: is it gives you a lot of flexibility and
57.04s: inherent diversification without having
59.28s: to pay like a mutual fund that sort of
61.76s: thing
62.64s: so let's take a quick look at a
65.36s: comparison so as you can see
67.52s: i have a few metrics that i want to look
70.96s: at when we're comparing iwm to the spy
74.08s: and to the rut
75.60s: so we're going to talk about if it's
76.96s: liquid
77.92s: if there's a dividend if there's
79.76s: diversification and quantify that how
82.40s: efficient the products are and then the
84.48s: underlying so first let's start with spy
88.56s: which is the s p 500 index etf
92.80s: is it liquid absolutely and we can
95.84s: assess that pretty simply so if we pull
98.48s: up something like spy
101.28s: and we take a look at a few key metrics
103.60s: the first one is the volume over you
106.00s: know 100
107.52s: million shares traded in a day so plenty
110.72s: of movement you could see that the bid
112.40s: ask spreads are very tight and this is
114.96s: tight because it's after hours so during
117.60s: the market when it's open it's normally
119.28s: a penny or two
120.88s: we see a ton of option expirations this
124.24s: is also a pretty good indicator of
126.24s: liquidity because if there's no demand
129.20s: for the options they won't offer
131.36s: weeklies they won't offer things like
133.28s: quarterlys the market needs enough
135.52s: people interested in those options in
137.84s: order to make it worthwhile to provide
139.92s: them so the fact that this has so many
142.40s: expirations inherently can start to give
144.40s: you some ideas but most importantly if
146.64s: you pop them open
148.00s: you can see it's a 400 product and again
151.20s: after hours on a 39 delta put it's 4
154.32s: cents wide very very liquid so
157.36s: absolutely meets that threshold the next
159.60s: one is dividend does it pay a dividend
162.08s: yes so as of right now it pays
165.64s: 1.64 dollars a share
168.40s: the reason why i'm doing the gross
170.72s: dollar amount
172.08s: as compared to the percent as a percent
174.80s: because we're comparing it
176.56s: to iwm so i think it's important um to
180.56s: also see the gross dollar amount because
182.64s: really the primary strategy that i'm
184.88s: using when i'm trading iwm is the
187.04s: covered strangle so if you need a recap
190.56s: of what the coverage strangle is or why
192.32s: i trade that you could find a video to
195.36s: that up here but that part of that is
198.24s: holding an underlying potentially so i
200.48s: like things that pay a dividend
202.56s: the next one is diversification this one
205.12s: gets a single check for that
207.52s: and i'll explain why it gains exposure
210.80s: to over 500 large cap stocks it's a
213.60s: great product for that exact reason
215.92s: especially
217.28s: for buy and hold if i was setting up a
219.04s: buy and hold portfolio it would be
220.64s: mostly spy
222.00s: now there are some drawbacks that go
224.16s: with that which i'll get into in just a
225.44s: minute
226.64s: efficiency
228.16s: this is a really important one
229.68s: especially if we're actively trading so
231.36s: what i did again
233.04s: using the coverage strangle as my
234.96s: benchmark because that's the strategy
237.04s: i'm deploying in these i took a look at
239.52s: a 42
241.52s: days to expiration
243.28s: short put at a 30 delta
245.84s: and i looked at the percent return to
248.88s: cash secure the position so essentially
252.16s: that came out to 2.04
254.88s: in
255.60s: in spy which actually really good right
257.36s: now it's because the market's volatile
259.12s: plenty of times this is way under a
260.72s: percent so this is kind of a fun time to
262.48s: do this comparison
264.08s: so again all i did was go out 42 days i
267.28s: took a look at the 30 delta put and i
270.40s: said okay that's giving me you know
273.16s: 8.45 cents 46 cents or whatever and
276.80s: um
277.92s: it's essentially putting up 413 dollars
281.92s: per share so
284.24s: it gives me an idea of the percent
285.84s: return for the overall trade so in this
287.68s: instance again you're gonna collect 840
289.76s: something thousand dollars and you have
292.08s: to tie up 41 300 to cash secure the
295.52s: position
297.84s: and then the last part of the question
300.24s: is
301.04s: underlying what is the underlying
302.32s: product so again in this case it is an
304.64s: index etf so it means that it does
307.12s: indeed
308.24s: have shares that trade which again is
311.36s: really the main comparison we're about
314.00s: to get into which is with the rut
317.84s: so the rut is
319.36s: very liquid because it's a big brother
321.20s: index as compared to the spy so that's
323.12s: the only reason why it has an additional
324.72s: check mark there has no dividend because
327.28s: there is no underlying product it's a
329.92s: cash secured index
332.32s: this is the primary reason why i don't
335.76s: trade the rut for my coverage strangle
338.32s: strategy because part of the covered
339.76s: struggle strategy is taking in stock or
343.04s: taking in a security of some sort and
345.52s: being assigned you can't be a sign on
347.52s: this it's cash settled
349.28s: so diversification i think that the
351.84s: russell is more diversified than the spy
354.48s: which i'll explain in just a minute once
356.08s: we get over to iwm
357.84s: efficiency this one gets three check
359.84s: marks and it's simply because um it's
362.40s: the big brother version of iwm
365.20s: and then underlying like i said no
367.60s: underlying now a notable mention here
370.40s: though
371.52s: is
372.24s: it does enjoy section 1256 tax benefits
376.16s: so it essentially mixes your short-term
379.20s: capital gains tax and you actually get a
382.16s: portion of your profits taxed at a
384.80s: long-term capital gains rate so
387.12s: when i'm not trading the covered
389.60s: strangle this is typically my go-to if
391.92s: i'm trading naked short puts naked short
394.24s: calls naked short ratio strangles for
396.48s: that exact reason for it's definitely
398.96s: more efficient you don't have to put on
400.32s: as many contracts and it does have a
402.56s: great tax benefit all right so
404.96s: let's take a look at
406.84s: iwm so
408.72s: as we can see it also has a bunch of
411.60s: weekly expirations not the same number
414.40s: as the spy though so i would argue that
417.12s: the spy is slightly more liquid than iwm
421.44s: you can also see it not slightly
423.52s: actually fairly so because you can also
425.44s: see it in the volume traded
428.56s: now the reason why i didn't bother
430.96s: giving spy an additional check mark
432.88s: although you could argue that it
434.24s: deserves one is from a
437.12s: like pragmatic deployment perspective it
440.00s: really doesn't make a difference they're
441.36s: both
442.56s: extremely liquid products so i don't
445.12s: think that there's truly a discernible
447.36s: outcome if you trade one versus the
449.36s: other via liquidity alone
451.36s: now dividend it also has a dividend that
454.16s: it pays except the russell dividend is
458.28s: 0.67 cents
460.40s: so again it matters just in the context
463.52s: of once you're assigned
465.68s: how much are you potentially going to
467.92s: get
469.04s: when the dividend does come around
471.20s: now let's talk about why i trade iwm
475.20s: over the spy here's where it really
477.28s: comes in the first one is
478.96s: diversification and this is a really
481.28s: important concept to understand
483.44s: so i just pulled up kind of some details
486.48s: for both this side over here is iwm this
488.88s: site over here is spy
490.48s: there's a few really important notes the
493.36s: very first one
494.72s: is the top 10 holdings of the spy which
498.24s: you see here make up about 25
501.36s: of the index
502.72s: and you can also see that reflected here
507.04s: this is the s p 500 index notice how
511.20s: it's broken up
512.64s: we see a large portion in information
515.52s: technology
516.72s: and communication services the rest of
519.12s: these boxes have i would argue kind of
521.28s: slightly better profiles but the size of
524.16s: the box indicates how much of the index
527.04s: it composes
528.72s: so in this instance the top 10 holdings
532.00s: are massive if you look at microsoft
534.24s: apple
535.20s: google facebook
537.12s: nvidia amazon tesla they make up a huge
540.88s: portion of the index
543.04s: the other thing
544.96s: is exactly what i was just highlighting
547.44s: is the actual centralization of
552.00s: let's highlight that there the
553.44s: centralization of the index a quarter
556.88s: over a quarter 26
559.44s: of
560.32s: the spy is information technology
563.76s: now that's benefited the spy pretty
565.92s: heavily especially over the past decade
568.16s: where technology has been doing great
571.12s: but it's also a reason why spy was in
573.84s: the hurt locker for a while especially
576.16s: earlier this year when technology was
577.68s: actually lagging quite a bit
579.60s: so as soon as we start to see some
581.28s: secular capitulation away from
583.68s: information technology being just a pure
586.32s: leader
587.36s: the spy will start to slow its
589.60s: performance
591.04s: now let's contrast that to iwm
593.84s: the top 10 holdings in iwm as you can
596.80s: see here make up about 4
599.52s: of iwm huge difference so again just for
602.96s: a line by line comparison apple is seven
606.08s: percent of the spy that and that's the
608.80s: top holding in in the spy the top
611.12s: holding in iwm is an energy company but
614.56s: it's
615.24s: 0.38
617.04s: so what you'll notice is the variance
619.20s: between these is very low the highest is
621.20s: 0.38 and the lowest is 0.28 for the top
624.96s: 10 holdings whereas for the spy it's
626.88s: 7.12 and 1.19
630.16s: huge variance
631.60s: so by trading something like iwm you
634.48s: start to limit
636.72s: your
637.72s: unsystematic risk significantly
641.36s: now the other thing is if you take a
643.52s: look at its um centralization of sectors
646.96s: you see 39 or
649.20s: cyclical 24 defensive
652.72s: 37
654.16s: is sensitive now across those we still
657.36s: have pretty heavy weights in technology
660.64s: industrials health care financial
663.28s: services consumer cyclical i don't want
665.92s: to keep dorking that word up
667.68s: but
668.56s: you kind of see the point here whereas
670.64s: in
671.76s: the spy
673.12s: you don't have anywhere near the same
675.52s: level of diversification in products
679.04s: so if we do a heat map comparison of the
682.32s: russell notice the difference
685.76s: huge huge change from the s p 500 which
689.44s: has
690.40s: 500 plus
692.88s: quite a few big boxes to the russell
695.36s: which is over 2 000 and there's two
698.40s: things to note here the first one is
700.72s: there's not really many huge boxes you
703.12s: could argue
704.56s: that the semiconductor on semiconductor
707.12s: is you know a bit of a standout
709.36s: maybe you could argue
711.76s: lows as well but other than that and
714.32s: that's not the lows that you're thinking
715.76s: of by the way just to be clear
717.52s: um
719.04s: but other than that
721.52s: that's really it
723.04s: the other thing to note is notice the
725.12s: size of the sectors healthcare is about
728.56s: the same size as industrials which is
730.48s: about the same size as information
732.24s: technology which is about the same size
734.32s: as consumer discretionary you kind of
736.32s: get the point here there is just far
739.28s: better inherent diversification in the
741.60s: product in my opinion
743.52s: now let's also talk about efficiency
745.68s: quickly we just talked about the return
747.76s: that you would get in the spy now
749.44s: looking at iwm for the same exact style
751.76s: trade 42 days to expiration 30 delta put
754.72s: you get two and a half percent on your
757.44s: money
758.48s: again
759.52s: this is another leading reason
762.00s: especially in lower volatility
764.16s: environments where this discrepancy
767.04s: starts to be pretty damn meaningful in a
769.92s: position size you're getting half a
772.32s: percent more essentially return on your
774.40s: money in iwm over the spy and then they
777.68s: both have underlying stock again which
779.92s: is why
780.96s: i trade iwm for the coverage strangle
783.20s: and trade iwm very frequently in my core
786.00s: holdings over the rut it's literally
788.72s: because of that because if the rut had
791.84s: shares to trade that paid a dividend
793.68s: that's where i would be especially with
795.44s: that tax benefit but it doesn't so i
798.00s: don't
798.96s: this is why i trade iwm so much and this
802.40s: is why it's one of the largest
805.44s: contributors to my core
807.92s: returns in my portfolio because it
811.28s: really makes a huge difference
814.48s: these small little details when it's
816.72s: deployed over a long period of time
819.12s: so as always any questions or anything
821.52s: let me know hit me up you can find my
823.28s: contact info in the video description
824.88s: below
825.84s: and until next time be an outlier
