0.00s: What's up, allies? Time for a market update. Today we'll go over the market as a whole
4.28s: pretty quick. Then we'll take a look at Broadcom, a couple other stocks. And at the end, I
7.94s: want to answer a question that somebody hit me up on Twitter or X or whatever the platform
13.08s: is known as. We'll go with X because I want to support Daddy Elon. And it was about
18.44s: some deep in the money puts in GameStop. And I think the conversation in GameStop is
25.48s: useful for non-GameStop traders to talk about those put. So we'll get to those towards
31.24s: the end. Now, from a broad market perspective, definitely tech led the dance today.
37.96s: She was hit a high of 539. Spy still trending sideways. And I do believe internal to spy.
46.04s: We're seeing a not insignificant amount of rotation. So what I mean by that is we can
51.94s: see energy is really opening up to the downside. I was actually shorting this specifically
57.66s: from the break up perspective from the downside. This has been unrelenting. Financials are
62.64s: still starting on this downside trend. We can see the different term moving averages.
67.82s: 1020 are actually starting to roll over, which is not good. Industrials rolling over, which
73.50s: is not great. So we can see across the board, other than discretionary, which continues
79.94s: to just do literally whatever it wants. We can see health care down utilities down real
86.78s: estate down. That means if we have a decent amount of sectors within the S&P 500 rolling
95.98s: over, even though the S&P 500 can be holding on. And the reason for that is because it's
100.30s: propped up by a smaller number of names in comm services, which is doing well along with
105.14s: a couple of other pickers that happen to be doing well at the point. But if we look
108.54s: across the overall breadth, it's not good. We lost another five percent. Oh, you guys
113.58s: can see this top line up here. There's a little ticker bar that you can add now. There's
117.58s: a couple things that I use up there like advanced decline, advanced decline spread for the
122.10s: New York Stock Exchange for the S&P 500. And then one of the things I track up there is
127.98s: the percentage of stocks within the S&P 500 that are above a 50 day moving average. And
132.14s: right now, that's down like another five points to 43%. So that's continuing to roll over.
139.14s: These are all early warning signals. This is why when people get caught to the downside.
144.42s: And again, I'm not forecasting or expecting some sort of big downside move. My job is to
148.82s: understand what's happening right now is best as I possibly can. And this is the comical
154.18s: part when people get caught to the downside. And I was like, well, that came out of nowhere.
157.22s: How did it happen? This is how it starts. Now that doesn't mean that we're going down.
161.54s: Could level off and then start accumulating to the upside. Again, you have to trade what's
165.30s: happening right now, but right now there are warning signs that underlying conditions are
170.70s: changing and you should be aware of that. That doesn't mean you have to take everything off
174.34s: and not put on a trade and wait for the down tick because it might never come off and it doesn't.
180.18s: But it also can. So that's why we have to pay attention to this stuff.
185.18s: And then the equal weighted S&P 500 was down a little bit today. So that was down a little
190.62s: over a quarter point. So again, that's showing you the divergence between the S&P 500 being
195.50s: propped up by a smaller number of names against the S&P 500 equal weighted, which is looking at
200.78s: it as a whole. Very interesting overall market movements today. Now from a general news perspective,
208.62s: there was a couple things. I wasn't paying super, super close attention today. There's a couple
214.14s: things in here that stuck out to me. And then for those that don't know, actually, I recently
217.82s: did a video for bar chart about some options trading tips. If you've not seen it, I encourage
223.90s: you to check it out and leave a comment to show up and show out for the outliers, show some love
228.54s: over there. It's like five tips for options trading. Just general stuff. A lot of you will know
233.58s: most of it, but I actually think there might be a couple things in there that might be net new news.
239.26s: So there's a ton of conversation going on around the AI theme, which makes sense. I totally
247.18s: understand that. And this is interesting. I didn't know this actually. Canada's finance minister
252.46s: resigns as unpopular Trudeau faces biggest test of his political career. I've been seeing a lot of
257.10s: clips of Trudeau getting, I don't want to call it slammed. That's a little dramatic, but definitely
263.02s: not seemingly to be in a in a great position during the the points that he's making and the
268.14s: counterpoints being made. But fun fact, I'm going to go visit the Canadians out there. If any of
271.82s: your Canadian, I'm coming to your place soon. We're going to go to Calgary so that we can go to
277.02s: and then go up to like Jasper. Just go do that whole Rocky Mountain range thing there.
282.78s: But we'll go see what's up. Maybe we'll run into the finance prime minister.
287.82s: Let's see this next one. You used to require passenger vehicles to sound alarms. If rear passengers
291.66s: don't fasten your seat belts, that's terribly annoying. This is all just kind of speculative stuff.
299.02s: I don't think we have to dive too far into that. Let's take a look at the just a couple of
303.34s: their broad market metrics that I like to look at, which are advanced decliners, more declining.
308.70s: Again, today 58% 49%. We still are seeing decliners expand, which we don't necessarily want to see.
321.34s: Yeah, so these are also growing a little bit. That's also not great. Stocks around their moving
327.18s: averages. Let's take a look at the sectors themselves. IT definitely uptick on percentage above a
334.38s: five day, five days. So this is good. This is stabilization. Normally, what we want to see
340.30s: is the relationship and how these are trending. Take a look at materials, for example,
344.70s: 32% are above a 200 day, then 36% are above the 150. Let's just pretend that this trend continued
352.62s: going. That means that something is generally in some sort of recovery or ascent across the
357.74s: indexes as a whole, but or the sector as a whole. But that's not really so much the case for any of
362.22s: these. Most of this stuff is actually rolling over. Even IT, you can see it's 51%. That's half of
370.38s: the sector is below short term moving averages, which is again, tending to be stuff rolling over.
376.46s: And then comm services was the main leader here, but take a look at this. 50% of them were above
382.62s: their 20 day, but 32 are above the five. So literally, all of that summarizes into it does look
390.86s: like there's a bit of underlying rotation going on. And it's something that I like to keep an eye on.
398.14s: Now, let's take a look. We'll take a look at GameStop in one second. I want to take a look at AVGEO
402.22s: first really quick is take a look at this parabolic move. It had earnings on the 12th after the
407.90s: market. And it had a massive gap up on the 13th and another gap up here. This is a big stock.
418.70s: This is a really big stock to have this kind of move. It had a really solid earnings. It was
425.42s: expected at a $1.13 came into $1.42 big gap up. This is the kind of thing that we try to pay
432.46s: attention to for post earnings announcement drift. So for the way that I typically would trade that
438.14s: on this gap, this becomes bottom end stop, which is might be something that's on right now to try
444.78s: to follow along with this thing. And then the stop gets moved up to here because there's no reason,
451.66s: especially on these really big parabolic moves a lot of times they will roll right back over.
456.38s: And that doesn't mean that they're coming all the way back down, but it typically shows an
460.86s: opportunity to take profits, re-enter in a consolidation. But this also could pull Tesla on us.
467.34s: And Tesla just said see you later nerds and it's not come back. Well, I guess it did come back a
471.58s: little bit in here. But since here see you later nerds not come back. Okay. So let's take a look on
478.62s: X. There was somebody that tagged me on this. Who was it? Give props for Joseph, GME, Copa Kai.
489.34s: Drop that and then I'll let you know that I'm doing a video. I'll throw the video below this.
494.14s: So what this is showing is this person saying being seeing a lot of volume on the 125,
499.74s: 16, Jan 26th put strike, but today some unusual movement in the 125, the 25s.
506.30s: And so the question then back ends like why are there these pretty big trades going on on these
513.02s: really deep in the money put. So let's talk about it. Now there's a few things that we can glean
519.50s: from options. The first thing that we have to keep in mind is pretty simple. And that's there are
526.46s: a lot of parties doing a lot of different things. So if we go out here to the 16 Jan 26th, if we go to
534.78s: the 125s, we can see that there's 4300 puts here. And that's a lot of them, especially if you look
540.86s: at the comparable OIs for across the chain and whatnot that might beg the question, what's why are
546.06s: people doing this way out here? And let's talk about this trade first before we go to the 2025
551.74s: example. One of the things that will actively happen is what we call delta trading. And that's when
559.10s: we try, it's what I do for my ratio call diagonals, ratio put diagonals. We go further out in time
565.90s: and we go really deep in the money. You go further out in time because you pay overall more theta,
573.18s: but you have way less per day theta to K. So if we take a look at this, these are losing about
579.50s: two cents a day in theta. And then if we go to something like these 67s, you'll, and we take a
585.18s: look at the theta, these are losing three, four, five, these are losing way more theta. So that's
592.06s: one of the reasons why we might go that far on time. We want to decrease our theta, but we want to
595.98s: play delta because this essentially will have a delta of one. Don't pay attention to this delta.
599.90s: It's all skewed because of the volatility in the underlying. You can kind of follow the theme here,
604.38s: right? So 27 delta, 31, 33, 35, 37, 38, goes all the way up to 42 before it breaks. And here is one
611.02s: it would keep going up from 42. So this isn't actually lower delta's here than this. That's just
615.50s: skewed from volatility. So these essentially would be a delta of one, not perfectly one because
622.22s: these still have plenty of extrinsic value on them, but pretty close to a delta of one. So that's
627.34s: the first thing playing delta. The second thing is standard arbitrage opportunities. So a lot of
635.10s: times you'll notice that if you go deeper and deeper in the money, what do you notice about the
638.78s: bid-ask spread? If we take a look at these 29 puts, the bid-ask spread is 50 cents. If we take a
643.82s: look at these 50s, the bid-ask spread is almost two dollars. If we go even deeper, this bid-ask spread
650.86s: is over three dollars. So or I'm sorry, over two dollars. So what's going on here? There's a liquidity
658.78s: gap. So there will also be different entities, high frequency traders, algos that are looking for
665.90s: pricing discrepancies based on where they can get a fill. And they're speculating. This isn't
671.34s: necessarily a directional speculation, but more on arbitraging out a mispricing of an option.
677.18s: And that doesn't surprise me because this is a really, really small overall series of trades.
682.14s: The volume today in these 125s and 2025 at the 125 is 104. The net change alive was seven over
691.18s: prior, meaning seven were added today. So it's 144 total. So this could be some sort of entity
697.58s: that is finding mispricings in these options, which is very common, especially notice how weird
702.46s: the delta's get. They're all over the place. They're all out of whack because volatility's out of
706.86s: whack. The volatility on these right now is out of five 90s. So when things are at streams like this,
711.66s: they become more prone for those kind of price discovery moves. Now, the final thing that this could
719.66s: be is part of a much bigger portfolio or bigger trade theme. Just because there's one individual strike
728.54s: that's being transacted in one individual expiration doesn't inherently mean that that's the only
735.74s: thing that that person is looking at. So if we take a look at the size of the trades for these puts,
741.66s: which are right here, we can see this. I would wager. This is the same entity getting in at a
746.30s: couple different points in time. I'm just guessing. I don't know, but that's what it seems like to me.
750.94s: And the first trade went out for 620k. The second one went out for 381k. So these are not small.
756.70s: This is not going to be a standard retail trader. This is probably going to be part of a much bigger
763.10s: book that's being traded. And it could be hedging activity because of some short game stop position
771.10s: that they're trying to take risk off. Coming out not this far in time for that hedge would be
776.22s: very sus to me. It wouldn't make a lot of sense beyond the fact that you're not paying a lot of
780.46s: extrinsic value. This is essentially all intrinsic value. So that could be the case. Or it could be
786.62s: something that just compliments a broader portfolio rarely do options traders. Look at each individual
794.62s: options trade trade and kind of analyze it in a vacuum. We don't really care about that. We
800.54s: care about it in context. But what I really care about is if I have options in this stock, this stock,
807.18s: this stock, this stock, this stock, what is my overall net delta across everything? What is my
812.94s: overall gamma? What's my overall theta? What's my vulga? Like I care about those things because
818.94s: all of those options are going to move in different ways. And you have to pay attention to the
822.06s: total risk that you have out in how. So lift notes version. I'm no fucking idea who this is
827.90s: or what it is. There's nothing in this that's like shocking to me. This is pretty common for
832.38s: these really deep in the money options. There's going to be trades that come through like this.
836.14s: You can see that there is 268 that were added on the 105. So it's like that doesn't totally
843.66s: surprise me to see these changing the way that they are. But it is always fun to talk about how
851.58s: markets behave and why these kinds of things can be going on. So those are a few reasons. It could be
856.38s: somebody speculating. It could be somebody hedging. It could be high-frogacy trading. That's
860.54s: taking advantage of mispricings. It could be part of a bigger trade, some sort of pairs trade between
865.34s: these. Lots of lots of different things. So markets are dynamic. Lots of reasons for people to do what
872.22s: they want. As always, hit me up with what you're looking at, what you want me to take a look at. I
876.22s: love talking about the stuff that's interesting to you guys. Be an outlier. I'll see you later.
