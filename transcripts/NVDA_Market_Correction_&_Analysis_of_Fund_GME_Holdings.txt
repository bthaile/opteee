0.68s: first off my bad outliers I realized
2.76s: that the video I did yesterday was like
4.28s: 20 minutes long when I start talking
6.48s: about the markets I kind of can do that
8.92s: so my goal for today is to keep this a
11.92s: little more palatable for people and I
14.48s: have two things I want to cover
15.84s: obviously the tech leading selloff will
18.68s: be the first thing and then the second
19.88s: thing is we have some really really
22.00s: interesting new data that's come out in
24.80s: GameStop specifically with this and I
27.40s: want to talk about some of the homework
28.92s: that I started doing about this specific
31.52s: fund that supposedly holds uh just
34.72s: tremendous number of shares in this case
36.84s: actually technically speaking it's more
38.24s: than the entire float and then some so
40.64s: there's some very specific things we can
42.68s: learn about that and we'll get to that
45.96s: towards the end of the video so let's
47.48s: start with the broad Market though
49.28s: because there's important activity going
51.76s: on and this is again exactly what I've
54.44s: been talking about where I don't know
56.84s: which way the market is going to go but
59.00s: for leading into this week and
61.40s: throughout last week it just felt like
63.88s: we were in a bit of a rotational period
68.16s: where didn't have a sense where things
69.68s: were going to go but it felt like we
71.16s: were going to break one way or the other
73.68s: and one of the things that you've heard
75.56s: me note a few times as we take a look at
78.12s: the broad markets is that Tech does not
80.40s: look good and I've said that multiple
82.60s: times so and I also in the context of
86.20s: wanting to unwind my teach Q's position
88.40s: which I finally got out of today
90.84s: so this is looking across the S&P 500
94.72s: we're looking across all of the
97.16s: individual sectors and take a look we
101.20s: see xlc Communications going down hard
105.28s: we see xlk technology going down hard
110.16s: there's a couple others that are falling
113.20s: moderately so xli would kind of be the
115.36s: next closest in the pack as well as xlb
118.64s: but guess what the same tickers I've
122.48s: been talking to you about are showing
125.16s: strength still hitting highs xlp hit a
129.04s: new high xlre hit a new high xlu hit a
132.92s: new high XLV hit a new high XLF hit a
137.00s: new high so this is the entire idea
142.76s: behind a sector rotation strategy it's
145.80s: why I have exposure in real estate it's
149.44s: why have exposure in xlp products
152.08s: individual tickers not xlp itself it's
155.08s: why I have exposure right now in XLF and
158.12s: I also have exposure in
160.68s: XLE which is not uh you know not really
165.20s: playing ball as much you know there's
166.52s: got to be one in the group that's not
168.28s: doing what I wanted to do but really
170.88s: this is more of a a individual strength
173.24s: play Within the sector even though XLE
175.00s: is not doing great it's the the NM trade
177.24s: that I was reviewing earlier which is
178.76s: doing still well
180.60s: and realistically even NM which is kind
183.40s: of funny because if we take a look at it
185.16s: NM is more related to Gold but it
187.92s: actually has a really high correlation
190.16s: to energy so I will use this to kind of
193.20s: play both at the same time the gold
196.28s: commodity in and of itself but then also
198.16s: the energy sector because especially in
200.20s: short-term correlations this will tie
202.48s: very very closely to energy so it's
204.44s: little bit of a a duplicative play so
206.92s: when I'm talking about it tying to
208.56s: energy it's not a direct play on energy
210.80s: it's actually more of a direct play on
212.52s: materials but it does carry over
215.20s: massively into energy like right now
217.40s: energy was down today and so was um NM
220.72s: but materials also didn't fly off the
222.56s: shelf today so kind of a little bit of
224.40s: both I suppose now looking across the
227.28s: market I continue to see the same thing
229.20s: I always do opportunity there are things
231.28s: we can trade to the upside there are
232.52s: things we can trade to the downside
233.76s: there are things we can trade sideways
235.44s: xly has been trading sideways so you can
237.92s: look in there for individual products
239.44s: that are just sideways trending same
241.48s: thing for XLE tons of things in there
243.36s: rotating sideways some things in there
245.04s: showing strength still so I always try
247.92s: to remind people that whenever the
250.08s: market starts throwing some of these
252.24s: curve balls that we might feel some type
254.48s: of way about right Nvidia is down almost
257.12s: 10% today 9 and a half% that's literally
259.72s: a correction almost in a single day
262.36s: that's not an insignificant move
264.40s: especially on a gap down especially
266.28s: following three preceding down days
270.24s: this I'm not even going to lie this
272.12s: looks uglier than I was expecting I
274.52s: really am a bit surprised because after
277.68s: the earnings I understood this move I
279.84s: understood this move these two to me
282.40s: looked like most people were getting
284.28s: shaken out of the position and then you
286.64s: know the people that wanted to be in
287.92s: were going to be in and then today
289.24s: there's just this big continuation so
292.32s: one of the things to highlight here is
293.68s: that the the markets they do have
296.16s: momentum in drift and that's kind of
298.44s: what you're seeing here people late
300.12s: comers to the party people that were
302.20s: figuring out what they wanted to do with
303.44s: their portfolios and then submitting
305.20s: orders it's just really interesting to
307.36s: me to see this starting to to pair down
309.64s: so far now really critical point here
312.68s: for me if this does not start to base
317.64s: before we start getting down to kind of
320.08s: this level in here I don't like that and
323.84s: I don't like that specifically because
326.24s: even though we're starting to rotate
328.20s: down if this begins basing here and
331.28s: creating a higher low I'm still okay
334.52s: with it we're still in an uptrend it's a
337.32s: little it's obviously a correction from
338.84s: here at this point but it's not
341.96s: egregious this is still
344.48s: completely okay what's not going to be
347.48s: okay is if this starts rotating down
350.12s: into this value area and again that
353.00s: doesn't mean immediately that we're
354.60s: falling out of bed but that starts to in
357.60s: my opinion really really call into
359.40s: question the strength of this trend and
361.96s: all Trends reverse at some point at
364.12s: least temporarily so we have this little
366.88s: bit of a a double top almost but we're
368.96s: starting lower highs right so there's
371.20s: our high lower high lower high we have
374.76s: higher low then we come to lower lows
378.00s: lower lows so if this comes down to
380.96s: another lower low that is in my
384.32s: opinion clear clear sign that we're
387.12s: starting to rotate over on this trend so
390.96s: for me and I I mean I have no direct
394.00s: exposure to Nvidia I don't care to I'm
395.96s: typically trading things like tle Q's or
398.32s: Nasdaq futures which both of those
400.28s: obviously have a ton of exposure to
401.80s: Nvidia inherently leveraged from the
403.80s: jump but I'm seeing a lot of people
405.60s: getting really antsy to start buying
407.44s: into Nvidia and I don't blame you
408.76s: especially if you like the company Long
410.36s: Term but as per usual I always think
413.88s: wait for strength there's no reason to
415.96s: buy it here at 108 if it's going to drop
418.88s: down to 9 1 we don't know where it's
420.96s: going to drop but the way that I
422.60s: typically handle these is I'll literally
424.76s: just set an alert on both sides so I'll
427.04s: be like okay if we get a break below
429.84s: here that tells me we're continuing to
432.12s: the downside if I get a break above here
435.04s: to the high of this candle then I start
437.84s: liking it more to the upside and I can
439.44s: play it that way if I'm so inclined and
441.20s: still get it at a relative discount
442.88s: within that range so it all depends on
445.36s: your trading style your trading time
446.80s: frames but the one thing I try to remind
448.80s: people is if when you buy things at a
450.48s: discount they're typically at a discount
451.88s: for a reason Nvidia is a really
453.92s: interesting case here because I still
455.56s: think it's an incredibly strong
457.32s: performing stock but it is rotating down
461.04s: like it's objectively the case if you
463.16s: had bought up here or up here you are
465.52s: currently down money and again if you're
467.16s: a long-term investor literally nobody
469.44s: cares that's totally fine and when I say
471.04s: nobody cares it means this little down
472.40s: move that's inconsequential if you're
474.72s: going to hold this for years and I mean
477.12s: if I had to bet I absolutely would bet
479.24s: in video will be worth more in a year or
481.08s: two years than it is today but that's an
484.76s: investors's perspective where there's a
486.72s: giant opportunity cost for that Capital
488.84s: being parked there that for me as a
491.52s: Trader I'm uninterested in I want to
493.64s: trade things as they're doing things
495.48s: that I can tie along with so for this
499.40s: little bit different approach and again
501.16s: you can see what I would do is just see
502.88s: okay which way do you want to break down
504.12s: or up and then depending on that if I
506.00s: want to get some sort of thematic
507.56s: reversal position to the upside cuz
509.16s: that's what I would expect to see at
510.48s: some point it just depends on where does
512.80s: the market decide that the floor starts
514.84s: to get priced in and we don't know yet
517.28s: so Nvidia very interesting case and very
520.56s: clearly just driving the tech sector
523.40s: down and then when we look across the
525.40s: indices there's still excessive weakness
528.36s: in iwm down over 3% today Q's Tech heavy
533.20s: down over 3% today so these two really
535.84s: dragging and the S&P 500 was only down
538.76s: 2% so the S&P 500 continues to be
541.92s: propped up by all these other sectors
543.92s: now the question is how long do they
545.84s: hang on so for me in the way that I
547.88s: trade also I realize that the video is
549.44s: already 9 minutes long I'm doing the
550.68s: same thing I did yesterday sorry but
553.88s: when I look at the S&P 500 it does look
558.20s: like it's maintaining at least some
559.84s: residual strength but the question is
561.36s: for how long and for me with stuff like
563.80s: this what I try to do now is keep a
566.24s: really sharp eye on everything that's
568.84s: propping up the S&P 500 right now which
571.04s: again are those same sectors that I was
573.24s: highlighting before and if those start
575.36s: showing weakness or rotating over and
577.80s: this continues to be the case then I
579.84s: mean that's essentially alignment to the
582.08s: downside very difficult to slow down
584.44s: until people decide that there is value
587.00s: at that point and they want to buy back
588.36s: in so that is what I am keeping a very
591.84s: close eye on now let's pivot over to
593.40s: GameStop because we did see some kind of
595.52s: interesting news today from a trading
597.72s: perspective we had a little bit of a gap
599.48s: up which was nice to see that was kind
601.36s: of shunted pretty quickly still
603.60s: continues this uptrend so I'm digging
606.76s: that no no issues with it and I don't I
611.76s: think I still have my calls on I haven't
613.40s: looked actually in a little bit to see
614.92s: what they're doing but they're going to
616.36s: be coming up on soon that I have to do
617.96s: something with them it's the uh short
619.88s: calls oh yeah and for those that are
621.36s: wondering about the conversation before
623.68s: about numont and XLE you can see in
626.24s: these shorter term time frames it
627.92s: correlates pretty heavily so 3 days 99%
630.40s: correlation 5 days 85% and then 10 days
634.08s: 77% so sometimes when I'm trying to
636.32s: trade the kind of both of those ideas in
639.56s: one ticker numont is one that I will
642.92s: take a look at again it's not like a
644.40s: Pure Energy play so that's not what we
647.28s: were coming here to look at though we
648.24s: were coming to look at GameStop so if we
650.60s: take a look at the open interest we have
653.56s: 560,000 calls against 269 on the put
657.04s: side so not quite 2:1 or maybe actually
660.56s: right about 2: one but it's still
663.64s: scattered all over the place when I see
665.76s: what expirations are hot it's actually
667.68s: not the six seep I'm seeing 13 seps
670.44s: starting to catch up a little bit here
671.92s: but you'll notice like I'm seeing a lot
673.24s: of green which is 18 o I'm seeing a lot
676.28s: of 20p which is this kind of salmon
679.72s: color then we have these gray boxes
682.56s: which are further out in time 17 GN 25
685.00s: so we're just kind of all over the place
686.92s: which just means that we don't have a
688.40s: clear ch that we're leaning on right now
691.36s: when I look at volatility this looks
693.28s: completely normal now short-term Vol
696.04s: 133% 140% for earnings VA right because
699.84s: we know earnings right now is still
701.64s: scheduled for the 10th after the market
705.48s: so this is the interesting news that
707.28s: came out today though this popped up I
709.16s: think on super stunk and then a couple
711.56s: folks in the Discord brought it in there
714.08s: just because it's an interesting
715.32s: observation and we see that we have this
717.96s: entity that essentially has a what 4
723.24s: billion shares which 4.7 billion which
727.04s: you know if you're I'm not good at math
729.08s: but there's not that many shares so then
731.88s: what does this tell me it tells me more
733.92s: likely than not one there could be some
736.92s: sort of reporting error that can be the
739.00s: case now what I also would imagine to be
742.80s: the case here is this could just be use
745.36s: of derivatives so when I took a closer
748.72s: look at the fund itself this is the non-
751.88s: lending variation which this one is the
753.84s: lending variation just showing you that
755.92s: there's a difference between these funds
757.88s: so there is a non- lending variant of
760.64s: this that's not what this one is this
762.72s: one that corresponds with this clearly
764.48s: says lending so we can find the lending
767.72s: variation here and we can see this the
771.04s: fund may make limited use of Futures
773.64s: Andor options for the purpose of
775.20s: maintaining Equity exposure this fund
777.08s: May participate in Securities Lending
782.32s: lot of questions I don't have answers
784.56s: yet so this is something I'm actually
786.00s: going to chat with Newton about a little
788.24s: bit because he might have a better sense
790.28s: on this particular topic than I do I
793.28s: don't know if this is part of this kind
796.52s: of uh creation Redemption cycle I also
800.40s: don't know the way that these run
803.28s: because it's flagged as an index fund
806.64s: which is fascinating because if you go
808.44s: to their we site and we want to take a
811.36s: look at their funds they have Equity
814.12s: Funds and then if we break down these
816.76s: Equity Funds management style there's
819.08s: actively managed
820.56s: funds and then there's index style funds
824.48s: the whole point of index style funds is
827.12s: they're supposed to represent an
830.48s: index so it's very very curious to me
834.40s: that we see this kind of structure I I I
838.04s: don't fully understand what it is or why
840.52s: it is the way it is the other thing that
843.80s: I can't find is just a ticker for this
845.64s: if any of you all know what the ticker
847.08s: symbol is for this product I I would
849.80s: love to hear it I literally don't know
851.28s: what the ticker is for this because as I
853.48s: go through their funds I don't see
855.76s: anything labeled this right so if I
858.12s: literally copy this directly the
860.28s: terminology perfectly I uncheck any
863.56s: filters right so that we're seeing
865.24s: everything that they have I drop that in
867.12s: nothing returns so then I was like okay
869.36s: well maybe somehow it's in something
871.88s: else maybe it's in this or the multi-
874.88s: asset so check out maybe the cash fund
878.04s: and see if there's anything in here
879.76s: obviously not this is looking at um
882.44s: typical security so then let's go to
884.76s: multi-asset and see if there's anything
887.48s: like this in
891.36s: here
893.40s: which again this is I I just don't see
896.56s: it because this is talking about
900.04s: completely like a completely different
902.32s: set of products right this is global
903.96s: tactical asset allocation so this is
906.32s: using stuff from all over the
909.20s: place
910.52s: [Music]
911.80s: so yeah I'm confused I don't know where
915.56s: this is on their
917.28s: website so if anybody maybe all funds I
920.56s: didn't check in here
925.56s: yet see I like I don't get it maybe if I
929.04s: get rid of some of the extra tail on the
934.24s: words nothing like as I'm going
937.60s: through none of those are popping up so
940.48s: I don't know where this is I'm actually
942.44s: like like kind of I'm kind of confused
946.08s: so CU I went to the website directly
948.48s: from here and I was trying to find the
951.92s: specific details for this again for this
954.92s: specific product so that I could try to
956.84s: look more closely because the other
958.72s: thing is again like if this is 1.56% of
963.24s: the fund and this is Uber Technologies
966.60s: and we can figure out how much the fund
968.64s: is 4.38 billion so if we take handy
973.08s: dandy calculator we go 438 billion got
975.56s: to turn it sideways so we can get enough
977.88s: uh zeros that is million there's billion
980.84s: 4.38
982.40s: billion and then we just multiply that
985.00s: by 1.56 time 1.56
989.68s: oops
990.88s: by 0156 my badtimes
996.92s: 0156 so it gives us 68 million 68.3
1001.64s: million why do I care about this because
1003.72s: I can figure
1004.92s: out at least
1008.04s: about what what this
1010.64s: is right because if this is telling me
1014.84s: that in this fund there's again 68 B
1018.92s: million dollar of uber well then how
1022.40s: does this other stuff fit into their
1024.56s: fund because this is telling me that
1026.28s: they control
1028.00s: $4.7 billion of GameStop which again
1031.88s: even if you're using derivatives the
1033.40s: notional exposure matters which I mean
1037.00s: let's just do the math it's going to be
1039.48s: significantly more than that so if we do
1042.52s: um 4.7 billion shares I'm just going to
1046.12s: round it so 4.7 billion
1049.68s: times current market price 23 to $
1055.04s: 108
1057.16s: billion notional value so just something
1060.96s: weird is happening here and again I
1063.00s: don't know what it is so this is
1066.48s: something I intend to look more deeply
1068.76s: into to try to sort this out and again
1072.24s: this is why for the people that are kind
1074.04s: of like Eric why do you spend time
1075.52s: looking at GameStop it is because of
1078.12s:  like this it's because this doesn't
1080.68s: make sense I am not quite as far as like
1084.48s: the full tin foil apes and I'm not
1086.88s: jumping to the idea of like it's all
1089.16s:  it's immediate manipulation
1091.52s: although there's a solid part of me that
1093.52s: looks at this and says it kind of looks
1096.16s: like manipulation of some sort I don't
1098.12s: know so then the objective part of my
1101.24s: analysis wants to try to find an
1103.80s: objective analys an objective output
1106.04s: that I can prove right because I have my
1109.68s: instincts which says this looks weird
1112.20s: but just because my instincts say that I
1114.24s: don't take those to the bank and just
1115.68s: say yeah it's all rigged very well could
1118.08s: be but I'm going to try and analyze it
1120.64s: to see if I can find an answer which
1122.36s: right now I don't have one I don't know
1123.64s: what this is but I know just in terms of
1126.08s: the notional size it doesn't make sense
1127.72s: relative to GameStop which leads me to
1129.84s: believe based on again this perspectus
1132.20s: that I cannot find this freaking fund on
1134.56s: their website but it tells me that they
1137.72s: do use Futures and options and that they
1139.96s: might participate in Securities lending
1142.88s: it's just weird man it's just weird so
1146.20s: yeah just like I said at the beginning
1147.84s: of the video I'm sorry cuz here we are
1149.72s: at 20 minutes again but these are just
1151.68s: two really interesting topics to me
1153.48s: right now that I want to understand more
1155.24s: deeply this one's going to take me some
1156.72s: time because everything I look at with
1159.68s: this it's there's no clear simple
1161.36s: answers I actually just set up a call
1163.76s: well I reached out to one of my friends
1165.84s: who's a market maker because I'm
1167.88s: literally going to ask about this cuz
1169.08s: I'm I'm just curious how this kind of
1171.80s: thing structures itself specifically
1173.88s: with respect to the fund and he runs
1176.08s: some different funds as well for um
1178.20s: white labeled uh clients and so I I have
1181.56s: a bunch of questions not just about this
1183.56s: but also just about the creation
1185.36s: Redemption cycle as far as he sees it
1187.04s: from a market making perspective so this
1189.40s: will be just another thing I'm adding to
1191.32s: the list last time I spoke with him we
1193.28s: we literally spoke for like 3 and a half
1194.64s: hours so it'll probably be a long
1196.36s: conversation but hopefully I can learn a
1198.76s: little bit more because again this is
1200.20s: why I'm fascinated with GameStop is
1202.60s: every time I look at it there's some
1204.00s:  that's completely anomalous to me
1205.84s: that I don't understand and I want to
1207.24s: learn and I'm learning a ton even with
1210.12s: something like this it's a blast so as
1212.84s: always anything I should take a look at
1214.44s: let me know be an outlier I will see you
1216.52s: all later
