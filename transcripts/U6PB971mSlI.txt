0.00s: I started trading options back in 2007 while I was in high school and it's the primary way that I built my original layer of wealth.
7.44s: The goal of this video is to walk you through how I trade options.
11.44s: The idea is to kind of pull together all these different concepts into one place to give you some ideas because what I do doesn't really matter to you,
19.52s: but hopefully you can gain some different ideas and inspirations from some of the things that I do and maybe bake it into your process,
25.36s: have better results going forward.
26.80s: So you'll notice on the left hand side, we have some guiding concepts called what I pursue right hand side gets a little deeper into my actual approach.
34.96s: Let's start on the left hand side with the guiding concepts process driven. What does this mean? Well, when I first started trading, the vast majority of what I did really had me focusing on the outcome of a single trade.
47.76s: That sounds kind of important, doesn't it? Why wouldn't I emphasize the outcome of a single trade?
52.80s: Well, it's because I noticed that there was a propensity for me to start doing a lot of things that disagreed with my plan, trying to salvage the individual trade.
62.32s: And then I started noticing that I would deviate from the plan way more frequently, trying to salvage other trades.
67.92s: Then I noticed that essentially I wasn't doing anything related to the plan and I had nothing to lean on to figure out what I was doing wrong because I was just doing whatever I wanted.
78.16s: So the idea behind process driven is that my goal is to create something that's repeatable for the long run.
85.68s: One of the biggest mistakes I made as an early trader and I imagine seeing with a lot of other people is I had the idea that I was going to turn my $5,000 account, $3,000 account, $15,000 account into my future wealth.
98.08s: Reality is that's not going to happen for the vast majority of people.
102.16s: It's going to take a lot of saving more money, making more money by achieving better jobs while you're saving more.
110.24s: And in third lever you can pull is getting better at trading.
114.48s: So in this scenario, by focusing on the individual trade outcomes, I'm sitting here trying to put the cart in front of the horse thinking,
121.76s: well, if I can just get a bunch of money really fast on these trades, I'll be set.
124.64s: And it's a really naive perspective. It doesn't bear out.
127.76s: So the main thing I remind myself is that everything I do feeds a process that I should be able to execute.
134.64s: Not over the next week, month, year, five years, 10 years, literally over several decades is the idea.
141.20s: And that leads to what you see down here. Number five is robustness.
145.68s: What I do needs to make sense, not just today, not just in the current market environment,
151.28s: but how can I create an approach that allows me to stay up to date with what the market's doing?
156.80s: Because for example, if we take a look at a chart and we go back, let's check out SPX.
161.36s: And then let's go back like five years.
163.04s: You'll notice that SPX over the last five years has done different things.
166.48s: It had this really steep decline during COVID and stimulus checks came out,
170.56s: started skyrocketing back up, came back down, went sideways for a little bit,
174.08s: and then started grinding back up.
175.52s: So if you develop an approach that does well here and only here, it lacks robustness.
181.68s: It means that you don't have this skill set to trade this kind of environment,
185.68s: or this kind of environment, or maybe a slower drift up.
189.68s: And the idea is to be able to trade all of those conditions.
193.44s: Because over your trading career, you'll see many different conditions.
197.52s: So process driven, we want to be focusing on how am I building something that stands the test
203.92s: of time that I can continually optimize over time, worrying less about the individual trades,
209.44s: worrying more how each individual trade fits into a broader system,
213.60s: accepting the fact that that's going to include losing positions, and that's entirely okay.
217.36s: The second point here is strong convictions loosely held.
221.12s: So when I first started trading, I would kind of go after whatever I heard sounded good at the time.
226.96s: And again, highly naive approach.
229.44s: Because when you're first starting out, you don't have the depth of experience to kind of
234.32s: intuition your way through what may or may not make sense.
237.84s: So then you just kind of start doing it for a little bit, and then abandon it when it's not
242.00s: working periodically. You don't really have anything to show for it.
244.88s: So the idea behind strong convictions loosely held is like Bayesian analysis.
248.88s: What I want to do is do a bunch of research on something, quantify how strong something is,
254.40s: and then as I get new information injected, update on my analysis.
259.20s: So great example is actually this past year in rut, the Russell.
263.36s: And this past year, if I pull this out year to date, when the year started,
267.76s: I was positioned long Russell.
269.60s: And the reason for that is because we were coming out of this really high rate environment,
274.56s: and the market was starting to forecast cuts as early as March.
278.72s: I knew that that was going to be front-rand by the market.
281.20s: I didn't want to miss the opportunity there.
283.52s: So I'm positioning myself long, I wait a month, and not much is happening.
288.24s: Right? So if we look here at the end of January, compared to the beginning, we just did not do much.
293.36s: And I was like, hmm, okay, this is taking a little bit longer rate environments changing.
297.20s: It's getting pushed out. Maybe I need to give it a little bit longer.
299.84s: Instead of March, now it's looking like kind of middle year.
302.40s: Okay, fine. I wait another month.
304.40s: So the end of January takes us to the end of February.
306.72s: I start to see some movement, but if you look at this in context, it's not much.
311.04s: The market opened over here at like 2010, and towards the end of February,
316.96s: it hit like less than 2100, so it just didn't move that much.
321.28s: So I started repositioning my portfolio, because even though I believed that when the rate environment
328.08s: was going to change, that we would see small caps move, that's what I believe, that was the thesis.
333.20s: It wasn't happening.
334.08s: So the strong conviction was in that thesis, loosely held, was as soon as it wasn't doing what I thought
340.08s: it should do in a reasonable amount of time, it was time to do something else.
343.20s: And that's when I rotate into things like the NASDAQ, which was actually starting to move
349.04s: really strong. It doesn't look like it because it looks flatter here, but that's because of the
352.80s: magnitude of the moves. It started the year at like 16604, and then by March-ish, it was at 18350.
360.16s: So it already had made fair move in the same time frame, and realistically what I was
365.28s: starting to pivot into was T-Tropocuse. And that's because it's essentially slightly magnified
370.80s: version of this showing a lot of strength. So that's the idea behind Bayesian analysis, is I want
377.36s: to formulate a really well thought out perspective that's based on data that I can objectively
382.64s: analyze, but then I want to be sensitive to new information. Hard and soft quantifiable edge.
387.04s: What this means is I want to have different modalities to make money, and you'll see that over here
392.24s: a little bit more in detail when we get to this section. But to give you an example of hard edge versus
397.04s: soft edge, very simple. If we take a look at something like the Russell, when it started making
403.36s: this breakout move, I traded this breakout, and then I followed it up. This was based on momentum
409.68s: that brought our thesis, but all of that boils down to stuff that I was able to quantify research
415.60s: around, but it's still very discretionary. I had the same thesis here, and it didn't work, right?
420.08s: So here it did. It's a discretionary trade, because I'm front running a move, hopefully with the
425.76s: rest of the market. But this is something that takes a ton of different experiences together in
430.32s: my mind as I'm creating this idea, it's discretionary in nature. Meanwhile, for an idea of a hard edge,
435.76s: if we take a look at Apple, and we take a look at its earnings, we look through Apple's earnings out
440.88s: of the past eight earnings here, six of them, the implied volatility was higher than the realized
447.68s: or historical volatility here, here, here, here, here, here, and here. What am I showing you? This is a
454.64s: long-standing market function where implied volatility leading into earnings tends to be overstated
461.92s: compared to realized volatility. This is not unique to Apple, this is across earnings in general,
466.40s: this is a known phenomenon. That is a hard edge. It's something everybody knows exists, and it's
473.28s: there anyways, for a bunch of different reasons that I'm not going to get into in this video, but
477.76s: it's not really discretionary. I'm essentially just running an analysis based on a persistent trend
483.28s: and trying to trade that. So a completely different profit mechanism baked in here. Combined analysis
488.40s: simply means I'm going to use all data points that are relevant to what I'm doing. So I'm not a
493.68s: fundamental analyst, I'm not a technical analyst, I'm a whatever analyst. My main job is to make
499.36s: sure that what I'm doing aligns with what analysis I require. So for example, going back to the rut.
506.96s: In this position, I had the thesis I had that was baked on a lot of fundamental concepts,
513.04s: high inflation, depression of small caps due to that, those kinds of things. There's a lot of
517.52s: fundamental components to that. From a technical perspective, I'm using that to lock in my timing.
522.24s: So even though I still had the thesis here, from a technical perspective, it was not lining up. So
526.64s: then I need to do something else. But that combines both fundamental and technical analysis into a
532.08s: cohesive picture. I'm essentially going to wait the fundamental and technical analysis differently
537.84s: based on what I'm trading. Rebusiness, we already hit. 1% growth sustained is simple. The devil
544.00s: is in the details and it can take you really far in trading. And I give you this example down here.
548.96s: This is looking at a hypothetical scenario over 30 years where we start with $25,000 and we save
556.24s: $1.5,000 per month. At 15% return versus 16% return, 1% variance at the end of that leads to a
564.72s: $2.2 million variance. I care about the difference between 15 and 16% because I care about $2.2 million
573.76s: over that time frame. The tricky part is if you look at this for the first 16 years, it's not
579.04s: much of a difference. You can't really see what's going on here, but that's the nature of compounding
583.76s: returns. They take time to display themselves. But then notice once you get over here towards
589.04s: year 30, look at the gap between these as it's opening up. This just becomes parabolic from there.
594.48s: I care about that 1%, that 1% difference is a lot of fucking money. I care about that. So should
602.00s: you. The last thing here is skeptical optimism. In the finance world, you notice that there's no
607.68s: shortage of complete and utter bullshit. But I still remain open to information just about all of it.
613.36s: There is a heavy screening process that data goes through as I'm receiving it. I think it's done
619.28s: me really well, remaining very open to new data, but being highly skeptical in how I analyze it,
626.24s: see how quantifiable it is, see how rigorous the origin of the thesis is. Those details matter a lot,
632.96s: but you don't want to get too close-minded in my opinion because markets change. And as soon as
637.12s: you get to the point where you don't want to change anything, you're going to start falling behind.
640.56s: All right, let's talk about the approach. I take a very top-down approach. I start with the
643.92s: economy. Then I'll look at the market, the indices, sectors, subsectors. I want to understand
649.12s: from a broad picture how things are moving. Why? What are the primary themes? So right now,
654.64s: the primary themes are still high inflation. It's getting fairly persistent. The economy is still
659.92s: fairly strong, but slowing in some instances. And we're seeing things like AI still being very
665.20s: interesting, although it's now just starting to wane a little bit in this next earning cycle.
669.44s: So there's a lot of interesting things that you can kind of devise just from that. So,
674.00s: based on these two inputs, I'm going to come up with a disposition. How do I feel about things?
678.24s: What do I think makes sense for the portfolio that I want to construct based on this information?
682.72s: Then I'm going to build a portfolio around it and make sure that each individual position in
687.28s: the portfolio supports this disposition collectively. So even though, for example, let's say that I'm
693.92s: bullish in tech. Does that mean that everything I have in the portfolio is bullish tech? No,
699.12s: because there's other things at play. And I want to make sure I integrate that into what I'm doing.
703.68s: This is really important for options traders. Number two, this idea that profit mechanisms come
708.88s: first, then we fit a strategy. All this means is I'm not going to look at the market and say,
714.32s: hey, where can I put on a vertical spread? Where can I put on a ratio diagonal? I don't really
719.60s: care so much about what structure or strategy I'm using. What I care about is what opportunity am I
725.44s: trying to capture? And then what strategy fits it the best. So the cliff notes version of this is
731.44s: if I want to trade something bullish, the profit mechanism is bullish, something going up in value.
736.72s: That's what matters. Then if I choose to buy a call, sell a put, that's just an expression of
742.16s: what fits the portfolio best. They both make money in the same scenario. How much they may
746.24s: come, which risk they have, that's the difference. You have to focus on the profit mechanism first.
751.04s: The structure and the strategy just give us ideas on how to capture it. So how to derivatives
756.08s: specifically options fit into my life. Well, I use both long and short premium strategies,
761.20s: not wedded to either or I actually think they both have a use case. So I don't limit myself to
766.56s: being in theta ganger or somebody that's just trying to buy yolo options. I do everything. I
771.60s: generally use undefined risk structures. So I'm not spreading things off with verticals more
777.04s: often than not. And I simply manage the risk of the positions. So rather than putting on a vertical
781.76s: spread and then just letting it go, I might sell a put or buy a call. And then if it's not doing what
786.56s: I want, I'll manage the trade in the middle as compared to just letting it go. What I'm trying to
790.40s: do here is reduce the friction of what I'm putting on. When I'm trading directionally with options,
795.84s: I'm looking for leverage. The other reason why I like options is because it gives me exposure to
800.72s: specific things like volatility that you can't really isolate as well with inequity itself. I use
806.48s: all different timeframes. Everything from zero days out to 180 is kind of the majority of what I do.
812.48s: I have stuff that goes out past a year. It's a little bit of everything and it depends a lot on what
817.04s: the market is doing. Again, I'm agnostic to time frame. What I care most about is the profit mechanism
821.92s: first and foremost. And then the timeframes I'm using are just designed to help me capture the profit
826.72s: mechanism. So I don't go into this thinking, oh, I only want to trade, you know, 90 day options.
831.52s: I don't really care. I don't really care if it's 90 day options. What I care about is how do I best
836.08s: capture this profit mechanism? Next thing is for directional trades. I have a bullish tendency
841.44s: in me and it's because markets quantitatively display bullish drift. So I don't look to stand in
847.20s: front of that unless there's a really good reason. So I typically am looking for trend, momentum,
852.96s: drift style directional plays. I like breakouts, break downs like I showed you in that rep position.
858.40s: And then these are the strategies that I use for bullish and bearish directional trades. I have
862.96s: videos about all of these. I have an entire playlist. I'll link in the notes below that goes through
866.56s: all of them. As you could tell, the stable ain't that deep. I focus on simple strategies that I can
873.92s: execute really well. It's the same thing we use in the Marine Corps brilliance at the basics.
879.44s: That's really what I look to convey with what I'm doing in the markets. I'm not looking for the 62
884.56s: leg dragon leaping frog spread. I want the simplest expression of structures that allow me to capture
889.92s: the profit mechanism. Not as sexy as the dragon fire breathing leaping frog spread, but gets the
895.76s: job done. Looking at volatility, this is a really important aspect for option traders. And the
900.32s: reason being is because it provides a completely different style of return than equities products
905.52s: typically. So with volatility, I'm looking to trade things like variance risk premium, which I
910.48s: have a video on that. I'll link to it below. Mean reversion for volatility extremes, either upside
915.20s: or downside because volatility is mean reverting and then relative value and skew between different
921.60s: options chains between different strikes. You can find things that have a little excessive or not
927.12s: enough wall compared to what it historically might. And these are the strategies that I use to
932.40s: capture most of those. I would add single options, both long calls and puts short calls, short
939.12s: puts to these for really for the more relative value or calendars stuff like that. But this is the
944.56s: heart and soul of what I do here. And now for analysis, I have videos that go through how I apply
949.68s: analysis to markets in general. But as I already told you, it's combined. I'm going to use technical
953.76s: fundamental analysis. I'm going to use everything I can find and successfully quantify. The main
958.88s: things I'm looking for are price and volume. That leads everything. So all of the different indicators
965.36s: that I have on the chart are designed to help me visualize price and volume because that's what
971.76s: matters. So these are just moving averages, standard deviation channels, volume profile on stuff that
978.00s: has an underlying that trade. So if you grab Apple, you'll see the volume profile over here, volume
982.96s: down here, average volume over certain durations, those kinds of things. The idea is to do my best to
989.52s: analyze what the market is doing and figure out how to interface with it, not to dictate onto the
994.64s: market what I think it should do because what I think it should do literally doesn't matter at all.
999.12s: My job is to work with the market. So that's how I think about trading options. If you have any
1003.28s: questions, let me know, be an outlier. See you guys later.
