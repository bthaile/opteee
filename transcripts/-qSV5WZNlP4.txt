0.00s: you
30.00s: you
60.00s: you
66.00s: you
75.00s: what's up outliers
77.00s: we are in very interesting time still
81.00s: awesome to be back what a perfect time to be back the best time to be back if there ever was nobody
87.00s: It would be kind of on your own
92.00s: with who thinks you will be back
99.00s: the package or bring back with you
102.00s: we have doing it differently from
104.00s: so fully back in terms of my understanding of things,
108.00s: I'm getting deeper, but it takes a little time
111.12s: just to be saturated.
112.76s: And that's kind of how it goes.
114.64s: They started monitoring the markets
116.52s: much more closely last week.
118.88s: And I don't know, I guess maybe another 15 hours, 20 hours or so.
125.08s: And then I should be in a pretty good spot
128.20s: with what I want to get caught up on.
130.20s: The next thing on my agenda for those wondering
132.72s: is going through the economic indicators
136.52s: that we've had over the last couple of weeks.
139.44s: And not just looking at the numbers,
141.04s: but actually pulling up the reports
142.84s: and seeing what's in there.
144.40s: And then doing that going forward
147.36s: for the next four weeks or so,
148.80s: I try to keep a general understanding of trading's funny
152.60s: in that way, because there are a lot of different timeframes
156.08s: that impact us in different ways.
159.44s: So you have to be aware, even if you're trading
162.52s: something like as a shorter term time frame,
164.20s: you still have to be aware of what's going on
166.24s: and slightly longer term timeframes.
167.80s: And as you probably can infer from that,
171.44s: we're also in a really busy time of year
174.12s: with earning season well underway.
176.64s: And actually it's a much welcome source of returns right now,
180.00s: because I was talking with somebody earlier today.
183.72s: And there's a good chance that this month
188.80s: will mark a negative year to date
191.92s: return on the coverage triangle strategies,
193.92s: which actually really, really rare.
195.92s: But because of that, the speculative trading
199.36s: has become more and more important
202.60s: to continue driving over all return performance,
205.60s: because I haven't fully rotated out
207.64s: of the coverage triangle I always maintained
209.40s: some exposure there.
210.24s: It's a little excessive right now,
211.76s: based on the fact that the market was down
213.48s: under the two percent today before the end of the day.
216.16s: But all those details integrated,
219.52s: it means that it requires us to do a lot of different things.
223.00s: And I wanna spend a little time taking a look at that
225.36s: with you guys.
226.48s: Now, as always, gotta say hello
228.96s: and to explain what that post was that I shared in there,
232.88s: which is to a YouTube short,
234.72s: looks like we got Tommy Jordan H. Rees,
237.44s: laptop CEO, great to see you all.
240.04s: And as Tommy rightly and very coolly mentioned here,
244.56s: we did cross 30,000 subscribers on YouTube,
247.32s: which is, as I said every time,
249.20s: because it becomes increasingly crazy to me
252.04s: that the number continues to grow.
254.28s: I am not optimized in any significant way for YouTube,
258.24s: but it tells me that there is a group of people out there
262.44s: that are interested in how we do things.
264.60s: And kind of this thing, I call the outlier mindset,
267.96s: not like the super niche thing.
270.36s: It's accessible to everybody,
271.56s: but it is something that you kind of have to embody
274.32s: today, basis.
275.16s: So having a community of people that are interested in that
278.12s: is super cool, it's something I absolutely wish I had access to,
282.00s: because if you look across most trading communities,
287.04s: it's all about people trying to figure out
288.96s: how much money they can make, how fast with minimal effort.
292.32s: And it's a, I get that.
295.08s: We all start there because that's why we all start trading.
298.68s: I levered, there is a really important turn that happens
302.76s: when you kind of acknowledge the reality
305.20s: of what this thing actually is, what it actually looks like.
308.48s: And then you make a choice.
309.52s: Is trading either going to be something
310.96s: that I'm going to willingly commit the time to?
313.96s: Or is it something that I'm going to maybe apply the parade
318.40s: or principle and just passively invest dollar cost average?
322.04s: It's completely viable and for a lot of people
323.88s: that is the right choice.
325.68s: Trading, as I will always remind people,
327.80s: is a terrible, terrible endeavor to treat as a hobby.
331.20s: It really is because for most people
335.24s: that try to treat trading as a hobby,
337.44s: they're making such a series of suboptimal choices.
340.56s: And there's, it's all tradeoffs.
342.92s: Everything that you choose to do as a trader is a tradeoff.
346.56s: So fun enough that link that's at the top,
349.84s: I'll actually pin it.
351.32s: That's to a giveaway.
353.88s: It's just for like a portfolio review slash
356.60s: a one on one call with me,
358.08s: just a bullshit about whatever you want.
360.48s: But hopefully to take a look at what you're doing
362.16s: and see if I can provide some direct input,
364.68s: hopefully to help you.
366.00s: So you can enter for free by following
368.96s: that's link that I just pinned with some instructions.
373.24s: And then on Wednesday, we are going to have a stream
377.04s: on Wednesday this week that's going to be
378.92s: what I'm calling a war stories stream.
382.32s: And it's really just a chance to talk about some of the more
386.68s: interesting wins and losses as you all know.
390.72s: I typically prefer to talk about the losses.
392.60s: I genuinely find them much more interesting.
395.12s: But we'll talk a little bit about both.
397.96s: And the whole concept behind war stories is war stories
401.28s: are never just kind of run in the mill,
403.92s: you know, at least in the military,
406.64s: when people are telling war stories,
408.44s: it's typically like really interesting stuff.
410.84s: It's not going to be anywhere near as interesting
412.40s: as this stuff you'll hear in a true war story.
414.28s: But in a trading war story, it'll be a little bit more
417.88s: of the extremes that I actually don't talk about that much.
420.56s: And there's a really specific reason why I don't talk
423.52s: about the extremes that much.
425.32s: At both winning and losing.
427.44s: The losing stuff I've talked about before.
429.44s: So you're aware of that.
431.20s: The winning side of the equation,
433.64s: I actually very rarely talk about the really large wins
437.40s: that eventually do roll across.
441.60s: It's because I'm so cautious about setting
444.64s: the wrong expectations for people.
447.04s: And I'm very thoughtful about that.
449.00s: But the entire reason why I trade and continue to trade
452.36s: is because you can do very well.
456.16s: So I do want to talk about at least some of those instances
459.36s: because it's kind of fun to look back.
461.28s: There's a series of trades that I made a couple of years ago
464.84s: and unfortunately I'm still not ready
466.88s: to go into any significant detail.
468.68s: But I am going to at least overview some of them for you
474.28s: because it still hands down as a gross dollar amount.
478.24s: The most profitable two days have ever had my entire life.
481.32s: It's like multiples of most people's annual salaries
485.48s: over the course of two days.
487.08s: Just some of the most interesting things I've ever seen.
490.56s: But we'll talk a little bit about those on Wednesday.
495.12s: The main thing I want you to take away from that
497.32s: is not the dollar amount, although the dollar amount
499.88s: draws interest naturally.
501.56s: But it's more so to talk about the habits in the conditions
509.56s: that build those kind of opportunities
513.88s: and they take a long time.
516.24s: So pretty.
518.80s: I actually had never even thought of that.
520.88s: If I did the math on what that amount of money
524.32s: would have been on like a per hour basis,
526.80s: I'm actually now very curious.
529.04s: It's probably below minimum wage.
530.76s: Like if I, I don't think that, let me look.
533.44s: I'm so curious now, one second.
538.16s: Yeah.
539.72s: It's literally like minimum wage.
541.88s: That's actually hilarious.
544.44s: So if I look across my tire trading career,
548.32s: the return on that time is not great.
549.76s: But obviously that's not the only return I've had
552.80s: over this time.
554.12s: Fun, none, the less.
555.80s: All right.
556.64s: Let's get into the markets.
560.24s: Shall we?
562.12s: I think there's a couple high level items that I believe
567.64s: are worth starting with.
569.68s: The main thing here is the relationship
574.00s: that you see with VIX.
575.12s: It is absolutely clustering around this 30-handle.
579.24s: Interestingly enough, bonds are still doing terrible.
582.88s: I'm surprised to see bonds down as big as they were today.
586.08s: And this goes back to this really inconsistent
591.80s: relationship between equities and long-term bonds.
595.32s: I should say, given the current market environment.
597.80s: The reason why that matters is because it tells you
600.96s: about the lack of normalcy underpinning the broad
605.64s: hold on.
606.00s: It looks like we disconnected.
608.32s: And it looks like we might be back.
611.68s: Let me know if you guys can see me.
615.16s: Tell me I disconnected.
617.08s: But it looks like it's back.
619.80s: Oh, hold on.
620.40s: OK, cool.
620.92s: Thanks, Rys.
623.44s: So looking at markets like this, it gives you a lot
628.52s: of underlying context on whether or not
631.48s: we're in a healthy market environment or an unhealthy or abnormal
636.32s: and I would still consider this to be pretty abnormal.
639.20s: So what happened today?
640.52s: Today was an insane move.
642.20s: Actually speaking of losses, I got smashed today.
645.56s: On my intraday SPX positions.
649.44s: And funny enough, it's actually the first day that I
653.44s: sized up another increment based on market conditions.
656.76s: It's the psychology of a human trader is
661.36s: epically funny to me.
663.00s: Because all of the conditions based on the strategy performance
666.60s: were there based on what I look for.
669.52s: And then I was looking back over the previous trades.
672.36s: And I was just like, man, this is a pretty long
674.96s: win streak that I've had with this specific strategy.
678.84s: And I literally told myself, I was like, this
681.28s: is the exact kind of day that I innately would look to skip
686.52s: or to size down on.
689.20s: But that's really not so much how trading works.
693.88s: And I knowingly put on this trade, I sized it up,
697.08s: following the general plan against my gut,
700.36s: which is saying, don't do it.
702.84s: And I'm glad I did it, but it was a full loss.
705.68s: So yeah, I guess for what the trade was,
708.72s: it was full loss today.
709.80s: Perfect.
710.96s: The exact thing that you want as soon as you size up
713.20s: the strategy.
714.32s: Now, joking aside, there is an important lesson
717.48s: I want to share here.
718.60s: And that lesson is sometimes following the plan
724.24s: for the right reasons is better than breaking away
729.00s: from the plan, potentially making money,
732.40s: which is the entirely wrong reason.
736.32s: There's a really delicate balance between this gut
740.16s: instinct element as a trader, especially
742.60s: if you're a discretionary trader, which almost,
744.96s: I mean, the overwhelming majority of retail traders
747.40s: are discretionary because it's very difficult
749.92s: to be purely algorithmic.
753.08s: You have to strike a healthy balance between those gut
756.92s: instincts, fears, senses that you have
761.00s: versus what you actually ultimately end up doing.
763.92s: And it's something that I don't pretend to have fully
767.36s: fleshed out right now.
768.68s: It's something that I track pretty carefully, actually.
772.72s: And funny enough, I genuinely am starting to get to the point
776.52s: where on some of the deviations,
779.24s: I literally might start allowing a little more gut intervention,
784.24s: but there's a broader problem, I suspect if I do that.
788.36s: And the problem I suspect, if I do that,
791.24s: will be as I do it, the propensity for me
794.60s: to want to intervene will actually go up.
797.60s: And then right now, the slightly positive performance
801.36s: that I see from those gut interventions,
803.24s: probably would normalize to either flat or negative.
807.60s: Now, the thing to keep in mind is I'm not talking
809.84s: about deviations from a fully specific automated strategy
815.16s: to then deviating off of it.
817.20s: There's a lot of much everything that I do already
818.76s: has discretion, but I have discretion that's
821.52s: baked within boundaries.
823.48s: In some times, I look to violate those boundaries for one
828.24s: reason or another.
829.08s: It's just a fascinating, just processing of information.
838.24s: It's something that I find to be legitimately incredible
842.12s: with the human mind, how it processes that stuff,
844.60s: but also how valuable it is.
847.00s: So this move that you saw on TLT on healthy compared to equities.
851.88s: The move that you saw today was unhealthy.
855.20s: The move today was kind of nuts if you think about it.
859.72s: Now, it's not nuts in the context of,
863.08s: I mean, we're still in a declining channel, right?
866.00s: Like that's as clear as day.
867.16s: There's no ifans bots about that,
869.40s: like that is what it is.
870.60s: This is absolutely a declining channel.
873.72s: The way that this starts to behave around this 4963
877.28s: handle down here matters quite a lot
879.16s: if it gets back down there.
881.04s: The reason why that matters so much is because this is still
884.64s: in a spot where it can start challenging prior highs,
889.20s: local highs, and reestablish at least interim uptrend.
894.08s: But right now, this is a resumption of the downtrend.
896.36s: I actually have some broad short deltas directly in the indices.
902.04s: And part of that is because it's a slightly better hedge
904.56s: for me than trying to play the movement of volatility
907.56s: for those that don't know.
909.36s: There's a lot of different ways you could play volatility.
911.28s: But volatility is its own thing,
913.36s: and it behaves very differently.
915.64s: So if you choose to try to hedge,
918.20s: let's say, for example, a broad portfolio
920.32s: of beta-weighted deltas with volatility you can.
923.80s: But it generally doesn't really
926.12s: behave the way that you think it might.
928.72s: So for me, it is a hedge, though, to be very, very clear.
932.48s: A lot of times I say that I might be playing something
938.00s: to the other direction based on the broad market
941.68s: tilt simply to some, oh, weird.
944.84s: Why does it keep doing this?
948.68s: So it keeps disconnecting and reconnecting.
951.76s: We might need to do, what can I do here?
955.28s: It seems fine.
957.04s: I'm going to close OBS really fast.
960.36s: And then I'm going to see if I can run it as admin,
963.24s: make it a little more important.
964.76s: Oh, actually, let me second.
967.12s: Maybe if I bump it up in Tasman.
969.72s: Oh, here we go.
988.88s: All right.
993.32s: So I just up the priority and see if that helps.
1001.48s: That's honestly super weird.
1003.48s: Really, really weird that it's being that inconsistent.
1007.88s: We'll see if this helps.
1010.72s: If you really look fine, otherwise.
1015.88s: But back to this, it is a dedicated hedge.
1020.44s: And it's because right now I am still sized pretty heavy for the coverage
1024.88s: triangles based on what the market is doing in general.
1028.72s: So I definitely want to scrub some of those delta's off.
1033.08s: And the other big stuff I'm working on is kind of what we talked about during the pro
1036.84s: stream yesterday.
1038.60s: Most of that is earnings plays.
1040.76s: I have a couple of directional plays that I put on today.
1043.88s: The portfolio still isn't fully where I want it to be in terms of total utilization,
1050.72s: but it's much closer.
1052.32s: So it's about, I mean, I could do nothing now and it would be about right, but I still
1057.68s: would like to scale a little bit more.
1061.12s: So that is the near term game plan for the broader portfolio.
1066.12s: Now all that aside, let's take a look at the actual move today, because I really was interested
1070.72s: in it.
1071.80s: You can see that there is this just massive dump right on the open.
1075.76s: And then I mean, it just absolutely continued this trend all the way until like 11.05,
1083.00s: ish 11.05.
1085.88s: And then it had a pretty abnormal move outside of here.
1090.24s: So if you take a look at this move in here, this was a 1.25% move.
1095.72s: That's a big move in and of itself.
1098.08s: But then if you think about the close to the open, that shows you a 0.94% move from the
1106.96s: open to the low of the day.
1109.60s: If it lets me click here, it's about 2.57%.
1116.76s: And then it rallied back up about 1.25%.
1120.20s: That is a fairly significant range on the day.
1126.88s: Because I think a big reason why you're seeing this kind of volatility stepping into the
1132.08s: equation has a lot to do with how the market is positioned.
1137.92s: And there's still pure uncertainty around pretty much all of this.
1143.12s: And I think that's important to pay attention to because this idea of like the Trump
1147.12s: terror of being paused for 90 days in the original market reaction to that, it's showing you
1152.64s: that it's not enough.
1154.84s: And it's actually starting to notice more fear on top of that.
1158.08s: The talking points you'll see for today is because of Trump challenging the independence
1169.08s: of the Federal Reserve, right?
1170.48s: Like you could see that from page here.
1172.72s: Here's the problem.
1174.12s: There's no freaking change to this.
1176.08s: Trump has been doing this and talking this way to Powell and about the Fed since before
1183.20s: he was elected.
1184.52s: So this, in my opinion, is another example where we're looking for a clean talking point
1190.96s: to tie things to and I actually think a big driver of what happened today has to do with
1196.68s: positioning.
1198.48s: And I think the positioning is likely to continue to be as low as it is, especially as we
1203.24s: go through earnings.
1204.92s: Because we're now getting a pretty good look into how companies are surviving.
1210.44s: And it's tenuous.
1212.52s: The forecasts that we're getting right now are all pretty soft and you're still seeing
1218.68s: the same kind of broad flows that you might expect during a constrained market.
1225.48s: And I'll show you what I mean by this.
1227.68s: So let's grab.
1228.92s: Here.
1229.92s: No, this isn't what I want to.
1238.96s: Now, this isn't.
1240.96s: Oh, I got to sign in one second.
1247.96s: Here we go.
1256.96s: So take a look at this.
1260.96s: If you take a look at the S&P 500 in terms of overall positioning, it is been.
1266.96s: Solled off heavily, absolutely heavily for the last like two months consecutive.
1280.28s: The broad market, I think is still continuing to unwind a lot of these positions.
1286.16s: If you take a look at the broad changes on the day, even staples is starting to come off.
1293.76s: The reason why staples coming off matters is because this is where a lot of people go
1298.72s: to try to find a safe haven during challenged markets, meaning we don't really know what's
1303.24s: going to go on.
1304.24s: We think that it might be more likely for a recession, all of these sorts of things.
1309.00s: And this starting to tailor down is absolutely broad speaking big sign of weakness.
1320.76s: The fact that the outflows accelerated this heavily in terms of across the various sectors,
1328.48s: real estate doesn't really surprise me that people are starting to try to move a little
1333.20s: bit of money into real estate just because it does start to become slightly more interesting
1337.56s: here with the yields it can provide.
1340.28s: I don't think that we're looking at this in terms of housing crisis coming up.
1344.12s: I still think mortgage and mortgage performance doesn't look that bad, but let's see.
1349.64s: I haven't looked, so we'll be able to eyeball this together.
1355.52s: Gotta get into my.
1359.64s: Let's take a look at.
1371.48s: All right.
1373.76s: So I want you to look at the blue.
1376.88s: The blue here is charge offs, the link when sea rates for residential mortgages.
1387.00s: And it is up ticking slightly, not terrible, but it is absolutely up ticking slightly.
1395.52s: Let's see if we could take a look at one more.
1403.76s: Now that's what we already have.
1414.72s: Now I don't want to ease.
1420.28s: This is what.
1421.68s: We'll do the last five.
1433.92s: Here you go.
1435.24s: So this looks interesting to me because service payments are kind of steady as a percentage
1443.88s: of disposable income.
1444.88s: This is one of the things that's been so weird with the current economy is that consumer
1452.08s: is still not being.
1453.92s: Like they're they're not in a terrible spot, which is just surprising to me.
1461.32s: They quite surprising to me.
1464.72s: Ah, take a look at this.
1472.20s: Consumer credit card balances starting to rise up actually pretty significantly.
1479.08s: The target originations is about flat.
1482.76s: He's too about onch.
1484.16s: There's not anything there that's drawn my attention.
1493.56s: This is the other that I wanted to look at.
1496.84s: So personal consumption is going up.
1502.20s: But personal savings rate is also holding in there.
1506.56s: The fact that personal savings rate is also still hanging in there is kind of positive
1514.12s: to me.
1519.60s: All this means to me as I look at it is that there's not a clear picture yet on the total
1524.08s: impact of the consumer.
1525.52s: But I have got to assume as soon as we start seeing the consumer being a little bit more
1530.68s: suppressed that you'll see that reflected here.
1535.32s: Joe mentioned housing signs for sales signs going up.
1539.64s: So let's take a look really quick and see if there's anything that sticks out to us
1543.68s: from that lens.
1544.68s: And then I want to take a look at a couple stocks specifically with earnings coming up.
1552.20s: So let's see.
1554.80s: Let's get rid of.
1557.04s: Let's go to just 20 25 will compare it against last year.
1562.92s: And Joe says seeing more houses for sales signs.
1567.56s: Yeah, I mean, it looks like what you're seeing so far.
1572.20s: Tracks is essentially new sales is gone up.
1579.48s: 2% from the start of the year and it's now up 3.8%.
1584.80s: So I think that that's that seems to be right.
1590.80s: But sales prices are still going up.
1596.60s: They're still going up like handedly.
1598.80s: Wow.
1606.40s: Price index up.
1609.52s: So yeah, it does look like things definitely are coming up more for sale.
1613.92s: I mean, I think there's going to be a lot of people that are going to be positioning pretty
1618.64s: conservatively now.
1620.60s: So for people that have money, the way that they look at it is if you maintain decent
1628.92s: cash opportunities are going to be popping up.
1631.96s: And this is even something that I'm doing right now with the real estate side of what I do.
1638.16s: A lot of the properties that we have were still looking to build and expand them is best
1644.32s: as we can.
1645.72s: But we're not looking to take on a bunch of debt here because of the cost of the debt.
1650.36s: It's just not worth it.
1652.76s: So most of the stuff that we're doing is being internally financed.
1656.84s: Now, one of the things that I do keep an eye on, it's kind of like bargain shopping is
1661.88s: looking for distress sellers because especially in the commercial real estate world, there's
1666.44s: a certain amount of money that you have to maintain in order to even continue business,
1671.40s: manage payrolls.
1673.20s: And if that kind of funding dips too low, it puts you in a really bad spot where you have
1677.12s: to start scaling critical components that you otherwise really don't want to or shouldn't
1681.96s: for the sake of your business.
1683.68s: So places like that sometimes they'll intervene early enough with themselves and say, okay,
1687.68s: like don't have the finances with what this is generating given the current markets.
1692.08s: And I don't have to spare cash to feed into it to maintain it.
1695.40s: So those kinds of places sometimes can come across as distressed sellers, which generally
1701.16s: you can get better deals for because it's not quite a fire sale every time, but
1706.40s: frequently it is a little bit more fire sale.
1709.12s: But you're also going to be picking up something that's slightly challenged and you
1712.40s: kind of know that going into it.
1714.48s: So I think real estate right now is going to continue to show a little bit of that now
1720.24s: of note, however, I do think that you're going to see as always real estate bifurcate.
1728.64s: It's very regional.
1730.60s: And I think you're going to continue to see things like office buildings, for example.
1736.04s: Now return to office is actually been a bigger deal than I think some people expected
1740.92s: it to be.
1741.92s: But as long as that continues to be as it is, then it is quite likely to see office buildings
1749.40s: themselves struggling.
1750.88s: But that opens the door for office building conversions.
1754.68s: The other things, especially if you can pick them up from distress sellers.
1758.24s: All right.
1758.60s: So let's see what's going on for earnings so far.
1764.08s: We have a beat and a beat, two beats.
1770.40s: Interesting.
1771.40s: Now so far there's been, if you checked out my newsletter from the past week, I shared
1775.92s: some of the recent earnings statistics and just general data for your context.
1782.08s: And there's still a lot of overall beats, but beats become expected.
1789.96s: It's really important to understand how earnings work.
1793.80s: And it's worth a quick revisit as a collective.
1800.08s: So let's look at an example here.
1803.68s: Let's say that you have stock Apple or XYZ, whatever.
1808.32s: We have Apple.
1810.04s: This is of Apple.
1810.96s: The reason why I'm using a stock like this is because it's going to be highly covered.
1813.64s: There's going to be a lot of analysts.
1815.24s: Let's say each one of these nodes is an analyst that covers Apple.
1821.72s: Here's what happens.
1823.28s: All of these different picks.
1825.00s: The first thing to note, number one, is a lot of them directly hold Apple.
1836.32s: The second thing to note, a lot of their clients hold Apple.
1845.64s: This is what we would call a conflict of interest.
1848.88s: If I'm going to try to evaluate something objectively, if I have this scenario going on,
1855.56s: that's a conflict of interest, does that mean that that conflict of interest every single
1859.64s: time leads to some sort of fuckery now?
1862.08s: These a lot of them will maintain a longer term position in Apple.
1865.76s: And thus, that means they're actually highly incentivized to analyze it well.
1871.08s: What fuckery comes afoot is let's say one of them is looking to pair down their position
1877.52s: in Apple.
1879.24s: What you need exit liquidity.
1881.20s: How can you generate exit liquidity?
1883.36s: You can have something that beats your expectations massively leads to a lot of people saying,
1887.92s: like, oh, wow, this smash to the upside, let me go buy Apple.
1892.52s: And as people are buying it up, one of these places can be selling it into that buying
1896.32s: pressure.
1897.32s: There's your exit liquidity.
1898.32s: That kind of stuff.
1899.72s: So it's just important to note that that exists to what degree it goes on.
1903.16s: I genuinely don't know.
1904.96s: But I know that the conflict of interest is there.
1907.08s: And I know that all of these kinds of institutions are highly motivated to make as much
1910.56s: money as humanly possible.
1911.92s: And they're willing to step on other heads to do it.
1913.92s: I know that.
1914.92s: So anyways, we have all these different analysts.
1918.32s: Let's say Apple, if everybody does their absolute best due diligence, let's say that
1924.96s: they think Apple's going to make a dollar for share.
1929.56s: Well, what ends up happening is let's say that your best analysis, the absolute
1936.68s: best analysis you can come up with, this is what you really think it's going to be
1939.76s: as a dollar.
1940.76s: And then all of a sudden, you put in your dollar and it comes in short for whatever
1946.20s: reason it comes in at 95 cents.
1948.20s: Well, what happens?
1949.64s: We've conditioned the market now to think that this is a big giant miss in that leads
1955.16s: to big massive down moves.
1957.92s: Well, that doesn't look good if you're holding the stock.
1963.32s: And if maybe you're coming up on a quarterly outpreaf, and you need to show your performance
1968.20s: for the past quarter, if Apple's down, that's not good.
1971.76s: So what we've done is we've built this like kitty playground where a beat is a hit.
1982.92s: And if you're struggling to follow me here, if you think about what the average number
1988.72s: of earnings beats is over an earnings quarter, it's literally over like 70% for S&P 500
1996.28s: names.
1997.28s: You have to ask yourself, S&P 500 names, biggest stocks, followed
2001.72s: by the biggest institutions with conceivably the smartest people, how the fuck are they
2008.56s: that off that always?
2012.24s: How?
2015.52s: There's a reason.
2016.76s: And it's not because they can't figure it out.
2019.24s: They fucking can if they're so inclined.
2021.56s: And I'm sure they do internally.
2024.68s: But the reality is there's also a shaming function.
2030.16s: If best estimate is a dollar and let's say all of these different nodes save for this
2038.08s: node come up with a dollar.
2040.84s: And this node says, you know what, I think it's going to be a dollar five for whatever
2044.36s: reason.
2045.36s: Well, if it comes in close to this dollar, this dollar five now just sticks out like a sore
2053.16s: thumb completely fucked it up.
2055.96s: Everybody else, the rest of the pack stays together.
2059.16s: So then what happens?
2060.88s: Let's say everybody instead came up with a dollar and it came in at a dollar five.
2067.96s: What happens?
2069.52s: Everybody's wrong together universally about the same.
2072.60s: Nobody sticks out.
2073.76s: There's no red paint on anybody's face.
2075.56s: It's kind of business is usual.
2076.88s: Ah, okay.
2077.88s: We all got this.
2079.68s: So the reason why all of this matters is because when you're analyzing earnings, when
2085.84s: you see an actual beat, that is essentially a hit, it's what they should be doing.
2093.68s: And it's because of the way that analysts produce their targets and it's become this generalized
2101.36s: expectation that there's going to be a beat.
2106.36s: So this is also why you'll see different reactions to beats and misses.
2113.92s: The reason why is because the overall expectations for a beat, the market thinks most names
2120.64s: are going to be.
2122.20s: So then when you have something that misses, if we know that we graded them with kid
2126.88s: gloves so to speak, and then there's a miss that's a massive problem.
2131.72s: So the game of trading earnings is really interesting from a psychological perspective in
2138.44s: terms of understanding what's going on under the hood.
2141.24s: But then there's the fun part of this, which includes trading the actual earnings releases
2149.56s: themselves.
2150.56s: And again, yesterday during the pro live stream, we looked through a few of these.
2155.12s: So I want to talk and follow up on a couple of them.
2159.56s: So if we take a look at the names for today, there's HAL really HAL.
2168.64s: There is RTX as well, but that didn't pass the test.
2172.96s: HAL ended up being the primary name.
2176.92s: So let's take a quick look.
2178.96s: They report before the open tomorrow.
2181.08s: But let's take a quick look at their options so that we can do a little bit of analysis
2186.00s: together.
2187.28s: So the first thing is coming into this.
2189.76s: The stock price on the closest 2192.
2193.28s: The expiration volatility is 80.47.
2196.84s: What I'm doing is I'm calculating the event specific.
2199.88s: The ticker ball is 51.13, 51.13, and day's expiration at this point is 4.
2212.64s: So the event volatility for this itself is about 134.4%.
2222.64s: The expected move for that takes it to 6.77% with an event expected move of roughly 1.48.
2233.32s: $48.
2234.40s: This is tracking it at a $1.14.
2236.64s: It's a little bit light, a little bit too light, by the way.
2240.80s: So if we take a look at the options chain here, I typically run things around the 20 delta
2248.68s: on something like this.
2250.44s: You're still collecting over a percent.
2252.56s: There's no reason to spread these off although it definitely can move.
2257.20s: And we can see after hours right now, it's not really doing a whole lot.
2261.16s: It's kind of sitting tight.
2263.32s: So this completely viable play.
2266.40s: This is via just short strangles.
2269.12s: And I run it at the 21 and the 19.
2273.56s: These get put on literally right before the close.
2278.24s: So these will, we'll see what happens.
2281.72s: Now in terms of how I choose to manage them tomorrow, that'll be highly dependent on what
2286.04s: the market looks like.
2287.24s: But overwhelming majority of instances is going to be at least waiting the first 15 minutes
2292.28s: for that vault to bleed out.
2294.28s: And then we'll make some decisions from there.
2296.56s: So now the other thing that I think is worth looking at are a couple of the names for tomorrow
2301.32s: after the close.
2302.32s: There's a couple that looked good.
2305.56s: Definitely not Tesla, but I want to look at Tesla.
2309.56s: Tesla, we passed on our screen yesterday for a bunch of different reasons.
2313.32s: But I just want to see what this is pricing in as well.
2318.12s: So stock price 227.5, exp revol 145, 55, pickervol 94.9, DTE4, 240 and a quarter of that vault.
2335.12s: That puts us at 12.11%.
2337.84s: The expected move.
2339.12s: This is calculating is like 27.54.
2341.88s: So this is still way too light.
2343.28s: And that's actually one of the things that we saw when we were pricing it yesterday was
2347.72s: if I grab over at it again really quick.
2350.96s: The overall vault was priced way, way, way too cheap.
2356.04s: Let's see what this shows us.
2359.80s: So this is pricing in X, yes, see it's right now it's pricing in expected move of 9.8%
2367.20s: with an average actual move of 10.1.
2370.20s: So 0.3% edge to the implied vault side with everything that's going on with Tesla.
2377.08s: To me seems like a bad trade.
2379.32s: Now, that doesn't mean that it can't, again, it can any one of these individual names,
2383.60s: despite all this shit that I'm saying, could always work perfectly.
2387.68s: But you have to remember the entire scope of a trader's lens is not how does this one
2395.16s: individual thing work out.
2397.48s: It's always how do or how does this approach work out in the long run?
2406.76s: There are thousands and thousands of occurrences.
2409.84s: So it's really important as you hear me talk about this stuff.
2412.80s: It's not so much predictive.
2413.96s: I don't know what's going to happen.
2415.76s: But what I do is I wait the probabilities and then I position in what I consider to be the
2421.56s: optimal way that I can position given what the probabilities are.
2426.24s: And I look to lean on those for the long run.
2429.08s: Now if you take a look for the volume today, there is a lot of sold puts coming in
2436.76s: at the bid.
2437.72s: That's actually kind of interesting.
2438.72s: Let's take a look at the volume.
2443.72s: I want to actually look at what the, what the true behavior was.
2450.08s: I don't just care about the numbers.
2451.84s: That's why I'm saying like the volume itself is useful from like a gross number perspective.
2457.04s: But it's limited because we also want to see the dollar amounts, the dollar amounts matter
2462.16s: a lot.
2465.16s: So let's see.
2472.16s: Yeah.
2473.16s: So so.
2480.16s: Lot of earnings place.
2481.16s: Take a look at this.
2482.16s: So if you take a look at the earnings across the board, this is a lot of, wow.
2492.16s: Let's see.
2504.16s: I want to get a sense of what the movement was.
2508.16s: I'm so like dollar deltas.
2513.16s: Look at.
2521.16s: I want to make a filter.
2527.16s: Try to use more narrow filter.
2529.16s: Why?
2530.16s: Is it because there are too many names?
2536.16s: Let's just take a look at.
2543.16s: And let's sort this by.
2551.16s: So a bunch of sold puts.
2557.16s: Wow.
2558.16s: I mean, these are big tradesmen.
2560.16s: These are really big trades just for this, this expiration.
2566.16s: The interesting thing too is in terms of both.
2570.16s: Vanna and charm.
2573.16s: This kind of positioning absolutely will cause ripples in the underlying.
2580.16s: This is pretty significant.
2584.16s: Overall, long side premium today was what 750 million seven 89.
2591.16s: The slight edge to bear side plays of some sort.
2595.16s: You can't really.
2597.16s: I'd advise it quite like that.
2599.16s: They just do.
2600.16s: Let there's some limitations with doing that.
2603.16s: That's really interesting.
2607.16s: Let's take a look through a couple of things really fast.
2611.16s: I got each month.
2615.16s: I do an AMA on Reddit and I do it in the option sub because I remember when I was in enterprising
2625.16s: option trader trying to learn going into different online forums.
2630.16s: How difficult it was to find things one that I trusted.
2635.16s: And then two people that weren't kind of assholes.
2639.16s: So I tried to at least offer a different perspective for people.
2645.16s: And there was a couple really interesting.
2648.16s: Conversation points from the AMA that I want to talk about.
2652.16s: So let me show you a couple of these.
2657.16s: And before we do that to other things, one of them.
2663.16s: I recently launched a mini series for the Friday stream, which is outlier options trading foundations.
2675.16s: The purpose of the Friday mini series is to try and provide what I consider to be the correct
2683.16s: foundation bedrock to even begin learning about options or trading in general.
2690.16s: So it's not going to be highly tactical always use this Delta always buy always sell.
2696.16s: It's none of that stuff.
2698.16s: It's going to be trying to help you understand how to even think about solving this problem set and how to solve it in a logical order.
2706.16s: And the kind of things you need to do in order to solve the problem set of figuring out how to trade.
2713.16s: A lot of traders mistakenly start running down the path of what stock should I trade, what expiration should I trade,
2719.16s: what technical analysis indicate or should I use.
2722.16s: And the reality is those are literally literally all the wrong questions to worry about upfront.
2727.16s: They don't fucking matter at all at that point.
2729.16s: Well, matters upfront is developing a rock solid foundation to be able to iterate off of because here's the next thing I literally can guarantee you.
2739.16s: No matter what you pick in the beginning is going to suck and it's not going to work.
2744.16s: The only way you're going to be able to identify that though and then successfully pivot is if you have a good foundation then work off of to then iterate.
2752.16s: So it will be for the next four Fridays I'm planning four weeks.
2758.16s: I'm actually really looking forward to this one because a lot of the outlier options trading basics and boot camps that we do is more about like the tactical what is an option and that kind of stuff which will get back to those.
2771.16s: I do a couple of those per year, but this one is really designed to be a little more meta, but with very specific takeaways after each module that we do.
2783.16s: So I think it'll be useful.
2785.16s: The second thing is in a broad nutshell with markets how they are right now.
2797.16s: I cannot express how important I think it is to try and move slow to test ideas right now should be one of the busiest paper trading parts of your life because there's so many ideas and nuanced variations of things you get to try.
2817.16s: But the ability to call successfully what's going to happen here is about null it is such a crap shoot and if you find yourself oversized just in terms of your overall portfolio utilization now.
2833.16s: The ability to get absolutely smashed is profound you have to be aware of that you have to be aware of that if you're not aware of that you're really putting yourself in a dangerous spot.
2846.16s: So something to keep in the back of your mind is you go through these kinds of markets there's nothing wrong with testing ideas, but it is important to test ideas logically and to monitor your size carefully because it is very easily.
2861.16s: Very easy to get oversized and if the market decides to just continue to rotate over and roll down which it absolutely can do it seems more likely right now than it doesn't based on the current information that's out there.
2904.16s: So, yeah so Q's is literally just at a bear market now 20 down 20% that's on the close so Q's is there and spy I think is close but not quite.
2919.16s: 16.4 so deep correction respite.
2929.16s: The reason why I'm mentioning this is it's not even like we're in the throes of a bear market on our way out this is very much like we it's like on the cusp of a bear market you can take a look.
2944.16s: Pies and lows this is super important why is this so important it's because net lows has slowed a lot net lows was expanding tremendously over this period and you can see just based on you know the distribution in the plot.
2966.16s: But that part of side you can still see that it's come down a lot so when you see net lows slowing down like this it is a potential.
2978.16s: So, the market flattening out starting to consolidate not accelerating to the downside heavily right now until the next piece of news comes out and as soon as the next piece of news comes out as you all know.
2989.16s: And it's going to be whatever it's going to be it can be absolutely wild or it can be pretty mellow but.
2995.16s: The important thing to keep in mind here is that if I see net lows starting to expand meaningfully that tells me acceleration to the downside which is not actually the case right now contrary to what I might expect.
3009.16s: A laptop says what's your definition of bear market standard definition 20% decline off of local highs that's like the definition.
3017.16s: I frame it that way because a lot of people have like in opinion on different things.
3023.16s: But that one is not really one to have an opinion on it's kind of is what it is.
3029.16s: So now as I mentioned before let's take a quick stroll through red it.
3037.16s: And let's see what we can learn.
3041.16s: Um, this one I thought was interesting because of this question and it's something to pay attention to as a trader so this person essentially saying how much do I use for trading out of my net worth and then what goes into safe assets.
3057.16s: 爾.
3062.16s: I think these terms line positive in about 30s and so on and then what back from the article starting $rop till also like 1.
3071.16s: And with 40 billion wheels on 34.
3075.16s: Even with how fortunate and successful.
3078.16s: I've been so far in the world of trading and then also just we have been successful as a family is.
3086.16s: So because of all that stuff, I really don't think, quote unquote,
3091.42s: safe assets make much sense at all.
3095.00s: If you were to take a look in my checking account, my checking account
3099.24s: maintains a pretty insignificant amount of money on a monthly basis.
3104.80s: What goes in there is enough to cover all of our general expenses, right?
3109.72s: Average expenses month over month with a little bit of a pat on top of that.
3113.88s: I don't even have money in a savings account.
3116.52s: I don't have money in a CD account.
3118.40s: Everything else is utilized.
3120.36s: It's either in brokerage accounts trading.
3122.76s: It's in real estate.
3123.72s: It's in other things.
3125.60s: So I don't really maintain a massive net in that way.
3129.28s: Now that being said, the stuff that does get earmarked or
3136.76s: living expenses and emergency expenses is in what I would consider to be
3141.04s: less risky assets, but it's not in the context of what this is.
3144.96s: Most people when they say safe assets, they're thinking things like
3148.72s: zero coupon bonds or they're thinking things like CD accounts or
3154.64s: savings accounts, stuff like that.
3157.12s: And with inflation where it is now, the overall propensity is for
3161.20s: that money essentially just to get chewed away.
3163.24s: It's not what I want.
3167.00s: Let's take a look at this one and try to remember this one.
3173.52s: So this person essentially is saying, what is a good size for a new
3179.04s: trader's account to be?
3181.24s: And it's funny because the way that I think about doing this is the
3187.00s: more money you can put into your investing account, the better off you are.
3190.44s: That doesn't mean you trade all of it, especially when you're beginning.
3194.16s: It's actually kind of funny because when you're first learning to trade,
3198.80s: the only thing that matters is your ability to put on the
3202.24s: minimal viable product, meaning a one lot of whatever it is that you're
3206.00s: trying to trade.
3207.12s: And if you're trading things that have unlimited risk, for example,
3211.84s: stuff like that, I simply would cap the risk by a wing while you're
3216.56s: learning.
3217.36s: So you don't actually need to have like this big account, but the problem
3222.00s: is, is most traders when they think like this, is they're like, I'm going to
3226.08s: get a $5,000 account and then I'm just going to use the $5,000.
3230.96s: Your ability to learn trading with a $5,000 account is there, but it's not great.
3237.00s: And it's because when you're trading with such a small account, you have to make such
3240.96s: a series of trade-offs that inherently compromises what you're doing.
3244.68s: This is why I think paper trading is so useful because if you don't paper trade and then
3249.56s: you start trading with your $5,000, $10,000, the overwhelming probabilities you're
3253.32s: going to light it on fire, making stupid mistakes.
3255.44s: Not even good mistakes, the learn from just stupid mistakes that absolutely could have
3259.88s: been avoided.
3261.16s: So I think like the good, the optimal size for a learning account really depends on
3268.68s: your approach to trading.
3270.44s: And if you say, well, Eric, I don't have an approach to trading.
3273.60s: Well, then what are you even doing?
3277.20s: If you have no approach to trading, you're not at a spot to even worry about what size
3280.72s: account it means that you need to learn an approach.
3284.52s: And when I talk about the different ways to learn an approach, that's something like the
3287.72s: outlier strategy process, which again, it's just a framework for thinking.
3293.12s: It's not just or prescriptive, but it does give you something in my opinion to go off of.
3300.00s: So if we take a look at the outlier strategy process, this is all it is.
3307.16s: We're going to figure out how something makes money.
3310.40s: We're going to figure out what that thing behaves like and how to identify it.
3315.40s: And then we're going to figure out how we can trade it.
3318.60s: You have to do some version of this process, whether it's well defined like this, or if
3323.12s: it's something that you're just kind of cobbling together, you have to do this.
3327.16s: And again, as I will continue to mention, most traders, they just start with this.
3331.88s: They start thinking like, oh, well, what vertical spread makes the most sense.
3337.12s: And it's always just like, yo, that doesn't matter right now.
3340.76s: What matters is you defining what the hell you're trying to trade, why it makes money and
3345.32s: how it makes money.
3346.32s: That's what matters right now, with most people skip right by that.
3349.84s: So with the learning account, it's literally the minimal viable product based on whatever
3353.64s: the strategy is that you're trading.
3355.72s: And then there's one more, this one.
3359.56s: This one is such a common thing.
3362.36s: I've literally made a video about this concept of trading options for a living because
3368.80s: like literally just about everybody that I talked to gets a completely wrong.
3373.04s: And that's not Eric saying that from the lens of everybody else is wrong and Eric is so
3378.64s: smart that he has it figured out.
3380.76s: It's the opposite.
3382.04s: I thought the same exact shit as everybody else until you start getting closer to that threshold
3388.32s: and you're like, wait a minute.
3389.72s: As I like legitimately look at this, it doesn't fucking work like this.
3394.24s: So the broader point here is let's take a look at their approach and let me know what you
3400.80s: think if this is good or not good and why.
3406.36s: So their plan is to have a core position in the stock they like and understand well.
3410.88s: They're going to sell calls on a portion of the position to generate income.
3414.72s: They're going to sell one volatility cycle is coming to an end and liquidity cycle is
3419.42s: beginning.
3420.62s: Take profits generated from the short calls we use to sell puts near an effective floor
3427.74s: of the stock based on their assessment of liquidity cycle before vaults, little cycles.
3432.74s: So that's their technical analysis side of things.
3434.58s: I'm not weighing in on that either way.
3436.30s: That's okay.
3437.30s: And they're saying that they don't want to get a sign on the puts, but if they do, they'll
3441.58s: add to the core position based on a price that they're comfortable with.
3445.18s: So then they're saying that they'd obviously have to build a position that's large enough
3449.54s: in order to make enough money off of the covered calls and cash secure puts.
3455.30s: Beyond the million of small little things, you can point out with respect to the general
3462.44s: approach, the robustness of the approach, you have to think about what matters most.
3468.70s: And this is the part that most people completely, completely don't pay attention to.
3475.22s: What matters most when you're trading for a living to generate income, to live off of
3482.26s: is robustness.
3484.66s: The reason why robustness matters is because a lot of people who have a W2 job, they
3490.66s: actually like they think like, oh, I'm like really safe and secure.
3493.94s: I have a lot of job security and maybe you do, maybe you don't.
3497.30s: But what I remind people with the W2 job is you're literally one firing away from having
3502.90s: no income.
3503.90s: That's really not, it's really not that robust if you think about it.
3509.62s: This is why investing, whether or not you choose to be a trader or not is so important.
3513.98s: Because you really do need to diversify your sources of money.
3518.42s: Now, for this person, what they're doing is grossly overweighting their desire for something
3526.86s: that's simple to do.
3528.74s: Here's the problem with this.
3530.94s: Think of any stock that you like and understand well.
3536.34s: We'll literally do an example together and we'll literally click through it because it's
3539.62s: not going to take that long.
3541.26s: Let's take a look at Nvidia.
3545.22s: And let's go back to three years.
3547.98s: Nvidia by all accounts was seen as hyper-successful talk of the town.
3554.26s: Let's say that we started messing with Nvidia when it was around 142 on the 20, what is
3563.10s: this?
3564.42s: October 22.
3566.74s: So let's go there.
3579.82s: So I'm going back in time to October of 22.
3583.62s: The reason why I'm going back here is because Nvidia just broke up of this recent consolidation,
3588.66s: all the moving averages are ascending by all accounts of the stock looks good.
3593.02s: Lots and lots of people are really into Nvidia for a lot of different reasons.
3598.74s: It's a well-positioned company and so on and so forth.
3603.50s: Okay.
3604.66s: All that stuff, great.
3607.90s: So now let's take a look.
3611.10s: I'm going to grab where you add here.
3617.74s: I'm going to grab a worksheet for us to take a look.
3632.02s: Okay.
3635.30s: So let's grab this and I'm going to grab one of the covered-stringled trackers that you all
3645.14s: have seen on the up-times.
3652.22s: This one.
3662.22s: You just have to wish stuff down.
3674.02s: All right.
3675.26s: So what I'm going to do is just literally clear all this out.
3688.14s: This matters.
3689.10s: One of this matters.
3692.10s: One of this.
3694.10s: Okay.
3695.10s: And Wayne get rid of this.
3697.10s: Beautiful.
3698.10s: Lengthsly.
3700.10s: So let's literally just work through a hypothetical scenario based on that person's idea.
3711.10s: If you haven't put the pieces together, this isn't really about this individual person's
3716.10s: idea.
3717.10s: This is about an approach that's so pervasive but so dangerous.
3722.26s: So let's say that your allocation to not teachable cues to Nvidia.
3731.42s: The first question actually to even use this as an exercise.
3735.42s: The first question is, we need to figure out how much income we need.
3739.82s: That's the very first thing we have to figure out.
3741.22s: So do you guys want to throw numbers out so I can use at least one of your scenarios so
3748.26s: that we can have something, I guess that's at least directly applicable to you?
3755.18s: So I'm referring to this on like a monthly basis.
3758.54s: What kind of income comes to your mind when you think about this from a monthly basis?
3769.06s: And come requirement.
3780.06s: Okay.
3781.38s: So far it looks like nobody.
3783.54s: So, oh, perfect.
3785.54s: A lot of top.
3786.54s: That's you read my mind.
3788.78s: This is like a very common number that I see when people talk about this.
3794.14s: So it's literally, it's literally perfect.
3797.78s: So $10,000 a month.
3801.46s: Now let's just first start by postulating return potential.
3808.34s: What's a reasonable return potential that you can think of to make this $10,000 per month.
3816.90s: We're going to worry about that later.
3818.78s: But I'm just thinking over the course of a year.
3823.54s: What do you think a reasonable return would be to consistently make this amount of money?
3831.98s: Notice how I emphasize the point of consistently.
3835.46s: That means that somebody coming up and saying that's what I was expecting to see 15%.
3841.66s: The probability of somebody making 15% every single year is very low.
3847.46s: I do a lot better, but almost certainly you're going to have years that don't exceed 15%.
3855.74s: So think of it this way.
3857.78s: If you're a trader and your goal is to have an income generated by this, whatever
3869.46s: this thing is that you're doing in this case trading.
3873.34s: The way that I look at it is the more conservative the number, the higher the probability
3881.46s: that you will be able to hit it is 15% per year doable, absolutely.
3886.70s: That's a very reasonable return target.
3890.10s: But even though it's very reasonable, what's the confidence interval that we're always
3896.46s: able to hit that number?
3898.34s: And you have to that's based on the trader.
3900.18s: It's up to you to decide for yourself.
3902.26s: That will take a look at 15%.
3906.26s: Something like that.
3907.26s: And then we'll take a look at another scenario of like 6%.
3922.02s: So now we have some at least initial starting points.
3926.50s: Maybe now we need to figure out what kind of principle we might need in order to pull
3931.78s: this off.
3932.78s: You can just do a little bit of math on these, but it doesn't matter yet and I'll show you
3936.78s: why.
3937.78s: We're going to try to apply this methodology of using the single stock.
3941.86s: So essentially we need to look at Nvidia and we just need to see how many puts in calls
3950.30s: would we have to sell in order to make this $10,000 and that's how we're going to back
3954.14s: into how much money we might need.
3957.22s: So let's take a look at the call side of the equation because it looks like that's what
3960.42s: they're talking about starting with.
3961.82s: We'll start with 59 DTE calls.
3963.74s: This will just be a little more advantageous to them.
3966.82s: And let's figure out, let's look at like a 30 delta, which is a common number for the
3973.26s: shorts.
3974.26s: You're going to get like $5.27.
3979.94s: As we know, based on this, oops, wrong spot.
3984.94s: $5.27.
3989.94s: This is a 30 delta strike price is 166.
4001.22s: So we can just assume that we're buying it at spot price.
4005.86s: So we'll figure that out in a second.
4008.38s: Let's say the perspective entry date should be 22 oct.
4016.66s: The stock price is 14330.
4020.70s: Exploration where looking at is 20 D's 24.
4024.30s: And now we essentially need to say how many of these we have to sell in order to get NK.
4029.58s: And you're going to have to sell something around 20.
4034.86s: So now going back to the original part of this equation, which is what they also mentioned,
4044.86s: was cell calls on a portion of the position.
4048.02s: So that means that we would have to have more shares than this.
4055.86s: So we already have at least a loose idea of what kind of size we're going to need.
4060.54s: We're going to need, well, we can think about it.
4065.14s: So we know that we need at least your 20 lot covered.
4075.82s: And then we might say that we want at least another five lot available to us.
4084.82s: That gives us 25,000 shares,
4091.82s: multiply by spot price.
4096.82s: That means for this example,
4101.82s: we need $3.582 million.
4108.82s: It's not to say that it's not doable.
4110.82s: Let's just take a look at it.
4111.82s: So this trade gets 3582500.
4119.82s: And for this scenario, we're going to say on 22.04.
4126.82s: We're going to buy to open 25,000 at 143.3.
4133.82s: So that's our starting position.
4136.82s: We have five contracts uncovered.
4138.82s: This is the part nobody likes to look at.
4140.82s: This is the fucking reality of what these kinds of ideas necessitate.
4146.82s: So you already see the issue here.
4151.82s: So now I'm just going to fast forward.
4154.82s: Far because we know it's much lower now.
4157.82s: Let's just say that you made your $10,000 on that.
4160.82s: We'll just pretend that you got one or two cycles in whatever it doesn't.
4163.82s: It really doesn't matter.
4164.82s: I just want to show this broader point.
4166.82s: So right now, we know that we have 25,000 shares at $143.30.
4174.82s: That original cost is $3.582 million.
4181.82s: So now I'm fast forwarding to 24 March.
4186.82s: And let's see.
4192.82s: Right now in video is at 121.
4196.82s: So let's go back out the 53 days.
4200.82s: Our base is 143.
4202.82s: So we know that we need to sell something above this above a 15 delta.
4207.82s: So like add a 15 delta.
4210.82s: So let's just take a look at what this can get us.
4213.82s: So I'm going to fill this in comparatively so that entry date here would be 24 March.
4219.82s: The stocked entry is 121.89.
4222.82s: Exploration is going to be 16 May.
4225.82s: Should I price on these is 145.
4229.82s: Delta is going to be a 15 delta premium.
4232.82s: You're going to get a $36.5.
4237.82s: So the max of those you can sell is 25.
4241.82s: What do you notice?
4244.82s: You can just get rid of this.
4245.82s: This part doesn't matter.
4249.82s: You got $3,400.
4255.82s: You're three times off.
4257.82s: You're a third at what you need in order for your monthly income.
4262.82s: And that's using again, 3.8 or 3.5 million dollars to start.
4268.82s: That's the problem with these kinds of ideas.
4270.82s: You have to have a much more robust approach than this.
4274.82s: Because this is going to fall on its face.
4277.82s: And it really foregoes the most important part about when you're trying to trade as your primary income source.
4283.82s: Which is reliability.
4284.82s: It is your ability to consistently make the money.
4289.82s: This is why I'm a huge advocate of lowering return targets, but trying to grow your money more so that you can more reasonably and reliably hit the target.
4301.82s: Again, even that 15% return target, the overwhelming probability is for most traders.
4307.82s: You're not going to really hit that every single year.
4310.82s: Now, this goes into a slew of other things that I talk about with respect to trading for a living, which is you should never be trading the year you need in order to make the money that you need for this year.
4323.82s: Meaning, and people think of it even on a monthly basis.
4326.82s: Like if I collect that credit this month, that's what I'm going to spend this month.
4329.82s: It's a terrible approach.
4331.82s: What I think about is literally saving up at the very least two years, preferably three plus years, so that you're literally just refilling multiple years.
4339.82s: In case you have a slow period.
4343.82s: Latup says in this example, aren't we assuming that we're trying to make the 10K in a single trade?
4350.82s: Yes, that's correct.
4353.82s: That's their premise.
4355.82s: So their premise is they're going to sell covered calls on a position to generate income, and then they're going to manage it as such.
4363.82s: That kind of thing.
4368.82s: Shazad says, but if the return target is low, why not just put it in an index fund or dividend yield paying fund? It's a great question.
4375.82s: And it's for a few different reasons. Let's take a look.
4383.82s: The first reason is if I were to put this in a low cost index fund, let's take a look. Let's go.
4393.82s: Last 10 years will do monthly.
4398.82s: Actually, we'll do it annually.
4402.82s: This is why you didn't get any money this year.
4407.82s: You didn't even make it back this year.
4410.82s: You didn't get any money this year.
4412.82s: You didn't get a lot of money this year.
4415.82s: So the whole point I'm making is you are essentially slave to whatever the performance happens to be for the index.
4424.82s: And there are periods where the index does not perform well.
4427.82s: So that's the first reason.
4429.82s: The second reason is you absolutely have the ability then you can make your specific return target.
4439.82s: But then there's nothing that says you don't perform beyond that.
4442.82s: I've mentioned this a bunch of times. Like my return targets have been lowered for the past two years at least I think,
4448.82s: where I used to target at a minimum 15% per year and then I lowered it to eight and then even lower than eight.
4455.82s: But the last three years,
4459.82s: Funny enough, the last two have been some of my most profitable years to date.
4464.82s: So it doesn't mean that you just hit that target and then stop.
4469.82s: Just means that's what you have to hit in order to stay to plan.
4473.82s: And if you trade via just buy and hold an index ETF or index fund, you're going to have you didn't get it.
4481.82s: Not getting it so far this year.
4483.82s: You didn't meet mission in 2022.
4486.82s: You didn't meet mission in 2018.
4488.82s: You didn't meet mission in 15.
4489.82s: You didn't meet mission in 11.
4491.82s: Nor did you meet mission in 08.
4494.82s: And more importantly for some of these periods,
4496.82s: you didn't get back to break even.
4498.82s: So for example,
4499.82s: and oh wait, you didn't get back to break even until 13.
4503.82s: And then for 22, you didn't get back to break even until 24.
4508.82s: That's why.
4509.82s: So it is everything to do with return path.
4512.82s: It's a great question, but that's exactly why.
4515.82s: And a dividend paying fund, they're not going to, they're going to pay what rates were.
4520.82s: People are way too spoiled with the rates that you see this year last year.
4526.82s: There's a long duration where rates were about zero.
4529.82s: A CD account wouldn't pay you effectively until like you could even go over half a percent.
4535.82s: So there are significant periods where you're not going to get a yield.
4540.82s: Again, this is the point I try to make about robustness.
4544.82s: There are a lot of periods where things don't.
4549.82s: Don't work that typically might work.
4553.82s: But if you're trading for a living, guess what?
4556.82s: You need to be robust.
4559.82s: Because there's nobody coming.
4561.82s: There's nobody coming to give you money.
4563.82s: You have to get it yourself.
4564.82s: So that's why.
4566.82s: In for something like this, I've found it to be way more advantageous to just continue actively trading.
4572.82s: First is just parking it in the XETF.
4575.82s: So you can.
4576.82s: It's not a it's not a terrible strategy, but you suffer that problem that I just showed you.
4582.82s: The other thing to keep in mind that is important to know is by trading,
4587.82s: you can make money off of the assets you have parked into something versus needing to make money off of capital gains.
4596.82s: So even on some of these years like this, where the S&P 500 really didn't move that much.
4602.82s: Even in those years, if you're actively trading even a cover triangle or the wheel or short calls against your stock position,
4611.82s: you can still make something.
4613.82s: Whereas otherwise you just don't get anything or you lose money,
4618.82s: at least in terms of the value.
4619.82s: And then the last thing to pay attention to is the way you actually make the money.
4623.82s: Remember, people skip overall these details because they think about trading for a living from like a hypothetical perspective.
4630.82s: But there's fucking logistics.
4632.82s: Some of the logistics are guess what?
4634.82s: In order to withdraw money, you have to take money out of the account.
4637.82s: How do I do that?
4638.82s: Well, if I have $10 million of spy and I want to take a million dollars out, it means I have to sell a million dollars worth of spy.
4647.82s: And then withdraw that money.
4650.82s: The cool part about trading is if you have $10 million worth of spy,
4653.82s: and you're selling options on both side of the coin taking advantage of different market forces.
4658.82s: And then you decide, okay, well, I just made, let's say $500,000 from the option side of the equation.
4666.82s: Then you only need to pull out $500,000 versus another million or whatever the case is.
4672.82s: So something to keep in mind.
4676.82s: Tonight says, hey, there, do you have any good options books you can recommend?
4679.82s: Yeah, definitely options is a strategic investment.
4682.82s: That's the go to that is absolutely what I would direct your towards.
4689.82s: Shazad says this is just return target.
4692.82s: You also have to determine the amount you're willing to risk as well.
4696.82s: That's like a different side of the equation.
4699.82s: But definitely because if you're thinking about the way to generate money in any sense,
4707.82s: you're going to have to put capital up to do something.
4710.82s: So yeah, definitely.
4712.82s: It's a different side of the equation, but it's an equally important part of the equation,
4717.82s: especially for people again that are trading for income or trading for a living.
4722.82s: So if I'm, for example, trading spy, and I'm just buying and holding the index ETF because that's going to be my income,
4732.82s: well, guess what?
4734.82s: In order to have that million dollars or $10 million worth of exposure, I have to use $10 million.
4741.82s: Whereas if I'm using options, I can sell cash secured puts that have a mobile strike and stuff like that.
4746.82s: Because you're a little more adaptability.
4748.82s: The more important part in my opinion with respect to trading is the ability to do other shit.
4753.82s: Right?
4754.82s: I gave you guys that overview at the beginning of this stream with respect to how the coverage
4758.82s: Strangles are performing for me and my portfolio, which is poorly.
4761.82s: They're doing poorly because the market's doing poorly.
4764.82s: They're long delta strategies.
4766.82s: So the way that I'm making money is by other trading activities.
4769.82s: It's not just being set and stone doing one thing.
4771.82s: That's the beauty of being a trader.
4773.82s: So yeah, you have to be pretty adaptable.
4775.82s: But when you think about the world of trading for a living, it's important to not look at it idealistically,
4780.82s: but to look at it as it is and then figure out how to make it work.
4783.82s: Because it is as beautiful as it sounds.
4786.82s: It really is.
4787.82s: Like the ability to trade and make a primary income source through stuff like this is incredible.
4793.82s: It's stuff that I never even would have thought of before.
4796.82s: And it's life changing.
4798.82s: But if you think of it in the context of, you know, how do I want this to look or what sounds cool to me,
4808.82s: then you're really not building something that's likely to perform very well for you.
4813.82s: So worth keeping that in mind.
4816.82s: Sweet.
4818.82s: All right, gang.
4819.82s: I got a bounce.
4820.82s: Great.
4821.82s: Hang in out.
4822.82s: If you need anything, let your boy know pro live stream tomorrow.
4824.82s: 7000 per second time.
4825.82s: Let's go there.
