0.00s: What's going on with the ape community time for a Jimmy update because somebody sent me
5.74s: this post actually from Superstunk.
8.36s: And this is from Mojo Master 5 and the post says he's back, Keith in the house and speculation
15.94s: slash opinion.
16.94s: So the post here, we'll go through it.
19.36s: And I just want to share my thoughts on what this is, what it looks like.
24.04s: I haven't gone through the whole thing yet.
25.92s: Obviously I can tell from the top here what this is about.
29.80s: And let's see what's going on is roaring kitty getting back into GM E options.
35.88s: That's the assumption I have taking a look at this.
38.08s: So let's get right in.
40.56s: So it says see that yeah, that run beginning around 14 30.
47.48s: So I'm assuming that they're using Eastern time was a block of 5,025 calls for 15
53.76s: of picked up at the offer.
55.84s: So this is assuming that they're buys and a really important note here is when there
62.32s: are the different classifications for the price based on if it's executed closer to
68.32s: the bid or the offer, it's not perfect.
71.32s: In this case, I'm assuming it's representative of them being purchases, but just a general
76.88s: note for people to be aware of because it's not as simple, it's not definitive.
81.12s: You should just know that.
83.20s: Should be our boy decided to make a splash today and triggered a little gamma squeeze action
87.28s: while doing so.
90.08s: Looks like a couple big boys followed in his wake as well.
95.08s: And let's take a look here at this at their screenshot and they're just showing the movements
101.84s: in key.
102.84s: This is the volume for that contract.
105.24s: Now a couple notes specifically with respect to gamma squeeze gamma squeezes are really
111.76s: specific and 5,000 options is just not going to do it.
116.32s: The other thing to keep in mind is if we take a look at game stop here and let's zoom
125.40s: this in just a little bit so that we have kind of your term price action on a really cool
130.96s: note.
132.04s: If you guys remember, I drew this 20 and a half level a long time ago and that was where
138.44s: I was expecting support to be found just based on prior price activity around that level
144.28s: going back a longer term time frame, right going all the way back to here.
150.16s: And the really cool part about this is that it does seem like that might be close to
157.12s: what this new floor might look like for game stop, which would be maybe mid 20s on the
162.56s: lower end, maybe mid 19s, but it looks like it's really respecting this general range,
168.48s: meaning lots of people are buying and selling in here.
170.84s: So for the near term, it doesn't look like it's moving parabolic either direction, but
176.24s: I don't think it's a bad thing because I think it's starting to base out here and have
180.56s: kind of a new generalized value.
183.60s: Now if we take a look at the options in here though, I want to show you a couple things
191.36s: quickly.
193.44s: Looking at the 15 know the 25s, if we see the current delta, there are about a 33 delta
201.08s: as it sits now and the game is like a 0.09.
204.76s: Now the idea of building a gamma ramp actually isn't about individual strikes.
210.84s: A gamma ramp is built over several strikes being ramped up because the way that a gamma
218.76s: ramp will work is as the underlying rallies and options fall in the money, especially
225.68s: as the closer to expiration, market makers who are typically the counterparty would start
230.64s: buying shares to cover the new risk, meaning in case they fall in the money and they have
237.88s: to deliver.
239.56s: Then as they are buying shares, that moves price up a little bit into the next strike.
247.60s: And if there's enough open interest at the next strike that was at the money, they
253.48s: have to start buying more to hedge that risk and then it pushes it to the next strike.
259.68s: And then that's how a gamma ramp is built.
262.36s: So right now there's just not enough depth in these options to actually serve as an actual
267.64s: gamma ramp just for a general understanding about more so how those will perform.
274.12s: So and then the idea of a couple other players following along, it does look like that because
280.60s: the volume today was over 20,000.
283.08s: So this actually popped up on a couple of my scans today just because of the activity
289.56s: pretty drastically exceeding in already high.
293.20s: So yeah, definitely other people moved along.
297.04s: However, if you've watched my other videos on stuff like GameStop, you already know that
303.16s: these kind of more primary explorations as I refer to them as, you're going to tend
308.00s: to see more concentration.
309.72s: So what that means is anything that ends in like a zero or a five will tend to have more volume
316.28s: than things that are in the middle and definitely whole number strikes as compared to half
320.04s: strikes.
321.12s: So if we look at the 20s, there's 4,000 of those.
323.72s: If we look at the 21s, there is 427.
328.56s: And if we look at the 22s, there's 1,500.
331.92s: And you kind of get the point here until we get to the 25s, which even before today had
336.52s: 18,000.
338.12s: And then if we get to the 30s, you can see that had 13,000.
343.28s: So that's just a really natural tendency as people buy options.
349.04s: So again, just a general note for you all.
353.56s: This looks like just some of the other trades that went through.
356.04s: Because these are short dated calls, if he doesn't close this trade right away for a profit
361.04s: which he absolutely could, then he must anticipate something else is coming down the pipe.
364.72s: Maybe it's him.
365.72s: Maybe it's a copycat in any case exercise caution.
368.04s: So I like that they're being objective in their analysis, specifically in turn in terms
373.12s: of maybe it's him.
375.52s: Maybe it's a copycat.
376.52s: I think this is already very presumptive in terms of saying if he doesn't, because again,
381.16s: we have no idea.
382.16s: Now, I want to talk about a few things.
384.08s: The very first thing I want to show you are some of Roin Kitty's habits.
388.56s: And if you're unfamiliar, I've been doing a live stream every Saturday for like the
393.12s: last what three months, four months now.
397.40s: And we've spent at least two of those months analyzing every single trade that he's made
403.16s: and going through one by one.
406.16s: Now there's a couple of really high level tendencies that I've been able to pick up looking
411.76s: at his stuff.
413.20s: The first thing is if I take a look at the various days to expiration that he tends to
419.68s: get in at the overwhelming majority have entries that are much longer days to expiration.
429.88s: That's actually what this is here.
431.28s: It's tracking the actual days to expiration for his entries.
435.36s: The shortest was a three DTE trade.
437.76s: I literally could see it.
440.20s: This was back in 2020 and it was a very specific trade that was wrapped around a thesis he had
446.44s: around a console release and the impact around earnings.
450.96s: So this was the only the only circumstance that I've seen anything shorter than a month
458.48s: for him.
459.68s: Now that being said, there was a circumstance here where in April, it did look like
467.88s: there was some activity that appeared to be him, but we have no idea because he didn't
476.32s: post any sort of yellow updates, nothing like that.
478.96s: And these were actually slightly shorter term options, but still not super short.
484.56s: So the main thing I want to highlight is that if this is him, it would be very, very
490.56s: contrary to his standard positioning at all, meaning just days to expiration selection
498.92s: would be quite novel in this case.
501.68s: Now as far as delta selection, I think that's about right.
505.76s: So he does 10 towards the slightly out of the monies.
510.40s: So this looks fine.
513.20s: The main thing I see here is just way too short in duration.
516.64s: Now if we go to unusual whales and we take a look at this, there's
520.56s: a couple other notes that I want to highlight.
522.80s: The first one is that again, if this were him, this is still a very small position for
528.04s: him.
529.04s: So through and 50,000 dollars, again, for most mortals, that's a ton of money, but for
534.48s: him, if you're trading several hundred million dollar account, it's tiny.
539.32s: And I would be really surprised.
541.44s: The other thing is I don't think this is him phasing into a position because going back
546.92s: to that, we tend to see multiple entries on his prior quote unquote phasing in of
553.28s: positions that then hits a crux that he sizes in more aggressively.
558.56s: Now this is using the 21 June 20 calls that he was getting into about a month out in
564.08s: 20 May.
565.52s: This ended up being a massive position.
567.72s: So this was scaled in over several days.
571.28s: If he was trading a really short term idea, he doesn't have this much time to scale
575.96s: in like this.
577.16s: So I would actually expect him to size in much more heavily up front if I thought that
583.48s: that was him, which again, I'm a little dubious of it.
589.84s: And in short, this just doesn't look like his activity.
594.60s: Now there are things that do match though.
598.00s: The strike selection absolutely does the 5,000 lot size certainly does.
601.88s: But again, it's always important to remember, he doesn't have any sort of hold of 5,000
608.88s: lots, right?
609.96s: Other people transact in 5,000 lots.
612.40s: The position size is a little bit small.
614.52s: The timing is about right because as we went through all of his old trades here, I definitely
620.24s: noticed a lot of towards end of day entries as well as beginning of day.
625.36s: First hour was pretty common for some of his other positions and definitely towards this
630.56s: is specific time.
631.96s: Towards the end of the day is very common.
633.72s: The majority of the trades were done a little bit later in the day.
638.20s: So that fits as well.
640.00s: In general, it looks like a slightly mixed bag.
643.04s: I lean towards this doesn't look like him.
646.16s: If you have an opinion, let me know in the comments.
648.20s: If you think this is him or not, be an outlier, be an ape.
650.64s: I'll see you guys later.
