0.00s:  What up ape outliers? It's kind of a specific class of us, I suppose.
6.00s:  I kind of grabbed my dog because he ran over and I thought he wanted to say.
17.00s:  Here's the mascot. He's here ready to rock and roll. So he and I, we were reading a couple studies.
24.00s:  We got some feedback. So we were reading a couple studies recently about
31.00s:  GME and the off exchange routing volume and decisions.
39.00s:  So I want to spend a little bit of time taking a look at that with you guys today.
43.00s:  He gave me a bunch of good things to pay attention to.
46.00s:  So I thought we would start there. And then I want to take a look at Rory and Kitty's old trades.
53.00s:  And then specifically the options and how he set them up. I'm trying to develop more of like a fingerprint as I like to call it.
61.00s:  Of his behavior. Do you like mango?
66.00s:  Do you like mango?
68.00s:  I guess.
69.00s:  Seems like yes. All right. So the or likes mango is what I've recently learned.
74.00s:  And then. And then yeah, I want to talk a little bit about the recent price behavior behavior.
80.00s:  And.
83.00s:  We're back at it. Just a technical difficulty real quick.
89.00s:  And yeah, so then for the rest of the stream or anything like that.
95.00s:  If there's anything that you guys want to take a look at, just let me know.
99.00s:  And we will we will go left go right go whichever direction you all want to take this stuff.
106.00s:  I need to I think turn to volume.
109.00s:  How's the volume for you guys? Is it coming through? Okay.
113.00s:  I was thinking I might need to raise it just a little bit.
117.00s:  I can't tell.
118.00s:  All right. Let me grab this chat.
122.00s:  Just instead of if there's time could you take a look at Rory and Kitty's charts? Yeah. Of course.
127.00s:  So.
129.00s:  Lasidio says it's good. Zach says good. Justin says good. That is three greens for go.
136.00s:  Means we're in rock roll. All right. Cool.
138.00s:  So I'm moving the child over here so I can keep an eyeball on everybody. And as always, I like to say hello to whoever's hanging out.
145.00s:  So we got said trick, which is a hell of a name. Zach.
149.00s:  The crowd favorite roaring titty. Always my favorite.
153.00s:  It looks like Ryan Cohen tweeted again. So let's take a quick look at X.
163.00s:  And let's see what our boys up to.
167.00s:  Ryan.
169.00s:  Oh, and.
174.00s:  All right.
177.00s:  So we're working with here.
180.00s:  Kamala.
183.00s:  That's.
192.00s:  That's so funny.
195.00s:  The dude is just having a good time. You got it. Like I don't know. I love him for it because if I think you guys are the ones that told me that he.
203.00s:  I'm pretty sure you guys told me that he's fucking Canadian. So I don't even think he could vote.
208.00s:  So the fact that he's playing all these games is obviously just he's just messing around.
216.00s:  Which I'm I am completely here for.
221.00s:  All right.
224.00s:  So it looks like the tweet that we have here is a Kamala Grande iced mocha with almond milk cookie crumbles.
234.00s:  And then the Trump 2024 is the Grande iced Americano. And that's it.
241.00s:  Polaris big fan.
243.00s:  Zach says I love that a CEO can just be politically incorrect.
247.00s:  So the funny part about that I think honestly is the fact that I think especially in general people are starting to get a little bit tired of how it feels like there's a lot of landmines with respect to speech.
261.00s:  Like if you say something you say something the wrong way that all of a sudden there's a bunch of problems and it's kind of just like backwards in my opinion of the some of the ideas of free speech, which is if you say something that's fucked up.
275.00s:  People have the right to not like you and that's that like that's it's a completely viable agreement.
284.00s:  In case you guys don't know.
286.00s:  I'm a Celterwater kind of sore and today I'm indulging one of my favorites, which is these are literally from Iceland.
295.00s:  This is a Mexican lime crystal. I like it. It sounds like a stripper some sort of stripper beverage, but it's literally just a seltzer water and it's like the best seltzer water I think ever.
308.00s:  Hey, there's a hundred of us in here shout out to you guys shout out to the ape outliers.
314.00s:  Listen to you says it's green. We can't see it. I don't have a green screen. So I'm wearing green.
320.00s:  That's interesting. So the silver part comes through.
324.00s:  What if I put my hand behind it? That works.
329.00s:  Huh, check that out.
333.00s:  That's kind of nuts that I can just zoom in. And then if I put it in front of my face, can you see my face through it or no? No.
340.00s:  It kind of blocks it all out.
343.00s:  Not a technical guy. As you can tell, I am about as simple as you all are and I was just very interested in how that worked.
353.00s:  But I'm going to enjoy my crystal all the way from Iceland.
359.00s:  All right. So let's let's dig in, shall we?
367.00s:  I mean, the trick says, can you see my face through it? Yeah. I mean, these are the these are the questions that I have.
372.00s:  Like I said, I'm a simple man. I like simple things.
376.00s:  All right, let's kill this down. And what do you guys want to do? Do you want to start with looking at GameStop as it sits today?
382.00s:  Or do you want to start going through some of the nerd stuff that I was looking at before?
387.00s:  Whatever sounds better to you sounds good to me.
391.00s:  And like I said, the other thing I want to take a look at is some of Roaring Kiddy's old positions.
395.00s:  And I think one of you said that you wanted to take a look at his charts.
398.00s:  So completely up to you guys.
401.00s:  Wherever you want to start is where I would like to start.
405.00s:  Dom D says Eric will chew. We have to file a 13 G when he sells. Yeah.
411.00s:  So he will have to provide an update to it.
417.00s:  So if you take a look at the 13 G filing procedures and again, I want to be very, very specific.
425.00s:  This is not my strength area. This is typically your guys' strength area over mine.
431.00s:  But I've spent time looking at it out of curiosity for this event.
436.00s:  So the initial filing passive investors, they have to not file initially within five business days of acquiring more than five percent beneficial ownership.
446.00s:  Qualified institutional investors, they can do it within 45 days at the end of the year once they cross the 5% threshold.
454.00s:  Amendments must be filed within 45 days after the calendar quarter in which a material change occurs.
464.00s:  So that's what that looks like.
472.00s:  Nerd stuff cool. Let's take a look at some nerd stuff.
478.00s:  There's two studies that I think are relevant to us.
483.00s:  And what I wanted to do is there's a lot of conversation about the off exchange volume about the dark pool volume about the impact that it has on price discovery.
494.00s:  So I started going down a little bit of a rabbit hole.
497.00s:  There's some general context. I am a trader.
500.00s:  So the routing of orders in general is not a massive focus for me because it eventually hits the market.
508.00s:  Now from the GME side of things, I fully understand if there's some sort of speculation on the impact, especially on lower float stocks.
521.00s:  So I wanted to go and understand that more.
524.00s:  So I found a few studies that talk a little bit more about routing order volume off exchange so that I could get smarter about it.
533.00s:  So I thought we could look through these together.
536.00s:  Alfonso says I think that 13G requires an amendment only if a beneficial understake falls below 5% or the change in ownership amounts to 1% more of the obscenities.
545.00s:  Yeah, I think I think that sounds right based on what I was looking at before.
551.00s:  So I think same plan or same same page.
556.00s:  So talking about this dark pool order routing for those that don't know the origin of dark pool order routing is really.
568.00s:  It's not all bad now there are bad components to it in that it does obscure price discovery it absolutely does and that's the part I don't like about it.
580.00s:  Now the reason why it exists is because honestly traders like me and even smarter traders traders that have high frequency systems.
591.00s:  Those kinds of entities will hunt for what looks like big building positions in front run it.
600.00s:  So here's what that generally looks like we can look at it on a chart probably not one that's just collapsing down just for general again general understanding.
612.00s:  When we see something like this again I'm not saying that this is all some sort of insider trading or institutional I'm just using it as an example but let's just say that this volume being built up is coming from institutions in this example.
632.00s:  That's happening and again traders like me that are looking for these kinds of things start to see this and we know at that point an institution is building a position there's a few things I know as a trader they can't get a fill all at once it's near impossible.
647.00s:  I also know that they typically are going to build out their fills over several days several periods of time.
654.00s:  So it gives me an opportunity to front run the move so if I see volume expanding like this and I see a massive by volume expansion like this I'll start building a position by buying shares buying options specifically calls.
669.00s:  And it allows me to participate however as I'm doing that that's also driving price up demand is still increasing both from the original entity that's trying to put on a really large trade and small fish like me that are front running it but then you also have really smart systems like high frequency trading systems that are literally hunting for changes in volume like this they're based on very quick reacting algorithms.
697.00s:  So what that eventually does is as soon as people like me and other entities see this kind of buying volume we make it more expensive for that entity to get a fill to actually establish their position and again that's the nature of markets do I feel bad about it fuck no they can go fuck themselves but I also understand the problem that it presents to them and why they would look for a solution because that is a problem if you're trying to put on a 40 billion dollar position for not even a hundred percent.
726.00s:  For not even it's not even have to be half of that be like 50 million dollars we don't have to talk about billions we could talk millions and if we're in the millions it still is going to meaningfully move the price observably enough that a bunch of other people want to profit off that same movement because of that known force.
747.00s:  So it creates an opportunity so dark pools.
753.00s:  Just says how do you sleep at night honestly before I had this bullshit with my sciatic nerve I slept just fine as a lately not super great but it's not to do it is obviously.
766.00s:  But so dark pools they originated so that big orders could get put through at a certain size in your transactions so that the orders weren't being front ran continually that's the good side of dark pools again one of the things I try to remind you guys is that you will very rarely find me on a polar position.
796.00s:  Because I've spent my entire life trying to be able to analyze things from a midpoint I still will lean towards a certain opinion but even something like dark pools which generally has a really negative undertone to it which I don't disagree with there are still net positives within it now in terms of whether it's an aggregate net positive I don't think so because again like whether or not a big institution can get a clean fill I really don't care.
824.00s:  I think they should be participating for price discovery just as I should however I also do understand and I can analyze it from their perspective because that would be really annoying after a while without a doubt it would be very very frustrating.
840.00s:  So that's kind of the good side now the bad side is because of the way that dark pool orders are routed it then does not help with current state price discovery.
854.00s:  Justin says I meant how do you sleep at night after doing the evil things like making money off of these situations oh yeah I know what you meant just a little I was just kind of playing along with you yeah.
865.00s:  So the papers that I want to look at with you all are these and I haven't read through these fully yet there was a bunch of them that I shared with Newton to include on his absolutely massive gm e.
882.00s:  Google sheet which if you guys are not familiar with it I think you need to grab this.
892.00s:  So this is a link to yeah so that's a link to the gm e to the gm e Google sheet that he maintains which is just it's one of the best repositories of information that I could conceivably come across.
908.00s:  So when I look at this there's a ton of great data one of the things that I wanted to dump in here is a bunch of stuff about this order routing so I thought we could start by looking through this.
924.00s:  Zach says he's got a bounce if you have time later in the stream would love to look at chuey 5000 block calls purchase prior to the RK's six 24 share purchase yeah we can take a look at that let's take a look at that real quick.
940.00s:  This will be the easier tool for us to do that with let's do chuey and then you said before the six 24 share purchase.
956.00s:  So then there's six 24 so then I think we did this before and then let's see this is calls inputs let's do just calls let's do just at the offer and then let's sort by size.
978.00s:  I literally don't see any 5000 blocks see zero of them maybe we'll go back further we'll do like may to 21 June yeah so Zach I see zero of those I see one 10,000 block which was massive.
1003.00s:  And that was at the 27 but still these were pretty far out of the money at the time so it was a relatively cheap trade so Zach whenever you're checking out the recording I literally don't see any of those.
1021.00s:  Because I think people asked me to look at this before there were blocks of 500 and this is actually one of the things I wanted to do with you all is go back at some of his older positions because the way that he builds his options positions is again like this is one of the reasons why this is so fascinating to me is that this is literally like it's like it's a big puzzle with a world that I'm infatuated by I love.
1051.00s:  Markets I love markets it's what I do so the fact that there's this big puzzle in here is just really really interesting to me Anthony says it's hardest they positive what a shitty day no you can't feel like that man.
1066.00s:  The way that I would look at stuff like today depending on what really comes down to like what the thesis is and what you're trying to do and I think one of the big things that I find people in the community do is I don't know why you'll do it to yourselves you guys like set yourselves up for this really really tough emotional roller coaster where we try to you know speculate on a specific date for a specific movement to happen like those kinds of things and it to me I
1096.00s:  would also become exhausted after a while trying to maintain that so when I look at something like GameStop today maybe we'll talk about this for a second then we'll get into the nerd stuff because I do want to address that this is not bad it's going down shit goes down sometimes but if you take a look literally at where it's at now literally from middle of April until today it is over double where it was.
1125.00s:  That's not bad again I know a lot of people are really really clinging on for this really big squeeze for Mo as which I'm still learning more about in context of what that actually means for people but I wouldn't get disenfranchised when you see something going down it's part of general natural price movement.
1144.00s:  And you can also see that there's tons of people that are still at the point of control here so that means that a lot of people like transacting even at higher prices so I wouldn't view this as terrible I wouldn't view this is great like obviously I don't want it to go down either I have a position on in here but it also doesn't mean anything to me necessarily because the stock is going to do whatever it's going to do so if I get
1173.00s:  too emotionally wrapped up in the movement of lines on a chart that puts me in just a compromised mental and emotional state that I'm literally handing control over my emotions to something I have no control over I cannot pick where GM Egos so I'm not going to base how I feel on something that I can't control when I think about something.
1201.00s:  Anthony says are you blind or something this is bad fool again context right when I look at something like this that on nine on 16 April was at 995 and then I look at it even after it's down for you know essentially two weeks straight even after it's down for two weeks straight it's still over $20 it's still double plus
1231.00s:  where it was a few months ago stocks can try to make this kind of move from 995 to 21 they do that in like five years it takes forever so yeah it absolutely again it's all context based Anthony says technicals are bad I don't disagree with you like right now it is absolutely pulling back there's no doubt stocks do that
1261.00s:  find me a stock that doesn't do that there this isn't this isn't a thing right so if I look at Tesla a company that is done insanely well and let's take a look at a different context it still hasn't gotten back up to where it was last September right like stocks go multiple directions this is completely completely normal
1290.00s:  so for something like game stop to be going through a pullback it's like of course this is normal what what stock doesn't do this so again to me you have a choice right you can view it as this terribly negative awful scenario and I mean you're welcome to do that to me the argument I kind of offer to you is that your emotional attachment to it literally does nothing for the stock it's not going to make the stock go up
1320.00s:  so the only thing you're doing is getting yourself wound up over something you have zero control over which to me is it just
1330.08s:  a grigious waste of time and energy
1335.20s:  the way that I would look at it if I was like really really really wanting you know game stop to go up I know a lot of people they have this is like a massive part of like the retirement plans and shit like that
1349.04s:  if that was my scenario I would literally just pick points at where I like it and then DC a dollar cost average that's if I really like it
1360.08s:  but if you feel weird about it just you don't have to do anything with your position you can always scale your position down there's a million ways that you can play something like this the other thing I would offer to you
1372.56s:  that I think you might want to hear although it's uncomfortable is that one of the best one of the one of the like the transformative things I've done as a trader
1384.24s:  I've been doing this since 2007 I haven't always been this composed I haven't always had this disposition towards markets because it takes time to develop the way you feel about things
1395.68s:  but when I look at something like this the way I would be thinking about it if I was like a true all in on game stop trader which again I'm I keep it a buck with you guys
1408.32s:  GameStop is part of my portfolio. I'm a trader but it's not it's not I don't have all my chips on GameStop
1414.64s:  but for the p I know people do and for the people that do I would think of it from the context of before you finish pushing all of your chips onto
1425.92s:  think through the life cycle of the product think how it can behave and think how you will feel how you will react and then create a plan
1436.96s:  that plan is literally what will sustain you during times when things are not going really well
1444.64s:  a similar example not exactly on same topic spx
1450.08s:  So for those that don't know I trade spx a lot with different kinds of structures in a big thing
1456.32s:  I do are zero dte options and there's a lot of other reasons why I use zero dte options most of you don't care
1466.00s:  and I'm not going to bore you with it just the context zero dte means options that expire the same day it means that there's a lot of them
1475.44s:  When you're trading that kind of strategy you can go through pro long periods where you lose money
1482.48s:  You can lose five days in row six days in row seven days in a row eight days in a row
1488.24s:  And during those periods you kind of start asking yourself you're like shit
1492.64s:  Did I get this right? Is there a problem here? Should I do something else? I don't like losing this much
1499.44s:  But
1500.64s:  What sustains me through those periods and something like this is I've done a
1506.08s:  On of research on what I'm doing
1509.68s:  And I know there's a process called path dependence
1514.40s:  What that means is every once in a while you're going to have an ugly or beneficial path
1520.16s:  Where things happen to work in your favor or work against your favor
1525.04s:  But if you are comfortable with the broader plan and you're like yeah, okay
1530.24s:  Losing eight days in a row is not my favorite wouldn't pick it
1533.84s:  But I know that this is all part of a bigger system that in the aggregate works out
1539.36s:  We will find a good path and take like this is a great example from the 12th of April
1545.84s:  To the 19th of April
1547.60s:  They're all consecutive down days like that's not a great path
1551.68s:  But then if you go over here to the first of July
1556.16s:  Up until the 10th of July even though this was a down day that's still a cure uptrend this was a down day on a gap up
1564.00s:  So that's a happy path
1566.00s:  There's going to be happy path there's going to be sad path
1569.12s:  But what I try to encourage people to think about is not attaching happier sad by just thinking about the path of returns as they are
1577.52s:  Things go up things go down
1579.92s:  If you think of it in this context it's been going down pretty solidly
1583.92s:  Since the 17th of July if you take a look at where it was at here on the second of May
1589.68s:  It essentially didn't get a down tick
1592.08s:  Until the 14th of May and these are massive up moves look at the difference in context
1597.92s:  so
1599.12s:  I would just encourage
1600.80s:  People that feel that way to reconfigure the the emotional relationship with the market
1606.08s:  Because
1608.08s:  Because what I can tell you is that if this kind of movement here makes you feel some type of way
1613.04s:  This is going to be a tough business whether you use GameStop or another product
1616.88s:  If something literally goes from 28 to 22 and that's causing like indigestion
1623.92s:  Then I mean one that tells me you probably need to size your position down
1628.96s:  That's one of the easiest ways to not care as much about stuff that's not going well
1633.04s:  But then you have to be prepared to kick yourself because you're going to be pissed off
1636.88s:  When the thing goes up to 45 in the course of three days and you have a small position on
1643.04s:  You can't you can't have it both ways
1645.68s:  And you have to decide what matters to you most are you trying to make sure that you can stay into this for the long run and minimize the downside the drawdowns
1653.60s:  That's okay. You can do that
1655.12s:  But then
1656.40s:  There's going to be an up move at some point and you're not probably going to have the position size
1661.28s:  You would want for that
1662.72s:  So as long as you can reconcile those two things and you're good
1667.12s:  All right little bit of a rant but I
1670.56s:  I
1670.88s:  One of the things I think a lot about with respect to trading is just how important the psychological component is to this
1678.16s:  We all have access to the same stuff
1680.40s:  So the reason why some people are successful and other people aren't it's not because they have access to better tools
1687.20s:  And it definitely is really nothing to do with once you have a base level of intelligence
1692.24s:  It's not because you're smarter. I'm not that smart
1695.12s:  So once you have a general understanding of things
1698.96s:  Then it really comes down to how well you can handle yourself as a trader which takes time to figure out
1706.80s:  so
1707.76s:  My hope is for people that are trading this kind of thing that they can develop a healthy relationship with it
1713.84s:  So that it doesn't cost stress so that you can kind of play the moves as they come as you feel comfortable and take advantage of the opportunities where they are
1721.92s:  That's what I think
1724.32s:  All right, so let me get caught up on some of the chat here
1729.36s:  Um, Viablo says patience people. Yeah, I think that that's right. I think that's that that's absolutely right
1737.76s:  Um
1739.12s:  Money things says gme is 99% of my portfolio the other one percent is split up between 30 other stocks
1745.52s:  That's hilarious
1746.96s:  Yeah, and I know a lot of people like to go really gme heavy and that's
1751.28s:  Absolutely cool like whatever makes sense for you as a trader is what matters again
1755.44s:  It's not what I would do. It's not what I'm doing. I wouldn't put that much money into something like gme
1761.04s:  But it's because I always classify myself as an overly conservative investor
1766.56s:  That's one of the reasons why I'm so infatuated with roaring kitty is because he has literally a different constitution
1776.08s:  Not even to be essentially in one individual product that is whatever I've been hyper concentrated too
1783.12s:  But the fact that this dude can look at a position
1786.80s:  That's up $175 million and just hold it
1794.32s:  I mean
1795.52s:  That is
1797.12s:  What they again, I've told you guys is before what it literally tells me is that this is not about money
1801.84s:  That's that's literally what that tells me
1804.64s:  He was at a point in this trade here that he essentially could have conducted a cashless exercise on this entire position
1812.48s:  If he wanted he had essentially enough money at this point to do that just about and
1820.16s:  The fact that he just held it and just let it go
1824.24s:  Like that tells me that there is a different motivation. There's a different focus a different incentive
1830.00s:  Which is absolutely fascinating to me because
1834.24s:  Most people if you think of it in terms of like game theory
1837.52s:  You can kind of war game what the motivations are and why we're doing things a certain way
1842.56s:  And then you see this and you're like yo
1845.60s:  This doesn't align with any of that
1848.88s:  This is a dude that is straight up up
1853.04s:  $250 million dollars
1856.64s:  And just hold in this shit
1860.48s:  Like
1861.52s:  Like it's nuts
1864.32s:  So one of the really cool things about that I think is it just offers another perspective that there's a lot of different things
1872.32s:  people
1873.36s:  Want and try to accomplish in markets
1876.80s:  And I mean this is just
1879.12s:  Absolutely incredible to see
1882.00s:  So
1882.88s:  When it come you know going all the way back to this idea of like setting up a portfolio you just have to figure out what's right for you
1888.24s:  And in roaring kiddie's video himself. He's like this is a true yellow and the dude has no problem doing that stuff
1894.08s:  Which is again very very cool. I think it's fascinating to learn about
1897.92s:  So the punchline on that is you got to set things up in a way that makes sense for you
1903.52s:  That's the
1904.72s:  That's really what it boils down to because for me I've made it clear a big part of my motivation for trading was
1912.56s:  I grew up with a single mom didn't have sheep she had like no money
1916.72s:  She worked two jobs the job that she spent most of her time working she was an occupational therapist for mentally disabled kids kids that literally are retarded
1925.84s:  and
1927.04s:  She doesn't have a retirement so I started trading because I knew
1933.20s:  She had no retirement that I was going to be the retirement
1936.48s:  So for me I can't there's no room for yellow
1940.00s:  Because the way that I trade is
1943.28s:  Originally was to build money one so that I could change my lot in life to be clear
1948.32s:  There's also a selfish portion to it as well. I didn't want to live like that
1953.12s:  But it's because I knew the only way she was going to retire is if
1957.92s:  Me or my brother were in a position to help her and my brother works really hard
1961.52s:  But he does things differently than I do so I kind of knew that I was going to be a big part of this
1966.08s:  So all of that goes back. I don't share any of that as like a sob story
1970.00s:  I'm very happy with my background
1972.00s:  But it's so that people understand my context
1974.48s:  That's why when you hear me say things like I don't really believe in yellows
1978.88s:  It's that's the subtext that's not to say I don't believe in yellows for anybody you got to do. It's right for you
1984.08s:  It's just slightly slightly different
1987.36s:  then
1989.44s:  Yeah, then I think
1992.32s:  Other people may or may not approach it from
1995.52s:  so
1997.68s:  Back over now to the nerd stuff
2001.76s:  Kind of a fun philosophical conversation. I enjoyed that
2007.44s:  All right, let's see
2008.96s:  So this paper is a little bit old and it's called the off exchange routing decision
2014.48s:  You guys can all download this for yourself off of SSR N
2018.40s:  I do this on purpose and the reason why I do this is so that you all
2024.40s:  Can
2025.36s:  gain access to the same information that I'm looking at you should always be able to repeat
2032.88s:  Data that you see if the data is not repeatable
2036.80s:  Then there's a problem. So this is looking at over the counter market specifically
2043.36s:  So there's it that's just an important context here
2047.68s:  So it says a rising fraction of us x2d trading volume is being executed away from the national stock exchanges
2053.76s:  And on the over the counter market. So it develops the theoretical model of the decision to route exchange volume off
2064.40s:  To an a ts platform
2067.12s:  and then it uses
2070.40s:  Finra data to compute weekly time series of market shares for non for
2076.32s:  OTC non a ts trading centers
2079.44s:  Looking at the individual stock level from 2016 April
2083.92s:  To 30 June 2018
2087.28s:  So let's take a look we don't have to read through all of the specifics in here unless you know you guys really want to
2093.44s:  I'm always down for that
2095.44s:  But it looks at essentially what is this like over 2000
2099.68s:  2000 stocks it looks at a really really broad basket of things
2104.32s:  So here we see the average trade of off exchange executions and our sample
2110.72s:  Shows that only 0.1% of a ts transactions are 10,000 shares or more the traditional block size
2117.60s:  A block trade size
2119.68s:  Notes that only 2.53 of the trades through tc non
2124.40s:  A ts dealers are block size both off exchange markets have small trade sizes even though the majority of trading is institutional
2131.44s:  This I think is really interesting
2134.16s:  Because
2135.68s:  The reason why I find this to be interesting is that it starts to kind of counter some of that broader narrative
2141.04s:  Around why we route off exchange
2145.12s:  So let's kind of skip through some of this stuff
2147.84s:  I want to we'll start actually with the results and then we'll kind of work back up into any questions that we have
2153.36s:  And really what I'm doing is I'm setting the table to work through this with you all
2157.52s:  You guys aren't familiar with this website. I'm not affiliated with them at all
2161.76s:  But they have a really cool simplified tool to track off exchange volume
2166.96s:  For different tickers and I wanted to work through this with you guys for a few reasons
2171.92s:  And the reason being is because the routing of orders off exchange isn't
2178.00s:  Probably as crazy as you guys might think it is
2182.00s:  But there are some really important commonalities that I think we need to be able to talk about
2188.08s:  Because for example
2190.40s:  When we look at this kind of movement here
2194.08s:  Right
2195.12s:  This is a massive this is when we saw that squeeze
2199.52s:  In 14 May and during that squeeze take a look at off exchange volume
2204.00s:  Applements right so we know that this happens this is well
2207.60s:  I think you guys know this right. I don't think that this is groundbreaking news for anybody
2212.24s:  When we start to see certain behaviors in the underlying price we know
2217.44s:  Historically that it moves the market makers and other entities to off exchange solutions
2225.60s:  Cedric says dark pools are normal
2227.28s:  But so is naked short selling besides when it was invented
2230.40s:  Yeah, well the interesting thing about naked short selling again
2233.44s:  It's similar to dark pools in that I don't believe naked short selling is all bad in theory
2239.84s:  But I don't agree with it personally the reason being is because naked short selling if done
2245.84s:  What I would consider to be justly
2248.96s:  Would just increase market efficiency the problem is as with anything related to capital or money
2256.88s:  People are going to look for ways to game the system
2259.04s:  And that's exactly what I think has happened with naked shorting
2262.64s:  I think it's an abomination at this point
2264.56s:  And I think it's completely fucked up with the way that they've allowed that to run out of control
2270.40s:  And I think that it's actually
2273.12s:  My guess is it's not going to stay like that
2275.68s:  And that's one of the reasons why I'm so happy with this Andrew left case
2279.84s:  I got like a hair on my nose with this Andrew left case is because it starts to challenge this a little bit
2287.60s:  And let me grab I actually haven't seen any of the latest here. I don't know if you guys have
2297.12s:  I'm just looking it up really quick
2300.80s:  The latest I see is two days ago's uh here we go
2306.48s:  There's one from stat
2309.92s:  So we could take a look through this together
2316.00s:  And then take a look at this together
2322.96s:  Let me grab the end of this though. I just want to see what this was what this summarizes
2331.28s:  Hmm
2333.44s:  Conclusion here we go our model emphasizes that a stock traders routing choice balances possible price improvement
2342.24s:  Let me just zoom this in more
2346.24s:  Oh, I'll get myself out of the way for a second so that you guys can see
2351.20s:  All right, so this says our model emphasizes that a stock trader routing balances
2356.08s:  um possible price improvement against lower
2360.40s:  probability of execution in the off exchange market
2364.40s:  wider spreads entice off exchange routing which makes a ton of sense
2369.28s:  To trade within the spread a decrease in volatility lowers the range of spreads above and below to a break even level
2376.96s:  When they're above average leads traders to prefer off exchange executions
2381.44s:  So one of the things I think that's this is highlighting for you
2385.76s:  Is that with something that's really volatile like game stop
2389.12s:  There's kind of an incentive to route off exchange because of the volatility
2394.72s:  And what that can do to price
2397.04s:  And I think that that's also something that we've talked about before
2400.72s:  I think that we had a general conversation not all that long ago about the impact that
2409.44s:  um
2410.56s:  volatility has on
2412.88s:  The liquidity of things
2414.56s:  So this doesn't this just doesn't surprise me
2419.44s:  and it says by
2422.40s:  leveraging finras transparency data
2426.56s:  They construct a comprehensive sample
2432.32s:  We find clear support for our model finras data allows platform that are
2437.20s:  Theoretical model suggests that heterogeneity among the platforms is primary around the the probability of finding liquidity
2442.88s:  Yeah, so what this is essentially summarizing
2446.48s:  Which to me is nothing
2450.48s:  It's nothing crazy, but it's essentially summarizing that the
2455.68s:  The decision
2457.36s:  Generally lies in the pursuit of liquidity which again, I don't necessarily think that that surprises anybody
2464.08s:  I mean it definitely doesn't surprise me. That's just a logical a logical decision based on the prospects of liquidity
2470.88s:  So I would fully understand that choice personally
2475.92s:  So
2480.72s:  Lucidio says it seems like a self fulfilling prophecy the more you move to
2484.32s:  ATS in a way from the exchanges the harder it is to get liquidity and the let exchange reinforce in the move
2489.68s:  Yeah, you're absolutely correct. That is 100% correct
2492.80s:  and
2494.16s:  The the way that they're playing this kind of problem is they're just leaning on the near term benefit
2501.60s:  To the individual not the longer term implication which is fairly common
2508.96s:  Right, I think that I think that that's probably not a giant surprise again to you guys
2518.16s:  Oh boy
2519.52s:  Everyone's in a while I just get like one of them
2521.76s:  Sharp shots of pain like that
2524.16s:  It's kind of a it's like a shitty game, but I'll tell you what it definitely keeps you on the ball because there is no fully relaxing
2531.60s:  Um, so yeah, I thought that this was interesting. I wanted to look through it in general with you all
2537.36s:  I think that you guys can poke through this
2540.40s:  Pretty much as much as you want. There was a couple other takeaways
2544.40s:  that I wanted to
2546.40s:  Talk about which is
2548.88s:  exactly
2550.64s:  Literally exactly what
2553.84s:  Lucidio
2555.36s:  Is talking about is that this creates a vicious cycle
2560.80s:  where as more
2563.28s:  volume is preferentially routed
2566.88s:  through
2568.40s:  ATS
2569.84s:  It inherently decreases the depth on lit exchanges
2574.80s:  And then it increases the probability of more routing off exchange
2580.32s:  roaring titty who is being awesome
2583.36s:  Says chiropractor. I actually don't really like chiropractors
2586.40s:  I was at the physical therapist today. That's actually the photo that I shot you guys
2590.40s:  In the discord I was sitting there after getting like traction done and whatnot
2595.12s:  So yeah, you you boys active with trying to fix this whole thing, but I appreciate it. Thank you very much
2600.24s:  Roryne titty you the homie
2602.96s:  The the labo says which screws normal investors sort of again
2606.64s:  I think that's kind of dramatic to be completely honest the the reason why I think it's slightly dramatic is because it
2614.24s:  These kinds of decisions really impact people who are trading at larger
2619.92s:  sizes
2621.12s:  So if you're trading at a smaller size, we still want is liquid of a product is humanly possible
2627.04s:  We want active price discovery of course we want these things
2630.16s:  But when we're submitting a trade for 5,000 shares of GameStop
2635.28s:  It's just not it's just not that liquid for us and you can essentially get a fill
2642.16s:  I mean, I've done it right like you can get a fill on that order pretty easily
2646.40s:  Over the course of just maybe one or two adjustments
2649.20s:  So this becomes way more
2651.84s:  Hurtening to entities that are trying to fill slightly larger trades is all
2657.52s:  Again, I don't disagree with the point that I would prefer it being on exchange personally as well
2662.56s:  But again, I keep going back to this for you guys
2666.16s:  I I really try to look at both sides of things. I want to understand the good the bad the pros the cons
2674.16s:  That kind of stuff and that there are some
2677.60s:  pros some cons
2678.72s:  But in this case the impact to retail traders it's not excessively massive
2685.84s:  In terms of liquidity. I don't want to be miss misunderstood there
2690.96s:  I find that especially a lot of people that are
2694.48s:  Following along with the channel may be relatively new. They'll grab little things that I say and
2700.64s:  Yeah
2701.60s:  They'll think that I'm they'll kind of twist it. I've got hit with a few of those so far
2706.88s:  but um, I think
2710.96s:  Yeah, I think that there there's essentially with respect to liquidity
2715.68s:  It's not hyper detrimental to smaller retail traders like us
2719.92s:  So if it's for price discovery, I think that's a pretty clear loss for everybody
2726.72s:  I think it decreases price discovery that kind of behavior
2731.76s:  All right, let's take a look at this bad boy
2736.24s:  Um, this article analyzes the reach of the duty of best execution
2741.44s:  The off exchange market makers and its implications in the evolving equity market structure
2746.72s:  covers such key themes such as comparative regulatory perspective
2751.20s:  On the source of the duty of best execution. This gets really technical
2755.76s:  So this one I have read actually quite a few times and I can kind of a gloss over
2761.68s:  This with you guys the reason why I want you to be aware of this though is because
2768.32s:  This duty of best execution is really tricky
2773.44s:  And it's really tricky because there's a lot of gray area that comes with it and things like payment for order flow
2781.60s:  Technically speaking still fit into this concept of best execution even though payment for order flow
2789.12s:  It could be made better. It's not optimal for retail traders
2792.56s:  But again, I have to take a step back on that and make sure that I remind everybody that
2798.16s:  Payment for order flow is still light years better for us
2801.68s:  Then what this was when I started trading 15 16 years ago. So while it's not perfect. It's not where I hope it ends up leading us
2811.28s:  It's not terrible. So yeah, there's that
2815.60s:  So anyways
2819.28s:  Let's see let's see where we want to start
2823.28s:  Carl says does that prevent the squeeze by keeping the stock liquid?
2827.92s:  um
2829.44s:  Carl could you
2832.40s:  Oh, it looks like you both are talking about squeeze. Sorry. Can you guys talk to me about what
2836.80s:  If it allows large block trades to be removed from the squeeze it favors those institutions in order I see
2842.32s:  Uh to a degree because the the thing is is if
2845.76s:  If something if there's an order routing change
2850.88s:  Orders that are filled on a dark pool they still get factored into the price eventually
2857.60s:  So can it affect a squeeze? I would say yes
2861.60s:  But I don't I would argue that it can't stop a squeeze because one of the things that we can objectively analyze
2869.20s:  When we look at when squeezes occur is the launch of
2875.44s:  on exchange volume on exchange volume starts to expand typically when we go through different kinds of squeezes
2884.16s:  so
2885.44s:  It's because it kind of forces them on to in exchange
2890.32s:  So I don't I wouldn't say that it um
2894.00s:  Yeah, I wouldn't say that it forces
2898.80s:  I wouldn't say that it decreases the overall severity of a squeeze
2904.08s:  In terms of the propensity for it to happen again
2909.52s:  Dark pool volume is still going to be reflected in price eventually and we can actually get to the bottom of that really quick
2917.76s:  How long do dark pool orders take to be reflected in a stock's price
2934.40s:  Uh, it says it can vary on the factors
2938.96s:  Large dark pool trades especially those executed close to the current market price can have an immediate impact
2944.64s:  Dark pools often have delayed reporting of trades to minimize market impact
2949.12s:  The reporting delay can range from a few seconds to several minutes
2953.36s:  So like in that example right there
2957.52s:  Uh pyro gym says I thought dark pool trades were just private trades that wouldn't ever affect price action
2963.76s:  Oh interesting
2967.36s:  No, uh, let's see if there's like a I wonder if there's like a there's got to be like a cool visual or something
2978.64s:  Let me see if there's like a cool visual
2984.88s:  Hmm
2987.36s:  Don't see anything here that's great
2994.00s:  No, that's regulation
3002.64s:  Here I don't know there's a really good book that I have on dark pools that might be useful
3018.56s:  Oh, he's got to let this get unfrozen and then we'll take a look
3023.84s:  So
3035.12s:  So there's uh, well I'm here it goes
3038.56s:  So
3039.84s:  Where is it this book right here?
3042.40s:  If you guys haven't read this
3046.00s:  It's uh, it really is a pretty solid book
3049.68s:  That goes through essentially how dark pools were derived why they exist
3057.28s:  And how essentially they work
3060.56s:  so
3062.24s:  There's a lot of interesting nuance when it comes to to dark pools
3068.08s:  so
3069.52s:  Typically there are stand alone
3073.68s:  Prokers or
3075.68s:  Systems
3076.96s:  That will match dark pool orders
3080.32s:  So the orders typically are executed anonymously and then they get like dark pool orders are still disclosed
3089.20s:  You still can see them there's just a delay
3095.76s:  So
3096.96s:  Roaring TD says John Stewart is a great retail advocate. I think he is too. I think
3103.04s:  um
3104.72s:  Yeah, and I think that he has an interesting perspective on it
3107.92s:  I do know that his brother is like a pretty big part of one of the exchanges
3111.92s:  So I don't know. I'm a little curious about the actual motivations
3116.80s:  But yeah, I agree with you. I think he's he's overall decent
3120.56s:  Alfonso says dark pool must report their trading activities to finner within 10 seconds
3125.52s:  Yeah, so reporting to finner is one component
3128.32s:  But then also reported to the actual market is a second component
3133.60s:  so and they're they're still compulsory so
3138.00s:  Yeah, after the regulatory reporting the trade details are eventually disclosed to the public typically within a few seconds to a minute
3144.16s:  And then to your point this says trades executed in dark pools are reported to regularly authorities like finra
3150.08s:  In the US within a delay to maintain anonymity which is what you're talking about
3155.68s:  Um
3157.68s:  Um
3159.68s:  That talks about why they're there
3161.76s:  There's a couple different types of own dark pools so broker dealer exchange independent and some of the independence are actually the larger ones
3169.28s:  But broker dealers are like sigma acts cross finder those those sorts of things
3174.72s:  so
3175.92s:  Yeah, the the point is ultimately that
3180.16s:  There's it still is eventually reported
3185.92s:  It's literally how
3188.40s:  We're able to generate plots like this like if you have a bloomberg terminal for example
3196.24s:  On a bloomberg terminal you can see dark pool orders
3200.64s:  so
3202.96s:  Yeah, I think that's the that's the interesting thing about them
3207.12s:  Oh
3213.04s:  It looked like I dropped for a second. I think we're back
3216.96s:  So um, let me see there's uh
3221.28s:  Nolla says if I do a directed trade to a particular exchange
3226.08s:  Uh, what about that
3229.84s:  Gravitaris says our options included in dark pools are only shares. It's typically it's typically not options
3236.24s:  So
3237.36s:  If you're using something like options they have um
3242.24s:  They have a different regulatory routing
3245.12s:  And all options will eventually go through the oh yeah, no list says options are OCC. Yeah, so options are standardized contracts now
3253.28s:  The other thing that I'm not aware of but I am curious about is with something like dark pools if they can use
3261.20s:  exotic derivatives like different kinds of custom swaps and stuff
3266.80s:  So yeah
3270.64s:  All right, Marcus says I have a few questions what are the rules for pre market and after hour trades who trades
3277.76s:  Is the any limits to volume? I don't know if there's limits to volume
3281.52s:  But it essentially just comes down to those who have access and a lot of people have access depending on your broker
3286.96s:  You might have access
3288.64s:  So pre pre-trait like pre-imposed market hour trading is not quite as elusive as people might think it is
3296.96s:  The only downside to it is that things are typically very liquid during those periods
3303.20s:  so
3305.20s:  Scott says are large derivative contracts reflected on the dark pool or they just flow until realized
3310.88s:  so
3314.48s:  Um, trying to understand your question
3317.20s:  When you say large derivative contracts you talk about options positions because if so then they're going to go across
3322.24s:  Illite exchange typically
3329.76s:  Matt says with the overall pain in the market right now do you consider the cash GME raised was a good move definitely
3336.96s:  I think the cash that
3338.80s:  GME raised is overall good for them in general and the reason why is because
3346.40s:  I think
3347.92s:  By going that route it gives them like literally the best possible opportunity to reinvent themselves
3355.84s:  because
3357.12s:  again
3358.64s:  I know the apes really love GameStop and do a lot to support GameStop which I'm all about I love that
3364.64s:  from a broader company perspective though as like a brick and mortar
3370.40s:  business
3371.76s:  they
3373.04s:  like they have a
3374.64s:  offering right they do have things like we talked about on that one stream with newton
3379.60s:  Which he and I I think just so you guys know I think he and I are locked in for our next stream on the 17th
3388.40s:  Because I'm going to be out of pocket for a little bit so the daily videos and stuff like that they're going to dry up
3394.56s:  For about a week and change just so you guys know I'm not like uh disappearing on you all
3400.24s:  I'm just stepping stepping out of the office as it were for a little bit
3405.12s:  But I will be back
3409.12s:  I will be back
3411.12s:  But anyways, yeah the next stream with newton will be then which is great because he and I we we're still texting essentially every day
3419.20s:  And I have a million things that he and I are gonna have to uh
3425.44s:  That he and I are gonna have to cover
3428.48s:  So yeah
3431.28s:  Hmm
3433.36s:  Back to the original question I think it's good in a nutshell. I think it's good
3436.48s:  I think having a bunch of cash is going to help them
3440.48s:  And I think that by them increasing their cash position it'll it'll it'll it does allow them to innovate
3447.28s:  Now one of the things I was curious is they were going to start going on a little bit of a acquisition spree
3452.40s:  But I haven't seen that really come to fruition yet which actually surprises me a little bit
3457.76s:  Because they raised a bunch of cash and I thought that they were going to be a bit more active in using it
3463.12s:  But I and this is one of the things that I understand the frustrations. Let me take a look at uh
3469.12s:  GME shareholder meeting
3473.60s:  From the last shareholder meeting I know that there was a lot of
3479.68s:  Enxed I guess you could say
3482.40s:  There was some angst I suppose
3484.72s:  Around what they talked about I'm trying to look for the notes. It was 23 April right is this correct?
3493.12s:  Do I have this right?
3497.36s:  GME Q2Ns tomorrow. Yeah, their quarter well a lot of companies are in the same same bucket there
3504.08s:  Is this the right thing
3506.88s:  You
3521.44s:  Is this
3523.92s:  Was this correct? I just want to make sure I'm looking at the right proxy statement. I wanted to read through this with you guys
3530.40s:  I just don't know if this is the right the right thing it looks correct
3533.60s:  This is
3535.60s:  This is
3537.44s:  From 13 June
3541.44s:  Yes, okay cool. Thank you roaring titty the latency on this is kind of annoying
3546.24s:  I have it set for low latency, but there's an ultra low setting which I typically use
3551.12s:  But normally since I'm doing these with new and through zoom there's a little bit more of a delay, but anyways
3557.52s:  Uh, let's see
3560.32s:  Uh, this is the board of directors stuff
3566.16s:  Executive compensation independent stock holder proposal
3574.72s:  We don't care about these
3578.88s:  We don't care about these
3582.64s:  We do not care about these
3589.68s:  Governance clawback. Yeah, yeah, yeah compensation
3608.40s:  So it looks like they are all getting 200,000 in two bucks
3616.00s:  And stock
3619.92s:  Except Ryan Cohen right I didn't see him. I think he's
3626.32s:  I think you guys were saying
3628.48s:  If I'm not mistaken that he just buys his stuff
3633.12s:  Blackrock wait, did you guys know that
3637.20s:  That surprises me a little bit
3641.04s:  It seemed like
3642.32s:  Blackrock was I don't know when I look through the the GME communities
3646.40s:  It looks like in general people don't like Blackrock
3654.72s:  Or is that just citadel that like the apes don't like
3663.92s:  Be okay pensions Blackrock owns a little bit of everything
3670.64s:  They were behind prop four low position for Blackrock
3677.36s:  So citadel yeah, I definitely saw citadel people don't like
3684.32s:  Okay, so it sounds like you guys are yeah, no, I'm I'm well aware of how deep Blackrock goes fun fact
3690.56s:  Um some of the commercial real estate stuff that I do with some partners
3693.84s:  We actually acquire things like student housing
3697.52s:  We just acquired a couple more ski resorts that will then operate
3702.56s:  And we start to find that some of the things that we're looking at which is not like a small level
3708.40s:  But it's not a big level that we start kind of bumping into to Blackrock
3713.12s:  Which is interesting homies are literally everywhere
3716.32s:  But yeah, no, I'm super well aware that Blackrock is nuts
3720.32s:  Royne titty says look at prop four on the boat. Yeah, sure uh is that up here
3726.00s:  Let's see
3728.00s:  prop
3730.80s:  Uh
3732.24s:  For can I count?
3734.40s:  What the fuck's that a
3737.28s:  Okay, here we go prop one prop two prop three prop four yeah 41 that's what I was trying to get to
3742.64s:  Okay, so now here's the next question
3746.24s:  When I click 41 here is it actually going to be this or is it going to be the stupid pdf difference
3752.56s:  And 41 will be a couple pages off of this any guesses
3756.16s:  So like one of my most like most annoying things I hate
3760.96s:  About pdf documents is it'll say the number here
3765.52s:  And then when you click it it'll be pdf something else
3769.44s:  Let's see what page this is what pages this
3774.32s:  35 not even close why what
3779.20s:  Why do they do this? It's so stupid
3782.88s:  Everybody does this. I hate it so much
3786.56s:  Just
3787.52s:  Fucking make it match
3790.48s:  Literally just make it match
3792.64s:  Everybody knows that when you're going to use this you're going to flip through like this so give these pages
3799.04s:  Oh so stupid
3801.68s:  So stupid
3803.76s:  You have to go to like not page fucking
3806.88s:  41 or whatever it's page
3809.60s:  fucking
3811.68s:  47
3813.20s:  Oh so annoying
3815.60s:  He ate that I hate that so much all right here we go
3819.84s:  Rans aside
3822.32s:  We expect prop four to be presented to the control of New York cities custodian trustee employees system
3828.80s:  E C C C C
3830.88s:  Proposal was submitted by the comptroller yees
3835.12s:  Uh
3836.88s:  Jeffrey Jones what up good to see you
3841.20s:  Cactus shacks as flip tables. No, I really I have a really nice standing desk
3847.28s:  That's actually how you guys will see me stand and sit throughout the things at the electronic big fan big big fan
3853.44s:  Um this says share holders of GameStop request that board of directors disclose its annual proxies statement self identified bullshit skills
3866.80s:  Yeah, I don't care about any of that. Roryn titty. What am I here for
3870.96s:  Tell me what I'm supposed to be looking for
3873.28s:  Because I typically trust you with what you send me to
3878.32s:  The board unanimously recommends that stockholders vote against prop four
3884.32s:  The propose over requesting board skills and diversity matrix proxy solicited. I love that
3890.32s:  Fuck yes
3892.32s:  What a shocking what a shocking concept of trying to hire people based on fucking qualifications
3899.76s:  This is great
3901.92s:  GameStop does not set a specific minimum qualifications for nominees for
3906.80s:  Director and does not have a policy regarding the consideration of diversity for such nominees
3911.76s:  We do not believe diversity whether gendered is a meaningful basis by which to identify and assess the qualifications of a director
3918.40s:  I love this so much. This is fantastic
3921.60s:  Our board is composed of individuals who exhibit these traits big fan
3928.48s:  Big fan that's awesome
3936.88s:  Uh
3938.08s:  Wait, where does it say who proposed it?
3942.72s:  Let's see if he says Microsoft just fired all the DEI people yeah, well, I think they started
3947.28s:  I think companies are starting to get abreast
3949.76s:  My guess is some of what's going on here is
3953.92s:  DEI was a giant focus for a little while
3958.96s:  And then as that starts to come out of vogue to a degree
3963.36s:  I think people are realizing that hiring like specific DEI resources is a giant suck of resources
3970.24s:  And I think that it I mean, I don't want to go too far down the path of like you know diversity and whatnot
3977.52s:  I'm you know whatever
3979.60s:  But my opinion is and has always been just fucking higher qualified people
3985.12s:  I think that that's essentially the the way I would want things to go
3992.08s:  Um
3993.12s:  Hyrogim says the proposal was submitted by the New York City Comptroller
3999.76s:  Who'd at though
4002.24s:  We expect to be presented by the Comptroller of New York City as the custodian
4009.20s:  and a trustee of the New York City employee retirement system
4024.88s:  I'm confused
4030.56s:  I'm really confused what is the New York City employee employees retirement system has to do with this
4042.72s:  pension fund that owns GME all their investors oh
4050.16s:  I see
4053.04s:  Lucidio says read the next paragraph
4056.96s:  That's literally my favorite comment read you idiot and it'll answer your question. There we go
4064.48s:  um
4065.76s:  Wait, you think blackrock owns this
4071.04s:  Let me see that would be surprising to me if they did
4083.12s:  You
4091.68s:  New York State Comptroller yeah because this to me seems like a a government function no
4102.08s:  Ruined to the says blackrock was behind that I'm pretty sure I thought I heard the comptroller said blackrock was
4108.08s:  3.5% of the shareholders
4110.64s:  Oh
4111.84s:  I see
4115.52s:  Chris Demel says he was hidden ahead too many times but thank you very much patience. That's exactly right
4120.56s:  I've had more than my fair share of concussions at this point in my life
4125.28s:  I really appreciate the support
4129.20s:  Because you boy I mean realistically you boy needs it you boy just needs it
4135.84s:  So yeah
4137.44s:  Thank you. Thank you Chris spelt with a K my brother's name is also Chris but spelt normally
4146.32s:  Chris with a K is kind of uh
4148.88s:  It's kind of aggressive I think it's cool but a little bit different
4155.60s:  But yeah, this looks like a government system. I don't see blackrock here
4162.32s:  So where where is their involvement uh and you're like that you guys are speculating on
4168.08s:  You're like a blackrock
4174.08s:  Let me see really quick black rock involvement
4186.64s:  The okay might be the admin
4189.52s:  So
4191.52s:  This says
4193.52s:  Chatchy PT says the
4195.52s:  New York City employees retirement system is actively involved with blackrock both as an investor and as a client
4204.72s:  And and why cres has approximately 40 million invested in blackrock which makes sense
4211.20s:  And blackrock manages around 19 billion on behalf of and why cres so you guys are absolutely right see this wife
4218.72s:  In love apes bro you guys are always
4221.92s:  In on shit you guys know what the fuck is going on
4226.96s:  So yes recently and why cres has used its annual share power to influence decisions at black rock
4235.20s:  particularly concerning the appointment of board members
4239.20s:  And why cres along with the new york city comptroller brad lander urge black rock share holders to vote against
4246.40s:  The election of a min nacer the CEO of southe
4250.80s:  Aramaiko to blackrock's board the opposition was based on potential conflicts of interest over human rights climate issues
4259.52s:  Despite the efforts of n y c rs including filing an exempt solicitation with the scc and highlighting the risk of having on the board
4267.52s:  Blackrock shareholders you ultimately reelected him the filing pointed out that the position
4273.68s:  SEO of aramako a major fossil fuel company conflicts with black rock stated goals of decarbonization
4281.20s:  The involvement so it looked that's a really dynamic relationship as I read about it. It's both
4288.16s:  So it doesn't look like blackrock controls this it looks like there's actually a little bit of back and forth there
4294.48s:  Which I find really really interesting
4297.44s:  Benoit balls says pronounced a ramco
4301.92s:  A ramco
4304.32s:  I like a romco so they can go fuck themselves
4308.08s:  I call them I call them eramaiko
4310.96s:  That's what I call them
4315.68s:  Marcus says a little long objective in scope to keep jack to these guidelines are to ensure inclusive culture. Yeah
4324.24s:  That's interesting
4327.28s:  Well, it's good they got shot down
4331.52s:  backs
4337.68s:  Financial statements
4347.28s:  All right, that's that I was curious if they had anything about the cash I think we can probably kill this
4356.40s:  All right
4359.20s:  So the next thing that I wanted to take a look at with some of
4365.68s:  old
4367.12s:  roaring kitty option straights for me to develop his fingerprint a little bit more
4371.60s:  But we can we again anything that you guys want to take a look at throw it in the chat
4377.20s:  A pyro gem. What was that book on algo wars the there's two of them. So the one that I was referring to you guys before
4385.36s:  was called
4388.32s:  Uh
4390.32s:  Dark pools by Scott Patterson is that one
4395.20s:  Justin says arcade charts can I post a link yeah happy to take a look
4398.32s:  I don't think you can post a link
4399.84s:  roaring titties the one that educated me that that you can't I don't think it lets anybody else because it's straight up disrespectful
4407.44s:  Money ting says lawsuit. Yeah, let's take a look at that lawsuit
4411.44s:  And so anyways a couple books that I think you guys should check out
4416.00s:  Uh dark pools is a great one
4418.48s:  And then trading in exchanges this is like one of the best
4422.48s:  Literally one of the best just general it's old unfortunately
4426.40s:  But it's got a ton of great market structure details in there and then
4432.08s:  Inside the black box is also I think pertinent to you all here which is pretty cool
4439.36s:  All right, so uh justin says rory rory
4445.60s:  kit dinger
4448.32s:  charts
4453.76s:  Uh wait, do you mean the ones from I was gonna grab the ones from newton no
4463.68s:  Because newton I think on his google sheet he has like the the list of arcades
4470.72s:  Arcades charts from yahu finance, right
4475.20s:  Am I am I off base here
4481.20s:  Yo, I tell him all the time that I love what he's doing, but I can't find shit on here
4489.84s:  No, he's to and he has this stuff mapped like the back of his damn head. It's crazy
4495.84s:  I
4500.64s:  Know rk has his own stock charts. All right, where am I supposed to go
4505.36s:  So I thought I was looking at roaring kiddie's charts
4509.84s:  But you guys are saying that he has his other his his own shit
4516.56s:  Oh, sorry, didn't mean to hit the mic
4520.72s:  Where the hell's this chart go to stock charts got it
4524.08s:  Going to stock charts as directed
4527.84s:  I am now at stock charts and then I'm supposed to look up roaring
4535.44s:  Kiddinger
4540.08s:  Uh, nothing pops up
4544.64s:  Am I the right spot
4554.00s:  Oh
4559.20s:  Rory
4561.60s:  Rory
4570.00s:  The disrespect
4573.76s:  Not giving me shit. All right, Rory Rory
4578.08s:  Kiddinger
4583.60s:  Kiddinger
4587.84s:  This pops up
4602.88s:  Rory
4608.88s:  Uh link in the chat down at the bottom
4611.60s:  I
4613.60s:  Don't think you guys can drop oh
4616.00s:  If you put it in the discord I can find it if any of you guys are in the discord if you drop it in there
4620.40s:  I can grab it in like two seconds. They'd be much faster
4623.52s:  Rory and titty is making sure you all know that links do not show up in here by default
4632.08s:  Uh, let me see. I'll try to do like a control F in here
4636.40s:  Uh
4639.36s:  Ha this one
4643.28s:  Did we find it
4646.32s:  Hey, yeah, this is the one that Newton has on his stuff
4651.28s:  We found it we did it. I just have to see if I can find it in here because he has it in here somewhere
4657.84s:  This one
4662.80s:  This one
4664.80s:  Man you guys sent me down. Damn it. I knew they had it. All right, we found it. We're good. We found it. We made it
4674.32s:  I think that this might cause for a slight celebration cheers everybody
4681.12s:  Hmm
4682.40s:  That's a problem. It's a big problem
4684.64s:  So right now we're out of crystal that one's gone
4688.96s:  The mango orange that's now gone
4691.60s:  So we are moving on to the backup beverage
4695.20s:  Which is what do we have
4697.44s:  Um black berry lemonade. I forgot I could put my hand behind it. I think so you can see it
4703.20s:  black berry
4705.52s:  lemonade
4708.40s:  There we go
4709.92s:  We're back in it
4712.64s:  You boy
4714.64s:  Consumes a lot of liquid. All right, so
4718.88s:  Let's see what what do you guys want to look at here anything in particular
4724.16s:  What do I see uh this one I don't really care about
4728.08s:  To be honest because it's all intraday. It's like really really short term stuff
4733.04s:  uh, let me
4735.04s:  Let me move this back over here
4737.52s:  Move this over here
4740.48s:  And then
4743.12s:  I'll get rid of myself again because nobody really cares to see me
4748.08s:  And then this way you guys can see a little bit better. I will zoom us in
4755.76s:  That should be decent for you guys. Yeah
4762.00s:  All right, so what do we want to look at it looks like
4766.32s:  Uh
4768.40s:  Rhyme to the says roll down and then we want to look at rsi pre 2011
4774.16s:  Then the ones kiddie has circled are interesting. Let's do it
4777.52s:  Let's see what those look like. Okay, I see
4782.32s:  So this is on a weekly and
4786.40s:  And
4790.72s:  He's using a 14 day rsi and he's showing it looks like a divergence here
4798.16s:  Is what I'm seeing
4800.32s:  So this was back in 2021
4804.72s:  And
4806.72s:  He's just showing a couple instances where it looks like rsi divergence
4811.60s:  The problem
4813.20s:  I would say let me slide that out of the way. Let's go to game stop. Let's do again
4817.76s:  We can essentially recreate it to a degree. We'll do a 10-year weekly
4822.00s:  And if we zoom this in
4825.20s:  So it's a little easier to see
4828.64s:  Let me go to 21 here
4831.20s:  You zoom this in more
4835.12s:  So the cci also did a similar thing right so one of the first things to note is
4841.84s:  Oscillators are
4844.16s:  slightly notorious for a lot of mixed triggers and again, I've spent a lot of oh shit
4851.44s:  pie
4852.64s:  Hi ro mjm. I was calling you pyro gym in my mind
4857.12s:  But pyro shout out to you welcome to be an outlier supporter really really appreciate it
4862.16s:  I also realized that I'm still a ghost here. So here I am. I'm back. Can't get rid of me
4867.20s:  I also just looked at myself for the first time on this stream
4870.00s:  And I didn't realize that one that I was like glowing take hold on. Let's let's play a game
4874.16s:  Let's turn this brightness like all the way up. Check that out
4879.44s:  Oh my god that goes super bright. There it is feels like
4884.24s:  I am
4885.60s:  Looking at the sun
4886.88s:  But anyways the other thing I realized looking at myself is that you boy need to haircut because this is just not it
4895.12s:  Justin says angelic
4896.72s:  Maybe if we put it behind me it would look a little more angelic, but nothing about me is
4902.56s:  angelic
4903.92s:  So anyways looking at oscillators oscillators have a really mixed track record
4908.96s:  And I think it's important to be aware of that because I can find a lot of instances even with something like cci
4914.56s:  where cci is very high and prices diverging. So
4919.60s:  I just I think it's important to point that out but let's add a study here
4923.36s:  And then let's take a look at rsi specifically and he's using a 14 day rsi which is a default setting by the way
4930.96s:  Yeah, so we have 14 day rsi here
4933.76s:  And then we'll just leave that for now and again, I'll get rid of myself so that you can see me
4941.60s:  and
4943.84s:  So what I see here
4946.72s:  is
4949.20s:  The same thing we're obviously
4951.92s:  It's going to line up with what you're tracking on his chart right like this big
4957.36s:  um
4958.64s:  Big divergence, but the the thing is is you'll find other instances
4963.52s:  where rsi is peaking
4966.08s:  or even cci is peaking
4969.52s:  And stock price isn't necessarily playing ball and you'll find the inverse
4974.88s:  where you will find
4977.12s:  something like
4979.44s:  cci or rsi again, it's it's just a oscillator you can essentially call all the oscillators the same thing
4987.12s:  It's like they behave slightly differently, but they're all the same shit
4990.80s:  So
4992.00s:  You'll find instances where the oscillators are actually declining and the underlying is going up
4997.60s:  So it's just something to be aware of right there's nothing wrong with using oscillators
5002.88s:  Again, I have one there's a reason why you cci is because based on my studies for the stuff that I trade cci tends to behave
5011.60s:  a little bit better
5013.68s:  for
5014.72s:  My needs
5016.24s:  But
5017.44s:  Yeah, anyways, I figured
5019.84s:  We would take a look at it in here, but we can go back to these charts though
5025.04s:  I'm finished poking through
5027.36s:  um
5029.44s:  Dr. Zayas says cci measures the current price level relative to an average price level over a given period time
5035.76s:  Yeah
5037.04s:  Oh, I think you were just explaining what cci is for people. Thank you very much
5040.24s:  I did not realize that uh, it wasn't like well understood my bad
5045.04s:  That's on me
5051.12s:  Um
5053.36s:  Let's see what else is in here quick
5059.36s:  Uh
5062.24s:  Money ting says don't forget about the lawsuit. Yeah, we'll pull that up right after this promise. Let me grab that
5070.00s:  Uh, gme lawsuit
5072.96s:  dropped
5076.40s:  And we'll grab that from
5079.52s:  Rooters
5083.60s:  So we won't we won't forget we won't forget again
5089.52s:  Uh
5092.40s:  Hanyah says nssc is making a new system for exercise options allowing fdds to be infinitely fd tomorrow well
5102.48s:  Hmm
5105.52s:  We'll take a look at that
5109.20s:  We'll take a look at that a little oh fuck sorry the transitions really are
5114.32s:  Comfortables fuck
5116.48s:  We'll take a look at that
5118.80s:  Is well
5120.40s:  But the the fact of the matter is if we think about ftds there
5126.40s:  There are already allowed to be perpetually deferred as annoying as it is as much bullshit as that is
5132.48s:  Because
5133.76s:  We can see a lot of instances where
5138.24s:  Things are running higher
5140.48s:  ftds
5142.08s:  And nothing happens so
5144.56s:  Yeah, I mean we'll we'll take a closer look at that, but let's finish here
5149.28s:  And it says uh
5151.28s:  Camp hire says what does the blue dotted line on the first chart represent. Let's go
5158.08s:  blue dotted line
5160.80s:  This
5162.32s:  To me that just looks like a center line
5164.40s:  You mean this one in here the horizontal line in the rsi or which blue dotted line
5170.64s:  Talk to me
5175.04s:  At
5177.84s:  $23
5183.36s:  At
5184.88s:  Oh and think or swim yo that's confusing to me you have me tripping
5190.32s:  A blue dotted line and think or swim
5193.92s:  I don't know if I have one of those
5196.08s:  You
5200.32s:  It sounds like you might know my chart better than I know my chart what blue dotted line you talking about
5206.00s:  In here
5213.52s:  It's a small dotted line on the chart you had up
5217.20s:  So this one's think or swim
5219.44s:  Right doctors a says
5222.24s:  Blue dotted line and thicker swim
5224.72s:  Camp hire says it's a small dotted line on the chart you had up which is this one
5234.32s:  Do you mean here over here that looks like a price level
5238.64s:  Like right at the end. I see right at yeah, okay. Yeah, that's just a price level
5243.20s:  I don't think that that really means anything more than that
5247.52s:  Yeah, I think it's just a price level
5249.68s:  Is
5251.60s:  Is there anything else that we wanted to look at on these charts before we go over to that case
5263.84s:  Also
5267.20s:  Let me
5269.44s:  Oh, I kind of want to try one second
5276.16s:  YouTube
5277.92s:  Change stream latency
5282.32s:  midstream
5295.36s:  Trying to see if there's a way
5299.04s:  To change the the latency while we're still live
5303.20s:  I might wait a little bit later just in case it nukes it
5307.28s:  I think I can stop streaming and then it might let me do it, but I'll try it later
5317.36s:  Um look at the RSI that rk circled. Okay, let's find that
5325.12s:  I think we were just looking at that, weren't we?
5328.16s:  This one
5330.48s:  We were just looking at this one this I think he was just hiding it highlighting a divergence
5338.64s:  This doesn't
5340.88s:  Yeah, this doesn't really
5344.56s:  At least I don't think I don't think this means a whole lot at least to me
5352.96s:  There's another one higher to this one you see
5360.80s:  Cody says cat ears. I mean it could be cat ears if the cat has one really good ear and then one terrible fucked up ear that has like a mutation coming out of it
5374.80s:  Cedric says undersold two times made big move up
5380.24s:  Well, this wouldn't be this wouldn't be undersold this would be
5384.64s:  Yeah, like this is something that's
5390.64s:  technically overbought
5392.72s:  Things that are running up that high
5396.00s:  Cedric says volume RSI sloping up after being undersold
5402.72s:  Yep
5405.36s:  Yeah, okay, I see you guys are doing I would recommend not doing that
5410.16s:  The
5411.68s:  Reason why I think that there's a bit of an issue is because again like
5419.60s:  The looking back at price movements and corresponding them to different kinds of indicators is like the purest form of overfitting
5428.80s:  And you can find tons of instances after the fact. It's a very easy to do
5435.04s:  So it creates a natural conflict in kind of our minds
5440.08s:  So let me move this up the price chart is a little squished, but that's okay. It doesn't necessarily matter too much
5447.36s:  And let's like let's do that same exercise right like let's say that I see
5453.44s:  Uh significant
5455.76s:  Cedric says you won't find one with big volume after being oversold
5464.96s:  Right here
5472.32s:  What do you mean
5476.32s:  Cedric says you won't find one with big volume after being oversold so this is oversold
5484.88s:  And then this is big volume during the oversold
5488.24s:  Cedric says that's the
5493.04s:  He means another one. Oh, I see yeah, let's let's take a look and but see the one from the chart we're looking at is from 2021
5503.28s:  And this one was from yeah, these are from 2021
5508.24s:  I see what you mean I'm following now. So you're saying that
5511.68s:  RK is saying to look back at this and uses this as a reference
5517.92s:  Okay, got it. Yeah, let's take a look
5527.12s:  Oh, let's go to
5531.60s:  Let's do like a 10 year daily
5537.20s:  Uh right here is an example
5540.72s:  Where volume was oversold
5544.24s:  It had relatively big spike in volume and price didn't move much
5552.80s:  Here's another example
5559.28s:  Here's another example after the fact
5565.28s:  So
5567.36s:  Those are four additional instances three or four additional instances where price was marked oversold
5575.36s:  and it had larger confirmatory volume
5578.80s:  And in this case the big move already happened when you got that indicator
5585.52s:  Cedric says those have bullish for of course they do that's that's what I'm trying to explain to you is that this is after the fact
5593.44s:  Right, so after the fact it's so easy to say like oh yeah, it went up here
5599.68s:  And then this all happened when you're when you're forward looking the line changes based on what's happening today
5607.92s:  So what this isn't capturing are the periods like here right this line is also oversold
5614.80s:  and
5615.92s:  When like that's the nature of the oscillator
5619.20s:  Is that you're always essentially going to find that as the oscillator is high price will be high as the oscillator is low price will be low
5627.60s:  So that part is like really again, it's really easy to align that
5633.44s:  Looking back in time
5635.84s:  But when you're looking at
5638.32s:  Uh Cedric says that's overbought. No. Yeah, that's what the the red is up here above 70 is overbought
5644.72s:  So that's bullish that tip like in order for in order for it to get to overbought price has to have moved up
5653.12s:  And in order for it to get to a point where it's oversold price has to have moved down
5658.64s:  So that that's the concept right overbought meaning too many people bought it driving price up oversold too many people sold it driving price down
5668.00s:  so
5669.44s:  Cedric says I don't want to see it at red. I mean, I don't know why because when it's at red is when it's peaking the the highest moves
5677.12s:  You're going to see from a historic perspective are going to be when it's above 70
5682.08s:  That's what pushes it above 70 that's what RSI is looking at literally those moves specifically
5692.40s:  So I think that you actually want
5696.00s:  I think you want it to be red actually
5699.52s:  Because that's when you're going to see it making the bigger up moves. That's what drives it above 70
5706.56s:  If you don't have bigger up moves like that it won't make that kind of move
5712.88s:  Justin says I want to see blue then red. I mean if we're up to me. I would want to see no blue
5717.76s:  Again, in order for it to be blue it means it needs to be pushed down. It needs to be really really low
5724.64s:  So then you'll see like a period here where it's deep blue
5728.56s:  And it ran that way and then it just declined from that period for some time and still it started getting strength
5736.88s:  Right to D says am I the only one confused. Oh shit. I didn't realize that this was confusing. Yeah, let's okay
5742.16s:  So RSI relative strength indicator. I can grab you the actual permutation for that's calculated one sec RSI
5749.12s:  I
5754.08s:  Here you go. So there's two papers that I would refer you to
5760.24s:  This is a good paper on it
5764.56s:  So I would highly recommend checking this paper out. It goes through the actual kind of math
5771.92s:  behind it
5773.44s:  and so
5775.84s:  Cedric says I buy oversold stock not overbought. I mean yeah that that could be your approach whatever
5781.52s:  Whatever makes it happy is cool
5783.44s:  But what I can tell you is shit that's oversold is going down. So me personally that's that's not when I buy stocks
5790.48s:  I buy things if I'm buying stock
5793.44s:  I want something to go up
5795.60s:  So I'm going to wait for it to be going up the problem is what you're employing is a really common trader behavior
5803.04s:  Which is bargain buying and it's a misapplication of a really standardized thought process that you have as a human consumer
5814.24s:  So we're taught from a natural perspective to enjoy bargains. We like sales
5820.72s:  Right, that's why if you go to a lot of stores
5823.12s:  They have sales perpetually. Is it really a sale if there's always one going on? No not at all
5829.60s:  It's just a marketing ploy because they know people like sales
5834.00s:  The problem with that with respect to something like carrying that over to the market is that things that are on sale
5840.88s:  Are on sale for a reason means they're going down
5845.28s:  So if I'm buying stock and I want something to go
5850.16s:  Up when I buy stock I don't want to buy it when it's going down
5855.60s:  I want to buy it when it's going up
5858.16s:  That takes a long time
5860.56s:  In order to like reconfigure the mind but you'll make you'll typically do much better in that way
5868.08s:  Or you can be like Las Sejas the yummy and says it rips. I watch to telephone numbers
5874.16s:  So they're not trying to buy at a discount or to buy when it's oversold or too low
5880.88s:  But they're just buying and they're going to keep buying which that's totally chill
5885.68s:  That's another approach
5887.44s:  Now the idea
5891.20s:  yet
5894.32s:  Chris says oh fuck here we go chat needs fixed ASAP
5900.88s:  That confused me that sentence not following you there but yeah
5906.32s:  I think
5908.88s:  Cedric says I meant like back test on gme buying oversold and only if bullish volume comes in
5917.68s:  Um
5922.56s:  Um
5925.76s:  I'm trying to think of a way to explain that
5928.64s:  So you're you're very rarely going to see that condition
5932.24s:  Where something is wait oversold or overbought let me make sure
5937.12s:  Oversold and only bullish if volume comes in um again
5943.76s:  What you're going to find is when volume hits
5948.16s:  Oversold
5949.92s:  It's going to be at or when rsi hits oversold. It's typically going to be at the inverse extreme
5957.68s:  Then when it's overbought
5960.00s:  So if we look at oversold here. Let's just squish this down look at volume
5965.76s:  The majority of instances that you're going to see oversold is when volume is
5972.32s:  Generally speaking going to be relatively high on the sales side but slowing down
5977.44s:  That's when this will peak
5979.60s:  Is at that juncture and then to the upside it's typically the inverse where you'll see volume doesn't have to be by volume only
5988.24s:  But you'll see volume very very high when this is peaking because again, that's what causes these peaks
5994.80s:  It's a pretty standardized relationship with the tool. It's literally how it's calculated
6000.64s:  It's what it's looking at
6002.96s:  Uh leapfrog says why not look at the three-month chart. Oh, we can look at the three-month chart
6008.32s:  I'm happy to
6010.80s:  Anything in particular you want to peek out here
6018.32s:  Justine says I think he means a condition of oversold
6021.68s:  Followed by relatively high volume days after
6026.80s:  Uh, what about that? Let me grab my RSI back. Oh, I still have it my bed
6040.24s:  And we're looking at oversold still um sorry leapfrogs. I have to switch from the three-month so that I can see
6050.24s:  We're uh
6052.72s:  Chris says your chat is like three minutes late. Yeah, I know there's a bigger delay than I like
6057.20s:  Let me try I'm gonna try to stop the stream really quick from OBS and see if it lets me change it give me one second
6073.92s:  All right, I think we're back unfortunately it doesn't let me change the latency when it's on
6078.80s:  This is the it's because I'm using the one that I normally am doing when I'm streaming with Newton
6084.48s:  Um
6087.04s:  Justin says I think somebody says it would be a good by opportunity
6090.16s:  Again, like I can tell you from a quantitative perspective. It's typically not but if somebody likes it
6095.92s:  I would not say don't do it
6098.24s:  But you'll find periods like those two indicators by themselves to me aren't sufficient
6105.20s:  Like I wouldn't I personally wouldn't base an entry decision
6109.36s:  off of the condition being light
6112.64s:  RSI
6113.84s:  Meaning oversold and
6116.24s:  Expanding volume like that that would not be enough for me
6120.08s:  And it's because of the way that the tools are calculated
6123.60s:  So yeah, I mean it just requires more than that for me because for example this starts hitting oversold here
6131.12s:  On this day up here, which again the price is so flat here because of the the extremes
6138.24s:  I don't know if this lets me move the chart up does it
6148.80s:  That's kind of annoying
6154.00s:  Uh
6155.04s:  Pirates is double click it doesn't
6160.64s:  Yeah, I was gonna say double click doesn't work that auto auto centers it. It's completely different
6167.12s:  Nick says why don't you use log mode because log mode kind of perverts
6171.76s:  Um
6172.80s:  Perverts how price like how you're actually tracking price
6176.72s:  So I don't hate it. It has its purpose
6179.68s:  But yeah, it's not my go-to anyways
6183.12s:  Going back to this it doesn't really matter that much because I can see the prices on the on the right hand side
6189.52s:  This originally became technically
6192.48s:  Oversold on this day here and this day here was 14 aug
6199.20s:  And it came in at let's just say the close was 1996
6204.72s:  So then the volume on this day was 3.3 million
6208.16s:  So let's scroll to the right until we see more volume above 3.3 million
6212.24s:  I see 3.7 million here
6214.96s:  Which is at 22
6218.16s:  Nope
6223.44s:  My bad
6226.08s:  I'm gonna go back
6230.16s:  Oh, where did it go
6234.96s:  1.8 4.6
6237.52s:  So I see 4.6 million volume here
6241.68s:  But you can see where that comes in we're out of oversold that's gone that condition has left us
6249.68s:  So this is the the general problem that you'll have if those are your two indicators personally
6255.52s:  I don't really see
6257.84s:  I don't really see the overall benefit to limiting yourself to that
6261.20s:  He says he means weekly well then if you mean weekly you've had no indicators for the past five years
6267.52s:  except here
6269.84s:  And if you had listened to that indicator of
6274.40s:  Expanding volume so this went from the trowel here is at 88
6279.60s:  And then you got 204 million volume here at 19
6286.00s:  August it looks like
6288.72s:  And games stop here closed at 91 cents
6294.32s:  And then if I fast forward
6300.48s:  Kind of to I don't know how long you would hold for like what the exit condition is but in February third
6307.12s:  It was at 95 cents close
6310.40s:  So you got in at 91 you'd get out at 95 there or if you kept holding you would be in at a low of 64
6317.20s:  All I'm saying is like if it works for you
6319.52s:  I'm happy for you. You should absolutely continue to use it
6322.72s:  But what I can tell you is from again like an objective trading perspective
6327.68s:  Like I wouldn't limit myself to those two indicators because there's no imperative to do so and secondly
6333.76s:  Those two indicators alone are going to put you in a lot of pain very frequently
6341.44s:  That's not to say that they can't eventually
6344.96s:  Move where you want it to go
6347.36s:  But then it's also important to remember that there's an opportunity cost with where we're parking money
6352.72s:  so
6353.84s:  If I put money in something here like this right the first of February
6357.92s:  And the first of February it's trading at 1490 and then come the second of May
6364.24s:  It's at 12
6366.40s:  Not a big price change necessarily it's down a few bucks
6370.48s:  But it's also been parked there doing nothing for me for three months
6375.68s:  Right like I want to be able to make money over the course of that three months
6380.24s:  That's part of being like an efficient trader
6383.52s:  So yeah
6386.32s:  The the cliff notes of that is like whatever works for you do that
6390.00s:  But for me, I demand a hell of a lot more
6394.80s:  In terms of deciding when I'm choosing to to buy or sell personally
6399.60s:  But yeah, totally cool
6402.16s:  All right, what else should we look at we still got a few minutes left
6405.12s:  I'm actually going to get ready to launch my dinner order
6407.28s:  But it won't be here for a little bit
6409.12s:  So tonight we are going to do Greek food
6413.76s:  I'm going to get me some
6415.92s:  Baklava, I love some Baklava
6418.80s:  We're going to do the meat chicken kebab in Euro and then another chicken kebab
6425.52s:  Money things spot on thank you for the reminder. We're going to look at this lawsuit
6430.16s:  Otherwise money things I don't think would ever forgive me and I wouldn't blame them
6434.80s:  Because we're supposed to look at this so let's take a look
6438.72s:  All right, and then hw we definitely can take a look at that
6447.60s:  Okay, so for this lawsuit
6450.88s:  This is the wrong one that's kind of annoying
6454.40s:  Let me grab the actual lawsuit
6458.08s:  We'll do BCG lawsuit first BCG GME lawsuit
6462.40s:  And what are we looking for in particular for this one for the BCG lawsuit let me get rid of that one
6473.84s:  In March BCG filed a lawsuit against GameStop for 30 million and unpaid fees
6479.28s:  GameStop said it refused to pay the fees because doing so was not the best interest. Oh shit
6489.04s:  Wow
6492.48s:  The case is still awaiting trial
6496.08s:  Wait, when did this this is old? Yo, this is annoying
6500.56s:  Give me the updated
6513.76s:  What is this this is memorandum of opinion we can take a look at this
6518.88s:  What's the view says the update is they dropped the case yeah, that's what I thought that's why it's wondering I was like why is this so old?
6527.04s:  Let's take a look through here
6531.92s:  And see what they say in the case filed by plaintiff BCG defendant GameStop presently pending before the court motion to partially dismiss
6541.76s:  The operative second amended complaint with prejudice filed pursuant to this
6548.56s:  For the reason set forth below the motion is granted in part and denied in part
6555.92s:  Okay, so let me zoom this in
6561.44s:  Show me show me's wait no, give me fucking wider window why are you doing this to oh Jesus
6572.08s:  No
6574.48s:  Can you guys see this okay if not I can download it really quick
6579.76s:  But I can't zoom it in any more than that
6585.04s:  Okay, cool. Thank you roaring titty
6588.16s:  All right, so it says the court rates briefly here for the parties who are well familiar
6593.84s:  Uh, it does so part of March
6598.00s:  Shhh
6600.80s:  Oh
6602.00s:  Which address the defendant's previously filed motion to the to dismiss the first amended the first amended complaint the fact
6612.40s:  And it does so by making use of the familiar standard for assessing rule
6616.08s:  Which is they're using they're sharing the reference case here
6619.52s:  And by considering the same stuff
6621.76s:  There's only one count in the SAC for breach of contract made pursuant to Delaware law
6628.08s:  The court will briefly explain why it agrees that count one can go forward pass the pleading stage in many respects
6638.64s:  All right
6642.32s:  In March 29 mo the court explained that the plaintiff had sufficiently set out a claim in the fact
6651.12s:  For failure to pay a certain variable fee rate for the s of w
6655.20s:  Um
6658.16s:  Now in the set there's a number of allegations that the court interprets is being related to these type to agreement breach allegations
6667.60s:  Defendant breached its duty to negotiate in good faith regarding those matters among others court reads plaintiffs allegations
6677.28s:  Um
6679.28s:  The many other initiatives discussed at the 2021 thermometer meetings is being this kind of type two agreement claim
6687.12s:  It reads the allegations in paragraph there
6690.64s:  As also being generally directed to this type two claim the court does not understand defendant to be
6696.24s:  Challenging the SACs type two
6698.40s:  Reach allegations and so those allegations survive here
6702.40s:  The court reads plaintiffs allegations in paragraph 41 and 45 is being about a different type of breach of contract claim
6709.44s:  A claim that defendant breached the s of w by failing to pay certain variable fee okay
6716.88s:  The initiatives referred to these paragraphs yep, okay
6722.00s:  Defendant moves to dismiss plaintiffs breach of contract claim relating to those agreed initiatives
6727.36s:  It does so on the ground that the SAC does not sufficiently allege that all the parties are actually reached a written agreement
6733.52s:  Okay
6736.00s:  Uh
6738.08s:  Pyros is what's the date on this one this one is from
6745.52s:  13 feb
6747.28s:  So this is before the dismissal what I'm doing right now is I'm just kind of understanding the background behind this
6753.60s:  because
6755.20s:  I'm trying to understand more of the the conversation and like what the what the basis was for the
6763.28s:  argument from the beginning
6767.36s:  However defendant does have a winning argument on another ground as the breach allegations regarding three initiatives
6774.48s:  That is because plaintive affirmatively pleads
6777.28s:  That as to these initiatives defendant only agreed in writing as to portions of profit improvement projections relating to EPPI
6786.48s:  S-w-requires that the parties reach written agreement on the amounts of credits to be made to each for each initiative
6792.72s:  So it sounds like a con uh
6795.52s:  Reach of contract which is really fascinating
6801.92s:  With the foregoing reason the court concludes that the defendant's motion should be granted in part denied in part more specifically
6807.12s:  It's granted with prejudice to the plaintiffs claims breach of contract
6811.52s:  It is denied in all other respects
6814.24s:  Interesting
6815.20s:  The cvos says they weren't paying for bad consult that's fascinating to me because
6820.00s:  I mean I worked at Deloitte for a while and I've worked around bcg and that they're they're a good consultancy
6827.68s:  So I'm actually kind of really curious
6830.96s:  why
6832.32s:  Like what the deal actually is because my guess is again, I don't think that
6838.00s:  They didn't I would find it really hard to believe that they didn't do shit
6842.32s:  My guess is they might have dubbed done stuff that they didn't like
6846.72s:  And that I get like that's okay
6849.76s:  But that's a different context at least in my opinion I don't know well enough
6855.36s:  But
6856.64s:  That's part of at least what what what I think all right, so let's take a look at this
6863.52s:  um
6865.52s:  Pursuant to and this one is from the 30th
6869.52s:  Under side parties here. I stipulate dismissal of this action with prejudice. Yes. So with prejudice here matters
6877.20s:  Yeah
6879.20s:  So this looks like they are
6882.00s:  Done and done
6890.00s:  Cool
6892.00s:  So money tings this looks
6894.96s:  This looks great. This looks like it was dismissed with prejudice. So it looks like the the whole thing from
6903.60s:  bcg will be
6906.32s:  Kind of flattened out which is good. It's good that that's not looming over their heads anymore
6911.36s:  Which is kind of a bummer
6913.36s:  To have to operate within at least I think
6918.40s:  And then we got a couple minutes left
6920.80s:  I know that there was another case you wanted me to look at but I think somebody also wanted me to look at some
6928.08s:  That's options in shui so I'm not as worried about that to be honest
6931.92s:  We can take a look
6934.48s:  Money things big now our seat tells what he wants to do with the money
6939.12s:  uh
6940.40s:  I guess the part I'm curious about is like what do you mean now he can tell us what he's gonna do with the money
6948.16s:  I don't understand
6950.24s:  I don't understand the way that you're attaching
6953.28s:  this case to the plans for the money
6957.84s:  I don't totally follow that because the the value of this case is still it's only 30 million dollars
6963.60s:  And they have way more cash than that. So even if this case came through and they were made to pay
6969.76s:  They still would pay
6972.48s:  Uh a fraction of their cash. So it's not like they were hiding their money. They know that the money's there
6978.24s:  so i
6980.32s:  Maybe there's more to it than I know I typically assume that with a lot of things
6985.28s:  But based on that I don't actually see
6990.00s:  The attachment here
6993.92s:  Money team says I guess I'm just saying why make moves when you got lost oh well, it's because companies almost always have lawsuits ongoing
7000.48s:  That's like standard fair man. Yeah. Okay. I understand what you're saying now
7004.32s:  I I personally would decouple those
7006.72s:  I don't think that the lawsuit really has anything to do whatsoever with what they're choosing to do with that capital or not choosing to do with that capital
7014.72s:  You have to understand like large companies a lot of these companies literally have
7019.52s:  built in
7021.04s:  lawyers that work for them directly that's called in house counsel and it's because there's so much litigation always
7028.80s:  So if a company essentially waited to do things until there was never any legal problems whatsoever
7034.96s:  They they would make zero headway nothing would ever happen
7038.00s:  So I get your point and it definitely is good right it's just one less piece of bullshit to deal with
7043.12s:  but
7044.32s:  I don't actually think
7046.48s:  at least this one um
7049.12s:  Matters too much in terms of what they were going to do with that money
7052.96s:  Uh money team says I think bby 16 b case tomorrow is way bigger. Let's see
7059.68s:  gme bbby
7062.64s:  16 b
7064.96s:  lawsuit
7072.08s:  Uh, this one is from routers
7075.04s:  Let's see
7080.40s:  Uh, Matthew says I think bcg at a cost for commission on gme profit so that was a big deal
7086.24s:  I don't actually again like I see what you're saying
7089.20s:  The way that that would work is they would have to then value whatever it is
7093.20s:  I think the point being is
7094.80s:  Whatever the fees that they charged and whatever commissions that they were trying to go after it still would be a general
7101.28s:  Uh, like drop in the bucket. It wouldn't be to the same degree
7106.08s:  As I think like a massive problem for the cash pile that they had just built and the other thing is it very rarely is done
7113.68s:  V is some sort of large cash payment. There's normally a payment plan
7117.60s:  So there's just a lot of
7118.88s:  Ancillary details around that
7120.96s:  That again, it's good that it's gone. I'm not arguing that it's not good that it's gone. I'm happy that it's gone
7127.12s:  But I just don't necessarily think that it's a absolutely massive impact on things
7136.48s:  All right, let's see
7139.04s:  So we won the dismissal on Tuesday
7141.60s:  Accusing a hymn of profitably cashing out of bedbath and beyond shares too quickly
7146.32s:  As it was hurting towards bankruptcy
7149.04s:  Said that two
7151.04s:  former shareholders could not force Cohen to return profits selling his estimated 11% stake
7157.36s:  Because the bankruptcy mooted their claims
7160.80s:  Shareholders sued Cohen under federal law requiring corporate insiders to including large shareholders to give up their short swing profits
7168.64s:  From buying and selling companies stocking a six-month period
7173.36s:  Um
7176.72s:  The client and media comment reviewing the decision
7181.52s:  Cohen declined
7184.64s:  So this talks about what he did he abruptly sold his stake
7188.88s:  Which had grown because of buybacks five months later he sold for 60 million profit
7198.64s:  Um
7208.88s:  So
7210.64s:  This doesn't tell me why one though
7213.60s:  Which I'm kind of curious about like what what the decision was
7217.60s:  EBBB Y Ryan
7220.88s:  Owen lawsuit
7224.32s:  Oh, it's a hearing tomorrow. I see okay
7226.96s:  Got it
7236.96s:  June 26
7243.52s:  So this one whoa
7251.44s:  This one's kind of interesting
7257.36s:  Um was concerned that some of her fellow director shared insider information before he dumped his stake
7265.52s:  That's interesting. That's a really interesting angle to take to
7276.64s:  Um the agency hasn't levied claims of wrongdoing
7282.32s:  A group suit them for fraud
7285.28s:  Yeah
7290.32s:  The board member worried about information leaks didn't trust Cohen
7293.76s:  Downed the credibility that Cohen backed to join the board
7302.56s:  Interesting yeah really interesting
7308.16s:  I do think that that one probably would be a slightly bigger deal just from Cohen's perspective because
7314.32s:  I mean there's no way that that doesn't impact his movement somehow
7318.00s:  so
7320.00s:  Justin says concerned about potential wrongdoing well the problem is is again
7324.24s:  It's that's not going to be the argument
7326.56s:  The the people who bring these arguments are pretty smart so they would have at least something pretty logical built
7336.08s:  Like this here right the suit accuses Cohen of insider trading and misleading investors about his trading plans
7342.32s:  It doesn't allege specific piece of non public information
7345.60s:  But says is allies in the board push to give him more information about strategy and critical financing options according to the internal emails
7353.04s:  So like this will be the the suit right it's it's not going to be concerned about potential wrongdoing
7358.16s:  They're actually going to come they're going to try to come with some heat
7360.96s:  Otherwise it wouldn't even get to this point
7364.80s:  Before something goes to trial a judge has to look at it and see if it's even you know worth worthwhile for them to take it
7371.36s:  So my guess is this this is happened
7375.04s:  So let's take a look
7378.08s:  All right gang that wraps me up for tonight another super fun session
7382.24s:  I love doing these with you guys and dive in deep into this absolutely enjoyable
7387.60s:  Tomorrow is options trading for beginners. We have a couple really fun things lined up before
7393.28s:  I punch out for a little bit of time off and then like I said
7398.16s:  I will be back in action with live stream starting the 11th of august you can catch me there
7405.68s:  Being outlier being ape
