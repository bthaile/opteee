0.00s: All right, man, we are on. What's up, Chris?
3.70s: Not much. How's it going?
5.58s: Absolutely. Great. I don't know if I told you my, uh, my brother's name is Chris.
8.98s: Is it except I call him Sasquatch. Um, he's
12.94s: a little bit. Yeah, he's a big old dude. I mean, I'm not small. I'm like six foot
18.32s: to 20-ish and he just dwarfs me. He's like six, three, you know, two, six,
23.68s: two, oh, most he's just big old boy. So I call him Sasquatch. He's not very hairy though.
27.54s: It's like a heralous Sasquatch.
29.42s: Amen. Anything you do to get a more unique name, I think I'm all more one of the name Chris
34.28s: Butler and my first and last name are literally both in the top, like 100 most common first
40.70s: names and last name. Oh, really? I can't, I can't get a unique username anywhere. There's
44.70s: no username where I could get Chris. Oh, yeah. I have to, you know, either you can
49.90s: first or do something that's a little bit more unique and not use my, my first and last
55.42s: name so. Yeah, you got to be like Chris Butler 99 or. Yeah, exactly. I usually, like
60.98s: my Instagram was Chris Butler 22. My email, I have an email that just basically has my
67.12s: birthday after. Uh-huh. I don't get it. I don't get Chris Butler at Gmail is. I love that.
75.62s: So also funny caveat on that in the Marine Corps, I was the only Eric R.I.K. Smolinsky,
83.54s: except I don't know why, but instead of just giving me Eric dot Smolinsky at usmc.mil,
89.90s: keep it just my name, they made it Eric dot M, which is my middle initial dot Smolinsky
95.58s: at you. Why, why would I make this so long, man? I already got a long, long last name.
99.70s: Now we got to have the middle, yeah, why? Cool, man. So obviously, super stuck to have you
105.70s: on the channel, like we were just talking about, I gave you some context on why I'm doing
109.02s: this, you know, just the general background and whatnot. And, you know, anybody who's willing
112.98s: to come on and just, you know, share some time with us is honestly super awesome. I get
117.94s: a tremendous amount of super positive feedback from the folks that frequent my channel, you
122.54s: know, just saying that they're having fun learning and seeing other stuff. So obviously,
125.78s: thank you for that. Um, I thought obviously good places start off would be learning a little
131.06s: bit about you, you know, we didn't dig too far into your background. I know you from Chicago
134.94s: with Denver. Um, but I would love to, you know, dig in your background a little bit.
139.38s: What got you into investing? When did you start? It's a good place to start. Um, so it's
144.98s: a good question because my freshman year, when I went to college, my initial major was
150.78s: computer science. Okay. And that's because when I was in high school, I played a lot of
155.18s: video games and I, for any computer. So I thought that I wanted to do something with computers.
161.06s: And I also have a very technical mind, which it's no surprise that translates into options
167.02s: or suit and a lot of moving parts. Um, but my initial major was computer science. And I
172.62s: went to Arizona State. Okay. And then about a party school, it is a party school. Okay. I did
179.18s: my fair share of party, but I did not leave ASU because I couldn't handle the party. I did
183.98s: have friends, however, that they dropped out of ASU because of the farging. It is couldn't handle
190.54s: it. Um, but after my first year at ASU, I kind of, I decided to transfer to Nepal, which is in
198.14s: Chicago. And when I, prior to doing that move, I decided that I wanted to change my major to finance.
205.02s: And I can't explain exactly the moment that's happened, but it was literally just like a weird
211.26s: moment of my life where I woke up one day and my whole mindset was shifted towards finance.
216.86s: And I was just like, I need to know how money works. I need to figure out how investing works.
220.46s: Yeah. Because it doesn't matter what kind of money I make in my life. Like if I don't know
225.42s: what to do with it or the things that I can do with it to grow it and preserve it, then I'm
230.22s: going to be screwed. Yeah. So I literally had like an overnight moment where I saw it from
234.94s: computer science to finance, transfer to the Paul and the rest of his history. So when I was at the
242.38s: Paul, I got an internship at Tasty Trade, which is a, I don't know where to talk about options
248.70s: trading and stuff like that. Got it. But I was just in email correspondence with the founder,
253.98s: Tom Sawzna. And I mean, I think her swim, right? Yeah. He's co founder, I think co founder of
260.78s: Tinker Swim. Got any other co founder that started to think her swim with them is at Tastyworks
265.74s: now. Got it. So the CEO of Tastyworks got shared and he and Tom were the, I think co founders
272.06s: of Tinker Swim. They definitely both worked there. I'm just not sure if there was another founder.
276.62s: But, but yeah, so I just was in email with him. I sent him a couple emails. One was about
282.78s: just an options trading question. And then I sent him another email that was asking about internships
289.34s: within the finance slash trading industry. I wasn't even necessarily asking for an internship
294.94s: at Tasty Trade. But he just kind of skimmed that email, I think. And then he sent me back another
300.54s: email saying that they had some interns there that would be in a couple months. And so he connected
306.62s: me with this other woman that worked at Tasty Trade. I sent her my resume came in for an interview,
312.94s: which was literally just kind of like a meet degree to see. Right. Just personalities. Yeah,
317.74s: exactly. Yeah. Like the hardest question he asked me, he said, how are your math skills? And I was
323.42s: like, I don't know, I think they're pretty good. Like that was the most, that was the most technical
327.18s: question. I think the interview process is a little harder these days, but I definitely got super
331.82s: lucky with that. But it was just kind of a cold email led into an internship. And I worked at Tasty
339.02s: Trade for three years from 2013 to 2016. And then after my stint there, I left to start project
348.78s: option, which the initial goal was to start a website, have a lot of written content,
354.54s: grow the website traffic, and then sell subscription services or courses on that. But then it kind
360.70s: of morphed into a YouTube channel because I knew that it would be easier to get exposure on YouTube
366.46s: as compared to Google search. Because when you think about the two, there's like, there's, when I
371.74s: started, there was already probably hundreds of websites that had lots of our options trading articles,
377.50s: and they're, it was really hard to compete with them. But when you looked at the YouTube space,
381.66s: there were only really a couple of channels that had lots of viewers. So I thought that it would be
388.14s: a much easier time getting exposure on YouTube as compared to just the written content.
393.74s: Since there are less people making videos as compared to the blog post type content. So
399.26s: and that kind of led to where I am today. So today I'm just focused essentially 100% on YouTube.
405.74s: Okay. It's funny because when I started the YouTube channel, I saw it as a tour. Like I wanted
411.50s: to focus on the website and the written content. Interesting. But I knew that the YouTube channel
416.54s: would be a much easier way to get exposure, at least at your e. And so I created written or video
422.94s: counterparts to all the blog posts that I was writing. Okay. And my like my OG day one YouTube video
428.62s: is we're all just horrible like voice over presentation. Like I would have, I would just be doing
434.38s: sitting here at this microphone. Yeah. And I would make a PowerPoint presentation. I would export
439.58s: the slides as images. And then there would be times where I would be talking over like the same
444.30s: slide for two minutes. And it would be like all this text like sitting static. And then me
450.38s: talking for two minutes. Like which looking back at that, I can't believe I even drew on YouTube
454.94s: with that format because on YouTube engagement is everything. And so these days when I make videos
460.54s: like I'm always trying to have something moving just to keep the viewer engaged visually.
464.86s: You must have really good content though. I mean at the end of the day, if that was making you
468.78s: grow even with the you know the clear overhead front on the projector thing that goes. Yeah.
473.26s: Yeah. You know. I think I think yeah, I think the original growth or the growth that I experience
480.54s: over the first couple of years, even with the less engaging video format. I think it was just the
485.74s: bottom of the back end. Not necessarily production quality. Yeah. But I identify honestly a lot with
491.98s: that because I put zero effort into my production quality. And I think everybody knows that. I mean
497.26s: I tell it to people like this is a lot of work. What's that? It's a lot of work. Yeah. And for me,
504.86s: like I was telling you, I do not identify as a creative person. So for me to like I like to use
509.90s: the whiteboard. I just jot out my thoughts and whatnot, talk through them and share screenshots.
514.30s: And for me, that's not work. For me, that's just how I mentally process things. But if I were to do
519.50s: with some of the other channels, do which is really Gucci, like it looks cool. But to me, that's work.
524.14s: I'm not graphically inclined. So that's what I also attribute. The, you know, very humble growth
530.86s: that my channel has had is essentially just because the content comes from a good, a good place.
535.74s: And I know that because I'm not selling anything. I couldn't fucking care if you like it or not.
539.74s: It's just there for general consumption. But that's really interesting. I'd love to hear a little
544.54s: bit more about the switch from the focus on your website to YouTube. When did you make that jump?
552.54s: I think, let's see. So I think 2019 was the first year. This was a literal,
560.30s: recent resolution. I had a business New Year's resolution.
564.30s: That's awesome.
565.02s: Coming into 2019, I said, for the entirety of 2019, I'm doing nothing on the website. I'm focusing
571.98s: all of my energy on making my video is better. So higher production quality. Also,
577.34s: I kind of like the post production of doing animations and graphics and stuff like that,
582.70s: which the first couple iterations of that were absolutely terrible. But for 2019, that was the first
588.86s: year. And it was a literal business New Year's resolution to spend all of my energy and focus on
595.42s: YouTube because I'm a one man show. And so for me, especially like I can be, I'm so prone to
602.06s: procrastination and being easy and focused like, there's no way I could have a podcast, a YouTube
608.54s: channel, right blog posts and do all that at the same time. I just have to focus on one thing.
614.46s: And I think, well, I know. So the reason that I that I chose to focus on YouTube for that year
620.94s: is because up to that point, YouTube was kind of like the steady growth curve. So like,
626.06s: whenever I looked at the analytics, it was steadily growing. And compared to my website analytics,
632.06s: you know, it was it was kind of choppy. It wasn't it wasn't growing exponentially like YouTube was.
638.22s: And so I figured the highest probability bet that I could make would be to focus 100% of my effort
645.10s: on the one thing that I know is growing. And if I focus more on that, and especially if I improve
650.78s: the quality of my videos, then I think I can kind of pour gasoline on that growth. So it's the
655.34s: yeah, yeah, that's what I did. That's absolutely awesome. I love that because I also had a blog for a
660.78s: little while that was just, you know, general hobby. And what I realized is I was talking to some of
664.86s: my friends, nobody wanted to sit there and fucking read it. You know what I mean? And one of the things
669.50s: people really enjoy about YouTube is that if they're doing something else and they want to partially
674.46s: pay attention, it's available to them. They can just let it run and, you know, digest what they hear.
679.34s: And if they want to go back and like really focus on it, I think it's really awesome that you did
682.70s: that and you kind of identified that obviously, you're really savoring it. It comes to identify
687.66s: business opportunities. That's super awesome. When you first started, general question,
691.82s: did it still feel like a chore working on YouTube slash? And I'm asking for me, obviously,
696.62s: my viewers, they don't care. But I'm curious personally, like when did it start feeling like
701.26s: fun for you to work on YouTube channel compared to the website? That's a good question. I honestly can't,
709.02s: I can't pinpoint a specific moment. But I think, I think just generally after I started YouTube
716.86s: and I started seeing, because the YouTube analytics are absolutely insane, as I'm sure you know.
722.78s: I'd say what, man, I'm too dumb to use it. I literally have one of my best friends.
727.42s: You only need to focus on a couple of things. YouTube, they kind of guide you and show you
732.86s: that when you log in, watch times, the first thing they should do. It's all about watch time.
738.62s: But I think it was after I had maybe a few months experience, probably about a year experience,
743.90s: because in my first six months, I think I added maybe three to four hundred subscribers.
749.58s: And then second six months, I added maybe a thousand, 1500. So like every,
756.30s: every interval of time or chunk of time, like going forward was exponential in terms of growth
762.38s: compared to this same amount of time in previous history. So like the first months was 300
767.74s: subscribers the next six months were 1000 subscribers or whatever it is. And it just continued
774.30s: to grow exponentially. And so once I started to see those trends, I think I became much more interested
780.22s: in YouTube. And then I think after I turned on monetization, because I actually, I didn't turn on
785.02s: monetization or ads on my videos right when it was available to me. I think I actually, because I
791.26s: assumed that the money that was going to be made from my YouTube channel would be so low that
798.14s: it wouldn't even matter. And then I was surprised when I turned on monetization. I was like,
802.70s: oh, this is actually like my first, my first paycheck from YouTube was like a couple hundred bucks.
807.90s: Yeah. So like, well, that's a pretty substantial amount of money, because at the time,
812.38s: my first year, when I started project option, I made $10,000.
817.34s: And the second year was more than that, but it still wasn't like, it wasn't a lot of money.
822.06s: Right. Right. So $300 in one month in my first paycheck from YouTube, like that was a good amount
828.14s: of money. Yeah, that's decent. So I was super surprised to see the amount of money that could be made
832.94s: from monetization. And so that also started to get me more and more interested. And I love that
839.02s: is for people who maybe have no idea about YouTube ad revenue and stuff like that.
843.66s: It's very niche dependent. So like if you have a YouTube channel and you are getting like
850.78s: tens of millions of views on all of your videos, then that means you have a very broad audience.
856.06s: Right. Basically, you're catering to everyone. You just have you just have viral YouTube content
860.62s: that everybody wants to watch. But for advertisers, if you have a really broad audience,
866.62s: then there's not going to there's not going to be as much competition to actually target a
871.50s: specific audience because they can't use your channel to really get to the audience they want.
876.22s: Right. But in something like finance, since all the people who are watching
880.22s: options trading videos or investing videos, that's a much more specific audience.
885.58s: And the lifetime value of acquiring a customer and finance is thousands of dollars.
891.82s: Right. And so if you can, if you can acquire that customer and make those thousand dollars,
897.58s: in some case, tens of thousands of dollars over the lifetime of that customer, then you can
902.30s: naturally spend hundreds of dollars to acquire a customer. Right. And so since the lifetime value
907.66s: of the customer is higher in finance and investing, then you can pay more to acquire the customer.
912.94s: And so advertising competition and advertising spend is a lot higher in finance as it would be in
921.74s: something that's much more broad where you can't figure out the audience. And so that trick
925.98s: goes down to the YouTube creator because YouTube takes a percentage of what the advertisers pay
933.26s: to advertising the channel and then you as the creator get the rest. So yeah, that's it's,
938.54s: I mean, that's educational for me. I honestly didn't know a lot of that because I was in the same
941.90s: boat as you where I didn't bother turning on monetization for some time. And then I was talking to
946.06s: somebody about it and they were like, dude, why don't you just turn it on because they know I work
950.06s: with the Wounded Warrior project. No, why don't you just turn it on and donate it? And I was like,
954.06s: yeah, you know, I'm not sure I thought the same thing is going to be really low, who really cares.
957.90s: And then he's just like, dude, think of it this way. It's no sweat off of the viewers back.
962.06s: Like it makes no difference. The content you're providing is still completely free to them. So
966.06s: you're not, you know what I mean? You're not changing that paradigm that I kind of built my channel
971.18s: on. And he's like, and then you just, you know, it's passive, like just donate it. I was like, yeah,
975.42s: okay. And then I found the semi-sac thing as you were talking about. I was surprised
980.54s: with the ad revenue. It's actually really cool because I was able to make a donation that was
988.30s: for building a ramp out of dude's house that was in a wheelchair. He literally sent a video
994.06s: to one of the segments of him getting in his house because it had stairs. And he literally
998.46s: would roll the wheelchair backwards until he hit the stairs and like muscle himself up for stairs.
1004.70s: And he was good at it. But we're like, you know what we could probably get this dude a ramp.
1008.70s: So it doesn't have to play that game. So it's fascinating that background you shared because like
1013.58s: you said, ignorant all of it. You know nothing. So that's cool man. So like all these little things
1018.38s: that I was learning about, especially like as they pertain to YouTube, all these things together,
1023.58s: they really pulled me in. I was like, okay, if I could focus on this and if I put in the effort
1029.26s: then maybe one day like this could be all I need. Right. Yeah. I'm happy that I'm able to make
1037.50s: a full-time living from YouTube and also the affiliate marketing that I do which is just
1041.90s: essentially connecting people with a brokerage firm because now my business model doesn't require
1047.66s: anybody that's watching my videos. It doesn't require them to pay me right out of the pocket
1052.30s: for me to make money. And so you know there's obviously a lot of in the trading and investing
1057.66s: industry. It's very predatory. I hate it. Where fucking hate it. These people they line their pockets
1063.74s: from other people who are paying them that just don't know any better. And they sell them on the
1069.10s: material things which you know that was like from day one when I started project option. I was like
1074.54s: I'm going to take the long road and I'm never going to I'm not going to succumb to you know selling
1079.66s: the dream to sell my business or whatever because number one that's not reality. Like these people
1085.10s: they're making they could be making that amount of money from their trading accounts. But it's very
1092.06s: unlikely that they grew small trading accounts which is most of their customers will have a thousand
1098.62s: dollars into millions of dollars. That's like very far in between. But once they have that experience or
1105.74s: they have the proof that they actually did that however they were successful in doing so. Then they
1111.18s: can use that to sell a subscription service or a course. And then the money that comes from that
1116.78s: can grow their trading account even further. And then they have the steady just steady flow of cash flow
1123.10s: that they can use to make riskier and risk your bets. And some of those could pay off. But for the
1128.46s: average person that is going to start with a couple thousand dollars. It's just not it's not a realistic
1134.22s: way to market your stuff. And so my goal with project option was to just kind of present things
1140.70s: neutrally and get people the information and let them use it however they want to. But I never
1145.50s: wanted to use the flashy sales tactics for the purpose of selling things that would line my own
1152.38s: pockets. I love that. So I'm happy that the ad revenues are high enough on YouTube for the
1157.98s: options trading space and finance in general. Because I can structure a business model around that
1163.50s: where I don't have to actually collect payments from the customers. Yeah. Have them pay out of pocket.
1169.66s: Yeah. That's awesome. Man. And to be honest, it's one of the things that I do before I invite
1174.38s: anybody to chat on my channel. Not like again, not like I'm offering any sort of significant exposure.
1180.14s: But do you know that folks are looking for resources and stuff? And I want nothing to do with any
1186.22s: of those kind of channels because it's just misleading. It brings people down the wrong path. I literally
1191.82s: just started a I call it a small stacks portfolio. So I just took 5k, opened up a small portfolio,
1198.94s: and I'm essentially trading it, knowing what I know now as if I was starting all over again.
1204.78s: And what I tell everybody is that this 5k is not going to grow into my nest egg. Like this 5k
1210.46s: is something that I think if I was starting over again, that I would be wanting to grow modestly,
1216.62s: but most importantly, developing a solid strategy that as my income grows and as I continue to save
1222.94s: and grow the account, I can continue to apply that same strategy, earning that whatever that percent
1228.30s: return is. So it's like that 5k is for developing a strategy in consistency that is not going to
1234.86s: grow in your nest egg. And I honestly love that you kind of echo that because it's so exhausting,
1241.26s: seeing all the bullshit that people are spreading. And then it's no wonder why when there's new people
1245.82s: to come into investing, they're like, you ask them, hey, you know, what are you what are you
1249.82s: targeting this year? They're like, oh, you know, nothing crazy, maybe 80, 100% for the year.
1254.30s: And it's like, oh, God, like just you're completely lost. You're so skewed in what you think is
1260.86s: realistic. Yeah, some people, some people email me and they ask me for my opinion on a service or
1268.06s: whatever, not to name anything. And most of the time, like I've never heard of it myself, but
1274.78s: just the other day, someone asked me and they said, well, this service, they said that they can turn
1278.70s: $5,000 into $200,000 every year. I was like, well, obviously, like that's not true because
1287.74s: they may have done it once, but if they could do it every single year, then there would be no reason
1293.10s: to sell that because they would be a trillion. If you could turn $5,000 into 200K every single year,
1298.38s: and you could scale that strategy, there would be no reason to be in online sales. You could just,
1303.82s: you could become a billionaire with that. Right. Sure. You know, so Epstein's Island and then just stay
1309.58s: there. Yeah, exactly. And then like I've had, I've had people email me pictures from other newsletters
1317.98s: or trade-alert services where like in their introductory newsletter that they're using to kind of
1323.66s: try to sell people on it, where they'll say like with just $2,000 on a margin account, like you can
1329.18s: make a full-time living trading options like psychotic. It's just absolute bullshit. So it's
1334.38s: psychotic. It's unfortunate that that's the space we're in. I feed it. But yeah, like when I started,
1342.46s: I knew that not taking that approach to marketing and selling would be a much slower path, but it was
1349.98s: just so important to me to not go down that path. It's so awesome. It's so awesome. I wouldn't be
1355.18s: able to live with myself, which is different types of people that because the person that can do
1359.82s: anything and do any type of sales that they want to as long as it benefits them. And they don't care,
1365.58s: like what that means ethically. And then there's the other type of person that will refuse certain
1371.74s: approaches if it's not ethical. You know, I'm just type of person. So I always try to be, I always
1379.10s: try to be brutally honest. And my whole goal is just to give people information, unbiased, and let
1385.74s: them do with the information whatever they want. I love that. Yeah, it's honestly when I was, I
1392.62s: looked at a couple of your videos before I asked you to come on and do this with me. And that's one
1398.86s: thing I truly look for is the people who are genuinely trying to just share information and then
1406.54s: let individuals do what they're going to do with it. But something that is definitely clouded
1413.34s: the space is just predatory live advertising. You see it all the time and it sucks because it's so
1418.94s: effective. So many people just want that lifestyle so bad that when they see something that you know
1426.30s: it's fishy, but you want it so bad that you want to believe it. And then you find yourself going
1431.34s: down this, you know, really shitty path. Yeah. Right. So when you started investing, what, what was
1438.86s: your primary vehicle? Did you start with stock and go to options? Or do you start with options?
1444.14s: What did that look like? Yeah, so I started when I read a lot of books just on general stock
1450.38s: investing. So I read basically all of Peter Lynch's books. He's famous mutual fund manager and
1456.38s: who worked for fidelity. He had like 30% returns for 15, 20 years, whatever, whatever his
1463.58s: period of time working there, he has like some of the most historic returns ever for mutual fund
1468.86s: managers. So I read all of his books essentially. I read a couple books by Jim Kramer. I was just
1475.50s: kind of, I was just absorbing as much information as I could within the stock investing space.
1482.54s: And naturally from there going down rabbit holes on the internet, I found options. And I think
1487.98s: I found options articles from the Motley pool. And I was like, these things are interesting. Like,
1493.66s: I don't know what this is about, but this sounds really appealing. And like admittedly, the appeal
1499.74s: of options that drew me in was that you could use a small amount of money. There it is.
1503.50s: Automotive. You know, so that really drew me in. And then I started searching for options content
1512.62s: on YouTube. And then I found Tason Trade. And then that's kind of what led me to email Tom. And
1518.54s: then I had the internship at Tason Trade and then started project option obviously. So yeah,
1523.82s: I started in stocks, transitioned into options. But at the time. So this must have been in 20,
1533.82s: this was probably early 2013. Okay. So I was 20 years old. So I didn't have a lot of money to
1542.14s: invest at that time. So I was basically just learning as much as I could. And just this absorbing all
1548.54s: the content. So yeah, that's awesome. I started with stock myself. And then I stumbled across
1556.14s: options in a kind of similar way. I started early though. I started trading options in
1562.62s: when I was a senior in high school. So 2009. And I was super fortunate in that there was no,
1572.62s: like, internet was still kind of like growing then. Obviously it existed. But it wasn't like
1576.86s: for information as it is now. And I was super fortunate. I came across a,
1583.90s: my mentor, I still talked to him today. But he's a prior army officer and what not, I met him
1589.98s: on a Facebook group. But long story short, if it wasn't for that dude to help me get started
1595.18s: when I was getting started, I probably would have just, you know, pissed on my money away. So I,
1600.14s: I find your approach very respectable because most people, myself included, want to get started
1607.58s: before they're ready to get started. And it seems like you did a lot of homework, which is,
1611.74s: honestly, it's just super admirable to hear that because most people are like me and they're
1616.54s: impulsive and they want to get started before they're ready. They want to start making money. And
1619.90s: then they just piss it away because they're not ready. So that's really awesome. Something I'm
1624.06s: curious about is if you were to like look at the lifespan of your options trading, how has it evolved
1631.42s: from when you started to how you trade now? That's a great question. So to kind of, to kind of
1641.18s: build on what you just said, while I did do a lot of reading and learning before I ever made
1647.98s: an option straight, I probably was reading about options for probably one or two months before
1653.82s: I even don't count and made my first trade. But the most, the most you're going to learn is going
1660.86s: to come from your direct experience. So it doesn't matter how many YouTube videos you watch, how many
1664.94s: book to read, how many blog posts you read, you're not going to learn how options work until you
1670.78s: actually start trading them with real money in my opinion because I, I messed around with paper
1675.74s: trading and I just never found it to be a valuable learning experience because I would, I would,
1682.06s: and this is, it's not true for everybody. Oh, sure. Yeah. Like I would put on an option position in
1687.10s: these simulated trading softwares and I would kind of just forget about them because I, I didn't
1693.42s: have any skin in the game and there was really nothing that was pulling me back to like monitor that
1699.74s: position. I'm just really focused on it. And so I didn't really find that it was a valuable
1705.34s: learning tool. Although if, if people use it like a real trade or a real position and they actually
1711.74s: like watch it. Yeah. A whole time today, checking on every day and then close it out. I think,
1717.42s: I think you can learn a lot from that. But I've always felt that real money trading is the
1723.42s: absolute best way to learn obviously with a small amount if you're just, yeah. But I agree with you.
1729.18s: Your experience trumps all. I totally agree with you. Regardless of what we're talking about. Yeah,
1733.74s: I totally agree with you. I think for me, I had the same exact perspective on paper trading for a
1740.94s: long time that was kind of useless. And then when I met my mentor, my opinion on paper trading
1746.70s: completely changed because he forced me to paper trade for six months straight. I couldn't,
1752.70s: he, I mean, I say I couldn't, I could have traded, right? He didn't fucking control my account. But
1757.74s: I really respected him and I didn't, I wanted to do, you know what I mean? What my mentor was
1762.78s: kind of telling me to do is he made me paper trade for six months straight. And he, we treated it
1770.22s: just like it was my money. Like we would talk about it every single day. We would talk about the
1774.78s: moves I wanted to make. I was only allowed to trade the amount of money I was going to, you know,
1778.86s: invest with stuff like that. And I found that to be so beneficial. And it came down exactly to
1786.06s: what you said. It's like having the no shit discipline to treat this like real money, to treat
1791.10s: this just like your account. And like you said, most folks, it's super hard to do that. I needed
1795.58s: somebody to force me to do it in order to take it seriously. So I totally identify with you that
1799.90s: for most people until you put actual money in the game. It's just not the same. And even so,
1805.82s: even like with me taking it as seriously as I did, it still isn't the same exactly like you said.
1810.06s: Like there is no replacement for actually trading. But what I do tell people is that if you're new,
1816.30s: I suggest so strongly to start with paper trading. Because I truly think that it can help you get
1822.14s: a lot of like just the gross fuck ups out of the way early. So you don't have to do that with real
1827.34s: money. I think that that's in just a really cool perspective that you were sharing because it's
1832.14s: something I talk a lot about is, you know, the disposition towards paper trading. I agree with that.
1837.58s: So to answer your question, how the trading evolved. Yeah. The early, like the first couple of years
1844.30s: that I was trading options. I was doing, I was very active. So I was probably trading every day
1851.10s: or as much as I could. And I was experimenting with lots of different strategies,
1856.70s: trading all the different strategies. I did a lot of naked option selling. So I loved selling
1862.22s: stringals early in the case. And that's because when you learn about option decay and positive
1868.86s: theta and everything like that, you naturally are gravitated towards selling straddles and
1874.62s: selling stringals because you don't have the long options that are reducing your option decay.
1880.22s: And so early in my options trading career, learn life span, whatever you want to call it. I was doing
1887.02s: a lot of naked options selling and just trading a lot of different strategies, making a lot of
1894.30s: predictions and speculations on stock price movements. But I think the most important part of
1899.82s: that whole thing is just experimenting with different strategies and paying attention to why
1906.22s: the positions are changing in terms of P and L every single day. So observations that you make
1914.70s: with your positions, I think are one of the best ways to learn because you have to ask yourself,
1921.26s: all right, the stock is down today and my position is up or the stock is flat today, my positions,
1926.38s: P and L has changed by why is this happening? And you have to ask yourself the why every single day
1932.46s: and after every single movement. And that's how you're going to learn how options work
1937.82s: truly in the real world. And so that was the first the first few years that's kind of how I approached it.
1944.94s: I was not really making money, I would say I was a break even trader at best, which is still I
1951.34s: think really good when you're starting out. If you can break even your first year, I think that's
1955.10s: all I really be honest been I tell everybody be profitable because your first year and you make a
1960.06s: dollar win. Yeah, you come out okay. Yeah, I may not have been breaking even, but it wasn't I never
1966.06s: had any catastrophic loss. Which I think is very common for beginners, especially if you're
1972.86s: getting into the short term option buying, which is something that a lot of people kind of
1977.18s: put out there these days because that's the only that's the only real way to have a 10,000 extra turn
1982.38s: is to buy out of the money options, super short term and be right on a big stock price movement.
1987.50s: Yep, that's the only way to have those home run type returns and people do hit them, but
1993.02s: that's the fastest way to blow up your whole account because you don't have any margin for error
1998.46s: and those options are not only going to decay very quickly, but if the stock price moves against
2004.06s: them, those options will also be worth it. I mean, you just sit there looking at a lot of gamma
2008.22s: risks. So it's yeah, it's as my I'm in a I'm in a Google chat with my brother and some other people
2017.50s: and we call it vapor risk vapor risk. So like if you buy short term out of the money options,
2022.94s: those are pure vapor. So that'll just gone. Yeah, I love that. That's absolutely accurate.
2029.58s: Yeah, and so that evolved into that evolved into basically transitioning from all the strategies
2038.70s: to mainly selling directionally neutral trades or doing spread trades directionally. So it's
2044.62s: basically just spreads, but it was either neutral or directional. Got it. Like iron condors, iron
2051.02s: butterflies or selling foot spreads selling pulse spreads, buying pulse spreads, buying
2055.18s: foot spreads. That's kind of where it went, but the activity was still pretty high. And if we fast
2063.02s: forward to probably the past year, I would say that my trading activity, my trading activity from day
2069.18s: one options trading like starting from when I started learning all the way to today, I think my
2075.02s: trading activity has been a steady decrease in current. That's awesome. I think that's because
2082.06s: I've realized that the more active I am, the worse I do. Because not necessarily just like
2089.66s: churning trades, but like your your micromanaging position and this actually happened earlier this
2094.94s: year in March when the market was so volatile, I got sucked into the volatility and I was
2101.18s: started to micromanage again. And every single day I was making a 10 to 15 trades. Yeah. And
2107.98s: I felt like I was just kind of digging myself and do a whole because I was never letting a
2112.14s: prediction play out. I was just kind of changing my predictions with each day with each new movement
2117.66s: in the market. And I found that to be a very difficult period trading wise. And it was also getting
2124.30s: super, super stressful. I started to lose sleep. I was waking up at four in the morning,
2129.82s: oh my, my phone to see where ES was. Yeah. So it just it wasn't like I had a ton of risk on it.
2136.70s: That's that's not why I was losing sleep. It was just because my brain had gotten into this pattern
2141.50s: of just being hyper obsessed with every little movement in the market. Yeah. It was hard to
2145.98s: lower the fame because every day the market was up or down. And so I was able to pair that back and
2156.38s: start putting on some directional positions, which after the Federal Reserve came out and came
2161.10s: out with all the stimulus. And then we rallied like 10% off the lows. And then we weren't started.
2167.82s: We weren't really seeing any negative downturns even after he's coming out. Then I kind of figured like
2173.82s: all right, I might as well just not try to fight this because after we started bouncing 5 10%
2178.94s: off the lows, I was like, all right, now is the time to start loading up on the shorts again.
2183.50s: And I burned a lot of money in VXX by purchasing deep out of the money calls and VXX because I thought
2189.90s: we could have another vol explosion with the obvious, the obvious incoming market crash. But we never
2197.18s: really got that. And then I also learned that typically when you have a shock to the system and you
2204.46s: have a really severe stock market crash, the volatility increases typically the most exaggerated on
2210.54s: the initial downturn. But then even if you rally back up and then you have another 10% drop,
2216.46s: like the second increase in volatility, primarily talking about the VIX, VIX futures, and therefore VXX,
2223.26s: that will not be as significant as the first typical meltdown. So like the initial shock is
2229.42s: typically the most jarring in terms of a volatility increase. Absolutely. The information that I
2235.90s: came across on the internet, which you always have to take with the great. Just to blindly obviously.
2241.10s: It does make sense when you think about it because like a couple months in like a month and a half
2246.38s: into the new volatility, like people are used to really bad news and people are used to a market
2251.98s: decrease. And therefore the reactions to those movements and the reactions to the news are not
2258.22s: going to be as exaggerated as when you go from a 12 VIX and then all of a sudden the market dropped
2263.98s: 30% in 17 trading days and now the VIX is at 90. I talk about that a lot too. I always like to say
2273.50s: markets crash down, not up. But once you get through that first move, exactly like you're talking,
2279.02s: people have had a chance to digest, synthesize the information. So even if there is a change in
2284.54s: circumstance, two months down the line or whatever, they've already hit that initial shock.
2291.50s: It's funny you bring that up because I truly have felt and I've said it a million times on
2295.98s: different videos that this has been one of the most emotional markets I've ever traded in.
2302.14s: I started trading really in 2007 and it's just been mind blowing to me just how emotional
2310.78s: every single thing feels to me. And it's also very fascinating to hear how you handled the rebound
2317.74s: compared to how I did because I absolutely shared your sentiment. I thought with near certainty
2326.30s: that there's no way the market could continue up after the initial rebound. But I didn't start playing
2333.42s: it because I felt like the move in the news I was seeing didn't make any sense. So I literally just
2341.10s: started scaling out. When the market makes typically those big down moves, that's when I end up
2348.46s: doing very well with the volatility starting to spike as much as it does. And then as soon as we
2354.30s: started getting that rally, I was like, I'll just kind of scale out and see how this plays out.
2358.54s: And then it just kept going and going. And I was like, what the fuck man? What is happening right now?
2364.70s: And especially the technology stocks. I was just crazy. And I was looking at
2370.70s: you know, just some studies on historical bear markets and from like 1920 or so the average
2377.18s: recovery is like 298 days or so. So over 200 days, almost 300. And I know that. And then as soon as I
2383.82s: started seeing this thing, you know, looking like a V shape, I was like, how, how, like how are we
2389.74s: making this move? I just didn't believe it. So I've been ever since the drop. I've been very
2395.66s: lightly invested. I've scaled in a bit more in different periods of time. But in general, I just
2400.54s: don't trust it, man. I just do not trust for things. Our technology has been doing well. And I think
2406.38s: in a lot of ways, this kind of environment boasts well for them. You know, everybody needs technology.
2411.26s: And I get that. But there's a lot of other, you know, makeup in the markets, not just technology. So
2418.38s: I have, I don't have a hard time with that. Being cognizant of our time, I definitely don't want to
2423.66s: run over. I really appreciate your time. I want to make sure that we have a few minutes to touch on
2428.54s: just your thoughts on how the mind of the trader impacts, you know, their execution, especially
2436.06s: in a time like we're seeing right now, you know, when things are so emotional. I'd let you get your
2440.22s: thoughts on that. Yeah. So I think I've personally realized and I structure my own
2447.74s: trading, philosophy and approach around psychology because I'm particularly sensitive to stress
2454.38s: and anxiety. And so if I, if I'm too active in the markets and like they're taking, it's taking
2461.26s: up too much of my mental space and especially like if I size trades too large or something like that
2468.06s: or I don't really know how I'm in a man in the position, then all those things can start to kind
2472.22s: of e-way at me. And so I try to structure my trading strategy so that I don't really have to
2478.30s: have those worries. And I think trader psychology is one of those things that it's not a sexy topic
2484.54s: to talk about because everybody is like if we, if we just sit here talking about trader psychology,
2489.82s: people will probably think, well, that doesn't really apply to me because it's really strong.
2494.38s: Always. And while that could be true, when you have your money on the line and especially once you
2500.06s: start to pay attention to the markets very actively, you'll find that the markets can break you
2504.62s: down pretty quickly. And I've learned through many of, I think I learned the most about my own
2511.34s: trader psychology and trader psychology in general through the big market crashes that we've experienced
2518.30s: over the past few years. Yeah. Namely, I started trading options in mid 2013. And 2015 was
2527.10s: extremely low, but 2014 was extremely low. And then we get to August 2015. And that's the first time
2535.02s: that I ever saw a high volatility market. And that's the first time I ever saw the floor being pulled
2541.50s: out from the stock market. Right. And so in 2015, I was trading with about $20,000. And from January to
2553.02s: August, I went up $10,000 again with a lot of naked options selling. I was selling lots of strangles.
2560.70s: But I was having a lot of success with options trading. And I was up 50% on the year. And then
2566.62s: August came around. And I lost all of my profits in like 36 hours or something like that. So,
2573.02s: because the market started to get so volatile that I initially got blown out, not like blown out in terms
2579.50s: of I blew out my whole account. But my short option positions to strangles those exploded in value
2586.38s: when the market opened on August 24th. Right. And I took some big losses on those. But then the futures
2592.70s: were moving around $100 a day. So then I was I was like, if I could just catch one of these movements,
2598.62s: then I could make $5,000 because 100 points on ES is $5,000. And so I started to get into active
2606.70s: futures trading. And that was like that pulled me in a very dark place psychologically because
2613.42s: you're looking at every single move. Right. And especially if you like I had my entries and then I
2618.14s: have my stops. And then it would always basically go right to my stop. I could stop down. And then the
2622.94s: move would happen. And I'd miss out on it. And then you'd start to force entries on things because
2628.06s: you're tired of waiting around. So it was just a very undisciplined period. And I started to get
2633.34s: really, really active, especially with the futures. And I just noticed that like I just got way,
2639.42s: way stressed out. And I was in a very dark place like it was not just it was not just affecting my
2646.38s: investing portfolio. Yeah. For like my investing life, it was like all the aspects of life I got very
2651.98s: sour and just I was in a not good place. So I actually when I got back to principle, which is my
2659.02s: $20,000. So I actually took all of that money out of my trading count. And I didn't trade for a month.
2665.42s: I didn't even open up my platform for a month. I was like, I need to reset from this. I can't just
2672.30s: go right back in there. Like I'm not in a good place mentally. And so that was my first big lesson
2678.46s: about trader psychology. And especially how volatile markets can can chew you up and spit you out.
2685.90s: To actually float my own boss. And I think a lot of people may agree with that because if you
2692.14s: if you've never experienced a volatile market and when you start to learn, you start actually trading
2696.94s: and getting involved in markets, just trickling higher. It's like, all right, low volatility,
2701.42s: the market just kind of grinds up over time. There's no real worry. Like I don't know why people are
2706.46s: scared of the declines and the drawdowns. And then it happens. And then you're like, oh, shit,
2712.14s: like this is this is how it feels. And this is what happens in my brain when I start to see so
2717.50s: much volatility. And also with volatility, you start to see all these opportunities. And so you
2723.26s: might get sucked into all these trades that you are probably just putting on just because of the
2729.34s: volatility. And you're thinking about if you can catch one of those huge moves for this particular
2734.62s: position, like you're going to be sitting pretty. But unfortunately, it's it's not that easy. And
2739.26s: volatile markets, I think, are the most dangerous, particularly for new traders because
2745.18s: just what happens psychologically when you're actively involved in the markets and then everything
2749.74s: just starts to get crazy volatile. I think that can that can really surprise you negatively
2757.10s: in terms of how you react to those environments. So especially the, you know, what I find when
2764.54s: there are people who are, you know, starting to think that they understand it and stuff like that.
2769.26s: I always talk to folks. My favorite conversation is when folks are selling cash secured puts and
2773.66s: they're always just like, oh, I'm okay with assignment. And then all of a sudden the underlying drops
2778.38s: and they're like, why don't I want to sign it here? And it's like, it's just what you're talking
2782.38s: about that it's what Mike Tyson always said, right? Everybody's got a plan to get punched in the face.
2786.94s: It's the same exact thing. Like so many people feel like they're in a certain mental space. And then
2791.74s: the shit happens. And they're like, oh, okay, I'm in a completely different mental space. Yeah, I love
2797.18s: that conversation. Obviously, we're pretty much at time. So I, I literally have a million questions
2804.38s: for you. We can keep going. If I'm on that, on that note about psychology because I kind of want to
2810.94s: have an action plan here. But the way I structure my trading these days is I'm typically doing
2818.30s: one of three things if I'm trading off things at all. So a big, a big idea that I made a video about
2824.30s: not long ago was that people see that I have this options trading channel and I only talk about
2830.22s: options on the channel. And so I think that people might have the impression that I only trade
2835.98s: options. And that's like all I do in terms of my investing portfolio. But actually, it's a very
2843.10s: small percentage. And I think that's important because since you get a lot of leverage with options,
2849.18s: you don't need to allocate 100% of whatever you have saved up and in your investment accounts,
2855.10s: you don't have to allocate 100% of that money to options. And the fact I think is very dangerous.
2861.58s: So for example, like you could use 5% of your portfolio. Let's say you have,
2867.18s: let's say you have $50,000. I know that's a lot of money, but I have to kind of size it up here
2872.38s: because unless you have tens of thousands of dollars, like you can't really size position with
2877.66s: 5%. If you have $3,000, $5% of that is $150. There's not many options in positions you can put on
2886.78s: for $150. And so let's say you have $50,000, $5% of that is $25,000. Let's say you're really,
2895.42s: really bullish on some stock and you want to put on a position that is going to benefit immensely
2901.98s: from any increase that you see over the next couple of years. Well, you could take that $2,500 and
2907.66s: you could buy a call option with it in the year out, two years out expiration cycle. And you could
2913.82s: double or triple or 10X that money depending on the exact stock price increase that you see.
2920.14s: But you can only lose 1X. And so you either are going to lose 5%, which over a one year, two year
2927.50s: period, that's not going to kill you. You're not going to be at zero. But if your prediction is
2933.34s: correct and you should really only be doing this if you have a strong conviction about something
2937.42s: and you want that exposure. But you could double or triple 4X, whatever it is. And with that small
2944.30s: 5% allocation, that could result in an overall account gain that is still huge relative to the risk
2951.02s: you took. Right. And so I think with the leverage that you can get with options, you don't have to
2956.06s: take 100% of what you have. Unless of course you have just a couple thousand dollars. In which case,
2961.82s: it's hard to kind of diversify that into different position. And stocks are expensive, which is,
2967.42s: I think another reason people are drawn to options is that buying stocks is really expensive. Like,
2973.02s: if you want to buy a share of Amazon, you got to have $3,000. Whereas you could trade a call spread
2978.46s: on Amazon with a few hundred dollars and you could make a few hundred dollars from that position if
2983.66s: you're right. But I think it's I think it's dangerous to forego traditional investing and focus solely
2992.14s: on more active approaches. Just because you think about it over if I'm going to take all of my money,
2997.66s: everything I've saved up and I'm going to allocate it to strictly options trading. And I'm going to do
3003.42s: that for the next 10 years. Well, what that means is over the next 10 years, I have to be consistently
3010.70s: right about my short term predictions with what's going to happen in the stock market. Otherwise,
3016.38s: I'm going to lose money. And for me personally, getting back to the trader's psychology,
3021.74s: I don't want to I don't want to put myself into position where I have such a high bar to be successful.
3028.06s: I'm not saying that that's going to lead me to not do it at all. I love trading options. Like,
3033.58s: I'm going to be here for the rest of my life. But I just I don't need to spend or I don't need to
3038.94s: allocate 100% of whatever I'm saving to options because I know that they are more speculative because
3046.38s: they require whether you're trading directionally or neutral, it doesn't matter. You're still making
3051.42s: a prediction. And the success of your strategies depends specifically on the path that the stock
3058.38s: pays take over that trade duration. And so I don't want to put myself in a position where I'm not
3063.26s: going to make any money unless I'm successfully predicting short term movements and stocks over
3069.34s: the next 10 years. Like that. When I just think about that, like, that seems like a very stressful
3074.06s: situation to be in. And so I'd rather hold passive investments and actively purchase more long term
3080.70s: positions that actually represent something over a long period of time. Because I know with the
3086.54s: longer holding period, this has statistically been shown to be true too. The longer you hold stocks,
3093.34s: the higher the percentage chance that you have in making money. And in this book that I'm reading
3098.54s: psychology of money, I think he said over 20 year periods, there's been 100% chance of making money
3104.94s: thus far. But basically like on a one day period, it's 50%. Right. One year, it's 60. I think he said
3113.74s: 68% 10 years is even higher than 20 years is 100%. So like if I'm putting my money in those types of
3120.86s: positions, there's a lot less stress associated with that because I know it's not on me. I don't have
3126.54s: to predict where Tesla is going to go over the next 45 days. If I think in 10 years from now,
3131.98s: the company is going to be better off than it is now. And it's going to change the world and how we
3137.50s: see it. Then that's a much easier play to make with the majority of my money. But it doesn't mean that
3142.62s: I'm not going to buy some Tesla stock, Tesla stock, and then also take a portion of that and do some
3148.54s: highly leveraged, highly speculative option positions on. So I think like that gets back to
3155.74s: psychology. And for me, personally, like I don't want to put myself in a situation where I have
3161.26s: such a high bar required just to be successful, which is, which is I think one of the things that
3167.98s: happens with people when they get into options is that you see the benefits of it. Like you can
3173.10s: make a lot of money with a little bit of money and you can make money when the stock price doesn't
3177.26s: move at all. You can make money when the stock price moves in either direction and all these things,
3182.22s: they seem better than just passively investing. But I honestly, I think it's a really bad idea to
3189.98s: kind of forget about traditional investing, even though there are benefits to be had with options.
3195.66s: So I think I would agree with you. And I think for most folks finding some sort of mix is definitely
3202.54s: the right balance. For me personally, my margin account is all options. I trade all options and
3209.98s: I've done that for over a decade. And what I found is exactly like you're saying, for most people,
3218.86s: it doesn't work well. And I think one of the reasons why it has worked very well for me is because
3226.30s: the guy again, I talked about my time, I talk about him all the time because 80% of what I do is a
3233.26s: relic of this dude that's been trading for 60 years. So my mentor, he's retired. And he uses his
3241.10s: portfolio for income. So while a lot of people are trading spreads like you're talking about, I avoid
3247.02s: spreads at all costs. And most of his trading is covered strangles. So not even like naked strangles,
3255.74s: obviously, you know. But the way that he trades is really identifying with your concept of the
3263.90s: longer term game plan. So he trades primarily index ETFs. I trade primarily index ETFs. As a,
3272.22s: again, just a relic of the way he imprinted on me. And one of the things that he does, and this is
3278.46s: exactly what I did in March, is we allocate a certain amount of our account to this trade. Then we
3286.62s: figure out how much we want to enter. So if I allocate $300,000 to this trade, I'm not going to
3292.70s: enter with all 300K at once. I'm going to start with maybe 100K, 150K on the initial outlay.
3300.06s: And then it happened in March. As soon as the market started crashing, I continue to scale into
3307.02s: the trade until I hit my cap. And then I just took assignment. And then I exercised that long
3313.10s: term point of view, whereas I trade IWM a lot. So whereas I thought, eventually, the market will recover.
3319.98s: And the market will be fine. So I just sat on a shit ton of stock until the market started to move up.
3325.34s: And then I completely unwind. So it's very interesting listening to you talk about your journey through
3333.58s: active management, because I think most people touch the keyboard and the mouse too fucking much
3340.46s: and they get in their own damn way for somebody to take assignment. And then do nothing is so difficult.
3346.62s: And they like folks don't realize that. But they want to try to manipulate the trade and do all these
3350.78s: other things. Something I'm curious about, and I'd love to just dig into like your journey. Because you
3357.50s: do a lot of self analysis. It's very clear. How did you go about like truly getting yourself
3364.54s: to slow down in terms of your interactions, you know, with your trades as much, and becoming more
3370.14s: comfortable allowing your trade and your initial, you know, assumption to play out?
3376.94s: I think that comes with experience and just understanding, understanding that every impulse you
3383.18s: have doesn't need to be acted on. And I think that's a that's been a big lesson for me. So
3388.22s: how did you come to that? And also, I think I kind of got too smart for my own good where I almost
3394.62s: would talk myself out of almost every single trade. Because the initial assumption would be like,
3400.38s: oh, XYZ or Apple stock is down today. Therefore, I should sell this put spread because I can make,
3407.34s: you know, $300 of easy money. But if it plummets another 20% that I'm going to lose
3413.42s: whatever 1000, whatever the number is. And so you could look at it like, oh, it's a really high
3419.82s: probability trade. You have a really high probability of making money. Apple's a crowd favorite.
3424.86s: Like it's probably going to catch a bit at some point. Sure. So you should take, you should sell
3429.74s: that spread right now because you can. And I think I've talked myself out of a lot of
3436.38s: impulsive trades like that. Because you understand what can go wrong and you understand that there's
3443.82s: that specific time frame associated with it as well. So then how do you balance to the other side,
3450.46s: right? You like you're saying you talked yourself out of a lot of trades. How do you get yourself
3455.42s: then, you know, to find the good trades to make? It's a it's a hard question because as I said earlier,
3463.34s: in March, I kind of got sucked back in and I was doing bad things and I was being too active.
3471.26s: But a lot of that a lot of the activity was kind of trading around stock positions.
3478.14s: But I also did I was making a lot of speculative plays as well.
3481.74s: Primarily, the number one thing I was doing is I was betting on a market decrease in
3487.66s: after the initial balance in March and April. And that never happened. So I actually put I put too
3494.78s: much money into the into the high high reward low risk plays. I did a lot of asymmetric bets. I
3502.86s: was basically buying puts in five. I had puts an IWM got a call and Vxx not necessarily all at once,
3510.86s: but these are kind of conditions that I was trading. And the market just kept going up and I kept
3515.74s: leading those positions out. But I did make I did make a lot of money on the initial decline from
3522.14s: Vxx call options, because I had a lot of stocks in this main portfolio that I'm talking about.
3528.78s: And those were taken ahead. And I as we started to kind of inch into that decline. And as I started
3534.94s: to read more into the coronavirus headlines and kind of understand that this could be something
3542.22s: not so great. I started to actually put on long Vxx call positions. And those did really well.
3550.22s: So they sheltered a lot of losses from the stock going into the decline. But then as we rebounded
3555.98s: back, I started to bet heavily again on another leg lower in the market. Those those never happened.
3562.86s: So I I've earned a lot of money doing that. And also just like micro managing around those
3569.82s: positions, you know, like if I bought Vxx calls on one day and then the market went up, then I would
3578.06s: buy more because Vxx would be lower. And therefore I was kind of scaling into that position. And
3583.34s: that's how I was justifying it. But then maybe as we got a decline, I would kind of sell out to
3588.54s: earlier. So I just got I got way too active with that. But to answer your question like how how do you
3594.30s: select the trades these days? It's it's a difficult question. But I would say I didn't answer this
3602.14s: earlier. I said I was basically I'm doing one of three things from trading. The first is putting
3608.38s: on leveraged upside plays, which is primarily long term call options in specific companies or
3615.74s: it could be in index. Okay. Like SPY I had I had a couple of those positions where I purchased
3622.30s: like the 350 calls in SPY for $3 and they had like two years, two and a half years of expiration.
3629.98s: And I tripled up on those and I've since closed them. Yeah. It was like the bullish type of plays
3635.58s: that I'm doing. And Tesla, I have some pretty deep out of the money call spreads that I actually
3641.26s: legged into. So I purchased I purchased some calls in Tesla that had two years of expiration.
3648.22s: Yeah. Stock shot up on that same day that I entered and I was actually able to short the same
3654.94s: amount of calls at a hundred points higher. Right. And I collected the same amount of premium. So I
3659.34s: essentially legged into a call spread in my enterprise is zero. And since the strike with is a hundred
3667.82s: the max profit on those is $10,000. Right. So but the answer that there's no risk anymore. So
3675.02s: if I'm really bullish on a stock long term, then I'll look to these leveraged upside plays.
3682.14s: Yeah. But other than that, I'm either selling a directionally neutral index butterfly. So I do
3689.74s: I need a butterfly strategy and SPY or SPX depends on how I'm sizing it. But that's a directionally
3697.58s: neutral plane that basically doesn't have a lot of upside risk. The main risk is a severe decline
3704.62s: that's like a completely systematic strategy. So that really doesn't I don't lose sleep over that.
3709.66s: Right. And the third way I'm trading is if I have an existing stock position, such as one in Tesla,
3716.30s: this is the exact example of when I use this, if I have a stock position that's increased
3723.02s: like certainly in a short period of time. And therefore the profitability of that position is really
3728.94s: high. Then I'll actually look to hedge that position by using a put or put spread. So I did that in
3735.74s: Tesla because the cost basis in the main portfolio that is the stock and option mix. The cost
3743.66s: basis of Tesla shares is like $210. And the stock price obviously is a certainly high. It's shot
3751.82s: way higher just a couple months. And so going into the election and with all the uncertainty that's
3757.82s: still brewing with coronavirus and everything, I purchased some of the 300 puts, the purchase two
3763.74s: of the 300 puts in Tesla got it. And I bought those for $15. So those expired in I think November.
3771.42s: And so with that playing, the logic was Tesla shares have already seen this meteoric rise. I have
3778.14s: a lot of profits on the stock position. But I can use this opportunity to buy these put options
3784.06s: that are really cheap now at that strike price because the stock price is gone. So right. And since my
3790.14s: cost basis is $210 on the shares and I bought the 300 puts for $15. Effectively, like the minimum
3798.06s: sale price for those Tesla shares through November expiration is $285. So the strike price of $300
3804.70s: minus the cost of the puts is $285. Right. The entry price in the shares is $211. So if Tesla
3811.02s: shares go to zero, I'm guaranteed to be able to sell the share that at $285, essentially.
3817.90s: Right. It would be effective sale price inside. I bought the 300 puts for $15.
3822.94s: Well, like, Tesla goes to zero. I don't think anybody's doing shit. We're probably not going to be on
3828.78s: the computer very much. Yeah. Yeah. Who knows? You never know. But selecting, I think selecting trades
3836.94s: is really hard. And it's trader specific because everybody has kind of the signals that they look
3843.02s: for their own personal predictions. These days, I'm not trying to make an aggressive amount of
3848.54s: predictions, but I do need options when I have a stronger conviction on a particular company. Or
3854.86s: I just want leverage exposure. Like, let's say I have $125,000 into the account. And I'm already
3863.18s: invested with $100,000 of it. Right. 25,000 left over. So maybe instead of buying shares of the
3870.54s: company that I'm bullish on long term, instead of spending that larger outlay, maybe I'll spend
3876.38s: the same amount or a fraction of that and just turn it into an option play. And therefore, I can get
3882.46s: exposure to that long term move. And I don't have to necessarily break the bank and doing it. So
3888.54s: I don't necessarily have allocate the remaining amount attached to that one position. By using an
3893.50s: option, I can get the leverage, but I still have limited downside if I'm wrong. So yeah, I love how I
3898.78s: think about it. But how does the trade is such a difficult topic because everybody has their own
3904.54s: strategies. Everybody has their own stocks that they trade and their own philosophies. I think
3910.14s: that's a really difficult question to answer. But I try to be, I try not to make as many predictions
3918.78s: in the short term as I can. So I try to, I'm going to make a leverage option play. Typically,
3924.06s: it's going to have an expiration a couple of years out. And I think that's, I actually love that
3928.78s: strategy as well. I mean, too. Me too. Me too. Maybe not right. This is second, but I know I'm going
3933.58s: to employ that strategy a lot in the future. Yeah. My, so something that I've always appreciated
3940.30s: my mentor for is whenever I would feel like I have an opinion on where an underlying was going,
3946.86s: he would essentially always just call me a fucking idiot. And he would always say like, I'm worried
3951.18s: about the wrong thing. He's like, stop worrying about where things are going to go. He's like,
3954.30s: start worrying about money management. He's like, right at the end of the day. And he's really
3959.18s: imprinted that on me where like, for most of my trades right now, and I truly mean it, like,
3964.22s: I couldn't care less where the underlying goes because I know what I'm going to do if it plummets.
3969.02s: I know what it's going to, what I'm going to do if it goes up. And most of my strategies are
3974.30s: coverage strangle. So a big part of it is just get ready to sit and wait. And as long as you're
3979.90s: comfortable with that, and it takes, it took me a long time to get there. And once your account
3983.98s: continues to grow, it becomes easier and easier since you have additional capital to do other
3988.54s: things with as you see fit. But I love that you're talking about the longer term long options.
3996.46s: I very rarely buy premium, but I do. And I kind of scold people that, you know, are dead set
4004.54s: on only buying or selling. I always feel like it's a pretty ignorant position. There's a time for both.
4009.98s: And the way that if I'm buying options, it's typically a leap. And I'll generally employ like some
4018.38s: sort of ratio diagonal. So I'll still sell calls against the longs. But in contrast to your approach,
4024.94s: where you'll go out of the money, obviously paying less, I typically goes, I go very far in the money.
4031.50s: So I can try to limit, um, faded to K on the position and make sure, you know, I'm capturing some
4037.18s: intrinsic value, but trade off is more expensive. But it's, it's really cool to hear you talk about,
4046.38s: leaps, because most people who are buying options, they're cheap. You know what I mean? They want to
4050.62s: buy it in the next two weeks, because it's a low dollar amount. But I've done it too. I'm guilty as well.
4055.34s: I'm just just, um, yeah. So I guess what you said kind of builds on what I was saying by talking
4064.78s: myself on a trade. It's that like, if I'm going to put on this 30 day off and play that requires
4069.74s: a specific movement to happen, it could happen over the next three months or the next year. But for
4075.58s: me to put money on the line and say with high certainty that's going to happen in the next three days.
4081.66s: Right. Those types of trades are, they're much more like gambling. They're much more speculative,
4087.34s: because I, I use this term, the path of the stock price. And basically what I mean by that is
4093.10s: literally like the path of the stock price takes over a specific period of time.
4098.54s: Option option phrase and option position are entirely dependent on the path that the stock
4105.98s: price takes. So for example, if you're going to say Netflix is overvalued, it's whatever it is,
4113.10s: let's say it's $525 a share. I don't know where it is right now. And you think that Netflix for sure
4119.26s: is going to be below $600 in 30 days or 60 days. So for that reason, you might go out to the 60 day
4128.14s: expiration cycle and you might short the 600 call option just by itself, because you're, you're
4134.86s: very convinced that Netflix is going to be below $600 and 60 days. And with the stock at 525,
4141.34s: it's a very high probability play because it has to go up more than $75 by expiration for you to
4148.94s: lose money on that. But what a lot of people overlook is even though that is a high probability
4155.42s: strategy, you have to keep in mind what the stock path would mean for your strategy. So if the path
4162.62s: of the stock was just flat, it traded at 525 through the 60 day period, then you're just going to see
4168.62s: steady decay on your 600 short call and you're going to make easy money. But let's say you short
4174.30s: that same call in the other path that happens where a different path is the stock goes from 525
4180.70s: and it gaps to 600 the next day. Well, now your assumption on the prior day was, yeah, there's
4187.82s: a good chance Netflix is below 600 in the next 60 days, which is a high probability event at that
4193.66s: moment. And you could collect a few hundred dollars on that option and you think it's free money.
4199.90s: But then if the stock price gaps higher in the very short term after you enter that trade,
4205.34s: now you have this massive unrealized loss on the short call. And now you're thinking, well,
4211.34s: if it goes to 700, then I'm going to be out a huge amount of money. And so maybe you close that
4218.06s: short call because you think that it's not worth the risk anymore. You've already lost a lot. You
4224.62s: can't stomach losing anymore. And then right after you get out of that call, the stock price maybe
4230.14s: goes a little higher. It gets to 610. But then it goes back to 575, 550 goes up to 575. And at the
4237.50s: expiration date of your call, it's below 600. Like you thought initially, but since the stock path was
4243.74s: not accommodative at all in the initial period. And since you took such a huge heat, initially,
4250.22s: you got shaken out. So I think it's to look at an option position or a particular trade.
4257.26s: Instead of just looking at like, here's the max loss, here's the max profit, like here's the
4261.98s: probability of profit. That's all that expiration. You have to think about what can happen before
4267.82s: expiration, which is the stock price path. And what will be your reaction to those movements? And I
4273.50s: think thinking about the particular path that the stock price can take, I think it can help you
4279.18s: understand the risk and kind of looking go wrong. As opposed to just saying Netflix is at 525,
4284.70s: there's really had probabilities that it's going to be below 660 days. So I'm going to sell the
4289.66s: short 600 to be easy money. You could be right about your assumption. But what happens in between
4296.78s: entry and expiration? And how do you react? That can that can be a wild ride and it can be so.
4302.94s: I honestly are prepared for. I absolutely love that example. I really do because I also think a lot
4309.98s: of people when they're setting up a higher probability trade, let's just say that was 20 delta,
4315.02s: whatever it is. And if you think about a lot of people forget the probability of a touch,
4320.54s: which is exactly that. There's a pretty good likelihood at some point your option is going
4325.34s: to be underwater. And exactly like you said, even though your entire long term assumption does in
4330.78s: fact play out that shorter term touch assumption or just calculation also tends to play out.
4338.30s: And if you find yourself in that scenario where you're not ready to see your position underwater
4342.78s: and then what that actually looked, I love that. I really do because a lot of people, it seems like
4347.10s: they're just so focused on the probability when they enter. And then what that looks like at
4351.10s: expiration and the money they're going to make. They forego the interim, I think that's a really
4356.78s: good conversation. The other thing that my mentor talks a lot about is expectancy because
4362.38s: everybody wants to talk about probability profit. Everybody wants to talk about the likelihood
4366.78s: of different things happening. But that's like that's half of the equation that matters to you.
4371.74s: It's not that it doesn't mean anything. Exactly. And like everybody wants to obsess over these
4377.18s: different metrics. And like he always says, he doesn't get it. And I'm always, I question him a lot
4383.26s: on it. And he's like, at the end of the day, you know, the likelihood of something matters 50%.
4387.74s: The other is what is your average PNL attached to those likelihoods? Because like you're saying
4393.90s: right there, if you're getting shaken out on a really low paying but high probability trade,
4400.22s: typically really poor expectancy. Because as soon as you get that move against you, it's going to wipe
4404.86s: out eight, 10 trades. And then you know, you're kind of sitting there holding that. I find that
4409.90s: to be a really uncommon conversation with people because they don't like to think through that
4415.10s: in terms. It's, I like that. I like that you bring that up. Another example would be,
4424.78s: I think, I think talking about stock price paths is a very interesting thing. And this is something
4431.50s: that you kind of, you'll read about if you read about like more advanced option pricing,
4438.22s: documents, stuff like that, or you get into the more academic side of things I should say. And
4443.26s: you feel like really deep on how these things work. But the path is like, that's everything
4449.42s: in optistry. What could happen before expiration? And that's kind of where option prices get their
4457.18s: their prices from. One of the, I think it's called the binomial tree is one of the pricing. So
4462.94s: basically, it's like, here are all the potential paths of the stock through between now and
4468.30s: expiration. And if those paths or each path is successful, here is what the option price will be.
4475.34s: And basically, it takes all of the different potential paths. And then basically takes like a
4480.22s: weighted average of option price values. And that's the option price. Sheldon talks. So I think
4485.26s: that's like a very, that's a very crude way of explaining it. And if there's anybody who is
4491.10s: effective, much more specific, like with that knowledge and they understand exactly how that works,
4496.30s: then maybe there are some holes in what I just said, but that's like, there's like one,
4501.26s: there's one that's one way to price and option is like, yeah, I feel like all the potential paths
4506.30s: based on the probability. And then you take the probability weighted value of that option at each
4512.22s: one of those paths. And then that's the option price. Yeah. But as I was going to say earlier,
4516.94s: another example would be if you're extremely bullish on a stock and you think it's going to go up,
4523.66s: a lot of people are gravitating towards a short term option, maybe seven days out and they'll
4528.14s: buy the item when you call. And let's say you put, you know, 10% of your account into that trait,
4534.70s: which is obviously a large percentage for much recreation. And over the next seven days,
4541.82s: like the stock phrase kind of transpired, maybe gets closer to your straight, but it expired out
4547.34s: of the money. And therefore, you just lost 10%. And then the next week, now the stock phrase to
4553.50s: shot higher and your initial outlook was completely accurate, except you just had the timing wrong.
4560.22s: And another way to say is that the stock price path over the duration of your trade was not
4565.98s: specific enough. And you didn't get that part of it right. And therefore, you were right overall,
4571.34s: but you were wrong with your trade. And obviously, you'd have to kind of match up your time frame
4577.58s: with your outlook. But that's again, you can still miss out, regardless of what time frame you choose.
4583.34s: And so that's kind of how I think when I think about the more speculative plays, because I'll admit,
4589.58s: like, if I'm not trading a specific trading plan with the rules all laid out, which is basically
4595.02s: the S&P 500 butterfly strategy. That's a short-term strategy, because the entry is 60 days out.
4601.98s: I know exactly how I'm going to size it relative to the account. I know exactly what is going to
4607.02s: trigger the trade to be closed. And then I know exactly when I'm going to re-enter the trade.
4611.02s: So that's not, it is speculative still, because it still requires the market to accommodate the
4617.02s: strategy. But every single trade is managed exactly the same, right? The sizing for each trade
4622.78s: is exactly the same. And so it's a very easy strategy to follow over a one year, two year,
4628.54s: three year period. And if you are going to allocate like a specific amount of your account to
4635.90s: an active strategy like that, I think it has to be rules based just so you can number one keep
4640.30s: your sanity. But also, if you have consistency with how you manage the position, and especially if
4646.06s: you've done back testing and you've seen some encouraging results from that, even though it's not
4650.86s: same, that's better than just choosing 10 different stocks every month, choose your prediction,
4657.42s: and then structure all these different types of strategies around your predictions. And they're all
4661.90s: differently sized. You're managing them all different. Then at the end of the day, whether you're
4666.30s: successful or not, you don't know if it was luck or if it was just from discipline. So
4672.78s: that's kind of like the really long answer. This is still on the how do you choose trade thing, I think.
4678.54s: But yeah, so like if it's outside of a predetermined system with rules, then I'm just fully understanding
4686.22s: of the fact that I'm speculating. You just have to accept that. I talk a lot about like trading
4692.46s: plan and strategy outlines for that exact reason, because I always tell people unless you learn to
4697.74s: like identify, monitor, and control variables, one, you can't replicate, and two, you can't make
4702.94s: adjustments in any sort of calculated manner to see how things go. So the way that I have my personal
4709.02s: portfolio broken out is I call them core holdings, which is probably exactly what you would assume it
4713.26s: to be. And then I have a speculative portion. And in the speculative portion, there's a certain set of
4718.38s: strategies that I'll apply, and I have strategy outlines for all of them for that exact reason,
4722.94s: exactly what you're talking about. Because the shotgun blast leads to whatever results it's going to
4728.30s: lead to, and then who knows what it will be next time. Yeah, I think that's a great way to learn
4733.42s: is to experiment a lot and do a lot of that and be very active. But I think if you really want to use
4739.66s: options systematically, and you want to like a lot of people want to trade options for a living,
4745.10s: for income, that's the case. You're not going to do that by just doing all random strategies and
4752.86s: coming up with your own specific predictions each week or each month. It's not going to happen
4758.30s: because that requires you to be consistently predicting short-term stock price movement,
4764.94s: which nobody can do that consistently. And the shorter time you go, the more uncertain it is
4770.30s: with whatever your prediction is. So if I say the market's going to go up tomorrow versus the
4777.34s: market's going to go up over the next 10 years, there's a big difference between those two statements.
4782.46s: The shorter the term, the more it is like gambling, I feel. And if you are really,
4789.50s: really active without a plan, I also think that is gambling. Because unless you have a very strict
4796.30s: plan for each strategy that you're trading and you're sizing them all the same, then you can
4801.10s: actually figure out, all right, this strategy, I manage them all the same, my size them all the same,
4806.70s: my results were X. Then you can actually reverse into new that and study the performance.
4813.42s: Much more so than if you have 20 different trading strategy and you're using, you have 20 different
4819.26s: stocks and you're managing them all different ways and your size and the mother the way. It's going
4824.14s: to be much harder to attribute success or fail to one single point.
4828.54s: Yeah, that's one of the things that I think is people mature as traders, they start to identify
4834.70s: the sustainability of what they're doing. When I was in college, I used to really enjoy trading
4839.42s: forex and I was pretty good at it. And then as I started my career in the Marine Corps, I stopped
4845.90s: trading forex and it was weird to walk away from something I was doing well at. But then when I
4850.78s: did the post mortem on it, I realized the amount of time it was taking me to adequately research what
4856.54s: I felt comfortable doing before I was placing trades. I was like, this isn't sustainable man.
4860.78s: There's no way I want or probably can continue this. And that's again, when I kind of came across
4868.22s: momentum, I had a conversation with them, and they was just like, stop worrying about direction,
4871.90s: start figuring out how to place trades and work around them based on money management, like I said
4877.98s: before. And it's exactly like you're saying, like if you're trying to consistently, yes, short-term
4884.78s: returns, you're just leaving it up to chance, pure chance. And that's something that he talks a lot
4890.70s: about. And I share on his behalf where when I was like in the phase where I was aggressively growing
4899.02s: my account, I tell people I target at least 15% return career. Sometimes that will underperform
4906.62s: the S&P 500. A lot of other times it will outperform the S&P 500, kind of just depend on where things lie.
4912.62s: And what he always taught me is once you're starting to get closer to retirement to draw on this
4919.10s: account, he's like, you're out of your mind if you're going to continue using that 15% as your
4923.98s: planning variable, like especially when you depend on your income. So he's like, when you're doing
4927.58s: your planning factor, make sure you have enough money that you can crank that all the way down to
4932.94s: five, six percent somewhere in there and still get the amount of money you want per month in order
4938.30s: to live off of it. And that was just an eye-opening concept because 15% per year is really good.
4944.30s: It's nothing astronomical, like you said, there's a duty of 30 for like 15 years. But it's modest
4950.86s: and it's something that's attainable. And it was weird to me to hear him kind of even scold that
4955.90s: once you're trying to reliably draw on it. So I think it reinforces the point you're making that
4960.86s: you're trying to trade in a way that you have to be correct and you need to perform well in order
4967.66s: to get what you need to get can be one very stressful and then two, set you up for failure in a
4972.86s: pretty big way. Right. You got to have you got to have a plan. If you look at
4977.50s: if you look at any professional trader, meaning they trade at a trading firm, they have a trading plan
4985.82s: like 99%. There's probably very few traders that you'll talk to that don't have any resemblance
4992.54s: of a plan. And they're just successful a year after year just from just from their predictions that
4999.58s: are coming out of their head. Yeah. There has to be some sort of plan as the backbone. If you are
5004.30s: going to trade very actively and especially if you're going to put like a serious amount of capital
5011.34s: into those strategies. Yeah. Yeah. Something that obviously I know that we're well over now and
5018.70s: like I said, I really do respect your time. So thank you. Something I'm really curious about on
5023.66s: that same vein though in your thought process. I get the sensation that some people when they
5030.30s: start trading and they're applying their time, they feel like they deserve a certain return because
5037.90s: they're applying that time. I'm sitting in front of the computer all of this time. I should get
5043.18s: extra turn at the end of the year. And like we've both been talking about, again, like I read a lot
5049.74s: of white papers from MIT University of California and everything unanimously in terms of those studies
5055.82s: says the more you touch the computer, the lower the average return is for those folks.
5062.46s: So I'm curious what your thoughts are in having those conversations with those people because
5068.22s: that's something I find myself doing a lot like trying to have a conversation to save people from
5072.70s: themselves and essentially letting them know that you don't deserve shit. And at the end of the day,
5081.58s: like the more you touch the computer, the worse off you are, but a lot of people refute that.
5086.14s: Have you had a conversation like that with anybody? I'm curious how you'd approach that dialogue.
5091.58s: I've had people through email correspondence that will say that they've been emailing me for a while.
5097.98s: They've been learning for probably over a year in some cases.
5103.82s: And they kind of get discouraged because they feel like, although say things like,
5108.54s: you know, there's so much to this option stuff, like it's really, really a lot. And it's true.
5113.58s: And I'm not sure if you're probably familiar with the Dunning Kruger effect, which is essentially,
5120.54s: as soon as you get involved in something new, you feel like you're a genius and you know everything.
5126.22s: And then that's like the peak of the introduction phase of learning something new.
5131.10s: And then before you learn, then it goes back into like negative territory, which is like, wow, I don't know shit.
5136.78s: I don't know shit. Yeah.
5137.82s: And then as you continue to get more experience, you get closer to that initial baseline where
5145.26s: you realize that you know a lot, but you still are, you're still acknowledging the fact that
5151.26s: there's more to know. Yes. So I think option straining is a perfect example of that because
5156.62s: as soon as you come out of the gates and you have like your first few months of learning,
5159.98s: you feel like you're on top of the world and you know everything and you're going to be rich.
5165.50s: And then months later or a couple of years later, you're continuing to learn. And then you realize,
5172.06s: wow, like everything in the past that I thought was a holy grail strategy. It turns out that
5178.94s: this is very, very difficult. There's a lot to know before you can even get to a playing field where
5184.46s: you're not making, you're not losing money from mistakes or not knowing something. You're losing
5188.30s: money because you're wrong. Yes. And options is one of the most humbling things because you can know
5194.94s: everything there is about option straining and still that does not guarantee that you're going to make
5199.50s: it. Still be wrong. And that's a very difficult thing to swallow for most people. Yeah.
5204.86s: But it's true. Like there's just because you know everything about options and how they work,
5210.46s: the next step is to actually implement them in scenarios where they profit. And there's no
5215.82s: guarantee that you can do that consistently over time. And so that's another reason why I focus
5224.14s: most of my savings into passively investing because I know that over a long period of time,
5230.70s: compound interest can grow whatever I put in now hundreds of times, thousands of times in
5237.58s: some cases depending on whatever you put it into. But I don't want to risk having to be right
5245.50s: about every prediction that I make knowing that I'm going to be wrong on a lot of predictions.
5250.46s: And I don't want to structure my financial future around having to be right consistently
5257.18s: in the short term over a long period of time. It's just too stressful for me. So
5261.66s: yeah, like options is the more you know the better because you can avoid
5266.62s: you can avoid catastrophic losses through mistakes or just not knowing something.
5272.38s: But there is a certain amount of time you have to put in before you get to a point where
5279.18s: you're pretty comfortable that you know like pretty much all there is that you need to know.
5284.54s: There's obviously always going to be more to learn. Yeah. And like I consider myself to be an expert,
5290.14s: but I know that I don't know everything. There's always more to learn. But once you get to that point
5294.94s: where like you know everything or as much as you need to know to actually implement these things
5301.98s: whenever you see fit and you know what's going to happen given certain scenarios with this position,
5307.42s: it still doesn't guarantee that you're going to make money. And that's a difficult thing to
5312.62s: digest, but it's true. Yeah, it's I like to talk a lot about it in terms of you know like the
5319.10s: practical understanding versus the scholastic understanding. So a lot of people can go really far
5324.70s: in their scholastic understanding of options or whatever they're doing. But unless you learn how to
5330.54s: like practically apply it, it's you know just a scholastic understanding. And you know because things
5336.54s: scholastically should work out x, y and z way, it doesn't mean in a practical sense that it's
5343.02s: going to. So I think that it's honestly really impressive on your end that you kind of acknowledged
5351.90s: and looked through the way that you trade and said yes, you know I'm an option trader, but financially
5358.94s: it literally makes sense for me to have this kind of two prong approach with passive investments
5363.98s: and option. But I seriously respect that so much because a lot of people that start options
5369.74s: trading, I mean like I said, I trade pretty much only options. And there's just so many of us
5376.46s: that I talk to they again think that well if I just continue to trade, I'll pick it up and I'll
5381.74s: start making money. And you know for a lot of people they just are throwing away their future wealth
5388.06s: chasing something that they're just not performing on. So I think that's really awesome.
5394.70s: And I think the situation you want to avoid and this is another reason why I buy,
5401.50s: you know I'm buying stocks and buying Bitcoin as I'm a Bitcoiner. But I'm buying these things
5408.62s: and investing long term because I don't want to be in a situation where if I was only trading
5415.02s: options and in a year the stock market goes up 20% and I happen to lose money trading options,
5421.18s: then that's a bad situation to be in because it's horrible because you don't want to see the market go
5425.90s: up 20% when everyone else made 20% and you lost money because you didn't have any slice of that.
5431.82s: And so that's that's kind of another reason why I'm structuring that way and I just think it's
5438.30s: I think it's irrational for me to think that I am so smart where my predictions are always
5444.46s: going to be true. Yeah. That's why I with the majority of my free savings I am investing that
5452.06s: long term. But like talking about rational versus irrational, like I think the most rational thing
5459.26s: for me to do or most reasonable thing for me to do will be to take all of my savings and just put
5466.94s: it in a passive index fund and just put all of that money into the next fund and just let it sit
5472.94s: for whatever the rest of my life and let that grow. But just because I think that is the most
5479.74s: rational thing for me to do doesn't mean I'm going to not be irrational with a small portion of my money.
5484.62s: I enjoy making predictions. I enjoy trading options and I enjoy you know learn or implement
5493.42s: the things that I've learned over the past two years. So like just because just because there's like a
5501.34s: and obvious like rational approach doesn't mean I'm going to actually follow that.
5505.10s: And if that's just human nature that's not just with trading that's with everything. Like I think
5511.98s: everyone can agree the most rational thing for me to do would be to get up every day and I should
5517.42s: probably work out every day exercise every day because that's going to be good for me long term.
5522.62s: But even though people know that they don't do that and so there's a you have to understand
5528.54s: and like we're all human and we're going to do things that are irrational and it's fine.
5535.74s: It's a really fun conversation and kind of hearing that side of things because
5540.94s: I am the dude that wakes up every day and works out because I know I'm supposed to but I'll also
5545.66s: eat I have beats the last night which I know I'm not supposed to do. It's that same thing right?
5549.26s: Why would I go?
5549.98s: I'm like a thousand calories of Chinese food actually. Yeah.
5552.78s: I'm glad I ordered orange chicken hands general so it's chicken because I have leftovers
5558.14s: that I get right and then they got it's now I get to indulge two days in the row.
5561.90s: That's beautiful.
5562.86s: It's only because only supposed to be a cheap Sunday.
5566.22s: Yeah, but I mean I also I would argue that by continuing to trade options I mean who knows
5571.58s: man like you absolutely can continue developing your approach and just find the next thing that works
5577.26s: for you because something that my mentor always told me is like when you're retired you can't draw
5583.26s: monthly income via trading stocks. Not consistently so he's like you have to understand a way
5590.46s: to use your capital to be if you want to draw for income right.
5594.86s: But again like by continuing to trade options no matter what we're still developing a skill set
5600.94s: that in the future very likely can be very helpful to us.
5604.46s: Yeah that's a great that's a great point that's a positive point.
5607.66s: I feel like we've talked about a lot of maybe discouraging things today and I don't want to be
5612.22s: discouraging whatsoever but what you just said is perfect because as I just said to you that
5619.02s: I'm not trading options every single day I'm not like super super active with it but I do do it
5624.06s: but there is there's always value and having knowledge.
5629.82s: So there's this quote that my brother said he said fortune favors the prepared mind.
5634.54s: I think this this guy Lewis Lewis Pest Store said it initially and now I'm now that's how I close
5640.86s: out my newer YouTube videos. Perfect.
5643.18s: Portion favors the prepared mind. So even though it may not be in your best interest to be
5650.70s: trading options like 30 times a day or whatever it is or using them actively and just because
5656.46s: you know the kind of the odds are stacked against active traders like more active you are
5661.26s: the worse you'll do statistically speaking it doesn't mean that it's a bad thing to learn something
5668.22s: because for example let's say you give up on options you don't know how options work because
5674.46s: they're too complicated or you hear this conversation and are you're discouraged?
5677.50s: They're like yeah fuck that.
5680.38s: And then you just you don't you don't learn about options and then let's say
5685.42s: you have a million dollar stock portfolio that grows immensely over over a multi-decking period
5693.74s: and then there's something that happens in the world where you have this prediction maybe that
5699.90s: you want to protect against some very unfortunate outcome with your stock portfolio.
5705.42s: So one thing you could do you could purchase put options in the S&P 500 index and that would
5711.18s: effectively hedge your stock portfolio and if you understand the way that you could structure that
5718.46s: to protect yourself against catastrophic loss if you're correct about this prediction
5723.26s: but you only give up a small portion of your profits if you're wrong then if you understand options
5729.90s: you know how to do that exactly you can structure that trade but if you have no idea how options
5735.10s: work then there's no way you could ever use them in any situation that could benefit you
5740.54s: when you could be implementing them with some sort of prediction that you have.
5745.82s: And so I think there's a lot of value in knowledge I'm a huge bookworm myself I love learning
5751.82s: I love reading about different perspectives just because I think anything that can broaden your
5756.14s: perspective or see something from a different angle I think that is immensely valuable and so
5762.54s: to go along with that I think there's excuse me I think there's a ton of value in understanding
5769.26s: active trading having experience with active trading knowing how options work knowing how futures
5774.62s: work how the financial markets work in general I think understanding all those things it's never
5779.98s: going to be a bad thing to know those things because when the time comes if you are paired with
5785.74s: this knowledge then there could be times where you say I know exactly what I need to do and I need
5791.34s: to do it tomorrow because I already I don't need to learn I already know everything that I need to know
5796.54s: for this particular play and here's what I'm going to do and I'm going to put this trade on and
5801.90s: that's it you know if you don't have the knowledge you never spent the time learning about something
5806.38s: then you're not going to be able to identify that circumstance yeah you can't open that door for
5810.78s: yourself yeah I think I think understanding options is hugely valuable and you learn a ton about
5819.58s: financial markets and through the process of learning options you learn about yourself you learn
5824.38s: about you know the the trading kind of psychology like everything that goes along with trading yeah
5830.38s: I think a lot of value in all those things especially if you get to even if it's even if it's a
5837.42s: thing where you get to a point where you realize you know maybe I don't want to be an active trader
5841.58s: maybe I do want to be a passive investor but if you learn those things sooner than later it's going
5846.70s: to be better than learning them later and it's based on you know your experience so yeah it's easier
5851.90s: for you to deploy with conviction right like I'm so I'm so grateful that I have all the experience that
5858.70s: I have because if I was if I didn't have a lot of experience and investing or especially
5866.22s: active trading with options maybe I would just be getting into it today and maybe I have you know
5873.10s: a hundred thousand dollars saved up that I saved up over the last 10 years yep and now I'm just
5877.90s: starting to learn about options with no prior experience or knowledge but I have more money now
5883.58s: and I'm learning with a larger a larger stack of cash and now I make these mistakes let's say
5888.54s: I wait about 10 years of saving because I didn't understand how these things work and that's not
5893.90s: a situation you want to be in so I think learning learning is learning about these things is going
5900.22s: to always be valuable because at the very least you can avoid land mines and knowledge and experience
5906.14s: is always a good thing no matter what so yeah yeah and I mean I think just like you're saying
5912.38s: exploring different perspectives and you know life use and whatnot it's literally the entire
5916.54s: purpose of this entire segment is exactly that because I do find a tremendous of value in it and I know
5921.74s: when I first started trading options like most I was struggling and not doing very well and then
5928.30s: when I was able to like drill down mentor for like literally force me to write a trading plan
5933.90s: to paper trades like take this shit seriously then for me I've been just so fortunate with the way
5941.90s: that it is changed my trajectory and it's not from you know any sort of pure luck it's just
5948.06s: from like taking the fucking time to like truly sit down and understand these things and how I can
5954.46s: apply them and I think for a lot of people you know no matter in what capacity you choose to apply
5961.02s: you know something like options or whatever there's just a lot of utility and then whether you're
5964.78s: like me and you trade them exclusively or like you and you trade them as a component of a larger
5969.02s: portfolio biggest thing about trading and I think dovetailing off your psychology comment man it's
5974.70s: individual to the person man everybody works differently you have an incredible amount of self-awareness
5979.50s: so do I in the sense that like I know I don't know fucking shit so I just try to do what I know and
5986.38s: learn as much as I can and that's generally my approach and like your self-awareness has led you to
5991.98s: a place where you know you can get sleep now you're comfortable with what you're doing stuff like
5995.74s: that because there's so many people I mean you saw the kid that killed himself because of some
6000.94s: shit that wasn't even real right you know what I mean like just it's just insane so I totally agree
6006.94s: with you that you know just taking the time to get the education is super important and help
6010.86s: pull yeah minute as a as a final note on that I think having experience with active trading
6020.54s: and having experience with options but mostly just like having experience being super acting
6026.06s: in the markets can make you a much better passive investor as well because it can teach you
6033.26s: it can teach you about the impulses that you feel in certain situations and then it can teach you
6039.34s: that the best thing to do is probably nothing you know like with your option positions you could
6045.02s: you could be swayed to deviate from your trading plan because of some sort of term movement
6050.22s: and when in reality you know that you have to follow the trading plan and you can't you shouldn't
6055.90s: touch it right so yeah from the traditional investing long-term investing perspective if you
6061.58s: are buying stock let's say you buy this company that you love and then the next month stocks down
6066.62s: 30% if you have a lot of market experience and active trading experience then you'll know that
6072.30s: things don't always go according to plan right in fact more often than not they don't go according to
6078.30s: plan and if you're equipped with that mindset I think it can be very informing and it can help you
6086.06s: make better decisions overall so I definitely attribute whatever future success I have with
6094.78s: passive investing I think a large part of that success is going to be attributed to my experiences
6102.38s: with more active approaches so I think having the active approach or having the active experience
6107.34s: can make you a better long-term investor in more capacity it's powerful honestly I've never
6113.90s: I truly have never sat down to think of it that way and that's a really powerful comment and I
6119.82s: literally as I hear you talking about I couldn't agree with the sentiment more I think that that
6124.14s: makes a ton of sense you know so the other day experience from saw that's it fact never never a bad
6131.26s: thing to have knowledge or experience so yeah don't don't let this conversation discourage you
6136.78s: if you're an aspiring office trader we basically we we kind of just talked talk through
6143.26s: years and years of experience and kind of the psychological rollercoaster that you have over that
6148.78s: a whole experience too so hopefully people that are just getting started or maybe just a couple
6153.26s: of years in hopefully those people can can learn from the things that we're talking about today
6159.34s: yeah man and you know like I said I seriously can't thank you enough for your time it's
6163.90s: super dope talking with you about this stuff I'd love to do a follow-on session with you at some
6168.78s: point there's definitely a lot more than I want to explore with you but until next time you know
6175.50s: like I said thank you so much for your time looking forward to chat with you again yeah for sure
6180.86s: thanks for having me all right brother we'll catch you later sounds good have a good rest of your day
