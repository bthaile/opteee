0.00s: Everyone, Eric here with part three of the small stack segment.
5.00s: And this one I want to outline my strategies, kind of what I'm looking to employ here.
10.00s: So nothing new. It's going to be cash secured puts to covered calls to cash secured strangles, diagonals, and maybe some verticals.
20.00s: So let's walk through what I'm looking at.
23.00s: The cash secured put covered call covered strangle I bucket those all together because they're very fine.
29.00s: This is going to be essentially my staple strategy for the put side.
33.00s: I'm going to be looking at point two to point three deltas.
37.00s: And it's because I want to balance probability of being assigned. I want to avoid assignment, but I also don't want to roll that much.
44.00s: So to work around that, that's why I'm looking at point two point three deltas.
50.00s: I would like to add to this, make sure that I'm getting at least one percent return on invested capital.
58.00s: And once I am assigned for the covered calls, I'm going to make sure that the short strike is above my basis period.
65.00s: So if there's a point where I can't sell calls above my basis, I'm just going to hold.
71.00s: Unless it hits my downside management, which is going to be anything greater than a 10% drop would be a candidate to sell.
82.00s: I will take a look at it. If I still have strong convictions, then I will likely hold on to the product longer term.
89.00s: But once I hit 10% draw down, I'm going to take a look if I am long stock.
97.00s: Or either the puts or calls, I'm going to look at managing 55% max profit.
103.00s: Or once I get within that 20 days to expiration, probably closer to 17 18 days.
109.00s: So I want to try to squeeze a little bit more out of these.
112.00s: Now, the other thing for managing, unlike my regular account in this scenario, I'm going to make sure that I can find a suitable replacement that is going to provide me a larger dollar amount.
125.00s: Then what is left in the current trade. So for example, if I sell a little put for 50 cents.
132.00s: And there's, you know, 22 cents left on the table.
136.00s: If I can find a trade that's going to give me more than 22 cents and I like it, then I can manage this and enter another trade.
143.00s: But I need to have a replacement in mind. Otherwise, whether I hit that 55% or greater, I'm going to leave the trade on.
151.00s: The reason I have minimized rolling here is I, smaller accounts don't have a lot of capital.
156.00s: So if I continue to roll puts too much, you have to remember each time you roll put, you're going to book a loss.
163.00s: And on smaller accounts, that loss can add up.
166.00s: And a lot of folks get confused where money goes. But in short, you have your net liquidating value, which is your account.
175.00s: And then you have your cash and sweep. And when you roll your net liquidating value goes down because you're booking a loss.
183.00s: Although your cash and sweep will go up as long as you're pulling in a credit.
188.00s: So sooner or later you can find yourself in a scenario where your net liquidating value is zero, even though your cash and sweep can have a bunch of money in it because you've been rolling for a long time.
197.00s: That sort of thing we want to avoid that. I want to avoid that.
200.00s: So that's why I'm going to roll cautiously. That doesn't mean I'm not going to roll it all.
206.00s: The reason why I say minimize it is because in my current portfolio, all roll trades forever.
212.00s: So I'm not going to apply that thought process.
216.00s: So this is general rundown of those strategies. I obviously have them in my options.
221.00s: I'm going to run segment. So you already can, you know, see a thorough rundown of these. This is just some general outlines.
231.00s: Next for the diagonals. Mostly going to trade them like a cover call. I'm going to be looking for the long to be at least 90 days to expiration.
239.00s: This is a good return on the extrinsic value.
244.00s: And it's going to make sure that the trade has a little bit of time to work out. I likely will be targeting six months at a true minimum or a leap.
254.00s: The long is going to need to be at least a 80 delta. I'm going to look closer to 85 or 90 depending on price and.
265.00s: Overall, I'm not expiration. The reason why I like such a long well, such a high delta for my long is because I want to minimize slash eliminate upside risk.
277.00s: I want to be able to sell calls aggressively. So I can collect more money in order to eliminate that upside risk.
283.00s: I got to make sure I have a high delta on the long otherwise sooner or later. Short call delta will overwhelm the long delta if it's a short if it's.
292.00s: If the long delta isn't high enough and then that's where you find upside risk.
297.00s: The other thing is I want to pad myself in case the underlying move a little bit against me. I don't want to find myself in a scenario where I then cannot sell short calls close to the money because of this.
310.00s: I also am going to look to short at a ratio. So the short strikes. I want to uncap my upside, essentially.
319.00s: And the other thing that's not on here is scaling in. I want to pick products that I can sell. I'm sorry that I can buy at least two leaps.
330.00s: And well, not necessarily leaps too longs.
334.00s: And I will look to establish with half up front and then add that other.
343.00s: Long option, you know, sometime in the future, depending on what the market throws in.
348.00s: And then the last piece is I'm going to be looking at things that on a three month or six month chart are trading around or a little bit lower than their mean yet are still strong.
359.00s: So fundamental analysis is going to be important for this strategy.
365.00s: And lastly, verticals, probably not going to trade many if any.
369.00s: And essentially the only time I'm going to look to put these on is if I have a strong short assumption that I want to play out.
378.00s: And for these, I am going to make sure I have good expectancy probably wouldn't trade larger than a dollar wide and on those I'm going to collect at least 30 cents.
388.00s: I'm going to be looking at trading of 40, 40 delta and down.
393.00s: But again, I'm not expecting to see a lot of these, however, not writing them off completely.
399.00s: So that wraps up a general overview of the strategies I'm looking to use.
403.00s: If you have strategies that you like to use in your smaller count that I didn't cover, let me know.
408.00s: Again, that's the point of all this so that we can learn from another. All right, catch you all later.
