2.10s: what's up everybody Eric here I am back
4.50s: again with David Hunter like I was just
6.48s: saying this is actually the fifth time
8.04s: I'm connecting with him we've set up
9.48s: this really cool quarterly Cadence and I
12.42s: was like actually explaining to him just
13.68s: like I did on the last video it's really
15.78s: cool to kind of get a download of what
17.64s: you're seeing right now get an idea of
19.74s: how different up and comings have
21.78s: impacted what you're seeing in your
24.12s: projections so there's a lot to talk
26.46s: about obviously as per usual I mean I
28.50s: started a YouTube channel like the
29.94s: perfect time because there's no shortage
32.04s: of drama almost every single time I
33.78s: connect with you so before that though
35.76s: as always welcome back thank you for
37.62s: joining us yeah thanks Eric thanks for
40.26s: having me back yeah I'm looking forward
42.30s: there's a handful of things that I'm
44.16s: really excited to talk about I want to
45.72s: talk a little a little bit about 2022
47.76s: then I obviously want to talk about 2023
50.22s: and looking forward from there but to
52.38s: kick us off keeping it in a general
54.00s: logical order looking back at 2022 what
58.38s: were some of the major economic themes
61.32s: that stood out to you
63.84s: yeah for sure the Fed was a dominant
66.06s: story
67.62s: um and before that Ukraine I think we
70.44s: came into 2022 I had expected a
73.14s: correction and and then a quick return
76.50s: to new highs you know maybe spend a
79.14s: quarter in correction and then go but
81.84s: then Ukraine hit and uh it changed the
85.50s: whole landscape it you know drove oil
87.30s: through the roof and it caused inflation
89.58s: to spike
91.02s: um and and from there it was as we say
93.86s: uh the FED took over so
97.14s: um yeah those were PR probably the
98.94s: dominant things
101.10s: um and we're still dealing with both
103.14s: obviously coming into this year the
105.72s: difference is the Fed you know the FED
108.60s: hike aggressively faster than we've ever
111.48s: seen them hike uh you know the rate
113.94s: increases that we saw both from the fed
116.16s: and in the bond market or the fastest on
119.40s: record and it was it's it's not so much
122.70s: the level of rates but the speed of that
125.28s: hike or that speed of that rise in rates
128.00s: that really has hit the economy and is I
131.40s: think going to hit it very hard as we
133.80s: move through this year so it's easy to
136.74s: get caught in you know historic numbers
139.26s: and say oh the interest rates are you
141.96s: know four and a half percent big deal
145.02s: um you know and we've been at double
147.78s: digits we've been you know we've been
149.46s: seven or eight percent we've been a lot
151.08s: higher than this in even not that many
153.30s: years ago
154.86s: um but it's that rapid rise from almost
158.04s: zero percent rates to where we're
160.20s: heading for five percent
162.12s: and I just don't think the FED grasps
164.76s: how dramatic an impact that's going to
167.88s: have on the economy and I don't think
169.80s: they really understand
172.44s: um that it's it's going to get there it
176.10s: just doesn't get there all at once so if
177.72s: you're looking at that and saying well
179.40s: we're not seeing the damage we don't
181.08s: think it's so bad I think they're going
183.18s: to be very surprised that all of a
185.76s: sudden they're going to see the damage
186.84s: and it's too late
188.24s: it's interesting that you talk about
190.20s: seeing the damage the recent PPI figures
192.72s: came out and they were significantly
195.24s: lower than what most people were
197.94s: projecting something to the tune of like
199.44s: 1.2 percent below the recent forecast do
202.80s: you think that that's part of that
204.72s: coming to fruition where we've had this
207.42s: really aggressive cycle and now we're
210.30s: starting to get to the back end where
211.56s: it's almost like the inverse where some
213.00s: of these metrics are just Contracting so
214.98s: fast and I'm is that what's happening
217.32s: here or are you seeing something
218.28s: different
219.24s: no it is what's happening I mean we we
221.58s: are uh you know even since last summer
224.46s: I've been talking about inflation coming
226.74s: down a lot faster than and coming down a
229.44s: lot sharper than the FED understands or
231.42s: then a lot of people understand you know
233.58s: we're seeing I mean look look what
235.08s: gasoline prices have done look what oil
237.24s: prices have done it took a while to get
239.82s: there you know I was beat up because I
242.04s: was calling for you know oil to fall
245.04s: back into the 80s and then lower than
247.32s: that and you know oil was still up in
250.38s: the hundreds and they're going you're
252.36s: you're looking the wrong direction it
254.88s: finally when it happened it happened
256.32s: pretty quickly but it took a while and I
258.96s: think you'll see the same thing in jobs
261.96s: and and a lot of other parts of the
264.00s: economy is yeah it takes a while for for
266.94s: it all you know for fed policy to work
268.98s: through the system and have its impact
271.74s: um when you know financials when you
273.54s: look at
274.80s: um you know we're just starting to see
276.54s: the credit deterioration in the banks
279.24s: that that's gonna hit hard I think by
282.18s: the second half of this year
284.52s: um and you know again the fed's kind of
287.22s: looking at it month to month and saying
288.96s: we're seeing deterioration but it's not
290.76s: anything alarming and we're not worried
292.74s: about it yet
294.12s: the problem is but you know policy works
296.46s: with such a long leg that by by managing
300.90s: policy that way you're guaranteeing
303.66s: you're going to be way late so yeah I
305.82s: mean PPI did not surprise me uh nor did
309.18s: CPI I mean I think we're we're at that
312.24s: point where you're finally going to have
314.10s: year-over-year numbers you know because
316.50s: the numbers a year ago were were high as
319.50s: those High numbers drop off it's getting
321.18s: lower plus if you look at you know I
324.54s: follow obviously commodity Futures a lot
326.52s: you know look at what you're seeing as I
328.92s: said gasoline but look what you see in
330.36s: lumber prices you know it was 1700 a
333.90s: year and a half ago and you know now
336.72s: it's you know down to 350 or whatever
339.74s: 400 so
342.18s: um you know those are huge drops and
344.16s: we're seeing that we saw it in Copper we
346.02s: saw it in steel prices are coming down
348.48s: hard so there's a lot of and a lot of
351.06s: the metal prices were coming down hard
352.86s: so there's a lot of things that you
355.56s: could tell that we were just you know
357.54s: you had to get that point where it
359.28s: really
360.00s: impacted the indexes and I think it's
362.46s: just starting so so the news going
365.16s: forward and people keep wondering
367.68s: how you can be bullish with all the
369.36s: negative news particularly the economy
371.04s: getting weaker as I expect
372.98s: the thing is that you can probably
376.92s: assume going forward not not every month
379.26s: baby but going forward you're going to
381.36s: have easier inflation numbers so that
383.58s: means the feds somewhere in here are
385.14s: going to wake up and say I guess we did
387.00s: do our job or I guess it has impacted
390.26s: but the problem is at the same time
392.70s: that's happening the economy is getting
394.68s: impacted and by the time they finally
397.44s: figure out uh that inflation's been
400.26s: beaten they've already done tremendous
402.72s: damage to the economy
404.82s: leads me to a follow-on question this is
406.86s: more of a personal one I've noticed it
408.54s: with a handful of economic releases over
410.76s: the past two weeks or so where the
413.40s: forecasts are whatever they are and then
415.92s: the actuals have a pretty significant
418.86s: variance this is everything from
420.60s: existing home sales PPI CPI unemployment
424.50s: like there's been a bunch of them so far
426.06s: I want to understand Beyond The
428.58s: Superficial you know yeah okay the the
431.16s: fed or you know the different entities
433.14s: that are tracking these metrics they're
434.52s: just guessing and they're way off like
436.62s: why are we so far off on these estimates
439.92s: versus actuals I'm I assume there's got
443.10s: to be more to it than just they were
444.90s: throwing some numbers in and it's just
446.10s: way off I just don't understand it and
449.04s: it's not bad at all I mean in fact I'm
451.50s: uh you know I don't try to forecast
453.12s: month to month
454.92s: um but you know the economists that do
457.16s: they've they're pretty good they have a
459.84s: pretty good handle on putting putting
461.64s: the indexes together and breaking apart
463.56s: and figuring out the various components
466.20s: the problem is
467.84s: you're getting to a point where you're
470.16s: you know I call it an inflection point
471.78s: but you're at a point where things are
473.22s: starting to break down so if you're kind
476.22s: of extrapolating or basing it on you
478.98s: know the gradual change that you're
480.72s: expecting all of a sudden you're you
482.70s: know
483.60s: things things happen slowly until they
486.00s: don't and then all of a sudden
488.82s: um things break in the other direction
490.38s: so I I think it's just that we're coming
492.84s: to the inflection point
495.18s: um not to mention also the jobs I mean
497.40s: you saw
498.84s: um all of a sudden they had a uh
501.60s: um they worked on the jobs and the the
504.26s: year over year number was way off I mean
507.36s: they had you know what they had reported
509.88s: over the past year was off by a lot and
513.24s: it some of its seasonal adjustment
515.34s: factors you know that that stuff is I
518.10s: just don't pay attention to monthly
520.32s: numbers like that particularly not jobs
522.30s: because you do see these you know all of
526.26s: a sudden once a year whenever they
529.26s: they find this big error and they adjust
531.06s: it so you know the feds actually
534.90s: managing policy
537.00s: by monthly numbers basically you know
539.58s: looking at that a monthly when that data
541.74s: we know all of a sudden either can all
544.38s: of a sudden change
546.18s: or you're going to find that data you
548.40s: were relying on needed to be you know
551.70s: was recalculated and found out it was
553.86s: way off so from reality so I just I'm
558.24s: not a big fan of managing monetary
561.12s: policy on a month-to-month databases but
563.58s: that's you know when they say they're
564.78s: dead at the dependent that's what they
566.52s: mean
568.08s: um so I'm yeah I'm much more focused as
570.54s: a strategist on Trends and knowing
573.54s: knowing full well that I'm timing wise
576.18s: it's going to take time and and I'm not
578.70s: going to be able to precisely know but
580.92s: you know that's to me trends are far
584.40s: more important than month-to-month dad
587.04s: which leads me that helps a lot that was
589.20s: actually my guess was that essentially
591.12s: there was some sort of typical scaling
592.98s: Factor they were using and then there's
594.66s: an acceleration essentially that occurs
596.34s: at some point that they kind of get
597.54s: caught with so it's it seems kind of in
600.78s: line with my general
602.28s: um my general guess another personal
605.04s: question that I have for you I've talked
608.58s: to a handful of friends and whatnot
610.26s: there's economists from all different
612.24s: walks of life essentially there's a an
615.42s: interesting theme I notice most of them
617.94s: don't actively trade some of them invest
621.00s: but most of them seem to not actively
623.52s: trade this could just be my small sample
625.32s: but is there why is that like why am I
628.62s: even seeing that small sample trend
631.02s: uh you're talking about economists
633.18s: generally or yeah
635.34s: I think you know again
637.86s: economists are
640.68s: um understand that month to month is is
643.92s: highly unpredictable you know they try
647.28s: to predict it but they're they also know
649.50s: themselves that you know they're not
651.36s: going to hit it right all the time and I
653.88s: think so they're they carry that over to
656.04s: the market where they think the shorter
657.78s: The Horizon the less predictability
660.90s: that's my view
662.60s: unfortunately retail investors come in
665.10s: and lots of professional Traders as well
667.58s: thinking the most predictable is the
670.02s: shorter time frame I'm quite the
672.00s: opposite you know it could be a longer
673.80s: time frame and I can tell you what I
675.24s: think is going to happen I think it's
676.98s: because economists and and you know
679.62s: strategists are looking at bigger
681.66s: picture you know it's it's again you
683.88s: know that old saying about you can't see
685.56s: the forest for the trees you know the
687.66s: retail Trader the retail investor is
689.52s: focused on the trees the economists and
692.28s: the strategist is focused on the you
694.62s: know the forest
696.18s: makes total sense and again my
698.10s: hypothesis where uh there is that you
701.46s: have to have a certain part of you
703.26s: that's at least partially unhinged to
705.72s: actively trade because of exactly that
707.94s: like when we look at just markets in
710.28s: general I can quantitatively display to
713.16s: you positive drift over 5 10 15 20 years
717.78s: show you that on short time frames other
719.88s: than sometimes post earnings but that's
721.98s: exactly what I was expecting it's just
723.42s: that it's almost like they know better
725.04s: and they kind of weight their their
727.40s: effort more efficiently than that but
729.90s: yeah I was just curious obviously
731.40s: because you're you're in that same group
732.84s: and you know far more of them than I do
734.58s: but yeah to be fair to good Traders and
737.76s: because there are good Traders out there
739.32s: you know they can you know their their
742.68s: methods are focused on short term and
744.72s: they can pick up things that have some
746.40s: predictability and you know you're
748.38s: playing probabilities with all of this
750.00s: anyway so it's not to say that some
752.64s: people can't be successful at trading
754.38s: they're certainly very successful
756.06s: Traders
757.14s: it's it's that the majority of retail
759.66s: investors
760.92s: have come in with almost a gambling
763.28s: mentality that represents they think
766.50s: they can kind of try to predict what's
768.54s: going to happen in the next week or
769.98s: month or a few days or whatever and the
773.34s: odds are they're not even understanding
775.20s: the relationships you know the the leads
777.90s: and legs the discounting nature of
780.30s: markets and the fact that what they're
781.98s: focused on they may be judging it based
785.28s: on news
786.54s: and that news may have been discounted a
788.58s: while ago so there that's why I think
791.16s: oftentimes investors are confused when
793.32s: they say well we got exactly what we're
795.84s: looking for and the market went down how
797.70s: come you know well it's because it's you
800.34s: know there's less times it's by the
801.72s: rumors all the facts you know it's so
804.00s: there's a lot of that too that goes into
806.52s: investing it's understanding that
808.26s: markets are discounting something in the
810.18s: future you know markets can be
812.70s: discounting six to nine months out that
814.62s: doesn't mean they are
816.08s: adjusting along the way but
819.06s: um you know thinking that today's news
821.10s: is today's market I think is a big
823.02s: mistake it's a really really good point
825.30s: it's actually something I talk out
826.80s: against a lot because I see people do
829.14s: that with earnings a lot so obviously
830.82s: I'm a derivatives Trader I trade a lot
832.38s: of options and people will say oh they
835.02s: they missed earnings why did it rally
837.08s: yep and it's you know that exact Force
840.18s: you're talking about another question I
842.46s: wanted to dive into with you because
844.44s: from a militaristic standpoint I have a
847.32s: general concept of you know essentially
849.42s: Russia invading Ukraine and the
851.40s: implications and I also had a fair idea
854.64s: of the economic implications at the time
856.68s: of with natural gas wheat things like
858.36s: that now that this is like still going
861.18s: on it's a pretty prolonged engagement
863.48s: are there any like longer term
866.16s: implications of this that me focusing on
869.10s: the trees I'm missing from the forest
872.28s: ask that again I'm not sure sorry
875.76s: um I'm primarily curious about Russia
878.40s: invading Ukraine when it first happened
880.98s: I was able to come up with a couple
882.90s: themes I understand the natural gas
885.18s: aspect of things the food aspect those
886.92s: kinds of stuff especially coming into
888.24s: the winter but I'm wondering since this
890.76s: has been a pretty prolonged engagement
892.20s: the market in my opinion probably has
894.72s: synthesized a lot of the implications of
896.76s: this but I'm really curious about the
899.88s: longer term implications of Russia
902.34s: invading Ukraine from an economic
904.20s: standpoint
905.22s: yeah it's a lot of it was just kind of
907.98s: early on obviously oil very quickly ran
910.50s: there and then you know it's been
912.30s: heading south since
914.76s: um you know weed and corn if you look
917.40s: the the biggest the bulk of the
920.28s: um the spike happened very quickly uh
924.06s: and I so I think what happens is you
926.40s: have an emotional response to it
928.32s: initially
929.64s: some are based on reality but it's it's
932.76s: emotional and then you settle down and
935.94s: you realize that these markets are are
939.54s: Global markets
941.22s: the oil is fungible it can find its way
944.94s: even though
946.86s: um you know the oil may not go from
948.54s: Russia or the natural gas from Russia to
950.76s: Germany anymore
952.38s: it's still out there and it it may go to
955.68s: somewhere so let's say it goes to India
959.34s: or China
960.84s: they that means they may
963.42s: um
964.20s: not need some of the oil they were
966.72s: buying for other sources so that goes
968.88s: somewhere else so you know these are
970.80s: Global markets and that the the other
973.08s: resources it's a global demand story as
975.90s: well so some of it is that that's often
978.18s: some of the you know what would
979.86s: otherwise be the operations or or
983.04s: um you know of alterations to what the
986.82s: normal landscape is
988.92s: um and some of it is I think
991.14s: we just don't know I mean you can
993.36s: discount things uh based on probability
996.66s: to some extent but as this drags on you
999.90s: know I get people constantly saying well
1002.72s: how does you know what if Ukraine does
1005.12s: this or what if Russia does this right
1007.28s: this happens what does that do to your
1009.62s: forecast and I generally don't answer
1011.18s: because it's like right I can't forecast
1013.16s: that you know I'm not going to play
1015.08s: hypotheticals I can't forecast I can get
1017.30s: you know the minute I say that then
1019.88s: you're going to say okay so you're you
1022.04s: know you're changing your forecast no I
1024.50s: you know you know war is tough to know
1027.92s: what you know you can't predict what
1029.96s: particularly with with Putin you can't
1031.76s: predict how long it's going to go on or
1033.86s: or those kind of things what I can do is
1035.84s: look at the markets and see the impact
1038.90s: that's had so far
1040.58s: and say unless something dramatic
1043.04s: changes yeah I think that's already
1045.08s: discounted
1046.82s: that makes a ton of sense and on that
1049.64s: same thread
1051.32s: is that why we're seeing natural I'm I
1054.32s: personally am surprised that natural gas
1055.82s: has contracted as much as it has in
1057.56s: price it's gone from like 10 and change
1061.04s: um towards the end of last year now it's
1062.96s: down at like three is is it because of
1065.48s: those alternate sources essentially or
1067.34s: finding their way into the global market
1068.86s: it's some of that obviously
1072.50s: um you know the storage was done ahead
1074.90s: of time so all the Doom and Gloom is
1077.84s: really you know we we knew they they had
1080.96s: filled their storage tanks that you know
1083.96s: Germany and and Europe were pretty well
1086.18s: prepared for this one or what what
1088.40s: happens going forward is a bigger
1090.50s: question mark but it's it is some of
1093.38s: that that you know the markets are
1095.36s: fungible it's also I think
1099.50s: um at least it feeds into my view that
1102.92s: you know there's a lot more damage being
1106.22s: done by these central banks underneath
1109.16s: the surface and that it's gonna it's
1111.50s: impacting demand you know two two things
1114.32s: impact demand one when prices run up
1117.56s: people people uh start using less of
1120.38s: something
1122.06s: um you know so when gasoline prices went
1123.98s: to five dollars
1126.20s: um you know driving became somewhat you
1129.14s: know people were more careful with their
1130.76s: driving they weren't playing as long
1132.14s: trips Etc
1134.24s: um and and the other thing that impacts
1137.30s: it is the economy and if the fed's
1139.58s: overstaying it's welcome on the tight
1141.38s: side the economy is getting weaker and
1143.54s: and I think is that's you know you know
1146.18s: I'm calling for a global bust later this
1148.22s: year it's not that we're gonna be fine
1151.10s: until we get there we're going to be in
1152.60s: recession and then recession goes into
1154.34s: global bus I think that's true of the
1156.80s: world you know the world's demand for
1159.38s: these items is being impacted by central
1163.04s: banks who were focused on yesterday's
1165.98s: problem yesterday's problem was
1167.42s: inflation I think tomorrow's problem is
1170.18s: deflation and they haven't recognized it
1172.82s: yet
1174.32s: got it and that actually touches
1178.40s: um kind of neatly on the next topic the
1181.16s: last few times we were talking the
1183.14s: general sentiment you were sharing was
1185.24s: kind of this parabolic rise into a you
1188.66s: know 80 plus global bust and over the
1192.92s: different times we've spoken there's
1194.42s: been different catalysts that have
1196.64s: intervened and essentially just your
1198.92s: analysis of that so it sounds like
1200.66s: that's still generally your forecast
1203.18s: here is that right and if so can you
1205.04s: just walk me through what you're seeing
1206.72s: sure yeah my view has not changed at all
1209.78s: I think we
1211.64s: um saw the end of the bear Market on
1213.32s: October 13th when uh you know the CPI
1216.56s: came out the market uh went down below 3
1219.62s: 500 in the first hour and reversed
1222.62s: quickly and we haven't looked back since
1225.02s: we you know we haven't seen 3 500 since
1227.66s: then
1229.04s: um we've we ran up to four thousand uh
1232.28s: we're right around that 200-day moving
1233.96s: average and it backed off
1236.44s: to you know before before
1241.90s: in December we we backed off to 3 800
1245.48s: and then in January we've run back up to
1248.36s: that 4 000 area and backed off to 3 900.
1252.22s: I suspect we are ready to break through
1255.32s: the 208 moving average probably next
1258.38s: week I mean we've Pro you know we broke
1260.66s: a little bit before we backed off but I
1263.24s: think decisively perfect through a
1264.98s: little bit next week
1266.20s: and probably see 4 300 pretty quickly
1269.84s: and not that long after that 4600 that's
1272.96s: kind of where I am in terms of the more
1275.78s: you know near term intermediate term I I
1278.60s: don't pretend to put as much faith in my
1281.24s: short-term stuff but sure I do think
1283.34s: we're probably ready to ramp up here and
1286.16s: that's kind of ironic in that
1289.22s: um everybody's thinking we're on the
1291.14s: verge of a meltdown you know that we're
1292.88s: we're going to see 3000 very quickly not
1295.70s: not so you move up so I think if we if
1298.94s: we do see what I'm I'm expecting here
1301.18s: it's going to cause a lot of
1304.16s: um because there's there's a large
1306.14s: majority of
1308.12s: um both Market analysts and investors
1310.70s: that are expecting down not up and
1313.34s: thinking that we're you know we're this
1315.62s: bear Market Rally's almost over and I'm
1318.50s: saying No this is the beginning of the
1320.48s: next Bull leg
1322.64s: um and that we will push through here
1324.38s: and once we push through that 200-day
1326.00s: with any
1327.40s: oomph a decisiveness it will cause at
1331.94s: least some of those Bears to begin
1334.40s: rethinking and saying I'm not so sure
1337.16s: this is the bear Market rally anymore
1338.66s: and then you'll stay to a bear Market
1340.52s: rally but have higher targets you know
1342.86s: say okay well it's going a little higher
1344.66s: but you know it's not it's not Off to
1346.76s: the Races But ultimately I think that's
1349.04s: what we're going to see is you can have
1351.08s: shorts having to cover you're going to
1352.76s: have people allocated to bonds having to
1356.30s: reallocate the equities and I think
1358.64s: that's what you know the first quarter
1361.34s: and probably the first half of this year
1363.02s: is going to be about is you know we
1366.68s: spent much of 2022 with people
1369.14s: reallocating away from equities uh
1372.14s: becoming you know as they became more
1373.76s: and more bearish
1375.02s: and in a fairly concentrated few months
1377.78s: I think a lot of that allocation that
1380.36s: reallocation that happened over say nine
1382.88s: months
1384.44s: um could could be reversed in say three
1387.68s: months and that's why I can talk about
1389.78s: such a big move as I think we're going
1391.70s: to have a very illiquid rally
1394.34s: um
1395.06s: or bull leg if you will uh because I
1398.48s: think it happens in a more concentrated
1400.28s: period of time you know the down
1402.20s: happened over nine months the up happens
1405.26s: over let's say three four five months
1408.98s: so it sounds like there's a couple
1411.08s: primary catalysts that would drive this
1413.42s: move for you it seems like some of it is
1415.70s: the inflation data continuing to show
1418.16s: some cooling which might put some wind
1419.96s: in the market sales it sounds like
1421.64s: you're talking about
1423.38s: um shifting of broader institutional
1425.00s: capital from risk off into more risk on
1428.06s: trying to catch the move and is or are
1431.84s: those the main catalysts that you're
1432.98s: seeing that would drive kind of the move
1434.66s: from like 4 000 uh say 46.
1437.60s: well those are the mechanical catalysts
1440.30s: I guess you know the it's
1442.40s: um you know position it repositioning
1445.64s: um and flow of funds is obviously going
1447.74s: to be important to any any Market rally
1451.16s: um but the Catalyst might be a weak
1453.44s: dollar you know the dollar breaking down
1455.48s: further uh the catalysts will be you
1459.26s: know the 10-year going from you know 340
1462.38s: to say 250 in the next few months uh as
1466.46s: as the weakness in the economy becomes
1468.80s: better known and probably the biggest
1470.90s: catalyst is going to be it's it's why
1474.02s: I've kind of um not been worried about
1476.90s: what everybody else is worried about is
1479.90s: work no matter what you think in terms
1483.38s: of how many more hikes there are or
1485.06s: whatever
1486.02s: the bulk of the fed's tightening is
1488.12s: behind us not ahead of us
1490.22s: and and you know we can we can argue
1493.34s: over how many more hikes are going to be
1495.32s: whether it's two more quarter point
1497.24s: hikes or whatever
1498.92s: they can't ignore this weakness in the
1501.02s: economy for much longer you know what we
1503.36s: saw in industrial production this this
1505.16s: week what we've seen in the ism reports
1507.68s: what we've seen in the consumer you know
1510.98s: it just they cannot just continue to say
1514.16s: oh our whole focus is on
1516.86s: um jobs
1518.36s: uh we don't believe inflation's beating
1520.88s: you and we think the stock market has to
1523.70s: go to 3 000 before we can ease I mean
1526.46s: those are ridiculous statements or
1528.62s: ridiculous ways to approach policy and I
1531.50s: don't think they're going to be able to
1532.60s: ignore the weakness for that much longer
1535.52s: so whether we get a quarter point hike
1538.22s: in February and another quarter point in
1540.26s: March whether we get a half point in the
1542.66s: quarter point uh I don't really care
1545.18s: I've said for several months now the
1548.42s: bond Market's going to lead the fed and
1551.30s: the bar Market's already telling you
1552.86s: that the fed's gone too far and it's
1554.96s: time to ease so that's exactly that
1557.96s: because I I follow the mob markets
1560.06s: pretty closely and it looks like already
1561.26s: the latter half of this year they're
1563.42s: looking to price in essentially lower
1565.16s: rates so what what's the defunct there
1568.22s: why are those two so decoupled well this
1571.46s: is always true I mean that's why I don't
1574.16s: like the Fed
1576.38s: um targeting the stock market and that's
1578.06s: what essentially what they're doing is
1579.44s: saying we're gonna we have we have an
1582.56s: opinion on where the stock market should
1584.42s: be
1585.26s: and we aren't going to stop tightening
1587.60s: until we get it there so every time the
1590.18s: market lifts its head I'll get to your
1592.04s: question in a second but every time the
1593.54s: market lifts its head out comes some of
1597.38s: the MC members or some of the you know
1600.68s: Paul's minions calling for you know more
1605.12s: hook you know they talk very hawkishly
1607.28s: and calling for more hikes and saying
1609.44s: we're not anywhere near done it's so
1611.60s: transparent they're trying to scare the
1613.46s: market the way they talk they're they
1615.98s: don't you know I call them Captain
1617.30s: Obvious I mean it's very very clear what
1620.18s: they're trying to do they're trying to
1621.68s: jaw blowing the market down because
1623.44s: they've bought into Bill Dudley's thesis
1627.56s: that you know we aren't going to beat
1629.96s: inflation unless we really tighten
1631.88s: Financial conditions and tightening
1634.28s: Financial conditions can't happen
1636.80s: without the market being much lower
1639.02s: so that's their that's their um focus
1642.32s: unfortunately I think that's their
1644.06s: biggest focus and then along with that
1647.00s: it's so we aren't going to stop
1648.80s: tightening until we see the jobs really
1650.60s: break
1651.50s: that's a heck of a you know poor way to
1654.02s: manage policy in my opinion but that's
1656.24s: what they're doing
1657.92s: um
1658.58s: and and markets lead the reason I
1661.76s: hate so much that they are focused on
1663.68s: the market there's a market is a lot as
1666.20s: a as a predictor they don't know in the
1668.72s: market doesn't always get right but in
1670.76s: the aggregate the market is a much
1672.38s: better predictor of the future than is
1675.14s: any Economist than is the fed and and uh
1679.34s: this bond market as well so stock and
1681.50s: bond markets I've said really since
1684.68s: early in 2022 in January 2022 I was
1688.10s: making statements about
1690.26s: um the bond market will lead and the FED
1692.06s: will follow
1693.08s: and that's exactly what we're seeing so
1696.14s: so the 10-year got up to 4 30 and change
1699.62s: 435 or whatever it was and is now you
1703.82s: know down at 3 40 and was down at 335 so
1707.42s: 100 base points lower
1709.46s: and the fed's still talking about higher
1712.40s: higher rates well I'll Trust the bond
1715.40s: market much more than I trust the stock
1717.44s: market I'm much more than I trust the
1719.06s: FED because in the aggregate the bond
1722.48s: market has a a history of seeing the
1725.60s: future as I've said it discounts the
1727.64s: future
1728.66s: so you know I don't fed has a lousy
1732.50s: tracker not just this fomc this current
1734.72s: makeup but fomc's and and feds forever
1738.74s: have had a lousy record when it comes to
1742.28s: predicting the economy and when to stop
1744.68s: tightening and when you know when to
1746.78s: stop easing
1748.28s: fed's not very good at that because
1750.32s: again they're backward looking they're
1752.18s: focused on data that is by definition
1754.28s: looking backwards uh telling you what's
1757.10s: already happened now what's going to
1758.48s: happen markets are forward-looking and
1761.84s: not not any one person not any you know
1765.26s: ten pundits but in the aggregate the
1768.14s: market law of large numbers
1770.30s: it's a discounting mechanism and it is
1773.42s: discounting has a good track record of
1775.94s: seeing the future better than than any
1778.28s: forecaster so
1780.44s: um so right now you are if you're
1782.96s: looking at the bond market you would say
1785.30s: the bond market is telling you
1786.56s: inflation's been conquered
1789.32s: uh or at least to a large extent and
1792.32s: that
1793.52s: um you know the economy is weakening and
1796.16s: that's exactly what I think so
1799.22s: um and meanwhile the FED is saying
1801.20s: inflation has not been conquered and we
1803.72s: think we're we're engineering us off
1805.46s: Landing I mean who who do you trust I
1808.10s: trust the bond market
1810.68s: um and you know stock market's a little
1813.74s: different story but the law Market
1815.18s: basically is telling you that
1817.58s: yeah and I think that that's really my
1819.98s: my point of confusion is exactly that is
1822.26s: obviously the FED can see that
1824.18s: themselves is it are they just trying it
1827.42s: seems to me that in a lot of ways the
1828.80s: FED is trying to maintain their Cadence
1831.56s: they've been super steady ever since
1833.66s: they decided that this was the path they
1835.58s: were going to take it's been almost
1837.98s: every single fed meeting the same story
1839.90s: is it literally just that that they just
1842.12s: don't want to change what they're
1843.62s: messaging until it's exactly time to
1846.20s: change because to me that's the part I
1848.72s: don't understand is the bond market is
1850.64s: already showing us this I know the FED
1852.62s: can see it but they're still messaging
1854.96s: something that's so far away from that
1857.18s: that's like the decoupling that I just I
1859.46s: can't understand
1860.72s: yeah it's a number of things first of
1862.64s: all they got burnt you know Paul got
1864.50s: burnt by being late to the game he he
1867.50s: you know he thought inflation was
1869.66s: transitory and he argued that uh into
1872.60s: this year and then got caught you know
1876.14s: flat-footed when it took off so and you
1879.86s: know there are lots of people
1880.82s: criticizing him for that
1883.16s: um and and it you know there was a lot
1885.32s: of supply side issues that were
1887.36s: contributing to it and then Ukraine was
1889.88s: wasn't necessarily predictable so you
1892.40s: know you got to give them a pass on some
1893.84s: of that sure but I think he took that
1896.24s: criticism to Heart
1897.98s: and again it's human nature and now he's
1900.08s: doing the exact opposite he's he's
1902.18s: saying well I don't want to get caught
1903.44s: in that place again he doesn't realize
1906.08s: the place he's going is going to be even
1908.30s: more criticism and I think more dire in
1911.60s: terms of its its impact
1914.18s: um but so it's partly that
1916.88s: it's partly history does show that
1919.70s: inflation
1921.50s: um if you if you uh back off from
1924.56s: fighting it too soon
1926.48s: you can get caught saying I shouldn't
1929.12s: have done that because you know yes it
1932.42s: came down but then it reversed quickly
1933.98s: and now I'm I've got an even harder job
1936.44s: trying to rein it in again so you know
1939.74s: some of his legitimate worry that if
1943.58s: they if they stop
1945.08s: short they're going to make their job
1947.60s: even tougher and and you know and then
1950.66s: don't forget
1951.74s: there's a cost to this if if inflation
1954.88s: isn't conquered and it does break out to
1957.86s: higher highs
1959.42s: interest rates are going a lot higher
1961.84s: and we have a government with
1964.82s: you know massive debt
1966.94s: that it could have it could afford maybe
1970.58s: a two percent
1972.68s: but it's gonna have a hard time
1974.66s: affording it five or six or seven or
1976.88s: eight percent I mean that's part of my
1978.74s: story for later on in the decade but
1981.74s: um
1982.40s: you know they they are there are
1984.68s: legitimate reasons for them wanting to
1986.96s: fight
1988.16s: my my only contention right now is that
1990.92s: I think they've gone too far uh that you
1994.10s: know their worries are the wrong worries
1995.78s: right now like I said I think
1998.36s: um you look at the inversion and the
2000.82s: yield curve uh you look at you know
2003.58s: what's happening in some of the
2004.78s: commodity prices like Lumber and you if
2008.08s: you know
2009.46s: um leads and lags the way I do you're
2013.00s: seeing all the evidence you need to see
2014.74s: to say
2016.00s: deflation is a risk not inflation and
2018.40s: they're just not there yet
2020.56s: but I think the next few months
2023.74s: it's going to be hard for them not to be
2025.36s: there they probably aren't going to be
2027.22s: in the deflation camp but they they may
2029.98s: get to the point where they say we at
2032.98s: least have to pause because it looks
2034.78s: like we've done some damage here we have
2036.40s: to pause and see how much damage we've
2038.26s: done or how how slow the economy is
2040.60s: getting so uh you know people again want
2043.72s: to focus on pivot and I go I'm I'm not
2046.54s: even my my aggressive stock market
2049.48s: forecast is not based on a pivot they
2052.42s: could or they may pivot uh more likely
2056.02s: they pause
2058.24s: um and that pause is going to be a big
2061.48s: that's going to be received in a big way
2063.88s: by the street you know if because that
2066.76s: what does a pause mean to the street
2069.40s: Applause means they finally woken up and
2072.46s: and understand that you know they may
2076.24s: have gone too far they aren't ready to
2078.28s: say they have gone too far but they've
2080.02s: at least and in the streets mine that's
2081.82s: going to be tightenings over
2084.96s: that's one bottoms and markets happen so
2087.70s: that's when you're going to see that uh
2089.92s: instead of a stampede for the exits it's
2092.98s: going to be a buying Stampede you know
2095.08s: in Bear markets you get this you know
2097.96s: somebody you'll fire in a crowd of the
2099.52s: theater and everybody's running through
2100.66s: the same exit and that's why prices drop
2102.46s: quickly in this case it's going to be
2104.86s: the reverse of that where right if if
2107.14s: everybody if if the FED pauses you can
2110.26s: have an awful lot of people who are on
2111.88s: the bare side reach the same conclusion
2114.40s: at once which is Gee fed tightening may
2117.04s: be over this is the time to buy
2118.90s: uh and then you'll see how liquid this
2121.48s: Market is
2122.56s: I think from a at least a Trader's
2124.60s: perspective I could not agree with you
2126.88s: more on that even the last few fed
2128.68s: meetings they're already the Market's
2130.30s: already saying oh this might be the
2131.80s: pivot we might be pivoting so I I
2133.42s: completely agree with you as soon as
2134.68s: they see anything that looks even close
2137.14s: to that it's going to be a broad
2139.24s: capitulation
2140.44s: um we're coming up on time I just want
2141.76s: to throw in the caveat because this is
2144.16s: you know just from my life on Twitter I
2146.68s: know this
2148.18s: um that does not mean it's straight up
2151.48s: to six thousand right you know you're
2154.12s: going to have stair steps along the way
2155.62s: you're going to have pullbacks along the
2157.24s: way but it does mean that all those
2159.70s: people say oh four thousands as high as
2161.50s: you're going and you're going back to 3
2163.42s: 000 or 3200 or whatever
2165.70s: it means more likely four thousand the
2168.10s: beginning of something take you like I
2169.90s: said the 4300 4600 maybe new highs and
2174.16s: where I think the real takeoff Point
2175.90s: comes and you may pull back from there
2177.64s: you know for a little while
2181.12s: um but the real takeoff happens I think
2183.46s: once we make new highs in a decisive way
2186.30s: that's where you get that parabolic melt
2189.04s: up so uh you know those that want to
2192.52s: believe that I'm saying from four
2194.98s: thousand to six thousand is going to
2196.24s: happen in 10 minutes I'm not I I don't
2198.94s: know how that the shape of that is going
2201.28s: to be it's going to be it's gonna be
2203.08s: fast and I think Steep and faster than
2205.12s: we've seen in history maybe but that
2207.94s: doesn't mean you can't have pullbacks
2209.62s: along the way that last for you know
2211.36s: weeks at a time so
2213.70s: um anyway yeah it's I think it's an
2217.24s: important note uh a lot of people
2218.74s: especially Traders were known for our
2221.44s: patients so as soon as something does
2223.30s: immediately play out how we want
2226.24s: um then yeah
2227.98s: um so we're coming up on time but your
2230.44s: your community
2232.12s: always lights me on fire if we don't
2235.00s: talk about precious metals so I refuse
2237.34s: to exit the conversation without asking
2239.86s: your view on precious metals which is
2242.08s: actually you know kind of purposely
2243.76s: placed this way one for jest but also
2246.34s: because I've been trading gold quite a
2248.14s: bit lately myself and I just love your
2250.60s: thoughts on that because the last few
2252.10s: times you had a really interesting
2253.48s: perspective on specifically gold but
2255.70s: yeah what are your thoughts on precious
2256.96s: metals as we sit now yeah I'm I'm very
2260.32s: bullish on the medals I think they you
2262.42s: know they've LED this year uh it may not
2264.76s: feel like uh uh at times because they
2267.58s: you know they ran up and then they
2269.32s: correct but
2270.94s: um we're seeing the both gold is is up
2274.06s: at levels that we haven't seen for a
2276.46s: while
2277.78s: um and and Silver's uh up you know near
2281.32s: 24. I think we are going to see a very
2284.86s: strong next six months in the metals and
2288.52s: um you know I'm continuing to call for
2290.20s: 50 to 60 and and more likely 60 on
2293.62s: Silver and 3 000 on gold in that 3 000
2297.66s: may or may not be aggressive enough but
2300.28s: that's where I'm at I mean I I think
2302.26s: that may be good enough but it's
2303.76s: possible given the move that I see
2305.98s: coming in silver gold could move even
2308.14s: iron that so I think we have a big move
2311.50s: in the medals coming
2313.42s: um part of it's the dollar part of its
2316.12s: lower interest rates par you know a big
2318.58s: part of that I think will be if you
2321.46s: could if you get the feeling the fed's
2323.26s: done tightening that's the most bullish
2326.14s: thing you can tell the metals markets
2328.36s: you know it's wind that you're back
2329.80s: instead of a new face
2332.20s: um and so I think that's all going to
2334.84s: happen the miners will be sympathetic
2336.82s: rallies with that with some big moves
2339.40s: miners typically you know in a bull
2341.32s: market in the metals the miners will
2342.94s: outperform the metal so
2345.34s: um you know you should have some pretty
2346.48s: good moves in the in uh you know gold
2348.88s: miners and the silver miners as well and
2351.40s: by the way is not just the precious
2354.04s: metals copper looks great here
2356.74s: um
2357.40s: it's another reason why it's a little
2358.96s: hard to be negative on the market
2361.38s: uh because you know if we were if we
2364.12s: were heading into you know the real
2366.82s: dumps copper would not be moving up like
2369.70s: it is so part of that is probably China
2372.28s: reopening uh no question but I think you
2376.48s: know I've been calling for six dollar
2377.80s: copper and I was saying that last year
2379.84s: when it looked impossible a company was
2382.24s: only going down but I do think we're
2384.46s: probably going to see
2386.26s: um six dollar copper so
2388.78s: um you know that that's another one that
2390.34s: should do well even the Steels look like
2392.02s: they're waking up so that there's a lot
2394.12s: and I'll tell you look at where the Dow
2395.86s: is that was not that far off of new
2397.60s: highs you know yes and NASDAQ has a long
2399.82s: way to go the SP has a long way to go
2401.56s: Russell has a long way to go the Dow
2404.32s: doesn't have that far to go to new highs
2406.18s: and it's you know to me
2408.82s: um Industrials
2410.80s: Commodities all those things look like
2412.72s: they're in play
2415.48s: I think it's really enlightening
2418.06s: especially to see kind of this broad
2419.74s: Orchestra of bullish movements and as
2422.68s: always you do have some audacious
2424.78s: targets which are always fun to to keep
2426.82s: an eye on and see how things play out so
2428.74s: first off again as always absolute
2431.02s: pleasure thank you for spending some
2432.28s: time you know sharing what you've
2434.68s: learned over decades with us where can

2464.38s: to sound like me but with some you know
2467.02s: sarcasm in it or you know trying to
2469.30s: start fights making it look like I'm
