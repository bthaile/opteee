0.00s: What's up outliers quick market recap. We got two things on the agenda. First we're going to talk about well the market
5.70s: Then we're going to talk about Nvidia and GameStop because GameStop just so close not quite and we'll talk about that in a minute
12.70s: But looking at the market really quick as a whole really interesting activity across the board
17.70s: Spy closed at all time highs
19.90s: 603 cues within striking distance, but still lagging and small caps is now also at three month highs
26.80s: Which is really interesting that small caps are now picking up a lot of steam on a three month time frame compared to cues
35.14s: VIX is down super low 13 and a half bonds up a bit Bitcoin also capturing highs it came in
44.74s: MBT it looks like it hit a high today of what 10,000
49.80s: 325 something like that. So overall super super strong performance across the board. So what's going on here? Well it looks like within the market
61.70s: There's a bunch of undertones that we can see and as you look across the different sectors you can see this coming out in HD
69.50s: so we're seeing real estate really capturing a
74.06s: Lot of trend strength here. It's approaching three month highs
78.22s: It's still lagging a little bit, but not all that long ago. It was literally at three month lows
83.66s: So this is a super strong move that we're seeing in real estate and then staples and discretionary that relationship is still
90.90s: Kind of interesting to me. We have XLP is still quite a ways off of three month highs XL
97.00s: Y is at three month highs
99.60s: So kind of just interesting undertones from a tech perspective. Com services is still the leader within tech and you can see XLK is lagging a little bit so
110.00s: Lots to do as per usual with the market. There's a ton to take a look at we'll get to GameStop and just man
115.48s: That's ugly candle, but we'll get to GameStop and just second. Let's take a quick look at Nvidia first and
121.24s: Nvidia's kind of been the talk of the town today and this week for a few different reasons
125.92s: It had okay earnings like there wasn't anything that stood out to me when it reported earnings that looked super soft anything like that
133.36s: It beat EPS it was expected at 0.7 came in at 0.81 and I know that this is a little lagged
141.84s: But you can see that the market definitely
146.20s: started reacting off of that and then we had some other highlights stuff like this where it was
154.50s: Really starting to take shape as some of Trump policies were being released and discussed and we're starting to
161.46s: Understand and have an understanding of what these different tariff structures might look like and for a while
169.22s: There was a lot of concern about some of the tariff conversations Trump was having around China and he actually came in a little bit softer
177.86s: I think that a lot of people expected to start now that doesn't mean that this doesn't ramp up in some sort of really big way
183.86s: But it does mean that the additional tariff on top of existing tariffs didn't come in as heavy as originally
192.42s: forecasted because
193.62s: Trump was throwing around some pretty big numbers for stuff like China. So
198.90s: We can see here
200.42s: It's this is from Benzinga and it says stock is up Friday and it reports indicating the US government is set to announce further sanctions on exporting
208.74s: semiconductor equipment and AI members chips to China, which will be less
213.30s: Strangent than the previous ones. So we also have a little bit of easing
219.22s: Across the board specifically any sort of sanctions that existed previously
224.90s: It
225.70s: We can see here it says US embargo will focus on Chinese companies that makes semiconductor manufacturing equipment instead of the fabrication facilities following protests
234.74s: so
235.86s: The semiconductor sector in general has been under a lot of fire
239.22s: We also know that there's a big big push for domestication of semiconductor production
244.10s: There's government
245.78s: initiatives and incentives to drive that behavior
249.70s: But the problem with stuff like that is it takes time. It's not going to be super fast
253.62s: In order to get a really well-defined and refined system
259.62s: To produce really quality semiconductors
262.90s: It really the supply chain component it takes time to build that that's why places like Taiwan have
269.46s: Such a strangle hold on it because they've built the infrastructure to get it down to an absolute science and
276.34s: Interestingly enough even something like semiconductors. There's a lot of
280.02s: Pass down knowledge in terms of the production process that isn't necessarily able to just be lifted and shifted super easily
286.58s: Getting the right experience around to do a good job on chips like that is not
292.34s: Simple
293.54s: So let's check out a little bit here. It says
296.82s: The fresh restrictions will follow months of negotiations between the US government allies Japan other lens and American chip equipment makers
303.46s: US chip companies including Nvidia and rivals had previously urged the government to relax
308.98s: It's embargo against China a key semiconductor market and this just goes back to show how intertwined the different countries and it's interesting because obviously from a military background
320.66s: We spent a lot of time war gaming against places like China because they're a massive threat. Meanwhile
328.26s: We literally struggle to manufacture chips without them which is
333.62s: A little bit scary if you think about it
335.86s: So understanding these supply lines is really crucial because there's a lot of really great trade opportunities
343.54s: Specifically and stuff like Nvidia that got beaten down pretty hard here
347.62s: It was at 152 and it fell down into the 130s. That's not a small contraction
352.58s: And that's a decent correction
354.58s: I think and it's something that I really like to the upside long term still
358.98s: You can see where my downside original target was just for a premature exit if needed
364.82s: And now this actually gets a chance to move up
367.78s: Because I think that long term it still looks really strong to me. It's just
372.82s: Fighting a lot of unknowns which can provide some opportunities for the enterprising
378.98s: Creators. Okay now over to game stop the reason why we got to talk about this is because game stop had a banger of a week and I know
388.10s: A lot of people are pretty bummed to see that it wasn't able to hold 30
394.26s: This doesn't concern me it really doesn't concern me yet because game stop has had a
400.66s: A insane rally
403.22s: From down here remember just the end of last month
407.78s: It was in the 20s and now it's in the 30s and I know again for people that are used to playing
414.66s: Super volatile stocks that go all over the place that can double in a month and stuff like that
420.34s: I understand this might seem less impressive to you, but this is great for me
425.14s: The reason why it's great for me is because it's good to see the company moving as a normal
429.78s: Company this isn't being overly driven by structural forces
434.66s: There's a lot going on in here and you can see this is the same
438.02s: I haven't redrawn this range. This is the exact range. I expected it to trade in
442.90s: For some time and it's not because there are round numbers of 25 and 30
447.22s: It's because I use reference ranges on previous
450.98s: places that it transacted heavily
453.46s: so
454.66s: What I think is going on here is profit taking and rightfully so that's what happens
459.38s: Is as something starts to appreciate and it starts to look pretty strong people that got in all the way down here are happy
467.46s: To take their 10 plus dollar gain in a few months and then move on to something else
473.62s: So kind of those weak hands get shaken out a little bit
476.74s: And then the stronger hands will continue to persist and continue to scoop it up
480.74s: Now the big thing for me is does it consolidate here and it's TBD big red candle today
487.30s: Don't like that candle today. It's not crazy, but a 6% down move in a day is nothing to scoff at
492.82s: So I would love to see these moving averages maintain this alignment
496.50s: You can literally see that we just got full MA alignment where it's a short term
501.54s: Above a slightly shorter or longer term above a slightly longer term above the longest term all positive sloping
507.38s: That's all good
509.38s: A lot's going to depend on how Monday looks. That's just how this is going to work because
514.18s: If it can consolidate in here, that's great news
517.78s: If this starts a massive retracement that's less great news and it is too early to tell from my perspective
525.38s: As always in the GameStop community
527.78s: Everybody's interested in being the person that guesses what something is going to do before it happens
533.06s: Which is always a fun game, but for me it's not the way I approach markets
536.58s: It's not the way that I trade because I don't really care
539.70s: What random guesses are I care about creating probabilistic assumptions to try to trade off of those
545.22s: So there's lots of people I've seen thrown different kind of numbers around and
549.86s: You know, you can believe what you want to believe there's nothing wrong with trying to forecast where things might go
554.90s: But just always remember right like price is right. That means whatever price is at the time
561.46s: Even if you don't like it even if you think it's manipulated. It is what it is
565.22s: So from a trading perspective you have to roll with that from a market structure perspective
570.42s: That's different. I understand a lot of the concerns people have with some of the pricing issues
575.46s: And we've been diving into that on the Saturday live streams where we're going through all of the old DD
580.26s: We have another live stream tomorrow going through GameStop and I can definitely see
584.90s: A lot of the concerns that people have rightfully so
587.30s: But I'm talking two different lenses. There's the trading lens
590.66s: Which is how do we
592.50s: Interface with something to make money as it moves and then there's the structural lens
596.58s: Which is where obviously we're taking a peek at some of the less
601.46s: Upstanding activity going on on the back end which that we don't like to do
605.70s: So let's take a quick look now at the options chain because I saw this pop up
614.02s: Interesting a
616.34s: So we had a few really big transactions today
621.70s: Really big transactions today
623.86s: So if I get rid of this from the week and I just look at today take a look at the size of these top few trades
629.94s: This is a 1.8 million dollar trade and this is a 532 thousand dollar trade those are big trades now
638.34s: We can see that some of these are still further out in time though, right?
642.10s: So these are out in 2025. So these are people playing longer term price moves
646.74s: Now I don't know and I haven't done the research on those forties
651.06s: To see where it's likely that they got in at
655.06s: But my guess is that's out of profit. That's a pretty healthy profit that that person just pulled down
660.42s: And again rightfully so because if
664.58s: We can do a little bit more due diligence on this in the in maybe the live stream tomorrow to see exactly
669.70s: Where we think these guys came in and at in what they're doing
674.34s: But this is looking like a really solid trade just straight profit taking but a 1.82 million dollar trade
681.06s: That's one of the biggest we've seen in some time
683.46s: This is abnormal that popped up on a couple my alerts and same thing with this 500k trade and
689.86s: This one also looks to be profit taking that would be my guess
694.26s: But it's hard to say because
696.42s: It's closer to the ask right so if you look the the spread here's 20 cents
702.34s: They came in you know right dead center. It's I meant to say it's not closer to the ass. Sorry
707.78s: it came in dead center so
710.66s: That really means we we don't know where this trade hit in terms of if they're offloading
717.62s: Or getting into my guess would be offloading and that's just because this is a standard place to take profit taking for positional traders like myself
725.46s: So I can totally see the angle here
728.50s: So all eyes on Monday to see if we maintain
733.62s: This kind of range and I think the range is pretty broadly defined at this point
738.18s: We have a little bit of leeway to go around
739.78s: But I'd love to see it hang out in here and then we do know that earnings
744.42s: Is now the 10th confirmed it moved out we could obviously see that in the options chain
748.90s: But they they confirmed it this time
751.22s: So we are coming into earnings soon enough, but we have a little bit more of a standoff distance
756.26s: if we take a look at
759.70s: The
761.06s: What is this one the sixth of December is at
764.74s: 118 percent vol
767.46s: 13 ds is at 140 and then 20 ds drops to 128
771.78s: So there's still pretty heavy vol in the front definitely around earnings obviously
776.26s: And the transactions today were really really really call heavy but take a look most of them
781.22s: Our calls that are being sold
783.06s: Standard profit taking there's nothing here that jumps out that I'm like super concerned thinking that game
787.86s: Stuff's gonna crash or anything
789.46s: It's likely game stop is gonna continue moving around as traders continue to trade what what else would we expect
794.90s: But it does have super heavy call oh i relative to put oh i which you always love to see and
802.10s: Keep an eye out for Monday if you guys want me to take a look at anything or if you have any questions
805.70s: Let me know be an outlier. I'll see you all later
