0.00s: Use a 30 day for our chart, GameStop. Notice anything about it? Anything special, anything
7.52s: stick out to you, other than the fact that it is parabolic up and right. It's gone from
16.36s: 20 and a half. It hit a high today of 28. I did a video on it yesterday, but I have to
21.36s: talk about it again simply because it's showing a lot of movement and the options markets
27.12s: are also getting heavily involved. There's a couple really important things I want to highlight
31.36s: as I look at this specific chart. Now, first and foremost, I don't do a ton of candlestick
39.68s: patterns, but I do look at candlesticks for the qualitative information that they can provide
45.60s: to us because they can do that. So, for example, if we look at a candle like this, it has a relatively
53.84s: small body where it opened here, closed here, and it obviously had much longer high and low
59.76s: wicks. What that tells me is that over the course of this candle's lifespan, which for those
65.44s: interested right now, again, it's a 30 day for our chart. So, it's a four hour time frame in this
70.24s: candle. It tells me that there is a really significant battle over price. It means that at some point,
77.36s: it opened here. It went all the way up to here, then enough sellers stepped in and then some
83.92s: to drive it all the way down somewhere towards here, buyers stepped in enough, and then they
88.72s: reconciled down here. That's a different story than the second half of what you see today.
97.92s: So, this is the candle essentially from 1030 Pacific time into the close. It opened down here.
103.44s: Notice how it has no tail to the downside. That tells me that this is voracious buying pressure
109.44s: up until it started breaking above 28. Then it stepped into moderate cell pressure. Notice how this
117.52s: candle split almost 50-50. It's 57 by 43 cell in terms of volume. But all of that happened in here.
125.36s: So, this is still really extensive buy pressure. And we've seen this sustained over a few days now,
131.68s: which I find interesting. The video yesterday that I did literally was talking about the importance
136.72s: of 25. And I even said yesterday, I genuinely believed that it would break through 25,
145.68s: simply because of the way it acted here. It popped above 25, got pushed down just below.
152.48s: And it means lots of people happily unwinding that started happening today, but take a look at
158.40s: the expansion in volume still. We've gone from 5.5 million here. Now 15.9, 25.7.
169.60s: This is where things are busy. Now, I know a lot of GME community members, APS, they are looking for
178.56s: MoAS, which hats off. I hope you get it. But for those like myself, again, I am very straightforward
188.00s: with you all. I have my positioning game stop, but I trade around game stop at the same time.
194.00s: The reason why I trade around it is because this kind of movement is really tradable. And again,
199.84s: in the video yesterday, I talked about the position that I built here in addition to my existing
204.96s: position, simply from the expansion of volume and trying to play at least a probabilistic move.
210.80s: And another note, people were asking, why did I enter here instead of something like here,
216.08s: or before when it looked like it was building a floor? And it's because I need movement. I'm a
221.76s: trader. This is how I make money is by trading. I need to realize the game in order for me to
228.32s: make money. That's how I live. So the issue with this is sometimes stocks can stay really quiet
236.32s: on these periods. So I don't like getting in during these for a trade. Now, if it's for a longer
243.60s: thematic position, it's completely different because this is showing you again, I didn't draw
248.00s: this line any time recently. This has been here for at least a month. And this we can see that
253.76s: there's a floor here. And whether or not it breaks through that floor is TBD, right? Price can
259.04s: always do whatever it wants. But the main point is that it didn't hear that's worth noting.
265.44s: So I enter here because it's a low risk trade in terms of how I structure the position.
273.44s: The risk on the position itself is set with an exit below this perceived floor, which is 2025
280.48s: ish, something like that. I had gotten in at 2173. So it's about a point in a quarter of total risk,
288.00s: which is trivial. It's tiny. So then you can build a much larger position because the risk
294.64s: is managed to the downside and then see if you can get a bigger move. It's about creating an asymmetric
301.44s: payoff potential again for the shorter term aspect of the trade. So I wanted to talk about that.
307.44s: So I got literally two emails about it, which are great questions. And I want what I do to be
313.28s: explained and understood by people so you understand when I'm analyzing this stuff, how I'm looking
318.16s: at it, because there's two very different perspectives that I see three actually with GameStop.
323.60s: There's the structural perspective in terms of its manipulation and the way that its
327.52s: manipulation is somewhat predictable to a degree and how that can be traded. The second time frame
333.04s: or the second perspective is a shorter term time frame, which results around trading these kinds
337.76s: of moves. And then the third perspective is the longer term time frame where GameStop is now sitting
343.76s: on literally stock piles of cash slowly starting to reinvent itself as a business. And I cannot
351.44s: route hard enough for GameStop to get through all of its been through so far because this was
357.68s: almost another victim of seller boxing, which is just shitty. It's shitty that that is the thing
363.52s: in people are that fucking greedy. So I love it from a long term perspective, because it's doing a
369.36s: good job reinventing itself as like a legitimate business. It's not just a charity case. A lot of time
375.20s: one of the things that supported GameStop for so long was a voracious investor community that
380.96s: was just like we just like to stock. We don't care. Fuck you guys. We'll stay here for three years.
386.24s: And for three years, the stock might do a ton, but we don't care. We're still here. And that's
391.60s: admirable because without that kind of support, GameStop would probably be in a different picture.
396.08s: But now it becomes an even more interesting story in my opinion because they just started
401.52s: the new branching out with card grading, which is really cool. Newton was teaching me about that,
405.44s: which is really neat. I don't do collectible cards. It's not really in my wheelhouse, but
409.28s: it's cool as a business line. And you can see that they're reinventing themselves. That's,
414.00s: you can't enjoy that enough. So we are seeing a really significant move here. That's what this comes
419.68s: down to. Take a look. Now it does look like the next serious volume node, right? We already broke
426.32s: through this one single day popped right above it. Didn't care off to the races. The next serious
431.28s: volume node really starts that it's going to interact with is this here. And this is using a six
436.96s: month daily chart. So it's looking at essentially the 27 to 28 handle something like that. If I go
444.08s: out to a year, you can see that that volume node holds. And it's already breaking through it.
450.08s: So the interesting part here is as it breaks through this, there's really not a lot of overhead
459.28s: support that's in the market. Now the reason why overhead support or I'm sorry, overhead
465.52s: resistance. The reason why overhead resistance is so important is because overhead resistance comes
470.72s: in the form of again, all these different traders that got in at really high levels that are selling
476.40s: because there are people that got in at 50 that are just happy to have an opportunity to get out
481.28s: even at a marginal profit if they continue scaling in which a ton of people transacted in here. Look
486.08s: at the size of these candles and volume. Thousands and thousands and thousands of people were
491.04s: transacting in this entire range. So there's a good chance a lot of these people will look to unwind
496.56s: here. But so far, it doesn't matter. The buying pressure is showing up. Now let's take a look at
504.32s: the option side of things because here's another thing that is incredible to me. Take a look at the
510.08s: calls 420 literally can't make that up. 420,000 calls again, 77,000 puts incredible, incredible
518.96s: call volume on the day. What's even more interesting now to me is the fact that take a look at how many
525.28s: of these were bought over 30% likely were bought because you can't tell on the mid, but some of this
531.44s: mid is going to be bought. Some of it's going to be sold. So definitely over 30% will have been bought
536.56s: of this total volume. So there are there's massive massive influx of calls coming in and
544.00s: take a look. They're short dated. So if you take a look at these different strikes now,
549.52s: the 30s had 53,000 contracts trade today. We have the 25s at 33,846. So what does that mean? Well,
561.36s: if we come in here and we start to take a peak at if we start getting near the 30s, it gets really
567.92s: interesting because the open interest here on the 30s is literally about to double. The existing
573.92s: OI right now is 23k. There's 53 K transacted today. So at least half of that is going to port over
580.24s: to new trades. It doesn't look like there are a ton of trades that were closed. So the only risk I see
587.28s: here right now in terms of like really starting to build out a big move is this is still heavily
593.36s: predicated on underlying transactions driving this. And I say that because the total open interest
599.92s: in here essentially from the 27.5, 28, 28.5, 29 is very light. So we obviously saw a bit of a ramp
608.64s: happened here, not significant, but enough to edge price for sure through some hedging behavior.
614.88s: Because this in and of itself isn't going to cause massive hedging behavior 33,000 were traded
621.28s: today, but the 1452 that were added over Friday, not a ton of activity on that just yet.
627.20s: So what I'm looking for is to see what this materializes into because take a look at these 28s,
634.48s: 16,700 volume today against 3000 OI. It's moving after hours. Just ticked up almost to 28. If this
645.52s: 28 gets gobbled up, that starts to look pretty aggressive to me because these again are a little
652.72s: bit weaker, but there's been so much added here at the 30s that it's likely going to force some
659.76s: hedging behavior. There's still pretty low delta. So it wouldn't surprise me if market makers
665.20s: tried to be cheap here. But again, the tricky part about this whole thing is that it's still not hard
670.00s: to borrow. So the access to shares isn't going to cause a restriction just yet. And there's not
676.96s: enough in this options chain to like really force a true gamma squeeze, but it can absolutely add
682.40s: some pressure and I fully expect to see that. Now a couple of other things. Take a look here. We
689.44s: have some serious size entering the equation. So there's some really big trades going down,
695.60s: and this doesn't surprise me by the way. You see these out in 2025, how they're moving. These
700.80s: are people that establish these. I have trades that are further out in time, literally for these
704.96s: kinds of instances, because what you could do is you can get them on for pretty cheap. When you get
709.52s: your move, you can unwind part of your position to cover the remaining costs of your existing
713.52s: position. So it's literally a risk free trade. So that then you can hold on to it up until
717.60s: expiration with no issue. And if you get a giant move, now it's a true asymmetric payoff potential.
724.40s: So seeing some of these longer term options coming off doesn't surprise me at all.
729.12s: What I am interested in specifically though are what's happening with this near, near expiration,
735.36s: this upcoming op-ex. The reason why this matters so much is because this is where the near term
739.84s: pressure starts to come in. And we can see a few things. I want to make sure I'm not filtering
743.68s: by any size. It looks like we're good. And I'm sorting by premium. So we can see that there's a few
749.68s: $100,000 trades coming in today. The reason why these are actually a little more impactful than
754.24s: I typically would give credence to this size trade is because it's for this Friday.
758.72s: This is for a really short duration. So these are really strong trades that need movement and
765.12s: they need movement fast in order for them to really show a profit. So you have a thousand of the
770.96s: 27s here, a thousand of the 27s here. Again, it's really, really hard to see because this almost
777.28s: looks like they were offloaded here, right? So it could be somebody that bought a thousand,
781.36s: $1,55, another thousand at two, unwind the whole thing at two thirty. They still made a decent chunk
787.04s: of change on that trade if it's the same person. It's a little hard to tell. So this looks like some
791.84s: near term trading activity to me overall. The other thing I want to take a look at really quick
797.20s: is just the actual dark pool feed on shares and see if there's anything that jumps out at us here.
805.36s: I haven't looked at this yet. And a couple, let me sort this by premium.
814.72s: Yeah, I mean, there's some big trades coming through. This is a little bit more to
820.32s: this is over the last, I want to say like 90 days it's looking. So let's restrict this to today.
827.76s: And we have three of them, four of them that are over a million bucks.
832.48s: So there's, there's pretty significant overall share volume here. Now let's take a look
842.80s: over the last week out of curiosity. And you can see, yeah, the bulk of these larger trades are
852.64s: really focused on today. So I just wanted that for general context. It looks like the stock definitely
858.80s: has some pretty significant volume stepping in no doubt. So next steps we need to see how this
866.88s: continues to run. I think one of the most important things to keep in mind is that this has pretty
871.60s: significant tailwinds right now, pretty significant tailwinds. And a lot of that stems from this.
877.20s: This is the Russell 2000 futures Russell 2000 IWM all of them looking at the same thing. But small
884.64s: caps are on a freaking tear. So this is finally adding wind to the back of GME, where for a lot of small
892.32s: caps, GME included, it's been wind in the face. And it's still been increasing slightly even in
898.48s: that contact. So on a longer term timeframe, this looks like the floor to me 19 and a half to the
906.72s: low side. It looks like about 20 and a half is being respected so far. And that's essentially been
914.16s: the case from the end of September. So we'll see where hopefully the Lord just continues to
922.40s: slide up on this thing because from a fundamental perspective, it kind of warrants some of it.
927.84s: And right now, the next threshold that we need to get through is going to be this block here,
935.28s: really. And it's not even that severe, the 28 handle. So that's what I'm looking at. As always,
941.52s: if you have any questions, anything you want me to take a look at, let me know, be an outlier,
944.64s: be an ape. I'll see you all later.
