0.00s: everybody. What's up, man? As per usual, right, is I'm trying to launch this thing, never
6.44s: had an issue before. And then it says, I don't have permissions. So I feel like that's
11.96s: just art and parcel for the game. Stop saga that there's always something going on. But
17.60s: I am stoked to do this with you, man. Thanks for spending the time to chat with us.
23.56s: Yeah. Thanks for having me on. I know it's a big deal to have a guest on your show. You
27.76s: never know what the person could say. So I appreciate you having me here and trusting
33.96s: me, especially with, you know, I know that you're new to the game stop saga relatively.
39.52s: Very. But you're really into options. And that's what you're crowds all about. So there's
43.72s: a natural kind of synergy going on here. So I'm as much here to learn from you as maybe
49.52s: you are from me. So excited to be here. Yeah, man. And well, it's funny because I think
55.60s: you give the platform a little too much credit. We are I'm pretty ratchet. So we can talk
60.96s: about whatever I don't care. So I figured to kick us off though, we could start really
67.00s: quick with a little bit of background on the way that you approach the GME space, specifically
76.64s: what got you into it and how you look at it now. And the whole point for everybody is
81.84s: just so that you understand our perspectives where two people talking about a thing.
86.36s: What we talk about are ideas, opinions, none of this clearly is financial advice. None
92.00s: of us are financial advisors. We are all just dudes looking at information, trying to figure
97.08s: out what's going on. And I think one of the coolest parts about both of our backgrounds
101.28s: is they're very different. But there's something that's very clearly joined us, which is
107.56s: the anomaly that is GameStop. So I'd love to start with that a little bit about what got
113.20s: you into GameStop and how you look at it now. And that's a great intro. I kind of approach
118.96s: it from two angles. The first one is it's a puzzle. As you said, there's like an anomaly
122.88s: here that doesn't make sense. So that's my number one is trying to figure this thing out
128.80s: obviously to then make financial decisions for myself. Right. But I think you said it
133.04s: really well. None of this is meant to be financial advice for anyone. The volatility on GameStop,
136.88s: we've seen just in the last two months, GameStop's been as low as $10 and as high as $80.
142.56s: That's crazy for a stock. And then there's bounce around to basically every price point
146.96s: in between there. So most people don't know what that feels like unless you've got shares
151.72s: or options or something writing on it. And then all of a sudden you're like, oh wow,
155.48s: this is a lot different when you've actually got money in the game. So the first angle is
159.60s: figuring out the puzzle and trying to use it to my own advantage. I would say, and then
163.36s: the second one is just telling the story because I feel like so often I hear things in
167.84s: the media or elsewhere. I'm like, that's just simply not true. And so I want to tell the
172.20s: story from my own kind of watching of it and see what's going on. And sort of that
177.24s: way when people come go back in time, like we've all done with I think Keith Hills live
182.64s: streams and various memes and everything else, you know, he told the story for a long,
186.76s: long time. And he was the only guy telling it. So, you know, I like to just think that in
191.44s: some way I'm following along with the story and telling it in my own way. But I do want
196.80s: to also say that I don't think I'd all represent the community. The GameStop community is huge,
202.20s: you know, at least 200,000 registered owners, probably a million plus people involved in this
207.76s: community. You know, some people are diehards. They don't want to ever sell a share until
214.08s: it goes to the moon. Other people trade options. There's such a big community. And I don't
219.00s: try to speak for anybody just speak for myself. Yeah. I think it makes a lot of sense. And I think
226.20s: the way that you highlight the the background of this story, it paints a pretty big picture at
233.40s: least in the way that you think about the the world that we're in and kind of the product that
239.88s: out. So yeah, I appreciate that very much. For everybody else here, this, I'm probably the
247.32s: most boring component of this whole thing. So we'll spend very brief angle on what I'm looking at
253.00s: this from. I'm a lifelong trader. I started when I was in high school back in 2007 and I've
258.76s: traded options my entire life. I'm 33 now. They've been a huge part of my life. However, I'm specifically
266.44s: looking for market opportunities as they occur, where they occur. And that's what led me to GameStop
272.28s: during the original activity we saw back in the early 2020s. I think it was a 21.
278.76s: Right here January of 2021. Yep. And the way that I kind of came across this, my side was more
286.84s: so anomalous market activity. I have a bunch of scans and screeners that I run all day every day.
293.08s: And when I find things that peak my interest, I speculate. And that's really what I look to do is
300.20s: capitalize on markets that are moving and offer opportunities, sometimes asymmetric risk profiles,
305.88s: stuff like that. So as I'm covering and talking about my angle on GameStop, I think it's really
311.24s: important to mention. I very much view myself as a guest in this community. I do not have the
317.56s: background you guys do. I do not have an even tenth of the understanding of all the lore. I have
323.88s: people teaching me what these different memes mean. I'm learning a ton, but there's a lot.
329.88s: So really the stuff I'm looking at is just from a kind of practical application of my trading skill
336.12s: set, which is centered in derivatives. That's what led to me, me into GameStop again during this
342.36s: most recent event. And I try to reiterate to people, I am not attempting to spread
350.84s: fud. I'm also not attempting to spread hype. I am a trader. I'm looking to find information
359.40s: that I can trade upon. So when I look at GameStop, there's kind of two very different sides of my
364.60s: brain that occur. The first part is from the technical perspective of trading. And then the second
370.12s: part is from this is the craziest story I've seen in a long time. And there's a genuine interest
377.08s: in the story. So it's a weird confluence of events for me because typically I'm very agnostic to
384.04s: product. I don't care what it is. I just want to know if there is an opportunity in there for me.
389.00s: And this is crossed those lines a little bit. So that's the primary angle that I'm looking at here
395.56s: just so that everybody understands where we're at. So I thought a good starting point would be
403.48s: if you could walk us through a little bit of the case for GameStop today as it sits today.
412.04s: Did you want me to tell really quickly my backstory on L. I got involved too?
416.20s: Yeah, please sorry because I kind of skipped that. So during late 2020, I regret not buying. But I was
422.92s: just kind of along for the memes. I was aware of Wall Street bets at the time on Reddit. I thought
427.64s: the memes were hilarious back then. So I was following along kind of keeping up with it. But I didn't
432.28s: understand what a short squeeze really was. I'll be honest. I didn't look into any of that. I went on
437.16s: what's what I call like an internet like detox. So throughout December, I was off the internet. I
445.16s: try to go only answer my emails at work. Otherwise, I don't allow any internet for a month. So when I
450.68s: came back, it was actually only because a friend had text me Elon's tweet saying GameStop,
457.32s: went on to Wall Street bets. I was like, oh my goodness, the story is still going. And then I like
461.80s: saw what a short squeeze was all about. I'm like, oh, this thing's going to go to the moon. So I'll
465.56s: buy some shares. So I bought some shares here on the 27th or 28th. I think it was the night of the 27th.
472.60s: So stock opens up, runs up to 483. I drive to work by the time I get back from or get out of my car at
480.44s: work. Stock's been dropped off a cliff. I'm like, oh, wow, what's happening here? And then I decided,
486.36s: well, back on my internet, hiatus here. So I went radio silence, kind of like licking my wounds,
492.68s: feeling really bad about myself. Until my brother texted me, it was on February 24th. And the stock
498.76s: ran up. I'll never forget it was like $196 in the after hours. I was like, okay, something's going
504.76s: on here, right? And then it ran up to like $350 later at March. And I was just hooked ever since
510.76s: because I couldn't explain how they dropped the price so low. But then what the reckoning was,
516.04s: like what was going on here in March and wait, February. And then the cycle on June, I'll never
522.92s: forget this either. I was teaching summer school, trying to make back money that I had lost on
528.12s: keep stop. And that was like how I made it up to my family. I said, I'm going to work extra to
533.88s: make this all back. So I just started pouring my heart into working extra. And then there's all
539.08s: these cycles ever since. And so I just started to investigate these cycles. And that's kind of how
544.20s: I got involved with the whole thing. I think your story seems like one of the many I've heard of people
555.24s: getting involved and getting top in it. It's representative of a lot of people I've come across. But
560.60s: it has a lot of unique qualities to it, which is really fun to hear about. That's one of the coolest
565.64s: things I find about trading, right? Like your background, your teacher, right? And then obviously
570.60s: you've progressed through your career there. I have a completely different background. Like the
574.44s: world of trading is fun from the jump because it is a band of freaking misfits that find our way
581.24s: into markets. And then you look in like the microcosm that is GameStop and it gets even more interesting.
586.84s: So now when you think about GameStop for you and the juxtaposition between
597.24s: making money as a trader and just the stuff that's interesting about GameStop,
603.08s: how have those two coalesced for you over your relationship I could say with GameStop?
610.20s: That's a really good question. So historically I grew up in the 80s and 90s and 2000s. So I remember
616.52s: GameStop as an electronic boutique. When this whole thing fired off I would say on Wall Street
622.28s: Betts. I didn't probably buy in because I'm a really risk-adversed person. So for me it was like this
628.44s: company looks shaky to me. So I got the Baratheasis right here. And I was pretty much sold on this
635.16s: Baratheasis. I'll be honest. I'll be, you know, we had a company at the time. This was four years
641.00s: ago that was losing revenue to downloadable games. They knew I used Steam. I used Epic. So I could
647.32s: see the problem here. I hadn't gone into an electronic boutique or a GameStop in over 10 years.
653.56s: Why would this company be doing well? Revenue per store is falling. They were closing stores.
659.88s: They had a lot of bad debt. Their leadership didn't seem to be doing anything about this problem.
665.96s: And there was no reason to choose GameStop over something like Amazon, Valve,
671.48s: Best Buy. There's no stickiness in this space. So they needed a way to transform what they were doing.
681.16s: That seems pretty obvious. Ryan Cohen took over the company and missed that because I was on my
685.48s: hiatus. But in his letters to the board which I would later read, he says all the same things.
690.04s: You know that the company needs to transform itself. Still does. They needed to stop bleeding money
697.32s: quarter over quarter. So that would have been the that's the Barathees system in that show right
702.44s: there. Right? So where do I like see GameStop now? Well, they were able to through the
709.96s: sneeze as we like to call it in January of 2021. Issues shares out and raise over $2 billion.
717.24s: So their debt problem is gone. They've got all this cash now to work with.
721.64s: They were able to trim costs substantially so that now they're yearly profitable. This took
727.24s: three years to do. Right? So the story from a balance sheet perspective and I was never
733.16s: one to read balance sheets. In fact, I was thinking about it today. I was like, when did I start
736.68s: reading 10 cues or 10 keys, right? And here I am pouring over to get every detail I can from them.
742.60s: And the company from a balance sheet perspective totally different now. Right? So the Barathees
748.20s: is $1 for $1 makes no sense now. There still are these problems though. They're revenue for stores falling.
755.80s: They don't have a reason for for for people to be sticky customers right now.
761.56s: But they're starting to do things like what they've done now. It's very small. It's the
765.64s: beginnings. But like with the tradable collectible cards like I've got just picked up a new EV by the way
772.20s: I was hesitating on if I should show it on the channel. But you know, they're saying PSC created
778.04s: what's up? Why is she not sure? Oh, here we go. I was like, do people want to see an EV on the
784.44s: channel? But here we go. Right? So that's my wife's favorite Pokemon Pokemon. I got to say
789.80s: Pokemon. I normally say Pokemon joking around with people. But I realized that would have been a
794.36s: big misstep here. So anyways, back to EV. So yeah, it's our favorite Pokemon also. So they're selling
800.44s: these PSA graded Pokemon cards. They're selling now these candy con controllers. So we're starting
810.04s: to see like the transformation happen. And the company starts to branch out in ways it's never done.
815.96s: So I'm excited about that. And then there's also the whole aspect of, you know, Ryan Cohn's on the
821.24s: board. He doesn't take any salary. He doesn't take any compensation at all. He just buys shares every
826.04s: year. You've got 18% of the company directly registered. That's never happened before as far as I
833.32s: know. You've got this legacy short interest that's got to be huge, honestly. And then we've got
840.60s: Rory and Kitty, right? So we've got the best trader. I think we've ever seen. I think you can
844.60s: probably agree. Best options trader we've ever come across and now owns as far as we know,
849.24s: nine million shares of GameStop. I'm waiting for another yellow update. Right? So the bull
855.72s: thesis is looking pretty good to me. The company's just got to take this legacy portion of its business.
862.36s: Right? Retail gaming, not the most glamorous thing in the universe and collectibles. And leverage
867.72s: that with the four billion dollars in cash it's got. And it's unique fan base to do something to make
873.48s: money. So that's basically where the story is now is the company at any risk of going bankrupt.
878.92s: I would say zero, right? So zero risk of bankruptcy lots of cash on hand. What can they do? And I think
885.32s: that that's what Rory and Kitty spoke to in his in his live stream just last month, which was stage one
892.52s: is done, right? Curved the cop, the curb, curb the bleeding, get the legacy business under control.
898.60s: Now we've got a C stage two, which is the transformation. And that's what I'm waiting for. I'm waiting to
903.40s: see that. We're just seeing like kind of the beginning parts right now, just experimentation.
907.40s: But I think everyone's looking for a merger or an acquisition. What could they buy that's
911.64s: going to make the company money? That's number one. It needs to be small enough to not be a big risk.
916.28s: I don't want to see them burn a ton of cash and lose a ton of value. But big enough to actually
921.00s: impact the bottom line of the company. Right. I see. And the pivots really interesting. I want to
927.40s: linger on that for a moment. But first I just want to shout out to everybody in the chat. There's
932.36s: over 600 people here to see you, Mr. Richard. So thank you for again taking the time to at least
940.12s: teach me and obviously share with everybody else. It's super awesome. But let's talk a little bit
946.04s: more about that pivot. There are a lot of companies blockbuster, Kodak, right, that are examples of
954.68s: companies that were kind of premier leaders in a field, failed to make a pivot. And then they
959.88s: had a big problem on a business. So when you look at GameStop and you think about the pivot potential
969.72s: and what kind of pivot would make sense to question first one timeline. What timeline makes
975.16s: sense for this to what does it make sense to pivot into? Well, you know, I hate to just always quote
981.80s: boring kitty, but he said it really well. It's been three years, right? If this takes more than
987.24s: three years, that's okay. But if it takes more than five years, that's not okay. Right. So
991.48s: the timeline is they need to start doing something here pretty soon. I think people's patience is
997.24s: not endless. We've got a lot of patience, but not endless. I thought the NFT marketplace was
1004.52s: a great idea. I know people that followed my channel when it was very small, you know, I was putting
1009.24s: out NFTs every week. I don't know if you know that. So I was doing my own drawings, publishing NFTs
1014.04s: using loop ring and then giving those away to people. I thought NFTs made a ton of sense for two
1020.20s: reasons. Number one, it was a way to take digital assets like in video games and make them collectible
1025.64s: and then transferable between gaming ecosystems. So people could retain their value outside of say
1031.80s: servers being shut down. So like, let's say you earned an item in Diablo Immortals, right? And then
1038.44s: that server shuts down and someone makes a private server where all those assets are still real,
1042.12s: right? And you can still use them. And NFTs for items or NFTs for games are right up game stops
1047.40s: alley because it's all about buying and reselling games at the heart of it. That's been game stops
1051.56s: kind of like MO or like identity for 20 years. So if game stop became like the place to go
1058.52s: for buying and reselling games that were an NFT form or in game assets that were an NFT
1065.00s: or form that would have been like the perfect way to take game stops existing like legacy
1069.80s: identity and make it modern, right? And capitalize on what was happening with NFTs. But NFTs went into
1076.44s: like a bad bad period of time, you know? A lot of it became very speculative. The kind of market
1082.76s: would jump from one chain to another to another. And it became honestly just like a ripoff Conor
1088.12s: is tub which looked really bad. And the SEC came down with a lot of scrutiny on NFTs and crypto in
1094.44s: general. And I think that the company kind of like took that whole idea, the NFT marketplace
1100.12s: and everything associated with it and just put it on hold. They were like, it's not the right time.
1105.32s: We could get ourselves in a lot of trouble going down this rabbit hole. And so they went to things
1109.56s: that, you know, are very similar. Like this is very similar to me. This is something we all know
1114.52s: and understand. It is on a blockchain because it's got a QR code and everything associated with it.
1121.16s: What someone else holds the key to that, PSA does. And it kind of prevents them from going into the
1126.28s: whole crypto sphere but gets them into the collectible space. So I think that's a good way to go.
1131.56s: But it's small potatoes right now to be honest. Like honestly PSA graded Pokemon cards is like I
1136.44s: think like a multi billion dollar industry right now. I know that in general collectible cards are
1142.04s: like an $11 billion history. How much can games stop pull in of that is yet to be seen. But right now
1148.68s: if you look at the volume of cards on the website, pretty small. I'm not going to change the fundamentals
1154.12s: of the company yet. Also something like this. So where do they, where do I see them going? But honestly,
1160.84s: I've said on my channel they probably want to go in a direction that no one would expect
1165.00s: to give them some kind of, I don't know, survivability started to talk so long on this is a good
1169.24s: question. Survivability in the long term. And like so with the amount of money they have,
1175.16s: $4 billion, they could just become a holding company. They could have another company under their
1180.04s: umbrella that has nothing to do with gaming, nothing to do with the collectibles that just makes money.
1186.12s: I would be happy with that too. IEP and Berkshire Hathaway are great examples. Very diverse
1192.92s: holding companies. So it could games stop do something like that. They've basically done that
1196.52s: in the past when they picked up all the mobile division companies. So they could do it again.
1201.00s: And they built a lot of value there and then sold it off for cash. So I don't know, I'm not
1205.32s: beholden to any idea. I know people are very focused on esports. I think that's very speculative right
1210.52s: now. I think it's risky to go into something speculative. I'd like to see them honestly just
1214.92s: wait because I think that macro conditions are right for a downturn and they could buy something
1219.48s: for cheap. I don't know what it would be. I don't know what Ryan Cohn has in mind. I've said on my
1224.12s: channel before, Ryan Cohn got into the dog food business. You know, it could be something very
1228.84s: unglamorous like dog food or something. And we'd have to like take his guidance on it or take his
1236.60s: kind of direction on it. I know Larry Chang is on the board and he's invested in companies
1240.04s: through his venture capital fund like US mobile. Right. So very unglamorous. We're talking about like
1247.08s: budget level phone company, cellular company. But if it makes money, it makes money. That's what I
1252.52s: most interested in. Good old if it makes dollars, it makes sense. When I think about the
1262.28s: building of capital, I find that entire world pretty interesting because they're sitting on
1268.12s: a lot of cash. And one of the interesting things right now about the cash pile is even at a moderate
1275.00s: rate with rates where they're at. It puts them at a pretty healthy spot. So when you think about
1281.64s: the timeline that they would be looking for in acquisition, is there anything that you've picked
1286.52s: up from your research that other than potentially waiting for a bargain of some sort, something that
1292.20s: comes across that looks really good? Do you think that there's some sort of imperative that they're
1295.96s: fighting against in terms of a timeline to make something happen with that cash?
1300.76s: Well, I would say I'm super excited for September obviously because we're going to see the
1306.04s: time that cash is on a balance sheet. So we're going to have a whole new look at this company right
1309.80s: here in September, probably around the fifth, where we'll see now like you said, about a 5% rate of
1315.32s: earn on that cash. That's great. There's going to be paid in on the equity, right? So it's not just
1321.16s: free cash. People paid into it and it's accounted for on the balance sheet. But what
1325.32s: what I'm looking at is a few things. I'm going to speculate a bit here, which I hate to do too much.
1329.24s: But there was a merger and acquisition position. What's that?
1332.92s: The tinfoil hat dog. I literally was going to make a tinfoil hat. Like get you put that
1339.00s: motherfucker on and speculate until your heart's content.
1343.56s: All right. So everyone in the chat is going to know way more than me on this. But I know that
1346.92s: GamesStop hired a merger acquisition guy, relatively recently in the last couple months.
1352.20s: Big signal. Larry Chang's been talking about like various things to do with mergers or acquisitions
1360.28s: or putting capital to use. Specifically, I want to say what he telegraphs was you wouldn't dilute
1365.88s: unless you had a reason to dilute, right? And also that dilutions can be seen as bad.
1370.92s: But if they increase the long term health of the company, they can be good. And if the time is
1375.24s: right, then you got to go for it. We also know that the lawsuit that Ryan Cohen was brought into
1384.68s: from the 2022 events was dropped or dismissed back here on June 11th. That's a big deal.
1391.64s: So I don't know if that lawsuit was holding up a merger and acquisition or holding up the
1396.60s: company from doing anything. But it's important that you know, they're lawsuit free and the head
1402.60s: of the company is lawsuit free going into anything that they could do. The other thing I would
1406.36s: mention is, you know, the last time Ryan Cohen bought in was I believe right before the shareholders
1414.04s: meeting last year in 2023 would have been right here. He had about 10 million dollars with the
1421.16s: GamesStop in 2022. And then 10 million dollars with the GamesStop in 2023. He hasn't bought any
1427.40s: GameStop since. And I think it's a hard ask for him to ask his shareholders, hey, I'm going to
1435.16s: dilute us 39%, which they just did. But then I'm not going to put my own money where my mouth is.
1440.68s: I think he's probably chomping at the bit to buy shares of the company, something stopping him
1445.80s: from buying shares. He became CEO shortly after that three months after that. So he's been CEO now
1453.88s: for almost a year. So I imagine that the CEO is going to be in the know on any kind of merger
1459.88s: acquisition that's going on with the company. Larry Chang and others might not be so let me
1463.96s: maybe that's why they were still able to buy. I don't think I have it on the chart still. But some
1468.12s: were back here. I know Larry Chang bought in about 10 or 11 dollars. He added to the chart. But
1473.64s: Ryan Cohen hasn't. And I know he's probably very much wants to. So something stopping him, he's
1478.60s: probably on a lockout. And I would just say that's basically my gut feeling on merger acquisition
1485.56s: news is that we're waiting for it to be cleared through the powers that be right. So when could it
1492.20s: happen? And that's the that's the great unknown for me, which makes this this is the the thing I
1498.12s: lose sleep the most over is when this announcement happens, what's it going to do? Because I know when
1502.76s: we talked, you would said generally speaking when a company purchases another company, the stock
1509.48s: price goes down of the acquireer, right? So the buyer. So could it have a negative impact on
1516.52s: games. If game top goes and purchases some other company, who would they be? How much are they going
1522.92s: to contribute? How much is it going to cost us? How much are they going to contribute to the
1526.36s: bottom line of the company? Those are all things I'm interested in. And then what's it going to do
1529.64s: to the share price? Right? And ones are going to happen. So and it could happen like we've seen with
1534.20s: any of this stuff out of nowhere, like literally it could happen. I don't know, it could happen on a
1538.44s: Saturday. Could it happen right now? Probably. So like I just always wonder about that. And then
1543.88s: correspondingly, when is Ryan Cohen going to walk by back in? Right? So this is a guy that's an
1549.64s: independent billionaire. His stake in the company is down down down to 8.6% from 13%. You know, like I
1558.36s: said, it doesn't send his shareholders a good message when you dilute them 39% and yourself.
1563.72s: So he probably wants to buy shares. He's got plenty of money with which to do so. How much is he
1568.04s: going to buy? And when's he going to buy? So those are my two most interesting things to look forward to.
1572.44s: And there's no timeline on them that could happen at any time. So I'm just waiting on those ones.
1579.32s: I see. So a couple follow ups to that then. And we have about 45 minutes. I have a hard
1589.00s: stop. So just giving everybody a heads up, I actually want to make sure that we get it
1593.08s: integrated as many questions as we can and whatnot. I don't want to linger on any 1.2 long. And if
1598.12s: people want rich and I, we were talking about it already and potentially doing another one or
1603.80s: some sort of Kate and sif if people are interested. But that's a that's a future us problem.
1608.84s: Focusing on right now, when you look at the share offering, obviously there's a ton of
1617.56s: conversation about the dilution and a lot of mixed feelings. A lot of people felt that
1625.88s: they were kind of done dirty, that that crushed any potential of a sneeze, which I now know
1631.24s: what that is because of you. Thank you. And I think I think people are really wondering how that
1640.92s: actors into thing, especially as we get a little closer to transitioning into more understanding
1646.44s: about your cycle theories. Well, I guess it's kind of a joint cycle. A lot of people that stop that.
1651.40s: But let's start with the share offering. What do you make of it? Do you think that that negatively
1657.24s: impacted the potential first sneeze if so, how and how does it feed into the FDD theory?
1663.88s: Okay, so that's a big question. I think the first thing I would say is that
1667.32s: neither of these two events we're going to cause more less. I need to start there right away.
1672.68s: So more less would be the mother of all short squeezes. Right, we can see that the stock price on
1678.76s: right here, May 14th in the pre market hit $80 that morning. That was on a Tuesday morning.
1685.72s: But it was on its way back down and they didn't offer shares until Friday the 17th. So the stock
1691.56s: price was already running down. Right, and then Rory and Kitty came in and started supporting the
1697.24s: offering by buying huge numbers of calls. Right, so two things to consider there. Number one,
1703.96s: they didn't stop any kind of an event. It had already happened. We don't know what it was
1708.04s: necessarily, but it seems to be like a gamma squeeze of some sort. And then the stock was like
1712.92s: pretty obviously back under their control. So I would have personally liked them to have issued
1718.92s: shares sooner, like maybe Tuesday morning, Wednesday morning, but instead they kind of let that
1725.16s: whole cycle play out. And then they really offered into the tail end of it five days after big volume
1730.84s: appeared. That's when they first start selling shares. And it was 50 million shares. They're 45
1734.92s: million shares. That's a lot. It's a pretty significant dilution and they were able to raise $933
1740.12s: million, which I would say is important because I wrote in the letters to the board, which I've
1745.56s: got open right here, I really didn't want to see them use their cash file for merger and acquisition
1751.00s: because you need, especially in this environment, high interest rate environment where the cost of
1756.44s: borrow is still high for corporations, you need cash to operate healthily for a company that's
1762.28s: trying to get their balance sheet under control. So if they are trying to do a merger acquisition
1766.44s: or something like that, I wanted them to have cash on hand to do it, not use their existing cash
1771.24s: file. So I'm positive on the whole event right here because they didn't disrupt a cycle. They
1777.40s: waited for the cycle to end. They're kind of telegraphing to the community. These cycles are happening.
1783.32s: If we can raise money into them, like instead of $10 at a low, like some companies do, dilute it
1788.60s: alone. Let's dilute at a relative recent high. And they even set in the prospectus, there's events
1794.60s: here that are not corresponding with corporate action. So we're going to seize the opportunity
1800.44s: and sell shares into it. So I'm sort of okay with this, especially because fails to deliver or
1805.24s: still appearing host cycle. So you can see XRT still has fails to deliver after the cycle,
1811.72s: game stops till as large fails to deliver after the cycle. We did see 20 million shorts apparently
1819.56s: exit their position during this. So reported short interest goes down, which you know,
1825.24s: if you're looking for a mother of all short squeezes, that's a concern. But I don't think if you're
1829.16s: looking for a mother of all short squeezes, you're worried about 65 million shorts going down to
1833.72s: 44 million shorts because you're pretty much convinced at this point that there's way more shorts
1838.52s: out there than are being reported. So this is probably to me a drop in the bucket for the overall
1844.36s: short interest. So then we get to the second dilution. I like their timing way better on this one.
1850.52s: I'm going to make a lot of people really angry by saying this though. So let me walk through the
1854.44s: second dilution. So we had an event happen on June 6th stock ran up to $67 in the after hours.
1861.88s: And then they immediately offer in the pre-market into it. And they sell even more shares this time,
1866.76s: 75 million shares at a much better price, $28 a share, raising to 0.2 billion or so. So much closer
1875.56s: to the peak, like basically almost right into the peak. I like this timing. This is basically what
1882.52s: they did on June 8th, three years ago. So I'm going to go back in time a little bit right here. So
1889.48s: June 8th is right here. So they had a shareholders meeting. Stock is running up to $350. They offer
1896.52s: right into the top of it. Netting themselves incredible money right here, putting in place all the
1902.68s: cash we had on hand to do basically stage one cleaning up the company, getting it healthy again,
1908.44s: and having money on the balance sheet. So they would not have posted a profit this past year.
1913.16s: Had they not done this? So this was basically a year or three years ago to the day. So I like this.
1920.12s: I also recommended it to the board in the letter. So I specifically said, have shares on hand with
1925.48s: which to offer into one of these cyclical events. Because again, I don't think this was Moas popping
1930.12s: off or any kind of squeeze. I think it's just a fail to deliver cycle. So we can kind of maybe pivot
1936.60s: into that at this point. The other reason I'm not super concerned about it is because you know,
1942.92s: they did this as Rory and Kitty was live streaming. And this guy, at the time, was worth what? $900
1949.32s: million on his position. He didn't seem too concerned to me in that live stream. I'll be honest
1955.16s: or any or surprised at all. And if you go back and look at his previous videos where they had offered
1960.04s: an S3 in December of 2020, he was actually encouraging them to use the S3 raise money because he thought
1967.00s: it could be really helpful for their transformation. And in this live stream, he basically says, look,
1971.72s: you're either thinking that Ryan Cohen is a doofus or you think that there's something going on here.
1977.00s: And what does he do? Cells his calls a couple of days later and buys a whole bunch of shares. So now
1981.88s: this guy is riding a sandworm in his meme. And he's got nine million shares of GameStop, you know,
1988.60s: as far as we know. Hopefully he's still got him. I don't doubt he does. You know, that to me is just a
1996.12s: huge signal of strength that a company can issue 50 million shares or 45 million shares.
2002.36s: Issue another 75 million shares. And the stock price has only gone up, you know, in that time period.
2009.24s: That's great. So all this is great to me. A company has even more cash on hand. They diluted 39%.
2015.88s: I don't know. I'm very optimistic about this. And their biggest non-bord member shareholder.
2021.88s: What did he do during the whole time? When from 800,000 shares that we knew about up to nine million
2026.12s: shares. So I don't know. It's all bullish to me. But I'm curious what you think.
2030.60s: Well, it's funny. The really the highlight of my perspective, you literally just said it. So I'll
2037.24s: reiterate it though. The fact that especially in this most recent offering, when I saw that that was
2042.20s: coming out, I was getting ready to closely monitor the price. And it's because I expected much more
2051.88s: of a reaction that was. So the fact that when they made that offering, it was literally eaten up
2059.80s: and the market really didn't care to me. That's supremely telling. And the other thing that I
2067.08s: can't help but find so interesting is what is the intrinsic value right now for games? I was like
2073.72s: 13 bucks a share, something like that. I think it's 1027. Okay. Got it. And when I think about
2082.28s: where that is juxtaposed to where price currently is, I can only imagine that the people that
2088.68s: really are trying to short game stop would love nothing more than to press it down here.
2095.00s: And the fact that it's not happening, I can't help but find that fascinating.
2100.36s: Especially when we look at the volume in GameStop over the last few weeks, it's been very,
2105.96s: very light on a relative basis, but GameStop has remained exceedingly exceedingly range bound.
2113.48s: It's hanging out. What it's hitting lows of like 2223 and then the peak starting from
2121.56s: 18th of June, the peak from there has been like 27 maybe. So it's been very, very,
2128.20s: yeah, very, very range bound and light volume and it's not getting pressed down. That's
2135.88s: very interesting. So when I hear people talking about the impact of the share offering,
2142.52s: it has an impact. There is no debate about that. That's an objective. But I don't know that
2147.64s: the impact is as detrimental as people think. Now let's dovetail that though into the FTD
2155.32s: conversation because I do think that does have an impact there because a lot of people I think
2161.72s: sometimes misunderstand market makers perspective and I'm not a market maker. I'm actually
2168.12s: really close friends with one that I asked him about this exact scenario and he did used to work
2173.72s: at Susquejana. He runs his own little firm now and he's been trading. I literally think for
2180.28s: 55 years and he's still market-making. The dude's been at this for a while and I was asking him how
2187.48s: he would have treated specifically a position like Roryne Kiddies and it was fascinating because
2192.20s: for a tenured market maker like that, his perspective is as you have an option coming closer
2198.04s: to expiration that's deeper in the money, you hedge it and you would be hedged leading into that
2202.92s: event. We know GameStop and the market-making firms for GameStop, it also shocker is a bit of an
2210.20s: anomaly and they do have a little bit of a history of under hedging in an attempt to make a little
2217.00s: bit more money. I would have to view though the recent jump in price against the kind of landscape
2227.80s: for GameStop with this fair offer would probably be well received by people that might be
2234.60s: under hedged looking to gain exposure. The tricky part for them though is they weren't really
2240.68s: getting in at a great price because price did not plummet but how does that impact your cycle
2246.60s: kind of theory? Yeah so I would say that if this is big F, right, if market makers are juggling
2258.04s: fails to deliver and they're juggling ETF exposure, they're supposed to deliver us on ETFs.
2263.88s: Just a quick offshoot there because I think a lot of people actually don't fully understand
2268.60s: the juggling thing in the last time you were kind enough to draw it out.
2272.44s: Yeah, I think that would be super kind.
2276.68s: So basically here's kind of my theory in a nutshell. So stock price is currently at like $24,
2284.28s: and what's going to happen is you're going to see a kind of ebb and flow towards Max Payne because
2288.60s: as we know the market makers are going to want to end this thing near Max Payne.
2293.88s: So that calls don't get put in the money, puts don't get put in the money and they could just
2298.28s: scalp all the premiums week over week, right? So you're going to see a trade into these Max Payne
2302.92s: Windows, something like this, but true by pressure, any retail buy orders are not going to affect
2311.24s: price positively, even something like Warren Kitty's purchase back here of 4 million shares,
2317.88s: right? So all these purchases, where are they going to go? They're either going to fail GameStop.
2322.92s: So let's put our GameStop fails up here. So this is a beautiful drawing by the way. So here's
2328.12s: our GameStop. Literally thinking if you do an NFT, these should be the freaking NFTs, dude.
2333.48s: Right. So they have two places to juggle. They can take these buy orders and they can fail GameStop,
2339.72s: right? Which we see in this column right back here. And I'd say what's really cool is post offering.
2345.64s: They were immediately failing GameStop to a high degree again, which is great to see, right? That
2351.40s: was something I was very concerned about. Are these going to suddenly vanish because they're juggling,
2357.24s: got cleaned up with the offering. I don't think so. Right. Where else do they juggle this? Well,
2362.04s: I think when they need more time, they can then pivot these fails to deliver into ETFs.
2369.32s: Right. So down here, we've got all these different ETFs. I think there's something like
2374.36s: 105 different ETFs that hold GameStop, right? So what they can do is they can go to a market maker
2380.44s: and then can say, Hey, make us a unit of XRT, which is like 40,000 shares of XRT.
2388.92s: And why would they do that? Right. Well, upon the creation of this unit of XRT,
2393.00s: this batch of XRT, they're just not going to put any GameStop in it. They'll put everything else in it,
2397.56s: chewy and all the other companies that are in it. But they'll pivot some of these fails to deliver
2401.96s: from over here to over here. It's a juggling act. So what would be the signal that they're moving
2407.96s: FTDs from one hand to another, you would see volume here. You would see the creation of ETFs,
2413.80s: and we see that repeatedly in this column here. So we can see big creation happening on the ETF here,
2420.20s: and we've been in a drought ever since. So that's also encouraging to me because it's showing that
2425.40s: they're not moving a position around with XRT. Why would that be encouraging to me? I think XRT
2431.24s: is already, sorry, I think XRT is already full. And someone asked a really good question
2436.92s: today on my channel. They said, what do you mean when I say that XRT is full? I mean, it's all failed
2441.16s: out. So XRT, we know has, let me pull it up here, 230,000 shares of GameStop that's represented in
2451.96s: its outstanding. So the most they can fail is 230K shares of GameStop. But that would be for the five
2458.84s: million shares of XRT that exist. The thing is about ETFs is you can short them to create additional
2464.36s: like phantom units, right? And XRT specifically is shorted 400 and something percent. So that basically
2471.40s: means you have to take this whole thing and multiply it by four or five. So you're going to have something
2476.12s: like 20 million shares or 25 million shares of XRT. So basically they can fail XRT to about 1
2483.64s: million shares of GME. And then it's done. They cannot fail XRT any longer. It's full up. And what
2490.60s: is it full of? It's full of cash because they're cash settling this ETF in hopes of someday down
2496.36s: the road, turning all that cash back into GameStop. But they don't want to do that yet. When are they
2500.76s: going to have to do that? And so the signal to me is that post share offering you can see right here,
2507.00s: they were doing a lot of creation of XRT. But then they failed XRT a whole bunch right during this
2513.88s: event. Right during the offering, they're failing XRT like crazy still. So for some reason they were
2520.60s: using like you said, all these new shares, these 75 million shares to do what I think they were
2525.08s: hedging options. Because it's expensive to hedge options. You have to go to the lend pool. They don't
2530.68s: want to pay the borrow rate. They said, Hey, we got a good idea. This roaring kitty guy is holding 120,000
2536.20s: or 12 million shares worth of options here. And we had big expertise here. Lots of options that
2542.68s: we're going to be in the money. So let's just hedge a bunch with these things, right, these brand new
2547.08s: shares. And let's not fix our T right away. So when are they going to fix XRT is basically the question,
2552.36s: when are they going to instead of having an ETF full of cash instead of shares at GameStop? Well,
2559.08s: they could pass it back over and fail GameStop a whole bunch. We've seen that happen in the past.
2566.04s: Or they could go to the market and buy GameStop. But if they do that, what's going to happen to the
2570.84s: price, it's going to go up really, really high, right? So this is where we see events like 6, 6.
2578.52s: I believe 6, 6 was them settling ETFs, especially XRT, getting shares back in there to basically
2584.92s: clean it up. So it can be their liquidity engine again. And they can use it to drive price down. So
2589.96s: June would have been one of those events. And then when would the next one be, right? Is the big
2593.88s: question, I think everyone would want to know, when is the next time they need to fix XRT?
2601.88s: Got it. Now this leads to two follow on questions. The first one that I saw that was really good is,
2610.04s: why do you think there was such a low in these cycle activities that have now since up back up?
2618.60s: Right there. Great. Great question. So I think there's basically the following ways to short the stock.
2624.28s: Right? They can go to the Lent pool. So how do you short a stock?
2630.84s: I'm going to actually type for once. I know it makes people mad.
2633.40s: Yeah, it's pouring. I actually thought that we were going to get a bit more creative drawing,
2637.64s: but okay, fine. All right. So way number one, you can short the stock as you could just go to
2642.84s: the Lent pool. They never want to go to the Lent pool, right? It's reportable. They're paying,
2649.32s: you know, a short percent. Every single day, they don't want to do that. So they could buy puts,
2655.48s: right? When they buy a put, a market maker is going to come in and hedge it. What's the market
2661.32s: maker going to do to hedge the put? Short sell the stock, right? Probably naked. So they could
2666.20s: drive this stock down that way. And it inflates the off-standing because the market maker is naked
2671.48s: shorting to hedge their position or they could fail to deliver an ETF, right? Which is what I
2678.36s: just described right here. This basically gives them not infinite liquidity, but near infinite.
2685.88s: Just like we saw. Go ahead. Just a quick note on the hedging puts. The way that you're talking about
2693.24s: hedging that is what we would call like a bit of a peer hedge. There's a lot of other ways that
2698.68s: they can hedge that position now. And I think it's important just to flag that. Again, it doesn't
2703.56s: impact this too much. I just see a lot of people apply the very strict approach of hedging with
2709.72s: pure hedges. And the reason why I bring that up is because it oversimplifies a little bit about
2715.72s: the way that market makers are going to manage their book. And it's never predicated on one single
2721.48s: position. It's always predicated on the entire book of positions across all products. So just a
2727.80s: worthwhile note, nothing incorrect at all, but just something other people should be aware of.
2734.36s: Perfect. And then I'll say the last one, the one we know the least about is right swaps.
2739.32s: So what is a swap? A swap is a derivative contract between a party and a counter party.
2745.48s: If it's an equity total return swap and it's to the downside, you're betting that the stock is
2749.00s: going to go down. So you could get huge exposure to GameStop to the downside. What's the counter
2756.36s: party going to do? They're going to hedge that position. They're going to go short with you
2761.32s: because they want to make they don't want to make the difference on the trade. They want to make
2764.36s: the premiums on the trade. So they want to make the interest that you're paying them.
2769.80s: So to enter a swap, you're going to have to find a counter party willing to bet with you that
2774.44s: GameStop is going to go down. That is just interested in scalping your premium along the way
2779.64s: and can make it short for you along the way. So what do I think happened to basically stop these
2785.64s: cycles from happening? Because we didn't see a cycle like this. I'll go to the chart here for a second
2790.12s: in a long time. So let me go let me go to cycles here. Yeah, while you're doing that, a quick note for
2798.44s: GC, they're just asking what a swap is. The way to think about a swap is it's kind of like a derivative
2806.60s: that's created between two parties. And it's a non-standard derivative. There is different rules
2813.08s: and underlines that can be part of a swap. So just for you to be aware of, just think of it as a
2820.44s: contract between two people with specific terms. Perfect. So here's GameStop's graph. And what I'm
2828.76s: going to show is these peaks that we were seeing back in 2021. Most of these high points back here
2834.04s: were probably ETF related cycles happening. But we haven't seen very many of them since we saw one
2840.04s: back here. We saw one here. And then this was the last one we really saw. This was in June of 2023.
2847.96s: It was it was like a small one. If it was even even a cycle, then we saw nothing since. And I think
2853.40s: the reason why we didn't see anything since is because we know that a lot of swaps containing
2858.60s: GameStop were entered back here in August to 2022. The only cycles after these swaps were entered
2865.00s: was the one I mentioned on Halloween of 2022. Potentially like a small one in February of 2023.
2874.60s: And a small cycle that happened in June of 2023 right after Ryan Cohen bought in.
2880.76s: Price ran up a bit. We had some fails that looked pretty distinctive. So how are they controlling
2886.04s: this? I think they were controlling this with long duration swaps. And we know that all the swaps,
2891.24s: all their expiry for all those different swaps that were in it was at the end of May of this year.
2897.56s: So the timing is just too perfect. So we know that there's just a couple of ways you can short.
2902.76s: We've got the one with the most visibility. But it's also a pretty good visibility. ETFs don't have
2907.96s: a lot of visibility, but the cycles seem pretty distinctive. And swaps are a long duration and huge.
2913.64s: Talking about tens of millions of shares. But we do know that they were expiring at the end of May
2918.20s: and beginning of June. And that's when everything started happening again on GameStop.
2924.36s: So to me, it's a question of where did all the cycles go? They were able to just say, okay,
2930.36s: our ETFs are full. We don't want this thing to blow up again. Had these cycles appear again.
2936.28s: So we're willing to pay a counter party a lot of premium. It's going to cause us to bleed out
2940.52s: over months and months and months just like in the big short as you're paying out those premiums.
2944.92s: And then they had to reenter. But upon reenering those swaps, either they didn't reenter
2949.80s: or the exposure or the naked exposure caused the cycles to flare up again. Because they needed to
2955.08s: they need to have the short position. The juggling needs to be somewhere. It's either going to be
2960.68s: an FTDs on GameStop, which they don't want to see. It's going to be on fails to deliver on ETFs
2965.56s: or ETFs go on Rakeshow, which they don't want to see. Or they got to keep paying premiums on swaps,
2971.00s: which they don't want to do. But once this expires, you're going to see everything else blow up again.
2976.76s: Yeah, I'm following. I think that makes it a pretty sound case. Now, when you think about
2986.44s: what takes off the activity, right, you've kind of outlined that pretty clearly. What kills the
2992.68s: activity? What forces us to kind of go into these really quiet dormant? And it's this. It's this
2999.96s: swaps count out. It's a swaps. Got it. Right. And you can or I'll actually mention one other thing
3005.80s: I wanted to make sure I mentioned. They basically need to find sellers. Right. So a swap to me just
3013.48s: represents a big bunch of sellers. When they enter them right back here in August of 2022,
3020.04s: the stock got crushed down because their counter party is going to sell. They're going to sell
3024.68s: shares. In this case that they don't own, right? They're naked short on the to hedge the swap.
3030.04s: Right. So the stock goes down because of all the selling pressure. When they re-entered swaps somewhere
3034.84s: around in here, what happens? Stock goes down even more. Right. So entering swaps is one way to cause
3041.96s: suppression of cycles, suppression of price. But another way is institutional ownership went down.
3047.56s: So we can see GameStop institutional ownership used to be like 99%.
3053.32s: But then institutions sold off throughout 2021. So back in here. So every time institutions sold
3062.44s: out, especially post November, the stock I hit hard because retail doesn't have that kind of buying
3068.04s: capacity. I know retail did buy like 75 million shares in DRS and all and probably owns like 300
3074.12s: million shares overall. But it takes a long time for retail to buy. If an institution just goes
3078.92s: out and dumps 10 million shares, that's very hard for retail to go and undo. Right. It takes months
3084.68s: and months and months. And that's why you see the steady like creep back up, I think. But I think
3089.40s: that what we saw was big institutional selling. But to me, a big bullish thing is that institutions
3094.28s: are now basically done. Like they've unloaded all their bags. If institutions want to get back in
3099.32s: on GameStop, they've got a long way to go. So this is like a contested space at this point.
3104.36s: An institutional ownership is that a low. I see. Let's pivot a little bit more now to the to the
3113.08s: cycles. We see a couple really big tendencies in terms of seasonality. You're walking me through
3121.00s: that in your track or quite a bit. Now this month tends to be quiet next month,
3127.64s: ends to have some kind of activity. What are your expectations around that? And can you also talk
3133.64s: a little bit about how you're counting the cycles, specifically the T 35. Okay. So let's talk about,
3140.84s: you know, and I want to say right away, I didn't come up with these cycles. So I don't want to take
3145.00s: any credit for them. I'm just trying to explain what other people have discovered. And it seems
3149.00s: right on the money because you can go back to like as an example. I don't know, I'll just find a
3154.92s: cycle. It's pretty distinctive. This one looks pretty good. The volume's not crazy high, but you
3161.32s: can see we were in a drought of volume here. This is February 6th. It's always at the beginning of a
3166.68s: month. And there's a reason for that. You can see that the price blips up here. This is a relative
3171.56s: high on price, $25. You know, decent volume. Everyone will remember these like there's key days in
3177.64s: the game stop histories like in the lore, right? When these happen, prices going bonkers just like on
3184.44s: June 6th and then crashes right off the top and gets shorted down into oblivion. So what happened here?
3191.32s: I believe if you look back, you're probably looking at, yeah, or signals right there. So this is
3196.44s: February. So what you want to do is you want to go back to not the previous opX, but the one
3203.32s: ripe up for it. So we're looking at December's opX. And what we're looking for is a signal here.
3208.36s: And the signal we're specifically looking for is fails to deliver on XRT. Other ETFs are probably
3213.96s: good too. But it has to do specifically not with the game stop fails, which there's good ones
3218.36s: here to see. But it's the fails to deliver on the ETFs. That's what we're looking for.
3222.76s: So what's happened here is what I believe happens is this is a monthly options X-Pri, especially
3227.88s: yearly like this. This is December, right? So lots of activity. There's going to be lots of puts
3232.52s: and calls going on here. They don't want to go and get game stop shares, although it looks like they
3236.68s: had to to satisfy this. And they failed a bunch of them. What they do is they go to ETFs and fail the
3241.96s: ETFs instead. So that's what I described on the picture here. So during a monthly options X-Pri,
3247.32s: a period like this, lots of demand for game stop. They don't want the price to run up.
3251.48s: So they do the Juggling Act and they go to the ETFs. So what do we see? We see volume and fails to
3257.96s: deliver on the ETFs going. Here's a little bit of high volume here on the ETFs. And then they're
3263.80s: going to have to reconcile this creation of shares that will have game stop in them some time later.
3269.56s: So I don't know why it works this way. I want to say this right away. I understand that it should
3275.40s: be 35 calendar days, but it's 34 trading days. So if you just go out 34 trading days,
3283.40s: it's usually 33 or 34 like right on the nose. And that's where the cycle happens. In theory,
3288.84s: why does this work? Hopefully people follow along with me here. I think that it's because it's not
3294.20s: one market participant that's happened here. It's two market participants. What happens is they
3300.60s: request the creation of the share of the ETF. Now that ETF authorized participant, that's the
3306.12s: person that makes the ETFs, the units has 35 calendar base. So that's going to take us out to
3312.68s: five weeks from here, which is going to be, so this would be actual calendar base. And you would
3317.56s: go out to about right here. But then there's like six trading days that you tack onto it.
3324.52s: And then a couple more trading days because of settlement and you end up here. So
3329.72s: this is sort of hard to say on the live stream, but I do understand that the rules should be 35
3335.32s: calendar days, but it doesn't appear to work that way at all. It's always 33 to 34 trading days.
3341.64s: And it hits it right on the nose every single time. So let's go to the one that would be the most
3346.28s: interesting. The one that roaring kiddie seemed to anticipate and kicked off everything we've just
3351.72s: seen. So what we can see is huge fails to deliver over the last year on XRT and all the other ETFs
3359.64s: and games stop importantly. So they were suppressing the stock as hard as they possibly could, got it
3365.00s: down all the way to 10 bucks. You can see that the fails are going crazy on XRT at this point. They're
3369.96s: not even following a pattern. They're just happening all over the place. But where you would expect
3376.04s: one of these like reconstitution of ETF cycles to occurs right here on May 3rd because that's
3382.52s: from options X free and March 34 trading days later exactly. So we go out 34 trading days. And again,
3389.16s: I know it shouldn't work like this, but it seems to. And all of a sudden you see huge volume out of
3394.60s: nowhere. And the price goes up like crazy. This is a classic May cycle. What did roaring kiddie do? He
3402.28s: bought calls as we all know right in this cycle millions of dollars with the calls. And they were so
3408.04s: cheap right there. It's crazy because we're incredibly cheap to buy. So that caused a gamma
3413.64s: induced event leading all the way up to $80 a week and a half later.
3419.08s: All right, so that's like a lot. That's a lot to process. I think anyone new to the story is going to be
3423.80s: like what just happened here, but it's crazy because you can go back years and years and years.
3428.92s: And you can find these cycles like here's one. Now quick note on that though. What do you think about
3435.40s: the instances where the cycle doesn't happen? That's a good question. So yeah, so right here,
3441.56s: classic case, big volume, big price improvement cycles clearly coming off of this opx where we see
3446.76s: used fails to deliver perfect case, right? And this is just some random month in 2014. But it won't
3453.00s: happen, right? And it should like in July. July is a really good case. Let's go to a July options
3459.16s: expiry where we see big fails to deliver on well, here's the fails to deliver here on this July
3465.56s: options expiry on game stop 4.2 million shares failed, but no cycle or sorry, it would be I miss
3475.88s: folk here. You would need to look at may options expiry to see a July cycle and we almost never see
3482.76s: a July cycle. So like right here, no cycle, right? Why? Why don't they ever happen? So let's go to
3489.96s: let me go to 2021. So we had a cycle basically every single month in 2021 except for July
3500.04s: and why not? So like you can go back here's 34 trading days or so after actually a couple days later.
3509.48s: After right here, we have look at the fails to deliver on XRT, right? This is a pretty classic
3513.80s: signal. These are may options expiry. Here's big fails on XRT. You should be able to count 33
3520.12s: trading days later and see big volume and price improvement. But you don't. Instead, you see
3527.08s: you know, relatively low volume, especially for 2021. And price is just getting hammered down
3532.44s: off its recent, my top of 56 here down into like the 40 range. So why, why no cycle on July?
3539.48s: And so what I did was I put a sheet here together where I looked back and I said,
3546.20s: you know, sorry quick interruption. There's a question on when does the cycle start? So what is the
3553.00s: actual? Yeah, like we should probably look at the most recent one. So look at May 3rd. That's a good
3560.60s: question. What you might see sometimes is something like, sorry, scrolling all over the place here.
3569.40s: So see how the day before somebody is epilepsy. See how the day before on May 2nd,
3576.76s: there was actually like a blip up in volume. That could have been because he was buying all these calls,
3584.36s: right? But so maybe there's options related to activity leading up to it, but it's typically a
3590.52s: corrupt just boom. We're all used to this huge volume pours in on a nowhere. And this is not like
3596.36s: what we saw with a DRS buy that comes in like every two weeks off computer share or a small little
3603.00s: blip and it fails to deliver. This is huge, right? But it's not OpEx. Someone just said in the comments
3608.92s: it starts on an OpEx. No, it's off of, I call it a tailwind because it's related to this March
3614.52s: OpEx that happened two months before or 34 training days before. But it's characteristic of being
3621.40s: in the first part of the month. OpEx is the third Friday of the month, right? So this is early
3625.88s: in the month and is somehow related to the events from the past. So good question. I went back
3633.24s: and tracked them all. So our data basically starts with one of these events in 2012. And there was
3638.84s: a June cycle on June 7th that year. And you can see that June hits consistently, like basically all
3644.68s: this time. So 66% of our June's we've seen a cycle happen to one degree and other yellows like a
3653.00s: maybe not a full cycle, maybe just like has some volume or has some price improvement but not
3657.48s: full. And same thing with August. But like July almost never happens for some reason and December
3663.32s: almost never happens. Yeah. And from a data perspective, some of that becomes anomalous to me,
3671.88s: like why it would be so seasonal. And there's a lot of intricate market forces that can of
3680.44s: go into the background behind that. But we have we have about 10 minutes left. One of the next
3687.80s: things I think we have to hit quickly at least is XRT. And specifically, what do you think about
3698.44s: XRT's involvement? You talked about the ETFs a bit already. But there was a couple questions
3704.52s: specifically about XRT. So is there anything special there as far as you see it?
3710.20s: Yeah, I think XRT has been a big part of the story since really the beginning. As far as my
3717.48s: data goes back here, you can see that during options related settlement on GameStop, XRT was
3723.08s: hit up every single time. Like here's an off-excelment period. This is July of 12 years ago.
3728.84s: The volume on XRT is crazy and the fails to deliver on XRT correspondingly crazy.
3734.44s: They've been using XRT as a source for a locate for shares for GameStop for decades.
3740.60s: For a very, very long time. But what's important is there's other companies in GameStop like Chewy.
3748.20s: Just recently, Chewy became GameStop XRT's number one holding. And Warren Kitty just bought
3756.44s: some large number of shares that GameStop confailed about 13G. At the same period of time,
3761.56s: this is very odd. The GameStop went from one of the biggest holdings of XRT to now only being 1.1%
3767.88s: of XRT. And Chewy became the biggest holding of XRT. Now, Warren Kitty's going after Chewy. So
3776.28s: what's the relationship there and what is Warren Kitty's seeing that I'm not seeing? Someone
3780.20s: posted something on SuperStunk today that's great, which is that of all the stocks in XRT,
3786.92s: there's a whole bunch in there, right? There's only three that don't have near 100%
3793.00s: institutional ownership. So let me pull that up really quick. Should be the top of SuperStunk.
3800.92s: Hopefully it's up here.
3810.04s: I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to find it right away. I know it's going to be right below
3814.36s: where I stopped scrolling. But basically, it's always that goes, right? Yeah. So it's interesting
3820.84s: that of all these stocks held in this very, very overshorted ETF, right? Institutions own like
3829.40s: 100% of almost all those ones in that basket. And GameStop used to be owned 100% 99% by institutions
3837.08s: because it was so overshorted, right? So it's telling me that all the stocks in XRT are very overshorted.
3843.64s: That's the only way that institutions creep up to 100% ownership, right? Because every time they
3847.24s: lend their shares, then they buy the back of same shares, and they keep increasing their holdings
3851.80s: as the share price plummets, right? So this basket of stocks, XRT, is unique because number one,
3859.16s: it's been moving between like 400% short and 1,000% short over all the time we've been watching it.
3865.56s: All the underlying are probably grossly shorted if they have 100% institutional ownership,
3871.96s: except for basically three companies. GameStop, Chewy, and this recent company that just got added
3876.68s: to it, I'm not sure even on the name. So somehow, roaring kiddies targeting the two companies in
3881.96s: it that aren't like institutionally owned 100% and why is he doing that? So it's just a huge
3887.72s: curiosity. But the only times that we've seen XRT volume, like we saw in the recent last six weeks,
3894.68s: like we saw 30 million, keep in mind, there's only supposed to be 5 million shares outstanding
3899.24s: of XRT, but we're seeing 30 million volume on it right here, right? So something's going on
3903.72s: with it. The only time we've seen anything even close to that was during the sneeze. So they immediately
3911.72s: went to, where is it? Oh, way off here. They immediately went to XRT right here for 30 million
3922.76s: shares back to back days. And XRT, you can see on the side here, immediately went on a rake show.
3928.92s: So for an ETF to go on rake show is a sign that like something's dangerously wrong. And we can
3934.20s: see that the sneeze took them to like that dangerous own right away. They immediately said,
3937.88s: we need to fail it into oblivion, get all these games.fails off of our, you know, right hand
3945.72s: and into our left hand. That's what everyone noticed right away. There was like a thousand percent
3950.92s: short interest on XRT and there was a period of quiet, right? Fails to deliver go away.
3956.60s: Volume's still pretty big. What stock price was really, really low. They crushed it down. But then
3962.04s: what happens? All the fails start popping up again, right? And it's just been a juggling act to
3967.24s: me ever since. And occasionally what's interesting is they'll fail other ETFs. So maybe they'll bounce
3973.48s: it to XRT for a while. But at some point they'll have to go to another ETF. Like I'm not sure what
3979.08s: this was specifically, but I've got a bunch of other ETFs tracking back here. So it could be
3985.40s: VTI, which you're probably familiar with or VT or IWB. But at some point they juggle away from
3992.84s: GameStop because their fails are getting too bad on GameStop, away from XRT because their fails
3997.96s: are getting too bad on XRT and they go to another ETF. And so you see the signal move to another ETF.
4003.88s: But this seems to be the ETF of like favor for them. And I'm not sure why that would be maybe
4009.40s: state street. Just doesn't regulate it as tightly as the other ones or maybe the LENFee is more
4016.28s: reasonable there. But it seems to be the one they always go to the most. They do occasionally
4020.92s: go to other sources like they did right here. Got it. Let's talk about the future. You and I,
4030.36s: when we were talking last, you had some kind of specific thoughts about August and also a shout out
4038.44s: to Crypteto who just donated to the stream. So that's super awesome. Thank you very much for that.
4045.88s: But looking out to August, what's happening there?
4051.88s: Yeah. So basically, if we look at what happened recently, we saw on 5.3,
4058.12s: this would have been an ETF-related settlement event. Right? Again, I didn't discover these or
4063.72s: anything like this. It would have been off March, so three, 17 or whatever, what are what are
4069.96s: what it was? It's to this event here. We saw the price run up, but the ETF-Fee anticipated it,
4076.04s: bought calls into it. And basically, rather than the stock price crashing back down to $10,
4081.08s: like we would have expected it to, it got caught in gamma and then ran off to $100 or $80
4088.28s: up something like that. Right? So there was a share offering into the tail end of it right here.
4096.04s: So a question that you had earlier was, am I concerned about the share offerings? Not really,
4101.96s: because if the share offering would have like killed cycles, then 6.6 wouldn't have happened,
4106.44s: but it happened anyway. Right? So we saw another big ETF-related settlement event of, again,
4112.52s: and what this is is they have filled up XRT with cash and other ETFs with cash. They desperately
4119.32s: need shares of GameStop. They don't want to fail GameStop a whole bunch, so they go to the lit market,
4123.80s: they buy shares on that Thursday, and then so it runs up and then Friday, they want to crush it
4129.24s: back down to Max Payne, because again, they need to get the shares into the ETF, but they need to get
4133.80s: it through the Max Payne window. Right? So the company offers. Just a quick note on that, because you
4140.44s: mentioned that before, Tuna, and I just want to clarify a little bit about Max Payne. I have a video
4145.08s: that goes pretty deep into detail on it, but it's important to note that market makers, they actually
4150.28s: don't have the leeway to just move price wherever they want to get it to Max Payne. Market makers
4156.20s: are really slaved to order flow. So I do believe that they have an incentive if price is close
4164.44s: to Max Payne to try to drift it there, but if price is like a wide margin away, they can't just move
4172.68s: price. It's just important for people to be aware of how Max Payne kind of affects the marketplace,
4179.16s: because it's a thing to be aware of. If it's close, absolutely on the table, if price, something like
4184.36s: this, if it's trading for $15, $20, if it's like 5% away, they can't move price 5%. So just an
4192.92s: important note. I think maybe games, not people might disagree, because we've just seen so many
4197.96s: days where these cycles hit on a Thursday and by Friday, sure enough, here we are right in Max Payne
4203.08s: again. Right? What's interesting is this cycle. Just a quick follow on to that, though. One of the
4209.64s: things that you have to track is where Max Payne is. So one of the reasons why you'll see that
4215.16s: tendency is because people are trading their option into expiration. They're trying to salvage
4221.96s: what value they can out of their slightly out of the money option. So that moves where Max Payne.
4228.20s: Definitely. I try to like on the sheet, you'll notice like I put Max Payne over here.
4234.28s: And when I start to see it move a bunch, I'm like, okay, the flow is pretty interesting, because the
4238.44s: flow is going to move the Max Payne around a bunch, right? Yeah, that's totally true.
4245.40s: So maybe something to mention before we get into the futures, looking again at the past,
4249.24s: the cycle is rarely end on a Friday because of the nature of the options X-Brief is going to be on
4254.76s: a Friday. And if you go T plus 6, T plus 35, T plus 1 or 2 or whatever, it almost never ends on
4261.72s: a Friday again, but it did in this May cycle. So very, very important. This May cycle for one of
4266.84s: the first times in a long time, May 3rd right here was Friday. So price ran up all the way up to
4275.56s: 1745. They were only able to get it down a dollar by end of day. So that caused, you know,
4280.92s: it ended way over Max Payne for the first time in a long, long time. And you can see what happened.
4285.80s: Like the impact of that was just incredible. So we can see why they don't want it to go too far
4291.08s: above or below Max Payne, because apparently in the weaker two to follow, it's just going to cause
4295.64s: a reckoning. So that's what we saw on May 3rd. Reckoning happened, went up to $80. Company issues.
4302.36s: We still get a cycle off of ETFs. I think there's some kind of deferral because of June
4308.92s: 10th. So June 10th to 619. And then 4th of July is another holiday. Both of these holidays landed
4317.56s: in the middle of the week this year, not on a Monday or a Friday. And I think for some reason,
4322.68s: when the holidays land in the middle of the week, it means that they don't have a reconstitution
4328.04s: event. So we're not going to see, I don't think, a tailwind on 7.9 like we should. So there should
4334.60s: be a cycle here on 7.9. But instead, it's going to skip because the holiday basically pushes it
4341.80s: to the next one, which is going to be $80. So that's my, my current theory is, you know, was able to
4351.48s: predict this one with pretty, pretty strong confidence because I had looked at the chart. We'd
4356.04s: had 66% of June's hit. July almost never hits. Whereas August is pretty consistent.
4365.80s: I love it. And I am at my hard stop. So I have to drop and that will wrap us up. But first,
4373.88s: I got to say, thank you so much again for the absolute download of information for everybody that's
4380.68s: here. I'm obviously throwing in Newton's YouTube channel, which essentially all of you already know.
4386.60s: So I'm doing that simply because it should be out there. But thank you so much, man, for hanging
4392.28s: out, for sharing a bunch of information. If you guys do want to see us do another one of these,
4396.36s: let us know. I definitely would love to. I love talking about this stuff and I love learning
4400.44s: from you because it's such a depth of information. So thank you very much, dude.
4404.84s: Yeah, thanks. I really appreciate it. And love it too because you have so much knowledge about
4409.48s: options that I don't have. And you've lived it and breathed it. And that's really the only way you
4413.24s: learn, right? The best way to learn is to do. And since I've never felt comfortable playing
4417.48s: options, I just can't speak with confidence to it all. And I appreciate you taking the time and
4422.60s: having me on your show. And I look forward to the next opportunity. Yeah, dude, absolutely.
4428.68s: All right, shout out to the chat. Thank you so much, Crypteto, for all the support and everybody
4432.52s: else hanging out. We were over 900 viewers, or watchers, viewers for the vast majority of it, which is
4437.96s: super cool to see everybody so engaged. It adds a huge dynamic and it's fun for us. So thank
4443.48s: you guys for hanging out. Thank you guys for sharing your information and knowledge with us.
4448.36s: Be an outlier. We'll see you guys later.
4455.56s: And we are
