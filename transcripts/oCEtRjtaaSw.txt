0.00s:  everybody. What's up, man? As per usual, right, is I'm trying to launch this thing, never
6.44s:  had an issue before. And then it says, I don't have permissions. So I feel like that's
11.96s:  just art and parcel for the game. Stop saga that there's always something going on. But
17.60s:  I am stoked to do this with you, man. Thanks for spending the time to chat with us.
23.56s:  Yeah. Thanks for having me on. I know it's a big deal to have a guest on your show. You
27.76s:  never know what the person could say. So I appreciate you having me here and trusting
33.96s:  me, especially with, you know, I know that you're new to the game stop saga relatively.
39.52s:  Very. But you're really into options. And that's what you're crowds all about. So there's
43.72s:  a natural kind of synergy going on here. So I'm as much here to learn from you as maybe
49.52s:  you are from me. So excited to be here. Yeah, man. And well, it's funny because I think
55.60s:  you give the platform a little too much credit. We are I'm pretty ratchet. So we can talk
60.96s:  about whatever I don't care. So I figured to kick us off though, we could start really
67.00s:  quick with a little bit of background on the way that you approach the GME space, specifically
76.64s:  what got you into it and how you look at it now. And the whole point for everybody is
81.84s:  just so that you understand our perspectives where two people talking about a thing.
86.36s:  What we talk about are ideas, opinions, none of this clearly is financial advice. None
92.00s:  of us are financial advisors. We are all just dudes looking at information, trying to figure
97.08s:  out what's going on. And I think one of the coolest parts about both of our backgrounds
101.28s:  is they're very different. But there's something that's very clearly joined us, which is
107.56s:  the anomaly that is GameStop. So I'd love to start with that a little bit about what got
113.20s:  you into GameStop and how you look at it now. And that's a great intro. I kind of approach
118.96s:  it from two angles. The first one is it's a puzzle. As you said, there's like an anomaly
122.88s:  here that doesn't make sense. So that's my number one is trying to figure this thing out
128.80s:  obviously to then make financial decisions for myself. Right. But I think you said it
133.04s:  really well. None of this is meant to be financial advice for anyone. The volatility on GameStop,
136.88s:  we've seen just in the last two months, GameStop's been as low as $10 and as high as $80.
142.56s:  That's crazy for a stock. And then there's bounce around to basically every price point
146.96s:  in between there. So most people don't know what that feels like unless you've got shares
151.72s:  or options or something writing on it. And then all of a sudden you're like, oh wow,
155.48s:  this is a lot different when you've actually got money in the game. So the first angle is
159.60s:  figuring out the puzzle and trying to use it to my own advantage. I would say, and then
163.36s:  the second one is just telling the story because I feel like so often I hear things in
167.84s:  the media or elsewhere. I'm like, that's just simply not true. And so I want to tell the
172.20s:  story from my own kind of watching of it and see what's going on. And sort of that
177.24s:  way when people come go back in time, like we've all done with I think Keith Hills live
182.64s:  streams and various memes and everything else, you know, he told the story for a long,
186.76s:  long time. And he was the only guy telling it. So, you know, I like to just think that in
191.44s:  some way I'm following along with the story and telling it in my own way. But I do want
196.80s:  to also say that I don't think I'd all represent the community. The GameStop community is huge,
202.20s:  you know, at least 200,000 registered owners, probably a million plus people involved in this
207.76s:  community. You know, some people are diehards. They don't want to ever sell a share until
214.08s:  it goes to the moon. Other people trade options. There's such a big community. And I don't
219.00s:  try to speak for anybody just speak for myself. Yeah. I think it makes a lot of sense. And I think
226.20s:  the way that you highlight the the background of this story, it paints a pretty big picture at
233.40s:  least in the way that you think about the the world that we're in and kind of the product that
239.88s:  out. So yeah, I appreciate that very much. For everybody else here, this, I'm probably the
247.32s:  most boring component of this whole thing. So we'll spend very brief angle on what I'm looking at
253.00s:  this from. I'm a lifelong trader. I started when I was in high school back in 2007 and I've
258.76s:  traded options my entire life. I'm 33 now. They've been a huge part of my life. However, I'm specifically
266.44s:  looking for market opportunities as they occur, where they occur. And that's what led me to GameStop
272.28s:  during the original activity we saw back in the early 2020s. I think it was a 21.
278.76s:  Right here January of 2021. Yep. And the way that I kind of came across this, my side was more
286.84s:  so anomalous market activity. I have a bunch of scans and screeners that I run all day every day.
293.16s:  And when I find things that peak my interest, I speculate. And that's really what I look to do is
300.20s:  capitalize on markets that are moving and offer opportunities, sometimes asymmetric risk profiles,
305.88s:  stuff like that. So as I'm covering and talking about my angle on GameStop, I think it's really
311.24s:  important to mention. I very much view myself as a guest in this community. I do not have the
317.48s:  background you guys do. I do not have an even tenth of the understanding of all the lore. I have
323.88s:  people teaching me what these different memes mean. I'm learning a ton, but there's a lot.
329.88s:  So really the stuff I'm looking at is just from a kind of practical application of my trading skill
336.12s:  set, which is centered in derivatives. That's what led to me, me into GameStop again during this
342.36s:  most recent event. And I try to reiterate to people, I am not attempting to spread
350.84s:  fud. I'm also not attempting to spread hype. I am a trader. I'm looking to find information
359.40s:  that I can trade upon. So when I look at GameStop, there's kind of two very different sides of my
364.60s:  brain that occur. The first part is from the technical perspective of trading. And then the second
370.12s:  part is from this is the craziest story I've seen in a long time. And there's a genuine interest
377.08s:  in the story. So it's a weird confluence of events for me because typically I'm very agnostic to
384.04s:  product. I don't care what it is. I just want to know if there is an opportunity in there for me.
389.00s:  And this is crossed those lines a little bit. So that's the primary angle that I'm looking at here
395.56s:  just so that everybody understands where we're at. So I thought a good starting point would be
403.48s:  if you could walk us through a little bit of the case for GameStop today as it sits today.
412.04s:  Did you want me to tell really quickly my backstory on L. I got involved too?
416.20s:  Yeah, please sorry because I kind of skipped that. So during late 2020, I regret not buying. But I was
422.92s:  just kind of along for the memes. I was aware of Wall Street bets at the time on Reddit. I thought
427.64s:  the memes were hilarious back then. So I was following along kind of keeping up with it. But I didn't
432.28s:  understand what a short squeeze really was. I'll be honest. I didn't look into any of that. I went on
437.16s:  what's what I call like an internet like detox. So throughout December, I was off the internet. I
445.16s:  try to go only answer my emails at work. Otherwise, I don't allow any internet for a month. So when I
450.68s:  came back, it was actually only because a friend had text me Elon's tweet saying GameStop,
457.32s:  went on to Wall Street bets. I was like, oh my goodness, the story is still going. And then I like
461.80s:  saw what a short squeeze was all about. I'm like, oh, this thing's going to go to the moon. So I'll
465.56s:  buy some shares. So I bought some shares here on the 27th or 28th. I think it was the night of the 27th.
472.60s:  So stock opens up, runs up to 483. I drive to work by the time I get back from or get out of my car
480.44s:  at work. Stock's been dropped off a cliff. I'm like, oh, wow, what's happening here? And then I
486.12s:  decided, well, back on my internet, hiatus here. So I went radio silence, kind of like licking my wounds,
492.68s:  feeling really bad about myself. Until my brother texted me, it was on February 24th. And the stock ran
499.08s:  up. I'll never forget it was like $196 in the after hours. I was like, okay, something's going on
504.92s:  here, right? And then it ran up to like $350 later at March. And I was just hooked ever since because
511.00s:  I couldn't explain how they dropped the price so low. But then what the reckoning was,
516.04s:  like what was going on here in March and wait, February. And then the cycle on June. I'll never
522.84s:  forget this either. I was teaching summer school, trying to make back money that I had lost on
528.12s:  Cape Star. And that was like how I made it up to my family. I said, I'm going to work extra
533.72s:  to make this all back. So I just started pouring my heart into working extra. And then there's all
539.16s:  these cycles ever since. And so I just started to investigate these cycles. And that's kind of how
544.12s:  I got involved with the whole thing. I think your story seems like one of the many I've heard of people
555.24s:  getting involved and getting top in it. It's representative of a lot of people I've come across. But
560.52s:  it has a lot of unique qualities to it, which is really fun to hear about. That's one of the coolest
565.64s:  things I find about trading, right? Like your background, your teacher, right? And then obviously
570.60s:  you've progressed through your career there. I have a completely different background. Like the
574.44s:  world of trading is fun from the jump because it is a band of freaking misfits that find our way
581.24s:  into markets. And then you look in like the microcosm that is GameStop and it gets even more interesting.
586.84s:  So now when you think about GameStop for you and the juxtaposition between
597.24s:  making money as a trader and just the stuff that's interesting about GameStop,
603.08s:  how have those two coalesced for you over your relationship I could say with GameStop?
610.20s:  That's a really good question. So historically I grew up in the 80s and 90s and 2000s. So I remember
616.52s:  GameStop as an electronic boutique. When this whole thing fired off I would say on Wall Street
622.28s:  Betts. I didn't probably buy in because I'm a really risk-adversed person. So for me it was like this
628.44s:  company looks shaky to me. So I got the Baratheasis right here. And I was pretty much sold on this
635.16s:  Baratheasis. I'll be honest. I'll be, you know, we had a company at the time. This was four years
641.00s:  ago that was losing revenue to downloadable games. They knew I used Steam. I used Epic. So I could
647.32s:  see the problem here. I hadn't gone into an electronic boutique or a GameStop in over 10 years.
653.56s:  Why would this company be doing well? Revenue per store is falling. They were closing stores.
659.88s:  They had a lot of bad debt. Their leadership didn't seem to be doing anything about this problem.
665.96s:  And there was no reason to choose GameStop over something like Amazon, Valve,
671.48s:  Best Buy. There's no stickiness in this space. So they needed a way to transform what they were doing.
681.16s:  That seems pretty obvious. Ryan Cohen took over the company and missed that because I was on my
685.48s:  hiatus. But in his letters to the board which I would later read, he says all the same things.
690.04s:  You know that the company needs to transform itself. Still does. They needed to stop bleeding money
697.32s:  quarter over quarter. So that would have been the that's the Barathees system in the nutshell right
702.44s:  there. Right? So where do I like see GameStop now? Well, they were able to through the
709.96s:  sneeze as we like to call it in January of 2021. Issues shares out and raise over $2 billion.
717.24s:  So their debt problem is gone. They've got all this cash now to work with.
721.64s:  They were able to trim costs substantially so that now they're yearly profitable. This took
727.24s:  three years to do. Right? So the story from a balance sheet perspective and I was never
733.16s:  one to read balance sheets. In fact, I was thinking about it today. I was like, when did I start
736.68s:  reading 10 cues or 10 keys, right? And here I am pouring over to get every detail I can from them.
742.60s:  And the company from a balance sheet perspective totally different now. Right? So the Barathees
748.20s:  dollar for dollar makes no sense now. There still are these problems though. They're revenue for
753.80s:  stores falling. They don't have a reason for for for people to be sticky customers right now.
761.56s:  But they're starting to do things like what they've done now. It's very small. It's the
765.64s:  beginnings. But like with the tradable collectible cards like I've got just picked up a new EV by the
771.96s:  way I was hesitating on it if I should show it on the channel. But you know, they're selling PSS.
776.84s:  They're upgraded. What's up? Why is she doing on show it? Oh, here we go. I was like, do people
783.00s:  want to see an EV on the channel? But here we go. Right? So that's my wife's favorite Pokemon.
788.92s:  Pokemon. I got to say Pokemon. I normally say Pokemon joking around with people. But I've realized
793.48s:  that would have been a big misstep here. So anyways, back to EV. So yeah, it's our favorite Pokemon
799.00s:  also. So they're selling these PSA-graded Pokemon cards. They're selling now these candy con
807.80s:  controllers. So we're starting to see like the transformation happen. And the company starts to
813.80s:  branch out in ways it's never done. So I'm excited about that. And then there's also the whole
819.72s:  aspect of you know, Ryan Cohen's on the board. He doesn't take any salary. He doesn't take any
823.80s:  compensation at all. He just buys shares every year. You've got 18% of the company directly registered.
831.80s:  That's never happened before as far as I know. You've got this legacy short interest that's got to be
838.28s:  huge. Honestly. And then we've got Rory and Kitty, right? So we've got the best trader. I think we've
843.64s:  ever seen. I think you can probably agree. Best options trader we've ever come across and now owns
848.04s:  as far as we know, nine million shares of GameStop. I'm waiting for another yellow update.
852.28s:  Right. So the bull thesis is looking pretty good to me. The company's just got to take this legacy
860.68s:  portion of its business, right? Retail gaming, not the most glamorous thing in the universe
865.80s:  and collectibles. And leverage that with the $4 billion in cash it's got. And it's unique fanbase
872.44s:  to do something to make money. So that's basically where the story is now. Is the company at any risk
877.80s:  of going bankrupt? I would say zero, right? So zero risk of bankruptcy lots of cash on hand.
884.04s:  What can they do? And I think that that's what Rory and Kitty spoke to in his in his livestream
889.00s:  just last month, which was stage one is done, right? Curved the cop, the curb, curb the bleeding,
896.36s:  get the legacy business under control. Now we've got a C stage two, which is the transformation.
901.80s:  And that's what I'm waiting for. I'm waiting to see that. We're just seeing like kind of the
904.76s:  beginning parts right now, just experimentation. But I think everyone's looking for a merger or
909.32s:  an acquisition. What could they buy that's going to make the company money? That's number one.
913.24s:  It needs to be small enough to not be a big risk. I don't want to see them burn a ton of cash
918.36s:  and lose a ton of value. But big enough to actually impact the bottom line of the company.
924.12s:  Right. I see. And the pivot's really interesting. I want to linger on that for a moment. But first,
929.16s:  I just want to shout out to everybody in the chat. There's over 600 people here to see you,
934.76s:  Mr. Richard. So thank you for again, taking the time to at least teach me and obviously share
941.64s:  with everybody else. It's super awesome. But let's talk a little bit more about that pivot.
947.64s:  There are a lot of companies blockbuster, Kodak, right, that are examples of companies that
955.24s:  were kind of premier leaders in a field, failed to make a pivot. And then they had a big problem
960.60s:  on a business. So when you look at GameStop and you think about the pivot potential and what kind
970.60s:  of pivot would make sense to questions. First one, timeline. What timeline makes sense for this
976.28s:  two? What does it make sense to pivot into? Well, I hate to just always quote boring kitty,
982.36s:  but he said it really well. It's been three years, right? If this takes more than three years,
987.72s:  that's okay, but if it takes more than five years, that's not okay. So the timeline is,
992.52s:  they need to start doing something here pretty soon. I think people's patience is not endless.
998.92s:  We've got a lot of patience, but not endless. I thought the NFT marketplace was a great idea.
1005.80s:  I know people that followed my channel when it was very small, I was putting out NFTs every week.
1010.20s:  I don't know if you know that. So I was doing my own drawings, publishing NFTs using loop ring,
1015.56s:  and then giving those away to people. I thought NFTs made a ton of sense for two reasons. Number one,
1021.24s:  it was a way to take digital assets like in video games and make them collectible and then transferable
1026.44s:  between gaming ecosystems. So people could retain their value outside of say servers being shut down.
1033.16s:  So like, let's say you earned an item in Diablo Immortals, right? And then that server shuts down,
1039.32s:  and someone makes a private server where all those assets are still real, right? And you can still use
1043.00s:  them. And NFTs for items or NFTs for games are right up GameStop's alley because it's all about
1048.76s:  buying and reselling games. At the heart of it, that's been GameStop's kind of like MO or like
1053.40s:  identity for 20 years. So if GameStop became like the place to go for buying and reselling games that
1060.44s:  were in NFT form or in GameAsets that were in NFT form, that would have been like the perfect way
1067.40s:  to take GameStop's existing legacy identity and make it modern, right? And capitalize on what
1073.88s:  was happening with NFTs. But NFTs went into like a bad period of time, you know? A lot of it became
1079.48s:  very speculative. The kind of market would jump from one chain to another to another. And it became
1086.20s:  honestly just like a rip off Conor's hub, which looked really bad. And the SEC came down with a lot
1092.36s:  of scrutiny on NFTs and crypto in general. And I think that the company kind of like took that
1097.88s:  whole idea, the NFT marketplace and everything associated with it and just put it on hold.
1102.68s:  They were like, it's not the right time. We could get ourselves in a lot of trouble going down this
1107.24s:  rabbit hole. And so they went to things that, you know, are very similar. Like this is very similar
1112.68s:  to me, right? This is something we all know and understand. It is on a blockchain because it's,
1117.48s:  you know, got a QR code and everything associated with it. But someone else holds the key to that,
1122.68s:  PSA does. And it kind of prevents them from going into the whole crypto sphere, but gets them into
1128.76s:  into the collectible space. So I think that's a good way to go. But it's small potatoes right now
1133.00s:  to be honest. Like honestly, PSA graded Pokemon cards is like, I think like a multi-billion dollar
1138.36s:  industry right now. I know that in general, collectible cards are like an $11 billion
1144.20s:  history. How much can games stop pull in of that is yet to be seen. But right now, if you look at
1149.08s:  the volume of cards on the website, pretty small, not going to change the fundamentals of the
1154.28s:  company yet or something like this. So where do they, where do I see them going? But honestly,
1160.76s:  I've said on my channel, they probably want to go in a direction that no one would expect
1165.00s:  to give them some kind of, I don't know, survivability started to talk so long on this. It's a good
1169.24s:  question. Survivability in the long term. And like, so with the amount of money they have,
1175.16s:  $4 billion, they could just become a holding company. They could have another company under their
1180.04s:  umbrella that has nothing to do with gaming, nothing to do with the collectibles that just makes money.
1186.36s:  I would be happy with that too. IEP and Berkshire Hathaway are great examples. Very diverse
1192.92s:  holding companies. So it could games stop do something like that. They've basically done that in
1196.60s:  the past when they picked up all the mobile division companies. So they could do it again. And they
1201.24s:  built a lot of value there and then sold it off for cash. So I don't know, I'm not beholden to any
1206.12s:  idea. I know people are very focused on esports. I think that's very speculative right now. I think
1211.32s:  it's risky to go into something speculative. I'd like to see them honestly just wait because I think
1215.72s:  that macro conditions are ripe for a downturn and they could buy something for cheap. I don't know
1221.56s:  what it would be. I don't know what Ryan Cohn has in mind. I've said on my channel before. Ryan
1225.24s:  Cohn got into the dog food business. It could be something very unglamorous, like dog food or something.
1231.72s:  And we'd have to take his guidance on it or take his kind of direction on it. I know Larry
1237.96s:  Chang is on the board and he's invested in companies through his venture capital fund like US mobile.
1244.52s:  So very unglamorous. We were talking about budget level phone company, cellular company.
1250.84s:  But if it makes money, it makes money. That's what I'm most interested in.
1254.92s:  The good old, if it makes dollars, it makes sense.
1259.96s:  When I think about the building of capital, I find that entire world pretty interesting because
1266.84s:  they're sitting on a lot of cash. And one of the interesting things right now about the cash
1271.88s:  pile is even at a moderate rate with rates where they're at. It puts them at a pretty healthy spot.
1279.96s:  So when you think about the timeline that they would be looking for in acquisition,
1285.56s:  is there anything that you've picked up from your research that other than potentially waiting for
1290.84s:  a bargain of some sort, something that comes across that looks really good? Do you think that
1294.60s:  there's some sort of imperative that they're fighting against in terms of a timeline to make something
1298.76s:  happen with that cash? Well, I would say I'm super excited for September obviously because we're
1304.60s:  going to see the time that cash is on the balance sheet. So we're going to have a whole new look
1309.08s:  at this company right here in September, probably around the fifth, where we'll see now, like you
1313.96s:  said, about a 5% rate of earn on that cash. That's great. There's going to be paid in on the equity,
1319.56s:  right? So it's not just free cash. People paid into it and it's accounted for on the balance sheet.
1324.44s:  But what I'm looking at is a few things. I'm going to speculate a bit here, which I hate to do too
1329.00s:  much. But there was a merger and acquisition position. Was that? The tinfoil hat dog. I literally
1335.96s:  was going to make a tinfoil hat. Like get you put that motherfucker on and speculate until your
1342.28s:  hearts content. All right. So everyone in the chat is going to know way more than me on this. But I
1346.68s:  know that games stop hired a merger acquisition guy, relatively recently in the last couple months.
1352.20s:  Big signal. Larry Chang has been talking about various things to do with mergers or acquisitions
1360.28s:  or putting capital to use. Specifically, I want to say what he telegraph was you wouldn't dilute
1365.88s:  unless you had a reason to dilute, right? And also that dilutions can be seen as bad. But if they
1371.56s:  increase the long term health of the company, they can be good. And if the time is right,
1375.88s:  then you got to go for it. We also know that the lawsuit that Ryan Cohen, Cohen was brought into
1384.68s:  from the 2022 events was dropped or dismissed back here on June 11th. That's a big deal. So I don't
1392.04s:  know if that lawsuit was holding up a merger and acquisition or holding up the company from doing
1397.48s:  anything. But it's important that they're lawsuit free and the head of the company's lawsuit
1403.48s:  free going into anything that they could do. The other thing I would mention is the last time
1408.20s:  Ryan Cohen bought in was I believe right before the shareholders meeting last year in 2023,
1416.28s:  would have been right here. He had about $10 million with the GameStop in 2022. And then $10
1423.72s:  million with the GameStop in 2023, he hasn't bought any GameStop since. And I think it's a hard
1432.44s:  ask for him to ask his shareholders, hey, I'm going to dilute us 39%, which they just did.
1438.60s:  But then I'm not going to put my own money where my mouth is. I think he's probably
1441.72s:  shopping at the bit to buy shares of the company, something stopping him from buying shares.
1449.40s:  He became CEO shortly after that three months after that. So he's been CEO now for almost a year.
1455.72s:  So I imagine that the CEO is going to be in the know on any kind of merger acquisition that's
1460.52s:  going on with the company. Larry Chang and others might not be so let me that's why they were still
1464.92s:  able to buy. I don't think I have it on the chart still. But somewhere back here, I know Larry
1469.72s:  Chang bought in about $10 or $11. He added to the chart. But Ryan Cohen hasn't. And I know he's
1475.32s:  probably very much wants to. So something stopping him. He's probably on a lockout. And I would just say
1481.40s:  that's basically my gut feeling on merger acquisition news is that we're waiting for to be cleared
1488.44s:  through the powers that be right. So when could it happen? And that's the that's the great unknown
1495.32s:  for me, which makes this, this is the thing I lose sleep the most over is when this announcement happens,
1501.00s:  what's it going to do? Because I know when we talked, you would said generally speaking when a company
1506.84s:  purchases another company, the stock price goes down of the acquireer, right? So the buyer. So
1515.00s:  could it have a negative impact on game stop if game stop goes and purchases some other company?
1519.88s:  Who would they be? How much are they going to contribute? How much is it going to cost us?
1525.00s:  How much are they going to contribute to the bottom line of the company? Those are all things I'm
1527.72s:  interested in. And then what's it going to do to the share price? Right? And what's it going to happen?
1532.76s:  So and it could happen like we've seen with any of this stuff out of nowhere. Like literally it could
1536.76s:  happen. I don't know. Could it happen on a Saturday? Could it happen right now? Probably. So like I just
1542.36s:  always wonder about that. And then correspondingly when is Ryan Cohen going to buy back in?
1547.08s:  Right? So this is a guy that's an independent billionaire. His stake in the company is now and
1553.16s:  down, now and down to 8.6% from 13%. You know, like I said, it doesn't send his shareholders a good
1560.36s:  message when you dilute them 39% and yourself. So he probably wants to buy shares. He's got plenty of
1565.80s:  money with which to do. So how much is he going to buy and when's he going to buy? So those are my two
1570.36s:  most interesting things to look forward to. And there's no timeline on them that could happen at
1574.28s:  any time. So I'm just, you know, waiting on those ones. I see. So a couple follow-ups to that then
1583.32s:  and we have about 45 minutes. I have a hard stop. So just giving everybody a heads up, I actually
1591.72s:  want to make sure that we get it integrated as many questions as we can and whatnot. I don't want
1595.96s:  to linger on any 1.2 long. And if people want rich and I, we were talking about it already and
1601.80s:  potentially doing another one or some sort of cadence if people are interested, but that's a
1606.84s:  that's a future us problem. Focusing on right now, when you look at the share offering,
1615.08s:  obviously there's a ton of conversation about the dilution and a lot of mixed feelings. A lot of
1623.24s:  people felt that they were kind of done dirty, that that crushed any potential of a sneeze,
1630.52s:  which I now know what that is because of you. Thank you. And I think, I think people are really
1638.84s:  wondering how that actors into thing, especially as we get a little closer to transitioning into
1645.56s:  more understanding about your cycle theories. Well, I guess it's kind of a joint cycle. A lot of
1650.04s:  people that stop that. But let's start with the share offering. What do you make of it? Do you
1654.60s:  think that that negatively impacted the potential first sneeze if so? How and how does it feed into
1661.88s:  the FDD theory? Okay, so that's a big question. I think the first thing I would say is that neither of
1667.80s:  these two events we're going to cause more less. I need to start there right away. So more
1673.16s:  asked would be the mother of all short squeezes. We can see that the stock price on right here,
1680.20s:  May 14th in the pre-market hit $80 that morning. That was on a Tuesday morning.
1685.72s:  But it was on its way back down and they didn't offer shares until Friday the 17th. So the stock
1691.56s:  price was already running down. Right. And then Rory and Kitty came in and started supporting the
1697.32s:  offering by buying huge numbers of calls. Right. So two things to consider. They're number one.
1703.96s:  They didn't stop any kind of event. It had already happened. We don't know what it was necessarily.
1708.92s:  But it seems to be like a gamma squeeze of some sort. And then the stock was like pretty obviously
1713.72s:  back under their control. So I would have personally liked them to have issued shares sooner. Like maybe
1722.20s:  Tuesday morning, Wednesday morning. But instead they kind of let that whole cycle play out. And then
1727.08s:  they really offered into the tail end of it five days after big volume appeared. That's when they
1731.88s:  first start selling shares. And it was 50 million shares. They're 45 million shares. That's a lot.
1736.52s:  It's a pretty significant dilution. And they were able to raise $933 million. Which I would say
1742.92s:  is important because I wrote in the letters to the board, which I've got open right here.
1746.92s:  I really didn't want to see them use their cash file for merger and acquisition because you need,
1752.92s:  especially in this environment, high interest rate environment or the cost of borrow.
1757.08s:  It's still high for corporations. You need cash to operate healthily for a company that's trying
1762.44s:  to get their balance sheet under control. So if they are trying to do a merger acquisition or
1766.44s:  something like that, I wanted them to have cash on hand to do it, not use their existing cash file.
1771.72s:  So I'm positive on the whole event right here because they didn't disrupt a cycle. They waited
1777.64s:  for the cycle to kind of end their kind of telegraphing to the community. These cycles are happening.
1782.60s:  Right. If we can raise money into them, like instead of $10 at a low, like some companies do,
1788.12s:  dilute it a low. Let's dilute at a relative recent high. And they even set in the prospectus.
1793.88s:  You know, there's events here that are not corresponding with corporate action.
1797.96s:  So we're going to seize the opportunity and sell shares into it. So I'm sort of okay with this,
1802.76s:  especially because fails to deliver or still appearing post cycle. So you can see XRT still has
1809.64s:  fails to deliver after the cycle. Gamestops tell us large fails to deliver after the cycle. We
1815.72s:  did see 20 million shorts apparently exit their position during this. So report a short interest
1822.60s:  goes down, which you know, if you're looking for a mother of all short squeezes, that's a concern.
1828.36s:  But I don't think if you're looking for a mother of all short squeezes, you're worried about 65
1832.52s:  million shorts going down to 44 million shorts because you're pretty much convinced of this point
1837.00s:  that there's way more shorts out there than are being reported. So this is probably to me a drop
1842.44s:  in the bucket for the overall short interest. So then we get to the second dilution. I like their
1848.52s:  timing way better on this one. I'm going to make a lot of people really angry by saying this though.
1853.40s:  So let me walk through the second dilution. So we had an event happen on June 6th stock ran up to
1859.72s:  $67 in the after hours. And then they immediately offer in the pre-market into it. And they sell even
1865.88s:  more shares this time, 75 million shares at a much better price, $28 a share, raising 2.2 billion or so.
1874.28s:  So much closer to the peak, like basically almost right into the peak. I like this timing. This is
1881.96s:  basically what they did on June 8th, three years ago. So I'm going to go back in time a little bit
1888.28s:  right here. So June 8th is right here. So they had a shareholders meeting. Stock is running up to
1895.00s:  $350. They offer right into the top of it. Netting themselves incredible money right here,
1901.16s:  putting in place all the cash we had on hand to do basically stage one cleaning up the company,
1907.32s:  getting it healthy again and having money on the balance sheet. So they would not have posted a profit
1912.44s:  this past year. Had they not done this? So this was basically a year or three years ago to the day.
1918.60s:  So I like this. I also recommended it to the board in the letter. So I specifically said,
1924.52s:  have shares on hand with which to offer into one of these cyclical events. Because again,
1928.60s:  I don't think this was Moas popping off or any kind of squeeze. I think it's just a fail to
1933.64s:  deliver cycle. So we can kind of maybe pivot into that at this point. The other reason I'm not
1940.44s:  super concerned about it is because they did this as Roryn Kitty was live streaming. And this guy
1947.64s:  at the time was worth what? $900 million on his position. He didn't seem too concerned to me in
1953.56s:  that live stream. I'll be honest or any or surprised at all. And if you go back and look at his
1957.56s:  previous videos where they had offered an S3 in December of 2020, he was actually encouraging them to
1964.04s:  use the S3 raise money because he thought it could be really helpful for their transformation.
1969.96s:  And in this live stream, he basically says, look, you're either thinking that Ryan Cohen is a
1974.36s:  doofus or you think that there's something going on here and what does he do? Cells his calls a
1978.68s:  couple days later and buys a whole bunch of shares. So now this guy is riding a sandworm in his
1984.76s:  meme. And he's got nine million shares of GameStop, as far as we know, hopefully he's still got him.
1990.76s:  I don't doubt he does. That to me is just a huge signal of strength that a company can issue
1999.56s:  50 million shares or 45 million shares. Issue another 75 million shares. And the stock price has
2005.16s:  only gone up in that time period. That's great. So all this is great to me. Company has even more
2012.36s:  cash on hand. They diluted 39%. I don't know. I'm very optimistic about this. And their biggest
2020.04s:  non-board member shareholder. What did he do during the whole time? When from 800,000 shares that
2024.84s:  we knew about up to nine million shares. So I don't know. It's all bullish to me. I'm curious what
2030.12s:  you think. Well, it's funny. The really the highlight of my perspective, you literally just said it.
2036.68s:  So I'll reiterate it though. The fact that especially in this most recent offering, when I saw that
2041.88s:  that was coming out, I was getting ready to closely monitor the price. And it's because I expected
2051.32s:  much more of a reaction that was. So the fact that when they made that offering, it was literally
2058.68s:  eaten up and the market really didn't care to me. That's supremely telling. And the other thing
2066.52s:  that I can't help but find so interesting is what is the intrinsic value right now for games? I
2073.40s:  was like 13 bucks a share or something like that. I think it's 1027. Okay, got it. And when I think
2081.16s:  about where that is juxtaposed to where price currently is, I can only imagine that the people that
2088.68s:  really are trying to short game stop would love nothing more than to press it down here.
2095.00s:  And the fact that it's not happening, I can't help but find that fascinating.
2100.36s:  Especially when we look at the volume in GameStop over the last few weeks, it's been very, very
2107.24s:  on a relative basis, but GameStop has remained exceedingly, exceedingly range bound. It's
2113.88s:  hanging out. What it's hitting lows of like 2223 and then the peak starting from the 18th of June,
2123.08s:  the peak from there has been like 27 maybe. So it's been very, very, very, very range bound
2130.68s:  and light volume and it's not getting pressed down. That's very interesting.
2137.48s:  So when I hear people talking about the impact of the share offering, it has an impact. There's
2143.72s:  no debate about that. That's an objective. But I don't know that the impact is as detrimental as
2150.36s:  people think. Now let's dovetail that though into the FTD conversation because I do think
2157.56s:  that does have an impact there because a lot of people I think sometimes misunderstand
2163.64s:  market makers perspective and I'm not a market maker. I'm actually really close friends with one
2169.24s:  that I asked him about this exact scenario and he did used to work at Susquejana. He runs his own
2175.80s:  little firm now and he's been trading. I literally think for 55 years and he's still market
2183.32s:  so the dude's been at this for a while and I was asking him how he would have treated specifically
2188.92s:  a position like Roy and Kitty's and it was fascinating because for a tenured market maker like
2194.04s:  that his perspective is as you have an option coming closer to expiration that's deeper in the money,
2199.88s:  you hedge it and you would be hedged leading into that event. We know GameStop and the market
2206.12s:  making firms for GameStop it also shocker is a bit of an anomaly and they do have a little bit
2213.48s:  of a history of under hedging in an attempt to make a little bit more money. I would have to
2220.12s:  view though the recent jump in price against the kind of landscape for GameStop with this
2229.96s:  tear offer would probably be well received by people that might be under hedged looking to gain
2236.36s:  exposure. The tricky part for them though is they weren't really getting in at a great price
2242.44s:  because price did not plummet but how does that impact your cycle kind of theory?
2248.92s:  Yeah so I would say that if this is big F right if market makers are juggling fails to deliver
2259.32s:  and they're juggling ETF exposure they also deliver on ETFs then just just a quick offshoot there
2265.96s:  because I think a lot of people actually don't fully understand the juggling thing in the last time
2270.36s:  you were kind enough to like draw it out. Yeah let's draw yeah I think that would be super
2276.20s:  super fun. So basically here's here's kind of my theory in a nutshell so stock price is currently
2282.36s:  at like $24 right and what's going to happen is you're going to see a kind of ebb and flow
2287.56s:  towards Max Payne because as we know the market makers are going to want to end this thing
2291.80s:  near Max Payne so that calls don't get put in the money puts don't get put in the money
2297.80s:  and they could just scalp all the premiums week over week right. So you're going to see a trade
2301.96s:  into these Max Payne windows something like this but true by pressure any retail buy orders
2310.20s:  are not going to affect price positively even something like roaring kiddie's purchase back here
2315.88s:  of 4 million shares right. So all these purchases where are they going to go right they're
2321.24s:  either going to fail game stop so let's put our game stop fails up here. So this is a beautiful
2327.00s:  drawing by the way so here's our game stop. Literally thinking if you do an NFT's these should be
2331.64s:  the freaking NFTs dude. Right so they have two places to juggle they can take these buy orders and
2338.36s:  they can fail game stop right which we see in this column right back here and I'd say what's
2343.48s:  really cool is post offering they were immediately failing game stop to a high degree again which
2350.20s:  is great to see right that was something I was very concerned about are these going to suddenly
2353.88s:  vanish because they're juggling got cleaned up with the offering I don't think so right where
2360.68s:  else do they juggle this well I think when they need more time they can then pivot these fails to
2365.56s:  deliver into ETFs right so down here we've got all these different ETFs I think there's something
2373.00s:  like 105 different ETFs that hold game stop right so what they can do is they can go to a market
2380.12s:  maker and they can say hey make us a unit of XRT which is like 40,000 shares of XRT
2388.92s:  and why would they do that right well upon the creation of this unit of XRT at this batch of XRT
2394.44s:  they're just not going to put any game stop in it they'll put everything else in it
2397.56s:  chewy and all the other companies that are in it but they'll pivot some of these fails to
2401.64s:  deliver from over here it's over here it's a juggling act so what would be the signal that they're
2407.56s:  moving FTDs from one hand to another you would see volume here you would see the creation of ETFs
2413.80s:  and we see that repeatedly in this column here so we can see big creation happening on the ETF here
2420.20s:  and we've been in a drought ever since so that's also encouraging to me because it's showing that
2425.40s:  they're not moving a position around with XRT why would that be encouraging to me I think XRT
2431.24s:  is already sorry I think XRT is already full and someone asked a really good question
2437.00s:  today on my channel they said what do you mean when I say that XRT is full I mean it's all failed
2441.16s:  up so XRT we know has let me pull it up here 230,000 shares of game stop that's represented in
2451.96s:  its outstanding so the most they can fail is 230k shares of game stop but that would be for the
2458.52s:  five million shares of XRT that exist the thing is about ETFs as you can short them to create
2463.88s:  additional like phantom units right and XRT specifically is shorted 400 and something percent so
2471.00s:  that basically means you have to take this whole thing and multiply it by four or five so you're
2475.56s:  gonna have something like 20 million shares or 25 million shares of XRT so basically they can
2481.48s:  fail XRT to about one million shares of GME and then it's done they cannot fail XRT any longer
2489.24s:  it's full up and what is it full of it's full of cash because they're cash settling this ETF
2495.16s:  in hopes of someday down the road turning all that cash back into game stop but they don't want to do
2499.80s:  that yet when are they gonna have to do that and so the signal to me is that post share offering
2505.56s:  you can see right here they were doing a lot of creation of XRT but then they failed
2511.96s:  XRT a whole bunch right during this event right during the offering they're failing XRT like crazy
2517.88s:  still so for some reason they were using like you said all these new shares the 75 million shares
2524.12s:  to do what I think they were hedging options because it's expensive to hedge options you have to go
2529.56s:  to the lend pool they don't want to pay the borrow rate so they said hey we got a good idea this
2533.72s:  roaring kitty guy is holding 120 thousand or 12 million shares worth of options here and we had
2539.48s:  big expertise here lots of options that we're gonna be in the money so let's just hedge a bunch with
2545.08s:  these things right these brand new shares and let's not fix RT right away so when are they gonna
2550.68s:  fix XRT is basically the question when are they going to instead of having an ETF full of cash instead
2557.64s:  of shares a game stop well they could pass it back over and fail game stop a whole bunch we've
2563.96s:  seen that happen in the past or they could go to the market and buy game stop but if they do that what's
2570.20s:  gonna happen to the price it's gonna go up really really high right so this is where we see events
2576.36s:  like 6.6 I believe 6.6 was them settling ETFs especially XRT getting shares back in there to
2584.44s:  basically clean it up so it can be their liquidity engine again and they can use it to drive
2588.68s:  price down so June would have been one of those events and then when would the next one be right
2593.48s:  is the big question I think everyone would want to know when is the next time they need to fix XRT
2601.88s:  got it now this leads to two follow on questions the first one that I saw that was really good is
2610.04s:  why do you think there was such a low in these cycle activities that have now since
2617.40s:  popped back up right there great great question so I think there's basically the following
2622.52s:  ways to short the stock right they can go to the lent pool so how do you short a stop
2630.84s:  and actually type for once I know it makes people mad to start
2634.28s:  I actually thought that we were gonna get a bit more creative drawing but okay fine
2639.24s:  all right so way number one you can short the stock is you could just go to the lent pool they never
2643.64s:  want to go to the lent pool right it's reportable they're paying you know a short percent
2652.28s:  every single day they don't want to do that so they could buy a putt's right
2657.56s:  when they buy a put a market maker is going to come in and hedge it what's the market maker
2661.40s:  going to do to hedge the putt short sell the stock right probably naked so they could drive
2666.44s:  the stock down that way and it inflates the off-standing because the market maker is naked shorting
2671.88s:  to hedge their position or they could fail to deliver an ETF right which is what I just described
2678.92s:  right here this basically gives them not infinite liquidity but near infinite just like we saw
2687.24s:  go ahead just a quick note on the the hedging puts the way that you're talking about hedging
2693.64s:  that is what we would call like a bit of a pure hedge there's a lot of other ways that they can
2699.00s:  hedge that position now and I think it's important just to flag that again it doesn't impact this
2704.12s:  too much I do see a lot of people apply the very strict approach of hedging with pure hedges
2711.00s:  and the reason why I bring that up is because it oversimplifies a little bit about the the way
2716.52s:  that market makers are going to manage their book and it's never predicated on one single position
2722.28s:  it's always predicated on the entire book of positions across all products right just a worthwhile
2728.44s:  note nothing incorrect at all but just something other people should be aware of perfect and then
2735.00s:  I'll say the last one the most the one we know the least about is right swaps so what is a swap
2741.24s:  you know a swap is a derivative contract between a party and a counter party if it's an equity
2746.20s:  total return swap and it's to the downside you're betting that the stock is going to go down
2750.20s:  right so you could get huge exposure to game stock to the downside um what's the counter party
2756.68s:  going to do they're going to hedge that position they're going to you know go short with you
2761.40s:  because they want to make they don't want to make the difference on the trade they want to make
2764.36s:  the the premiums on the trade so they want to make the interest that you're paying them
2769.80s:  so to enter a swap you're going to have to find a counter party willing to bet with you that
2774.52s:  game stop is going to go down that is just interested in scalping your premium along the way
2779.64s:  and can make it shorted for you along the way so what do I think happened to basically stop these
2785.64s:  cycles from happening because we didn't see a cycle like this I'll go to the chart here for a second
2790.12s:  in a long time so let me go let me go to cycles here yeah while you're doing that a quick note for
2798.12s:  uh GC they're just asking what a swap is um the the way to think about a swap is it's kind of like
2805.80s:  a derivative that's created between two parties and it's a non-standard derivative there's different
2812.04s:  rules and underlines that and be part of a swap so just for you to be aware of just think of it
2820.20s:  as a contract between two people with specific terms perfect so here's game stop graph and what
2828.68s:  I'm going to show is these peaks that we were seeing back in 2021 most of these high points back
2833.72s:  here were probably ETF related cycles happening but we haven't seen very many of them since we saw
2839.80s:  one back here we saw one here and then this was the last one we really saw this was in um June of
2847.08s:  2023 it was it was like a small one if it was even even a cycle then we saw nothing since and I
2853.24s:  think the reason why we didn't see anything since is because we know that a lot of swaps containing
2858.60s:  game stop were entered back here in August to 2022 the only cycles after these swaps were entered
2865.00s:  was the one I mentioned on Halloween of 2022 potentially like a small one in February of 2023
2874.60s:  and a small cycle that happened in June of 2023 right after Ryan Cohen bought in price
2881.08s:  ran up a bit made some fails they look pretty distinctive so how are they controlling this I think
2886.44s:  they were controlling this with long duration swaps and we know that all the swaps all their
2891.64s:  expiry for all those different swaps that were in it was at the end of May of this year so the timing
2898.20s:  is just too perfect so we know that there's just a couple ways you can short we've got the one with
2903.80s:  the most visibility but it's also pretty good visibility ETFs don't have a lot of visibility but
2909.24s:  the cycles seem pretty distinctive and swaps are a long duration and huge talking about tens of
2914.36s:  millions of shares but we do know that they were expiring at the end of May and beginning of June
2919.48s:  and that's when everything started happening again on game stop so to me it's a question of where did
2926.92s:  all the cycles go they were able to just say okay our ETFs are full we don't want this thing to
2933.72s:  blow up again had these cycles appear again so we're willing to pay a counter party a lot of premium
2939.08s:  it's going to cause us to bleed out over months and months and months just like in the big short
2943.00s:  as you're paying out those premiums and then they had to re-enter but upon re-entering those swaps
2948.04s:  either they didn't re-enter or the exposure or the naked exposure caused the cycles to flare up
2954.20s:  because they needed to they need to have the short position the juggling needs to be somewhere
2959.96s:  it's either going to be an FTDs on game stop which they don't want to see it's going to be on fails
2964.52s:  to deliver on ETFs or ETFs go on rake show which they don't want to see or they got to keep paying
2970.04s:  premiums on swaps which they don't want to do but once this expires you're going to see everything
2974.44s:  else flare up again yeah i'm following i think that makes it a pretty sound case now
2983.80s:  when you think about like takes off the activity right you've kind of outlined that pretty clearly
2991.80s:  what kills the activity what forces us to kind of go into these really quiet dormant
2998.36s:  and it's the swaps count out it's a swaps got it right and you can or i'll actually
3005.08s:  mention one other thing i wanted to make sure i mentioned they basically need to find sellers
3010.76s:  right so a swap to me just represents a big bunch of sellers when they enter them right back here
3018.12s:  in august of 2022 the stock got crushed down because their counter party is going to sell
3024.04s:  they're going to sell shares in this case that they don't own right they're naked short on the
3028.36s:  to hedge the swap right so the stock goes down because of all the selling pressure
3033.24s:  when they re-entered swaps somewhere around in here what happens stock goes down even more right
3039.72s:  so entering swaps is one way to cause suppression of cycles suppression of price
3044.76s:  but another way is institutional ownership that went down so we can see
3049.40s:  game stop institutional ownership used to be like 99 percent
3054.28s:  but then institutions sold off throughout 2021 so back in here so every time institutions sold out
3062.68s:  especially post-November the stock i hit hard because retail doesn't have that kind of buying
3068.04s:  capacity i know retail did buy like 75 million shares in drs and all and probably owns like
3073.40s:  you know 300 million shares overall but it takes a long time for retail to buy if an institution
3078.60s:  just goes out and dumps 10 million shares that's very hard for retail to go and undo right it takes
3084.44s:  months and months and months and that's why you see the steady like creep back up i think
3088.92s:  but i think that what we saw was big institutional selling but to me a big bullish thing is that
3093.72s:  institutions are now basically done like they've unloaded all their bags if institutions want to
3098.84s:  get back in on game stop they've got a long way to go so this is like a contested space at this point
3104.28s:  an institutional ownership is at a low i see um let's pivot a little bit more now to the to the cycles
3114.68s:  we see a couple really big tendencies in terms of seasonality you're walking me through that in your
3122.28s:  tracker quite a bit now this month tends to be quiet next month ends to have some kind of activity
3130.44s:  what are your expectations around that and can you also talk a little bit about how you're counting
3136.28s:  the cycles specifically the t35 okay so let's talk about you know and i want to stay right away i
3142.28s:  didn't come up with these cycles um so i don't want to take any credit for them i'm just trying to
3146.44s:  explain what other people have discovered and it seems right on the money because you can go back to
3151.00s:  like as an example um i don't know i'll just find a cycle it's pretty distinctive this one looks
3158.20s:  pretty good um the volume's not crazy high but you can see we were in a drought of volume here
3163.32s:  this is February 6th it's always at the beginning of a month and there's a reason for that you can
3169.32s:  see that the price flips up here this is a relative high on price 25 dollars you know decent volume
3175.48s:  everyone will remember these like there's key days in the game stop histories like in the lore right
3180.92s:  when these happen price is going bonkers just like on June 6th and then crashes right off the top
3187.64s:  and gets shorted down into oblivion so what happened here i believe if you look back you're
3193.16s:  probably looking at yeah or signals right there so this is February so what you want to do is you
3198.68s:  want to go back to not the previous op-ex but the one ripe up for it so we're looking at December's
3205.24s:  op-ex and what we're looking for is a signal here and the signal we're specifically looking for
3210.04s:  is fails to deliver on xrt other ETFs are probably good too but it has to do specifically not with
3216.36s:  the game stop fails which there's good ones here to see but it's the fails to deliver on the ETFs
3221.00s:  that's what we're looking for so what's happened here is what i believe happens is this is a monthly
3226.76s:  options expiry especially yearly like this this is December right so lots of activity there's going
3231.88s:  to be lots of puts and calls going on here they don't want to go and get game stop shares although
3236.12s:  it looks like they had to to satisfy this and they failed a bunch of them but they do is they go to
3241.00s:  ETFs and fail the ETFs instead so that's what i described on the picture here so during a monthly
3246.52s:  options expiry a period like this lots of demand for game stop they don't want the price to run up
3251.48s:  so they do the juggling act and they go to the ETFs right so what do we see we see volume and fails
3257.80s:  to deliver on the ETFs going here's a little bit of high volume here on the ETFs and then they're
3263.80s:  going to have to reconcile this creation of shares that will have game stop in them some time later so
3270.60s:  i don't know why it works this way i want to say this right away i understand that it should be
3275.64s:  35 calendar days but it's 34 trading days so if you just go out 34 trading days
3283.40s:  it's usually 33 or 34 like right on the nose and that's where the cycle happens in theory
3288.92s:  why does this work hopefully people follow along with me here i think that it's because it's not one
3294.44s:  market participant that's happened here it's two market participants what happens is they
3300.60s:  request the creation of the share of the ETF now that ETF authorized participant that's the first
3306.36s:  that makes the ETFs the units has 35 calendar days so that's going to take us out to five weeks from
3314.12s:  which is going to be so this would be actual calendar based and you would go out to about right here
3320.68s:  but then there's like six trading days that you tack onto it and then a couple more trading days
3325.80s:  because of settlement and you end up here so this is sort of hard to say on a live stream but i do
3332.84s:  understand that the rules should be 35 calendar days but it doesn't appear to work that way at all
3338.36s:  it's always 33 to 34 trading days and it hits it right on the nose every single time so
3344.76s:  let's go to the one that would be the most interesting the one that roaring kiddie seemed to
3349.08s:  anticipate and kicked off everything we've just seen so what we can see is huge fails to deliver
3355.00s:  over the last year on xrt and all the other ETFs and games dot importantly so they were
3362.60s:  suppressed in the stock as hard as they possibly could got it down all the way to 10 bucks
3366.76s:  you can see that the fails are going crazy on xrt at this point they're not even following a pattern
3371.08s:  they're just happening all over the place but where you would expect one of these like reconstitution
3378.44s:  of ETF cycles to occur is right here on May 3rd because that's from options x free and march
3384.76s:  34 trading days later exactly so we go out 34 trading days and again i know it shouldn't work
3390.20s:  like this but it seems to and all of a sudden you see huge volume out of nowhere
3396.44s:  and the price goes up like crazy this is a classic may cycle what did roaring kiddie do he bought
3402.76s:  calls as we all know right in this cycle millions of dollars with the calls and they were so cheap
3408.28s:  right there it's crazy the calls were incredibly cheap to buy so that caused a gamma induced event
3415.00s:  leading all the way up to 80 dollars a week and a half later all right so that's like a lot that's
3420.76s:  a lot to process i think anyone new to the story is going to be like what just happened here but it's
3426.20s:  crazy because you can go back years and years and years and you can find these cycles like here's one
3432.44s:  now quick note on that though what do you think about the instances where the cycle doesn't happen
3438.28s:  that's a good question um so yeah so right here classic case big volume big price improvement
3444.20s:  cycles clearly coming off of this opx where we see huge fails to deliver perfect case right and
3449.00s:  this is just some random month in 2014 but it it won't happen right and it should like in July
3455.96s:  July is a really good case let's go to a July options expert where we see big fails to deliver on
3462.68s:  well here's look at the fails to deliver here on this July options expert right on game stop
3468.36s:  4.2 million shares failed but no cycle or sorry it would be um i misspoke you would need to look at
3478.44s:  may options expert to see a July cycle and we almost never see a July cycle so like right here no
3484.76s:  cycle right why why don't they ever happen so let's go to um let me go to 2021 so we had a cycle
3496.12s:  basically every single month in 2021 except for July and why not so like you can go back here's
3503.88s:  34 trading days or so after actually a couple days later after right here we have look at the
3511.48s:  fails to deliver on xrt right this is a pretty classic signal these are may options expert here's
3517.00s:  big fails on xrt you should be able to count 33 trading days later and see big volume and price
3523.08s:  improvement but you don't instead you see you know relatively low volume especially for 2021
3530.20s:  and price is just getting hammered down off its recent my top of 56 here down into like the 40 range
3536.68s:  so why why no cycle on July and so what I did was I put a sheet here together where I looked back
3544.68s:  and I said you know sorry quick interruption there's a question on when does the cycle start so
3552.36s:  what is the actual yeah like we should probably look at the most recent one so look at um may third
3560.12s:  that's a good question what you might see sometimes is something like sorry
3566.04s:  scrolling all over the place here so see how the day before somebody is epilepsy
3572.76s:  right see how the day before on May 2nd there was actually like a blip up in volume
3579.64s:  that could have been because he was buying all these calls right but so maybe there's options
3587.64s:  related activity leading up to it but it's typically a corrupt just boom we're all used to this
3594.04s:  huge volume pours in on a nowhere and this is not like what we saw with um a DRS buy that comes
3599.96s:  in like every two weeks off computer share or a small little blip and it fails to deliver this is huge
3605.96s:  right but it's not opx I just someone just said in the comments it starts on an opx no
3610.92s:  it it's off of I call it a tailwind because it's related to this march opx that happened two months
3615.80s:  before or 34 training days before but it's characteristic of being in the first part of the month
3622.60s:  opx is the third Friday of the month right so this is early in the month and is somehow related to
3628.44s:  the events from the past so good question I went back and tracked them all so our data basically
3635.32s:  starts with one of these events in 2012 and there was a June cycle on June 7th that year and you
3641.48s:  can see that June hits consistently like basically all the time so 66% of our June's we've seen a
3649.24s:  cycle happen to one degree and other yellows like a like a maybe not a full cycle maybe just like
3655.32s:  has some volume or has some price improvement but not full and same thing with August
3660.28s:  but like July almost never happens for some reason and December almost never happens
3666.76s:  yeah and from a data perspective some of that becomes anomalous to me like why it would be
3673.64s:  those seasonal and there's a lot of intricate market forces that can of
3680.44s:  go into the the background behind that but we have we have about 10 minutes left
3686.68s:  one of the next things I think we have to hit quickly at least is XRT and specifically
3696.68s:  what do you think about XRT's involvement you talked about the ETFs a bit already
3702.92s:  but there was a couple questions specifically about XRT so is there anything special there as far
3708.68s:  as you see it yeah I think XRT has been a big part of the story since really the beginning as far
3717.24s:  as my data goes back here you can see that during options related settlement on GameStop XRT was
3723.08s:  hit up every single time like here's an off-excelement period this is July of 12 years ago the volume
3729.72s:  on XRT is crazy and the fails to deliver on XRT correspondingly crazy so they've been using XRT
3735.72s:  as a source for a locate for shares for GameStop for decades right for a very very long time but what's
3742.20s:  important is you know there's a there's other companies in GameStop like Chewy and just recently
3749.08s:  Chewy became GameStop or XRT's number one holding and Warren Kitty just bought some large number
3757.40s:  of shares that GameStop confound about 13G right so at the same period of time this is very odd
3762.76s:  the GameStop went from one of the biggest holdings of XRT to now only being 1.1% of XRT
3769.24s:  and Chewy became the biggest holding of XRT now Warren Kitty's going after Chewy so what's
3776.52s:  the relationship there and what is Warren Kitty's seeing that I'm not seeing someone posted something
3780.84s:  on SuperStunk today that's great which is that of all the stocks in XRT there's a whole bunch in
3787.72s:  there right there's only three that don't have near 100% institutional ownership so let me pull
3795.80s:  that up really quick should be you know the top of SuperStunk hopefully it's up here
3810.04s:  I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to find it right away I know it's going to be right below where
3814.52s:  I stopped scrolling but basically mine always that goes right yeah so it's interesting that
3821.40s:  of all these stocks held in this in this very very overshorted ETF right institutions own like
3829.40s:  a hundred percent of almost all those ones in that basket and GameStop used to be owned a
3835.00s:  hundred percent ninety-nine percent by institutions because it was so overshorted right so it's telling
3839.40s:  me that all the stocks in XRT are very overshorted that's the only way that institutions creep up to
3845.72s:  a hundred percent ownership right because every time they lend their shares then they buy the back
3849.24s:  of same shares and they keep increasing their holdings as the share price plummets right so this
3855.40s:  basket of stocks XRT is unique because number one it's been moving between like 400 percent short
3862.04s:  and a thousand percent short over all the time we've been watching it all the underlying are
3867.80s:  probably grossly shorted if they have a hundred percent institutional ownership except for
3872.44s:  basically three companies GameStop, Chewy and this recent company that just got added to it I'm not
3877.24s:  sure even on the name so somehow roaring kiddies targeting the two companies in it that aren't
3883.40s:  like institutionally owned a hundred percent and why is he doing that so it's just a huge curiosity
3889.16s:  but the only times that we've seen XRT volume like we saw in the recent last six weeks like we saw
3895.40s:  30 million keep in mind there's only supposed to be five million shares outstanding of XRT
3900.28s:  but we're seeing 30 million volume on it right here right so something's going on with it the only
3904.20s:  time we've seen anything even close to that was during the sneeze so they immediately went to
3912.28s:  where is it? way off here then immediately went to XRT right here for 30 million shares back to
3923.40s:  back days and XRT you can see on the side here immediately went on reg show so for an ETF to go on
3930.44s:  reg show is a sign that like something's dangerously wrong and we can see that the sneeze took
3935.40s:  them to like that dangerous own right away they immediately said we need to fail it into oblivion
3940.52s:  get all these games stock fails off of our you know right hand and into our left hand
3947.96s:  that's what everyone noticed right away there was like a thousand percent short interest on XRT
3952.76s:  and there was a period of quiet right fails to deliver go away volume's still pretty big
3959.16s:  but stock price was really really low they crushed it down but then what happens
3963.48s:  all the fails start popping up again right and it's just been a juggling act to me ever since
3968.28s:  and occasionally what's interesting is they'll fail other ETFs so maybe they'll bounce it to XRT
3974.68s:  for a while but at some point they'll have to go to another ETF like I'm not sure what this was
3979.48s:  specifically but I've got a bunch of other ETFs tracking back here so it could be VTI which you're
3986.28s:  probably familiar with or VT or IWB but at some point they juggle away from game stop because their
3994.12s:  fails are getting too bad on game stop away from XRT because their fails are getting too bad on XRT
3999.56s:  and they go to another ETF and so you see the signal move to another ETF but this seems to be the ETF
4005.40s:  of like favor for them and I'm not sure why that would be maybe state street just doesn't regulate
4012.20s:  it as tightly as the other ones or maybe the lend fee is more reasonable there but it seems to be
4017.96s:  the one they always go to the most they do occasionally go to other sources like they did right here
4024.20s:  got it let's talk about the future you and I when we were talking last you had some kind of
4034.04s:  specific thoughts about August and also shout out to Crypteto who just donated to the stream so
4042.68s:  that's super awesome thank you very much for that but looking out to August what's happened
4051.80s:  yeah so basically if we look at what happened recently we saw on 5.3 this would have been an ETF
4059.56s:  related settlement event right again I didn't discover these or anything like this it would have
4064.52s:  been off March topics so 3 17 or whatever what for what it was leads to this event here we saw the
4072.84s:  price run up but DFV anticipated it bought calls into it and basically rather than the stock price
4078.84s:  crashing back down to $10 like we would have expected it to it got caught in gamma and then ran
4085.56s:  off to $100 or $80 up something like that right so there was a share offering into the tail end of
4093.64s:  it right here so a question that you had earlier was am I concerned about the share offerings
4100.84s:  not really because if the share offering would have like killed cycles then 6 6 wouldn't have
4106.36s:  happened but it happened anyway right so we saw another big ETF related settlement event of
4111.96s:  event again and what this is is they have filled up XRT with cash and other ETFs with cash they
4118.92s:  desperately need shares a game stop they don't want to fail game stop a whole bunch so they go to
4122.84s:  the lit market they buy shares on that Thursday and then so it runs up and then Friday they want
4128.84s:  to crush it back down in Max Payne because again they need to get the shares into the ETF but they
4133.48s:  need to get it through the Max Payne window right so the company offers just a quick note on that
4139.88s:  because you mentioned that before too and I just want to clarify a little bit about Max Payne I have
4144.76s:  a video that goes pretty deep into detail on it but it's important to note that market makers they
4149.96s:  actually don't have the leeway to just move price wherever they want to get it to Max Payne
4155.56s:  market makers are really slaved to order flow so I do believe that they have an incentive if price
4163.16s:  is close to Max Payne to try to drift it there but if price is like a wide margin away
4171.40s:  they can't just move price it's just important for people to be aware of how Max Payne kind of
4177.96s:  affects the marketplace because it's a thing to be aware of if it's close absolutely on the table
4183.24s:  if price something like this if it's trading for 15 20 dollars if it's like 5% away they can't move
4190.44s:  price 5% so just an important note I think maybe games stop people my disagree because we've
4196.92s:  just seen so many days where these cycles hit on a Thursday and by Friday sure enough here we are
4202.44s:  right in Max Payne again right yeah what's interesting is this cycle just a quick follow on to that
4208.60s:  though one of the things that you have to track is where Max Payne is so one of the reasons why
4214.60s:  you'll see that tendency is because people are trading their option into expiration they're
4220.92s:  trying to salvage what value they can out of their slightly out of the money option so that moves
4227.40s:  where Max Payne definitely in I try to like on the sheet you'll notice like I put Max Payne over here
4234.20s:  and when I start to see it move a bunch like okay the flow is pretty interesting because the flow is
4238.68s:  going to move the Max Payne around a bunch right yeah let's totally sure so maybe something to
4246.36s:  mention before we get into the future is looking again at the past the cycles rarely end on a Friday
4251.16s:  because of the nature of the options X-Brief is going to be on a Friday and if you go T plus 6 T plus
4258.12s:  35 T plus one or two or whatever it almost never ends on a Friday again but it did in this may cycle
4264.52s:  so very very important this may cycle for one of the first times in a long time may third right here
4271.96s:  was Friday so price ran up all the way up to 1745 they were only able to get it down a dollar
4278.20s:  by end of day so that caused you know it ended way over Max Payne for the first time in a long
4283.80s:  long time and you can see what happened like the impact of that was just incredible so we can see
4289.16s:  why they don't want it to go too far above or below Max Payne because apparently in the weaker
4293.80s:  two to follow it's just going to cause a reckoning so that's what we saw in May 3rd reckoning happened
4299.80s:  went up to $80 company issues we still get a cycle off of ETFs I think there's some kind of deferral
4308.04s:  because of June 10th so June 10th to 6th 19 and then 4th of July is another holiday both of these
4316.04s:  holidays landed in the middle of the week this year not on a Monday or Friday and I think for
4322.12s:  some reason when the holidays land in the middle of the week it means that they don't have a reconstitution
4328.04s:  event so we're not going to see I don't think a tailwind on 7.9 like we should so there should be a
4334.76s:  cycle here on 7.9 but instead it's going to skip because the holiday basically pushes it to the next
4343.16s:  one which is going to be $80 so that's my my current theory is you know was able to predict this
4352.04s:  one with pretty pretty strong confidence because I had looked at the chart we'd had 66% of June's hit
4359.48s:  July almost never hits whereas August is pretty consistent I love it and I am at my hard stop
4369.08s:  so I have to drop and that will wrap us up but first I got to say thank you so much again for the
