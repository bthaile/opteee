0.00s: GME options chain is showing some signs of life,
3.76s: but not in the way that I was expecting to see.
6.64s: So what happened today?
7.80s: Well, it was down a little bit about 2.2%.
11.48s: We are not making the movement I was hoping to see,
14.60s: which is a little bit more of a continuation
16.56s: to the upside here.
17.40s: It looks like we are starting to sell off more
22.00s: into this value area, which I was hopeful
25.16s: that we might start taking back up above this point
27.72s: of control people transacting in.
30.04s: And if we take a look at the volume today,
31.92s: it's still quite anemic, but the overwhelming majority
36.76s: has sell volume 93%.
40.36s: So there's a couple of things going on here.
42.96s: The main thing I'm seeing from a volume perspective,
45.24s: though, is just less activity in GameStop.
48.84s: Now, what I thought was interesting today
51.44s: was what was going on in the options chain.
54.08s: So if we take a peek over here, a couple of things jump out
57.88s: of me, the first one.
59.28s: Take a look at the open interest.
60.72s: It's changed massively now.
63.24s: It's already at 604,000 calls to 360,000 puts.
69.28s: So we are approximating much closer to at least
72.48s: the two to one ratio that I tend to see
75.24s: before these things start getting really active
77.48s: specifically to the upside.
79.40s: Now, the other thing I noticed right from the jump
82.24s: is a pretty healthy split in explorations
87.28s: for the calls and the puts.
89.24s: Here's what I mean by that.
90.72s: If you take a look at these calls,
92.32s: you'll notice that the larger contracts are in 16og.
97.12s: Right?
97.96s: That's what these boxes that are higher up on this list
102.12s: indicate a higher open interest.
104.92s: So we can see that the 125s are really heavy.
107.16s: We can see that these 30s are heavy and so on and so forth.
110.60s: The majority of the heavier calls are out here in 16og
114.60s: as indicated by there being the same color box.
117.48s: They really make this stuff pretty much
120.52s: idiot proofer.
121.28s: People like me that like shapes and colors
123.60s: and they do a great job making it pretty easy
126.04s: to see what's going on here.
127.00s: But then if you take a look over here,
129.64s: it's a completely different story, isn't it?
132.08s: When I look at the open interest,
133.68s: I see a massive block up here, 17 Jan 2025,
138.84s: the 10 puts, 16,810 of those.
142.92s: Then I see a bunch of stuff out here in 16og.
146.64s: Then I see another one here out in 18og 24,
152.12s: back to 17 Jan 25.
155.24s: So what I'm highlighting is that there's quite a bit
158.64s: of activity on the put side that spans
162.28s: a bunch of different explorations.
164.12s: We don't necessarily see the same level of disparity
169.32s: between expiration cycles on the call side.
171.60s: Interesting.
173.52s: Next, volume for today.
177.28s: This stuck out like a sore thumb on the put side.
181.12s: On the put side up here, I can see for nineog 24,
186.20s: the 22s, there was 5,000 of those that traded.
190.80s: That immediately is something I'm interested in.
194.24s: I also see a pretty healthy block
196.08s: for this coming expiration cycle,
197.64s: which is pretty standard fair for what I tend to see
200.88s: in GameStop where the front expiration
202.68s: tends to be pretty busy.
204.00s: So nothing really sticking out there to me.
207.00s: Same thing with this, the 16og 24,
210.20s: I fully anticipate to see more and more activity,
213.64s: essentially in this front expiration cycle,
215.44s: the twoog and then the 16og.
217.44s: That all about what I expect to see.
221.20s: Now as I start looking in at kind of the distribution
225.64s: within this dense area,
228.36s: and I can get a sense of what's transacting
231.40s: where how busy these different expiration cycles are,
234.32s: but then you start going out here,
236.44s: and you notice an interesting trend.
239.00s: I see the one tens, the one 15s,
243.52s: the 120s and the 125s being relatively busy
247.44s: out here in 16 Jan 26.
250.32s: Now I also notice it a little bit on the call side though.
254.48s: So this can be setting up smaller trades,
257.28s: looking at things like spreads between the call
262.28s: on the put side, it could be.
264.04s: We don't know yet, we have to take a look.
266.16s: So then what I like to do is say, okay,
268.64s: first thing I want to take a look at is these nineog 22s
271.96s: because that's a lot on the put side.
275.12s: And then on the call side,
276.20s: this does not surprise me to see the twoogs
278.60s: getting really, really active.
281.20s: This is essentially what I anticipated seeing.
283.80s: We're seeing build out of all of these closer
286.44s: to the money strikes, which is kind of what we've talked about
290.20s: before.
291.76s: No surprise coming in here.
294.52s: Now as I mentioned though, on the put side,
297.64s: this is kind of interesting to me.
299.84s: This position built out nineog at the 22s.
303.00s: So if we pop over there nineog at the 22s,
306.16s: we can see this is interesting.
309.16s: And it's interesting because the open interest existing
312.12s: was 363, except the volume today was five,
316.40s: 1,000.
317.68s: That's a really great alert.
320.40s: That something is going on.
322.16s: Don't really know what yet takes a little more digging
324.48s: to find out.
325.76s: But when you see instances where the current open interest
329.96s: is so low and the volume is so high,
333.84s: somebody's interested in this at this level
336.16s: for a very specific reason.
338.68s: There's only 11 days out and we definitely want to see
342.44s: what this transaction was,
344.00s: whether we bought or sold on those.
346.68s: So we can come in here into time and sales
349.80s: and they're right there.
352.24s: So you can see there's 526 of them at the nineog 22 puts.
357.48s: And these came in at 30, so these were bought.
361.56s: Now we can get even more specific by grabbing just the put side.
366.12s: We can go specifically to that nineog series.
368.44s: We can go specifically to the 22s,
371.48s: where that activity was and see how active this series was
376.48s: and take a look.
378.60s: Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, baby.
381.56s: That's essentially what there's people just piling
383.92s: on long puts.
384.96s: That's what this is, massive amount of long puts
387.32s: being piled on.
388.88s: And these all flow through pretty similar time.
392.28s: Notice that 0, 8, 36, 31 seconds, all of them dumped out.
398.16s: Some of them went to AMAC, some of them routed best,
400.68s: some C2s, just all over the place.
402.84s: All these different exchanges routing.
404.92s: So there's a pretty sizable position being built out via
409.04s: long puts in the nineog that's of interest to me.
412.88s: That's a bearish position.
414.76s: I want to keep an eye on that.
417.36s: I don't have a great sense of what it is yet,
419.44s: other than potentially just following this near term trend
423.36s: that we're seeing to the downside.
425.68s: Now the other thing that I noticed as I told you before,
429.40s: if we go back to OI, that there's a lot of this volume
432.96s: build out way out and far in time, 16 Jan 26, the 125s.
437.64s: I see the 120s active.
438.92s: I see the 115s active.
440.68s: These tail style puts are interesting to me.
443.08s: You can also see them happening over here.
445.08s: Super far out in time, super far out of the money, 125s.
450.28s: So there's been a lot of activity there.
451.60s: So we can also hone in on that for this one,
454.16s: I'll use unusual whales because it's a little easier to see.
457.72s: Here's the takeaway from my perspective on this at least.
461.72s: I see a giant mix of bids coming in, pretty small sizes,
468.28s: 15, 10s, a lot of tens, and they're hitting the 115s,
473.20s: the 125s and the 120s.
476.08s: So these traits aren't necessarily massive,
479.36s: but there's a lot of repeat positions.
482.28s: And you can see that again, like I for GameStop,
485.16s: I've calibrated my initial interest in premium
488.08s: to be about six figures.
489.40s: That's where I start to get pretty curious.
492.20s: And then when I see repeat hits like this,
494.64s: I'm also curious, I wanna keep an eye on these.
497.52s: Now these are still relatively small.
500.04s: And the other thing that you can see is that there are some
502.96s: asks at the same sizes and the same strikes.
506.48s: So some of these can almost be calendarized
509.60s: because you can see, for example, here,
512.24s: these 120s are in 2025.
516.68s: And then you can see 120s here,
518.80s: same expiration cycle, same strike,
521.76s: essentially same time, right, 093859 versus 57.
526.88s: That starts to look like a spread that was liked into to me.
530.16s: So some of this looks like a spread being built.
532.96s: Some of this doesn't look like that,
534.28s: but there are instances like this again here.
536.36s: This looks like a spread being built.
538.88s: This came in at 101018, 101019.
541.60s: This was at the bid, this one's at the offer, 115,
544.08s: same expiration cycle.
545.80s: So there's a lot of different activities going on here,
548.84s: but the most interesting thing I'm finding right now
551.16s: is all of the busyness out in 2025, 2026.
555.08s: We have not seen this activity out that far to this degree.
558.92s: Since essentially I started looking at this more closely in May.
563.92s: So this is something I wanna keep an eye on.
565.24s: Now what's the takeaway from this?
566.88s: For me, in the way that I synthesize information
569.80s: is too early to tell.
571.16s: More over than that, these are so far out in time.
574.24s: I don't wanna say it doesn't matter,
575.52s: but it kinda doesn't matter yet.
577.32s: That's really part of what I see here.
580.00s: Now what I can say is that people that are selling puts
584.48s: at the 125 handle, the 120 handle,
587.96s: it's just an interesting position that's probably designed
590.32s: to do something very specific with an apportfolio.
593.36s: This doesn't necessarily look like
595.16s: a highly speculative position to me,
596.96s: because I do not think that people are selling these puts
599.64s: expecting GameStop to fly up and out of this.
604.56s: That they would make way more money
606.00s: if they use long calls than short puts for that.
609.88s: But if they wanna collect a little bit of positive theta,
613.24s: and if they have a little bit more stuff in the portfolio
615.48s: that they're looking to offset
616.64s: while still having some long deltas,
618.88s: there's a lot of different specific reasons
621.16s: why this position could be structured the way it is.
623.76s: But I wouldn't consider this a highly speculative trade,
627.00s: although there is speculation clearly going on here.
629.64s: This is a little bit more of what I would consider
631.36s: to be like an inside trade.
633.68s: These are smaller sizes, they're deep in the money,
636.08s: so the margin requirement on these positions
638.04s: is not gonna be insane.
640.08s: And yeah, I mean, we can take a quick look at those out
644.32s: in 16.26 here.
648.20s: And we can see where they're starting to get active,
651.16s: which again, it's just still not a tremendous amount of volume.
655.80s: There's decent volume, right?
657.68s: 77 and 86.50, there's decent volume,
660.92s: but it's not like crazy volume, anything that I would be shocked
664.80s: about, like none of these even exceed the existing open interest.
668.80s: So they look like interesting positions
670.28s: that people are building out.
671.44s: Here, they could just be trying to capture this extrinsic value,
675.24s: capturing on a little bit of put skew,
677.00s: maybe be able to take in a little bit of these moves
679.96s: when they get price accommodation,
681.36s: but these aren't nearly as speculative as buying something
684.44s: like long calls.
685.40s: They won't make as much money in that scenario.
687.16s: They need a really big move before they would pay out
689.32s: pretty meaningfully.
690.64s: So the punchline here is, we will keep an eye on them.
695.36s: As always, if there's any questions,
696.52s: anything you want me to take a look at, send it to me.
698.92s: I'm happy to take a look.
700.28s: I'll see you guys on YouTube live later today,
701.88s: be an outlier.
702.88s: Catch you guys later.
