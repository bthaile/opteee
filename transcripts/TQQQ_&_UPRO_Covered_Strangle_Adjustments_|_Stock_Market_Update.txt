0.64s: what's up outliers quick market update
2.40s: bit of a day out there we don't have a
5.00s: live stream today we're running a new
6.92s: Cadence the live streams will be Tuesday
8.36s: and Thursday so we'll run a couple of
11.32s: these Market updates in the meantime to
13.24s: tie us over so what happened today
16.24s: pretty big Market reversal the market
18.44s: was down a pretty solid portion of the
21.92s: day and then towards the tail end it
24.00s: started to rotate back over so we take a
27.28s: look at Futures here this is just the
30.16s: micro e minis you can see that through
33.68s: most of last week started off down open
37.12s: up today 13th and we opened up really
40.56s: soft and we were rolling down through
43.16s: this and then we got bid back up that
47.28s: was very curious to me so if we grab SPX
50.56s: instead which we'll have a little bit
52.04s: more um follow through you'll notice the
54.96s: size of the candles here is very
56.12s: different it's just because there's more
57.64s: transactions going on in here in the
59.00s: index itself via options and whatnot so
63.28s: I mean this is still objectively a lower
65.16s: low even though it didn't fall out of
67.28s: bed here I don't think we're out of the
69.28s: woods this still looks like the level to
72.64s: be beat to the downside and I think if
75.80s: we continue to see this downward
77.32s: pressure because it wasn't a great
78.96s: follow-through day to the upside it
80.52s: barely crossed above the close from
83.48s: Friday so this is still rolling over and
87.40s: it's de developing a channel to the
90.16s: downside right so we seeing successive
92.52s: lower highs successive lower lows except
95.20s: for this one but now this one adding in
97.08s: starts to build that out so it's kind of
101.24s: anybody's guess at this point and that's
103.92s: the cool part about trading is we don't
105.28s: really have to know we just have to
107.20s: follow what it's doing and move along
108.88s: with it as best we can so volatility
111.60s: contracted quite a lot it opened up
114.12s: heavy today up over 20 the 20 handle and
118.00s: it fell down below 19 now this is
120.52s: typically a great spot to start
122.72s: considering if you trade volatility some
124.84s: trades in here you can either trade it
127.16s: the
129.56s: nontraditional way I guess you could say
131.52s: and sell puts the reason why you might
133.44s: sell puts into something like this is
135.12s: because the volatility will be very high
137.24s: and then you might get out even as it
139.56s: contracts towards the put slightly
141.24s: unscathed because of IV Contracting and
143.64s: then you kind of protect your wrist to
144.88s: the downside a little bit you could
146.40s: always do long puts um going to be
149.00s: really expensive you're not going to
150.28s: make a whole lot on it on a relative
151.72s: basis but directionally it tends to work
153.56s: again cuz you can see over the last 6
155.84s: months we don't get many runs up above
158.80s: 20 and when we do see runs up above 20
161.88s: they're not that long in duration even
164.76s: if we go all the way back to the drop
166.16s: that we saw in August of last year you
167.56s: can see that we were above 20 here 1 2 3
170.52s: 4 five six days and then on the seventh
174.40s: he no I'm just kidding on the seventh
175.96s: Vicks rested apparently and dropped
177.68s: below 20 for a little bit so that's a
180.56s: typically simple trade it's not like
182.60s: you're going to make a bunch of money on
183.56s: it because everybody knows it but it
185.48s: still is at least something to pay
187.36s: attention to looking across the broader
190.60s: Market though let's grab the indices
194.60s: first and actually let's grab the
197.20s: overall market and we can see a few
200.32s: things I want to run through a couple
201.60s: positions in a second that I updated in
203.96s: tle Qs and in uo the covered strangles
207.16s: cuz today was a day to start making some
209.32s: adjustments to those and I want to keep
210.56s: you up to speed with what's going on but
213.56s: across the sectors we saw materials is
216.84s: starting to base out here right so it
219.68s: actually had a pretty strong day on the
221.24s: day and it's posting a channel not a
224.64s: channel sorry it's posting local lows
227.84s: meaning it's not falling it's not
229.36s: continuing it's starting to consolidate
231.20s: so it's turning into a consolidation
232.68s: Trend whereas Comm Services is still
235.24s: decelerating it bid up slightly today
238.76s: but not much and then energy is still
241.20s: continuing its run energy is likely to
243.36s: continue to look good during this kind
245.56s: of Market condition then we have
247.88s: financials about the same recovery but
250.68s: non too strong and it's still assuming
254.44s: this downtrend as far as we can see now
256.40s: Industrials this is consolidating and
259.36s: potentially starting a trend reversal a
261.32s: little early to tell Tech fell out of
263.60s: bed right so even though it had an okay
265.80s: update it still gapped down which is a
267.88s: pretty big move I know because of of you
270.08s: know the triple
271.56s: Q's um staples lows new lows this has
275.04s: been an easy easy trade to continue to
277.84s: follow we've talked about this for
279.96s: literally months now like at least two
282.08s: months we've been talking about
283.88s: Staples and it continues to show
286.48s: weakness real estate again maybe
289.44s: slightly consolidating but it's still
290.84s: too early to tell if that's local lows
293.24s: or if it's just an update that's likely
294.84s: to continue utilities down day it's not
299.04s: looking healthy
300.44s: Healthcare is again rling a little bit
304.76s: it's kind of the the stronger I guess
306.44s: you could say between energy and
307.68s: Healthcare but neither one of them look
309.88s: great and then discretionary is still
313.28s: downtrending
315.12s: so for those that are wondering this is
317.80s: defense and defense is consolidating for
321.32s: some time now so across the market
323.88s: breath doesn't look uh super great now
327.44s: we did see that turnaround today so it
329.28s: led to more names advancing than I would
331.76s: have expected and we can see the change
333.84s: in the 5day and 1 month advancers
336.52s: decliners for the total Market
338.84s: components so the market is still
342.12s: rotating over that's what this tells me
344.44s: it's too early to call it heads or tails
346.92s: in either way but I do think having some
349.88s: sort of long inverse Deltas is probably
355.32s: not off the table so when I say long
356.80s: inverse Deltas it's essentially beta
358.48s: weighted Deltas that are negative that
360.72s: were long and the reason why I say long
362.48s: is just because it controls risk a
364.20s: little bit more than being um overall
367.24s: short options into that so the easier
369.36s: way to think of it is just being short
371.28s: beta weighted Deltas but using some sort
374.00s: of long premium strategy that is
378.40s: essentially what we're seeing across the
380.24s: market today now from an economics
382.24s: perspective we had a few things come out
384.52s: that were absolutely important so CPI
387.88s: came in light it is expected at 5.3 came
391.20s: in at 5.22 which is not actually super
395.00s: great inflation expectations came in
397.96s: pretty close to expectations and then
400.72s: CPI we have to take a look at
402.92s: year-over-year and month over month so
405.64s: we'll jump on that in a second but first
407.80s: I just want to pop over and see from a
410.92s: broad Market
412.24s: perspective what news is being
414.60s: highlighted here so this is through bar
418.04s: chart just coming through and seeing
419.64s: what they're flagging um NASDAQ down we
423.64s: know crude
426.12s: oil yeah there's a relationship but
428.56s: that's been a little bit weaker so this
431.20s: is definitely a big big big Focus right
434.04s: now is CPI coming out Wednesday we can
436.96s: see from a Fed rate cut
440.44s: perspective there's been really no
442.44s: change in the expectation of no change
444.44s: so there's not a lot changing here to
447.60s: use the the word three times in a row
449.88s: but there really isn't right so if we
451.76s: look at a day ago it was
453.64s: 96.8% chance of no change 97.3 right so
457.04s: the Market's not expecting a change in
458.96s: 29 March or 29 Jan if we look in 19
462.84s: March it's still higher probability of
464.64s: no change and then if we look at 7 May
467.16s: it's still highest probability of no
469.00s: change and then if we go all the way out
470.56s: to 18 June that's when we get a slight
472.96s: Edge on a potential ease so one of the
476.76s: things I really like to do is track this
479.60s: because you can see the near-term
481.60s: changes in expectations happening real
483.76s: time in other levels of expectation so
487.60s: you can see from the 9th of Jan
491.36s: specifically looking at the blue line
492.68s: that I'm hovering on for the federal
494.60s: fund rate to be targeted at 4 and A4 to
496.72s: 4 and a half it's at
498.68s: 27% and then it jumps to 44 so there's
502.80s: still again like a a lot of changing
507.04s: underlying expectations and what this
508.60s: might look like but
509.96s: it's all centered around very little
513.20s: overall impact likely to happen here all
515.92s: right so let's take a look now at a
517.92s: couple changes that we had today in the
519.96s: leveraged coverage stringle portfolio So
522.80s: today we're going to talk about tqs and
524.40s: upro and you can see I'm still very
527.24s: light in both of these we actually took
529.32s: some risk off today in the sense of when
531.60s: we were rolling some in the money short
534.36s: puts we got much better strikes which
536.40s: decreases the total amount of cash
537.96s: secured requirement to for the position
540.40s: so then that ends up decreasing our
541.84s: utilization even though the position
543.36s: size you'll notice will be the same to
545.24s: summarize what I just said I didn't
547.56s: change any of the lot sizes but because
550.20s: the strikes did change the overall
552.44s: amount of money I need to cash secure it
555.12s: decreased which decreases the total
557.76s: utilization thus the percent utilization
560.92s: this is a tactical move at this point
564.88s: because I don't really care for what the
568.60s: market is sitting at right now again I
570.52s: don't think it's end of days anything
572.28s: like that but this isn't where I want to
574.28s: be Overexposed which is why I'm so light
577.36s: on these two sub 50% and I will stay
579.60s: this way as long as I need to the other
582.04s: thing that you'll notice it's not sorry
584.84s: it's not on this one it's on another one
586.20s: that I track that will monitor the
588.04s: notional exposure but remember tqs and
592.04s: uo they're essentially both three times
594.40s: the underlying itself so this is
596.00s: essentially behaving as $300,000 a spy
598.56s: and then this is is essentially behaving
600.44s: as 120ish K of TQ so it's already
603.52s: levered that's why I don't need to add
605.76s: too much risk here it's one of the
607.00s: benefits of trading the strategy okay so
608.96s: what changed today well pretty easy
611.16s: stuff in tqs don't have a lot out but I
614.52s: did have this position and it was
617.08s: expiring this coming Friday I had the
619.16s: 82s the 82 puts and these were already
622.72s: rolled once so you can see I took those
627.28s: down this was I think a a little while
630.20s: ago if I'm not mistaken that I
632.32s: originally adjusted this rooll and I
634.76s: flattened out this was the call side
636.44s: sorry I had flattened out the call side
639.36s: and then the main adjustments came on
641.20s: the put side because here's what
644.56s: happened I originally just took in these
647.36s: 83s for a small bit of profit to
649.60s: reposition and break out the lots to be
651.92s: in a couple different expirations and
653.48s: this was also just taking some of the
654.84s: risk down I had talked about that so
656.88s: then the primary adjustment today was in
659.84s: this trade where we were almost on to
662.96s: expiration I had the 83 puts that were
665.68s: expiring 17 Jan they were originally a
667.72s: 30 Delta took them down obviously they
669.40s: were in the money by a bit they were
670.52s: like a 70 Delta I took those in for
672.96s: $8.25 and then I offered this trunch
677.08s: here for 850 so I didn't change size but
680.04s: I did improve my basis by three points
683.28s: there's a reason why that matters if you
685.84s: take a look at this down here I just
687.76s: updated the information with the trade
689.80s: so you can see what happened and
692.36s: essentially I've taken the basis
694.64s: adjustment down by
695.96s: 3.6% I've reduced the cash secured
698.92s: requirement for the trade by 600 bucks
700.52s: not much but again on something that's
702.32s: only 44k allocated it's not a trivial
705.16s: amount of money and really we need this
708.96s: to be trading we need this option right
711.08s: here to be trading at 281 before we hit
714.28s: our break even where we could
716.04s: perspectively close this trade and then
718.80s: um move on you know with a profit
722.08s: without taking it all the way to
723.16s: expiration again this is why
724.92s: understanding rolling options is so
726.24s: important I have a video I'll link to
728.24s: that in the notes below that talks about
729.56s: it because this number matters a lot you
731.16s: don't have to take this all the way to
732.32s: expiration and I don't intend to cool so
735.96s: now let's take a look at upro uo was a
739.84s: little bit of the same so we can see
741.92s: that there's actually two trones that
744.08s: got adjusted today a six lot and a three
746.36s: lot and then also the short call side of
748.40s: things we'll start with the short call
749.48s: cuz that's easier from the short call
751.16s: side of things I literally just took
753.36s: them down I had the 102s that were a 30
756.60s: Delta 21 Feb took them in for 40 cents
760.40s: so that gave me 145 bucks and then I
763.76s: offered one more so same lot size same
767.52s: expiration but I just took them in
768.92s: further to the 95s which are 22 Delta
771.00s: the 95 is still above my basis by just a
772.92s: little bit but this allows me to
775.24s: increase my total premium without adding
776.80s: size on the call side of things I still
778.84s: have 100 shares that are uncapped too
780.64s: early to cap those and then on the put
783.48s: side we did have to play some games so
786.96s: on the put side of things this is what
790.32s: came down today I had the '90s
793.32s: out both for 17 genan the '90s and the
796.32s: 88s I sold them for 180 165 respectively
800.12s: and then I took them in for 560 410
802.48s: respectively so you can see that that
804.68s: brings the realized p&l on the put side
807.04s: of things to negative 20 802 this is
810.80s: again why rolling options is important
812.52s: to pay attention to because this even
814.88s: though it shows negative I do have
816.60s: enough to overcome that loss however
819.48s: this is realized this is unrealized
822.68s: these trades are open they can turn
824.32s: against me even more forcing me to make
826.68s: even more adjustments but what I ended
829.20s: up doing was taking the 90s to 86s and
833.48s: then the 88s to 85s they're both in 21
836.24s: Feb they're 50 Delta 46 Delta so as
839.16s: actually able to put these out
840.92s: essentially right at the money which is
842.24s: great it's a great basis adjustment
843.72s: because these were both in the money at
846.08s: the time of adjusting so had a really
849.44s: healthy move on the overall basis so
852.68s: again showing you those metrics down
854.12s: here on the six slot we were able to
856.12s: reduce our bases by
858.76s: 4.4% and then we reduced total cash
861.68s: secured requirement by 2400 bucks every
863.92s: time this happens we're reducing total
865.44s: risk which is good and then on the three
867.92s: lot we reduced that by
869.56s: 3.4% again took down $900 of risk so now
873.80s: we're just hanging out this is where
876.24s: both of these sit today now from an
877.88s: analysis perspective I'm going to
879.72s: conduct the analysis on the underlying
881.40s: itself meaning spy uh versus uo just
884.92s: because this is the dominant index that
887.16s: it's based off of and I already
889.40s: explained most of my thoughts here where
891.80s: I still expect more downside potential
895.04s: based on the broader Trend that we're
897.12s: seeing here and as long as this trend
900.28s: remains like this I'm going to remain
902.12s: defensive in my positioning so if we
904.52s: take a look at drawing like a basic
906.64s: trend line here and then another trend
910.36s: line really it kind of starts from here
913.52s: is but we're very clearly in a negative
917.64s: trend on these this price level is
919.72s: really important and we'll see how it
922.16s: behaves if it gets a rally if it does
924.16s: rally does it start approaching this but
926.60s: with no rate Cuts coming up and earnings
929.00s: coming up unless earnings are smash out
931.72s: everything looks good this just
934.08s: generally looks like more room to the
935.76s: downside and in Q's is even worse
938.68s: because Q's is in a clearly defined
942.08s: downtrend at this point um and it has
945.84s: the broader uh this isn't clicking for
948.04s: some reason there we go has the broader
950.00s: descending channel to show it and this
952.24s: is already below this support so not
955.40s: only does that not bode well for Q's but
957.80s: that doesn't bode well for the Market
959.48s: because Tech has been such a massive
962.32s: element propping things up Futures are
964.56s: up right now so it's a little early to
966.96s: tell we'll take a dive into this stuff
969.84s: later today during the live stream but
971.24s: wanted to give you a quick recap on what
973.60s: I saw some trade adjustments as always
975.20s: if there's anything you want me to take
976.16s: a look at a stock you want to analyze
978.16s: together let me know we can take care of
979.80s: that be an outlier I'll see you later
