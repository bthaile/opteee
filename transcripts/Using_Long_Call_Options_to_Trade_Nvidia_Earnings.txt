0.24s: aha it is NVIDIA the bell of the ball
3.08s: the conversation that everybody can't
4.96s: stop having because it uses the terms AI
8.68s: well I want to walk you through an
10.28s: earnings trade that I ran in Nvidia that
14.08s: turned out to be a pretty handsome
16.08s: winning position to the tune of over
18.24s: $30,000 on a 20 some th000 investment
22.64s: and there's a couple things that I want
23.80s: to discuss in this video I want to talk
25.36s: about the analysis ahead of time the
26.92s: trade as I structured it and then the
28.52s: management once the trade was on so
30.76s: let's get straight into it what's up
32.76s: everybody welcome back to the outliers
34.28s: shout out to the patreon family let's
35.56s: get right into this thing so as you can
37.36s: see Nvidia had earnings on the 22nd
42.12s: after the close and there was a lot of
45.60s: really interesting factors going into
48.00s: this earnings release I actually covered
50.24s: some of it in the patreon channel and
52.44s: then also on a couple of the YouTube
54.36s: lives leading into this release and I
57.04s: highlight that because one of the things
59.32s: we ident ified going into this release
62.52s: was actually some pretty bullish
64.68s: positioning for the options change
67.00s: surrounding the earnings take a walk
69.08s: with me into thinker swim so down at the
72.12s: bottom I'm just showing you a reference
74.12s: this is what it looks like right now
75.64s: using the forward-looking expirations
78.20s: and right now if you look at the call
80.64s: open interest this is across all
82.24s: expirations there's
83.64s: 1.68 million and then the put open
86.44s: interest is 1. 1627 so still very very
89.68s: slight call skew but notice how similar
91.72s: those are it's essentially same same
94.60s: slightly bullish call skew which is
96.84s: actually abnormal by itself you
98.48s: typically would see putsu but I want to
100.40s: show you what I saw leading into the
102.84s: Nvidia earnings release and we're
105.44s: actually going to use on demand for this
108.04s: so I've just gone back in time it's
109.64s: loading right now it takes a second and
112.04s: we're now looking at 22 May at
115.24s: 0902 Pacific time so in the morning and
118.28s: let's take a look at the the same data
121.36s: that I'm showing you and I'll scoot this
122.80s: over so that you can see a little bit
124.12s: more of that side so here's what we have
126.60s: if we look at all expirations we see 1.9
131.20s: million calls and 1.8 million puts so
136.36s: pretty noteworthy call skew still but
139.60s: this is across all expirations I want to
141.84s: know what it looks like for earnings so
143.72s: what I first do is look at the release
146.64s: that encompasses just earnings here we
149.48s: have 62,000 calls versus
152.32s: 197,000 puts on a percentage basis that
155.64s: is a very meaningful call skew now if we
158.20s: add the next expiration for 31 may we go
161.04s: to 352,000 calls to 265,000 puts and
165.52s: then if we go to one more expiration
167.52s: just to kind of see how far out this
169.16s: goes in time we go to 392,000 calls and
172.44s: 291,000 puts so what I'm highlighting is
175.48s: a really interesting situation here now
178.80s: one of the things to not is when people
181.44s: institutions sophisticated investors
183.76s: have a thesis about a directional move
186.00s: through earnings more often than not
188.24s: they're going to use options to trade it
190.60s: because of the leverage provided so when
193.24s: I see this kind of skew around an
195.80s: earnings release I'm at least going to
198.36s: consider it a little more seriously
200.28s: that's a really interesting effect now
202.08s: it's not quite as simple as just looking
204.32s: at that seeing call skew and then
205.96s: thinking ston go up a little more to it
209.04s: than just that which which I'll help
210.76s: explain now so if we go back over here
214.64s: and we take a look at the previous
216.00s: earnings that we've seen a couple notes
218.64s: when I look at the past 11 earnings it
222.44s: had a few that saw pretty significant up
226.28s: moves but just a few that moved down
229.84s: meaning in terms of the implied Move
231.48s: versus the realized move so the expected
233.76s: move for this release was around 7.8%
235.96s: the largest down move of the past 11 was
238.24s: 7.6% and there weren't many down moves
241.64s: so what I did was adjust how I was
244.40s: looking at this and how I was going to
245.84s: play it based on this data so first I
249.08s: see really interesting call skew then I
251.92s: see a really persistent Trend in Nvidia
255.96s: where if we take a look at this other
257.52s: chart again the actual EPS earnings per
260.96s: share has been beating Wall Street
263.32s: estimates for some time I also see that
266.76s: the instances of post moves that that
269.96s: tend to be larger are all to the upside
273.08s: so notice here during this earnings
274.68s: release it had a Miss to the downside
277.52s: and it wasn't that significant however
280.60s: when we look at these moves to the
281.92s: upside they tend to be pretty massive so
284.84s: I was trading a little bit of this
287.36s: upside thesis for earnings under the
290.60s: assumption that I don't think Nvidia is
292.76s: slowing down just yet I see continued
295.40s: earnings per share growth I see
297.32s: continued positive reaction to the
299.12s: position so or to the stock I should say
301.92s: so really what I was looking at here is
304.16s: very different than the way that I
306.00s: typically trade earnings so as you can
308.32s: see as a joke I have YOLO long calls
310.52s: it's obviously not a YOLO I actually
312.80s: think most Traders should abolish that
314.68s: term from their terminology but again
317.04s: it's still funny not to think about all
318.72s: the Wall Street bets degenerates that
320.36s: made probably the same trade I did but
322.84s: here I am kind of conducting this
324.40s: analysis and I'm sure a lot of them
326.36s: literally are just thinking Nvidia go up
328.84s: and we probably had the same outcome
330.32s: except actually probably some of them
332.00s: made way more money than me because
333.36s: they'll risk their entire portfolio on
335.24s: an idea like this isn't that depressing
338.04s: but anyways let's take a look at what I
340.12s: was thinking I already walked you
341.28s: through kind of the general hypothesis
343.12s: here the portfolio fit this is in a
345.04s: speculative allocation and the profit
346.68s: mechanism for this individual position
348.88s: is a post earnings release Direction
351.76s: move that is accommodating to my
353.88s: position most of the time when I'm
355.60s: trading earnings which I'll throw a
358.40s: video in the description below that
360.28s: walks you through how I typically trade
362.52s: earnings which is with short options to
364.84s: trade the contraction of implied
367.32s: volatility so if you take a look at the
369.64s: way that implied volatility tends to
371.60s: move post earnings in most instances it
373.96s: tends to contract however Nvidia has
377.16s: been a little bit of a an anomaly in
380.44s: that sense where a lot of its post
382.52s: earnings moves have actually been pretty
384.64s: significant but you can still see when
386.88s: we look at the implied move around these
389.56s: earnings releases it still tends to
391.08s: contract as they do around earnings so
394.68s: there a really important note because as
397.76s: I'm highlighting here why would I buy
399.76s: premium into an event that I know tends
403.16s: to have a contraction in volatility
405.84s: which would hurt this position so why
407.48s: would I do that and throw your answer in
410.52s: the comments below and I'll give it to
412.28s: you now which is because I was expecting
415.80s: a large enough move to overwhelm the
418.88s: contraction in volatility that's what
420.80s: this trade was based on so when I looked
422.88s: at my targets for the position I was
425.12s: looking for a 15% down move as we talked
428.68s: about that would result in a $177,000
430.80s: loss on the position or an 8% up move
433.92s: which is conservatively using the
436.52s: expected move so notice what I do here I
439.64s: am conservatively estimating the upside
442.44s: potential by using the expected move but
444.76s: then when I'm calculating the probable
446.44s: Max risk factor I had edit that before
448.56s: because it was wrong I missed the word
450.72s: Max I used much larger than both the
454.36s: expected move and the largest down move
456.68s: of the past 11 I'm trading this in a
459.56s: conservative structure as I'm using
461.88s: these inputs to determine my size using
463.92s: this conservative profile so I'm buying
467.04s: premium into the earnings release
469.08s: because I think we could see a big
471.52s: enough move that it would compensate for
473.36s: this so the next question then is why
475.96s: would I go out to 21 June again throw
478.12s: your thoughts to that in
480.00s: the comments below and I'll give you the
482.00s: answer now which is I wasn't fully
485.04s: confident like our standard Wall Street
487.96s: bets degenerates that we necessarily
490.68s: would see the move immediately after
492.92s: earnings Part of Me Was preparing for a
496.44s: reasonable earnings move but then might
499.64s: see some positive drift afterwards so
503.08s: that's why I didn't use the week ending
506.04s: although there's a tradeoff here if I
508.52s: used the shorter term expiration so
511.64s: instead of going to 21 June if I had
514.04s: gone to 24 May I would have paid less so
516.72s: I would see a larger percent increase on
519.60s: the premium that I paid but overall I
522.68s: wanted to give the position a little
524.60s: time to drift if we saw a nice big up
527.48s: move kind of like what we're in now so
529.60s: if you haven't noticed the position that
531.16s: I put on on 22 May was six of the 21
534.52s: June 945 calls and I bought them for $
536.96s: 4478 which is about a 27 ,000 Delta they
540.76s: were a little over 5 uh 52 to 55 Deltas
544.12s: when I scaled in and why would I go with
546.88s: 55 Deltas well a couple reasons a lot of
549.88s: the times when I'm trading something
551.20s: like a ratio called diagonal or even
552.96s: long options that I'm expecting to turn
554.88s: into a ratio called diagonal or put
557.00s: diagonal is I'll go deeper in the money
559.64s: on the Deltas but again the premise on
563.08s: this trade was a large directional move
566.08s: post earnings so I wanted to give the
568.60s: position a good opportunity to compound
572.00s: which is why I went with 55 Deltas it
574.20s: strikes a balance where I'm close to the
576.76s: money so I still get a decent dollar for
578.96s: dooll move in the underlying but it's
580.84s: not so deep in the money that I can't
582.68s: compound as effectively as I would if I
586.12s: bought something you know that was
587.96s: further out of the money that then moved
589.96s: into the money so that's why so let's
592.08s: see how this trade moved on so then as
594.64s: you can see on the 23rd of may we did
596.84s: see a pretty nice pop so before the
599.68s: release we closed at essentially 950 and
603.48s: after the release we opened at 1020
605.76s: ultimately closing at 10:37 and it was a
609.44s: healthy up move post earnings but
611.80s: actually slightly within the expected
613.92s: move so on 23 may I ended up selling
617.40s: four of these
620.16s: at805 which gave me
622.16s: $47,000 of a credit which takes the
625.04s: realized p&l of the four to $29,000
629.76s: so now I still have a $29,000 profit
633.48s: which means it puts me in the profit
636.08s: Zone on the entire position just trading
638.72s: these and I still have a couple on so
642.36s: why would I just close four again if you
645.56s: know the answer throw it in the comments
647.68s: but the answer is pretty simple I
650.20s: already alluded before that I wanted to
652.52s: see the potential for drift where if it
655.72s: continues to move in my direction I can
657.84s: trade the post earnings announcement
659.88s: drift and that's exactly why I wanted to
662.56s: leave a couple on so we have the latest
666.00s: on the 24th of May I closed one of the
669.28s: 21 June 945 at1 12464 which is a
672.24s: $112,000 credit till the cumulative pnl
675.52s: in the position now is
677.60s: 37,42 so we're left with a decision
680.40s: Point how do we handle the last leg here
683.80s: because I still have one leg on and I'm
686.84s: looking at this today on the 26th of May
689.40s: and in hindsight I actually don't know
692.48s: if I wanted to close this there I think
694.52s: part of this is my risk aversion that
696.16s: comes through as a Trader that I'm
697.36s: working on but in this case I thought
701.68s: that the move on the next day was still
704.28s: good and I still had plenty of room to
705.92s: take the profit but my original thesis
709.08s: for the trade was to close it post
711.48s: earnings after I got my move maybe trade
713.84s: the follow through on the next day or
715.20s: two what I hadn't originally thought
717.52s: about and again this is one of the
718.84s: errors I made when I was formatting this
721.12s: position is I didn't originally think
723.80s: about potentially turning it into a
726.28s: ratio called diagonal which in this case
728.80s: actually can make a lot of sense because
730.92s: essentially what I would do now is set a
734.28s: stop that would occur right here where
737.24s: if price closes below 1020 I would exit
739.76s: the whole position for a profit but then
741.60s: give it room to run that's essentially
743.60s: what I'm going to do now going forward
746.28s: but if I had not closed this I could
749.32s: have had a two lot to trade at a better
752.36s: ratio and if you're not familiar with
754.04s: the ratio called diagonal I'll throw a
755.88s: video in the description below but
758.28s: essentially I have one Runner left out
761.16s: that is completely paid for I can't get
763.16s: hurt on it at all and I'm going to trade
765.60s: it like a diagonal but this is very
768.60s: different than I typically trade
769.68s: earnings and it's because of those
770.92s: little pieces I saw leading into the
773.00s: release now in terms of sizing in the
774.84s: portfolio this was a very small position
777.04s: so even though you might see $26,000 I
779.24s: don't want you to think that it's wise
781.32s: to go out there and start betting you
782.92s: know 10% of your portfolio on an
785.52s: earnings move like this it's unwise at
787.72s: best so this is still a very small
790.36s: subset of the portfolio but that was the
792.76s: overall thesis behind the trade and kind
794.56s: of some of the things I picked up to get
796.20s: me there if you have any questions throw
797.64s: them in the comments below be an outlier
800.24s: like subscribe share see you guys later
