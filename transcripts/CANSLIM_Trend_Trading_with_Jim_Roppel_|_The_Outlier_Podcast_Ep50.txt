2.10s: what's up everybody Eric here we are
4.32s: back with the outlier podcast and I got
6.60s: my friend Jim ropel here he and I
8.88s: actually we connected like almost a year
11.40s: ago and then we kind of you know fell
13.20s: off for a little bit but I'm absolutely
15.12s: stoked to have you on I have done a lot
17.28s: of homework and I follow a lot of what
19.74s: you talk about and I am really excited
21.90s: to dive into your approach to the
23.58s: markets because as we were talking about
24.72s: right before we started a lot of what
26.64s: you do is different than what I do and
28.80s: that's one of my favorite Parts about
30.96s: the podcast one is I get to learn about
32.82s: other approaches but then two we get to
35.10s: put different ideas in front of people
36.60s: and then let them see what works for
38.40s: them because there's a lot of ways to
39.54s: make money in the market so welcome to
41.58s: the podcast thanks for taking some time
43.62s: to hang out thank you very much for
45.96s: having me here it did take a long time
48.00s: to get this scheduled but we're doing it
50.52s: that's it you know what the thing is
52.26s: it's like I'm not always great at stuff
54.42s: but I'm pretty damn persistent man so
57.00s: like I'm always around so whenever it
59.04s: lines up It lines up if it doesn't it
60.96s: doesn't say la vie but I'm actually
63.12s: really really stoked that we had a
65.58s: chance to line up because like I was
66.72s: telling you right before we started I am
68.70s: uh not like a good friend but I know
70.68s: Matt Cruz so pretty well he and I have
72.30s: talked quite a few times and I get a
74.52s: chance to talk about kind of like the
76.14s: you know small cab growth stock style
78.56s: that's a lot of you know can slim
82.02s: um based but I know that you obviously
84.48s: had a relationship with Bill O'Neil
86.52s: talk to me a little bit about your
88.56s: background there's a lot of information
89.88s: out there I'll put a link to your
91.50s: website in the notes below for people
93.78s: that want to like really dive in and
95.40s: learn all about you but to get like a
97.86s: high level summary just to introduce you
99.66s: to the audience at least my audience so
101.16s: that they kind of an idea of where
102.78s: you're approaching this thing from just
104.34s: a quick background on how you got
106.02s: started in markets and kind of generally
108.00s: what your approach looks like
110.70s: um you know my
112.62s: dad my grandfather worked at Bailey
115.50s: pinball machines in the Stamping Plant
117.26s: this is 80 years ago or more and Bali
120.72s: came public and he got stock as an
122.64s: employee I mean he was a factory worker
124.32s: and so my dad started to watch Bailey my
126.90s: grandfather my dad always talk about it
128.40s: and then
129.90s: um I went to college and my two best
132.06s: friends happen to be both very much into
133.80s: the market one of their fathers was a
135.48s: stock broker I opened an account with
136.86s: him and just the people around me were
138.96s: in now my dad had no money okay I don't
140.64s: want to confuse things my grandfather
141.96s: had like you know 38 shares of that
143.58s: Bally or something there we go and um
146.28s: but my buddies were very into it and we
148.56s: studied the markets the crash of 87
151.02s: happened I I took four and a half years
153.48s: because I was persistent to get there to
156.60s: graduate and in 87 I graduated the crash
159.78s: really shaped me and I went on an
162.00s: interview for a job as a stock broker
164.76s: which I didn't realize was it called a
166.02s: cold call Cowboy was it a stack bro
168.06s: because no you know analysis going on it
171.18s: was a sales job I was hired
172.98s: and I was a loser in the markets for
175.32s: many years and one day I went to the
179.70s: 7-Eleven where they had Space Invaders
181.50s: Valley Michigan that was a valley Midway
183.84s: machine and I got an IBD an Investors
187.32s: Business Daily
188.52s: and I read it and then I read the Bill's
191.82s: book how to make money in stocks and
193.74s: that was the game changer my life
196.14s: immediately changed number one reason
198.96s: was I let my losses run when I was a kid
201.06s: this is a long time ago okay this is
203.40s: 1987. 1980 88 89
208.26s: um I was fascinated by the markets and
211.02s: what they could do and I love the
212.46s: interaction of
213.84s: weather news Innovation interest rates
216.54s: politics I mean everything it fascinated
219.78s: me I loved it and I
222.06s: immediate after I started cutting my
223.80s: losses I started to implement better
225.72s: selection criteria and then technical
227.34s: analysis and my results will immediately
230.88s: stop losing money like
233.22s: um
233.88s: and then with time and learning how to
236.04s: implement my results started to get
238.14s: better and very good and very very good
239.84s: and I
241.86s: eliminated the boom bust
244.14s: and I became more consistent
246.96s: and then I started occasionally every
249.54s: few years to tangle up into a very big
251.58s: stock and I made some pretty big money a
254.64s: couple times and that's the background
257.04s: man
258.00s: yeah it's awesome it's so fascinating to
260.46s: me how many people I talked to on this
261.90s: that have so many similar aspects to
264.72s: their background and how this whole
266.58s: thing started I think you know as you're
268.62s: talking about you're just general
270.00s: interest in the connection between
271.62s: things I 100 identify with that it's
273.96s: like looking at the markets is one of my
276.12s: favorite ways to learn about our world
278.52s: because especially like all these
280.44s: different news sources they're so
281.70s: political like you never can figure out
283.26s: like what the I'm reading but then
285.24s: when I'm reading about anything from a
287.52s: financial perspective like they don't
288.84s: give a like if it makes dollars it
290.22s: makes sense if it doesn't it doesn't but
291.78s: it's like typically a pretty decent way
293.94s: to consume information and the other
295.26s: thing you said that I really identified
296.64s: with is the disposition effect where
298.86s: Traders tend to let losses run cut
300.78s: winners too short I think that's like
302.76s: one of the the first pivotal things that
304.86s: we all eventually change so it's funny
307.14s: that you highlighted that one as well
309.78s: um quick follow-on question for you when
312.90s: you first read bill O'Neill's book did
316.02s: you look at this optimistically and like
318.66s: did it click and you were like oh I've
320.52s: been doing this wrong I think this will
322.20s: work or was it more of uh I don't really
325.14s: know let me just try see if it works I'm
327.12s: curious how you approach the world of
328.80s: technical analysis specifically because
330.60s: a lot of people they'll say it's either
332.76s: Voodoo or it's not you know that kind of
334.62s: stuff
336.72s: um I need to tell you a little bit about
338.28s: my disposition I am very questioning and
341.52s: counter-intuitive and if you tell me no
343.92s: that means I'm going to do that and my
346.80s: buddy gave me a book called a random
348.60s: walk down Wall Street and I read it and
350.94s: I'm like this is I said this is
354.18s: right for most people but not except not
356.28s: people who are willing to do things that
358.32s: others aren't and then I read about
359.64s: people who were the outliers and I said
362.46s: most people will never be an exceptional
363.90s: outlier because they won't apply
365.16s: themselves so I read Bill's book
368.04s: and it there are many styles many
370.80s: there's probably 30 styles on how to
372.66s: invest you have to find one that
374.64s: resonates with your nature it's got to
376.44s: agree with your DNA
378.54s: Mo there are a lot of styles that work
380.52s: but they won't work for the wrong person
382.14s: or they won't work if doesn't agree with
383.58s: you and it agreed with me very well and
385.32s: I by coach so well and I felt like
388.38s: through the book bill was talking to me
390.54s: and then I started to go to see him just
392.94s: when he would speak initially he would
394.98s: speak for free and then the price went
396.48s: to 300 bucks then 500 and then 10 000.
398.88s: and uh I I went to see Bill probably two
403.38s: to three times a year starting in around
405.12s: 19
407.12s: 90 ish
409.74s: until a few years ago and so I oh well I
413.58s: also became an Institutional customer of
415.80s: William O'Neill when I opened my first
417.18s: hedge fund where I would talk to Bill
418.56s: all the time I mean so the I'm trying to
422.34s: answer your question I might have gotten
423.84s: on a little bit of a tangent
425.40s: no it was perfect because essentially
427.80s: you were helping me understand how you
430.26s: approach the methodology and how it
431.64s: resonated with you because like I said
433.68s: before when you know I I actually just
436.50s: interviewed Tom sosnov not too long ago
438.90s: another time who's a big options Trader
441.18s: not sure if you're familiar with him he
442.86s: runs a pretty big Network and you know
444.96s: he came from the pits and for him he
448.26s: built think or Swim which is a pretty
449.82s: popular platform and like when they
451.44s: first built it it didn't have charts
453.48s: because they never used them they all
455.52s: thought charts was like Wizardry
458.10s: so
459.66s: a lot of people I find have like this
462.54s: polar relationship with technical
465.00s: analysis but it sounds like it really
466.74s: resonated with you like when you looked
468.24s: at it you're like this makes sense I can
471.18s: get behind this idea I think if you look
474.42s: at the book all the market Wizards books
477.42s: you look at all the greatest traders in
479.22s: the world there's only one that I'm
481.50s: aware of Michael steinhardt who's a
483.18s: Fundamentalist
484.26s: all I don't like absolute terms
487.20s: everyone I'm aware of outside of
488.76s: steinhardt
489.96s: was a trend follower and charts are a
493.32s: visual way to follow a trend I don't
496.38s: really think charts are predictive
499.26s: I think charts give you a clue of the
501.72s: trend and Trends fail most Trends fail
505.50s: most breakouts fail why is why risk
509.52s: management is so critical that's kept me
511.14s: in the business for 30 I know I started
512.94s: in 87 so whatever how long that is I
515.22s: don't know
516.24s: um
517.62s: if you try to Trend file or when you
519.72s: don't have risk management you're gonna
520.74s: get wiped out quickly as a matter of
523.68s: fact the market will seek its level it
527.52s: will find your weakness if you're greedy
530.04s: if you're impulsive if you're fearful if
532.86s: you're I mean it whatever your weakness
535.74s: is
536.82s: um
537.48s: the market is going to expose you
539.16s: quickly and and you're going to learn
541.56s: about yourself very quickly you're going
543.36s: to take a lot of losses and a lot of
545.40s: bruises the number one key to spot a
548.34s: liar is I'm great I'm the greatest I'm
551.52s: killing the market I've killed it every
552.90s: year for a thousand you're lying you
555.96s: talk to the greats and they are except
558.90s: for one or two that I know of and the
560.52s: one guy who thinks he's great has not
562.74s: made any money
564.24s: um the other one is kind of great and he
565.98s: has made a lot of money but he's vocal
567.96s: about but people who are arrogant
570.12s: the market will pound you down it is
572.94s: going to beat you down and you you the
575.76s: market teaches you
577.14s: to be cautious and careful and not
580.08s: arrogant the market will expose your
582.12s: arrogance if you're you know I mean so
584.52s: anyway there's another giant tangent for
586.80s: you well I I love that tangent because I
590.64s: think and that's one of the biggest
591.66s: things I always hypothesize trips a lot
594.12s: of technical traders up is when they
595.62s: apply their analysis they start to say
597.36s: like this should happen and they kind of
600.24s: create their own reality on what they
602.52s: think should happen completely foregoing
604.20s: the fact that the market doesn't give a
606.48s: flying what they think should
609.00s: happen it couldn't possibly care less
610.92s: and to your point that's where a lot of
614.04s: um not speaking in absolutes it's so
615.84s: funny when you said that because I 100
617.76s: resonate with that I refuse to because
620.46s: if I'm looking at a chart I actually
621.96s: like to apply technical analysis but I
624.36s: always view it as like probabilistic
625.92s: outcomes based on what I see what is
628.44s: more probable here or what's the risk to
630.90s: reward here not a determinant this
633.84s: should happen it may or may not I I
636.72s: don't know the most technical patterns
640.62s: whether it's a head and shoulders or a
642.18s: cup and handle or whatever you want to
644.34s: call it
645.18s: the pattern will morph before it emerges
649.74s: out of the pattern you think it's going
651.00s: to uh emerge out of so that's why
653.16s: jumping the gun is such a flaw and
657.96s: um
658.80s: I
660.20s: that's what I wanted to say yeah so
663.78s: speaking of you're kind of approach here
666.12s: and obviously you're talking a little
667.68s: bit about the specific timing element
669.06s: everybody that I know that trades can
671.46s: Slim
672.42s: they
674.22s: tend to have their own twist on things
676.74s: you know they don't necessarily apply
678.78s: like purely what they see in the book So
681.60s: based on your approach to cancel him
684.30s: what's what does that look like is it a
686.70s: pure play based on what I've seen you
688.56s: talk about it doesn't necessarily seem
690.24s: that way so I'd love to dive into kind
692.64s: of your approach to canceling so
695.58s: I think the Japanese had it right
698.64s: why invent anything I am a knockoff
702.24s: artist of a uh someone who's well known
704.40s: who is not a snake or I'll say it's been
707.40s: a Salesman who probably made a billion
709.08s: dollars and if he didn't pay so much in
711.42s: taxes like Buffett you're probably worth
712.74s: billions
714.36s: if I'm half as good
716.70s: half is good and I only make 500 million
720.72s: I'm probably going to be just chill with
722.52s: that I am a not I don't deviate now
725.40s: there are some things that I've learned
726.84s: that I do apply but they're almost
730.80s: tertiary there's things about the market
733.20s: that I've learned that bill didn't cover
734.82s: in the book
736.74s: um
737.64s: and I just I just knocked him off I mean
739.86s: why deviate if you want to build a
741.66s: birdhouse why draw it up on a piece of
744.06s: paper yourself when you buy a book and
746.16s: the guy's going to tell you exactly how
748.02s: to build the most beautiful birdhouse
749.52s: ever now again the saying
755.28s: this difference between a hero and a
757.56s: crowd is one step forward if you do what
759.78s: everyone else does you're not going to
761.46s: be exceptional but I'll respond to that
764.16s: with I saw Bill live in a room with 400
766.20s: people in it and I was and he goes how
768.24s: many people only buy new highs I raised
771.18s: my hand and out of 400 people there was
773.10s: like five
774.54s: the rules the book reminiscences of a
777.12s: stock operator was wrote written in the
778.62s: 1920s 100 years ago roughly the the the
782.42s: manual is there but people can't follow
785.82s: it they either don't have the emotional
788.22s: intelligence don't have the perseverance
790.50s: don't you know there's a lot of reasons
792.90s: people fail but the the road map is
794.88s: there
795.78s: so I am saying
799.08s: I
801.06s: don't want to you know build the clock
803.58s: again without the manual but I want to
805.68s: follow the manual most people won't do
807.42s: that and Bill doesn't talk enough about
809.70s: emotional control
812.04s: um which is really
813.84s: like I said the manuals there the it
815.88s: works but few can implement it because
818.46s: they don't have the discipline they
819.48s: don't have the patience they're
820.38s: emotionally
821.52s: you know they're trying to survive okay
823.92s: think about the and I I I'm a huge
826.62s: Republican okay I was going to say it
828.36s: but I sympathize greatly with a single
830.52s: mom with two children and a deadbeat
833.10s: ex-husband
835.74s: well you know what is her ability to get
838.14s: you clothed fed off to school work her
841.38s: ass off all day get you guys home from
842.82s: school get you dinner and then hit her
843.96s: second job where in there does she get
846.00s: to read Bill's book and then implement
847.50s: it and get 10 grand to start trading
849.54s: with
850.50s: like you know there's a you have to be
853.68s: in the right position and I believe you
855.24s: make your own outcome I I totally
857.22s: believe in self-responsibility you're
859.20s: you are where you are because the
860.64s: decisions you make nobody else everyone
862.92s: has curveballs the meteor flies out of
864.90s: asteroids fly into life and smash your
867.56s: that happens how do you handle that how
870.00s: do you overcome that the losses I took
872.22s: when I was young were horrendous it was
874.56s: emotionally beating but I never gave up
876.66s: ever you know even I have bad years now
880.74s: um you know I've been in the business
883.02s: since 87 to today
885.00s: I probably have a bad year oh I want to
887.22s: say this
889.20s: people
890.76s: who lie say I'm up 30 every single year
893.88s: well that's not possible
896.10s: with the method we use
899.34s: if you're you're going to have very big
901.62s: years and then small losses in years
903.86s: that's why Bernie Madoff suckered
906.54s: everybody because he promised the Holy
908.64s: Grail which was unattainable it was one
910.80s: percent a year I'm sorry one percent a
912.84s: month every month with no down months
915.78s: it's impossible
918.06s: sounds good though yeah it's great
920.70s: compound you compound 12 out a year for
923.46s: 50 years how much money
925.02s: tons literally tons
927.66s: I think um and that's actually funny
929.88s: that you bring that up because that's
931.20s: one of the things I've always revered
932.64s: about the way you guys trade is because
934.76s: you have this streakiness in your
937.50s: performance like when I talk to to Matt
939.12s: I came across as U.S investing
940.68s: Championship performance which is like
942.18s: 300 plus percent in a year so I I trade
945.48s: derivatives I trade both sides primarily
947.52s: options sometimes Futures depending on
949.44s: the product but like my best year ever
951.78s: was just over 50 which I'm super proud
954.36s: of that but that's still like a sad sad
957.90s: comparison to what you guys can produce
960.12s: well I don't know I don't know you know
963.30s: what are your down years like if you can
965.40s: keep your down usable single digits and
967.08s: you have a 50 year every five years and
969.84s: you have a bunch of 20 years
972.26s: 50 is huge
975.24s: 300 with a 200 drawdown or you know an
979.56s: eighty percent that's nothing 50 up
982.38s: years with nine percent max drawdowns
985.86s: you're gonna make money
987.42s: definitely yeah and it's that's
988.92s: essentially what I've built my entire
990.66s: world around is the vast majority of the
993.60s: down years are small and they're super
995.58s: infrequent now I had down years when I
997.50s: first started but to be also very clear
999.36s: I've seen 50 once so I have most of my
1003.02s: time it's somewhere in the 20s so it's
1005.30s: still very it's still really good for me
1007.52s: I'm 32. I'm in the market
1009.74s: uh since 2007 so 16 years
1014.66s: you're 100 years coming
1016.70s: it's in front of you
1019.66s: well I'll keep looking for it because it
1022.28s: hasn't popped up yet but I'm I'm eager
1026.02s: if you want it it'll come
1028.52s: yeah well and that's that's actually one
1030.44s: of the cool things as the account has
1032.00s: grown is I'm really receptive to
1033.80s: different approaches so for a while I
1036.80s: traded a lot of volatility volatility
1038.48s: trading can be very boring it's a more
1040.64s: of a numbers thing and it's an in
1042.44s: aggregate but it's very consistent but I
1046.10s: started developing different strategies
1047.66s: still via derivatives that let me take
1049.40s: advantage of some of the things that you
1050.66s: guys like to look at so that's what I
1052.10s: want to spend a little more time on so
1054.20s: you talked about there are things that
1056.30s: you've learned that bill didn't cover in
1058.10s: the book one of them you were talking
1060.20s: about how you wanted him to talk more
1061.64s: about emotional kind of side of things
1063.20s: but what are some of the specific Market
1065.06s: things that you've amassed over your
1067.16s: career that you don't think Bill covered
1069.68s: in the book
1071.36s: I am very much like Bill
1075.02s: a tremendous Optimist and but I'm not a
1078.86s: Perma bull I will go to cash
1082.04s: but I understand there's bad periods and
1085.40s: Bill Bill said look in a downtrend you
1087.98s: have to go to cash but he never really
1089.90s: explained about the magnitude of how
1091.82s: long Bears can be and how brutal they
1093.74s: can be and if you're not careful how
1095.72s: much you can lose
1097.76s: um he said look just color your lessons
1099.50s: seven percent and walk away and he
1100.88s: didn't really go into the pain you're
1102.68s: going to endure even the greats if you
1105.68s: if you if you persist in this endeavor
1108.74s: um there's a oh God
1110.78s: you know I could go through my thing and
1112.34s: find some gym rules for you I I have I
1114.56s: have 65 Bill rules bills golden rules
1116.74s: since Bill's no longer with us I now
1118.82s: have the gym rules which are probably
1120.08s: nowhere near as valuable as the bill
1121.52s: rules but I'll maybe I'll look some up
1123.26s: will you ask me another question how
1124.52s: about that yeah yeah I definitely want
1126.38s: to hear more about the the generals so
1128.36s: yeah when I think about a lot of what
1130.82s: Bill taught me it definitely was looking
1134.30s: for strength it's not really accepting
1136.88s: anything less and one of the things that
1139.64s: he really encouraged me to adopt is a
1142.70s: different psychology when it came to
1144.44s: specifically for bullish plays but when
1146.48s: I'm looking for bullish plays I'm
1147.98s: looking for reasons to say no and as
1150.26s: soon as I see one then that's the reason
1151.88s: it's time to move on to something else
1153.20s: whereas I feel like a lot of retail
1154.82s: Traders it's the inverse where they're
1157.28s: trying to convince themselves to say yes
1160.10s: so when you're you're hitting a home run
1163.40s: here okay there's 55 Public 5500 public
1167.18s: companies I am distilling that down
1171.20s: to like four
1173.48s: I am so selective Beyond
1176.20s: incredible selectivity I am looking for
1179.24s: excellence across the board in all all
1181.70s: metrics
1183.32s: um I won't put a trade on
1186.38s: unless I feel I am being forced to buy
1190.16s: or forced to sell I don't ever
1192.62s: anticipate I
1195.02s: over after cutting losses which is the
1197.54s: rookie mistake of rookie mistakes not
1199.46s: cutting losses the second biggest rookie
1201.62s: mistake is over trading and I over trade
1204.14s: Like A Champion I was a rock star at it
1206.36s: buddy every trade used to get a
1208.40s: confirmation in the mail and it was like
1210.50s: a blizzard flew into my house when the
1212.78s: mail guy showed up anyway
1214.64s: I
1216.08s: need the market to force me into it
1218.96s: and I the the more I trade the more I
1221.72s: lose
1222.68s: the more I get emotionally caught up in
1225.62s: things I'm no longer trying to pull the
1227.84s: arm on the slot machine I am not trading
1230.96s: the less I trade the better I do the
1233.96s: more patient I be patients emotional
1236.48s: control discipline long durations
1239.06s: outlooks look 20 years down the road in
1241.58s: I'm going to be doing this for 20 years
1242.96s: or more these are all the reason people
1244.94s: fail is all those reasons right there
1246.62s: man
1248.18s: um so do we have some some gym rules yes
1252.56s: perfect
1254.18s: um
1255.86s: false narratives are so abundant but the
1259.16s: markets are lie detectors and ferret out
1261.56s: the truth price does not lie or it can't
1264.26s: lie for very long think about the
1266.84s: invasion of Ukraine expectations where
1269.06s: food and energy shortages like they were
1271.10s: talking about in Germany they were going
1272.90s: to freeze to death in the winter yes and
1274.40s: there was going to be you know the price
1275.72s: of wheat was going to go to 50 million
1277.34s: dollars a bushel price of wheat went
1279.08s: down and no one froze in Germany okay
1283.04s: um I mean I I can go on and on and on
1284.96s: about just false narratives you have to
1288.68s: remove your personal bias
1291.56s: and forget the news and follow the price
1294.02s: but you can get really scared by there's
1296.48s: going to be starvation like literally
1298.16s: you're talking about wheat prices
1299.42s: Russia's I'm sorry Ukraine's the fourth
1301.82s: largest wheat producer in the world and
1303.56s: and you know that's what a lot of people
1304.70s: like sit they live on didn't happen
1307.88s: um
1308.54s: let's see here I can uh
1314.66s: you know the greatest Trader in my view
1317.72s: is Stan druckenmiller yeah he makes
1320.84s: mistakes he in 2020 got it wrong and he
1325.88s: didn't make money
1327.02s: um oh God I you know what
1332.96s: you look I hear something Bill didn't
1335.48s: really talk about this as much as I
1338.06s: thought but the average true market
1339.80s: leader goes up about 90 94 to 98 weeks
1343.34s: it's a it's four to six beat and raise
1346.40s: quarters the def my definition of a true
1349.64s: market leader
1350.90s: is four to six beat and raise quarters
1353.66s: if you can get in a stack in the right
1355.76s: size and sit
1358.16s: you that that's how you're going to make
1360.08s: an absolute killing and the the stocks
1362.30s: that I've made the most money in were
1364.04s: all through beat and raise quarters it
1365.72s: was Bill stressed
1368.42s: earnings and earnings growth but he
1370.94s: rarely talked about beat and raise the
1374.54s: the reason stocks move is because
1377.60s: there's an earnings report they beat now
1380.00s: the analysts have got to raise guidance
1382.04s: you know the estimates were a dollar
1383.96s: they blow it away then next year they
1386.84s: had it for two dollars well they gotta
1387.86s: raise it to three now that new
1388.82s: information's got to be discounted into
1390.08s: the price and up goes the price that's
1392.54s: how you get beat and raise or I'm sorry
1394.64s: that's you get prices to move the new
1396.50s: information now has to be factored
1398.78s: forward
1400.16s: um
1400.76s: uh you know Bill never talked about
1402.86s: volatility contractions like the Bitcoin
1406.46s: market right now is dead the volume is
1409.88s: dead
1410.72s: no one cares AI has stolen bitcoin's
1413.78s: Thunder the story of Bitcoin is only
1417.08s: become richer
1418.88s: and the contraction and volatility we're
1420.92s: at some of the lowest levels of Bitcoin
1422.96s: volatility in history
1424.58s: along with whale accumulation but anyway
1427.88s: dude I don't I'd have to really sort
1430.22s: these out because there's so many of
1431.66s: them and I don't want to waste your time
1433.16s: while I read looking for them honestly I
1436.16s: like those ones that you shared anyways
1437.96s: but oh bill was a very heavy bill was a
1441.02s: very heavy user of margin which he
1443.42s: talked about but he didn't talk enough
1446.60s: about it he he didn't talk enough about
1448.70s: money management either he would say oh
1451.04s: you have an account with uh 100 grand
1453.14s: should buy four stocks like he didn't he
1455.24s: said his money management was
1458.48s: you really should have known more than
1459.86s: seven or eight stocks like he didn't
1462.20s: go into that enough
1464.18s: um
1469.66s: man I I do know how about I'll send you
1472.94s: a couple of them you can post it up on
1474.50s: your website or whatever yeah I love
1476.30s: that yeah well and you actually just hit
1478.94s: another thing I wanted to ask you about
1480.14s: which is you know
1482.48s: exactly the way that you think about
1484.40s: managing your book because to your point
1487.10s: if you want to catch these big runs you
1489.62s: can't be too spread out right if you
1491.60s: have a little bit in a ton of different
1492.98s: things you get a giant move doesn't
1494.30s: really matter but if you're too
1496.58s: centralized then obviously that presents
1498.86s: its own issues so how do you find that
1500.36s: balance
1502.34s: this is an unbelievably good question
1505.04s: because in markets like we're in right
1506.96s: now
1507.80s: size kills
1509.60s: size kills size kills in many ways
1513.26s: most great money managers attract so
1516.20s: much money that their performance is
1518.12s: diluted it's like putting cinder blocks
1520.22s: on an Olympic Athlete he is an Olympic
1522.02s: Athlete but you wait a professional
1524.00s: money manager down with too much it you
1526.64s: know I think can Slim
1528.44s: in a large scale
1530.96s: is difficult to run over 100 or 200
1534.02s: million dollars there's not enough
1535.52s: liquidity in today's market due to the
1538.16s: amount of takeovers and mergers and
1539.66s: BuyBacks the supply stock has shrunk so
1541.76s: liquidity is gone and you took out the
1543.86s: the Specialists and the market makers
1545.36s: and now it's run by Algos there's not
1547.28s: enough liquidity like you being in the
1549.38s: Futures Market you could scale Futures
1551.12s: accounts into the billions you really
1553.16s: could so
1554.60s: um what was the question again well
1556.40s: quick caveat there everybody Eric is not
1558.80s: scaling any of the billions just
1560.30s: throwing it out there but not yet not
1562.64s: yet
1565.22s: um no I was asking essentially how you
1567.26s: find the the balance between having too
1570.02s: big of a book where if you get your move
1571.88s: it doesn't really matter versus having
1574.10s: too small of a book where you can get
1576.50s: ran over if you're wrong
1578.36s: I just think
1580.04s: bills stated method
1583.34s: is very difficult for most people to
1585.32s: implement because
1587.24s: price will hurt you but size will kill
1591.32s: you and Bill stresses concentration
1596.00s: but I literally will trade
1598.76s: 100 Lots in testing a new bull trend
1603.32s: and I'll trade 400 000 shares in Bull
1605.96s: markets in one stock depending on the
1608.18s: price
1609.02s: I mean you know I'm looking to put five
1610.94s: to ten million in each position
1613.64s: so I'll just tell you sorry I thought
1615.26s: there was a computer system that was
1617.06s: used on the Chicago Stock Exchange many
1618.56s: many many years back and this guy was
1620.00s: the biggest Trader on the floor in
1621.38s: Chicago he lived Three Doors Down for me
1623.66s: I told him I had 27 000 shares of siebel
1627.08s: systems in my personal account
1628.88s: and he looks at me and that's just a
1630.38s: long time ago he goes son he goes I
1632.96s: don't know how much money you have he
1634.34s: goes but that sounds like an awful lot
1635.66s: of stock and he goes I'll just tell you
1637.04s: price will hurt you but size will kill
1639.38s: you and he was right and I got stopped
1642.20s: out of my whole position and lost money
1644.06s: on a stock that went up like 800 percent
1646.82s: and then I did it again in a stock
1648.92s: called theragenics it took a lot of me
1651.38s: touching that hot burner to learn this
1652.88s: lesson on the other side of things I
1655.70s: think if you get more than 12 stocks or
1657.56s: something around that position you
1660.08s: become the index
1662.06s: so you it's hard to beat the index when
1664.58s: you almost are the index if you want to
1667.28s: have outsized gains you need to really
1670.84s: concentrate that down to still into
1673.16s: those big leaders but now your
1675.50s: volatility is going to go way up
1677.72s: okay so Bill didn't Bill traded around
1682.10s: his positions a little bit
1684.14s: but he didn't hedge
1686.24s: and I do when a stock gets extended the
1689.78s: bill never really talked about this very
1691.52s: often
1692.42s: you need to understand the personality
1694.64s: of a stack and if its personality is at
1697.34s: 20 or 30 over the 50 day it pulls back
1699.56s: to the 50-day you better start hedging
1701.36s: because if you have quarter your whole
1702.92s: account in a stack and it goes down 30
1704.42s: and it only goes to a normal place which
1707.06s: is perfectly healthy can you take that
1709.22s: draw down now throw Mark throw a margin
1711.44s: on there and let's assume that your
1713.00s: other stocks are going to pull back the
1714.32s: exact same time because the general
1715.46s: Market's probably going to be in a
1716.96s: digestion Bill didn't explain volatility
1720.02s: and look bill made me all right my three
1723.50s: hedge funds my net worth is predicated
1726.20s: on Bill Bill speaking directly to me
1728.72s: paying attention to me Me Knocking him
1731.06s: off I'm not knocking Bill I'm just
1733.52s: saying he should have told me the pain I
1735.14s: was going to go through to get here yeah
1737.66s: definitely well and still to your point
1739.58s: I I find the same thing like
1741.82s: I am woefully unoriginal myself and a
1745.76s: lot of what I did was predicated
1747.02s: actually on a like a mentor I found
1749.06s: online so it sounds like the start of a
1751.22s: child predator scheme but it's not it
1753.56s: was a great he was an Army dude that was
1755.60s: just helping me out um but he was an
1757.34s: options Trader but it's the same exact
1758.90s: thing where I feel like there's things
1761.24s: that I've learned on my own that I've
1763.70s: been able to apply and kind of adapt and
1765.74s: it sounds like that's what I took from
1767.30s: what you were saying is that you still
1768.98s: are an autonomous thinking human being
1770.42s: digesting information and integrating
1772.40s: that into your process when you look at
1775.88s: these stocks and they're starting to run
1777.68s: up 20 30 above the 50-day moving
1779.72s: averages
1780.74s: how are you looking to hedge them are
1782.42s: you taking size off or are you using
1783.98s: options are you putting on counter
1786.50s: opposing trades what's the Hedge I don't
1789.32s: like to pay taxes fifty percent of the
1791.84s: money goes to the government you mean
1793.70s: talk about compounding with your all
1795.62s: your money or knock that down to
1797.12s: long-term gains at 20 so I don't want to
1799.94s: dislodge my stock especially my low-cost
1802.70s: stock so I'm going to be selling in the
1804.98s: money calls
1807.08s: um and and then is this if if I'm right
1809.06s: in the stock come oh by the way I don't
1811.10s: ever want to hedge my whole position
1812.72s: because what if it blows off all right
1815.06s: I'm gonna hedge I used to hedge like 20
1817.40s: and I realized that's nowhere near
1818.72s: enough to dampen the effect of the
1820.16s: pullback so I'm generally going to hedge
1822.50s: 30 to 50 percent of my long position
1824.24s: within the money calls that way the
1827.72s: volatility
1828.92s: and uh the premium is going to time and
1831.44s: volatility premium works for me it
1833.12s: erodes so I have that going for me it's
1835.40s: in the money it's generally I try to you
1838.10s: know like 80 Delta calls in the money
1840.86s: shorting super deep yeah now the
1843.56s: spread's big
1845.12s: but how else are you going to keep your
1847.16s: stock and head yourself down 10 15 or
1850.10s: more ten percent five ten percent so
1852.80s: that simply I sell calls and I will trim
1855.56s: off stock like this correction we're in
1858.32s: right now was far greater than a garden
1860.90s: variety pull back in a in a bull market
1863.24s: there's a lot going on we can discuss
1865.28s: that at the end
1866.96s: yeah yeah well it is and that's another
1869.36s: thing I I did want to start getting your
1871.16s: take on anyways but before then um there
1873.92s: was a couple questions I had from some
1875.48s: of my community for you one of which is
1879.92s: um when you're looking at the various
1881.60s: can slim factors how do you weight them
1885.14s: are there some that you personally apply
1887.90s: heavier weight than others that kind of
1889.52s: thing
1892.70s: before I tell you this you're talking
1895.16s: about the fundamental metrics
1898.04s: I am a fundamentalist I am a story I
1901.28s: understand Celsius case growth unit
1903.80s: growth total addressable Market
1906.62s: more than I do
1908.72s: but once I have the story down
1912.14s: I'll just State this I probably made
1913.46s: about 90 of my net worth and about eight
1915.98s: stocks in 35 in 30 35 years
1921.14s: I understood the fundamentals intimately
1923.96s: in every one of them like I really
1926.06s: really deeply understood what was going
1927.68s: on
1928.52s: but as soon as I get that clear let's
1931.16s: just take that off the table
1933.08s: relative strength group strength
1936.52s: General trend of the trend of the
1939.08s: General market but relative strength is
1940.76s: going to take you right to the best
1943.52s: names in the whole Market anybody
1945.20s: looking at stocks it's like here
1947.78s: forget there's no money involved you can
1950.48s: pick for free a Vega or a Hugo or a
1954.08s: Lambo or a Ferrari what are you going to
1955.70s: take I'm always going to go to the high
1957.68s: relative strength Ferraris I'm not I
1959.30s: don't want to let you go I don't want a
1961.04s: Volkswagen
1962.48s: um relative strength it's like a
1964.16s: divining Rod right to the to the water
1966.08s: with all the money in it
1968.00s: um
1968.96s: group strength up to down volume is
1972.20s: wildly under misunderstood or
1974.26s: underutilized uh accumulation
1977.06s: distribution earnings growth and
1978.86s: earnings beat
1980.90s: that is it's just like why would a stock
1983.54s: go up if it wasn't expecting earnings
1986.00s: growth and earnings beat it's like I
1988.28s: call it the Cockroach theory if you're
1990.14s: going to look in an apartment and a
1991.46s: cockroach comes out from the floor
1993.74s: rest assured there's 10 more under the
1995.48s: counter
1996.38s: earnings Beats
1998.18s: are not one-off occurrences they are
2000.16s: usually serial earnings beats and repeat
2003.40s: now you can not lean into that too much
2006.88s: they have to materialize but when you
2009.64s: have an earnings beat because of some
2010.84s: new product what do you think people are
2012.46s: just going to run to the shelves and
2013.54s: clear them off for one quarter and then
2015.10s: they're never going back again no people
2017.32s: are going to tell other people that's
2018.40s: going to be a you know an 18-month story
2020.80s: at least
2022.48s: so there's relative strength up to down
2025.24s: volume group strength
2028.36s: um tight okay now I'm going to go into
2029.98s: technical
2031.18s: talk to me weekly closes in the chart
2034.12s: pattern
2035.14s: is prevalent in nearly every I didn't
2038.68s: use every I said nearly I don't paint
2041.26s: myself into a corner like a marine who's
2042.76s: about to get killed
2044.26s: um they're just if you look at
2046.30s: historical charts of the biggest winners
2048.58s: in history
2050.26s: they have tight areas from two to five
2052.60s: weeks and
2054.40s: um Baker Hughes right now just came out
2057.70s: of and came back it broke out of about a
2059.50s: five weeks tight area now what's the
2061.96s: ticket for them
2062.98s: say that again be our kicker for them
2065.52s: bkr on a weekly
2068.32s: yeah I'll grab it and then we can take a
2069.82s: quick look
2074.64s: if you want I can share my
2077.56s: I got it and you said you want to use a
2079.96s: weekly chart yes sir
2082.18s: three years five years what tickles your
2084.28s: fancy oh that's perfect right there
2086.50s: look look at your red key um go back
2088.96s: five six eight weeks and it starts the
2091.06s: first red week there's two red weeks go
2093.28s: to the right
2094.72s: go right right right up in the handle
2096.70s: keep going I'm on there right there boom
2099.64s: look at those tight closes one two three
2102.40s: four is it four or five
2104.44s: it would be better on a bar chart and I
2106.36s: don't want to waste your time go into it
2107.86s: five weeks in a row you know
2111.94s: yeah it's five
2113.68s: yeah and the group is number the group
2116.44s: strength is like you know out of 200
2118.60s: it's like three out of 200. it's it's
2120.64s: almost it's elite
2123.16s: Elite group oils on a run
2126.94s: um I I my fun does have a position I've
2129.46s: been reducing it
2131.26s: um my lawyers love me that I just told
2132.76s: you that
2134.76s: you got to give them work you got to
2137.08s: give them a job
2138.46s: look they can make their money on
2139.96s: billing somebody else for a freaking
2141.34s: lawsuit I don't need one
2143.08s: um
2143.80s: anyway tight closes are eight
2147.76s: the can slim is predicated on a detailed
2151.54s: study of the biggest winning stocks in
2153.28s: history and what characteristics did
2154.96s: they possess
2156.22s: and it's all in Bill's book can slim
2158.62s: it's all there now the one thing is a
2161.86s: gentleman I know Amira Kroll found that
2164.50s: something like 30 or 40 percent of all
2167.08s: big winning stocks have no earnings
2170.08s: which is contrary to canned Slim the
2173.32s: difference is that when you have no
2175.24s: earnings and you get into a bad Market
2176.80s: or a bear Market those stocks get
2178.72s: pummeled more right earnings bring
2181.42s: durability
2182.74s: and earnings bring institutions and once
2185.92s: there are no institutions in your stock
2187.66s: could because there's no earnings and
2189.58s: somebody goes in to dump 400 000 shares
2191.56s: who's there to buy it
2194.32s: if you know Fidelity says I'm bid for
2197.56s: five million shares literally
2200.02s: they're there to absorb your shares but
2202.48s: when you're looking at some market cap
2204.76s: stock at three billion dollars and
2206.98s: somebody wants to dump 300 300 million
2208.72s: thousand shares there's no institutions
2210.58s: in there earnings bring institutions
2212.08s: earnings bring liquidity
2214.78s: so there's a bunch
2216.70s: yeah well and it makes a ton of sense
2218.92s: too because I think I mean you can look
2222.64s: at you know
2225.04s: aggregate numbers of performance but
2227.62s: then I think there's you have to you
2229.66s: know an interesting follow-on study that
2231.40s: comes to my mind for that is what's the
2232.90s: probabilistic outcomes out of the total
2234.64s: pool right because my guess is
2237.66s: probabilistically there's likely a
2239.56s: higher percentage that have earnings
2241.12s: versus not but you might have a large
2243.76s: raw number with earnings that would be
2245.80s: my yes look it's much easier for me to
2251.74s: sit when I know there's earnings
2254.44s: all right
2256.06s: um you know biotech I've been
2258.40s: obliterated in biotech and I've made a
2260.26s: fortune in biotech in a few other
2262.12s: differences but
2265.18s: most biotech companies are Research
2267.46s: Laboratories with no sales force they're
2269.92s: they're not even a product they're
2271.84s: working on a product and if you go
2274.30s: through clinical trials and they don't
2276.34s: pass the FDA approval goes to zero
2280.00s: basically almost goes to zero now once
2283.60s: you have an FDA approval and then sales
2287.20s: occur the amgen's first reported
2291.28s: earnings second reported earnings four
2293.92s: quarters forward work 32 cents against a
2297.22s: penny
2299.74s: that's when they invented epigen okay
2303.16s: that was the beginning of the move where
2306.34s: the stock went to Mars it basically
2308.50s: changed the world of medicine if you had
2311.26s: AIDS or you were going through chemo
2312.94s: your red blood cells were being run down
2314.98s: you just they injected you with this
2316.60s: stuff and it ramped your red blood cells
2318.34s: so you could take more chemo live longer
2320.68s: with AIDS it was a game changer and then
2323.56s: they came up with neupogen which is a
2325.78s: white blood cell replenisher it changed
2327.64s: medicine
2328.48s: that was not going to be a one-quarter
2331.18s: earnings beat and that stack went to
2332.86s: Mars versus some company that has no
2335.20s: earnings whatsoever it's just like sales
2336.76s: growth I have a rule Jim rule that I
2340.54s: won't put more than one or two pers um
2342.64s: stocks in my whole portfolio into
2344.32s: earning no earnings growth stocks when
2347.32s: the market is being led or augmented
2349.72s: greatly by stocks they have no earnings
2351.70s: growth you're getting to a frothy Market
2354.28s: when you get a lot of IPOs that have no
2356.98s: earnings you're late in the game the
2359.26s: IPOs that are coming out now have
2361.42s: earnings okay they are
2363.64s: another rule this is you know it's a
2365.98s: rule
2367.36s: when the IPO window is closed the first
2371.14s: deals to come out are Elite
2374.38s: Elite the best names to in a bear Market
2378.34s: or after a bear Market to get an
2380.08s: institution to come up Pony up cash
2382.54s: they're only going to do that for the
2383.80s: greatest stock in the world they're not
2384.94s: going to do it on a maybe they're
2386.44s: gunshot they've been beaten up so the
2388.84s: best name you IPOs and bear markets are
2391.00s: the end of bears or new Bulls those are
2393.94s: good probabilities of being
2397.14s: tmls again I don't like IPOs 95 or seven
2401.50s: percent of all IPOs undercut their IPO
2405.72s: opening trading day close within a year
2408.76s: or two the odds are terrible most of
2410.50s: them are small ill liquid speculative
2412.24s: I'm looking for more durable quality
2416.44s: you asked me variables I'm backtracking
2418.66s: the comp rating
2420.76s: the copy rating is there for a reason if
2423.28s: you're buying a stock that is a copy
2424.66s: rating below 90 there's something wrong
2426.58s: with your stock it's not Elite
2430.42s: it's when you were talking about the the
2432.94s: biotechs I really resonated with that
2435.28s: because in trading volatility with
2438.22s: options that's spent a lot of time there
2440.20s: we call it it's kind of like the sewers
2442.12s: it's where things are not liquid there's
2444.34s: a lot of volatility and literally the
2447.10s: way I've learned to hedge out risk in
2450.28s: those kinds of Trades is to just have a
2453.52s: large number of occurrences literally to
2455.50s: have a large sample size because
2457.36s: sometimes even when you're trying to
2458.98s: find the door it's not there
2461.20s: because there's no damn liquidity so the
2463.84s: the biotech thought process you went
2466.66s: down again also very much resonated with
2469.12s: me I've spent a lot of time but you
2471.16s: learn a lot of super cool things that's
2473.26s: the fun part there I think
2475.06s: you know being in the markets my
2477.04s: daughter
2477.88s: any daughter looks up their dad and
2480.10s: overstates the grandiose grandiosity of
2482.44s: the of the father but my daughter's like
2484.18s: Dave you you just I ask you a question
2485.62s: she's like you know the answer to all
2486.88s: this stuff I'm like no Sarah my daughter
2488.50s: Sarah I go I've been in the markets for
2490.60s: a million years I've been in a trucking
2492.76s: stock I've been in a biotech stock I've
2494.20s: been in a plastic stock I know I know
2496.12s: this much about everything but not
2498.34s: enough to be valuable so being in the
2500.80s: markets is the most enlightening
2502.90s: I I wonder
2505.06s: after understanding economics like I'm
2508.18s: incompetent to work at the Federal
2509.44s: Reserve I'm not an economist I'm not
2511.48s: that smart but I understand economics
2514.18s: enough to know a lot about the world and
2516.88s: how the world works and I look at people
2519.58s: in Congress
2521.20s: and I'm like they are incompetent they
2524.14s: are incompetent to do their jobs the
2527.14s: president
2528.10s: maybe Ronald Reagan was not competent to
2530.86s: be the drug czar the housings are the
2533.80s: leader of the military and all the other
2536.08s: branches but he brought in experts from
2538.72s: that industry that were
2541.24s: in that industry for many years and were
2543.10s: top dogs in that industry
2545.92s: if you if your presidential cabinet is
2548.92s: not loaded with people from industry you
2552.16s: appoint them because of their clout or
2554.86s: their donations
2557.02s: you're a charlatan you're a schmuck it
2560.50s: it it it you're it's detrimental that is
2563.08s: it ah tangent man well it's it's
2566.92s: fascinating because I find markets in
2569.50s: general find people that can balance
2572.10s: Theory and practical application which
2574.90s: literally transitions over from exactly
2576.76s: what you were just talking about is this
2579.10s: idea of meeting people with some level
2581.38s: of experience in both when you look at
2585.58s: your day-to-day you know habits how much
2589.12s: of it are you leaning on the theory of
2591.10s: what you've learned versus the practical
2593.68s: application of the skill set because I
2595.54s: know for me I spent a lot of time in
2597.76s: theory up front understanding again how
2599.86s: derivatives work all the different
2601.36s: details because they're very nuanced
2602.86s: products but then after a while you kind
2605.02s: of just have a feel for them and I think
2607.54s: the feel quote unquote is a lot of
2609.94s: subconscious processing that just is
2612.94s: happening in the background from that
2614.14s: learned experience but on a day-to-day I
2616.48s: have my things I look for but a lot of
2618.28s: times I can do a cursory overview and
2620.20s: have a good quote-unquote feel to
2622.00s: whether or not this is the right place
2623.20s: for me to be do you find the same when
2625.18s: you're looking for your stocks or is
2626.62s: each and every one a very rigorous
2628.36s: process
2631.06s: I find that finding stocks is Easy by
2633.82s: screening it's just second nature to me
2636.34s: the real battle is when the Market's
2640.18s: open and you're being fired at and your
2642.16s: emotions are running High
2643.72s: but I'm automatic I have my stop losses
2645.76s: I know exactly where they are I know
2647.44s: from history when it breaks the 50 down
2649.72s: volume I I'm watching the Val I know
2651.46s: exactly what to look for but when the
2653.86s: Market's turning up
2655.84s: I have my ropal report I have my battle
2658.18s: plan you know I'm I'm in the turret I'm
2660.88s: ready to go I have the plane it's right
2662.62s: in front of me
2663.70s: so I don't have to I will run screens in
2666.58s: the day for Price up on volume
2669.64s: but I already know what those names are
2671.92s: because I did all my research on Sunday
2674.98s: um
2676.68s: It's a combination like there's um
2679.66s: another uh quote it says education is
2682.84s: pretty thin stuff without experience
2685.60s: and I'll say something else you can talk
2687.58s: a lot and write a beautiful newsletter
2691.66s: but implementing a whole nother world
2694.90s: ninety percent of the game is
2696.40s: implementation it's kind of like what
2698.14s: did Tyson say everyone's got a plan
2699.40s: until you get punch in the face and the
2701.68s: market is going to punch you in the face
2703.48s: a lot
2705.34s: um so it's a combination of both it's
2707.14s: both it's it's experience
2709.96s: it's really disciplined to implement
2711.88s: your plan whether it's can slim or value
2715.30s: or GARP or whatever the heck you're
2717.82s: doing it's discipline to not be led by
2720.76s: your emotions or scared by your emotions
2722.98s: or become greedy because of your
2724.60s: emotions like I said the book you have
2727.24s: options for a Strategic investment
2728.74s: behind your green and white book okay I
2730.78s: read the book a million years ago
2733.24s: anyone can read that book and probably
2735.04s: make money if they implement the process
2739.54s: yeah I think it's totally fair
2742.48s: I think one of the things that would
2746.38s: help people now is there's unlimited
2749.32s: information out there and I think that
2751.30s: people find themselves in just analysis
2753.22s: paralysis information overload you can
2755.20s: get to just this nintenoid level of
2757.18s: detail with everything but you found a
2760.48s: pretty efficient way to just generally
2762.58s: call you know a large sample or a large
2766.84s: population into a small sample right you
2769.24s: have like your criteria that you're
2770.44s: looking for if somebody wants to get
2773.44s: more efficient at scanning the market
2775.36s: specifically for can slim style stocks
2777.88s: because that's your area of expertise
2779.38s: what are some of the introductory scans
2782.68s: you think they could start looking at on
2784.54s: a daily basis you mentioned price by
2786.10s: volume I'm curious if there's a couple
2788.02s: others not necessarily for them to go
2790.12s: start slinging trades but to develop
2792.76s: pattern recognition to develop an
2794.86s: understanding of what things pop up in
2796.84s: this pool and what they generally look
2798.22s: like
2801.82s: minimum liquidity is an absolute must
2804.82s: and I use about 100 million average
2807.94s: daily dollar volume
2809.74s: below there is kind of below 30 a share
2812.86s: below 100 million dollars dollar volume
2814.96s: is getting into the junk Heap
2818.14s: let's go below 50 million average daily
2820.30s: dollar volume RS
2822.22s: above 80 85. I don't even look at things
2825.40s: below 90. in my newsletter I almost
2828.28s: don't cover stocks with RS below 90.
2830.80s: comp rating
2833.44s: um EPS in the 80s and 90s at least you
2838.00s: know I'm looking for a 99
2840.52s: um
2842.86s: dude you could anybody can learn to scan
2845.38s: with Market Smith
2846.84s: in about a month
2850.36s: when you generate those names how do you
2853.18s: handle them when you have a big position
2854.68s: on and the Market's pulling back because
2857.02s: uh you know India threatened a new
2860.26s: Pakistan overnight or uh there was a
2862.36s: skirmish in the South China Sea and the
2864.76s: Chinese shot down over Fighters and the
2866.74s: market gap down thousand points on the
2868.36s: open and you're long on margin what do
2870.28s: you do do you know what to do have you
2872.56s: done it before do you have your do you
2874.60s: have your stops all in place will you
2876.10s: pull the trigger or will you go I know
2878.08s: it's not going to be that big of a deal
2879.28s: and then it goes down another thousand
2880.48s: points the next day
2882.34s: I mean the scanning and finding those
2885.40s: stocks is the easy part that's you're
2888.76s: not even you're walking out of the
2890.38s: Dugout in the first inning to hit to
2892.78s: take your first swing that's not even
2894.58s: swinging at the ball that's just
2896.32s: figuring out what equipment you're going
2897.82s: to use in The Dugout where's your what's
2899.20s: your batting helmet what bad are you
2900.52s: going to use now you get up to the plate
2902.62s: the guy throw will give you the chin
2904.12s: music you know I mean you swing outside
2906.34s: the box ex implementation is process
2911.32s: and emotional control is everything I'm
2914.56s: I am you have to learn how to screen and
2917.26s: know what criteria you're looking for
2918.52s: but anybody can tighten up those
2920.80s: variables to where you're only
2922.18s: generating 15 or 20 names
2924.82s: now once you have that now what you're
2926.68s: going to buy it extended you're going to
2927.88s: buy it in the bottom of a base or you're
2929.86s: only going to buy it on a breakout when
2931.18s: volume comes in
2933.16s: implementation
2936.16s: one of the things you mentioned I forgot
2938.56s: what podcast it was on but it was
2940.30s: actually really insightful for me when
2942.64s: you were talking about kind of this idea
2944.98s: of like a true market leader versus like
2947.26s: the second and third place and how the
2949.18s: difference in performance for the true
2951.22s: market leader can be up 300 percent and
2954.22s: the second place guy can be like 150
2956.80s: percent like that's a massive difference
2959.20s: between first and second place how do
2961.18s: you find first place
2964.68s: screening for it is large the metrics
2967.72s: like if one has return on Equity that's
2969.46s: twice as good as the other one
2971.80s: little Details Matter
2974.38s: a horse that wins it at the racetrack
2976.30s: wins by a nose but pays 20x what the
2979.60s: second place horse pays I did a study
2982.96s: from roughly 1950 call it to 2010-ish
2988.30s: of every group
2989.98s: the top five leaders in the group the
2991.96s: percentage gains and the difference
2993.46s: between first and second and the
2995.14s: difference between the performance of
2996.40s: one and two was one hundred percent
2999.16s: how do you know you screen for the
3001.26s: metrics but then the fundamental story
3002.82s: which one is taking over the market okay
3007.74s: monster which very few people know was
3010.50s: one of the very best acts ever in
3012.36s: history
3013.50s: Celsius is now eating their Market
3016.04s: knowing the story at Celsius is really
3019.62s: important now What's the total
3021.84s: addressable Market
3023.52s: what which company has the variables
3026.16s: that are slightly better than the other
3028.74s: the product I mean bill would say to me
3030.54s: here's I'll give you Bill gold I'd ask
3032.88s: Bill a lot should I sit through earnings
3035.34s: and you'd be like have you been to the
3036.78s: store have you used the product have you
3038.76s: been to Starbucks do you have confidence
3040.92s: in it personally do you count the cars
3042.48s: in the parking lot using the product
3044.70s: having actual Hands-On knowledge what's
3047.70s: your level of confidence
3049.38s: you know you know what kind of how much
3051.36s: cushion do you have for the year is the
3053.46s: market in a solid bull Trend a
3055.26s: wishy-washy bull Trend or a bear Market
3057.78s: what's the environment you know it's
3059.40s: like are we in an irrational exuberance
3062.46s: Market Alan Greenspan or are we in a
3064.80s: full-blown bear where they're pumping
3065.94s: liquidity and because things are going
3067.02s: cow
3068.34s: these are all reasons why you would hold
3070.26s: through earnings
3071.94s: um
3072.66s: you have to assume every earnings report
3075.30s: you could have a miss and it's going to
3076.92s: gap down by over 20 percent
3079.44s: if you cannot tolerate that you cannot
3082.44s: be in stock
3083.64s: or you have to hedge now hedging into
3086.28s: earnings is different than her hedging
3088.08s: into a pullback because I would probably
3090.24s: rather buy puts or do a put spread
3092.22s: because I don't want to give away the
3093.84s: upside if I'm in that stock through
3095.16s: earnings I think it's going to beat and
3096.48s: I don't want to give up my upside so I'm
3098.22s: willing to pay The Vig
3100.62s: um but I'll actually probably sell the
3102.66s: the put a good bit lower because I don't
3104.88s: want to pay all the vague right right
3107.04s: right yeah but by the point I want to
3109.44s: buy the
3110.34s: slightly below the money put closer to
3112.26s: the money and sell the further yes
3114.12s: because I just dude
3116.70s: you know this your futures dude
3119.04s: What four out of five options or eight
3121.38s: and a half out of ten go worthless
3124.02s: it's actually much lower than that
3125.76s: that's like a really quiet yeah it's a
3129.30s: really really miss common quoted
3130.86s: statistic but
3132.54s: um the vast majority are actually closed
3134.88s: before expiration so it's like 60 plus
3137.40s: are exited before expiration and then
3140.28s: nine out of ten held by retail go to
3143.04s: zero well that that I think is pretty
3146.58s: pretty solid bet anything uh anything
3150.24s: retails by and I think you can take a
3152.46s: pretty good guess on that
3155.28s: um
3155.94s: another thing I wanted to ask you which
3158.16s: you started talking about but this is
3159.66s: another question for my audience which
3161.82s: is one of the things I talk a lot about
3163.56s: is if people are looking to trade
3165.54s: directionally whether it's bullish or
3166.98s: bearish to look for the corresponding
3169.14s: sectors that are performing that way and
3171.54s: then start narrowing down within those
3172.98s: sectors just trying to stack as many
3174.84s: things in favor of your thesis
3177.12s: how do you go about identifying just
3180.48s: Market breadth and then what sectors you
3184.20s: view are
3186.00s: strong performing versus weak performers
3188.28s: all right net new highs
3190.20s: net new highs the reason I never called
3193.14s: this a bull market I called it at best a
3196.14s: transitional bull when the market
3197.82s: started to go up in January February
3199.62s: this year
3200.64s: the new highs never confirmed almost
3203.04s: every most days throughout the year we
3205.20s: had negative net we had negative we had
3208.02s: net negative new lows over highs we
3211.80s: never got into bull confirmed status we
3213.48s: had brief periods where they would new
3215.94s: highs would ellipse new lows but not
3218.76s: only that the new lows right now are
3221.58s: getting into dangerous territory it's
3223.38s: we're not in
3225.18s: every bull market has pullbacks and net
3227.88s: new lows exceed new Highs but they're
3229.44s: marginal
3230.46s: 40 new homes a day 100 new lows a day 50
3233.70s: new lows we're running big numbers here
3236.46s: we're not in
3237.96s: a bull market pullback according to new
3240.18s: highs new lows and the bull market never
3241.92s: transitioned from a bear to a bull
3244.32s: right there now that's one thing you
3246.00s: asked me to qualify what was the other
3247.20s: one on breath you said breath and what
3249.06s: was it yeah breath was the first one and
3250.74s: then the other is just analyzing sectors
3252.78s: to find what sectors you like to the
3254.64s: upside to the downside I screen for
3256.98s: everything so I'm generally gonna all of
3260.16s: a sudden start to come up with
3262.14s: um diverging RS or RS leading RS I
3265.92s: screen for that all the time leading IRS
3268.14s: in a bear in a pullback
3270.00s: is gold it's pointing you right to what
3272.28s: the market loves
3273.60s: so leading IRS is a great screen but
3276.42s: when you start running screens like that
3278.40s: or up to down volume over say 1.5
3281.52s: it's going to point you right to the
3282.72s: leaders and also you're going to start
3283.86s: to see a whole bunch of crop of these
3285.60s: whatever whether they're you know
3287.78s: shipping stocks or hotel stocks or
3290.46s: semiconductors
3291.72s: and then I'll look at the group and then
3293.46s: I'll distill down I'll break down into
3295.86s: what's the leader within the group now
3297.42s: here's the issue anybody can find those
3300.18s: through screening but how do you know
3302.88s: which ones are viable and are you
3305.10s: usually when you find it you're going to
3306.66s: be late and it's going to be really
3307.62s: extended that's the third biggest
3309.30s: mistake rookie mistake is buying
3311.28s: extended you're like I found the number
3313.26s: one group I found the leader in the
3314.94s: group it's got everything but now it's
3316.14s: it broke out from it's 75 it's 95 now
3318.72s: it's 20 points over the breakout from
3320.88s: the digestion but if you're a rookie
3322.38s: just buy it and then it pulls back and
3323.76s: you're like it was the right name it was
3326.10s: the right sector but you your timing was
3328.38s: off you don't understand
3329.70s: um congestion digestions bases
3332.94s: chart patterns form they're just
3334.98s: digestions whether it's a flat base a
3336.72s: cup and handle a double bottom what head
3339.06s: and shoulders they're congestion areas
3341.10s: with support and resistance
3343.08s: if you're buying extended from the last
3346.14s: digestion you're a rookie that's
3348.36s: probably the fifth one
3350.72s: now how do you balance especially if
3353.70s: these are a longer term thesis right
3355.14s: like if we're looking at a a three-year
3357.84s: weekly chart that seems like a pretty
3359.58s: long thesis if there's a breakout and I
3362.76s: actually remember spending a lot of time
3365.34s: um in Bill O'Neill's book on this
3367.38s: because I found it so interesting it
3369.84s: seems fascinating to me how imperative
3373.26s: it is to get that initial timing right
3375.36s: even though this can be a really long
3378.36s: thesis it seems like it's a really long
3380.22s: thesis you would give yourself more time
3383.10s: more variance but obviously his argument
3385.44s: is you re you get to reduce a lot of
3387.72s: risk if your timing is very good
3390.30s: so how do you find that balance between
3393.72s: getting your timing as good as possible
3395.70s: but then also getting into something
3397.62s: that you're expecting to run for the
3399.42s: next year or whatever it is
3401.28s: two things okay the only time you're
3404.04s: going to find a 99 comp stock with Sky
3406.44s: High RS in a base is in a bear Market
3409.38s: because the second that bear market ends
3411.12s: I call them basketballs underwater it's
3413.28s: just gonna pop straight up and it's
3414.36s: going to be extended into a day
3416.40s: so if you don't catch it on that day
3418.08s: you're now buying extended and your risk
3420.30s: is up
3421.50s: now the second part of it is it's not
3423.66s: just enough to catch it at the right
3424.98s: point you have to catch it in size
3428.10s: that's probably the one of the most
3429.96s: underrated things and I I I can't over
3432.90s: stress this you should make I said this
3435.18s: is really important well cushion
3437.40s: the value of cushion
3440.76s: until you have experience you can't
3442.80s: understand how valuable it is if you
3444.72s: don't have cushion and you are using
3446.52s: risk management you you're living on a
3448.56s: Razor's Edge and if you're a and
3452.88s: you have a tml right after a bear market
3455.58s: and it's up 20 and you take that gain
3457.92s: now what now it's extended how are you
3460.80s: getting back in over the 98.4 weeks most
3464.04s: tmls go up like 400 to a thousand
3466.26s: percent and you sold it up 20 at the end
3468.12s: of a new at the end of a bear
3470.22s: Fool's move so it's not just how do you
3473.70s: catch it not extended but you have to
3476.46s: catch it in size because to have if you
3479.94s: have 10 of your account in a stack that
3481.56s: goes up 100 your Equity moved by 10 how
3485.82s: often do you get 100 Gainer well then
3488.16s: you better have more than 10 percent
3490.74s: if now the problem is when you're
3492.84s: transitioning from bear to bowl and
3495.18s: you're used to buying probing positions
3497.28s: of 100 Lots but you really intend to buy
3500.46s: 200 000 shares but you're probing
3501.96s: probing probing so if you get traction
3503.34s: all of a sudden you get traction and you
3505.80s: feel like you're beaten down because
3507.60s: you're probably down for the year you've
3508.80s: lost money you're in a bear but you need
3510.36s: to go put 20 in your whole account in a
3511.98s: stock
3513.48s: at the right time
3515.16s: that is only done with experience No
3518.40s: rookie
3519.56s: very few
3521.48s: I would I will bet every time that you
3524.76s: get a guy who reads Bill's book at the
3526.08s: end of a bear Market they are not going
3527.46s: to get the right stock in the right size
3528.84s: I'm not I'm gonna buy
3532.58s: in the transition phase I'm going to buy
3535.20s: five or six stocks initially probably
3537.78s: buy three on the follow-through day
3541.08s: I'm gonna have to it's a it's your
3543.84s: building positions
3545.52s: your most stocks I buy I Lose I'm wrong
3548.22s: six or seven out of ten don't work even
3550.68s: when I buy them on the breakout day so
3552.72s: that's three out of ten
3554.40s: it's just it's a it's a shifting Matrix
3557.10s: only to be understood Through Time
3559.98s: understanding deeply where you are in
3562.02s: the trend in the market what is the
3564.54s: general Mark how is it acting is it
3566.40s: appropriate now
3567.92s: these this can take decades to learn
3571.14s: okay it's there's no I just explained it
3573.90s: to you in a very cursory fashion but to
3576.48s: really learn it where you know
3580.62s: it's like catching surf there's there's
3582.60s: normal waves then there's gigantic waves
3585.54s: and then there's waves that come around
3586.80s: every five years
3588.60s: well you have to stick around for 20
3591.00s: years to be through the five big waves
3593.28s: periods to understand man now it's time
3595.86s: to throw the hammer down
3597.42s: okay we gotta open fire right now it's
3600.18s: it is go time you're in the breach
3601.74s: there's no flinching now and it's worth
3604.38s: the risk that's when I can take risk I'm
3607.56s: willing because I know
3608.94s: that the odds are high enough where if
3611.16s: I'm wrong it's worth taking that risk
3612.90s: but in a crappy Market
3615.60s: in a perfect 99 com stock that limps out
3618.72s: of a base
3620.22s: I'll throw something at it to test it
3622.62s: it's more of a test I'm not even trying
3624.66s: to make money I'm trying to determine if
3626.46s: the Market's ready for me to go all in
3628.38s: I'm waiting it's like playing Texas
3629.94s: Hold'em I'm waiting for the right setup
3632.34s: what do I have what's showing it's early
3634.20s: and now I wanna now I wanna well I want
3636.78s: to slow play it to get them all in but I
3638.40s: want I need to ramp the I need to ramp
3640.08s: that pot up I need to make it worth my
3641.76s: while
3642.90s: I just said about 50 things one of the
3645.66s: things you said there though that I
3647.04s: actually really love too is just this
3648.60s: idea of like remaining engaged because I
3651.60s: do believe at least for some Traders a
3654.30s: lot of people sometimes go through
3656.46s: periods where especially the last few
3658.68s: years at least I know them where they
3660.36s: move to cash they're not doing anything
3662.64s: and then they get really gun shy to do
3664.92s: anything again because they can't get
3666.30s: the timing they're not confident in
3667.86s: what's going on I actually really like
3669.48s: this idea that you employ of kind of
3671.52s: putting out these small feeler positions
3673.32s: one to see you know what's working and
3675.42s: to gauge the overall pulse of things but
3677.16s: two I mean it also gets you still moving
3680.22s: you're still doing things and I don't
3682.32s: know if you find benefit from that
3684.18s: momentum in your experience but
3685.86s: definitely for me I find that useful
3688.56s: I'll find things sometimes that I don't
3691.44s: necessarily have the top most conviction
3693.42s: in but the probabilistic outcome still
3695.70s: looks reasonable enough for me that I'm
3698.10s: interested in it
3699.96s: I'm going to just say
3702.24s: I I'm gonna give you a little bit of my
3704.34s: my opinion
3706.20s: we're two and a half years into a bear
3707.94s: Market if this Market makes a new low
3710.16s: it's going to be the fifth longest bear
3712.44s: Market in history
3713.82s: and everyone is discouraged the breakout
3716.64s: the last final three days failed the
3719.46s: Market's acting terrible people are
3721.68s: fearful and they're looking away and
3723.66s: they're going away they're running away
3726.00s: exactly classic fool rookie move
3730.26s: major Trends can occur change in three
3734.70s: to four days it can change everything
3736.38s: can change
3738.24s: and now it's like well the war is
3739.74s: escalating
3741.78s: the government's probably going to get
3743.16s: shut down we have two idiots running for
3745.20s: president one's my idiot there's a lot
3747.48s: of reasons to be very nervous right now
3748.86s: and the market is down
3751.38s: trending down
3754.02s: in four days this Market could look
3755.58s: completely different
3759.66s: you're always three to four the simple
3761.58s: answer you asked me a question with like
3763.08s: 10 sentences I'm going to answer answer
3764.34s: with one sentence you're always three to
3767.34s: four days away from a major Market turn
3769.20s: up or down
3770.70s: and right now
3772.38s: the feeling I get from talking to people
3775.08s: seeing the market in my p l
3777.66s: is we're getting really close to a new
3779.70s: bull market
3780.84s: and everyone's freaking out
3782.82s: so now you can proper Look Away the
3785.40s: rookies Look Away the guys who will
3787.80s: never compound their money for 50 years
3789.84s: are looking away right now the people
3793.02s: who are still engaged in the process and
3794.64s: I don't mean
3795.78s: checking in I mean studying
3799.38s: a lot they will be there I learned this
3802.62s: from a guy at my club
3804.54s: I don't want to give you the full story
3806.28s: because it's too inappropriate but
3811.14s: he just said we're about to have a major
3813.18s: Market a major move in treasuries
3816.54s: and he goes it's not there now he goes
3819.00s: but I guarantee you I'll be there when
3820.50s: it is now whether it came or not it's
3822.48s: not the relevant point the point is he's
3824.40s: a professional and he'd been doing it
3826.56s: for 30 years
3828.00s: he never looked away I mean
3831.30s: dude that's 30 more minutes on stuff you
3833.88s: asked me one question I ran away for
3835.50s: five minutes with the answer
3837.12s: which is perfect that's what you're here
3838.86s: for we're here to listen to you talk not
3841.08s: me I have a YouTube channel and
3843.30s: people see me talk all the time so
3845.64s: you're the star here
3847.56s: um but you started actually diving a bit
3849.96s: more into your current market assessment
3851.64s: which I did want to spend a few minutes
3853.56s: on so you talked about kind of this
3855.96s: underlying sentiment that you think we
3857.52s: might be turning a corner that there
3859.14s: might be a bull market potentially in
3861.00s: the cards it takes only a few days to
3863.40s: see a big change talk to me a little bit
3865.50s: more about what you're seeing in the
3866.70s: markets right now that give you that
3867.96s: impression okay let me preface this
3870.48s: whole thing with let's hear it America
3873.06s: is the singlely greatest country in the
3875.64s: world
3876.36s: not by a little it's the best ever in
3879.84s: history if you're in India or anywhere
3883.16s: Thailand and you come up with the
3884.94s: greatest idea in the world
3886.74s: the number one choice for you to go and
3888.66s: start your company is America and the
3890.70s: number two choice is a wildly distant
3892.98s: second choice the world is run by
3895.26s: dictators despots thugs criminals are in
3899.40s: government that's how the government
3900.30s: works around the world outside in Europe
3902.82s: it's cronyism in America we have the
3905.10s: freest markets in the world so um but I
3907.20s: call it the Golden Goose of capitalism
3909.30s: the Golden Goose of capitalism is never
3911.58s: going to be unless it's suffocated by
3913.98s: socialism the Golden Goose is going to
3915.72s: produce the next Blackberry the next
3917.04s: Starbucks the next uh what Wells Fargo
3920.64s: United Airlines Pan Am airlines IBM
3923.22s: Hewlett-Packard digital equipment uh all
3926.22s: these companies because in America
3928.86s: it's one of the only places you can get
3931.02s: rich
3931.92s: and not get incarcerated or imprisoned
3935.04s: or have it taken from you
3943.64s: the CEO of Luke oils in Russia sitting
3946.80s: in prison these were 30 billion dollars
3948.30s: he's in jail he's lucky they didn't just
3951.06s: kill him but the Golden Goose of
3953.34s: capitalism is never going to stop
3954.96s: birthing these opportunities
3957.78s: so you said it looks like we're gonna
3960.30s: have a bull market
3962.40s: I said you said that it looks like we're
3964.98s: going to have one now
3966.60s: we're always going to have a bull market
3968.52s: unless we get suffocated by socialism so
3970.80s: there's always more this the guys out
3972.72s: here in the labs in the Science Park not
3975.30s: too far from here they don't care about
3977.40s: a recession or a bad Market they're
3979.56s: they're mixing and test tubes and
3981.66s: splicing atoms and you know writing code
3984.60s: so the market we just have to get the
3987.06s: the General market to get in gear here
3989.94s: now let's take a look at history I think
3992.46s: the market topped not when the index
3994.62s: tapped it topped when the advanced
3996.72s: decline line topped in February of 21
3999.74s: which means we've been in a bear for two
4002.06s: and a half years that is really long by
4004.64s: historical standards now you can fight
4006.14s: with me on when but no matter how you
4008.18s: look at it you want to go from the top
4009.56s: of the um Mark the top of the market
4011.90s: made it the top the Russell made it's
4015.26s: still long by historical standards and I
4017.00s: think it's longer than that
4019.16s: in order to assess
4022.22s: where we're going to be you can't look
4024.50s: behind you you can't look at what's
4025.88s: happening today you have to look what's
4028.22s: going to be in 18 months this is Stan
4030.02s: drucken Miller
4031.10s: in 18 months the FED will have crushed
4032.84s: inflation the FED is not going to screw
4034.94s: this up they may kill the economy but
4037.64s: they are not going to let inflation get
4038.96s: out of here they could they could break
4040.28s: the economy which would then we're gonna
4041.96s: have a recession but you know many bear
4044.06s: Market or bear markets end in recessions
4046.88s: people like it's a recession the market
4048.26s: starts going up like I can't buy so
4050.42s: anyway the FED at the very least will
4053.12s: not be raising rates in 18 months they
4056.24s: may raise rates two three more times
4057.92s: they might raise one they might not
4059.84s: raise at all but 18 months from now they
4062.42s: are not going to be raising so monetary
4064.94s: policy will be a
4066.68s: it may not be a Tailwind if they're not
4068.42s: cutting but it's not going to be a
4069.74s: headwind
4071.00s: again this goes back to the Golden Goose
4072.80s: of capitalism
4074.42s: I read a report from a very reputable
4076.46s: source that said AI
4078.62s: just fasten your seatbelt for this
4080.30s: number
4081.20s: is going to increase Global GDP
4085.16s: by 15.9 trillion dollars
4089.36s: by 2030.
4091.84s: 15.9 trillion dollars that doesn't
4094.64s: include EVS that doesn't include
4096.32s: biotechnology that doesn't include I
4099.20s: mean there's doesn't include blockchain
4101.60s: crypto digital Revolution
4104.48s: The Innovation that we're sitting in
4106.28s: front of right now is possibly the
4108.38s: biggest I've ever seen the Advent of AI
4110.78s: is going to be bigger than the internet
4112.52s: okay that that's the promise and I have
4115.52s: every reason to believe that it is not
4117.14s: 3D printing
4118.70s: okay it's not
4120.68s: um
4121.58s: this is real if AI improves margins at
4125.84s: most companies but by three basis points
4128.36s: I'm Sorry by three percent
4130.34s: what's that going to do to PES and
4132.56s: earnings growth what if it improves it
4134.48s: by eight percent where will we be when
4137.12s: the FED stops raising rates on a tidal
4139.64s: wave of innovation and now aim ramps
4142.70s: everyone's margins up where's the market
4144.98s: going to be then
4146.24s: but all they're looking at today is we
4148.34s: might have one more rate hike and the
4150.56s: the government's going to shut down in a
4152.54s: week and we got two morons running for
4154.52s: president
4155.36s: they're so short-term you can't if
4157.46s: you're looking out a month
4159.50s: you're missing you're you're damn you're
4161.42s: driving your car through the rear view
4162.50s: mirror you got to look through the
4163.70s: windshield 18 months forward the world's
4165.68s: going to be radically different we might
4167.60s: there could be some type of stalemate in
4170.30s: the war in 18 months Russia won't have
4172.64s: any people nobody people left to fight
4174.56s: the war they won't be dead
4176.90s: um
4177.56s: the sentiment is incredibly ugly and
4181.28s: I'm just telling you those are my
4182.90s: reasons and by the way if you look at
4184.94s: the indexes they remain in a massive cup
4187.82s: and handle you want to look at the
4189.26s: NASDAQ but only Russell not the Russell
4191.84s: and there's another breath measure
4194.30s: until the Russell exceeds two thousand
4198.26s: we're not in a bull market in my opinion
4200.06s: we need to have net new highs over lows
4202.70s: in excess of 150 a day every you know
4205.04s: most days
4206.60s: and maybe as high as four or five
4208.16s: hundred a day net new highs so we're not
4210.80s: there today but Don't Take Your Eye Off
4213.62s: the Ball okay if you decide to you know
4216.38s: this is time to double redouble your
4218.54s: efforts this is no time to be looking
4220.34s: away this is if you're ever gonna Focus
4223.10s: you focus at the end of a bear and I
4225.68s: think we're very very close if we have
4227.24s: to go another year
4230.36s: I will be the most bullish person in the
4232.70s: world that'll be three and a half years
4234.98s: of a bear Market okay you won't be able
4237.08s: to nail you have to nail me down
4239.72s: all right I rushed
4242.84s: I actually think there's a lot of Merit
4245.36s: to your case I believe
4246.86s: a lot of the way that you're positioning
4248.66s: I said it
4250.94s: I'm joking passively oh I know
4254.50s: I could be so wrong dude we could listen
4257.12s: the markets could make a new low before
4259.34s: this happens I'm not saying
4262.04s: well the part that I want to explore
4263.78s: that you were talking about that I am
4265.82s: curious how you value this and I'm gonna
4267.50s: put socks on now because my feet are
4269.12s: cold
4270.32s: um but do you think that
4272.72s: the
4274.10s: prospects of a recession could
4276.20s: drastically extend the time frame that
4279.50s: were in a bear Market because that's the
4281.00s: thing that I agree with you and that I
4283.34s: believe that the FED is very likely to
4285.62s: not permit persistent expanding
4288.50s: inflation like they've made that clear
4289.94s: and I actually that's like other than
4292.34s: them starting super late in my
4294.20s: completely uneducated unqualified
4296.30s: opinion I think they started trying to
4297.98s: tackle this thing a little bit late I do
4300.26s: think that big daddy J Powell has been
4302.96s: pretty clear about his mission
4304.76s: here and he's been beaten that same
4306.56s: goddamn drum the whole time so I give
4308.78s: him a lot of credit for that but I am
4312.20s: curious for the propensity here for us
4315.10s: to have this over tightening cycle that
4318.98s: then puts a pretty big wrench in our
4321.38s: ability to smoothly exit this as
4324.38s: compared to coming down in a fiery ball
4327.08s: I really don't know either way but I'm
4329.18s: curious how you kind of think about the
4331.34s: unwind
4332.90s: so you're you're on to the the lever
4336.62s: that could extend this the odds are the
4338.96s: FED will over tighten that's
4340.52s: historically their the way they hand
4342.56s: they over they over loosen the over
4343.94s: tighten we've had an inverted yield
4345.98s: curve for over a year at least a year
4348.68s: the odds of a recession
4350.84s: but the counter to that well first of
4353.12s: all if we have it depending on how deep
4355.16s: it is people are gonna have to slash uh
4357.50s: s p earnings and that's going to
4359.48s: elongate I'm trying to say yes my answer
4361.94s: to your question is yes a a recession is
4365.60s: going to delay this for a bit
4368.00s: depending on how deep that recession
4370.10s: gets is going to predicate how deep how
4372.62s: much it pushes it forward but if we do
4375.20s: that
4376.10s: think about the duration of this bear
4378.20s: Market you pull a rubber band out like
4380.30s: this it just goes back like that when
4382.16s: you pull it out like this it goes bam
4384.14s: the worst if we have a bear Market a
4386.84s: deeper bear because of a recession we're
4388.58s: going to stretch that rubber band so
4389.72s: hard when it when it comes back we're
4391.28s: going to have a monster opportunity this
4393.50s: will be a generational wealth
4394.76s: opportunity
4396.02s: but the other side of it is and this is
4398.48s: why the FED is going to really well the
4400.58s: oil could kill the market for the FED
4402.20s: oil right now the oil is the largest
4405.26s: component of the crb which is running
4407.00s: rates which is running the dollar
4408.98s: okay oil rates dollar Kryptonite in an
4413.24s: uptrend
4416.72s: if
4419.36s: we the labor market is so strong
4422.24s: the labor market
4424.04s: it's unbelievable how strong it is so
4426.50s: there's this juxtaposed
4429.32s: issues the fed's trying to deal with I
4431.42s: would not want to be the FED they
4432.80s: painted themselves into a corner but
4434.78s: they're gonna win
4435.92s: and they should remain independent and
4438.08s: you know politicians are going to want
4440.60s: to job own the Fed
4442.22s: to loosen
4443.66s: and Paul's got to hold his ground the
4445.94s: the nightmare scenario is that they
4448.52s: start to loosen when inflation's not
4449.84s: dead now I just don't think they're
4450.86s: going to do that i i as much as I give
4453.86s: them no credit because they're generally
4458.12s: trying to preserve their power as
4462.02s: opposed to do the right thing I don't
4463.58s: think they're going to screw this one up
4465.38s: and if they do I have to change my case
4467.12s: and I am always in flux
4470.54s: I laid out my bull case
4473.12s: I've been doing this I figured it out
4474.74s: because my math is so bad I've been
4476.90s: doing this for 38 years
4478.64s: my experience tells me we are at the
4482.66s: precipice we're very we're Within and
4485.30s: along if we have to wait a year for a
4487.28s: bull I'll be shocked but I will Flex
4491.72s: if the war breaks out into other
4494.18s: continents If the Fed
4497.50s: preemptively lowers rates and inflation
4499.64s: re ignites
4501.56s: but I don't see that that's not my base
4503.66s: case
4505.28s: so again I'm really really bullish my
4509.12s: market temperature for a year out is a
4511.10s: 10. Max bullish short term I'm a two
4515.00s: and after today it's probably like a one
4516.74s: and a half
4518.24s: but I'm looking way down the road and
4520.16s: here's the thing if I said to you Eric
4522.80s: you have to wait 9 to 12 months to
4525.50s: double your money
4527.30s: you're okay with that would you do that
4529.88s: that's what we're looking at this isn't
4531.92s: going to be this is not going to be if
4534.08s: the bull market breaks out in a month
4535.70s: it's not going to be a garden variety
4537.74s: bull
4538.64s: if we wait a year
4543.74s: I mean dude the opportunity it almost
4546.38s: seems like we want this to go on longer
4549.26s: because of that potential momentum up
4551.72s: and out well you do right if you yeah if
4555.20s: you told me I have the choice between
4556.46s: nine to 12 months to double or if I have
4559.70s: to wait 24 months to Triple I mean I'll
4563.24s: take the triple triple and a half but
4565.16s: you're logical and willing to wait and
4567.02s: you're patient most people want right
4568.88s: like you know the game listen we're
4570.02s: going to put a dollar bill in the middle
4571.16s: of five people every 30 seconds and the
4573.86s: longer you wait the more we'll put in
4575.78s: and how long were they until they
4577.10s: grabbed the money they always screw that
4578.78s: up okay people want it now and that's
4581.00s: another thing people want to get rich
4582.14s: quick they want to do it now they want
4583.82s: someone to give them the stock idea not
4586.52s: the re reasoning to find it people are
4589.58s: just lazy are not very late you said
4593.18s: about information and information
4594.26s: overload
4595.76s: it's not lack of information that people
4597.74s: don't succeed it's lack of desire to
4599.66s: read the information and then it's like
4601.40s: a discipline to implement it and it's
4603.44s: lack of perseverance to implement it for
4604.94s: decades
4605.90s: you wonder why people don't get rich
4611.30s: so yeah your case is right I believe
4613.46s: your case strongly I'm going to run out
4615.14s: of power
4617.06s: um
4618.56s: anyway
4620.12s: That's it man I believe strongly we are
4622.58s: at my 30X years of experience tell me
4628.76s: dude people not just anybody
4632.06s: brilliant people CEOs of major companies
4634.58s: are saying AI is the greatest
4637.76s: opportunity in our lifetime it is akin
4640.88s: to the invention of electricity
4643.34s: all right this is a
4645.92s: how do you balance hype though because
4648.26s: to be clear I'm actually of the same
4650.96s: exact opinion of you I really do think
4653.06s: AI is revolutionary but I also saw all
4657.20s: of these different metrics talking about
4659.00s: how the metaverse was going to be an 800
4662.18s: billion dollar business within by I
4665.36s: literally think it was like 20 25 or
4666.98s: 2030 or something like that it was like
4668.30s: very quick and that one I honestly
4670.82s: didn't really believe in but still like
4672.86s: I'm not the authority it Cooter could
4675.32s: not happen but my point is you know
4677.18s: people can get a little emphatic about
4679.94s: things how do you
4682.76s: structure that how do you value that I
4685.76s: haven't bet it yet marked in a downtrend
4688.70s: when the trend turns up I'm a trend
4690.92s: follower and I'm going to follow it as
4692.78s: long as it goes
4694.94s: okay I watched the build out of the
4697.34s: internet from Ground Zero IPO department
4699.62s: at Morgan Stanley okay I took a lot I
4702.56s: was involved in allocation of these
4705.08s: deals I mean I did Palm I did read back
4707.42s: brocade tons of names big names
4710.78s: and I watched the internet get built out
4712.52s: and I watched the companies come public
4713.84s: and I watch what they did and I watched
4715.34s: how most of them didn't have I've seen
4716.78s: this before
4718.52s: this is not 3D printing okay and the one
4722.54s: rule I read to you was
4724.76s: think for yourself on face value
4728.06s: did the metaverse seem to meet you like
4730.34s: I'm gonna put you know the most unsexy
4732.32s: thing you want to repel the opposite sex
4734.06s: put headgear on your head okay it's just
4736.82s: it's just it's a it's there's there's
4738.02s: lag in them they're just a pain in the
4740.30s: ass the metaverse is gonna have some
4743.00s: uses but on face value when I looked at
4745.46s: it I didn't really I I kind of wanted to
4747.98s: get lured into it but it's been the
4750.80s: grandest failure
4752.84s: AI is already
4756.04s: changing SAS companies
4759.10s: servicenow Adobe uh HubSpot
4763.46s: um Palo Alto for security the AI in the
4768.92s: drug Discovery for biotech now this is I
4771.98s: believe this now I haven't bet it
4775.64s: because there's being right and then
4778.70s: there's being right at the right time
4780.50s: and this is not the time today
4784.34s: but we could have a follow-up day late
4786.02s: next week or early next week and if we
4788.42s: do I'm gonna probe it and if I get
4791.48s: traction I'm going to build
4793.46s: but if we make a new low into the fall
4797.24s: into Thanksgiving and you know the IWC
4800.18s: the smoke look
4801.98s: IWC almost made a new low for this whole
4804.14s: cycle the Russell is is a a base hit a
4808.40s: way for making a new low for the cycle
4811.70s: which will definitively make this the
4814.16s: fifth largest bear longest bear Market
4815.84s: in history
4817.04s: okay
4818.12s: so I believe it and I'm a huge optimist
4822.38s: but until the trend concurs with my
4825.56s: thinking or confirms it I don't bet it I
4828.38s: have an opinion
4829.58s: and I don't bet opinions until the trend
4832.40s: confirms my opinion I will bet the trend
4835.16s: against my opinion if the trend moves in
4837.50s: a direction I don't believe it I will
4840.32s: the I make mistakes and lots and lots of
4843.74s: them and when the trend turned up in the
4845.96s: big seven in January February of this
4849.14s: year
4850.76s: I didn't bet it because I just thought
4852.68s: the market was too thin
4855.44s: look I I'm telling you after as many
4857.90s: years as I've been doing this I make
4859.40s: mistakes okay but again what separates
4862.52s: the greats from the altarans and the
4864.08s: losers is how fast do you recognize you
4866.42s: made a mistake
4867.86s: and reverse your position and smash your
4870.86s: ego if you have a giant ego
4874.58s: oh no I'm right Mark it's wrong and then
4877.64s: I'll go bye-bye you're out of the you're
4879.74s: you're go you're out
4882.04s: what I like to tell people is uh do you
4884.96s: want to be writer do you want to make
4885.92s: money
4886.70s: and you got to pick one
4888.80s: and it's hard
4890.72s: um I chose golf
4893.30s: my marriage with my wife and the stock
4895.70s: market
4897.32s: well maybe we could how about pickleball
4899.36s: Jiu Jitsu Muay Thai how can we work on
4901.94s: this golf thing A little bit maybe we
4903.38s: could slide a little extracurricular
4906.20s: activity in there
4907.70s: I mean dude all these things take
4911.42s: incredible amounts of discipline
4913.64s: and being wrong
4915.86s: if you Endeavor into almost anything and
4918.44s: you're going to be great you're going to
4919.94s: be wrong a lot to get to the top
4922.46s: if you if you're not going to be wrong
4924.92s: you're not going to get there you're not
4926.24s: trying
4929.06s: well I feel like it also just proves
4931.52s: that somebody's staying in their comfort
4932.96s: zone in a certain circle of competence
4934.88s: and you're not stepping outside of it
4937.46s: because you know to your point and I
4940.22s: feel like
4941.24s: when I look at a lot of Traders they
4943.64s: also miss a lot of interesting
4945.68s: opportunities that's why I like options
4947.96s: and derivatives so much is because early
4950.42s: on I never fell in love with trading up
4954.50s: down sideways I really don't give a
4956.90s: which way the mark it can go in
4958.40s: circles the fact of the matter is as
4960.38s: long as I can find the correct
4961.88s: strategies that fit the current market
4963.38s: environment that's literally all I care
4965.36s: about
4966.20s: so I I feel like your point on the death
4969.08s: of ego and just setting your personal
4972.08s: pride aside and just doing your absolute
4974.54s: best to interface with the markets
4976.16s: really resonates
4977.60s: I
4979.58s: in a lot of ways people think I'm
4982.12s: unusual and you know
4987.68s: there's a I saw a thing today it said
4992.12s: just be happy with what you have and
4994.22s: then there's like the guy who's not
4995.24s: happy with what he has and he wants to
4996.98s: clock
4998.24s: they say live a balanced life
5000.52s: well you can't be number one if you're
5003.22s: living a balanced life because there's a
5004.66s: lot of other people who aren't totally
5006.16s: cool with being a hundred percent all in
5008.20s: on one thing
5009.40s: I spend my time in the markets golfing
5012.94s: eating and drinking with my family and
5014.86s: friends that's pretty much it I don't do
5018.10s: much I travel a lot to play golf
5020.86s: I'm totally unbalanced
5022.96s: I am I'm very happy with what I have and
5026.56s: I don't do it I love I love the money
5028.06s: let's not lie to ourselves but I do it
5030.94s: to be right I do it to notice that
5035.02s: politics are moving like this
5036.22s: interstates are moving like this
5037.30s: Innovations moving like this these
5038.68s: patterns are setting up this is the
5039.88s: leading group this is the leading stock
5041.08s: and all these variables culminate into
5043.72s: something that I believe in and then I
5045.10s: bet it
5046.36s: and then it works
5048.16s: the Fulfillment
5050.08s: the level of satisfaction of being right
5052.90s: trumps the money I mean again I'm not
5055.36s: I'm I'm 58 man I've been doing this for
5058.48s: a long time I haven't I have enough
5061.24s: money I get revved up by the success by
5064.72s: being right by playing Stratego and
5067.90s: figuring out all the moving parts and
5069.46s: and betting it and when it works it's
5070.66s: great it's one of the most greatest
5072.76s: feelings ever
5074.56s: so with that said I like the game I've
5078.22s: learned I've expended an enormous amount
5080.44s: of time and energy
5082.24s: and emotional beatings to learn it I
5085.60s: think to learn
5086.80s: a whole nother like shorting I mean I do
5088.84s: short occasionally but I'm usually wrong
5091.24s: by the time this Optimist goes short
5093.04s: that's a signal for all of you guys
5094.96s: listening but I I don't
5097.90s: I am somewhat happy with the game I've
5100.36s: learned and I think the F necessary for
5102.94s: me to learn another game like Polo not
5105.28s: playing okay out on that
5107.50s: another method of investing
5111.10s: I like the model I use because I know it
5113.44s: really works and I'm good with I guess
5115.66s: I'm good applies I have very much so
5118.48s: specialized and yeah
5120.58s: I think when people bastardize a method
5123.58s: they they they can make it perfect and
5126.46s: better but usually they file it up
5128.50s: look if Bill was a billionaire if I only
5130.72s: make half a bit uh you know 500 million
5133.36s: I'll be just okay and I'm not even
5135.40s: remotely close I'm well I'm doing better
5137.38s: than I was a long time ago you compound
5139.60s: your money for 35 years we'll see how
5141.10s: much money you're only you're 16 years
5142.60s: in man I'll be I'll be old enough to
5145.54s: watch you another another 16 years we'll
5147.40s: see how much you've compounded out it
5149.44s: you'll you'll probably say enough
5151.78s: we'll yeah we'll we'll we'll see so far
5154.42s: so good no complaints so yeah I and it's
5157.42s: funny too because I I'm very similar to
5160.12s: you in that
5161.62s: a lot of what I'm doing is process
5165.40s: driven
5166.60s: I'm at the point now where I've actually
5168.76s: moved a lot of my investable Capital
5171.10s: into other stuff like I invest in
5173.50s: commercial real estate now regular real
5175.30s: estate and it's they're just interesting
5177.52s: to me and there's some really cool
5179.02s: opportunities it's a fun way to learn
5181.36s: different things but to your point I
5183.28s: feel like really embracing the process
5187.06s: has served me very well and I I honestly
5190.06s: think that's probably one of the only
5190.96s: ways people are gonna make it in
5193.84s: anything that they're trying because
5194.92s: again like if when I when I play golf
5196.60s: right I am
5198.70s: I I literally couldn't even feel
5200.74s: comfortable laying like labeling myself
5202.42s: as awful like I shouldn't step foot on
5205.12s: the green like I don't belong
5206.98s: there and it doesn't even begin to
5209.86s: scratch the surface so it's like
5212.50s: for you to get good at golf it means you
5215.44s: went through that same phase I did where
5217.36s: you first stepped on it and you sucked
5220.42s: and then you probably just decided
5223.60s: um let me see if I can do it again and
5225.28s: then you slowly have gotten better and
5226.54s: I'm sure you know over your time frame
5228.10s: playing golf that you've really invested
5230.32s: into that process so it's it's really
5232.54s: interesting to me to see somebody again
5235.00s: like you with another parallel which is
5238.06s: this process driven approach as compared
5241.72s: to outcome driven approach I think that
5243.40s: that's pretty common across the threads
5244.84s: I've seen
5245.80s: I'd never
5247.48s: ever thought what has happened to me
5250.06s: would have happened to me because I went
5251.92s: to see Bill two or three times a year I
5253.48s: never thought I'd have a hedge fund I
5255.28s: just wanted to learn how to make money
5256.96s: and use the markets I love the markets I
5258.70s: didn't I didn't know anybody would ever
5260.02s: want to get me in a podcast like it was
5262.18s: the farthest thing in my mind when I'm
5263.50s: on a jet to California to go see Bill
5265.48s: but all that third you know 30 years ago
5268.24s: I want to see Bill this is what it's
5269.92s: turned into I had no clue when I started
5272.80s: to play golf
5274.12s: I was afraid of tea boxes they had
5276.40s: little ponds in front of them because
5277.84s: they couldn't get the ball over the
5279.04s: little pond in front of me
5281.14s: I don't know if you know about handicaps
5282.70s: but everyone if you my handicap when I
5285.40s: started was a 36 I got 36 strokes and
5288.82s: the reason I hit was a 36 is because
5290.80s: they didn't have a 46. I couldn't even
5292.48s: play to a 36 handicap but going to a
5296.62s: golf pro
5298.24s: once a month
5299.74s: every summer
5301.36s: for 20 plus years has brought my
5303.88s: handicap down into the mid single digits
5306.76s: I mean it was 20 years of debt and I'm
5309.52s: not a great golf I mean I'm a good I'm a
5311.20s: good golfer I'm better than most people
5312.70s: but I'm no scratch golfer
5314.80s: but it didn't it took two decades or
5317.68s: more
5318.58s: investing's taken 30 plus years
5322.72s: um and I and I still mishit tee shots
5325.84s: all the time and I and I lose money
5327.70s: routinely in the stock market but I have
5330.64s: a friend I hang out with a lot of guys
5332.56s: and you know guys bust each other's
5334.06s: balls and tackled each other and my
5335.92s: buddy goes roleplay goes you're a
5337.78s: one-trick pony and he goes but it's a
5340.06s: really good trick
5341.56s: it's one trick I'm really I'm I'm I I
5344.68s: hesitate to even say I'm good
5346.90s: I've had some successes
5349.42s: but the trick I've learned is a is a
5351.64s: value is a if if you're the greatest
5353.50s: male sorter in the world
5355.54s: you better invent a machine that sorts
5357.22s: it for you because you're not going to
5358.42s: make any money I mean the world doesn't
5360.34s: value
5361.42s: packing bushels of corn
5364.00s: the the thing that I engaged in the
5366.64s: Endeavor I chose
5368.38s: when you get it right people are really
5370.18s: willing to pay a lot to have you run
5371.86s: their money okay when you're the
5373.36s: greatest quarterback how many guys can
5376.48s: throw for 500 yards in a football game
5378.76s: or whatever
5381.10s: what's that worth you bring in a winning
5383.44s: team you're bringing a couple billion
5385.18s: dollars worth of AD Revenue are they
5386.56s: willing to pay 30 million a year hell
5388.42s: yeah
5389.20s: the guy selling the beer in the stands
5390.82s: no one gives a about the ability to
5393.04s: take five bucks and hand somebody a beer
5394.54s: anybody can do that it's not a valuable
5396.16s: skill but it doesn't mean he's not
5398.38s: valuable as a human being you might be
5400.48s: the greatest person in the world the
5402.04s: skills he's chosen to master cracking
5405.28s: beers and handing them down a roll guys
5406.84s: is no one gives a right yeah yeah
5410.34s: it's it's really interesting to see and
5413.86s: just learn more about your process I I
5416.38s: mean
5417.36s: I've really really enjoyed talking with
5419.74s: you to be honest it's I figured that I
5421.66s: was going to like you just based on the
5423.04s: way that you have good energy in general
5424.90s: and I find myself similar like I'm just
5426.88s: stoked to be here so every time
5429.40s: I come across other people that have a
5431.02s: similar disposition it Stokes me up even
5432.82s: more but
5434.20s: um before we log off I know that you
5436.48s: have
5437.44s: a couple different places you know
5439.12s: people can check you out learn about
5440.56s: some of the things that you offer could
5442.54s: you share a little bit about those and
5444.04s: then I'll also throw links in the show
5445.54s: notes below
5446.74s: dude I really appreciate it I I enjoy

5535.00s: would have had I never really got to
5536.86s: talk to Bill one-on-one for maybe 10
5538.90s: years after I'd followed him but when I
5541.48s: became an Institutional customer of
5542.98s: O'Neill and Company he would call me and
5545.32s: I would call him and we we talked not
5548.02s: weekly but more more than monthly
5550.66s: had I had that access when I got started

5606.64s: you again to see if I can learn some
5608.44s: more Golf parlance and then to I mean
5611.74s: really I just hate that sport
5613.00s: it's so goddamn boring and slow but
