0.00s: What up, allires, quick market update.
2.70s: Somebody asked if I could take a look at Palantir and you know the answer.
6.76s: It's typically yes, if I can take a look at something that folks are interested in, I'm
10.64s: always happy to.
12.20s: So there was actually an interesting article that lined up really well with why I wanted
16.76s: to do this video and I'll grab the article right now from seeking alpha.
21.72s: I do not know this dude at all.
24.12s: This is just reviewing his work and then we're going to take a look at the stock, but I just
29.76s: want to caveat that this really lined up pretty well.
34.76s: I have to say and there was a couple of them that seemed to be talking about the same
39.84s: thing, right?
40.84s: So if I look at this person unlikely to end well, this one says from rights research,
47.40s: again, I'm unfamiliar with pretty much all of these.
49.80s: This says needs in and video moment to justify its valuation.
54.32s: This person from the polls says I was wrong, but I'm not a buyer.
59.00s: So really interesting actually as I'm flipping through this, I didn't expect to see quite
64.36s: that level of negative sentiment overall from the jump, especially for a stock that has
71.20s: made this level of a move.
75.20s: We've gone from 21 to 66 as of today in the last six months.
83.84s: So this is always an interesting conversation and it's always an interesting like differing
90.72s: of opinions between two different trains of thoughts.
94.20s: And I can tell I haven't read through these yet.
96.56s: We're going to, but I can tell from a very high level, there's probably a significant
103.44s: value component to the way that these people are looking at markets.
108.64s: And I find it again, really interesting when people challenge the valuation of things
115.40s: because we can see stuff like PE ratios have gotten blown so far out.
124.12s: And PE ratios, while important metrics, they're very relative.
130.16s: And this is an Eric's opinion.
132.32s: This is based on a breadth of research that's available literally to everybody to give you
137.36s: you an idea of some of these.
139.96s: You can check out this one by Easton that talks about different kinds of earnings, earnings
144.32s: growth ratios.
146.04s: This one really talks about some of the simplistic nature of earnings by price and price earnings
151.96s: growth and that you actually need to expand a little bit more and include something like
156.80s: what this paper is identified.
159.24s: This is from Brooks and Anderson and this is about using a long term PE ratio as compared
166.84s: to a short term PE ratio, which is very skew prone.
170.04s: So using something that's actually using the past eight years as compared to the last
175.68s: year or two.
177.32s: And then this paper from Zimmerman, which talks about the interpretation of PE ratios
184.24s: again as it compares to growth.
187.12s: So you can check these out at your own leisure.
188.92s: The main reason why I highlight though is that when we use just PE ratios, we can find
195.84s: things that look crazy, right?
197.28s: Like this is saying now it's trading at 177.2 times the forward PE ratio and that sounds
203.40s: psychotic.
204.60s: But the other thing to always remember that lots of companies maintain very high PE ratios
211.88s: for long durations of time.
213.84s: Now I want to be clear, this is not me defending, palancerant any way.
218.16s: This is me talking about PE ratios as a concept so that people can keep that in the back of
224.56s: their minds because when again, we apply a standard value mindset as a trader, we see
230.96s: wow, like this is a, this is just a crazy surplus.
234.52s: If you apply this to like any standard debt metric that our minds are probably defaulting
238.88s: to this skews the way we receive the information.
242.40s: Whereas if you look at it objectively over a much broader data set, you'll find stuff
247.40s: that has crazy high PE ratios, especially in places like tech and whatnot, that just keep
252.56s: flying.
253.56s: So that's not to say that they're a great bargain.
256.08s: That's not to say that there's value.
258.44s: But from a trading perspective, what ultimately matters to somebody like me is does the price
264.40s: go up.
265.72s: I don't care if it goes up because of momentum drift value because your grandma likes it
270.32s: and bought it and she has a bunch of money and drives the price up.
273.44s: I couldn't care less what makes it go up as long as these candles keep going up, that's
277.88s: what I ultimately care about.
279.68s: So this I thought was really interesting and I wanted to poke through this one really
284.12s: quick and then actually take a look through the options chain and stuff like that.
289.04s: And let's see, let's see what this person has to say.
292.48s: It looks like they've been covering it for a while.
295.36s: They rated it as a sell due to over valuation, limited growth, bearish calls successful
301.48s: about a year.
302.48s: See, and again, this is the problem, right?
306.08s: To me, looks like somebody that is trying to cope a little bit because if you're talking
312.52s: about somebody that's using stuff like PE ratios, that's not something that reflects
316.96s: in value overnight.
319.04s: Meaning this is inherently somebody that's talking about this from an investment time frame,
323.28s: right?
324.28s: And you can see that reflects well here, might not end well for buyers in two to three
328.32s: years.
329.60s: So this I find a little again, just copie.
332.88s: Or we're saying that it's good for about a year and then it wasn't.
336.56s: So I would rather just talk about stuff objectively.
340.00s: But anyways, due to the persistent over valuation, couldn't upgrade, pal, and here to buy.
347.24s: Again, I don't know if that's just like something with their model.
350.48s: I don't know this person.
351.48s: They could have a very specific model that they looked to follow, but I personally would
356.76s: find this a constraint in a model if this is the premise work.
362.84s: Or it might call into question what the system of valuation is if you have something that
369.16s: is considered overvalued.
371.36s: But then let's see when they change, I don't know when they change their rating.
380.24s: Let's see, this one says, be realistic, the stock is not worth it.
385.08s: And this is from five October 21.
387.68s: Now I want to be clear as I'm looking through this, anybody can make a call that's wrong.
392.12s: So I'm not getting on them at all for putting something out there that clearly ended up
397.00s: not being the case simply because it like just because they're putting their opinions out
404.24s: there publicly, obviously it will get a little more scrutiny.
408.40s: But I like I've made plenty of wrong calls.
410.72s: I am not pretending like I'm any better than anybody else at all.
415.96s: All that being said, I just want to see how this has moved since they talked about it.
420.76s: So it was about 20s up until the 66th handle now.
425.00s: Okay.
426.32s: So then they upgraded to a hold in February of 23.
434.00s: So I don't really know what that means.
438.00s: It's a good timing, great timing on that quote unquote upgrade.
441.28s: I mean, this looks like it would be a buy.
443.88s: I can tell that they're using very much a standard value perspective, right?
447.32s: Because they thought 25 too high.
449.44s: They thought obviously there's value in here with it between five and 10.
453.60s: And then obviously there's been recent catalysts driving it up significantly since then.
458.52s: So I would give this partial credit, right?
460.56s: I think upgrading it doesn't, upgrading it to a hold doesn't mean buy.
465.20s: So that essentially means that there's no purchase going on there.
467.76s: So I wouldn't call that correct.
470.56s: But not putting it as like a seller, whatever they maintain, that's good.
476.40s: So let's see.
479.28s: I could give balls another catalyst, glowing over valuation, limited returns, years ahead.
486.12s: Today we see the company's growing bounds and leaps, leaps and bounds, I guess, leaps
491.60s: and bounds.
492.60s: That sounded weird when I said bounds and leaps.
496.16s: Believe the current valuation is primarily driven by unrealistic hope and overextended
499.84s: expectations rather than tangible fundamentals.
501.80s: And I don't, again, from one of the things that we have to keep in mind when we look at stuff
505.68s: like this are different perspectives.
507.68s: They're applying a very different lens.
509.72s: They're applying a value investing lens.
512.84s: So there's, I completely agree with them from a value perspective.
516.96s: This absolutely looks very, very, very overvalued.
521.68s: Just on an objective basis with something with really high PE ratios.
525.36s: And to go all the way back to the original point, just because something has a high PE
529.60s: ratio does not mean that it can't continue to go up, but it does mean for somebody that's
533.84s: a value investor, they're probably going to try to look other places where they can get
537.60s: better value, super normal.
540.16s: So let's take a quick look at actually what's going on here at Accuracity.
543.92s: On a one year timeframe, we've gone from 15 to 67.
547.96s: On the six month we already looked at, we've essentially tripled.
551.56s: And on a three month timeframe, it's still in a really, really aggressive growth phase.
557.24s: The other thing I want to highlight is earnings smashed.
560.72s: It was expected as a nickel and it came out of the dime.
563.36s: So two times expected earnings is really, really solid.
566.84s: Its earnings performance here also did a great job.
569.72s: It was expected at four cents came in at nine.
572.20s: So the reason why that matters to me is because earnings growth is a big factor for stuff
577.00s: like this.
578.16s: And this is a, from a, a traders perspective changing the lens to my lens.
584.60s: A positive post earnings announcement drift is a thing.
588.36s: And it's exhibited it here so far.
590.44s: It's exhibited it here so far.
592.60s: It's a really dominant effect.
594.96s: Again, that's well researched.
596.24s: You can learn about it as much as you'd like online.
598.56s: You can go to SSR and check it out.
600.04s: So there's tons of information out there.
602.16s: So from a chart perspective, from a trading lens, this looks great to me.
606.24s: There's nothing I'm seeing that's freaking me out.
609.76s: Stuff is going to consolidate.
611.64s: It's going to contract.
612.80s: That doesn't mean it's straight up from here.
615.00s: I have no idea.
615.96s: That's not the way that I trade trying to predict with any sort of precision.
619.72s: I try to play probabilistic moves.
622.24s: And as long as it continues this sort of trajectory, it looks bullish to me.
627.68s: And then as soon as this starts leveling off too much volume starts expanding and it's
632.72s: dropping those kinds of things, that's not good.
634.88s: And that makes me take some pause.
637.28s: Now I do see RSI is heavily overextended here without a doubt.
642.76s: It's been overextended essentially from here, which is pretty intense to be honest,
646.68s: because the RSI with a seven day view out moving average generally doesn't hold this
651.52s: kind of configuration.
653.12s: So it is definitely redlining on a relative strength index perspective.
659.60s: So let's take a look at some options here.
662.44s: We have 1.7 million calls against 1.4 million puts.
667.40s: And we are all over the map in terms of explorations.
670.88s: We have stuff everywhere.
672.96s: We do absolutely have moderate calls skew here.
677.24s: Now if we take a look at some of the near term explorations for kind of a better look
682.20s: at what we're expecting near term over the next two primary exploration cycles, it's
687.32s: been 40 versus 664.
690.00s: And then in the 20 Ds, it's 308 to 272,000.
695.68s: Oh, I so yeah, I mean, it's kind of in the short term people, it's a mixed bag.
702.84s: So that tells me that there's got to be larger skew that starts to emerge like as we get further
707.44s: out here, 17 April.
708.96s: This is typically a bigger exploration cycle about matched 129 to 125.
715.12s: And then out in 19 set, it's actually inverted with 55,000 puts against 51 on the call side.
722.64s: That's the first we saw that same thing in oct.
725.04s: And then all the way out in Jan 26, you could tell people are pretty bullish where we have
728.88s: 165,000 against 109.
731.92s: So yeah, I mean, overall positioning here definitely still looks slightly bullish.
737.84s: I would call it slightly bullish.
740.24s: And we do have decent IV, but nothing is drawing my eye excessively.
747.68s: Now I want to take a look at the vol.
750.56s: Let's take a look at the averages first.
753.88s: And then we'll do the out of the monies.
758.16s: And yeah, I mean, this doesn't surprise me.
764.16s: It's take a look at that out of the monies.
765.68s: It's favor in the put side as per usual.
769.24s: And yeah, I mean, there's nothing sticking out to me here from like a weird vol perspective
775.96s: or anything like that, except this 20 June being this elevated relative to those, but that's
780.84s: a vol thing that doesn't really matter for this overall, like just looking at broader positioning.
786.56s: So yeah, I mean, this, it looks fine to me.
790.08s: I don't see anything in here that's leading me to believe that we're unwinding superfast
795.32s: or anything.
796.32s: A couple of the things to look at quick.
798.24s: If we take a look at insider sales for the past month, there's a couple in here that
804.24s: are a little heavy.
805.60s: So we can see like this changing 23% 18% of ownership.
810.92s: This stuff doesn't look too crazy, 5% 4% that's people generally taking comp out on
817.12s: things that are at really high levels on a relative basis.
820.40s: So don't, don't hate them for that at all.
823.16s: But this is a little interesting because these are, these are bigger.
827.68s: These are absolutely bigger trades.
830.56s: And let's see what they have going on.
832.52s: And you can see that there's a little bit of a rationale here.
835.96s: So this says transaction represents automatic sale of shares to cover required tax with
842.24s: holding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock units.
846.12s: So yeah, nothing in here that is alarming to me.
850.88s: Then a lot of this looks to be structurally driven.
854.48s: So yeah, I mean, from an insider trading perspective, I like to see if they're going
857.64s: to have a big sponsorship flipping around.
860.36s: And definitely more on the sell side than buy side, there's absolutely no doubt about
864.80s: that.
865.80s: But it doesn't look like there's a mass exit is turning to like that.
870.52s: So when I think about Palanty here, I think about a stock that's had a really good run.
878.44s: Who knows how far it goes?
880.52s: There's a lot of wind at its back from a pure trading lens.
885.60s: It's still showing strength.
887.24s: So until it doesn't show strength, that's when I change my opinion.
892.16s: I apply Bayesian statistics.
893.84s: I'm not out here making calls like people talk about.
897.04s: I don't care at all about that.
898.28s: I care about making money.
899.96s: And a big part of that when you come to analyzing the price of individual tickers is applying
905.20s: a Bayesian analysis.
906.20s: That means this new information comes out.
908.44s: We then change what we're doing based on that new information.
912.52s: And it's simply because it's difficult from a trader's perspective to project out what
919.04s: might be in 52 weeks.
921.28s: I have no idea what can happen over 52 weeks.
923.76s: So there's no way I could say I love this thing a year out from now because my job as
929.24s: a trader is to trade movements as they're happening.
933.00s: Now from a value traders or value investors perspective, it's completely different.
937.60s: They're looking to find things that are at really good relative values compared to the
941.36s: probability of the business doing really well in the future.
944.48s: And they play those longer, longer moves dealing with the shorter term price variation.
950.04s: So just a difference in approach, really, really interesting article.
953.32s: There's nothing in there that I think is off just very different lenses, which is fun
957.28s: to take a look at.
958.68s: But yeah, those are my thoughts on balance here.
960.44s: As always, if you have any questions, let me know, be an outlier.
962.68s: See you all later.
