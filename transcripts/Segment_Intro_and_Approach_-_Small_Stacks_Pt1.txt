0.80s: hey everyone eric here starting up a
2.80s: really fun segment i think i'm calling
4.56s: it small
5.12s: stacks and essentially what i'm going to
7.12s: do is
8.16s: take a segment of my portfolio and trade
10.96s: it
11.28s: as if i would a smaller account so i
13.68s: decided to take
14.92s: 5k and the reason why i picked that
17.60s: number is i think that that's like
19.20s: pretty much the absolute minimum you
21.44s: should consider
22.88s: trading options with so with that part
26.08s: in mind i want to jump over to the main
28.08s: screen and kind of talk through what
29.68s: this is going to look like
31.20s: so it will be a margin account although
34.08s: i
34.56s: do not expect to use margin frequently
38.40s: the goal is not what most people
40.96s: typically attribute
42.64s: i stand firmly in my belief that
45.92s: small accounts essentially you know
48.08s: below 20 25k
50.96s: their primary goal shouldn't necessarily
53.76s: be
54.08s: to turn into a bunch of money and the
56.32s: reason why i say that is because small
57.68s: accounts
58.40s: have a lot of shortcomings that they
61.12s: have to work around
62.00s: i.e the ability to manage risk is a big
64.40s: one
65.44s: so the goals i have for this account is
69.12s: exactly what i would for any small
70.72s: account which is
72.00s: make sure that we're preserving capital
74.56s: and we're learning
76.08s: obviously i don't really need to
79.12s: do either of these so in my for my
82.24s: personal goal i'm gonna try to pace the
84.16s: market
85.28s: in in the account and
89.04s: the reason why that goes a little bit
90.40s: different obviously i've been doing this
91.84s: for a while
92.56s: so uh you know trying to make it a
94.56s: constructive
95.84s: endeavor whereas for most folks i truly
98.72s: think the best possible thing you can
100.08s: focus on
100.72s: is preserving the account not getting in
102.40s: your own way and
104.24s: honing your skill set creating your
105.76s: trading plan paper trading strategy
107.52s: stuff like that so that is my personal
111.12s: goal
111.52s: is i would like to pace the market now
115.36s: i want to talk through my strategy real
118.08s: quick it's going to
119.12s: primarily be covered strangles and
121.76s: potentially some spreads
123.68s: i am expecting not to trade many if any
127.36s: the only reason why i will do any
130.24s: spreads is kind of for instructional
132.24s: slash exploratory purposes it's not
135.12s: because i really like them because i
136.40s: don't
137.12s: so i am going to steer clear of them
140.48s: in general so that is
144.16s: that couple
147.52s: notes that i want to highlight risk
150.64s: management
151.60s: is going to be tough that's the case for
153.60s: any sort of small account i accept the
155.52s: fact that
156.32s: i very frequently will be over allocated
158.88s: it's
159.44s: again just how small accounts go
162.80s: now i want to put this disclaimer out
164.56s: because i really think to many people's
166.56s: dismay
167.60s: they're going to expect me to be
168.80s: wheeling and dealing and
171.36s: trading a bunch and it's i'm not it's
173.60s: probably going to be pretty boring for
174.96s: most people
176.24s: because i think that that's the right
178.32s: way to approach a small account is to
180.08s: not actively trade it trying to
182.08s: capture intraday moves and stuff like
183.92s: that i think
185.36s: if you're lucky you'll break even doing
187.20s: that if
188.88s: more probably more probable than not
191.04s: you'll lose money
192.32s: so again my approach is going to be to
194.48s: model this account just like i would
196.24s: again if like five thousand dollars is
198.40s: all i had and i wanted to grow it
200.72s: so in in that vein it's gonna be
204.40s: a lot of buy and hold so it's gonna be
207.60s: what it's gonna be
208.48s: i i wanna share that up front because i
210.72s: know that a lot of folks want to
212.00s: actively trade and stuff like that
213.76s: if you have a small account i don't
214.96s: think it's a good idea so i'm not going
216.88s: to do it i'm not going to set some sort
218.32s: of poor example i'm going to try to
220.00s: do what i say i think is best and try to
223.28s: prove
224.00s: why i think it's you know the the right
226.48s: approach
227.36s: so next video from here is going to be
230.08s: i'm going to create a watch list one of
231.52s: the biggest
232.32s: issues for smaller accounts especially
234.88s: if i'm talking about
236.00s: you know buy and hold is finding
238.24s: products that
239.28s: i can buy enough of in order for it to
242.24s: be a meaningful purchase
243.92s: so with that kind of is the the baseline
246.88s: here
248.08s: we'll have to look through see what fits
250.24s: our criteria
251.52s: and i will share that watch list once i
253.68s: build it out and then
255.04s: we will go forward with outlining some
257.36s: of the strategies what i'm going to be
258.48s: looking at doing you know a little more
259.84s: in depth
260.80s: and then we'll just do you know account
262.96s: updates just like i do
264.64s: for my personal account on a monthly
266.24s: basis stuff like that so looking forward
268.40s: to this segment if anybody has any
269.68s: questions or anything that they want to
270.80s: make sure i cover
271.68s: anything like that feel free let me know
273.84s: and let's see what we could do with this
275.92s: 5k account
