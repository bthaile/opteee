692.00s:  you
720.22s:  you
722.22s:  still
732.98s:  for
735.00s:  you
736.00s:  school
738.00s:  and
740.00s:  being
742.00s:  you
744.00s:  which
746.00s:  you
746.24s:  who
748.00s:  you
748.96s:  with the money.
750.52s:  So there's an exchange going on.
754.04s:  And my argument for everybody to get involved in investing
757.88s:  is not to not work.
761.08s:  What you'll find is as you develop wealth,
764.32s:  the concept of not working is actually really not interesting.
769.84s:  And it's also tremendously unfulfilling.
774.48s:  What most people desire when they say,
777.88s:  I can't wait to not work anymore.
780.24s:  What they really mean is they can't wait to have a choice.
785.96s:  They can't wait to have a choice about when they work,
790.16s:  what they work on.
792.16s:  Maybe there's elements of a place that you work
795.04s:  that you just kind of put up with
796.28s:  because you still want to keep your job there
798.20s:  because it's stable.
799.28s:  But in the ideal world, you wouldn't do those things.
803.20s:  That's the rub.
805.44s:  That's the problem with working.
807.80s:  It's not the work itself.
809.84s:  It's when you need money,
813.20s:  you are forced to sacrifice more of your autonomy and freedom
818.20s:  in order to get the money.
820.60s:  However, if you are financially free,
825.00s:  you can sustain yourself,
826.20s:  you can sustain your family or lifestyle,
828.68s:  you then develop voice.
831.44s:  One of the best possible examples I can think of,
833.76s:  and this again, it's not to get political,
835.52s:  it's just a great recent example during COVID.
839.08s:  There were a lot of people in a lot of different jobs
842.12s:  that were either forced to get the vaccine
846.12s:  or they were going to be out of a job.
848.80s:  Whether you want to get the vaccine or not, totally up to you,
851.04s:  I honestly don't care at all.
852.48s:  The point I'm making is for a lot of people,
854.36s:  the decision was essentially being made for them.
858.28s:  You either have to get this
861.04s:  or you don't work here anymore.
862.92s:  And there's always repercussions for our choices.
865.52s:  It's okay, I don't think there's anything wrong
867.28s:  with the company saying you have to get this.
869.24s:  It's up to the company.
870.76s:  The point I'm making is that when you work anywhere,
874.36s:  when you work for anywhere else,
876.72s:  you don't control things.
878.80s:  It's not up to you.
880.32s:  You're going to have a boss of some sort
883.92s:  who's going to have their preferences, opinions,
886.88s:  their ways of doing things.
887.96s:  And rightfully so, they're the boss, you're not.
891.00s:  The downside to that is then you either,
893.12s:  you have to make a real hard choice.
894.96s:  And if you have a family,
896.44s:  maybe you're the sole breadwinner
898.36s:  and you're essentially met between two things
900.76s:  in the middle of COVID,
902.52s:  either I have to get this vaccine in order to stay at the job
905.84s:  or I need to leave the job voluntarily or get fired
909.80s:  and then try to find another job in a current job market
912.12s:  which is really, really challenging.
913.88s:  Again, there's still a choice there.
915.64s:  The point I'm making is that there's a lot of pressure
917.84s:  and that's purely alleviated.
920.24s:  Imagine if that person was financially free.
923.68s:  Then that person could objectively choose
926.48s:  whether or not they want to get it completely on their own.
928.96s:  They're choice.
929.92s:  Yes, I want to get it.
930.92s:  I think it's the right thing.
931.80s:  I'm a first responder.
932.72s:  I think it's important.
933.92s:  No, I don't want to get it for X, Y and Z reasons
936.24s:  entirely up to the person.
938.00s:  You literally unlock your own freedom when you have money.
944.56s:  It's not just having money for the sake of having excess
948.12s:  to be able to buy a bunch of materialistic things
950.08s:  because again, materialistic things are fun.
952.32s:  I'm completely honest about that.
954.80s:  But they will not make you, they literally will not make you happy.
959.08s:  What I try to remind people is if you are happy
961.44s:  before you had money, when you have money,
964.24s:  it's just an amplifier.
965.68s:  Shits way more fun.
966.68s:  You get to do way more cool things.
968.32s:  You get to help way more people.
970.28s:  You get to be really, really generous when you go get your haircut
973.16s:  or when you have a good dinner.
974.36s:  Like whatever it is, you get to be generous.
976.04s:  That's super fun.
977.92s:  But the way that you get to that is by having not only
982.92s:  base level needs, but abundance.
985.68s:  And that's why I preach to everybody
987.80s:  that you should seek abundance.
989.44s:  Because abundance alleviates all of these things.
992.08s:  The way that you get to abundance
994.12s:  for the vast majority of people out there is through investing.
998.84s:  I used to work at Deloitte.
1000.08s:  It's a management consulting firm.
1002.76s:  We used to spend a lot of time analyzing
1005.80s:  and working on compensation packages
1007.80s:  for companies for clients.
1010.24s:  The way that clients, companies,
1013.36s:  very smartly build compensation packages.
1016.72s:  They do not want things to be too good
1020.32s:  so that you don't have to work.
1023.32s:  So if I pay you a million dollars a year,
1026.76s:  you could work for three years and then essentially not work
1029.08s:  again if you're good with your money after that and live
1030.84s:  fruvely.
1031.84s:  You have an exit pretty fast.
1033.84s:  So if I pay you a bunch of money,
1035.00s:  if I pay you too much money, they can afford it.
1037.08s:  But if I pay you too much money,
1039.12s:  then I don't really retain you.
1041.84s:  What they're looking to do is capitalize on a curve.
1045.04s:  They want to pay you just enough, just enough to keep you.
1050.24s:  So that the friction of changing jobs is just enough
1054.88s:  that you're like, do I want to go through the process
1057.52s:  of updating my resume?
1058.52s:  Do I want to start doing the networking thing?
1060.08s:  Do I want to go through interviews?
1061.80s:  This is okay.
1062.64s:  This is good enough.
1063.48s:  I don't hate it that bad.
1064.32s:  It's okay.
1065.40s:  That's what they want because that's the,
1067.36s:  that is the perfect point for them to price you
1070.64s:  where you're slightly disenfranchised.
1073.32s:  Don't fully love it, but not willing to make the jump.
1078.32s:  That's what they try to price you at.
1080.48s:  So I bring that to your attention
1081.96s:  because from a compensation standpoint,
1084.40s:  companies are not incentivized to pay you a lot.
1086.56s:  They're incentivized to pay you just enough.
1088.80s:  Add on to that the reality again in the US of W2 income.
1093.92s:  W2 income is the sloppiest kind of income you can come across.
1098.80s:  It's good to have, you should have income.
1101.00s:  When I say sloppiest, it is,
1103.44s:  that's the first tax bucket everybody gets to go into.
1107.20s:  And you're going to pay.
1108.40s:  You're going to pay on your W2 income no matter what you do
1110.84s:  no matter what your tax bracket is, you're going to pay.
1113.60s:  That's the downside of W2.
1116.16s:  Now the pro to W2 is it's stable.
1118.76s:  Somebody else is taking the risk.
1120.12s:  You just work for them.
1121.36s:  They're taking all the risk.
1122.32s:  They set up all the infrastructure.
1123.48s:  So I want to be clear I'm not sitting here complaining
1125.56s:  about the structure.
1126.40s:  I'm just talking about the reality objectively as it sits.
1129.76s:  And why you need to invest?
1132.52s:  Because if you don't, you will spend the next 60 years
1138.12s:  starting off not really having to worry about money obviously
1140.68s:  until you're an adult at 18.
1143.16s:  But then from that point forward, you're on the hook.
1145.44s:  You got to figure it out.
1147.04s:  So it's a long time to have to work for other people
1149.84s:  to compromise what your values are, what your morals are
1153.48s:  to spend time working on things that you're half passionate about.
1156.96s:  And the entire purpose of all this is to unlock your ability
1162.04s:  to do this stuff you like.
1163.72s:  Unlock your ability to have true freedom of expression of yourself.
1169.72s:  You don't have to worry about you can dress how you want.
1172.24s:  You can get the piercings that you want and get the tattoos
1174.36s:  that you want.
1175.16s:  You can get the tattoos you don't want.
1176.72s:  Just not get them.
1177.72s:  You can do whatever you want.
1178.92s:  That's the point.
1180.32s:  That is all unlocked through this for the vast majority of people.
1185.72s:  There are other routes to do this.
1187.64s:  You can start your own business.
1189.92s:  What's the downside to starting your own business?
1192.60s:  It's a ton of work.
1194.60s:  Again, not saying it's bad.
1196.04s:  Just talking about it objectively.
1197.56s:  It's a ton of work.
1198.96s:  And you still are going to have clients of some sort.
1203.80s:  You're going to have counterparties B2B.
1205.72s:  You're going to have customers you sell to B2C.
1208.24s:  And you're going to have to tap dance.
1209.44s:  You're still going to have to play the game if you're a business.
1212.12s:  You can make tons of money in business
1214.44s:  if you start a great startup.
1216.00s:  Those are also statistical phenomenons.
1219.32s:  If you think of every successful startup,
1221.24s:  there are dozens and dozens and dozens of failures
1224.64s:  that just didn't make it.
1225.64s:  Doesn't mean that they're not smart.
1226.96s:  A bunch of them are super smart.
1228.04s:  They just didn't time it just right.
1230.20s:  And they got edged out for one reason or another.
1233.44s:  Investing is accessible unilaterally to everybody.
1239.08s:  There's no mispricing.
1240.52s:  There's no somebody having a better relationship
1244.04s:  rubbing shoulders with somebody else
1246.12s:  that gets a better deal than you.
1247.80s:  You have access to the same stuff I do.
1250.68s:  So investing should be deployed in my opinion by everybody.
1257.36s:  Now, whether you choose to become an active derivatives
1260.52s:  trader, tons of routes you can go.
1263.12s:  The baseline is you have to invest.
1264.72s:  And I hope that that point is abundantly clear.
1268.32s:  Next thing.
1271.32s:  This is a general overview of what I consider to be
1278.20s:  the three levers to building wealth.
1282.00s:  The first lever is saving.
1285.04s:  Your ability to save directly feeds into your ability
1289.56s:  to do everything else.
1291.20s:  You can't invest no money.
1294.20s:  So you need to save first.
1296.36s:  Now, that being said, you cannot save your way to wealth.
1302.88s:  If I work a standard job like I showed you here,
1306.88s:  that's my median income.
1308.48s:  You add taxes on top of that.
1310.24s:  You add cost of living expenses and things like that.
1313.08s:  That's not a whole lot left over.
1314.88s:  Don't know what it is.
1315.76s:  It kind of depends on where you are.
1317.20s:  But it's not a whole lot left over that you have
1319.08s:  disposable income on a monthly basis.
1321.72s:  If you save that residual disposable income,
1325.88s:  for the rest of the remaining time you possibly can,
1328.72s:  this won't get you too wealthy.
1332.00s:  It simply will not get you too wealthy.
1335.08s:  Now, let's take a look at a couple examples of this
1339.12s:  to hopefully help drive this point home
1341.80s:  and then introduce the concept of compound interest.
1346.08s:  This is a calculator from my website.
1348.16s:  Everybody has access to it.
1349.28s:  It's for free.
1350.12s:  Go over here to resources compound interest calculator.
1353.76s:  Let's say that you're starting with zero dollar.
1356.48s:  Let's say that you're starting with a dollar.
1358.28s:  You got, I guess minimums of $100 on this calculator.
1361.04s:  So you got a hundred bucks.
1362.88s:  And let's say, I don't know what the minimum return is.
1365.16s:  Can you do zero?
1366.00s:  Zero percent return.
1366.84s:  Great.
1367.68s:  So you start with the hundred bucks
1368.64s:  and let's say that you have $500
1370.44s:  to disposable income on a monthly basis,
1372.56s:  which is probably on the high side for some people.
1374.68s:  Let's do that over 30 years.
1376.88s:  You have mail, no, I'm just kidding.
1379.68s:  You have $180,000 at the end of your 30 years.
1382.48s:  This is the process of trying to save your way to wealth.
1386.68s:  I'm gonna be a good saver.
1388.32s:  I'm gonna save as much of my income as I can.
1391.52s:  It's on average, $500.
1394.00s:  I do that for 30 years.
1395.24s:  I essentially have absolutely nothing to show for it.
1400.04s:  That's the reality here.
1402.08s:  So this is why we need to invest.
1408.48s:  Investing is when we turn this zero into a number.
1414.48s:  It can be the standard market return of eight-ish percent.
1419.16s:  If I do a standard market return of eight-ish percent,
1423.32s:  starting at $100, saving $500 a month for 30 years,
1427.48s:  rather than $180,000, and now I have $680,000.
1430.76s:  This still isn't anything necessarily to write home about,
1433.72s:  but I think we can all agree.
1436.00s:  It is light years better off than $180,000.
1441.00s:  It's just, again, an objective fact.
1444.32s:  So we need to save, that creates the basis for investing.
1448.80s:  Then we need to actually invest the money
1450.68s:  that we're saving.
1452.32s:  Then the third step is to grow your income.
1457.40s:  And you have more choices at that now than ever before.
1460.80s:  There's all sorts of digital manners
1463.20s:  that you can look to expand your income.
1467.20s:  The reason why we need to expand our income
1471.96s:  is because you can only cut so many costs.
1476.96s:  You can only cut so many things before you get down
1479.72s:  to bare bones what you need to live.
1484.60s:  You can only cut so much.
1485.80s:  You still need a place to sleep.
1487.72s:  You still need a way to get to your job.
1489.92s:  If your job is in a physical location that you have to commute to,
1493.12s:  you don't need food to eat, that kind of stuff.
1494.80s:  You can only cut so much.
1496.64s:  You have to find ways to grow your income.
1500.56s:  And some people will say, well, that's hard.
1505.40s:  Welcome to life.
1508.20s:  Life is not easy.
1511.68s:  And if you want to achieve outlier performance,
1518.00s:  which is not this, you're gonna have to do some different shit.
1525.04s:  Because this is what most people do.
1528.24s:  And if you don't want what most people do to happen to you,
1532.64s:  you have to do something else.
1534.44s:  It's literally that simple.
1537.28s:  So this is the approach that I think is accessible to everybody.
1544.28s:  So I think you understand the general point
1548.60s:  on why we need to invest, on why compound interest is so powerful.
1555.32s:  Why this is something that is worth your time in spades.
1560.08s:  Now we can start talking about some more options,
1564.92s:  specific stuff.
1567.20s:  So if you have any questions on that,
1568.96s:  feel free to start throwing those into the chat.
1572.32s:  I'm happy to dive in at anything specific to any of this.
1575.68s:  I don't think there's anything new here, to be honest.
1577.92s:  My guess is for the vast majority of people,
1580.28s:  this is rehashing stuff that we generally already know,
1583.64s:  which is great.
1584.48s:  That's the idea.
1585.92s:  And what I would like to do now is run through
1590.08s:  some very basic option stuff
1592.80s:  and then run through a quiz at the end of this.
1595.88s:  So we'll skip through some of this stuff.
1600.80s:  And this talks a little bit about the difference
1605.72s:  between investing, trading and gambling.
1609.20s:  And this is a conversation that you'll come across
1613.20s:  for lots of people that are honestly pretty pedantic,
1617.08s:  but I throw it in here for general understanding.
1621.52s:  Investing is simply typically longer term in nature.
1624.44s:  Trading is simply shorter term in nature.
1626.80s:  And gambling is two different things.
1631.68s:  Technically speaking, gambling in terms of a definition
1636.44s:  absolutely is trading investing.
1638.60s:  When we're putting up money with the expectation
1640.72s:  of some sort of return, that is gambling,
1643.04s:  that applies to both of these.
1645.44s:  Now there's the common parlance use
1649.52s:  that's a little bit different.
1651.56s:  And the main difference from gambling
1655.52s:  compared to something like trading or investing
1658.52s:  is that in common parlance,
1660.48s:  we would associate gambling more so with entertainment
1663.84s:  or something that has binary end outcomes
1669.96s:  a little bit different than what you'll find
1671.92s:  in non-descrete outcome style markets.
1676.16s:  So the discussion between is trading gambling,
1680.44s:  is investing gambling from a peer definition standpoint,
1683.68s:  their mere images of one another.
1685.60s:  It's essentially same concept,
1687.88s:  but the way that we use the terms very, very different.
1691.36s:  So just something to be generally aware of,
1698.32s:  doesn't really mean anything.
1699.88s:  This is my approach to trading.
1701.16s:  We skip over this.
1702.64s:  And this stuff we'll talk about a little bit later,
1705.40s:  we're gonna get into now quick overview of the markets.
1710.52s:  So the reason why I do this is so that we understand
1716.32s:  where things are, how things fit, what we do,
1720.36s:  who's playing the game with us, those kinds of things.
1723.76s:  So you can see there are a group of participants
1727.88s:  and their different nomenclature, their names.
1732.28s:  So the cell side are typically liquidity providers
1735.12s:  of some sort.
1736.16s:  So those will be exchanges, market makers, brokers,
1739.44s:  IB, stuff like that.
1741.72s:  Byside, generally asset managers, us on the retail side,
1746.80s:  this is in generality.
1750.44s:  You can absolutely find retail that is on the cell side.
1755.44s:  It's just not our primary bread and butter.
1757.72s:  The way to think about Byside cell side
1759.36s:  is who's providing liquidity, who's consuming liquidity.
1761.80s:  That's kind of the idea.
1763.32s:  And then there's buy and sell side, folks that play both sides.
1767.40s:  For securities, these are the things,
1769.52s:  these are the products as I often refer to them as,
1772.84s:  but technically products isn't the correct term
1775.40s:  because products is something that's built and packaged
1778.52s:  and used for something.
1779.84s:  So spy is a product, somebody built that,
1782.40s:  packaged it, it's an ETF or consumption of some sort.
1785.84s:  But all of these different things
1787.56s:  that we typically trade, the correct term is securities.
1791.20s:  So securities are things like equities, derivatives, debt.
1795.48s:  And there's all different kinds of hybrids with a lot of these.
1799.56s:  So for example, derivatives is not limited
1801.60s:  to options and futures.
1802.76s:  That is not limited to bonds and notes.
1804.76s:  These are to give you just a general overview
1806.60s:  of what these things are, what they tend to look like.
1810.08s:  And then there's exchanges.
1811.96s:  So there's actually the Chicago that should be on here.
1815.56s:  It doesn't really matter,
1816.92s:  but this just gives a list of some common exchanges
1820.84s:  that operate and then there's the OCC.
1823.88s:  From an options trading perspective,
1826.00s:  we care about the OCC because they clear everybody's trades.
1829.76s:  So this is the world as we end to see it as retail traders.
1836.28s:  Retail traders are a very small portion
1840.40s:  of this whole ecosystem, we're tiny.
1843.44s:  Now, altogether, we're not an insignificant portion by any means.
1848.20s:  We definitely have a share of the market,
1851.24s:  but most of the money that's moving,
1853.48s:  most of the trades that are being done
1855.24s:  are going to be done by these larger entities.
1857.92s:  So that's that.
1859.60s:  Let's talk quick about why we trade options.
1862.48s:  The basis for this, for everybody,
1866.48s:  is options in my opinion provide these benefits
1871.96s:  that are different than if you're trading things like equities.
1875.32s:  Options grant you leverage.
1877.40s:  Now, I want to be clear, take a step back.
1881.76s:  Equities can have elements of these options
1886.16s:  universally have all of them, a little bit different.
1889.24s:  So you can use them for leverage.
1891.72s:  You can use them to increase your risk,
1893.96s:  reduce your risk via hedging.
1896.08s:  You can trade literally all market directions with options.
1899.40s:  You cannot do that with equities.
1901.56s:  If a market is trending sideways
1903.20s:  in a really tight range bound style movement,
1907.12s:  there's no stock trading strategy
1909.48s:  that you can use to monetize that.
1911.16s:  That's not the case with options.
1912.76s:  You absolutely can.
1915.16s:  You have direct access to volatility
1920.12s:  as a standalone asset class, big deal.
1923.96s:  You also can access things like structural alpha.
1927.92s:  Structural alpha is sources of baked in inherent edge
1933.16s:  that we can find throughout the marketplace.
1935.24s:  A great example of this is variance risk premiums.
1937.92s:  We know that puts tend to be priced more expensively
1941.12s:  than calls.
1942.12s:  That's generally the case, especially for index options.
1945.32s:  We know this because index options
1947.32s:  are often used by large institutions
1949.72s:  who hedge their total risk.
1951.92s:  So for somebody to step in front and to sell that risk,
1956.32s:  somebody needs to offer that risk out.
1960.72s:  The people that choose to offer that risk
1963.72s:  know that we're stepping in front of a moving train.
1966.72s:  Sooner or later, it's going to hit us.
1969.32s:  So we need to make enough money in the aggregate
1971.32s:  so that when it eventually hits us,
1973.32s:  we can still survive and still continue to do business.
1976.32s:  So there's a premium associated with that.
1979.32s:  That kind of thing.
1980.32s:  The other really cool thing about options
1982.32s:  is you can both trade them directly for income
1986.32s:  or you can do that.
1989.32s:  Or you can use them to enhance a standard equity holding,
1993.32s:  which is really, really neat.
1996.32s:  So what I mean by that is if we want to trade them directly
2000.32s:  for income, I can have either certain strategies
2003.32s:  that are really based not on massive price appreciation
2006.32s:  but collecting money up front and then simply churning on those.
2011.32s:  Or I can use a standard stock holding position
2017.32s:  that I might have built already,
2020.32s:  that I want to have that I want to maintain
2022.32s:  for a long-term investment.
2024.32s:  But I can trade options around it to generate some income.
2029.32s:  The beauty of that is conversely to options
2032.32s:  unless it pays a dividend and the dividend is enough,
2034.32s:  you have to start unwinding some of the stock position.
2038.32s:  That kind of sucks if you want to keep the stock position.
2041.32s:  Options, you can keep your stock position
2044.32s:  and you can generate income off of it.
2046.32s:  Pretty slick stuff.
2050.32s:  This walks through our strategy process,
2052.32s:  our trade process, we're not going to get into those today.
2055.32s:  Those will be in the future.
2057.32s:  This is an overview of derivatives, specifically options.
2061.32s:  We're not going to go through this whole thing.
2063.32s:  Again, this is all rehash stuff.
2065.32s:  I have a 101 video that goes into all of it.
2067.32s:  I just want you to have this for your reference.
2070.32s:  You can take a look through it.
2071.32s:  See if anything in here sticks out to you.
2074.32s:  The Cliff Notes version of this, options are derivatives.
2077.32s:  That means that their value is derived from something else.
2081.32s:  So when people are talking about options leading the markets
2085.32s:  and stuff like that, there's some efficacy behind it.
2088.32s:  However, not total efficacy.
2091.32s:  Because you need an underlying asset to price a derivative off of.
2096.32s:  So there can be relationships.
2098.32s:  But there's still tied to an underlying.
2103.32s:  There are two parties.
2106.32s:  Every single option buyer seller buyer has the right to do something.
2111.32s:  Seller has an obligation.
2113.32s:  That's why we collect money upfront.
2115.32s:  Think of it if you're selling something on Facebook marketplace.
2118.32s:  If I'm selling something, I have an obligation to deliver the thing I'm selling.
2121.32s:  I'm going to get money for it.
2123.32s:  Same thing in options.
2124.32s:  Now, options have a few key components as outlined here.
2131.32s:  And this just gives you a quick way to understand how the value of options change
2140.32s:  based on whether or not they are a call or put.
2143.32s:  Those are the two kinds of options that we deal with primarily.
2147.32s:  Calls appreciate in value as the underlying goes up.
2151.32s:  What's appreciate and value as the underlying goes down.
2154.32s:  We can buy or sell either of them to open a trade.
2160.32s:  Basics, basics, basics.
2163.32s:  There are a bunch of different theoretical pricing models that we can use for options.
2169.32s:  And it's actually really, really good to tinker with them, get familiar with them.
2173.32s:  The punchline is options for the vast majority of retail traders.
2177.32s:  They're going to be priced through market consensus.
2179.32s:  They're going to be priced through market makers.
2181.32s:  And these are going to be entities that are going to value what they think the option should be traded at.
2188.32s:  They're going to offer a quote bid and offer to buy or sell depending on the ticker, depending on their book.
2195.32s:  But most of them will offer both sides.
2197.32s:  And if their pricing is off terribly smart institutions, high frequency trading firms and stuff like that,
2205.32s:  will come in and poach those prices and play them against each other.
2208.32s:  So there's literally baked in incentives for them to price correctly.
2211.32s:  Now, there's a lot of different games that they can play.
2213.32s:  There's a lot of spoofing, layering, all those kinds of things.
2216.32s:  But that gets into much more advanced market mechanics.
2220.32s:  In a nutshell, they're incentivized to price generally correctly.
2223.32s:  They're obviously going to price in a little bit of an edge for themselves.
2226.32s:  That's how they make their money.
2228.32s:  But it's going to be priced generally correctly.
2231.32s:  But you can tinker with all different kinds of pricing models.
2234.32s:  You can look at Blackshold Merton.
2236.32s:  That's kind of the standard options pricing model that we use, binomial trees, and so on and so forth.
2242.32s:  The main thing you have to know about an options pricing model is that all of the inputs except one are known.
2250.32s:  We have all these different inputs.
2252.32s:  We need to know what the underlying price is trading at.
2255.32s:  We need to know the type of option, whether it's a color put, we need to know the strike price DTE, risk free rate, dividend yield.
2260.32s:  All of that is known. All of that is known.
2263.32s:  The one thing that is unknown is this one in yellow volatility.
2267.32s:  This is where money is made in forecasting price with respect to options for people that say options are overpriced underpriced.
2277.32s:  This is what they're referring to.
2279.32s:  They're simply saying volatility is overpriced.
2282.32s:  Volatility is underpriced because that's the only unknown variable when we're looking at an options price options trade in contracts or lots.
2293.32s:  Generally, they represent 100 shares.
2296.32s:  There are minis. I don't really see minis around that much anymore, but minis used to be a tenth the size.
2303.32s:  I don't really see them anymore. I think the liquidity in them just was not good.
2308.32s:  There are two primary classes of options. There's more than this. There's permuting options and stuff like that.
2313.32s:  But the two primary ones that we operate with are American and European.
2321.32s:  This differentiates only by the settlement potential for the options.
2328.32s:  So American options can be exercised or assigned at any time whenever you feel like it, whether it makes sense, whether it doesn't make sense, doesn't matter.
2335.32s:  European options can only be exercised at expiration.
2339.32s:  Very, very important note because the way that you price those options is different because early exercise is a risk.
2348.32s:  So there's a different pricing approach when you calculate things like early assignment and bake that into the model.
2355.32s:  There are a few primary ways we can close a position. We simply do the inverse of what we did when we opened it.
2362.32s:  This is the most common. So this is if I bought to open an option, I would sell to close.
2366.32s:  If I sell to open an option, I would buy to close. Not at it.
2371.32s:  Now, you can also settle by exercising if you were the option buyer.
2377.32s:  In general, it does not make sense to exercise.
2381.32s:  The reason why it doesn't make sense to exercise is because you forego the remaining extrinsic value that you can otherwise capture if you sell the option.
2392.32s:  That's the primary reason why early exercise is inherently disincentivized.
2398.32s:  So, and then the last methodology is if an option expires worthless. If you take it all the way in expiration and it's out of the money, it will expire worthless.
2407.32s:  Moneyness will be coming up. I think next. There it is.
2411.32s:  So this looks at an options chain and you can run through this just for your own reference left hand side calls right hand side puts.
2419.32s:  You can see what is out of the money at the money in the money.
2423.32s:  Moneyness simply refers to the relationship of the strike price, which is one of those components of an options contract relative to the underlying price.
2434.32s:  And you'll notice that in the money and out of the money are essentially adjacent to one another for calls and puts calls and puts and a lot of ways are inverses one another.
2444.32s:  You can see that for calls an option is in the money when the option strike is less than the current value and then you can obviously run the derivative permutations for out of the money for both calls and puts from there.
2458.32s:  An option has to primary components to its value. It has intrinsic and extrinsic value.
2466.32s:  And extrinsic value has to primary inputs. It is time value and volatility.
2473.32s:  So when we think about extrinsic value, you can see this option here back on what is this for June 2024. It had seven days to go.
2483.32s:  So that option is going to have a certain amount of time value because there's seven days to go that time value is going to be different than the one that has six days to go different than the one that has five days to go and so on and so forth.
2495.32s:  Volatility is the expected move of something. How much do we think something is going to move that matters a lot because if I'm building a contract and I think something might move around a ton.
2508.32s:  I'm going to price it differently. And if I think it's going to move very little.
2512.32s:  So that's an option chain overview volatility.
2517.32s:  I'm not sure if you're going to have a volatility volatility.
2522.32s:  I'm not sure if you're going to have a volatility volatility.
2526.32s:  I'm not sure if you're going to have a volatility volatility.
2529.32s:  I'm not sure if you're going to have a volatility volatility.
2532.32s:  I'm not sure if you're going to have a volatility volatility.
2535.32s:  I'm not sure if you're going to have a volatility volatility.
2538.32s:  I'm not sure if you're going to have a volatility volatility.
2541.32s:  So I have videos that go over all of that stuff.
2545.32s:  But implied volatility is the annualized expected one student deviation move.
2552.32s:  And then you can look at volatility for different time frames, which will give you the expected move for a relevant timeframe.
2558.32s:  So an example of this is we have T triple cues upgrade.
2561.32s:  So if we go in here to T triple cues, we can see that there's volatility for all these different time frames.
2566.32s:  The volatility for all these different time frames is relevant to the timeframe.
2570.32s:  So then instead of annualizing it across a year, it's essentially trying to say over this 43 day time span, how much do I think the underlying is going to move?
2578.32s:  That's the general approach that it's trying to take there.
2582.32s:  Then we have realized volatility, which is backwards looking historic volatility and realize volatility are calculated slightly differently.
2592.32s:  Not a topic for this. In general, you will see them referred to about the same, but there is a difference.
2599.32s:  I have a video again that goes through all about vol.
2602.32s:  You should just know that there's a slight difference between them.
2605.32s:  Then we have two different ways to evaluate volatility against itself.
2611.32s:  We often use IV rank or IV percentile.
2615.32s:  Again, there's differences in how those are calculated.
2618.32s:  In general, implied volatility percentile is my preferred methodology because it's more representative of what the underlying is doing and it's less skew brown.
2630.32s:  Again, I have a video about that as well.
2632.32s:  You can check out at your leisure, but let's see if we can find an example really quick.
2637.32s:  Just at a curiosity.
2639.32s:  There's a bunch of stuff that has had this is here we go. Great, great example.
2643.32s:  We can see that the current implied volatility in TEE triple Qs is 62%.
2648.32s:  The implied volatility percentile 65%. The implied volatility rank is only 26.6%.
2654.32s:  You might look at the IVR and say, wow, vol is really low.
2657.32s:  But then if you look at the IVP, you're saying damn, vol is pretty damn high.
2661.32s:  It's a difference in calculation.
2663.32s:  The thing to note is that implied volatility rank is very prone to skew.
2669.32s:  It's going to use a high for the last year.
2674.32s:  So wherever volatility jacks up at some point, that's now involved in that calculation until that data input rolls off after enough days pass and that data point falls off the end.
2684.32s:  That's why implied volatility rank is very, very likely to show a skewed number, especially if there's been large moves in the recent past.
2692.32s:  You'll find a lot of instances where they're about the same close to one another and that's just if there's no skew.
2697.32s:  So just another fun fact for you to be aware of.
2701.32s:  We care a lot about volatility in trading options.
2705.32s:  We already literally went over this. So look at us go crushing it, looking at implied volatility percentile versus implied volatility rank.
2712.32s:  And then we have the Greeks where we stop because the Greeks is for another video.
2719.32s:  So I now going to take a pause and see if you have any questions about that market and options overview before we pivot and take a quiz together.
2732.32s:  Now don't worry because towards the end of the session, I'm going to have time for Q&A where we can run through everything.
2741.32s:  I mostly just want to see if anything that we talked about was like, well, what was that?
2745.32s:  Don't understand that concept.
2747.32s:  That's what this time's for.
2749.32s:  Otherwise, we'll keep it pushing and then we'll turn over to the quiz.
2754.32s:  Reese says in your fall video, you mentioned toss labels, IVR correctly.
2758.32s:  Is that still the case? Yeah, almost positive. I'll double check real quick, but almost positive.
2763.32s:  So if the data is displayed that implied volatility percentile as toss is about to show, I think in today's option statistics, if it says 26.6, then it's actually still showing us rank.
2778.32s:  Let's take a look.
2782.32s:  So this is showing IV percentile is 27, which is 26.6 rounded. So it is still incorrect.
2788.32s:  They've known that forever. They've literally have just for some reason have opted to not change it.
2794.32s:  It doesn't really matter to me, because I honestly don't use it.
2797.32s:  I use my own calculation for stuff, but yeah, for other people, I could be really misleading. Unfortunately, they don't really care.
2805.32s:  Okay.
2807.32s:  Time for a quiz.
2809.32s:  So what I'm going to do for the quiz is I'm going to create a poll for each one.
2816.32s:  And I need to end the last poll first.
2820.32s:  And I need to create a poll for you. And then you can simply read the question and vote.
2827.32s:  One note that I ask, honestly, I don't even care is I think it would be better.
2835.32s:  If you do not read, look it up, try to Google it, something like that.
2841.32s:  But this is a little tricky because of the text limit.
2857.32s:  Give me one sec.
2859.32s:  I'm going to do these mostly just because of there's a, a text limit.
2866.32s:  Little be all right. What I'll do is I'll prep the other one so that they'll go a little quicker.
2871.32s:  And I think we can only do four options, which is good.
2877.32s:  So the first question is about to come out.
2881.32s:  Start your engines.
2884.32s:  Get ready.
2886.32s:  And go.
2889.32s:  First question is I've.
2894.32s:  So what I'm looking for here is what is the primary function of an exchange.
2899.32s:  And the reason why you need to know this is because this feeds back into understanding the ecosystem
2906.32s:  that we are a part of and what we're doing here.
2913.32s:  You will obviously see some shorthand.
2917.32s:  That is because I run out of space.
2923.32s:  All right, we got 11 votes so far. I'm going to leave it open for just a couple more seconds.
2927.32s:  You're going to have to be fast on these.
2931.32s:  And close.
2937.32s:  All right. So our answers were 87% execute trades between buyers and sellers.
2943.32s:  12% set stock prices.
2946.32s:  Can somebody explain to me why set stock prices is incorrect?
2952.32s:  Why is that one wrong?
2959.32s:  If you will know the answer to that and while you're doing that, guess what?
2962.32s:  Since you boys in ninja, I'm literally going to start prepping the next one so that we we've got to be fast out here.
2971.32s:  Reese says buyers and sellers determine price.
2974.32s:  That's correct.
2975.32s:  So markets are consensus driven.
2980.32s:  If I am a market participants and I see something priced in some type of way.
2988.32s:  And I think it's valued richly or too cheaply.
2992.32s:  I would make a trade based on that.
2994.32s:  So the reason why exchanges don't set prices is because a big part of what markets do is facilitate price discovery, which is exactly what this is.
3004.32s:  So whoever answered set stock prices, totally cool.
3009.32s:  This is you're taking a guess and that's fine.
3012.32s:  I just want to make sure that you're comfortable.
3014.32s:  So if you understand what we just explained beautiful, no need to chime in if you don't want to.
3020.32s:  But if that doesn't make sense, I would love to hear from you and understand why it doesn't make sense to you.
3026.32s:  And in the meantime, next question.
3029.32s:  Come in directly at your face.
3033.32s:  Next pulls up.
3037.32s:  Which.
3040.32s:  Participant acts as a liquidity provider in the market.
3045.32s:  Super easy.
3047.32s:  These are from chat GPT.
3050.32s:  So.
3052.32s:  These should be pretty pretty easy.
3060.32s:  We have 11 votes.
3062.32s:  Give it another couple seconds.
3063.32s:  13 votes.
3064.32s:  Get an itchy finger.
3066.32s:  We about to end it 14 votes.
3069.32s:  And 15 votes, 16 votes.
3072.32s:  Okay, and done.
3076.32s:  Which participant acts as a liquidity provider in markets?
3080.32s:  We have market makers, retail investors, brokers.
3087.32s:  Which one here?
3089.32s:  Would you wager as the most correct answer?
3092.32s:  This is how I emphasize a specific word there.
3095.32s:  Most correct answer.
3098.32s:  Because if we go back that prior slide that we looked at together.
3105.32s:  We'll notice an interesting trend.
3109.32s:  We look at sell side, which we already discussed is liquidity provision.
3114.32s:  We can see exchanges are on this.
3117.32s:  We can see brokers are on this.
3119.32s:  And we can see IBs are on this.
3122.32s:  Technically you can see you could argue either of these as well.
3125.32s:  But.
3128.32s:  The primary provider of liquidity is a market maker.
3132.32s:  That's their primary job.
3134.32s:  Now brokers can provide liquidity.
3136.32s:  They absolutely can.
3137.32s:  They can internalize.
3138.32s:  There's different things that they can do to actually provide liquidity to the market.
3143.32s:  But as we go through some of these questions again, they're from chat GPT.
3146.32s:  But second, you just pick the one that is most correct.
3150.32s:  And definitely that the most correct answer out of that one would be market makers.
3155.32s:  Because that that genuinely is the entire function of a market maker.
3160.32s:  It's what they're meant to do.
3163.32s:  So.
3164.32s:  That is that one.
3166.32s:  All right.
3167.32s:  Next question.
3168.32s:  Being loaded in now.
3170.32s:  This one is another super easy softball question.
3173.32s:  Don't worry because at the end, I have a couple Eric questions to spice these up a little bit.
3179.32s:  The ones from chat GPT are standardized questions just to make you feel better than you probably should before your soul gets crushed on an actual question.
3191.32s:  So just give us a minute here.
3196.32s:  Okay, the next question is which of the following is a derivative?
3202.32s:  Whoever picks stock for the love of God, change your answer.
3207.32s:  Whoever picked ETF for the love of God, change your answer is be correct.
3212.32s:  Don't pick those.
3214.32s:  Do not pick those.
3217.32s:  We have 88% say call option.
3221.32s:  We have 6% to say stocks, 6% to ETF.
3224.32s:  We'll call those as misclicks every once in a while.
3227.32s:  That's probably somebody that's driving will give you the benefit of the doubt there.
3231.32s:  You were going somewhere and you just you misclicked happens to the best of us.
3236.32s:  We all know with certainty that the only thing out of that list that was an actual derivative was the call option.
3245.32s:  The rest of those very clearly very clearly were not derivatives.
3253.32s:  So again, just giving you the benefit of the doubt.
3257.32s:  All right.
3258.32s:  So next, let's get this next question loaded.
3261.32s:  This next one is a little difficult because there's these are slightly longer.
3266.32s:  So I might have to edit some of them.
3268.32s:  Oh, no, we're doing okay.
3270.32s:  All right.
3271.32s:  Two more to drop in.
3273.32s:  And then the next questions come in at your face.
3281.32s:  Okay.
3284.32s:  And this one.
3291.32s:  Next question's up.
3294.32s:  It reads what is a disadvantage for retail traders compared to institutional traders.
3305.32s:  Let's see what you guys think.
3314.32s:  You know, the meantime, this house, New York, Seltzer, water is really good.
3323.32s:  Big fan.
3326.32s:  All right.
3327.32s:  How many do we got 14 votes?
3328.32s:  That's about right.
3329.32s:  And pull.
3332.32s:  And let's see our responses.
3334.32s:  It was 16 votes total.
3336.32s:  43% say higher transaction costs 25% say none of the above access to real time data is 18%.
3343.32s:  And then access or ability to trade pre-market.
3346.32s:  So this one's a shotgun blast.
3347.32s:  This one got you all twisted.
3349.32s:  You all are currently messed up like a football bat.
3353.32s:  So let's work through the wrong ones.
3358.32s:  And we will figure out the correct.
3360.32s:  So what is a disadvantage for retail traders?
3365.32s:  None, none.
3366.32s:  Absolutely not none.
3367.32s:  There's a ton of disadvantages in for retail traders on this list.
3371.32s:  So the way that we can reason through none of the above being wrong is that retail traders have lots of disadvantages and some of them around that list or just wrong.
3381.32s:  The next one.
3384.32s:  Access to real time data.
3388.32s:  Real time data is accessible to retail traders.
3392.32s:  You absolutely have access to that.
3395.32s:  You can you you have the choice to have access to the same data sources that are publicly available.
3402.32s:  Now there's non public available information a little bit different.
3407.32s:  So in terms of real time data you have access to it.
3412.32s:  That does not mean that you have the fastest or optimal access to data for that you do not.
3420.32s:  But you do have access to real time data.
3423.32s:  You can you literally can buy a Bloomberg terminal if you want.
3426.32s:  You can have RTT real time data feeds that provide the same news articles that provide the same announcements that everybody else gets.
3433.32s:  What you're not going to have are the relationships where a buddy will call you and say,
3438.32s:  yo, this is about to happen.
3440.32s:  Unfortunately, that's literally illegal. That's insider information.
3443.32s:  So that does not fit into the mold of available data because it ain't right.
3452.32s:  Okay, so.
3455.32s:  This next one is what there's chat GPT hooked me up with way too many words.
3460.32s:  So I'm just going to.
3463.32s:  I'm just going to ask this next one to you guys because it's too difficult to try and.
3473.32s:  To try and give you the answer, but let's run through the rest of these though ability to trade pre market.
3478.32s:  You also have the ability to trade pre market as a retail trader.
3481.32s:  You absolutely do depends on your broker.
3484.32s:  You can absolutely use a broker that has access to pre market data.
3488.32s:  So moving through process of elimination as per usual, the bulk of people did get this one right 43% were correct.
3494.32s:  It's higher transaction costs. You will always have higher transaction costs.
3498.32s:  Transaction costs are not are not the frontline costs that you see.
3503.32s:  This is one of the things I try to remind traders of all the time transaction costs is not the top line commission that you experience.
3510.32s:  It's the total friction who transact.
3513.32s:  You're always going to be at the tail end of that on the retail side.
3518.32s:  The I think there is a saying that I've heard going around about this.
3523.32s:  What was that saying? Oh, yeah, it's get fucked. That's it.
3527.32s:  That's what's always going to be the case when it comes to transaction costs. So sorry about that.
3532.32s:  Okay, next question.
3535.32s:  I'm just throwing it in the chat because the the responses for the ABCD that chat you be TV gave me were just not happening.
3543.32s:  So this one says.
3545.32s:  Lauren, great question.
3547.32s:  Lauren says, what do you mean friction?
3550.32s:  Friction is an industry term that encompasses the total cost of us to make a trade.
3560.32s:  So for example, when we look at something like placing a trade, you will have an upfront commission.
3570.32s:  Then you might have regulatory fees if you're trading things like futures.
3574.32s:  Then you have the bid ask spread.
3576.32s:  Then you have the fact that your order is probably going to be bundled with other orders to get the best rebates for payment for order flow.
3587.32s:  So you're not getting the best bill you're getting wrapped in a bunch of these different costs before your trade actually gets executed.
3596.32s:  So that's the idea.
3598.32s:  Okay, so the next question here is.
3600.32s:  How does compound interest differ from simple interest?
3604.32s:  Reese says interest on interest completely correct Dylan says growth is geometric instead of linear.
3611.32s:  Yeah.
3613.32s:  I think that that fits because the other thing to note though on simple interest is that it might not even be fully linear.
3622.32s:  Depending on if you're looking at just the interest component versus you know the total value component, but yeah, I totally understand what you're saying.
3630.32s:  And then Matthias says interest makes more money.
3634.32s:  You guys all got that one right.
3635.32s:  I'm glad I did not slave away trying to plug that into the poll function, which is a little bit annoying.
3642.32s:  Okay, perfect.
3643.32s:  You guys know the answer to this one.
3645.32s:  Because we went over most of these.
3648.32s:  That's also the thing that will piss me off the most is if we get a bunch of these wrong, it'll make me mad because we went over specifically all of these.
3660.32s:  And this one.
3667.32s:  Some of them have the letters still involved.
3670.32s:  That doesn't matter.
3671.32s:  Just don't pay attention to the letter.
3672.32s:  I got lazy.
3673.32s:  So the next one says which entity clears and guarantees trades in options.
3679.32s:  Anybody gets this wrong?
3680.32s:  You're fired.
3682.32s:  So we have four votes at OCC so far we have 11% at market maker, which is straight up pissing me off.
3691.32s:  Broker in exchange are rightfully sitting at zero, which is good.
3695.32s:  Do not vote for broker exchange.
3698.32s:  Those are examples of wrong answers.
3700.32s:  And then hint hint for whoever the six percent is notice that 88%.
3710.32s:  They they picked something else and also notice that there's a word called which entity clears and one of these entities has the fucking name in their name.
3726.32s:  We'll just take a take a wild guess here now somebody's just trying to piss me off by picking broker.
3731.32s:  So we know that.
3733.32s:  So I will not fall for your rage bait, but somebody unfortunately did pick market maker a little too fast.
3740.32s:  And whoever picked that.
3745.32s:  You're dead to me because it's just completely wrong and we talked about that explicitly.
3752.32s:  So if that's my boy, Paulo from the very beginning.
3756.32s:  Paulo, if that's you, you're dead to me.
3759.32s:  Just just know if your MR two isn't running again.
3762.32s:  I'm not fixing it done.
3764.32s:  Kill that one.
3766.32s:  All right.
3769.32s:  This is another softball ask question.
3772.32s:  I'm honestly getting a little grumpy here with these softball ask questions coming from chat GPT.
3780.32s:  So let me tell you a story while we're in the fun part of this in the chat GPT prompt.
3788.32s:  I literally told it.
3790.32s:  This is literally what I told it.
3792.32s:  I'm going to read it to you.
3794.32s:  First, this is all of a stuff.
3798.32s:  Third, create a 10 question quiz for the start of the session that recaps the material from the prior session.
3805.32s:  So this is obviously from the session that we covered today.
3808.32s:  Next sentence.
3810.32s:  Ensure the quiz is multiple choice and I don't want to use extremely basic questions.
3820.32s:  Make them moderate difficulty.
3823.32s:  So this is what chat GPT considers moderate difficulty.
3828.32s:  You want to talk about some straight bullshit moderate difficulty.
3833.32s:  This is like play school difficulty.
3836.32s:  This is like if if you're not a complete beginner and you get one of these wrongs wrong just like close the computer and don't come back to this.
3845.32s:  That's where we're at.
3847.32s:  If you're brand new to this and when I say brand new to this if you're like sub year, you're fine.
3851.32s:  You can get all these wrong and I don't care.
3854.32s:  I will still absolutely love to help you.
3857.32s:  You can figure this stuff out because it's confusing in the beginning.
3859.32s:  But if you're over a year getting these wrong.
3863.32s:  Okay, next one.
3866.32s:  Which is not a key component of an option contract.
3872.32s:  Also for the not in anybody tell me what that reference is because that would make me happy.
3881.32s:  If anybody knows what I'm referring to when I say it like that.
3887.32s:  Barat my boy Nate.
3890.32s:  Thank you. This suit is not black.
3893.32s:  This suit is black not.
3897.32s:  All right, we have 18% I'm literally going to pretend that 100% listed the broken name.
3906.32s:  So nice job for 100% of you since everybody clearly knows the answer to that one easy day.
3915.32s:  Oh, this one actually.
3918.32s:  I'm not even going to lie this one like genuinely is a good question.
3921.32s:  I want to I want to know your guys is take on this one as you can tell I didn't vet these.
3925.32s:  If I vet these before I did this, I would have thrown all of these out in scolded chat GPT, which I'm still going to.
3933.32s:  I'm still going to scold chat GPT if I'm being on it.
3936.32s:  Okay, so.
3939.32s:  The next one.
3941.32s:  Don't pay attention if there's a letter there or not.
3944.32s:  I have to take the letters out of some of them because the text string that I can put in for a poll is very, very limited.
3951.32s:  Okay, our next question, which is that's a lie.
3956.32s:  What is an advantage of retail traders smaller position sizes.
3960.32s:  Let me click this open access to leverage high frequency trading capabilities government subsidies.
3972.32s:  Which is an advantage.
3975.32s:  An advantage.
3978.32s:  Who the fuck is putting high frequency trading capabilities?
3985.32s:  How does that make any sense to you whatsoever?
3990.32s:  How does high frequency are you a high frequency trading firm?
3994.32s:  Are you the firm that's literally named after this thing?
4000.32s:  Let's go back to this.
4003.32s:  Retail right here.
4005.32s:  That's you right there.
4007.32s:  There's literally an entire business sector for high frequency trading firms.
4020.32s:  Government subsidies is actually an interesting one.
4022.32s:  I'm not going to lie.
4025.32s:  Okay, so we can end this before I end myself looking at some of these answers.
4031.32s:  And we'll go through them.
4034.32s:  Yeah.
4036.32s:  There's only two in here that I would give credit for it.
4043.32s:  And again, if we're trying to answer this in the standard test taking approach of which one is most correct, then again,
4052.32s:  if we're going to give credit for the high frequency trading, then we're going to give credit for the high frequency trading.
4058.32s:  So the question was what is an advantage of retail traders smaller position sizes, high frequency trading capabilities access to leverage government subsidies.
4066.32s:  Let's go through the wrong ones.
4069.32s:  First, I already think high frequency trading capabilities.
4073.32s:  That's point is already been made access to leverage.
4077.32s:  And back to 2008.
4081.32s:  Who caused the crisis in 2008?
4088.32s:  Was it retail traders who were disgustingly over levered in subprime mortgages that they were bundling together into mortgage back securities and trading them amongst one another like an insesituous pool?
4104.32s:  Is that was it retail who caused that?
4108.32s:  Because what I can promise you is the entity that did cause that absolutely had access to tons of leverage more leverage than you could fucking wrap your arms around.
4124.32s:  So it's not that one.
4127.32s:  Government subsidies is the only other one that I would even consider.
4132.32s:  But again, I would not consider it if we're trying to answer this in the context of which one is most correct.
4141.32s:  The only reason, the only reason why I could reasonably think about government subsidies here is that if you elect to be a day trader in market.
4155.32s:  If you make that election, then the government is kind of subsidizing.
4162.32s:  But it's not a government subsidy.
4165.32s:  Like it's a big stretch to make that argument.
4168.32s:  Like you're not really getting any sort of reward.
4171.32s:  You're just being able to actually write off what you're doing.
4175.32s:  And you're able to use your full losses in a single year.
4178.32s:  Like that's it.
4179.32s:  It's not really a subsidy.
4181.32s:  So again, it's a big stretch.
4183.32s:  I could see a tiny sliver of that answer.
4186.32s:  But hands down the correct answer there is smaller position sizes.
4191.32s:  The reason why smaller position sizes are so important is because if you want to place max trade size in something like T triple cues, you can.
4198.32s:  If you want to place max trade size in an option on T triple cues, you can you move the market a little bit, but you can.
4204.32s:  This is why dark pools exist.
4207.32s:  They sound way more nefarious than they are, but they genuinely are kind of needed.
4212.32s:  Because for those that it's it's time we've gotten through how long we've been going in hour and seven minutes, which fun fact I really had zero game plan for this session.
4223.32s:  So I hope it's been good.
4224.32s:  I created a loose agenda, but I spent exactly zero time thinking about what I was actually going to talk about.
4230.32s:  So.
4233.32s:  And you can tell I didn't think about it because I obviously would have wrote in way more time for drawing.
4238.32s:  So let's talk about institution here.
4242.32s:  I'm actually going to make the whole thing blurry.
4244.32s:  I don't know if this is going to screw up the vision for you guys at all, but I think it might be useful.
4251.32s:  Hold on. There's one of these that.
4253.32s:  One of these is that maybe this one.
4256.32s:  I can't see shit.
4258.32s:  Let me know hold on. Let me undo that.
4260.32s:  Can you guys see when I do that?
4262.32s:  Is it if you can that I can just draw on it without seeing anything, but I can see shit when I click that.
4268.32s:  When it's like super blurry for everything is it.
4271.32s:  Can you guys still see the stream and that stuff when I do that?
4275.32s:  Makes you feel drunk.
4278.32s:  Okay, then.
4280.32s:  We're not trying to I'm not trying to cause a relapse.
4283.32s:  We'll just switch over and we'll go into our handy Andy workbook.
4291.32s:  This one.
4293.32s:  And we'll go to a scratch tab.
4296.32s:  Okay.
4298.32s:  Get rid of this.
4300.32s:  This scratch tab is just starting to turn into sense.
4305.32s:  Literally not.
4307.32s:  Okay.
4308.32s:  So now.
4310.32s:  Let's draw.
4313.32s:  Instead of less dance, whatever that that dancing meme, what let's dance like fuck that.
4325.32s:  Let's draw.
4326.32s:  Okay.
4327.32s:  So here we have a institution.
4332.32s:  And the institution on this side has one constituent that works for them.
4343.32s:  It's this person right here.
4345.32s:  And in this world, they do have a giant iced out chain.
4351.32s:  And let's say that it has ticker symbols like some of the favorite ticker symbols like so far.
4359.32s:  Maybe serve.
4364.32s:  What's another ticker symbol for this probably game stop.
4370.32s:  So we're all blinged out.
4372.32s:  This is the institution.
4374.32s:  And for those that don't know this is well, you guys already know who this is.
4379.32s:  I don't even have to write the name.
4380.32s:  You already know.
4381.32s:  I'm not going to bother.
4382.32s:  And they're blinged out.
4383.32s:  They have an iced out necklace.
4386.32s:  There's no top hat or anything like that in this one.
4389.32s:  And the institution has a lot of money.
4393.32s:  And so they over the time of making little tiny baby trades that eventually stack up, they've created a mountain of money.
4405.32s:  Some of it apparently has some issues where it's like misshapen.
4409.32s:  I don't know why I keep doing that.
4411.32s:  It makes me a little nervous about the way that my brain is working right now.
4415.32s:  This way it makes more sense to me.
4418.32s:  They have a stack of money that goes up to the ceiling, big stack of money.
4423.32s:  And what they do is they say.
4427.32s:  Yo.
4430.32s:  Big dog.
4436.32s:  I'm a buy.
4440.32s:  I'm so.
4445.32s:  And.
4448.32s:  Actually.
4452.32s:  Hold.
4455.32s:  That shit.
4459.32s:  So.
4460.32s:  This is the this is just a direct quote from Lauren.
4463.32s:  I've heard her mentioned this a couple times.
4465.32s:  So Lauren says, Yo big dog.
4466.32s:  I'm a buy some so if I actually hold that shit.
4469.32s:  And that's the game plan.
4471.32s:  But Lauren in this instance has lots and lots of money.
4476.32s:  So Lauren is the broker says.
4482.32s:  Hello.
4484.32s:  Ma'am.
4487.32s:  How.
4489.32s:  Much.
4492.32s:  Don't buy.
4494.32s:  Please.
4497.32s:  I'm a broker.
4500.32s:  And the broker is probably like a fat.
4505.32s:  Misshapen.
4506.32s:  That's not the head by the way.
4508.32s:  That's the that's the body like this fat.
4511.32s:  Except that's wrong.
4512.32s:  That's wrong.
4513.32s:  Because their fat would be like the droopy disgusting fat like this.
4517.32s:  Like to cellulate.
4518.32s:  Layton fat.
4519.32s:  It's not like the construction worker fat that just has like a really rotund stomach.
4523.32s:  Not like that fat.
4524.32s:  This is like the and they have like a little tiny arms like a little fucking critter.
4529.32s:  So the broker says, Hello, ma'am.
4532.32s:  How much so five please rights are all proper and lame.
4536.32s:  So then Lauren.
4538.32s:  Comes back and hits them and they're like.
4543.32s:  Big pimping.
4550.32s:  Hit.
4551.32s:  You girl.
4554.32s:  With 100.
4557.32s:  Millie.
4559.32s:  So now.
4561.32s:  Lauren comes back and says, Yo, big pimping.
4565.32s:  Hit your girl with 100 million.
4567.32s:  This entire thing in case you didn't remember is about dark pools.
4572.32s:  It's it's obviously also about my fantastic artwork, but it's about dark pools.
4576.32s:  And here's what happens.
4579.32s:  And to get hopefully educational for a second joking aside.
4584.32s:  If Lauren tried to take this 100 million dollar order and she tried to go to the open market.
4593.32s:  This 100 million dollar order would represent a significant amount of the actual deal flow of of a day of.
4603.32s:  So five let's take a look at an example.
4605.32s:  I actually don't know the answer and I'll figure it out with you really quick.
4608.32s:  So let's go to so five.
4611.32s:  And the last volume is 28.7 at 14.55, which is the stock price 20 28.71.
4621.32s:  So let's take a quick look at this.
4624.32s:  28.712123.
4627.32s:  So this is the total volume that it ran.
4631.32s:  Let's just call it like 14 I think was 17 or something, but which is called like 14 15 because I'm simple brain.
4638.32s:  And let's do the math here this times this it tells us it tells us the total dollar volume that it moved on the day.
4645.32s:  So this is 406 million dollars.
4652.32s:  In our example that we just came up with together here.
4656.32s:  A single entity, a single baller out here named Lauren is trying to move 100 million.
4666.32s:  It's a fourth of the total volume that this experienced over the course of a day.
4672.32s:  So here's what happens if she tries to go to the open market with this at one fourth of the total size.
4680.32s:  What ends up happening I just completely messed up spelling total.
4684.32s:  What ends up happening is as she starts entering her order right so she sends $100,000.
4691.32s:  Then she does another $100,000.
4693.32s:  Then she does another $100,000.
4695.32s:  And then she does $500,000 and so on and so forth.
4698.32s:  As this is happening, people like me see it.
4701.32s:  People like high frequency trading traders see it.
4703.32s:  People like a prop firms can see it.
4706.32s:  And what we start doing is we front run the move.
4709.32s:  We're like, oh shit, there's a big, big, big order coming through.
4714.32s:  Let me jump in and start bidding this up because I don't know when the party's going to stop.
4720.32s:  But there's a party going on right now.
4722.32s:  So now as she's trying to fill this order, there's other entities, greedy people or just people that are trying to play the market movement that are also starting to get into this order flow.
4735.32s:  So it bids up the price massively for her on top of her bidding up the price for herself.
4744.32s:  Big, big deal.
4747.32s:  Michael says markets are crashing.
4749.32s:  What are you talking about?
4751.32s:  Markets are down less than half a point.
4754.32s:  Don't come in here with that nonsense.
4756.32s:  We're not trying to have a deranged Kathy that needs something down half a point.
4764.32s:  Anyways, Kathy's aside.
4767.32s:  This is a problem.
4768.32s:  This is a problem if you're trying to provide an actual fill at a reasonable price for something.
4776.32s:  So this is the advent of dark pools, which sound so much more nefarious than they are.
4784.32s:  Now, I want to be clear.
4785.32s:  I'm not advocating for against dark pools.
4787.32s:  I'm really not, but I can objectively analyze their utility.
4791.32s:  This is one of the things that retail traders honestly suck at is objective analysis of stuff.
4796.32s:  If something is perceived as being not beneficial to me, Eric, the trader, I don't like it.
4801.32s:  I talk shit about it, but there is a really, really important need for us to be able to look at something and objectively try to analyze it.
4815.32s:  So in this context, I can get into this trade and front run the rest of the order flow.
4822.32s:  If I'm seeing it being bid hit at the offer and bid up over and over again, I can get involved and move with the order flow that I'm expecting to continue to some degree.
4834.32s:  The purpose of dark pools is Lauren instead can come meet with a few people in this meeting typically happens over the phone and stuff like that.
4845.32s:  That person has a silly look and face and Lauren simply says, I want to move 100 million.
4851.32s:  And this person says, OK, well, I'm trying to move 50 mill.
4856.32s:  This person says, I'm trying to move 25 mill. And then Lauren's like, OK, well, I'm a little bit short.
4861.32s:  Do you guys know anybody or maybe I can cut my trade down?
4864.32s:  Lauren's like, no, I got to fill this whole thing. Then they'll call a friend. Maybe they'll hit up a broker, whatever it is.
4869.32s:  And they'll find somebody else that's like, OK, well, I could do 25 mill. And what they do is they'll agree on a price.
4875.32s:  This person will say, I'll do it at 1449. This person says, I'll do it at because it's less.
4883.32s:  I'll do it at 1455. And this person says, I'll do it at 1448, whatever it is.
4888.32s:  And this order then can be filled. Now, one of the things that people do not understand, I see it as a really, really common misunderstanding in the game stop community specifically.
4898.32s:  Because I spent a lot of time analyzing game stop and working alongside the apes is orders that are filled in a dark pool still hit the consolidated tape.
4911.32s:  There's still there. There's literally a slight delay typically. It's not even that long of a delay. It's several seconds, not long.
4917.32s:  So it's still AIDS price discovery. It's still AIDS consensus driven pricing. It's not a significant attractor to any of that stuff.
4927.32s:  Again, from an objective standpoint, it does absolutely slow price discovery. There's no debate about it.
4932.32s:  But the price discovery is going to be slowed anyways by people trying to frontrun the order anyways.
4940.32s:  So it's just a way for larger institutions to be able to transact and actually get full fills on orders without moving the markets on them.
4950.32s:  So that is that in a nutshell. I don't remember how many questions we've done so far. Let me take a look at what's left.
4958.32s:  And because I want to make sure that we have at least because we're already we have like 10 minutes left.
4963.32s:  There's two more questions. Let's run through these two questions really quick.
4966.32s:  And then we'll get into just general open Q&A for anything else that that you want to hit.
4972.32s:  So the next question is what's the main purpose of options?
4979.32s:  We have speculation, hedging and leverage earnings, earning dividends and none of the above.
4989.32s:  All right. We have nine votes. That's plenty, especially because we already had some people going off the beaten path and hedging and leverage.
4999.32s:  Then none of the above. So for somebody that's answered hedging and leverage, why would you disprove or how would you disprove the answer of none of the above.
5012.32s:  And then this next one is actually kind of interesting to be honest because we didn't talk about this yet, but chat GPT probably went through my deck because I uploaded it.
5022.32s:  So it's grabbing this from a little bit later. And I still think it's a completely fine question. So I'm going to ask this one.
5031.32s:  But I want to get an answer to the last one. So for somebody that answered hedging and leverage, why how would you explain that none of the above is wrong.
5039.32s:  Because obviously none of the above is wrong. And while you're explaining that, I'm a I'm a hit up the old the old chat.
5047.32s:  And I'm going to see if Mel is in a dinner preferences because you guys you have no idea what I did to Thor.
5054.32s:  I brought him to the groomer today. And whenever I bring him to the groomer, my my it's not even a guilty pleasure. It is a completely unshamed shameless, completely shameless pleasure with Thor is I like to have them give him the most rid.
5076.32s:  Ridiculous haircuts. And then poor Mel just has to kind of tolerate it because I you know, I always maintain the argument. I'm the one that brings them. So I'm the one that gets to tell them what what to do.
5087.32s:  So I I gave him what I consider to be the piece to La Raza stance like it's a masterpiece. He looks so ridiculous. So anyways, I'm going to see what Mel wants for dinner versus telling her what I'm going to get because I feel a little bad.
5104.32s:  And I also don't want to end up dead in my sleep tonight. So yeah, he looks he looks ridiculous. It's most excellent.
5114.32s:  Lauren says now we need to see Thor you will I'll definitely bring them in before before we wrap up for sure.
5119.32s:  A Reese says they're leveraged because they're cheaper than a hundred shares with the same exposure and can be used to offload risk put by.
5126.32s:  Yeah, I think that's a reasonable simplistic explanation. The reason why none of the above is wrong is because literally the primary purpose of options is to provide hedging.
5140.32s:  That's the that's the general reason why they were invented and then speculation came up came on after that.
5148.32s:  So leverage is an element of it, but options can be used to speculate and the reason why we use it to speculate is because it provides things like leverage and options allow you to control a larger some of money with less money, whether you buy yourself doesn't matter.
5167.32s:  Last question and then we'll get into the open Q&A. So for the open Q&A start thinking about whatever you want to talk about doesn't even have to be related to what we covered tonight. It can be it cannot be.
5178.32s:  But the last question we have is how can a trader mitigate cognitive biases this one super super easy and.
5186.32s:  It's very clear that I'm actually glad because what I did for chat GPT is I uploaded the that big ugly PowerPoint deck that I reference when we go through a lot of these and I had it create a series of quiz questions off of it.
5201.32s:  So yeah, I really, really like.
5205.32s:  That it asked that and you guys are correct it's essentially the way we mitigate cognitive biases first is by being aware of the cognitive bias that really is a big step because it's very difficult to fix problems that you don't that you don't know where you don't acknowledge exist makes it really, really difficult to solve for.
5227.32s:  And then after that it is the way that we think about things we understand our natural human in eight biases and beyond that we can control for it the way we can control for it is then by identifying what it is.
5249.32s:  So yeah, overall I hope that the quiz was good for you before we get into the open Q&A I do have a couple questions for you the first question I have is how how was the first session did the material makes sense did we move at the correct pace was it the right kind of stuff again this one's more so designed for recap.
5274.32s:  So that's mostly what I was trying to hit for it but as per always I really am interested in trying to do a good job for you guys so I would love just your general feedback on what we talked about if it was good okay cool so generally seems to be okay and then obviously if you didn't like it then I then I hate you and I'm not I don't want to hear about it so it's really a blank quite obviously I'm joking if if there's stuff we can do better I want to know but I still will hate you and not let.
5304.32s:  So let's go with it pretty much forever just.
5308.32s:  Okay so now let's move into open Q&A so I'm going to try to catch up through some of the chat and see what you guys were dropping in if there's anything that you specifically want me to discuss take a look at now is a perfect time to do so you can grab any of your comments from before that I didn't get to and you can just bump up to the front and then I'll be able to take a peek through it so.
5334.32s:  Let's see what pops out to my eyes um let me see.
5345.32s:  Stelio says dumb question but how does ix operate different than other exchanges that's a great question um.
5354.32s:  Mark says they hit the other exchanges at the same time to prevent front running read flash boys yeah so I mean they do a lot more than that though so what they do is they use a specific delay they call it if i'm not mistaken a speed bump and the whole purpose of a speed bump is to slow down the ability for high for we can sort traders.
5384.32s:  To interact so a big a big goal for something like ix is to neutralize some of the methodologies of.
5394.32s:  I've got the traders but they also they don't use any rebates they really focus on best execution they're way more transparent so they're essentially in exchange that highly values.
5408.32s:  Transparency and then trying to execute is fairly as possible so really really really really great question.
5417.32s:  James says when someone says something as an IV of xyz does that always have an expiration attached to it by default negative that's a great question so in general when people are referring to the.
5430.32s:  IV of a ticker they're typically referring to the ticker for the underlying itself which that is an annualized deviation so what that means is let me get rid of this drawing tool it messes up some of the other commands that whoa.
5447.32s:  Don't want that there we go so if somebody says for example so far as an implied volatility of 78.6% that's an annualized expected deviation one standard deviation move so that's for the underlying itself then when we're talking about individual explorations that's when we're talking about expiration specific.
5473.32s:  My boy Paulo says when you free to meet up honestly kind of whenever to be honest yeah whenever whenever you're free dude you you work way more strict hours than I do TBH so if you let me know.
5489.32s:  I'm totally down to meet up I can finally like sit down for a little bit now I was actually just driving the Corvette today when I went to go pick Thorup and the poor Corvette continues to ask me for windshield fluid which is so funny because I literally removed the washer fluid a tank so I could put more parts in the car space becomes a premium so.
5518.32s:  Yeah literally whenever cool let me see what else.
5526.32s:  Mark says never heard front running using that context have you read flash boys yeah definitely so flash boys also is a little bit of older older extraction of high for because you trading but yeah there's I think that's a great foundational book but front running is a really flexible.
5547.32s:  Concept that genuinely applies to a ton of things because the concept of front running is just where we for whatever reason are able to navigate in front of something before a move then happens so like really great example of this literally joking aside but with all of the trading that's done by people like Nancy Pelosi as we like to call out specifically but also all of those styles of entities all of the
5576.32s:  congressional traders and stuff like that most of them have some sort of insider information and they absolutely will will act on that insider information so that's an example of front running a move it's definitely not limited to high for
5594.32s:  trading in any way there's obviously use in high for just a trading but in no way limited to it.
5602.32s:  And then Stephanie says I want to use Python a monitor price movements and set alerts I need a service of which I can make API calls against I feel like there's more to that.
5614.32s:  Stephanie if you read if you repost or quite I just didn't see the the whole series of questions like the basis of it so I just I need the rest of the context.
5633.32s:  Mark says it's how Cohen made his billions and why I exist is why Citadel worth the microwave front running other hedges is that how Cohen made his billions I did I actually didn't know that I thought he made it through like his pet smart or whatever the company here in let's see how did Cohen make his money.
5657.32s:  He began his career working as a trader for gruntle and co which I know that he had substantial returns for the investors for himself.
5668.32s:  Mark says not Ryan oh okay sorry sorry sorry yeah it's tricky when there's two coins that we refer to yeah okay now I'm following yeah from 0.72 that's blue different I follow now thanks.
5683.32s:  Yeah sorry I was misunderstanding I'm so used to referring to RC at this point.
5692.32s:  Cool alright so now let's talk about your homework so what time is it's 1 35 oh oh we have homework what I'm doing for this is you guys know for the live streams I'm actually opening up a text doc.
5709.32s:  So that I can take really loose time stamps for people when they want to rewatch things I'm not like doing each item or anything like that but yeah I'm trying to make it easier for you guys to rewatch their stuff so let's take a look at our homework again this is generated from chat GPT so I'm going to see if I like it or not or if we need to modify it so this is it's too long to post in once which is kind of a lot of time.
5739.32s:  So this is the first part that's the second part so let's see research and list the top five options exchanges globally noting their unique feature I like that identify three advantages and disadvantages retail retail traders face against this
5759.32s:  Calculate compound interest on a hypothetical $10,000 portfolio with 10% annual return over 10 20 30 years with them without additional 1000 per month safety I love that one and this one I actually added I remember this one this with them without an additional 1000 saved so I love that yeah that's solid solid homework for the compound interest thing you guys already know you can use the website that has that built for you and those others I actually think are pretty decent so we will
5789.32s:  we will review those at the beginning of the next session and then we will explore the next series of stuff what is the next series of stuff that we have let's take a look so for those that are curious what the next series is going to be for the next episode
5820.32s:  We have I guess we kind of already went over most of it so I'm going to change these this one I think we're going to do this one we're going to change this we're going to do option
5839.32s:  pricing I think that's a really really important one so we'll do that one next and then actually that's a lie so I got it now
5855.32s:  here's what it's going to be so this this is done this one I want to do option pricing so this will be pricing settlement decisions so settlement decisions explicitly I want to walk us through when and why we close options so when and why we close option when why and how
5885.32s:  and this I think is really important because it will help us get a little bit more close to the decision people make when they're closing trades then I'm actually going to move this up
5906.32s:  because I think I want to make sure that you all are starting this process as soon as humanly possible then we will talk about the Greeks this makes sense here to me this kind of analysis this all makes sense to me I think all of this
5923.32s:  days in the correct order and then we have a couple like sessions the purpose of the flex sessions is I'm literally going to use those to help us get a little dialed in on anything that is of particular interest to us so that's why you see that here and it'll probably be built up realistically as we move through this I like I don't expect those flex sessions to remain there but
5953.32s:  I like to have a couple things built for us in the beginning and then leave a little room for us to explore a little bit because based on how the group works the overall level understanding of things that all help me a lot and I actually have one follow on pole for you guys because I started with how many have been trading for less than a year and it was a little over than 50% so if you've been trading for less than
5981.32s:  less than one year along so let's do less than three months do three to six months we'll do three to five months and then we'll do six months plus so this is specifically for the people that have been trading for less than one year
6007.32s:  for the less than one year group how long in there and then it looks like we're all caught up on the questions which is perfect.
6023.32s:  Oh yeah, but I think we're in a good spot.
6027.32s:  I am probably going to run through a little bit of the portfolio now this is not tied to this session at all so for anybody that's specifically interested in the options one of one series to begin or series perfect time to click off and then for those that are just looking for general market update stuff that's what I'm going to do now mostly for me but I'm not going to do that.
6052.32s:  We can do that together just because it's what I'm going to do anyway.
6059.32s:  It makes no difference me so let's take a quick peek.
6067.32s:  Let me and then oh yeah sorry one more quick admin note for those that are trying to follow along with this that are trying to figure out what the homework is and stuff like that you can find all this on the website.
6081.32s:  So if you go to here options trading guide this Excel sheet or Google sheet is starting to become a general resource for everybody and again the reason why it looks like this is because I optimized it just for mobile and I'm not smart enough to figure out how to do the desktop and mobile version I'm pretty not
6100.32s:  adapted this but down at the bottom you can see there is the outlier options trading basic syllabus which is here so you will be able to run through and grab all of the stuff that you would like.
6117.32s:  So that's what we got for the session today beautiful and now I'm going to just run through the market.
6129.32s:  So let's see what we got for the first one 42 06 so be stock market.
6137.32s:  All right first let's see any news.
6146.32s:  Nothing in here sticking out to me the wildfires here have been absolutely.
6158.32s:  So we're going to have to pick it and go somewhere else either tomorrow the next day but we just kind of like bouncing around we're actually going to go I forgot the place in Washington what is the name of it was.
6187.32s:  10 11 worth this is where we're going so we're definitely going to try to go to 11 what the that's freaky we're going to go here because apparently it's like a really cool winter town that's the word on the show.
6210.32s:  So yeah we're going to go check out this place and that will be a little bit later this month.
6219.32s:  It looks kind of cool so that's that let's get back to this recess jobs tomorrow morning with out looking I can't remember CPI PPI or employment yeah there's a couple things.
6233.32s:  So there's nothing in here that's really sticking out to me let's run through the actual calendar.
6240.32s:  See what that is.
6244.32s:  The tent we have.
6251.32s:  OPEC building permits CPI CPI will be a pretty big deal Michigan sentiment that'll be a big deal to that balance sheet so tomorrow actually be a little bit busy I think I'm already all wow RGTI down 45% wow I didn't realize they got cracked that hard.
6278.32s:  Cupid's down 43 I on cue down 39 QBTS down 36.
6286.32s:  Holy shit so those ones we're going to need a bunch of alerts on let's take a look at the watch list really quick want to make sure that all of those are in here.

6322.32s:  RGTI.
6328.32s:  Lauren says good time to buy actually a fair question joking aside but this is not at all where I would be a buyer at all this if you're an investor I think this becomes a little bit more interesting but yeah I think this is a
6349.32s:  bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of

6394.32s:  For some sort offast br toward toad, Gudd, Gudd.
6398.04s:  a short that I closed most of it out here, but I still have a little bit of a lingering short
6405.24s:  to continue just right in the down move. Funny enough, that was actually partly due to the
6411.64s:  analysis that we did together about just the accuracy of Hindenburg research, which tends to be
6419.72s:  pretty accurate. So I pruned a position to just see not a whole lot, figured why not do it. So
6433.08s:  that's been fine so far, but the stop out now is just back at breakeven for the remaining part
6440.60s:  of the position I just did long puts. Ready. Let's see.
6449.96s:  Ready to still look super strong. Ready to look really, really good.
6456.44s:  One of the more resilient names so far. Yeah, I got a ton of stuff.
6465.00s:  I got a ton of stuff to go over during the stream tomorrow. So and I guess the last thing I'll
6474.68s:  I'll wrap up with is there is a new stream schedule for everybody's awareness. So Monday, Wednesday,
6484.04s:  Friday is the pro streams Tuesday Thursday, standard YouTube market streams Thursday is going to be
6491.48s:  outlier options trading basics. So Tuesday will be the primary just general stream. And then
6496.68s:  Saturday still game stop. Sunday will be more ad hoc. I'm actually expecting to take that day back
6502.20s:  and start using it for more content production for the week. So that's the game plan. But as always,
6508.04s:  we'll we'll see how it goes for everybody's general awareness. But that about wraps me up. I'm going
6514.52s:  to hop off actually work on another video now. And I will see you all on the next one. Be an outlier.
6521.88s:  See y'all later.
