0.00s: What's up, Alleyers?
1.70s: Take a trip with me to 4 November 2025.
5.54s: I want to walk you through a recent trade in RGTI and give you a walkthrough of what this thing was.
14.96s: What happened, why I did, what I did, we actually just did a deep dive for like 90 minutes
23.10s: on trade management in the outlier pro community.
26.74s: This is actually a good example, I think, to talk about some of the most important concepts
31.46s: of trade management in the broader context of natural trade and a trade review.
37.18s: So one of the strategies in my stable is breakdowns.
43.18s: What I'm typically looking for in these are things that have some sort of downside
49.70s: velocity can often be caused by post earnings move, stuff like that.
55.10s: But in this case, there was some really interesting behavior in RGTI.
62.26s: So again, this is back in 4 November and I want to show you a few things.
66.50s: The first thing is if we take a look at this move here, this move is like over 275%
74.30s: and like five trading weeks.
76.70s: Now underlines can have that kind of move, just because it went up a lot doesn't mean
81.10s: it's going to come down.
83.18s: It does mean I'm going to watch the move either for an upside player, a downside play.
89.06s: So one of the key things that I look for is consistency through a consolidation and how it behaves.
97.06s: A good example of a consolidation is this little zone right here.
100.74s: You can see very, very clearly that price has this leg up.
106.34s: It starts to digest the consolidate sideways during this consolidation very, very frequently.
112.70s: You will find that the bodies of the candles will get real, real small.
118.02s: That's volatility coming down.
120.46s: And then sometimes there will be a more aggressive style move up and out.
126.50s: This would be a break out.
128.34s: So this is an upside breakout.
130.78s: If we take a look at how price behaved during this breakout,
135.50s: broke out saw this individual chopping up.
141.02s: And what I mean by that is it wasn't really run inside ways.
145.02s: This was just absolutely running to the upside day over day.
149.90s: Even on the day that it was down up here, still maintains in upside trend.
157.66s: It then has this really aggressive continuation of the move.
161.34s: We see this red day and then we see this red day.
164.74s: This is where I'm starting to look or how does it behave.
168.58s: If it's going to behave normally for something that's going to continue in aggressive climb,
172.98s: I would expect to see it oscillate sideways like here and then move up.
179.86s: If not, then I pay attention.
182.58s: And I see how it behaves during these down moves.
186.82s: One of the things that I thought was really pertinent here is the fact that prior to all of this,
193.86s: it didn't really have much of a consolidation in there.
196.74s: So what I'm doing is I'm seeing where it is price start to grab a foothold.
201.38s: So we get this pretty aggressive move down.
203.70s: This would have been a completely viable spot or this to enter to the downside.
208.26s: I just hadn't.
209.78s: And it consolidates sideways.
213.22s: Then we see this red day and this beginning of a gap down that's rallinging that
220.98s: towards the end of this day actually got even weaker.
224.42s: So if I fast forward us to 1230 Pacific time, you'll see what I'm talking about.
228.58s: You see how it a little bit weaker on the day.
230.34s: It was accelerating down.
232.34s: This is where I entered.
234.50s: And the trade was in RGTI.
238.50s: This was an opportunity driven trade.
240.82s: What I mean by that is I didn't have some sort of specific portfolio need.
247.30s: Although I did generally want to find some short delta's,
251.30s: which is why I was looking for downside stuff, but it wasn't like an imperative.
255.46s: It is actually pretty okay.
258.26s: And the broader profit mechanism here, I just outlined for you, is breakdowns.
264.42s: And this is a near term driven price behavior.
268.66s: I already gave you an overview of some of the signals that I was using to measure.
273.62s: But that's essentially price volume moving averages and analyzing those in combination with one another.
282.82s: That led to this entry on four November when the underlying was at like 3577,
288.98s: I bought to open 95 of the 30 puts for $4.15.
294.74s: Now this trade was put on for a couple different reasons.
298.98s: The main thing is I wanted downside and I wanted to play it to the downside.
303.22s: But I actually wanted to put the position on in larger size.
306.98s: This is well less the total debit here was well less than one percent of the account.
312.18s: I was limited by liquidity.
313.94s: The market there as I was getting my orders through was starting to oscillate wide now.
321.78s: And in something like this, that can actually be a little bit of a Debbie Downer.
325.62s: And it's a reality, not even when you're trading like big sizes,
328.82s: like this is a moderate size trade.
330.82s: But even this becomes a little prohibitive as that spread wide is out.
335.78s: So the total size here is well within risk tolerance of the portfolio.
340.74s: But nonetheless, I don't define the risk in the trade by the size.
344.90s: I define it by where I'm going to manage it in this context, which is based on the stop.
349.94s: The spot that I was expecting to start scaling out is around in here, like this 43 and a quarter.
357.54s: This is what I consider a soft stop.
360.26s: This is where if there's not some sort of very specific reason for me to get out,
365.14s: I intend to get out.
366.74s: And the hard stop is effectively right above these highs.
370.82s: So it would have been right around like 44 or 75 something like that.
375.14s: But the way that I treat soft stop hard stop is really, really simple.
379.38s: The soft stop 85, 90 percent of the time I'm going to get out at that point.
383.70s: Unless there's a very strong reason for me to stay in.
386.10s: If you're a newer trader, you kind of have to avoid that because newer traders are really susceptible
391.30s: to this idea of the disposition effect, which is letting losers run too much.
395.54s: You want to avoid that.
398.26s: Now let's fast forward to 21 November.
402.90s: Over this time frame, I'll give you like a couple snap shots all fast forward like a week and a half.
407.70s: And I'll give you a quick play like play on what went down.
410.90s: So this is the day that I got in and it started a small little consolidation and then was
416.98s: gapping down, gapping down.
419.22s: All I'm doing in here is slowly starting to slide the metrics of the trade down.
424.82s: So what that looks like is the original hard stop is up here.
428.18s: The soft stop is in here.
430.34s: I just take those down here.
432.98s: And what I'm doing is I'm decreasing the total risk of the trade,
437.38s: but allowing it to stay on.
439.70s: Sometimes when stuff is moving like this, if the trade was at full size,
443.94s: I would have taken a partial profit, but because the trade wasn't at full size,
449.30s: it didn't make sense for me to take any sort of partial profit in it so far.
454.26s: But that's another way that I would manage specifically for this profit mechanism of breakdowns.
460.18s: We get this move to the downside and what I start asking myself is like, where is price likely to go?
466.58s: And we get through this consolidation right here at this point.
471.86s: There's a tiny little bit here, but not much at all.
474.98s: I wouldn't consider this a consolidation at all.
477.70s: So the next real spot that right now it looks like, which again, is on the 14th of
482.10s: November, is like in here.
483.62s: Let's fast forward another week really quick.
487.62s: And we'll go to the 21st November.
490.50s: You can see now that price started to build out a consolidation zone,
495.14s: actually in here.
497.22s: So now there's a new volume note emerging and the game becomes either I'm going to be wrong
504.02s: with a break above this new consolidation or it's going to be game on to the downside.
509.62s: If we get a downside continuation, which it started to look like it was going to run that direction.
516.42s: Now if we take a look at the 24th of November,
519.54s: you'll see that we start actually running the other direction.
525.86s: So this consolidation is now gone on for eight days.
530.26s: A little bit sloppy of a consolidation with the range, but still broadly there within kind of like this
535.46s: 23 and a half up to the 27.
538.66s: And this near term strength signals to me that something is going on.
544.50s: So what I do at this point is actually close most of the trade.
549.94s: It take down about 85%.
553.14s: And I close those for $6.90.
557.22s: The total credit on those is about 55k and the realized P&L is 22k.
563.38s: I want to be very specific around the metrics here.
566.58s: The reason why I took down what I did was partially because these options
573.54s: are losing money through theta and decreasing volume as this is going on.
578.90s: So my thesis is still intact, but time is passing.
584.02s: That's the first factor. Now what I'm not doing is saying like, oh, let me leave a little bit on
592.18s: so that this is how smarty and then I'll just let it go.
596.26s: That's not how I trade at all. To me it actually makes no sense to do that because how
601.54s: money in this context is my money. I otherwise could have closed these these 15 for $6.90
609.94s: since as well. I could have made way more money on these, but I chose not to because I wanted to see
617.70s: if we get a continuation or if we end up moving in the wrong direction and I eventually have to get
625.54s: stopped out. But my stop doesn't move at this point and it's just a waiting game. My settle
630.82s: and monitor how this thing is going to behave. I'm going to come out of on demand now because
636.10s: actually the trade came down today on the 4th of December on this candle.
641.22s: We were previously looking in here and I continue to trend sideways. Then we see this very,
647.78s: very clear upside move and that's exactly where the rest of the trade comes down.
653.70s: So I take down the remaining 15 contracts. I realize a P&L of 435 bucks. None of that matters.
661.94s: The dollars for this individual trade don't matter. What I'm doing is I'm figuring out where I want
669.14s: to start scaling out where I want to take profit or loss is based on my thesis and it's based
676.26s: on the specific strategy. That's why I write strategy outlines that are very defined
682.82s: I scope out what I'm trading so that I can come up with ideas because this specific strategy for
688.10s: example has a win rate anywhere from 45 to 55%. It's not a super high win rate. So what that means is
695.14s: I need to be very, very thoughtful about where I realize P&L because I need to keep at least a 2 to 1
702.90s: in order for me to make a meaningful amount of capital on these. One to one would be fine. But again,
709.62s: that's effectively walking out at Breakeven. That's insufficient. So I'm really looking for at least
715.78s: 2 to 1 and that's why these get managed where they do because that feeds positive data samples
725.46s: into the strategy that if I continue to manage that way long term will ultimately make money.
732.02s: This walked me out up about 22k and it was not that long of a trade about a month,
740.34s: which is about a 57% return on a VESA capital. This individual position was a really, really simple
748.66s: downside continuation that breaks a couple normal themes. One of those is you know, take a
756.26s: some set of your profit down after a move or set a really, really tight stop loss. Like those
763.62s: kinds of things can be fine, but they need to be made in tailor to the strategy. Otherwise,
769.62s: what you're doing ultimately doesn't make sense. This is a breakdown profit mechanism. I have a
776.82s: strategy outline. It's defined very purposefully. So that's I can maximize profit when these conditions
783.86s: occur. You should do the same being out there. See you later.
