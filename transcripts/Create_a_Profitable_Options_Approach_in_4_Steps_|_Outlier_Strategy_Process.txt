0.12s: what's up outliers today we are going to
2.12s: talk about the exact process I would
5.48s: follow if I were to start learning about
8.08s: options again now I already have a
10.04s: couple videos about how to start trading
12.00s: options and things like that I'll link
13.52s: to those in the notes below but I want
15.08s: to actually Zoom it up one level because
17.64s: I think if you're anything like me you
19.44s: probably just started learning about
20.88s: options and trying things where you can
23.00s: and kind of hoping that you can piece it
24.80s: together and I actually think this is a
26.72s: giant mistake that we all make so the
29.60s: goal is vide is to walk you through four
32.00s: big guiding Concepts that I think you
34.36s: should keep in mind as you go through
36.40s: this process of learning to trade
38.20s: options and the funny part is is you're
39.64s: going to notice a lot of it isn't even
41.72s: about options specifically and I'll
43.88s: explain why what's up everyone welcome
46.32s: back to the outliers let's get right
47.72s: back into this so the first of our four
50.56s: steps is Define profit mechanism and
53.32s: this is plural you can have multiple
55.00s: profit mechanisms why would I start with
56.72s: this if I'm talking about learning to
59.04s: trade options why am I even bothering
61.36s: with a profit mechanism why am I not
63.36s: diving directly into what calls are what
65.60s: puts are and things like that well it's
67.36s: because options are simply vehicles to
71.64s: express an opinion there's no magic in
74.60s: an option there's leverage which is kind
76.64s: of magical there's volatility also
78.36s: pretty sick but there's nothing that
80.56s: inherently makes them profitable and if
82.16s: you're anything like me when we first
84.04s: start trading options we start learning
86.28s: all these intricate details about charm
89.36s: Vana we want to know about the velocity
91.72s: of gamma we want to know about Theta
94.00s: Decay we want to know about expiration
96.12s: Cycles earnings releases all these kinds
98.08s: of things which are important to know
99.56s: we'll get to that in a little bit but
101.16s: none of that matters if you don't
103.20s: actually know what you're trying to
105.48s: trade to make money this is something we
107.68s: almost always all universally Overlook
111.20s: so what I offer is a way to break down
115.04s: this broader problem set into a simpler
117.52s: one and whether or not you want to trade
120.68s: directionally for Price up or down if
123.16s: you want to trade volatility direction
125.20s: if you want to trade structural
126.80s: volatility there's lots of different
129.04s: profit mechanisms that are out there and
130.76s: if you spend some time digging around
132.60s: ssrn you'll find tons of them and if
134.92s: you're in the patreon I have a entire
138.08s: Archive of hundreds of studies that
140.60s: essentially talk about all these
141.92s: different kinds of things but it doesn't
143.96s: matter if you know all of the intricate
146.40s: details about selling a strangle if you
148.88s: sell a strangle and something that's
150.52s: exhibiting a breakout you're wrong
152.52s: you're going to lose money no matter how
154.56s: well you understand those options so
157.08s: this is the very first step to learning
160.04s: how to trade options is understanding
162.52s: something that makes money so for
165.12s: example if we grab the platform and we
167.16s: take a look at TAA just kind of picking
169.24s: a random one here but it exhibits two
171.64s: things side by side I can show you a
174.40s: price Direction breakout here that was
177.04s: fueled by good earnings that then turned
180.08s: into positive drift and momentum over
183.00s: the next quarter this is representative
185.68s: of a phenomenon called ped post earnings
189.12s: announcement drift it's that is a profit
191.64s: mechanism so whether you have a system
194.08s: to trade these breakouts whether you
195.68s: have a system to trade the subsequent
197.40s: drift whatever it is whatever the profit
199.80s: mechanism is doesn't matter but you need
201.48s: a profit mechanism so what I'm not
203.40s: worried about with that is am I going to
205.20s: trade a vertical call spread or am I
207.80s: going to trade a bull put spread none of
209.64s: it matters what matters upfront is
212.64s: understanding how you make money this is
216.56s: the first step unequivocally so another
219.12s: example here of structural volatility is
221.64s: this concept of variance risk premiums
223.56s: and if you're unfamiliar with what that
225.32s: is and what IV is how all that works I
227.60s: have another video I will link to down
229.48s: below for you to check out but
230.88s: essentially we know that in general the
233.76s: market overprices implied volatility
236.92s: relative to Historic volatility and the
239.56s: way way to visualize that here is the
241.92s: yellow lines are implied volatility the
244.44s: white lines are historic volatility
246.96s: notice how in general the yellow lines
249.56s: are above the white lines that just
251.56s: tells us what we already know and it
253.28s: visualizes it for you that implied
255.36s: volatility tends to be overstated
257.68s: relative to Historic volatility that's
259.84s: another profit mechanism so again it
261.72s: doesn't matter in this scenario if you
263.96s: know all of the intricate details about
266.24s: the new name option strategy the flying
268.96s: dragon spitting lizard it doesn't matter
271.56s: this is ultimately what matters is how
274.20s: can you find things that make money and
276.52s: then how can you measure it because
279.28s: whether you're good at trading
281.36s: directionally up or down whether you're
283.28s: good at trading volatility is going to
285.40s: come down to your ability to identify
288.52s: reliably somewhat those circumstances
291.68s: and to find signals that help you see
294.72s: them before it happens because obviously
297.16s: in this scenario it's so easy to look
298.84s: back and say yeah post earnings
300.16s: announcement drift crushed it on
301.40s: earnings and then it drifted up over
302.88s: time yeah I can see that historically
305.08s: but the name of the game is if we're
306.68s: looking at the stock market here can we
309.08s: make that same inference so the whole
312.16s: idea is once we Define these different
314.64s: profit mechanisms that we want to trade
316.24s: and this is not exhaustive there's tons
317.96s: more we then need to measure them
320.40s: understand how they work and then we
321.56s: need to figure out how to find them so
324.08s: how do we identify different signals
327.16s: that correspond to them and then create
329.12s: scans that help us find them so for
331.56s: example if I go into my platform I built
334.56s: a scan here that helps me look for
337.00s: variance risk premiums and then I have a
339.24s: tool here that then helps me sort by
341.80s: stocks that exhibit the most variance
344.32s: risk premiums so if we take a look at
346.12s: bynd D and we pull open this you're
348.28s: going to see those yellow lines way
350.32s: ahead of the white lines that's variance
352.68s: risk premiums I can see them I can look
354.80s: for them so this is the next step in
357.32s: your process notice how I haven't even
359.28s: said the word options yet because again
362.04s: it doesn't matter if you know everything
363.96s: about options if you cannot find the
366.64s: conditions to trade them in which is
368.40s: what most of us do we jump into this
371.68s: next stage which is now you get to learn
375.00s: about options now is the point where you
377.52s: get to start getting into all the
379.16s: details your options 101 how they work
382.04s: how they behave what basic structures
384.84s: exist this is where we learn about
387.32s: options this is where you learn about
389.00s: the Greek this is where you pull up the
392.20s: outlier trading options trading for
394.40s: beginner series which has been going on
396.16s: every Friday for the past like 12
398.12s: Fridays and learn about options here
400.92s: once you know what kinds of things make
403.32s: money and then how they make money and
405.76s: how to find them this is where we get to
408.04s: learn about options then after we get
410.28s: through this stage of learning about
412.72s: options we build strategies and I have a
415.92s: video that goes in depth on how to build
419.16s: Trad strategies so if we look at this in
422.16s: a nutshell when we're going through
424.04s: these two stages outlining fitting
426.76s: structures that m match the profit
428.92s: mechanism and then building strategies
431.08s: this is where you start using tools like
433.12s: this like the trading plan that I offer
436.52s: again this is for the patreon folks but
438.92s: I've done videos on this I'll link to
440.48s: them in the notes below that you can
441.96s: make your own you can follow along in
443.32s: that video completely for free and do
444.80s: your own and then if you're in the
445.72s: patreon you can just grab an example
447.28s: from here but this is where we start CAU
449.60s: ifying what we're trying to do we start
451.68s: tracking creating systems so that we can
454.96s: reliably assess our ability to find
458.52s: profit mechanisms fit strategies that
460.84s: take the best advantage of them in the
462.88s: context of our portfolio and then build
465.64s: your approach that we aim to sustain
468.76s: over time so now you might be saying
470.92s: well how do I actually learn about
472.64s: options it's a great question once you
474.84s: get to this step I would recommend hop
477.60s: over to my website again you you can go
480.08s: into the resources tab here and then
482.72s: literally just go to this the outlier
484.96s: options trading beginners guide you'll
487.80s: see that it takes a second to load cuz
489.44s: it's kind of a big file but it'll load
491.32s: within the window here if you're so
492.80s: inclined I literally provide you a
495.12s: syllabus I tell you the things that I
497.16s: think make sense to learn in what order
499.68s: what we should try to learn in each of
502.08s: them and then I give you some reading
504.12s: materials that I think make sense to
506.60s: read as you go along and then again what
509.00s: I of down at the bottom if you go to
511.32s: this next page is literally a syllabus
513.84s: for each and every one of those topics
516.72s: with subtopics that I think make sense
518.96s: this is available to everybody for free
520.44s: you can go check this out and you can
522.12s: start learning in an organized fashion
525.16s: but before you even start this process
527.96s: here we have to do these two otherwise
530.92s: it doesn't matter how well you know
532.24s: options if you don't know what you're
534.00s: trying to take advantage of or how to
535.72s: find it you're still just going to trade
537.28s: options into the wind and that's not
539.24s: going going to Bodwell so this is
541.00s: exactly what I would do as always if
543.52s: there's any questions anything you want
545.04s: to see me talk about hit me up in the
546.68s: comments below drop me a line shoot me
548.48s: an email hop in the Discord it's free to
550.20s: join be an outlier and I'll see you guys
552.08s: later
