0.56s: what's up outliers quit market update
2.28s: we'll run through the indices then we'll
4.72s: take a quick look at what happened today
7.00s: and then I'm going to Pivot over to
8.52s: GameStop ahead of our GameStop live
11.40s: stream tonight at 5:00 p.m. Pacific time
13.92s: so if you want to come hang out get a
15.64s: little weird get a little deeper into
17.28s: GameStop that's what that will happen
19.16s: but in the meantime let's take a look at
21.24s: these markets so you can already see as
23.84s: I'm hovering over the Russell it had a
26.16s: massive down day so did the NASDAQ so
29.64s: did the e- minis we saw the S&P 500
33.40s: percentage of stocks above the 50-day
35.24s: moving average crater we saw bonds have
38.80s: a pretty good day and we saw vix
41.16s: actually pop above 18 for a little while
43.36s: which is kind of an important thing
45.12s: because vix is been a very reliable
48.80s: steady trade this year and it's been
51.76s: very static meaning we're not seeing
53.64s: these really drastic extremes but
55.44s: whenever I see it up at these levels I'm
57.52s: fading it and it's just because it has
61.36s: very seldomly remained above here for
63.48s: all too long although it can volatility
66.36s: does cluster but this has been a great
68.60s: trade so far this year essentially
70.04s: anything above 17 becomes interesting
71.92s: scaling and above
73.44s: 1819 that's that all right now I do want
77.20s: to take a look at the Futures really
78.60s: quick Futures are open right now so the
80.36s: e- minis are down a little bit more the
82.12s: Russell's about unchanged and the NASDAQ
84.28s: is down about half a point taking a look
86.76s: specifically at the Russell because I
89.96s: have uh some short puts on in there I've
92.16s: scaled the trade down massively funny
94.56s: enough um I seem to have a really random
98.36s: habit of doing this with Russell but the
101.28s: last couple days I actually had a much
102.80s: bigger position on that I was scaling
104.24s: out as we were kind of trending sideways
106.04s: here you can see that we're baking in a
108.96s: little bit of a top and that's okay
112.28s: because we need consolidation it's
114.60s: healthy for the index for the underlying
117.16s: but things are a little different this
119.04s: time one thing I notice is that the CCI
122.04s: has now turned negative which is just a
124.24s: momentum indicator it's an oscillator
126.56s: but I have pretty good success with it I
128.72s: like this one I I tinker with a lot of
130.40s: them but really what I want to draw your
132.92s: eye to down here is the net highs lows
135.16s: so we see net highs lows has now turned
137.48s: negative for sure actually a little
139.76s: deeper than the last negative we saw
141.52s: over here but take a look at the
143.20s: difference in the quality right so as I
145.16s: hover here net highs lows was 51 today
147.96s: it's -69 giggity it's not that different
151.08s: but take a look at the difference in
152.40s: these days right here's where the other
154.88s: red day was here's what it is now and
156.56s: again this is for the NASDAQ it's not
158.04s: fully representative of what you're
159.24s: going to see in the Russell but this
161.16s: gives you a pretty good idea of what's
162.56s: going on and we see highs collapsing and
166.12s: we see lows expanding so I don't
169.44s: actually love this configuration if we
171.84s: take a look at these other periods where
174.20s: we start to see these transitions these
176.44s: transition days can be kind of heavy one
179.20s: way or the other to the upside or the
180.56s: downside so it's something I'm keeping
182.68s: an eye on but the way I think about it
186.28s: now is Broad in disas I am being careful
190.32s: with risk I'm not overly allocated or
192.48s: utilized right now most of the cash I
195.04s: have is kind of being transferred over
197.88s: into more of a holding pattern for at
200.60s: least till it needs not to be I will
203.04s: maintain some exposure as per usual just
205.36s: because you never know when things are
206.52s: going to grab some lights and start
207.72s: moving but right now things are slowing
209.60s: down so what is the cause of this what
212.04s: happened well first I want to be very
214.00s: clear that people really like to
216.72s: oversimplify things in markets and we
218.52s: like to have these really neat tidy
220.44s: little descriptors of what happened
222.64s: right why did X happen and a bunch of
225.04s: things happen today now nobody ever
227.64s: fully knows why everything goes the way
230.04s: it goes in the market typically unless
231.68s: there's a massive Catalyst I just like
233.40s: to call that out because getting into
235.24s: the news cycle of listening to CNBC or
238.80s: these other news sources say oh the S&P
240.76s: 500 is down because of this it's
243.24s: probably partially because of that but
244.92s: then you also notice that the next day
246.40s: it'll be up because of a similar things
248.36s: so you just have to be careful otherwise
250.28s: if you get into this habit of these
251.80s: really neat succinct explanations for
253.96s: everything you start to oversimplify it
256.28s: just as a heuristic and you miss a lot
258.08s: of details now if I were to pinpoint
261.08s: though the primary drivers for the
262.72s: movement today it's this right here I
265.04s: think J jobless claims came in very hot
269.36s: and this is really important because
271.24s: it's seen as a form of broad stock
274.96s: market weakness and this is important
278.00s: because we've been in this really high
279.52s: inflation period for so long and we've
282.12s: been at a point now where rates have
283.80s: been held up for quite some time that
286.08s: puts a lot of pressure on small
287.92s: companies specifically small caps
289.56s: typically everybody but specifically
291.92s: small caps and as this continues you get
296.12s: to a point where you're wondering when
298.08s: things are going to break when can they
300.48s: no longer sustain viable operation when
303.44s: do they have to start laying people off
306.00s: in order for this to continue to be
307.40s: economically viable for them and this
309.92s: all feeds into the Fed rate decision
312.24s: because the FED in the previous meeting
314.72s: said that they're not cutting rates and
317.28s: for the last meeting and the market
318.84s: didn't care that's what we expected to
320.48s: see but if we take a look at what the
322.84s: Market's expectations are for September
325.04s: it is that a cut is coming so now the
327.24s: question becomes how big of a cut and
329.08s: notice the change yesterday it was an
332.52s: 88% probability of a quarter point cut
336.88s: today after that came out that dropped
339.72s: literally 10 points and we now have a
342.40s: 22% probability of a 50 basis point cut
346.52s: why is that because the market is
349.04s: starting to see weakness and if this
351.28s: persists for too long it's important to
353.36s: remember that there's leads and lags to
355.64s: all of this so if this continues at this
358.40s: rate it puts the market in a compromised
360.60s: position moving forward so that's why in
363.52s: my opinion a primary driver of this was
367.16s: the unemployment metric coming out and
369.28s: being much higher than pretty much
371.04s: everybody expected it to be so this will
374.52s: likely be an important data point for
376.52s: Big Daddy j po and his decision on what
378.44s: he wants to do with rates all right so
380.40s: now let's talk about GameStop quickly
383.12s: and it's because this trend is assuming
386.76s: so again this is I talked about this
388.84s: yesterday this is not surprising to me I
391.48s: don't want it to do this but this is
393.36s: what it's doing regardless of what I
394.92s: want Shocker the market is not listening
397.36s: to my wishes it's unbelievable really
399.88s: and to me we're getting close to this
402.04s: first stop as I see it at least which is
404.64s: this 2098 2ish handle again I always
408.96s: think it's important to remind people
410.72s: GameStop is one of those really unique
412.28s: Beasts where it when it decides not to
415.16s: follow standard pricing Behavior it
417.36s: doesn't right what when you see things
419.72s: go through these kinds of Cycles this is
421.36s: not standard pricing Behavior so even
423.60s: though that this is in a very standard
426.04s: descending trend line if I put a linear
428.32s: regression best fit line on it it's
429.96s: going to be descending from this point
432.48s: the thing is is as soon as there's some
434.16s: sort of catalyst that turns it around
436.16s: it'll shoot right up it like this so
440.24s: it's an important point because I always
441.96s: have to remind myself as I'm looking at
443.56s: this product you can always apply
445.04s: technical analysis to things it's simply
448.12s: observing Behavior
450.08s: of Market participants and their
452.32s: conviction with how they choose to buy
453.84s: and sell now with that you can read into
456.36s: it a lot and you can determine
457.60s: standardized patterns behaviors and
459.44s: extrapolate that across a broader data
461.64s: set you can't really do that as well
463.76s: with GameStop I run studies on all the
466.76s: different kinds of studies I like to use
468.40s: you'll notice that I switch between them
470.00s: sometimes based on what I'm kind of
471.64s: flagging is working really well at a
473.28s: given point in time in a current market
475.64s: condition and GameStop fails them all
477.56s: the time when you kind of want them most
480.16s: so what I mean by that is during this
482.60s: less volatile period going back in here
485.56s: you can come up with some pretty good
487.16s: ideas of standard technical analysis but
489.80s: even these kinds of really big moves you
492.72s: don't it's really difficult to you know
495.40s: pinpoint the pivot so that's okay that's
498.68s: kind of what makes it special and that's
501.20s: why I like using options also to just
503.20s: use it as an amplifying function of
505.64s: determining price Behavior so what are
507.72s: we seeing here downtrends continuing I
509.92s: still think 21 is very likely on the
512.88s: horizon hopefully not but what makes me
516.04s: say that is I'm seeing the buy volume
517.96s: continue here right so you can see
519.96s: essentially coming back to 26 July we've
523.04s: had buy volume I'm sorry sell volume on
526.80s: a daily basis coming in above 90% every
530.44s: single day so there's just people
532.20s: selling and there's a lot of people
533.80s: selling here why who knows and you can
537.16s: see that the point of control is now up
538.88s: here I imagine for a lot of people
540.84s: there's fear about getting stuck in the
543.60s: stock at 20 when it's spent a long time
546.96s: below 10 now that still doesn't seem
550.08s: like the floor to me we've had a couple
552.68s: conversations about this it looks like
554.64s: after this 21 handle where I'm pricing
556.92s: it off of this node it looks like the ne
559.40s: next node is here at like 15 you can see
562.20s: it right in there so I'm just
564.12s: referencing where people previously
566.32s: transacted with the underline but you
567.88s: can see another node building right here
570.32s: in the 17 handle
572.52s: 1771 so there's a good chance that
575.12s: buyers will continue to step in down
576.88s: here as well but we are getting into a
578.88s: lighter volume area and all that means
581.08s: is price becomes more loose in those
583.44s: zones it means that there's not enough
585.68s: not as much support or resistance that's
589.24s: why price bounces around in these kinds
590.96s: of things very quickly right as you see
593.36s: price like this making these kind of
594.88s: moves look how light that volume is but
597.08s: it's just flying through this and it's
599.40s: because there's not much support or
601.36s: resistance to slow it down and you'll
603.72s: see that when there is a lot more
605.76s: support and resistance that's built out
607.52s: over time due to heavy volume price
609.80s: becomes sticky around those points until
612.16s: it starts traversing above or below and
614.56s: in this case we're drip it traversing
616.48s: below this most recent point of control
620.16s: so let's take a look now at the options
623.52s: I'm seeing 71,000 calls against 388,000
627.12s: puts so again this is not the most
631.08s: bullish configuration I've seen for this
633.40s: product specifically I'm seeing
635.16s: continued build out in 16 August I've
637.28s: said that multiple times now but on the
639.44s: call side that's where most of the
640.84s: volume is starting to dump in now what I
642.72s: do want to show you this is total oi
645.28s: across all the options chains take take
647.08s: a look at these this is in 17
649.88s: j25 so we have some pretty long
652.28s: expirations starting to pop up 17 genn
654.56s: 25 again the 125 there's already 20,000
657.04s: of those if we look across the current
659.36s: strikes for calls where the most oi is
662.08s: this is essentially tied for third so
665.32s: there's a massive amount of options
669.04s: being built out in these longer term
671.56s: expirations and they're creeping up
673.16s: which is really interesting even this
675.84s: expiration cycle which is the 18 October
678.04s: 24 right that's 78 days out so that's
681.12s: interesting to see and this is something
682.64s: I've been talking about where it feels
684.40s: like we continue to have so much
686.72s: centralization in these near-term
688.28s: expirations but it's actually starting
690.64s: to slide out a little bit into the next
692.72s: primary exploration and then even
694.36s: further out than that so what does that
696.08s: tell me from an options
698.44s: perspective it just looks like the
700.76s: market is being priced in for a more
703.88s: mellow two weeks and I've said that
706.76s: before I can I'm just reiterating that
708.72s: sentiment as far as I can see now
710.68s: sometimes people will say that I say a
712.36s: lot of stuff in the video but not
714.36s: there's nothing that they can pull out
715.64s: so I'm trying to make it more clear I
717.08s: try to avoid that typically because I
718.92s: want people people to come to their own
720.28s: conclusions but for those that are
722.28s: unfamiliar with like how to take the
724.48s: information I'm saying and decipher it
726.60s: into or I guess interpret it not really
728.28s: decipher it's pretty clear in my opinion
730.32s: but to turn it into usable information
732.56s: I'm trying to specifically call those
733.80s: out for you guys so here in 16 Aug this
738.60s: is where things are the the busiest next
741.72s: and it's not crazy for the at the monies
745.32s: so the 21 and a halfs are very light the
747.80s: 22s are a little bit busier but you can
749.52s: see out here at the 25s that's a very
751.68s: dense very dense strike 177,000 oi at
755.44s: 25s with 3600 transacted today and 1100
759.04s: net new over yesterday so I bring that
761.72s: to your attention because it tells me
763.12s: people are building in this expiration
765.60s: cycle they're not taking positions down
768.32s: whereas if I look in here notice and
770.60s: this is exactly what I expected based on
772.48s: the video yesterday if you'll recall
774.00s: that I thought the 25s people would be
776.04s: taking down and rolling out and that's
777.60s: exactly what they're doing so you can
779.36s: see that there was 4,000 on the oi net
783.40s: that means people close these positions
785.04s: my guess is again that they're just
786.12s: moving them out in time because they're
787.40s: not seeing the price behavior and
788.96s: they're trying to salvage what they can
791.24s: of the remaining time value so what's
794.36s: the play here for me I still have my
796.32s: long shares and I intend to hold those I
798.72s: have a decent basis on them but even if
800.84s: I didn't like I told you guys I plan to
802.88s: hold them just to support the ape
805.00s: movement I like I like it I like what
807.12s: you guys are about it's fun for me to
808.64s: participate
809.72s: so that's the deal with the shares and I
811.36s: I highlight that because I'm essentially
813.76s: turning the Trader part of my brain off
816.60s: and I'm using some money to participate
819.28s: now the Trader part of my brain has
821.84s: short calls on still in 20 September
824.44s: against the long shares that I've
826.72s: already made some money on I've rolled
828.48s: them down and I probably will scrub a
830.80s: little bit more off of them because
833.16s: they're producing and it's just allowing
835.00s: me to not just see the unrealized gains
838.64s: on my shares dwindle but it's allowing
841.32s: me to take some money in while that's
842.96s: happening in terms of long options I I
845.52s: have none of them right now in GameStop
847.72s: and I don't intend to until I start to
850.52s: see it behaving closer to what I want so
853.32s: really what I'm paying attention to is
855.28s: when do I see more buying volume right
859.36s: because right now it's not here and uh
862.08s: somebody else made a comment about how
864.00s: you know they said that the buyers have
865.20s: never stepped away which I appreciate I
867.04s: know that the Apes have have always been
869.20s: there but what I mean is from a broader
870.96s: Market perspective you need you need big
873.40s: volume and with the amount of the at the
876.48s: money offering that came through there's
878.00s: a lot of shares floating around right
879.84s: now so the float isn't as locked up as
882.52s: it used to be so what that means is this
885.20s: that's partially good and bad it's good
888.52s: in this case because even though we're
890.00s: seeing these sellers coming through in
892.20s: Mass they're not really crushing the
894.36s: price it's going down but they're not
896.36s: crushing it uh which again is is
899.40s: probably because a lot of shares got
900.96s: also picked up during the at the money
903.12s: offering so we'll have to see where it
905.52s: starts to stabilize that's what I'm most
907.52s: interested in when does this start
910.76s: consolidating that's where I start
912.44s: looking adding long options that's where
914.24s: I start looking to add more shares for
916.40s: me the trading side of my brain when I
918.64s: see something going down I'm not going
920.72s: to build a long position until its tenor
924.16s: changes the downside of that I very
926.64s: rarely top tick or bottom tick something
929.04s: so even this move here when I first
931.20s: started getting in in the beginning of
932.48s: the may I I waited until this breakout
935.52s: came through so I didn't get in here I
937.16s: didn't get in here and these periods
939.72s: obviously would have made me some more
940.96s: money but the problem is is again from a
943.32s: trading perspective I'm thinking about
945.80s: probabilistic outcomes what's most
947.88s: probable to happen and then how can I
949.48s: put money behind those ideas so that's
951.72s: why I think about it the way I do so as
953.96s: always any questions let me know throw
955.48s: them in the comments be an outlier I'll
957.24s: see you guys later
