0.68s: what's up allers time for a quick market
2.28s: update we have a few things on the
3.68s: agenda we're going to talk about Quantum
5.40s: Computing quick Market overview PPI
7.44s: which came in a little bit hot we have a
10.08s: split coming up in a pretty well-known
11.80s: stock pnw and then I want to take a look
13.88s: at Tesla in tww maybe tww if we have
17.52s: time so I want to start with this though
19.76s: because Quantum Computing is starting to
21.16s: gain a lot of traction and it reminds me
22.64s: a lot of just what we've seen in AI
25.04s: where AI was kind of quiet didn't hear
27.40s: too much about it then you started to
28.76s: hear a little bit about it and then
30.60s: pretty damn quickly actually yesterday
32.44s: for me I updated my phone and in iOS
35.12s: 18.2 or whatever it is it's now
38.28s: integrated into the software itself that
41.40s: I can use chat PT so adoption for
43.84s: something like AI is moving super super
46.16s: fast now Quantum Computing has a very
49.76s: different use case and I don't
52.52s: necessarily see the same spread as
55.24s: something like AI that can be in many
57.16s: different shapes and forms and really
58.32s: impact just about everybody it's
59.48s: literally on phone you're not going to
61.44s: have that on Quantum Computing on a
63.40s: phone at least in the near term who
64.76s: knows what it might be in some years
66.72s: from now now the interesting thing
69.20s: though is that now is typically the time
71.56s: to find things that we think might be a
75.16s: big part of this Quantum Computing
77.16s: movement if we think that it's powerful
81.00s: now for those that are curious what
82.84s: Quantum Computing is I'm literally the
85.16s: last person on planet Earth to explain
86.76s: it to you because I'm an idiot now I can
89.60s: summ Miz it at a very high level which
92.12s: it's essentially the ability to solve
94.92s: more challenging problems that an
97.16s: existing computer cannot and it's a
99.16s: restriction based on the way standard
101.16s: computers now use bits they exist in
103.20s: either a one or a zero state that adds a
105.96s: natural constraint to what they can
108.28s: compute quantum computers use something
110.48s: called Q bits that can exist in multiple
113.08s: States they can be one or zero or and
115.80s: zero which is really cool and it allows
118.24s: them to solve really big problems
120.32s: simulations and things like that that
122.44s: your computer as it sits today cannot do
125.32s: which is again very neat but let's
127.52s: listen to this from Fast Money this is a
129.08s: couple days old but this talks a little
131.52s: bit about some of the error correction
134.40s: component to it I I haven't listened to
136.12s: this yet I'm actually going to listen to
137.16s: you right now with you guys this just
138.28s: looked interesting to
139.84s: me uh I'm in the camp I think uh
142.44s: consistent with what most of the
143.92s: panelist said which is this is probably
145.68s: too much for today I agree with guy that
149.04s: this is more of a validation point for
151.44s: Google's Tech but this just to put in
153.52s: perspective they started this Willow
155.60s: project 12 years ago and so uh the
158.72s: potential around this being
160.32s: commercialized uh is probably 10 years
163.08s: away and so it's a it's still a long
165.08s: time it that's interesting to I
169.52s: understand the point that he's making
171.28s: which is very interesting
174.20s: overall but I also am continually
177.80s: impressed at how fast things can move
180.60s: once there's the right incentive
182.00s: structure in place again I'm sure for
184.52s: something like widespread adoption
186.08s: utilization it probably is some time off
189.32s: to me 10 years just sounds like a long
191.84s: time for something like that especially
193.80s: if there's enough opportunity for
197.76s: example if a company like Google really
200.48s: sees a huge opportunity as the
202.88s: technology starts to take
204.92s: shape I wouldn't be surprised if that
207.24s: timeline is pretty severely accelerated
209.16s: and this goes back back to the point I
211.20s: was making just before that if these are
213.52s: the kind of things that you want to try
216.24s: to trade and for me it absolutely is
218.24s: because these kinds of Technologies lead
221.04s: to these massive waves of movement that
224.40s: can quite literally give you a year twoe
228.24s: three years worth of gains if you're in
230.40s: the correct stuff with the correct style
232.44s: trades to capitalize on the Move It ASM
235.00s: fold so that doesn't mean it's happening
237.04s: right now today but it does mean that
240.16s: keeping a really close eye on the
242.12s: movement of this technology and when it
243.92s: starts to catch fire finding companies
246.36s: that we think are really going to be
248.24s: leaders or contributors and another note
251.44s: on that is big companies like Google
253.48s: will be a big part of this also stuff
255.44s: like IBM will be a big part of this so
257.24s: on and so forth however the stuff that's
261.16s: going to move a lot is going to be small
262.56s: cap mid stop midcap stocks that
265.28s: contribute to this in some way so now is
267.96s: the time to build that watch list it's
269.44s: the time time to start going through
271.28s: what we think feeds into Quantum
273.48s: Computing in some way and it might be a
275.96s: little bit early because here's the
277.32s: other thing even before there's
279.76s: widespread adoption all of these smaller
282.44s: companies are going to have to get their
283.72s: supply chains in line they're going to
285.08s: have to broker all these different deals
286.56s: in order to feed the commercialization
288.64s: so a lot of that move is going to happen
291.08s: in those kinds of companies before the
293.52s: full scale adoption just something to be
295.16s: aware of let's keep going it does speak
297.60s: there is a piece where the stock should
299.20s: have been up today I would have guess a
300.64s: few percent because I think it does
302.48s: speak to Google invested in the right
305.56s: areas for what will be continuing Tech
308.64s: acceleration in the decades to come I
310.84s: mean this is a Google investor is a
312.44s: sleep well at night similar as wayo is a
315.24s: sleep well at night business doesn't get
316.92s: a ton of attention but I think
318.24s: collectively Melissa I would have
320.20s: expected the stock to be up a couple
321.76s: percent today not 5 per. Gan I love when
324.24s: you agree with me so thank you I'll ask
325.72s: you this question then on the back of
327.08s: that who should be worried about this I
329.12s: saw on your it's probably not Nvidia not
331.32s: AMD yet but somebody has to
334.40s: be yeah I think you know there's some of
336.56s: the other uh Quantum uh companies
339.32s: there's private companies on that side
341.04s: but I think on the public side um you
343.80s: know the the worries are are probably
346.72s: because this is again is so far away I
348.68s: think the the piece that uh the rest of
350.88s: the mag 7 needs to be contemplating here
353.24s: and invid needs to be thinking about is
355.04s: just what are they doing to have some
357.04s: sort of position within Quantum
358.96s: Computing it is is it's Theory right now
361.52s: but I think you have to you have to
363.52s: imagine they already have thought
364.48s: through this and then some so I
366.52s: understand his Point again but I don't
368.76s: think that this is nvidia's time to like
371.68s: start thinking about it I'm pretty sure
373.44s: Nvidia understands has ideas on how they
376.00s: want to get involved what they think
377.24s: they can do and then it's a matter of
379.60s: what's the right timing to execute
381.04s: against it and whatnot but the the
383.64s: reality is quantum Computing is very
386.60s: likely the the next big thing now
390.16s: I say that in a different context than
392.48s: something like AI for the reasons I
393.96s: described earlier AI has the ability to
396.60s: show up in many different forms and
398.00s: impact quite literally everything even
400.96s: super small use cases to people playing
402.92s: around with the voice version of chat
405.60s: GPT because it's funny to using it to
408.88s: accelerate the building of newsletters
412.44s: and collating news all different kinds
414.92s: of things as a Trader you can use AI to
417.12s: review what you're doing and give you
418.44s: feedback it's it's liter really about as
420.64s: multivariate as you can get you can load
422.68s: different files and query against it
424.44s: I've done that with a bunch of different
425.68s: studies from ssrn it essentially becomes
427.76s: a Super Genius that can answers all
429.52s: different kinds of questions provide
430.84s: research from a giant library of studies
432.72s: I have so it's like AI can impact lots
436.44s: of things Quantum Computing is going to
438.04s: have very specific use cases in the
439.80s: beginning as it's going to scale it's
441.72s: going to move a little bit slower now
443.92s: you can see that there's a couple
445.36s: companies that they highlight that are
449.16s: um likely involved in this to a varying
451.32s: degree so let's take a look at these I'm
452.72s: going to move away from tww for now the
455.56s: main reason why this was on the list is
456.92s: because they're just crushing it take
458.16s: take a look at this run they've post
460.36s: earnings they came in at a do two they
463.60s: were expected at 8 cents so smashed
467.92s: earnings and has just been floating up
470.68s: floating up to the sky this is why post
473.56s: earnings announcement drift is such a
476.32s: important factor especially for small
478.12s: cap midcap stocks lots of money to be
480.56s: made on stuff like this now that aside
483.08s: let's take a look at some of these other
484.16s: names from that article so RG TI is one
486.60s: of
488.04s: them and this obviously is moving a lot
491.48s: to do with the news from
494.52s: Google IO NQ this one's interesting
497.44s: because this has popped up on a lot of
499.40s: my scanners and this is something I've
501.80s: been keeping an eyeball on for a little
503.40s: while now this also had a pretty rough
507.72s: earnings but the for past was generally
511.48s: solid and we are seeing seeing it tailor
514.92s: off a little bit here so we'll just
516.00s: create an alert keep an eyeball on this
517.68s: bad boy see how it goes and then um I
521.72s: thought there was one more there it is
524.96s: qbts that's a good
528.28s: name so this looks just about the same
530.80s: as R
531.88s: GTI like they're essentially the same
534.36s: charts qbts
540.52s: these are a handful of names that you
543.28s: might want to keep an eye on and you can
544.84s: tell that these are very early stage
546.96s: names because most of them are still
548.64s: running in the red right so this had
550.80s: negative earnings here what did it
552.64s: produce here it was also negative
554.60s: earnings here this is very common for
556.08s: companies that are getting their feet
557.52s: under them and starting to grow so
560.32s: definitely something to keep an eyeball
561.64s: on now from a broad Market perspective
564.92s: today we saw Tech and large capap hold
568.24s: on so the S&P 500 and q's about the same
571.52s: small caps still rolling over really
573.72s: interesting so we just reviewed the FED
575.52s: watch tool yesterday it's overwhelming
577.24s: probability of a 25 base point cut and
579.84s: yet the market rolls over so that I find
583.04s: slightly interesting discretionary is
585.16s: still absolutely crushing it we can see
587.92s: things like healthcare not doing quite
589.76s: as well utility is not doing quite as
591.44s: well real estate is slowly basing a
593.52s: little bit but I would not be surprised
595.60s: at all to see continued downside here
597.92s: and energy just run running down
600.08s: Industrials running down so we're seeing
601.88s: a rotation which is really important if
605.40s: you're too late to this party then
607.92s: that's when you're overp positioned to
609.60s: the upside even though there's a pretty
611.64s: big rotation going on within the indices
614.64s: themselves and within the sectors
615.84s: themselves this doesn't mean crashed it
617.08s: doesn't mean that the Market's going
618.08s: down but it does mean pay attention to
620.40s: this stuff because it absolutely can go
623.68s: from slow to fast really quick and you
627.04s: don't want to be CAU on the wrong side
628.44s: just because we're not looking at stuff
629.88s: it's typically a pretty bad reason to go
631.92s: down next up we have
635.40s: PPI and PPI came in a bit hot 0.4 month
640.64s: over month compared to 0.2 and before
644.12s: 0.3 and core PPI was 0.2 right in line
647.92s: with consensus so inflation's looking a
651.20s: little weird here it's looking like
652.96s: there's some artifacts of it actually
655.64s: expanding a little bit not excessively I
658.48s: don't think the Market's freaking out
659.80s: about it but it's also not necessarily
663.76s: tamped all the way down and we saw this
665.76s: also with CPI from yesterday so this is
669.44s: something that we really need to pay
671.88s: attention to because this inflation
674.60s: being in a holding pattern is a really
676.56s: really big gimme in terms of the way
678.56s: that the market is performing if that
680.16s: starts changing in any significant
682.12s: degree that
684.16s: absolutely has the potential to start
687.00s: adding a lot of volatility to the market
688.88s: even Market's very very complacent right
691.40s: now next let's take a look at PW and
695.88s: this is primarily because it does have a
697.60s: split coming up the stock has had a
699.92s: really really solid run and a lot of
702.40s: times post split for stuff like this we
704.56s: will see new money being able to find
707.12s: its way into the stock that people like
708.64s: and I'm also I don't know if good old
711.24s: Pelosi let's find out this has been in
714.00s: pel's portfolio for a while I don't know
715.92s: if it still is that'll probably
717.12s: completely dictate what all of us should
719.04s: do
720.80s: and let's take a peek I'm not affiliated
722.44s: with these guys they have a really great
723.68s: tool for this and let's see Tesla P
729.08s: there it is options too you got to love
732.28s: that Pelos is out here slanging options
734.08s: take a look at this her strategies are
737.44s: just smashing she's up over
740.16s: 800% compared to a measly 200% over the
743.96s: same reference time frame for the S&P
745.56s: 500 it's it's almost like it's almost
748.40s: like
749.88s: almost like she might have information
753.04s: that other people might not really
756.40s: great really great positioning here
758.84s: though and it looks like the last couple
761.12s: trades were in 21
763.56s: Feb but this is something I've seen pop
766.12s: up on our portfolio uh a few times so
769.60s: you know what that means full port
771.72s: because Po in Pelosi we trust at least
774.08s: in terms of our returns Tesla absolute
778.56s: tear so somebody asked me if I could
779.88s: take a look at this and Tesla has been
783.48s: on a on a burner of a move now there's a
788.00s: lot of drivers I can see leading into
790.40s: this but regardless of what all of them
793.48s: are what I think here is sooner or later
797.68s: there is extension and I really prefer
800.08s: to follow momentum but the way I sought
803.44s: is getting in post this it just becomes
805.80s: a really high-risk entry for a shorter
808.76s: term swing slum style trade not for a
811.44s: long-term investment long-term
812.68s: investment is whatever it is now one
814.88s: thing I try to remind people though that
817.32s: if you go further out in time this is
819.84s: going out to 5 years notice how we're
823.20s: now just getting back to the Peaks that
827.12s: we saw at the end of 21 that's an
830.12s: important note this isn't a lot of like
832.60s: brand new unchartered territory we are
835.08s: now just getting to this so all of this
838.12s: preceding move while very impressive is
841.00s: still a recovery move we don't start
843.32s: getting into new territory literally
845.20s: until today so I think that context is
850.00s: really really important when we look at
851.44s: this because this kind of move seems rip
853.92s: your face off impressive and it is but
857.32s: that being said it's still overwhelming
859.96s: majority recovery so far and now we're
862.96s: just getting into new territory so
865.12s: that's something else I keep an eyeball
866.44s: on so lots of stuff going on as always
869.52s: if there's anything you want me to take
870.56s: a look at let me know be an outlier I'll
872.72s: see you all later
