0.92s: what's up outliers we're on the mobile
2.36s: setup today and I open up the platform
5.60s: and GameStop rallies 6.
8.60s: 34% so a really really big day and I
11.56s: want to talk about it for a few
13.04s: different reasons the first thing I want
15.28s: to talk about is shout out to benzinga
18.00s: here who's talking about some homies
20.40s: taking a a bearish sentiment towards
23.76s: GameStop we'll talk about that I see
26.56s: what they're talking about really a
28.36s: series of larger transactions here
30.72s: but I think that they're missing a lot
33.36s: of other pieces that are worth talking
35.56s: about so the overall story narrative
39.16s: here is a little bit interesting so take
42.04s: a look at the candle it had very little
44.92s: down tick and then it almost cracked
47.96s: above I mean we were so close to
50.16s: cracking above 30 if I zoom this out to
52.52s: a one-year daily you can see that we are
54.48s: just below that 30 handle which as we
56.52s: talked about before it's kind of like
58.28s: the next area of resistance at least as
60.76s: far as I see it these these kinds of
63.00s: candles are interesting and again I'm
64.88s: not super big into Candlestick analysis
66.76s: Beyond trying to use it to infer what
68.56s: the market is doing on the back end and
71.28s: what this means is take a look at the
72.64s: volume bar for today it was essentially
75.76s: all bu volume so I'm looking at 12.9
80.36s: million shares traded and 6% of that was
84.32s: sale volume with
86.16s: 94% as buy volume so this is actually
90.72s: way way way busier than I would have
93.76s: expected leading into earnings like this
95.80s: kind of move I genuinely was expecting
98.00s: it definitely to be in the 30 like this
100.20s: range that I defined I think we talked
102.00s: about this on the recent live stream but
103.92s: I didn't expect it to be this sick of a
106.76s: move I thought that it would be kind of
109.48s: more days like this more days like this
111.24s: more days like this where we're kind of
113.04s: like inside days that are continuing to
115.16s: grind and follow this trend but that's
118.32s: not what was in mind here so the high we
120.80s: hit again I mean we we're just a few
122.96s: pennies off which is pretty impressive
125.12s: the fact that this was also done on
126.48s: really big volume is important now if we
128.92s: take a look I think you can see it yeah
130.32s: you can see it down here on the
131.28s: oscillators the oscillators aren't even
133.04s: tired yet so this is using a uh RSI that
137.24s: has a 7-Day vwap moving average and
140.56s: they're hovering I mean just at really
143.48s: healthy levels it is depending on
145.80s: whether you use 80/20 setup or 7030 I
148.80s: kind of prefer uh 8020 just because it
152.04s: really emphasizes extremes a bit more
154.68s: but some that are a little more
156.12s: conservative will use stuff like 7030
159.20s: but you'll spend a lot of time above 70
161.72s: so and that's I mean really case in
163.84s: point here now the moving averages are
166.24s: expanding in terms of width which means
169.32s: that we're seeing overall volume on the
172.12s: buy side expand now what I am eager to
175.52s: see is this moving average here which is
179.12s: a longer term moving average this one is
180.96s: a 120-day moving average and it's not
185.48s: yet upward sloping it's kind of taking
188.72s: its time which is a little interesting
190.84s: to me because we have the 10 the 20 the
193.56s: 50 here and then this one is like a 6
195.68s: month a 120 you use 120 150 whatever fls
198.84s: your belt actually let's flip this real
200.16s: quick to a 150 I just want to see what
201.68s: it looks like this is 150 is a little
203.64s: more widely used than 120 so I'm
207.60s: wondering what that's looking like let's
209.00s: see
210.72s: okay so yeah this kind of captures a
212.84s: little bit more of this move better
214.76s: because it's Gathering a little bit more
216.36s: of the longer term breadth so really all
218.64s: we need is this last moving average to
220.44s: pop above that 150 and we have a little
223.92s: bit of uh like strong alignment and
227.08s: continuation in the moving averages
229.12s: which is cool to see we still are coming
231.44s: into earnings which is on the fourth of
233.92s: December right now after the close we'll
236.60s: see if it remains there and I mean the
241.04s: the move here is nothing to scoff at and
244.56s: I think what I'm looking for now is how
248.12s: does it behave around the 30 handle and
251.20s: the reason why I care about that is
252.44s: because when I look for support and
254.36s: resistance between kind of 35 and 30
258.24s: it's super light so this area that it's
261.04s: building in now is hands down the
263.32s: breadth of trading volume for the last
265.40s: 6-month period and then even if we move
267.20s: out to the last year you can see so the
270.08s: the cool thing is we're seeing the bulk
272.76s: of trading volume sliding up and up and
276.20s: up so that means that again the the
279.44s: value of the stock is being considered
282.08s: by more people now the overall strength
285.72s: of the trend I think is at risk here if
288.24s: we get another couple big continuation
290.16s: days obviously then it looks like a
292.00s: continuation but this also looks like it
294.48s: can roll over and Trend sideways into
297.76s: earnings right so we can see this upward
299.40s: trend
300.24s: it hits kind of that 30ish handle very
303.08s: close on the 20th and then it's been
305.04s: rolling sideways a bit big upday closing
308.32s: near the highs which is good so
311.08s: possibility for a continuation is not
313.68s: small I think that it's pretty fair as I
316.84s: see it here but it also tends again we
319.84s: tend to see slightly more mellow
321.88s: movement coming into earnings although
323.92s: we already talked about we looked at the
325.64s: probabilities what was it on the live
327.52s: stream two days ago and the
329.04s: probabilities are really really strong
330.96s: for a healthy move so and it was up to
334.16s: like 35 I think if I'm not mistaken so
336.48s: let's take a look now at the options
338.28s: chain and see what happened today so we
339.76s: had
340.44s: 210,000 calls trade against 29,000 puts
344.20s: and the overwhelming majority of those
346.16s: calls are on the buy side so this is
348.20s: people building to the long side and
351.04s: that's why that benzinga thing I had it
352.60s: up in the beginning so I thought it was
353.80s: kind of cute they they were talking
355.76s: about a couple you know different
358.56s: positions that people people were were
360.40s: building but I could just tell from the
363.64s: underlying activity today and then the
365.60s: overall options volume that I took a
367.28s: peek at that there's way more bullish
369.80s: positioning going on here like light
371.28s: years more bullish positioning and if
373.12s: you take a look at the majority of the
374.28s: puts they're on the cell side so there
376.24s: are definitely people buying puts why
377.92s: wouldn't there be it's starting to get
379.24s: near Highs but it's a really small
381.04s: subset of the overall volume that we see
383.92s: now let's take a look at where the
385.04s: volume was this is
387.72s: interesting this is really interesting
389.72s: thing because we broke out of all of the
393.88s: volume being in the front expirations
396.64s: and now it looks like we're back in the
398.72s: front expirations the majority of the
400.84s: volume here is in 29 no and
403.88s: 6ds and those are two non-standard
407.28s: expirations although 6D does capture
410.16s: earnings so I would expect to see 6D to
413.72s: be a little more active just simply from
417.12s: the fact that it has earnings so this is
419.16s: interesting to me now let's take a look
421.44s: at two more things I want to look at the
422.76s: open interest we're still bulk out in 17
425.92s: Gen and 25 so those longer positions
427.60s: that we've talked about plenty of times
429.04s: now the other thing I want to take a
430.96s: look at is changes in oi for these
435.76s: individual expiration Cycles so take a
438.08s: look at this this is all buildout right
440.52s: all of this green I'm tracking it's a
443.12s: custom thing script that I've built and
445.92s: I'm tracking the change in open interest
447.96s: from yesterday into today and then
451.64s: today this is going to go up again
454.00s: because there's
455.36s: 31,000 calls at the 30 handle expiring
459.40s: 29 no and there was only 25,000 open
463.12s: interest so that tells us at least 6,000
465.68s: of these are going to be added on to
467.48s: this which is again people really really
470.40s: bullishly positioning it looks like
472.68s: people are expecting this move to to
474.24s: heat up a little bit I'm interested in
477.68s: that theory maybe you guys know a little
479.04s: bit more about it than I do I would love
480.92s: to learn about it because with earnings
483.84s: coming up normally companies will be a
485.76s: little more mellow into earnings so if
487.96s: this were me I wouldn't be yoloing into
490.76s: the 29 nove expiration unless again I'm
493.84s: like supremely convicted that there's
495.92s: something expected here so I don't know
497.72s: if there's something from like the Emoji
498.96s: timeline that you guys know about or if
500.96s: there's some other Confluence that
503.48s: people are expecting to hit sometime
505.44s: this week again I'm I'm traveling so I
507.80s: haven't been as uh close to the news so
511.56s: you guys will have to keep me up to
512.92s: speed so let's take a look at 6 D this
515.92s: is mostly build out much smaller though
517.88s: right take a look at the oi change here
520.08s: at the 30s it's 342 take a look at the
523.12s: change at the 30s here it's 2,522 with
527.04s: another 31,000 traded today so these are
529.48s: people playing the front expiration hard
531.20s: really really hard same thing out here
533.76s: we're not seeing anywhere near the same
535.32s: amount of build out further out in time
536.88s: so it looks like we're back to the good
538.52s: old play the front move here which is
541.52s: always interesting to see now last thing
543.52s: I want to take a look at quick is I
545.80s: guess we'll just zoom this in all the
547.44s: way and let's take a look and see if
549.88s: there's any interesting options
551.68s: transactions that have happened today in
554.84s: GameStop so let's go to
557.04s: today and we'll keep the mid as well and
560.28s: I'm going to keep the puts off and let's
562.56s: just eyeball this shall
565.32s: we
568.20s: okay um
570.44s: um I don't
573.88s: see I don't see a lot that's like
576.60s: jumping out at me is
579.84s: crazy there definitely are some decent
582.12s: Siz trades but these are like pretty
583.92s: small relative to what we typically see
585.76s: right 154,000 150t 115 103 those are all
589.76s: relatively small trades let's take the
591.36s: take a look at the put side real quick
592.48s: just see if there's any bigp put
594.84s: transactions no so relatively quiet on
597.88s: the options front now with that tells me
599.72s: is that most of what we're seeing from
601.68s: the options trade side of things is that
604.60s: they're just a bunch of different people
607.36s: playing a bunch of different size
609.20s: positions so there's not like these
610.52s: really big trade builds so really really
613.56s: interesting to see this moving GameStop
615.12s: as always if you guys have any
617.20s: information as to why this week why it
619.76s: looks like 29 no is piping up I'd love
622.84s: to hear about it because yeah normally
625.04s: days that have quiet Market periods like
627.04s: Thanksgiving these weeks generally tend
629.00s: to be a little a little bit more quiet
630.08s: but as per usual GameStop tends to Buck
632.40s: the trend so let me know what you
634.80s: think's going on and then also um how
637.44s: we're positioning into earnings because
639.12s: that's another thing that's coming up
640.20s: real soon let me know if you need
642.12s: anything be an outlier I'll see you guys
643.56s: later
