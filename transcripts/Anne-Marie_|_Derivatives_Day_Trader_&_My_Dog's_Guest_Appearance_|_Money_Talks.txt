1.36s: all right so we got the uh recording
4.00s: going i know it actually says your name
6.32s: down there in the bottom left is
7.60s: info at thetradingbook.com but um i know
11.44s: you have a hyphenated name anne-marie do
13.28s: you go by one or the other
17.04s: yeah and my last name is latvian and so
20.32s: everybody has a really tough time with
22.48s: it
23.68s: yeah it's banned like rubber band
26.88s: or marching band or whatever the i and
29.84s: the y
30.40s: are are silent what's the origin of that
33.28s: latvian
34.80s: oh wow that's cool yeah man you don't
37.76s: run into a lot of
38.80s: folks especially yeah that's very cool
43.12s: um and then i didn't expect to go down
46.40s: this rabbit hole but i gotta ask
47.92s: um did your were your folks from there
50.80s: or grandparents from there i'm curious
52.48s: how
52.88s: how you ended up we had really
56.00s: that name is
59.28s: four generations back and then so we've
62.64s: just had a lot of males in the family
64.48s: that got it the name came down but
67.76s: we're really eastern european
70.96s: and uh mediterranean okay right and so
74.88s: we are a little bit of i wouldn't be
76.96s: surprised if there was some turkish
78.48s: floating around in there but
80.48s: we haven't done you know 23andme or or
83.44s: oh
83.76s: retro.com yet
86.32s: [Music]
91.36s: yeah no no absolutely not i um i'm
94.72s: primarily german and polish we're a dime
97.84s: a dozen you know you can't
99.20s: find well it depends where you are yeah
101.76s: i guess that's true
102.96s: i'm thinking you throw a rock you're
104.64s: gonna hit one but
106.32s: um anytime i find people from different
108.72s: areas
109.52s: um i like to learn a little bit about it
111.52s: so thanks for uh thanks for sharing um
114.56s: and then otherwise thank you for uh
116.80s: coming on and chatting with us for a
118.24s: little bit and welcome to the channel so
120.48s: you and i were doing a little bit of you
122.00s: know just level setting before we
123.76s: started the recording
124.88s: just talking about kind of the purpose
126.24s: of things and whatnot and just to
128.00s: recap the idea is just to have a
130.72s: conversation to explore mostly you
132.96s: and kind of your approach to the markets
134.88s: and trading
136.16s: this way whoever is watching the videos
138.96s: they have the ability to just
140.16s: see some different perspectives and i
141.60s: think that that's really powerful
143.44s: as folks are trying to figure out or
145.60s: even redefine
146.88s: you know their their approach to trading
148.56s: so if you don't mind i would
150.32s: love to start there and just get a you
152.80s: know broad understanding of
154.72s: you know pretty much when you started
156.88s: trading what got you into it
159.52s: you know um we're a family of business
162.24s: owners and so
163.28s: we've no really maybe we've had two
166.96s: people work for other people
168.48s: but most of us have been just business
170.80s: owners for a lot of generations and i'd
172.72s: had
173.52s: a couple of companies i started as a
176.08s: neuroscience researcher
177.92s: but that doesn't pay very much because
180.24s: you're you know low man on the totem
182.08s: pole and
182.72s: all i had was my background work in
184.72s: statistics
185.92s: and so i actually took a hard left turn
189.84s: and went into recruiting and recruiting
192.16s: technical people like myself
193.52s: statisticians neuroscientists
195.84s: and then that moved into programmers
198.96s: and um that i.t space and so i had
203.12s: a recruiting company for 14 years and i
206.16s: really
207.28s: was very tired of always
210.96s: being on and in front of people
214.32s: all the time and in a space of
217.76s: convincing someone to you know consider
221.12s: your options and then somebody flaking
223.04s: out
223.60s: or you know somebody
227.04s: popping positive with a cocaine screen
230.64s: wait did you know that so you know all
233.60s: those sorts of things that
234.96s: happen out of the blue i was just very
237.76s: tired it's an exhausting
240.24s: place to work but i learned a lot about
243.12s: people
244.72s: a lot and so that combined with my
249.12s: statistics and my background in
253.52s: behavioral mathematics i just said you
256.32s: know what i want to do something
257.44s: different
257.84s: my husband said hey why don't you
260.88s: look at this let's go check this out and
263.92s: so
264.88s: we saw trading seminar i can't even
267.44s: remember where it was it's been so long
269.36s: ago
270.48s: uh 2005 and i thought to myself
274.64s: how hard could this be because of course
276.96s: everything was in hindsight
278.72s: they were drawing the little pictures
280.16s: and they said no this is where you'd buy
282.32s: and this is where you would sell and
284.40s: i thought man even a monkey could do
287.20s: this
287.68s: i'm perfect so i
291.04s: said to myself i will take
294.56s: uh all the money that i've been saving
298.08s: and working with having a business for
301.52s: 14 years and i'm gonna just
305.20s: absolutely go straight into the market
307.44s: and
309.20s: i can do this i can do anything right a
311.52s: lot of confidence in myself
313.04s: lost millions of dollars
316.48s: because i figured out that
320.48s: it's not as easy and that's why they
324.16s: have the pyramid of people
325.92s: on the top and people on the bottom it's
328.32s: really fat
329.20s: on the bottom really skinny on the top
331.92s: and
332.32s: so i i really spent a couple of years
336.32s: failing abysmally and
339.44s: then um i stepped back and i
342.72s: tried to figure out wait what what do
345.20s: you know to be true
346.72s: what is anecdotal
349.84s: and what is statistically significant
355.12s: and what i found out through the years
357.60s: is most of the stuff that we think about
360.08s: in terms of giving us direction it's
362.48s: anecdotal
363.84s: it's and by that i mean it's the closest
367.20s: thing that you can pick up and go oh you
368.96s: know what the last two times i saw that
370.80s: this happened
371.68s: right and so obviously that's the
373.84s: relationship
375.52s: one of the best books that i ever read
378.24s: was the book thinking fast and slow
380.72s: by daniel i love that book wasn't it
383.52s: fantastic
384.32s: my my fiance she actually turned me on
386.56s: to it um
387.92s: and she was reading it and i checked out
389.36s: it is a good book it is
391.28s: so so good yeah but it it made me
395.04s: see that those two systems the fast
398.00s: thinking system and the
399.60s: slow thinking system constantly
403.20s: i could see it warring for me personally
406.00s: where i would want to jump to the quick
408.00s: answer because we're rewarded for quick
410.88s: answers
411.44s: in society in general slow answers we
414.88s: normally have
416.08s: those folks in a room off by themselves
418.96s: and they
419.92s: do that heart crunching data for us but
422.08s: it's very difficult
424.08s: for us to go one two three four
427.20s: five and not want to go one two five
429.76s: right because we wanna
431.28s: jump to the end of everything because we
434.00s: wanna get
434.64s: to a solution our mind another
437.92s: really great neuroscientist is a guy
440.88s: named
441.20s: david eagleman and he's a professor
444.32s: out of the university of texas at
446.96s: houston
447.84s: okay and he does a lot of neuroscience
450.88s: work and he says listen the brain
453.92s: does not like anything that's not
457.68s: solid so you can look at a landscape
462.32s: and your brain will actually only see
466.00s: your mind will only connect two or three
468.80s: things
469.52s: and your brain fills in the rest with
471.68s: whatever else
473.04s: it thinks ought to be back there right
475.84s: and so we have this
477.52s: tendency to believe that we're seeing a
481.04s: full picture
481.92s: in the moment in time so when after the
485.20s: fact we go there and we go why didn't i
487.28s: see that
488.24s: it could be that your brain never saw it
489.84s: in the first place it just
491.44s: glossed over that edge it's sort of like
494.64s: that
495.60s: um have you have you read that quick
498.40s: little book called the invisible gorilla
501.12s: oh yeah yeah i saw the video on it but
503.76s: yeah
504.40s: the book was really about how much the
507.36s: brain
508.56s: can miss when it's not uh paying
512.08s: attention to a specific
514.40s: thing and and how eyewitness testimony
517.20s: is like
518.08s: the worst testimony right right ever
521.60s: and so that notion of all of that
525.68s: started making me think wait a second
529.52s: i'm looking at a landscape in real time
533.76s: making decisions in that real time space
536.80s: and then after the fact because
539.20s: everything is static
540.72s: and not dynamic it's no longer moving
544.00s: my brain says oh well obviously this
547.28s: must have been there then and i should
548.96s: have seen this and this is what i need
550.88s: to do
551.84s: and so they're really two completely
554.40s: disconnected systems
556.32s: right and when you're an active day
557.92s: trader like me i was
559.84s: just losing gobs of money before my
564.40s: husband
565.04s: said to me i think you should stop
568.48s: because i'm not really sure you know
570.08s: what you're doing
571.28s: which you know my best and greatest
575.52s: confidant
576.40s: is my my husband and so when he said
579.92s: that to me
580.80s: i was vastly offended but
584.08s: it was absolutely true absolutely true
588.16s: and it sent me on that journey of
591.36s: pulling in all the things i'd learned
593.84s: about
594.96s: how people were from 14 years in the
597.52s: recruiting business and then pulling
600.24s: all the mathematics of hey
603.60s: how do you actually solve a problem you
606.00s: go one
606.88s: two three four and where the area is
610.72s: gray what you do is have a series of if
613.92s: then statements
615.12s: right right so that's how i started
617.84s: looking at the market
619.76s: and one of the most fabulous things
623.12s: i ever read was
627.20s: um the biography of john boyd
630.88s: who was the curse yes
634.00s: and the ooda loop is a part of my every
637.92s: day motion you gotta be a marine then
640.64s: because that's like one of our
642.32s: central principles is you know marines
646.24s: were the only people that showed up to
647.92s: his funeral
649.36s: nobody from the air force did so i just
652.16s: love the guy
653.12s: because he just i mean
657.44s: the focal strength to do
661.28s: to make something so incredibly complex
664.24s: just come
664.88s: down into these tight things that go one
667.92s: two three
668.64s: four and then stop and make sure you
672.48s: go through hey you've observed but did
674.88s: you actually orient
676.40s: and that's what we don't do we observe
679.04s: all the time
680.24s: but it's that orientation that gives us
682.56s: trouble oh we just crossed over the 50.
684.96s: yeah well that's great is that 50
686.56s: trending up or down
688.32s: is the overall motion of the market
690.56s: coming off of a deep support
692.48s: or a hard resistance there are things
695.28s: that will
696.08s: shift what the cross of that 50 will
699.44s: mean
699.92s: and so for me it always comes back to
705.36s: listen can you see what the players are
708.88s: doing
709.92s: if you can't tell what the players are
712.80s: doing you better sit on your hands
715.28s: because the number one thing for me is
718.08s: i'll think to myself all right here's
719.76s: what you're thinking you're thinking
721.20s: that when it gets to here
723.04s: a bunch of sellers are going to come in
725.52s: and if they come in
727.20s: then it's going to drive it down to this
729.04s: level of support
730.56s: and you'll be able to turn around and
732.08s: move back up with the direction
733.84s: of the overall trend and so
737.12s: i used to plan everything out and then
739.28s: take the trade and then go
741.12s: what happened because i was never
743.20s: thinking
744.40s: about my opponent
748.24s: what was the other side of the equation
751.60s: doing to circumvent my path
755.44s: to where it was that i was going and so
758.40s: for me
760.40s: i've stopped looking at the market in
762.72s: terms of
764.48s: indicators but more of okay
767.76s: a lot of traders accomplished x today
771.20s: like for instance in the futures we had
774.00s: a support edge that
775.60s: really came down and tested hard
778.96s: well all the sellers are done because
781.04s: they've said
782.16s: hey that was our major target we went in
786.96s: and this was our objective one two three
789.60s: four we're gonna hit
790.48s: these and we get to here and it's gonna
792.80s: be mission accomplished
794.88s: we're out of there right and so
797.92s: when that happens the balance will shift
800.56s: between
801.76s: the buyers gaining more force because
804.80s: the sellers have accomplished their goal
806.56s: they're headed back up the hill
808.64s: to find the next resistance spot that
810.80s: they can do it again
812.24s: and so for me it's always about the game
815.28s: of the storyboard of players as opposed
818.80s: to
819.84s: look at this crossing this look at that
822.16s: crossing that
823.68s: that storyboard helps me
826.84s: synthesize um
830.24s: much more accurately than
833.92s: simply looking at a group of technicals
836.24s: or just looking at price
838.72s: gotcha yeah that's that's definitely
840.64s: interesting and you started dovetailing
842.48s: kind of into another topic i want to hit
844.80s: before i do that you you talked about
848.64s: your star
849.76s: and it's fascinating i think
853.36s: because you started with a different
855.68s: paradigm than most
857.20s: folks specifically on my channel
860.40s: which is you started with capital that
862.88s: you had built
863.84s: from over a decade of running your own
866.56s: business whereas
867.84s: you know most folks that i end up
869.68s: talking to they're starting with nothing
871.28s: you know and they're trying to save so
873.20s: if it's okay with you i'd love to
874.96s: explore that paradigm just a little bit
877.20s: because i think it's really unique
879.28s: um so one of the things i would be
881.20s: really curious to understand
883.12s: is you know you went to that uh trading
886.56s: seminar you decided that you wanted to
888.08s: give it a shot
889.52s: when you first started trading what was
893.04s: your general approach if you could just
896.72s: summarize it i don't need specifics or
898.64s: anything wow
900.32s: you know um
904.88s: i would i was sort of
908.08s: like a cocker spaniel looking at a bunch
911.52s: of birds
912.08s: outside the window sure and so it was
915.44s: oh i'll try that i'll try this i'll try
917.92s: that
918.48s: and so although i thought i had
922.00s: a strategy i really didn't right
925.44s: right i did not approach the market in a
928.80s: systematic way
930.08s: i thought about the market
933.76s: and i i really only realized it in
937.12s: hindsight but i thought about the market
939.04s: as a little bit of a slot machine
940.88s: sure i thought hey this guy's talking
944.80s: about this
946.80s: and i love the option space
949.84s: i think options will
953.12s: turn um
957.44s: a flat surface into a
961.20s: fully three-dimensional topology
964.40s: we can see all the landscape and just
968.08s: everything and you can move and
970.00s: manipulate gears
971.28s: absolutely loved it and so i began
974.64s: playing with
975.28s: options not realizing
979.52s: how much damage
982.64s: you can do to yourself see because i had
984.80s: a lot of
985.76s: cash right so when you have a lot of
988.96s: cash
989.76s: you lose some of it and you go well that
992.16s: stinks
992.88s: but it's okay i got it right and then it
995.68s: happens again
996.40s: and you know that's terrible but i got
999.12s: it
999.84s: and you almost
1003.84s: um you forget how long it took to
1007.20s: put it away
1010.88s: which was a travesty right because it
1012.96s: took me
1014.80s: 18 months to lose millions of dollars
1018.40s: and you know six years
1021.44s: right to get back to break even so
1024.64s: it was you know i wouldn't recommend it
1027.12s: to a single soul
1028.08s: frankly right um
1031.28s: truly i was just as
1036.84s: uh loose
1039.60s: with my risk as say the person who comes
1042.80s: in with
1043.68s: a thousand dollars and says hey you know
1045.84s: i wanna
1046.96s: i wanna turn this into two thousand
1048.64s: bucks by the end of the month i'm like
1050.16s: well
1050.72s: good luck with that one right but not
1053.52s: that it can't happen
1055.12s: but people forget that risk and reward
1057.60s: is on a thread
1059.28s: intimately yes
1062.40s: and so when you look at those things and
1064.96s: you okay well i want my reward to be
1067.12s: this well your risk is not only going to
1070.00s: expand by that same amount but by even
1072.64s: more
1073.60s: and so you know the thing that
1077.92s: so what i did poorly was i
1081.64s: overestimated my ability i
1085.64s: overestimated the knowledge that i
1088.72s: thought i had
1089.84s: [Music]
1091.44s: i overestimated the fact that i thought
1095.36s: my
1095.76s: intellect could take me through the
1098.64s: emotional space
1100.00s: listen there's nothing there's not a
1102.40s: worse gut
1103.20s: punch than really studying and putting a
1107.52s: position
1108.08s: in and it going absolutely
1112.32s: sideways right and so that
1115.92s: sort of you know all of that
1119.20s: if i could build a list of please don't
1122.56s: do this it would be the first 18 months
1125.68s: of my career and
1126.88s: every single thing i did the only thing
1129.36s: i've never done
1130.88s: is going all in on margin or i probably
1133.76s: wouldn't be here today
1135.04s: right i stopped with enough
1138.64s: capital that i didn't blow anything up
1141.44s: and so
1142.40s: i could go all right start start over
1145.44s: and i would start and go okay what is it
1147.52s: that
1148.40s: you know to be true what simple things
1152.72s: can you look at and go okay when this
1154.72s: happens
1156.00s: and the probability of this happening is
1158.88s: higher based on x
1160.56s: and so everything i went right back to
1163.36s: my statistical background
1165.04s: and said let's just look at this as
1168.56s: a game of cards a game of probabilities
1172.24s: a game of dice
1173.68s: dice rolling and just take a look at
1176.32s: these correlations
1178.48s: not causations but correlations
1182.64s: and work from that and so that really
1185.36s: has been my bread
1186.40s: and butter it's what's allowed me to
1190.48s: stay in and stay green
1193.92s: and continually trend up the biggest
1196.56s: thing that's happening right now in the
1198.24s: markets though
1199.36s: is there's so much intraday volatility
1203.12s: that even if you know where the cycles
1205.52s: are going to run
1207.28s: if you don't get in at just the right
1209.28s: spot
1211.12s: you're going to sit on a heavy bit of
1213.84s: risk
1214.96s: and so making my cycles
1218.56s: just a little bit smaller these days
1220.96s: because
1222.56s: i think the market is
1226.16s: different than i've ever seen it
1229.44s: it's funny so as you were kind of
1231.76s: sharing some of that there's a
1234.40s: i start to get a kick out of these
1236.32s: segments because for folks that have
1238.24s: done this a long time
1240.32s: you start to hear a lot of the same
1241.76s: things and it's it's fun because you and
1244.08s: i have never
1244.80s: talked before right and a lot of the
1247.28s: stuff that you were just talking about
1248.56s: is stuff that
1249.60s: i talk about and pretty much everybody
1252.00s: that's come on the channel so far has
1253.36s: talked about
1254.00s: risk and reward their relationship
1256.32s: things like that and
1257.60s: one of the things that i also found
1259.20s: interesting is you know when
1260.88s: you're sharing a little bit about your
1262.40s: original approach where it was just kind
1264.40s: of like shotgun blast you know all over
1266.00s: the place
1266.56s: the different things yes i i find that
1269.52s: very
1270.00s: interesting because i think for just
1273.12s: about
1273.68s: all of us because i i started with like
1275.92s: no money
1277.04s: and for a lot of us that first starting
1279.04s: out it's like we were doing the same
1281.04s: exact thing just with less money
1282.80s: yeah and you kind of hit on that as well
1285.20s: with the one to two thousand dollar
1286.80s: example
1287.60s: yeah so i think that um it's interesting
1290.72s: to hear you say that
1291.92s: now the one thing i would be really
1294.56s: interested to learn about
1296.16s: is obviously you had your
1299.68s: um your trade logs or you know your
1302.32s: records whatever
1304.00s: and then at some point your husband's
1305.60s: the one that said well maybe we should
1307.04s: shift gears a little bit and try
1308.32s: something different
1309.52s: i'm curious like what was the aha moment
1312.32s: for you where you started to like regain
1314.48s: your confidence after you realized that
1316.64s: okay what i'm doing right now is not
1317.84s: working
1318.64s: so let me try something new when when
1321.12s: did that like click for you
1324.32s: the clicking
1328.24s: it's it's that tumblr that keeps going
1331.04s: and going
1331.60s: because there's a click and then you go
1333.28s: oh wait i think i got it
1335.04s: yeah okay no i don't really have it and
1337.68s: then i
1338.24s: oh this is it okay no
1341.60s: not exactly so it's um
1345.20s: it's sort of a plateau event i'll tell
1347.76s: you
1348.88s: what made me and my husband say
1352.48s: hold the phone you've got to
1355.76s: pump the brakes here i was trading
1359.12s: earnings into um
1363.92s: they make the da vinci machine uh what
1366.72s: is their name
1367.68s: uh crud
1370.80s: anyways starts with an i anyway
1374.56s: so i'm trading this yes
1377.92s: that's it isrg thank you
1381.60s: i know i just had to sit for a minute
1384.64s: okay so um this was really the worst
1388.24s: trade of my trading career
1390.48s: it i went into earnings everybody was
1392.32s: like oh it's great i mean i even
1394.16s: called the investor um
1397.01s: [Music]
1398.16s: the in the investor relations line
1400.32s: they're like okay this could be great
1403.52s: i'm ready for it i am so heavy
1407.28s: and i'm short puts and long calls in a
1411.04s: synthetic
1412.80s: long and
1416.80s: they opened up a hundred dollars a share
1420.40s: lower
1422.64s: and so literally it's that
1426.00s: deer in the headlights and then i
1428.40s: couldn't move
1429.12s: and the whole day and then it was the
1430.96s: end of the week
1432.32s: and um i was talking to my husband and
1436.24s: he was like
1438.48s: yeah this is not going well and so
1442.00s: that made me go okay you got to stop and
1444.48s: so the aha moments were really
1447.60s: aha face the fact look at yourself in
1451.04s: the mirror and go
1453.12s: you think you know what's going on but
1454.96s: you don't really know what's going on or
1456.56s: you'd have different results
1458.00s: i think every single one of us has gone
1460.16s: through that i just
1461.04s: right to identify with you there because
1463.52s: i yes
1465.20s: absolutely and so that was the first
1468.40s: thing and then i said
1469.36s: all right you gotta trim this down and
1471.92s: one
1473.44s: you've got to figure out what i had
1476.64s: broken
1477.20s: all my emotional capital i had no
1479.12s: emotional capital left
1480.80s: meaning i was so broken spirited
1486.24s: that i actually had to turn my
1489.60s: sound off on my machine because if i
1491.84s: heard the ding
1493.84s: it was like pavlov's dog i was like oh
1496.00s: this is going to be bad
1497.52s: right so i literally turned it off even
1500.08s: today
1501.68s: so many years later i still do not have
1504.72s: sound
1505.36s: on that's my machine for telling me a
1508.72s: trade
1509.36s: i will have a flashing pop-up
1512.84s: uh-huh
1517.20s: yeah very very very far back
1520.40s: but i don't want to hear it again so
1522.96s: that
1524.16s: and then i said to myself all right just
1527.12s: because
1529.44s: you haven't done this right doesn't mean
1531.84s: that you can't find out the right way to
1533.92s: do it because
1535.44s: you know what i am one of those never
1538.56s: say die people and honestly
1542.32s: to have grit and perseverance
1545.68s: and be oh i love the doggo
1548.72s: love the dog i was he's just sitting
1551.20s: there chewing my hands so
1553.20s: you ended up so great
1556.32s: so great so if you don't have that grit
1560.00s: and the market beats you up because it
1561.84s: will beat you up even when you get
1563.60s: good it'll still beat you up right it's
1566.80s: sort of like
1568.08s: being a great golfer you're
1573.52s: still going to shank it right you're
1575.44s: still going to kick it in the sand
1577.84s: it's how you triage yourself out of that
1580.48s: that makes you the expert
1582.56s: how do you take that whoa this thing is
1585.68s: going to be
1586.32s: bad what do i do right now to fix it
1589.44s: that's where that expertise comes from
1591.68s: and so you're always going to be
1593.04s: battling that sense of am i really good
1596.32s: enough is this
1597.68s: am i do i really know what this is and
1600.16s: then
1601.12s: you know a lot of us
1604.24s: need to feel like
1607.60s: we can be successful but
1610.72s: there's there are anchors in the back
1613.28s: right
1613.76s: little childhood sky cab baggage
1617.04s: that will be you know you're not good
1620.80s: enough
1621.36s: you're not you're not and so you've
1624.56s: got to look at yourself in the mirror
1626.96s: and here's the great thing
1628.80s: if you've literally ever done this look
1631.52s: in the mirror
1633.12s: and try to tell yourself a lie
1637.52s: you can't you can lie but
1640.96s: the solar plexus will go
1644.16s: and you'll know okay this whole body
1647.92s: this is a lie i know this is a lie so if
1650.56s: you
1651.76s: if you can look at yourself in the
1653.92s: mirror and
1655.20s: say exactly what you are without using
1658.80s: language that is deriding
1661.92s: or demeaning and say
1665.12s: okay what you know is that you can put
1668.40s: the work in
1669.36s: right if you've got a good work ethic
1672.40s: and you work and work and work but work
1675.52s: smart
1676.40s: you're going to get to where you want to
1677.76s: go you just have to look at yourself in
1679.84s: the mirror and say
1680.80s: today i'm going to work smart
1684.56s: believe it and do it and i and i think
1686.96s: that you
1687.68s: you hit a really important point that i
1690.32s: i also
1691.60s: think it's really just
1694.80s: it's irreplaceable in people's
1696.96s: progression as a trader where we go
1698.96s: through that
1699.76s: that phase where you feel like you know
1701.12s: what you're doing and then you start to
1702.96s: come across signs that that
1704.48s: you know you might not have the same
1706.88s: handle that you think you do and
1708.72s: i love you know your discussion just
1711.20s: kind of about that self analysis
1712.96s: yes it's one of the one of my favorite
1715.76s: things to do is
1716.80s: just kind of read through different
1718.64s: white papers and research
1720.80s: on the trading community at large i find
1723.44s: it very interesting
1725.04s: and he wanted to read anything like that
1727.20s: i would really like to
1728.48s: oh yeah i literally can send you a ton
1730.64s: actually uh
1731.68s: google has a super super cool feature
1734.72s: where you can literally
1736.08s: search white papers collegiate articles
1737.92s: stuff like that on a topic that you want
1740.56s: um so it's literally an entire
1742.40s: repository of different research that
1744.40s: different folks have done on different
1745.84s: aspects of trading and
1747.20s: one of the most common pieces it's
1748.88s: exactly something i'm
1750.56s: sure you know exists where you know we
1753.36s: want to
1754.08s: really focus on the positive events and
1756.56s: we kind of want to pretend the negative
1758.16s: event didn't happen
1759.60s: right and then that leads to kind of
1761.60s: that sustained
1762.72s: space of losing right um and i
1766.64s: just i really identify with that
1768.16s: self-analysis portion that's one of the
1770.48s: one of the main things i think goes into
1773.28s: being
1773.76s: a long-term trader is the ability to
1776.56s: kind of agnostically take a look at what
1778.56s: you're doing and
1779.36s: yes be honest with yourself because
1781.28s: otherwise i like to say it a lot the
1783.60s: whole trading thing
1784.80s: it's a it's a 1v1 sort of sports you
1787.52s: versus yourself
1788.40s: so yes you can lie all you want that's
1790.56s: fine but money's not going to grow from
1792.24s: that's exactly right yeah you kind of
1794.16s: that's exactly right
1795.36s: you kind of have to get the ego out of
1796.72s: the way early so that you can
1798.80s: focus more on the growth yeah well you
1800.96s: know the hard thing
1802.08s: sorry no please no no i think the hard
1805.12s: thing for us
1806.00s: is to look at the difficult things or
1808.72s: the things that we aren't doing right
1810.40s: and not judge ourselves
1813.60s: the judging event creates
1817.36s: an internal space of mental derision
1821.28s: you idiot you you what the heck
1824.24s: were you looking at
1825.28s: that sort of thing if you
1829.76s: if you say to yourself all right if my
1832.72s: goal is always self-improvement and we
1834.64s: know
1835.12s: that trading makes us better human
1837.44s: beings right
1839.20s: it does because it makes us look at
1841.20s: ourselves and go why
1842.96s: did you just do that and so
1847.04s: if you can look at yourself without
1850.72s: judgment and say listen
1854.24s: this you did incorrectly let's look at
1857.36s: why
1857.84s: right and you strip that
1862.00s: judgment finger-pointing thing that we
1864.08s: have a tendency to do
1866.32s: because we we're just terrible to
1869.44s: ourselves
1870.80s: and my philosophy is always i tell my
1874.40s: kids
1874.96s: all the time listen do your best
1878.48s: not to have negative self-talk because
1882.48s: there's going to be somebody out there
1884.48s: that is going to
1885.76s: just they can't wait to knock you off
1889.20s: your game yep don't you be doing it yeah
1892.40s: let them do it you don't do it and so
1896.40s: and i talk a big game i'll say but i
1899.28s: still say to myself
1900.96s: you were just an idiot right there but
1903.04s: the question is
1904.24s: when you get back at the end of the day
1906.40s: and you do the homework
1907.68s: which is super important you got to do
1910.00s: that homework a lot of us
1911.36s: do not like the homework part of trading
1914.40s: but it's sort of like being a
1915.84s: professional athlete and never going to
1917.68s: the practice field i make that
1919.36s: exact parallel all the time i i
1922.24s: literally just
1923.12s: quoted um uh uh ronnie coleman the other
1927.20s: day
1927.60s: you know he has that i love the saying i
1930.16s: like to work out and his saying is you
1931.60s: know everybody wants to be a bodybuilder
1933.12s: but nobody
1934.00s: don't nobody want to lift this heavy ass
1935.60s: weight it's the same thing
1937.20s: everybody is ready to make a buck yeah
1940.24s: nobody wants to put an orc it's
1942.96s: absolutely true
1944.48s: and so because it's not exciting it's
1947.76s: boring to look over that sort of stuff
1951.60s: but i gotta tell you it pays off in
1953.52s: space and so
1955.60s: you know when you when you think to
1958.72s: yourself
1959.60s: what's my edge you know we all we all
1961.60s: have to have that edge
1963.36s: because we are trading against the
1965.76s: smartest people
1966.88s: and the fastest machines in the world
1970.08s: and so we have to respect
1971.84s: our opponents in terms of saying
1974.88s: all right what's what are you going to
1976.48s: put up have up your sleeve here that
1978.88s: i'm going to see and i'm going to be
1980.80s: able because i have a skiff
1983.04s: and you've got a battleship i can move a
1985.28s: lot faster than you
1986.88s: and that's going to be my edge and so
1990.40s: if i'm looking at that and i go what
1992.88s: what is that
1993.76s: edge the biggest part of it is going to
1995.92s: be your mental strength
1997.76s: in terms of saying all right
2000.80s: have i framed this out to say
2004.48s: if i'm right then this will happen if
2006.96s: i'm wrong then this will happen
2009.52s: and if i'm wrong and i see this going to
2012.00s: happen i have a choice
2013.68s: in between the gap of holy cow
2017.04s: i just see that i might be wrong what's
2019.68s: the triage here
2021.04s: do i cut and run or
2024.08s: do i figure out some sort of hedging
2027.12s: event and most of us have a trading plan
2031.36s: and it goes like this i'm going to buy
2033.92s: here
2034.48s: and my stop is going to be here and my
2036.48s: target's going to be here
2038.24s: and what is that military saying
2042.40s: no plan survives first contact yeah
2046.40s: yes there we have right yeah that's
2049.36s: trading
2050.40s: in a snap right so
2053.52s: we get into that and
2056.80s: we this we think we have a trading plan
2059.12s: because we know our
2060.00s: stop we think we know our entry and we
2062.08s: think we know our target and that's
2064.16s: that's not a plan at all the plan is
2066.64s: okay
2067.84s: uh what if you come off the rise and
2070.32s: there's a bunch of stuff there that you
2071.84s: didn't think you're gonna see
2073.52s: so everything is about
2076.56s: contingency planning but at the same
2079.76s: time
2080.96s: not second guessing right
2084.00s: there's a difference right to orient and
2087.36s: observe or to observe and then orient
2090.72s: orienting doesn't mean second guessing
2093.84s: it means always looking at the landscape
2097.52s: and saying
2098.48s: has anything changed to materially
2101.44s: affect
2102.48s: my initial trajectory in this case
2106.16s: i love it and slow and easy
2110.00s: slowly i used to throw 50
2114.00s: things of spaghetti at the wall and
2116.00s: whichever ones
2117.44s: hit were great now i'm much more
2120.72s: of a sniper rifle approach
2124.00s: right i'm just uber focused
2127.68s: one or two things and
2131.20s: you know it's a grind
2134.64s: if you do it the rewards are great
2138.24s: but the work is intense
2142.48s: the work is there yeah you hit on a
2145.36s: couple good things
2146.64s: that i i definitely um i definitely
2150.00s: identify with
2151.12s: one of one of the main things is you're
2153.28s: kind of just talking about
2155.20s: um is the idea of just being thoughtful
2158.08s: on
2158.96s: what you're going to choose to kind of
2161.76s: expose yourself to
2163.36s: yes and that's one of the things that i
2165.76s: talk a lot about
2166.96s: and at the end of the day i think the
2169.28s: number one
2170.08s: trait of a long-term trader is they're a
2173.44s: risk manager
2174.40s: that's it's got to come first and like
2176.56s: you were talking about with your
2177.60s: contingency plans the two things you
2179.52s: mentioned
2180.56s: adding a hedge or exiting the trade both
2183.84s: risk management just a really really
2185.84s: important
2187.44s: concept for people to kind of get their
2189.44s: their arms around and
2190.72s: yeah um i'm glad you brought those up
2193.28s: now
2194.00s: we are coming up we have about 20
2196.56s: minutes left
2197.36s: so what i would love to do is dig
2200.56s: a little bit more into kind of just your
2202.72s: general trading style what do you like
2204.40s: to do
2204.88s: you know you can go as far in depth or
2206.56s: as not far in depth as you want but i
2208.80s: would love to just learn a little bit
2210.16s: more about your approach to the markets
2212.88s: sure um i like
2215.92s: i trade the futures because of the
2217.60s: leverage i love the leverage
2220.00s: um and you know leverage works for you
2223.68s: when you know what you're doing and
2225.20s: against you when you don't
2227.12s: or you get yourself in a pickle but i
2229.44s: like that
2230.40s: and what i've noticed is even though i
2233.44s: trade
2234.96s: intra-day several times a day
2238.16s: i always look at the following i look at
2242.32s: how did this instrument close on the
2244.72s: quarter
2245.68s: right what is the high what is the low
2247.68s: what's the open what's the close
2249.36s: how did it close last month
2253.12s: high low open close and so i'll do
2256.00s: everything and i'll map those
2257.76s: on my chart and i will not
2261.04s: count overnight trading so i will put up
2264.48s: a chart that only has
2266.48s: the regular trading hours
2269.84s: yes and so that's where the heaviest
2272.56s: volume is going to be
2273.68s: except for things like gold and maybe
2276.40s: oil once in a while because you know
2278.00s: those are all
2278.80s: traded across the pond also so when we
2282.08s: take a look at that
2283.60s: i will always look at a chart and go
2286.96s: i'll establish prevailing trend
2290.88s: and then near-term behavior so
2294.40s: for instance um let's
2297.44s: pick something that we both might have
2300.72s: familiarity with you pick
2302.56s: i was gonna say any any future i i trade
2305.04s: them pretty much daily myself so
2307.36s: so let's take a look at the es okay okay
2310.72s: and so the es had
2314.24s: um a spike up into
2318.60s: 37 14 or 37
2321.76s: 16 a couple of days ago and that
2325.04s: actually was uh the gamma traders
2328.80s: sort of told us what was going on with
2331.20s: this uh
2333.52s: what there's a really side note there's
2336.56s: a very interesting
2337.92s: i'm gonna send you some stuff on gamma
2339.52s: cool so that you can
2341.44s: see where they're going to pull
2345.36s: price to before it collapses
2348.88s: and so this month it was 3 700
2352.96s: and i went and looked at the option
2355.12s: chains and i said
2356.16s: yeah but we've got about 37 10
2359.76s: to 37 15. i see a lot of
2363.68s: call action right there i bet you we
2365.52s: stretch over this 3 700.
2368.08s: and so we put the high in and so my
2371.76s: question as i come into the next day is
2374.00s: always the following
2375.76s: am i seeing strength or weakness
2378.88s: relative to the prior date that means
2381.68s: it's
2382.00s: strength if it's up over the close
2385.68s: of the prior date and is he got a toy
2389.20s: yeah i just saw him like pop on he's
2390.96s: just whipping that thing around
2392.56s: sorry oh no i i do i absolutely
2396.08s: love animals so um
2399.12s: we take a look at the strength the
2400.56s: moment it starts losing either the high
2402.96s: or the close
2403.92s: we have to think about why right
2407.28s: well why does price lose a level anyway
2410.24s: it means that the
2411.52s: pressure of sellers is more
2415.20s: than the pressure of buyers now there's
2417.04s: this storyboard
2418.24s: where people go you know for every
2420.64s: seller there's a buyer
2422.56s: yes of course we know that to be true
2425.52s: however
2426.72s: there are sellers that have the ability
2429.36s: to sell
2430.08s: five contracts and sellers that have the
2432.72s: ability to sell
2433.76s: 5 000 contracts and so
2437.84s: that's what we're looking at from that
2439.60s: strength perspective
2440.96s: the moment weakness begins to occur
2444.16s: i will start saying all right if the
2447.20s: buyers are
2448.24s: finished with getting to the top of the
2450.84s: range
2452.16s: they'll pull backwards and they'll go i
2454.88s: need to go find
2456.00s: a value spot i don't know where it is
2459.20s: but it might be the prior day is open
2462.24s: it might be the weekly open but those
2464.80s: levels i have plotted
2466.56s: on my chart got it and so i will simply
2469.84s: trade from one stair step to the other
2472.96s: and i'll get in and i'll get out
2476.32s: i used to run cycles where i would go
2478.96s: okay i know it's going to
2480.24s: fade a little bit and then bounce i'm
2483.28s: not really sure where it's going to fade
2485.04s: but i know i've got
2486.32s: a fairly good risk threshold and what's
2488.48s: been happening is
2489.76s: the volatility expansion from the algos
2493.12s: has been brutal
2497.16s: absolutely i mean flying through support
2500.72s: levels
2502.00s: and not recovering for two days which is
2504.32s: oh right yeah
2505.60s: you know terrible i terrible and so
2509.36s: i just moved from the one cycle to the
2512.08s: next
2512.88s: in the direction of trade and i'm always
2515.60s: thinking okay
2517.04s: emery if you're right what are you going
2520.56s: to see
2522.00s: right after you engage and if you're
2525.04s: wrong what are you going to see so you
2528.40s: better be looking for where you might be
2530.48s: wrong because that's the stuff that
2533.52s: you know slaps us when we don't even
2536.56s: notice
2537.12s: that it's we don't even know it's coming
2538.64s: and then all of a sudden bam
2540.72s: and so we have to i mean
2544.16s: you're on high alert looking for
2547.36s: something that might tell you the rug
2549.76s: might get pulled out from you
2551.52s: otherwise you just go slow and easy and
2554.64s: you get to where you're going and you
2556.32s: get out
2557.28s: my thought is because we are small
2560.72s: retail traders and we're not playing
2563.44s: with nine
2564.32s: and twelve zeros right we
2567.36s: we really want to sit back
2570.40s: and say where can i
2573.92s: dash out grab my piece of cheese and
2577.12s: then head back for cover
2578.80s: right and so i'll you know i used to
2581.68s: trade
2582.32s: maybe 30 40 50 trades a day now i
2585.76s: maybe now i do four okay so
2589.20s: and then you just load that down do you
2590.96s: just size up on those as compared to
2592.64s: when you're doing like 30 or
2594.40s: okay so the way i decide the way i
2597.20s: decide to size up
2598.56s: means have i hit an important support
2601.68s: level and i'm coming off of that support
2603.60s: level
2604.32s: if i have i could size up
2607.60s: okay if i am moving counter trend
2612.08s: i will always be half size got it
2615.36s: because you never know with counter
2617.76s: trend motion
2618.80s: sure you don't know if it's gonna so i
2621.12s: don't wanna
2622.00s: have a great morning take a counter
2624.96s: trend trade in the afternoon
2627.12s: and then end up negative for the day
2629.92s: which has happened to me more times than
2632.08s: i care to count
2633.28s: sure so i'm always looking at
2636.40s: all right if i'm going in the direction
2638.40s: of broad trend
2640.08s: meaning am i is my v web up
2643.60s: um am i moving weekly highs
2647.12s: uh if all of that is there i know in
2649.52s: very deep support zones
2651.44s: i'm going to be able to add with size to
2654.24s: move up the chain
2655.52s: right if i've come into the resistance
2658.32s: and it's
2658.96s: heavy resistance like where all those
2660.72s: gamma traders were
2662.08s: i can trade heavy
2665.28s: but otherwise
2668.72s: i will trade small and
2672.48s: often but not very often you know i
2675.36s: don't
2676.56s: my thought is always to
2679.76s: push the envelope enough
2683.52s: that you feel like you're
2686.56s: really having to be fully engaged but
2689.12s: not so much
2690.64s: that you've got butterflies in yourself
2692.32s: right that you're stressed out and
2694.00s: yeah because that what happens
2698.64s: from a biological space what happens is
2701.92s: that floods the brain with cortisol
2704.40s: right and
2705.04s: cortisol short circuits the prefrontal
2708.40s: cortex
2709.20s: right and the prefrontal cortex is where
2711.28s: we make all complex decisions
2713.28s: and so i really try to
2717.12s: not get myself in that kind of
2720.80s: space where my emotions are going to
2724.00s: make me
2725.44s: click the button when i shouldn't be yep
2728.72s: i think that that's another great point
2732.08s: do you when you're kind of doing your
2734.08s: your daily trades do you like to
2736.08s: um trade futures outright or do you
2738.40s: trade options on futures
2740.96s: i like to trade the futures outright um
2746.08s: you know i don't know why i never picked
2749.20s: the futures options
2750.48s: i know there's even more leverage there
2753.52s: i i just don't know why i haven't done
2756.48s: it
2757.92s: yeah it's i don't know it's definitely
2760.48s: something
2761.28s: um that that i like to take a look at if
2764.64s: if i'm just intraday scalping i will
2767.44s: tend to just trade the
2769.20s: future itself and the main reason there
2771.52s: is just liquidity it's a little easier
2773.44s: yeah but if i'm looking at any sort of
2776.72s: slightly
2777.28s: longer term style trade i'll typically
2780.16s: go to
2780.72s: options on futures just for the really
2783.52s: the leverage
2784.64s: in terms of settlement how
2789.44s: is the settlement does it take longer
2792.16s: for
2792.56s: the settlement of the futures option
2795.20s: versus the future
2796.72s: nope um and it depends on obviously on
2799.92s: what you're trading what the settlement
2801.28s: style is
2802.08s: cash for you know the major indices that
2804.56s: settle to cash
2805.52s: same same um and then for
2808.64s: the kind of commodities backed products
2811.60s: stuff like that
2812.32s: it'll just settle to the futures
2813.92s: contract itself
2815.44s: and then whenever that contract is due
2817.28s: to expire right
2818.72s: um then whatever will happen on that
2821.12s: underlying contract
2822.88s: um yeah based on the contract itself
2825.04s: yeah you know somebody just said that to
2826.80s: me a couple of weeks ago they were like
2828.24s: why don't you do the
2830.16s: options and i just listen i love options
2833.12s: i do
2833.68s: i just have not ever look we'll have to
2836.72s: we'll have to chat offline about a
2838.32s: couple of those things because
2840.56s: um yeah i just want to yeah
2844.72s: yeah interesting yeah happy too i i
2846.56s: think that they're they're really cool
2848.08s: products
2848.72s: the the options on futures i'm
2850.08s: definitely a fan of them
2851.84s: um so with our last few minutes here
2855.60s: um there's two other questions i wanted
2857.60s: to ask you the first one
2859.04s: is what did you think about the past
2862.16s: year
2866.24s: um
2870.64s: it's certainly one for the record books
2873.12s: um
2874.40s: for me
2878.00s: i'm a sort of very pragmatic
2881.84s: i think to myself what can i do to
2885.60s: change
2886.08s: what's happening here in my personal
2888.16s: space right is there anything i can do
2891.44s: to affect or influence
2894.80s: anything big and it turns out no i
2898.16s: i i can't and so
2901.60s: i have this thought in my mind of you
2904.00s: know i really can't do anything
2906.08s: so i'm not gonna fret about it i'm just
2909.12s: gonna
2909.92s: i'm gonna chill somebody wants me to do
2912.56s: this
2913.04s: fine my thought is especially with
2916.48s: a family and that sort of thing my
2918.88s: thought is
2920.48s: can i keep the people around me
2925.36s: from spinning up because we're all sort
2928.64s: of
2931.36s: i don't know we're we're a family that's
2933.52s: very
2935.84s: and so i i have to go
2939.04s: wait let's can we just calm down
2942.40s: we can't we can you know like the
2945.92s: the theories especially my sons they are
2948.80s: just
2949.76s: i'm like wait a second we can't change
2953.44s: any of that so
2954.84s: just don't think about
2958.00s: packing a weapons bag and heading off to
2960.40s: outer montana or wherever
2963.12s: right and so that that really has been
2966.80s: my goal for the year am i concerned
2970.56s: about
2971.04s: what i perceive happening
2975.44s: yes sure and so
2979.44s: i try to be as liquid as i can be
2983.52s: and fluid as i can be and
2986.80s: just not to be mentally locked in a box
2990.56s: so again i think trading has done that
2993.28s: for me
2994.08s: it's allowed me to go hey don't spin up
2997.60s: what are you seeing what can you
3001.20s: influence here where is your direct
3006.96s: sphere and what do you need to do in
3009.44s: your space
3010.40s: and the rest of it i'm like you know
3013.84s: you're just gonna see people go
3016.54s: [Music]
3018.08s: guano crazy yeah they really are
3022.88s: and you just have to you know you gotta
3025.92s: you gotta roll with it
3028.24s: just gotta watch yeah yeah exactly and
3031.04s: prepare
3032.24s: watch and prepare and not be
3036.48s: uh not be overly complacent and so
3040.00s: you know it's just like sitting in your
3041.76s: trade you know if you some if you go hey
3044.24s: you know what this thing's going to turn
3045.60s: around it's
3046.80s: and then every day goes lower and
3048.40s: learning like okay maybe i ought to
3050.56s: think about what i need to do with this
3052.24s: train
3053.28s: right so we really don't want things
3056.08s: like that to happen with us in
3057.76s: the real world so you know you just
3061.04s: uh prepare and and there there are days
3064.48s: coming that i think are going to be
3067.44s: probably darker than than
3070.88s: we would want to them to be but
3073.92s: you know the sun will rise again
3077.36s: and those of us that are uh
3081.44s: directed shall prevail yeah i think
3084.32s: that's fair i i think
3085.52s: uh it's how life goes
3088.80s: um the uh the last question i wanted to
3091.84s: ask you for
3092.88s: at least for me when i look back at the
3096.00s: past
3096.40s: year um kind of in general like you're
3099.68s: talking about i've just seen a bunch of
3101.12s: volatility
3101.92s: not like not even just from a trading
3103.44s: perspective just literally the world
3105.36s: yeah yeah um but then kind of
3109.44s: drawing that parallel to to trading
3111.84s: itself
3113.12s: this last year has been fascinating to
3116.24s: me
3116.56s: yeah because just about everything that
3118.48s: you know i base my decisions on and
3120.24s: whatnot
3121.20s: it's all different this year so
3125.04s: the the kind of last thing i wanted to
3127.44s: to ask you is just
3129.04s: what were maybe one or two things that
3131.28s: you saw throughout this year that were
3133.20s: just
3133.60s: extremely unique uh compared to what
3137.04s: you've seen in previous years
3140.48s: well i think the biggest thing is that
3144.80s: it's the stuff you know people are
3147.60s: talking about it now
3149.36s: but we started seeing it shift maybe
3151.52s: towards june
3152.56s: july how much the option
3157.20s: how much the option space is actually
3159.36s: driving the market
3160.96s: versus the market driving the option
3164.00s: space
3165.36s: that is the most remarkably different
3167.68s: thing that i've seen
3169.36s: um it's been a
3172.64s: a very tough year for me because i feel
3176.00s: like
3176.88s: there are no natural rhythms of ebb and
3180.24s: flow that have appeared in times past
3184.16s: right and so there's a lot that i've had
3186.40s: to change
3187.60s: um but you know adapt or die
3190.64s: right and so the big things
3195.04s: that i've seen the biggest thing is what
3198.24s: options are doing to drive the market
3201.36s: because the market maker
3203.12s: who is seeing the call options just
3205.68s: continually rise
3207.60s: in order for his delta not to be
3210.96s: savagely negative because he's got the
3213.20s: other side of that he's got to go buy
3214.80s: the stock
3216.16s: and so that is really
3220.08s: driving this motion you know every
3222.32s: person i talk to in
3223.68s: in the options pits are like i've never
3226.24s: seen anything like this
3227.36s: you know they're buying calls in
3230.64s: mass 200 out of the money
3234.24s: in you know something like
3237.28s: apple or tesla or whatever right it's
3240.00s: just
3241.40s: extraordinary motion and
3243.84s: here is the biggest thing
3246.96s: when moves get very fast
3250.40s: it's like blowing a bubble
3253.60s: very quickly it will
3257.12s: snap without
3260.56s: any notion that it's going to snap
3264.16s: right if you blow a bubble with the
3266.16s: bubble gum and you blow it
3267.84s: slowly you can see those edges and you
3271.60s: can go
3272.32s: all right this is we're getting there
3274.16s: yeah yeah
3275.36s: but it's moving so fast that when it
3277.68s: comes
3278.96s: i mean we're going to get up and it's
3280.40s: going to be limit down for days
3282.80s: right it's just a matter it's just a
3286.00s: matter of time the big thing i
3287.68s: just read before i got on this call with
3290.96s: you
3292.16s: is what's going on with uh
3295.44s: china and the loans and everybody's
3298.56s: reading about that yeah to restructure
3301.60s: all the loans and so the only thing that
3305.04s: makes a market crash is illiquidity
3308.24s: that's the only thing and so it's going
3311.52s: to come the reason they say
3313.68s: you know the credit guys are the
3315.04s: smartest guys in the room
3317.12s: is because they're seeing where people
3320.08s: are getting
3320.88s: in big trouble and they can hedge in
3322.64s: that space
3323.92s: and we're going to start having these
3325.52s: pockets of illiquidity and it doesn't
3327.20s: matter how much money they print
3330.16s: the more money they print the less
3334.80s: uh reliable the whole system becomes
3338.48s: and so you know
3341.60s: it's but these things sometimes can take
3344.48s: 15 years to unwind
3346.56s: so you know i mean the the 2006
3350.72s: 2007 crisis we had it it started in
3353.60s: 1985.
3356.08s: so who knows
3359.36s: yeah i've been maybe today maybe
3361.36s: tomorrow i've
3362.64s: i've been blown away just the the
3365.04s: overall
3366.00s: move of the move in the market this year
3367.68s: and kind of like you
3369.12s: in a very similar way i've been very
3371.60s: very mindful of how much risk
3373.60s: i need to put out and realistically most
3376.32s: months
3377.20s: um i would put out the the minimum i
3380.16s: needed
3380.72s: you know just kind of my annual goal
3384.16s: yeah i'm the same way just
3387.60s: very small exposure to the market
3389.44s: because you know i'm
3391.84s: old and so i don't i don't i mean
3394.72s: although i want to trade until i die
3397.04s: i don't want to have to trade until i
3399.36s: die right
3400.16s: right and so how i make money now is
3402.80s: just that
3403.52s: slow and easy space and say you know
3407.44s: i would love to pack myself on the back
3410.16s: and get a great big home run someplace
3413.68s: but it's just it's just not wise right
3416.40s: now
3416.80s: it it's not wise like you're talking
3419.28s: about with your backgrounds
3420.08s: probabilities and
3421.12s: statistics it's just not yeah it's only
3423.04s: about not great right now
3424.72s: yeah yeah this was such an enjoyable
3428.16s: conversation oh this is
3429.52s: so glad i got to talk to you i
3432.56s: i look forward to keeping in touch some
3434.32s: more yeah that would be
3435.92s: absolutely great and then um if there's
3439.20s: anything that you want to share with the
3440.88s: group if if you have any
3442.40s: um like instagram handles or twitter
3444.96s: whatever you like to use
3446.16s: just i'll throw it all in the
3448.08s: description but you know i i'd love to
3450.56s: just essentially expose folks to your
3452.96s: approach and whatnot well i thank you
3454.56s: very much
3455.20s: i think it'll be it'll be great and i'll
3458.00s: make sure to
3459.44s: share the link when this um gets through
3462.40s: and
3462.72s: and have some folks get to hear from you
3464.88s: guys i think the
3466.32s: i love the military community that
3469.44s: uh you have there because you know it's
3471.68s: uh
3472.80s: it's important right um it's important
3476.32s: that
3476.64s: they get the chance and um
3480.48s: you know i trade with a couple of my
3483.52s: kids
3484.40s: i've taught a couple of them to trade
3487.04s: and
3488.96s: i just think it's exciting to be able to
3490.88s: share that information
3492.24s: and have people learn from each other in
3495.68s: important ways
3497.12s: it is yeah and the the thing that gets
3499.44s: me with the military folks in general is
3501.28s: a lot of them
3502.08s: just don't have the natural exposure
3504.00s: right there's not a lot of
3505.12s: traders especially in derivatives but at
3507.60s: the end of the day what i do find is the
3509.36s: folks that i do come across
3511.60s: most of them are pretty damn good at it
3513.44s: once they get going they want to learn
3515.44s: and then they have discipline when
3516.64s: they're
3516.96s: that's it that is it yeah it's
3520.48s: discipline is all it is absolutely
3524.24s: the anchor to the work yep i absolutely
