0.00s: What's up, outliers?
1.64s: Markets closed.
2.32s: So time for an op X market update.
6.12s: So today I got two things on the agenda.
8.32s: Good old game stop and then we're going to take a look at Chewie.
11.28s: And then for those that are interested later today at 5 p.m. Pacific time, we have our
16.16s: options trading for beginners live stream.
18.86s: So today's kind of an open ended day will cover whatever topics you all want to spend
24.00s: a little time diving deeper into.
26.00s: But these recessions built around and for beginners.
29.12s: So this is where you can come ask all of those beginner questions that you might not
32.72s: feel comfortable sharing them somewhere else or you're just struggling to pick up.
36.08s: That's what it's for.
37.08s: So let's get right in today.
38.84s: I actually did not love the price action in game stop.
42.56s: And the reason why I didn't love the price action is because game stop was kind of a
47.68s: little bit down today.
48.84s: If I zoom this in a little bit, you can see that we opened at 2225 and then we closed
54.20s: at 2221.
55.92s: So essentially a flat day, but I don't like that it's slightly negative.
62.24s: There's a few reasons for this primarily because the larger burden of where we think interest
69.48s: rates are going and what small caps are doing was actually slightly lifted today.
74.84s: And this is what I'm referring to right here.
77.48s: I WM had a pretty big day today.
79.12s: It was over 3%.
80.36s: And this comes back from Big Daddy J pal hanging out with the boys at Jackson Hole and they're
88.20s: just out there talking their shit.
90.16s: Obviously I'm joking, but they're talking about inflation and they're starting to signal
95.32s: that they think it's about time.
97.44s: And the reason why I don't appreciate the way GME behaves today from a price perspective.
104.68s: I was hoping for more of a pop is what I'm getting at is we can take a look at this.
109.24s: This is the number of companies in the New York stock stock exchange.
112.52s: So a lot of smaller made cap stocks that have made highs today.
117.12s: So when I look at this yesterday net highs lows was 136 companies today.
124.08s: It was 287 a massive change.
127.44s: Now the other thing is gross highs lows, meaning just a raw number, not net yesterday.
134.40s: Gross highs was 153 in today.
137.04s: It's 293 almost double.
139.40s: So a lot of small cap stocks saw a breath of fresh air today.
144.52s: And you can see that bit across this whole thing.
147.84s: So really what this highlights is that the argument of the broader indices are slowing
153.64s: down and not helping is actually kind of abated here.
158.48s: Which to some degree, that's not bad because it means that we don't necessarily have an
162.36s: additional headwind.
164.36s: But I really, really was hopeful that we might see a little bit of life come in today.
169.00s: And we just didn't really see this pop through.
173.00s: So volume today again for kind of two days running was overwhelming sale volume and
179.40s: very light four million shares traded with.
185.12s: I mean, we're below the 20 day average.
188.56s: We're slightly above the five day average, which is nice just to see a little bit of volume
193.84s: picking up on a relative basis, but it's still pretty contracted unfortunately.
199.40s: So again, it goes back to this thing until we start to see volume picking up to some
203.60s: degree.
205.00s: This is more or less what I expect to see is kind of this sideways trending action.
210.80s: And my expectation would be as soon as we start seeing some volume flow into this, we'll
216.04s: start to see some price movement.
217.40s: Now the other positive I do want to highlight here, although I don't love that we're starting
221.80s: to rotate over ever so slightly is that we have been range bound.
227.36s: Essentially from the ninth, we've been trading almost straight sideways.
231.28s: So one of the benefits to that looking on the bright side of things again is that even
235.64s: though there's decent sale volume, it's not strong enough to really start pushing price
240.00s: down, which is also awesome to see.
243.20s: So a bit of a mixed bag, I suppose.
245.88s: I just really wanted to see with the broader market lifting today, some of that flow
250.02s: over into this, but I mean, that's just how it goes sometimes.
253.40s: So let's take a look at the option stream.
255.96s: And today we had a decent amount of a wide bleed off.
259.80s: So there's 574,000 calls.
262.96s: And after today, 100,000 of those are gone.
265.88s: So we are again, in this quieter period with respect to just where we're seeing options
272.56s: activity.
273.56s: You're always keeping an eye on it as I said I would, but there's just not a whole lot
278.28s: to keep an eye on it.
279.28s: It's relatively slow and steady in here.
281.96s: The other thing I will note yet again is take a look at this six step.
285.44s: I took my volatility trade down today because I started thinking I got the move I was going
290.72s: to get and sure enough, vol dropped from over 80% for this expiration cycle down to 72.
298.96s: So there's a little bit of a move there, but I took it down before this move because
302.92s: otherwise, I mean, I would just start losing money on this trade at this point, the, the
307.44s: vol trade.
308.44s: I still expect that 72% to go up for sure, but it's just taken its sweet time.
315.48s: Now the other thing I did want to see is based on the volume today, very light.
320.44s: And it looks like most of it is moving out into the next expiration cycle.
324.24s: So kind of standard general behavior here for a game stop playing mostly on the front,
331.00s: the front options.
332.00s: And again, reminder, we have earnings coming up on the fourth schedule right now for
337.12s: before the open.
338.64s: The other thing I did was take a look for the whole week.
343.20s: And I wanted to see in game stop first.
345.56s: Then we'll look at you.
347.20s: But looking through game stop focusing on the calls and just seeing what kind of size
351.76s: as we saw.
352.76s: We only had two lines, two trades, composite trades, this top one above $100,000.
359.76s: This one's large to be clear.
361.76s: The 20 June 25s, those were $364,000 trade, that's not insignificant.
370.28s: But I mean, the other trade was for 16 Jan 26, that was 175.
374.72s: So like all these bigger trades are pretty far out in time.
377.80s: And those are the only two.
379.36s: So just again, another example of a pretty quiet week with respect to the options chain.
385.88s: All right.
387.04s: Quick peek at Chewie because the interesting thing in here is that we've started running
390.60s: sideways here as well.
392.64s: So back from a quick break grab of drink of water.
396.04s: Actually, it's a little bit of a pedea light getting a hydration on.
401.20s: So in Chewie, they've also been really trending sideways.
405.40s: I think I already told you guys I had some long calls that I exited out here.
410.08s: And it's just because it just wasn't moving, right?
412.84s: So in here, it was rallying pretty hard.
416.36s: And then my guess is that it's quite likely to consolidate into earnings, which it has
422.12s: on the 28th.
424.24s: So the difference, though, is when I look at Chewie, is Chewie options have actually been
429.84s: really busy on a relative basis.
433.96s: And when I say busy, I'm specifically hiding and look at all these different explorations
439.00s: that are in here.
440.00s: Whereas when we typically look at GameStop, it's very siloed to front exploration, second
446.48s: exploration as the front exploration is expiring.
449.24s: And you know, that whole bit here, it continues to be all over the place.
455.20s: But there's definitely a position in going on for earnings, which again, is on the 28th,
459.96s: which will be captured here.
460.96s: And you can see that there's double calls to puts.
464.28s: So still relatively small, 32k to 15k, but nonetheless bullish positioning as far as I
469.16s: can see, or earnings coming up.
471.52s: And we can see earnings, all nice and high as per usual.
474.96s: So 128% vol, which promptly drops down to 96%, which again, is what I expect to see for
481.04s: earnings, unlike what we're seeing in GameStop.
483.60s: Now, obviously, before we get too far, we actually, if you go back to GameStop, because
488.80s: you all know it needs to happen, we got a poor one out for the homies because there
493.40s: is just a bunch of people, again, that have options that just expired completely worthless.
500.40s: We can see, for example, of this 11,000, there was 1700 added over yesterday in only 7600
508.60s: traded today.
509.68s: So some, I'm guessing the majority of the 7600 would be people trying to grab whatever
514.04s: value they can, but that leads several thousand that just expired worthless.
518.12s: So shout out to the homies.
522.36s: That's how she goes sometimes.
523.68s: Now again, I continue to reiterate this point.
527.06s: If you buy calls or if you buy options, I have a video, I will link to it as I always do,
533.32s: on a way to do this a little bit better, a little smarter so that we're not just lighting
536.92s: money on fire on a weekly basis.
539.60s: It does not have to be like that.
542.00s: So I'll throw that in the notes below in case you want to check that out.
545.80s: And in case you just want to stay playing the fronts and seeing what happens, that's
549.24s: cool too, whatever floats your boat.
551.60s: Now the last thing I'll say about chewy is when I look at chewy options activity for
557.24s: this past week, I get a different view.
561.24s: And it's, I mean, take a look at this.
563.88s: This is for this entire week call side on the ask side.
568.40s: And this is literally all that populates, right?
570.64s: And we're already down here to $207.
573.60s: So much smaller aggregate size and total trading here.
578.00s: This chain in chewy is also relatively quiet at this time.
584.20s: So that is the expiration week for here again, coverage as promised, but not a whole lot
590.88s: to report at this time.
592.60s: Now tomorrow we have our game stop YouTube livestream at 5pm Pacific time.
596.72s: This will be another solo one.
598.04s: I'm chatting with Newton to see if we can find a time that fits with his schedule a little
601.52s: bit better in the coming weeks to get us back together for some of those kind of fun
605.72s: joint sessions.
606.72s: But really at this point, I'm still spending a lot of time digging into the background.
611.76s: So that's the goal for tomorrow.
612.76s: If there's anything you think I should take a look at, let me know.
615.08s: I would love to.
616.68s: Until next time, be an outlier.
617.68s: I'll see you guys later.
