2.28s: what's up everyone welcome back to the
4.16s: all podcast I have a familiar face my
6.60s: friend Matt kuso from cruso insights
9.44s: which is a fantastic Name by the way I
11.08s: use a similar name for my newsletter
12.84s: great minds think alike good to see you
14.52s: my friend how are you I'm good thanks
16.56s: for having me back Eric appreciate it an
18.44s: absolute BL so we were just talking
20.00s: about how um there's so much money
22.92s: flowing out of your pockets that you
25.00s: just can't get into the small stocks
27.28s: anymore as much as you'd like to
29.48s: obviously say that in uh in J for people
32.28s: but it reminds me did you see that
34.24s: comment that Warren Buffett made pretty
35.84s: recently about some of the stuff that
37.76s: he's trying to do with his money one of
39.44s: the it was I think at the shareholders
41.00s: meeting and they were saying like um you
43.16s: know why do you have so much money in
45.28s: cash because it's a few billion dollars
47.00s: and his response was perfect his
49.04s: response was I don't think anybody knows
51.24s: what to do with a billion dollars
54.00s: so you know it's interesting he also had
56.40s: another interesting comment because I I
58.12s: didn't watch the whole thing by the kind
59.64s: of like highlight real I guess you know
61.72s: and uh someone asked him if if you were
63.60s: younger or if you had less Capital what
65.44s: would you do and it kind of goes back to
66.68s: what you and I were talking about like
68.60s: like the highest like consistent returns
70.60s: is that you know you're limited by scale
72.36s: at a certain point but he was saying
73.56s: he's like he he he's confident that he
75.28s: could go around and find like a lot of
77.28s: goods like small but like you know these
79.84s: 30 40 50% per year return but they're
82.52s: they're small like you you can't scale
84.56s: in like I would even say in the tens of
85.92s: millions or billions if definitely not
87.40s: billions but you know things are out
89.20s: there if if you hustle you know but uh
91.52s: when you got a few billion it's a
92.76s: different you know people like to kind
94.56s: of chastise the the the big hedge fund
96.52s: guys or what but when you're trading you
98.48s: know few thousand few hundred thousand a
100.80s: few million and you're trading five
102.60s: billion it's a it's a different B yeah
105.36s: it's one of those things that I feel
106.64s: like Traders don't really think I know I
109.68s: didn't I didn't think enough of and
110.96s: again like we were right before we were
112.24s: talking we were talking a little bit
113.40s: about scale and it's not like I'm I'm
115.60s: trading at this massive scale even
117.24s: shadow of what those guys are and I
119.28s: still into liqu especially in the
121.32s: options markets I mean that is that
124.52s: that's one of the the really tricky
125.92s: Parts actually about derivatives is a
128.12s: lot of people to talk about oh like you
130.76s: know what should I trade what should I
132.00s: look at and it's just like once you're
134.00s: kind of at scale there's only a workable
136.84s: Universe available to you it's it's it
139.00s: really is quite naturally limiting by
141.56s: itself now I imagine for your
145.12s: progression from kind of the really
147.44s: small stocks into other things that fit
149.16s: the portfolio better that there are
151.56s: probably more suitable Alternatives or
153.68s: is that overselling it you
155.68s: think what do you mean by that D we
158.04s: could rephrase that when you go from
159.80s: your kind of small group of you know
162.20s: smaller stocks and you start looking at
164.04s: like the next level of market cap that
165.68s: fits the portfolio is there a lot to
167.48s: pick from or is it this starts scoping
170.08s: down really fast I I think um if you're
173.68s: like an individual investor there's
174.88s: still like a large amount of scope uh I
178.40s: think once you start kind of getting
179.36s: into like the hedge funds like situation
181.12s: it changes liquidity becomes I mean I
182.88s: think that's why like look look you know
184.12s: Nvidia like in all these AI megas that
186.64s: have been running so hot like this
187.96s: disparity between those and everything
189.64s: else like I think they're getting like
191.40s: multiple Tailwind like one is obviously
193.28s: the whole AI theme and what that could
194.96s: do but I think the liquidity part is is
198.24s: pulling them in I mean if you're a hedge
199.56s: fund guy or whatever anyone big fund and
201.68s: you want to have like exposure to the
203.60s: space I mean Nvidia is like you don't
205.64s: get more liquid than that so you know
207.16s: they also get like the liquidity premium
208.68s: and all that so definitely
210.32s: definitely helps but if you're if you're
211.48s: a smaller investor there still like a
213.24s: wide space that you could play with for
215.28s: sure yeah I imagine and talk to me about
218.32s: that so far I think we connected like
220.56s: first quarter of this year I tried to do
222.08s: like quarterly with is like people like
225.00s: you that I like and just see like how
228.24s: the year is playing out and I think if I
229.68s: recall correctly you know towards the
231.36s: beginning of the year it was a little
233.32s: bit of kind of back and forth like
234.76s: trying to find good opportunities how's
237.04s: that played out since last we spoke so
240.16s: ended up getting position a lot of good
242.12s: names had some really great action
245.08s: actually it's funny we were talking last
246.60s: call about using options to hedge for a
248.36s: lot of these things which I was using
250.00s: and kind of in a good way because
252.44s: earning season was not kind I think I I
254.32s: counted just recently like nine out of
255.84s: about 11 stocks like gap down on
257.72s: earnings for me so you know I know it's
260.48s: people say bad luck but I I hate luck I
263.28s: feel like if you think bad luck you
264.32s: start to you start to invite it into
265.84s: your life it's really just you know the
267.44s: probability curve it's just on the I'm
268.84s: on the wrong side of the uh the bell
270.56s: curve this but you know what like
273.16s: thankfully I mean jokes aside the
275.08s: earnings Hedges made it like okay it was
276.96s: I mean it's not the you know it was
278.40s: frustrating because like the way I like
280.72s: to kind of build exposure build
282.20s: positions it takes some time to to do
284.12s: that together so if you get kind of
285.24s: knocked out of a lot of positions in in
287.00s: earning season and then markets were
288.36s: still strong it's a little more
289.72s: difficult to like immediately reposition
291.96s: so it was kind of unfortunate that they
293.68s: didn't kind of like Gap and run our way
295.24s: which would have been fantastic but then
296.56s: also kind of forcing the repositioning
298.88s: so it's been a tricky but you know um
301.60s: it's one of the main tools I rely on is
303.68s: like the net highs net lows to tell me
305.40s: like what kind of environment we're in I
307.08s: use all it's been super helpful because
309.72s: like there's been a lot of I mean just
311.08s: recently we had this leg up in AI like
312.76s: that kind of propelled everything but
314.20s: besides that if you're a trend follower
316.12s: which is where I I fall like the past
318.44s: two three months have been like deadly
320.00s: chop so like thank thankfully like I was
321.72s: able to kind of s side step all that
323.12s: chop and all that kind of uh frustration
325.16s: so you know can't complain too much when
326.76s: when I hit the the opposite side of the
328.20s: uh the bell curve of earning reports
330.20s: it'll be a a different
332.00s: conversation have you one of the things
334.16s: I noticed because that's actually one of
336.28s: the the early connecting points I think
337.92s: between you and I is net highs lows I
339.64s: haven't found like a ton of people that
341.04s: used it and it's something I've always
342.80s: used that like accumulation distribution
345.68s: tick and Trend like those kinds of
346.92s: things I've always liked those for
348.20s: breath indicators and one of the things
350.48s: I noticed really interesting for net
352.00s: highs lows was the disparity between
354.36s: NASDAQ and the NY the New York Stock
356.72s: Exchange what do you make of that so you
360.04s: know it's a I think it's a really
361.68s: versatile tool that I think people maybe
363.52s: like sometimes misinterpret or they
364.88s: don't get all everything they can out of
366.20s: it I think right some people kind of
367.60s: Clump it all together to get a reading I
369.56s: like having them separate because the
372.20s: the NASDAQ and NY stocks they they
373.92s: really kind of um reflect like the
376.44s: different types of Trends in the market
377.72s: like the more speculative versus the
379.00s: more mature that's the way I like to
380.36s: look at it and so you can see like
382.08s: lately it's been very weak on the NASDAQ
384.20s: side of things because really apart from
386.08s: the the large caps everything else has
387.76s: been pretty weak but you know even
390.16s: rather than kind of think of it like as
391.68s: a bull market bare Market indicator for
393.48s: me it's kind of it's almost more of like
395.20s: an easy money hard money indicator
397.24s: because that's really what I think
398.52s: because I mean you know it's not
399.64s: nothing's perfect sometimes you know you
400.92s: can have a few net lows and we kind of
402.28s: turn around we bounce the other way or
403.84s: there's net highs and we roll over but
405.64s: like the way I look at is just like if
407.00s: you look at any environment if you have
408.76s: net highs it's probably like a much
410.52s: easier money environment because because
412.92s: what it's really measuring is is
414.20s: measuring like net liquidity flows you
416.00s: know if more stocks are making 52 we
417.76s: highs and lows like you have net money
419.72s: coming into the market if it's the
421.08s: opposite like I mean now just recently
423.56s: if you've been in a few large caps I
425.08s: mean it's great you're not complaining
426.80s: but um most other stocks have really
428.80s: been struggling so I think a lot of
430.36s: people will look at advaned decline I
432.64s: mean and all these kind of things and
434.00s: just like take a hard stance of like I
436.16s: need to be a bear or I need to be a bull
438.36s: that's dangerous man because because if
439.68s: you look at for example the advanced
440.92s: decline line another like breath
442.96s: indicator people like uh like that
445.20s: topped in 1998 and the market topped in
447.96s: 2000 so if you were like screaming at
450.00s: the screen saying like uh you know we
451.60s: have more decliners in advanceable I
452.88s: mean you missed the whole dot rally like
454.56s: who wants to Miss DOT you know so uh
457.08s: like what I also like and that's kind of
458.88s: what I like about net highs lows too a
460.32s: little more than like just a pure
461.60s: Divergence like a advanced decline is
464.36s: you know Advanced decline like that
465.72s: Divergence can can stay active for a
467.68s: long time while the trend persists like
469.80s: now we've had a bit of a disparity
471.48s: between net highs and net lows in the
473.92s: market but usually that disparity is
476.08s: very short lived because if it is a
477.72s: healthy Market you'll get a few more
479.00s: stocks new hides it'll turn the corner
481.08s: much much quicker so I find it's a more
483.08s: versatile tool but you have to put in
485.04s: context instead of it being like this I
487.12s: think it's like we're all trained from
488.16s: sports like we all have like our home
489.44s: team that we like you know either I'm a
491.00s: bull or I'm a bear and like people like
492.68s: really identify as that when when that's
495.00s: their their view point like I think just
496.44s: be more flexible I think it's like easy
498.08s: dollar environment or hard dollar
499.28s: environment so how do you want to play I
501.52s: think the the part also that I would
503.48s: tack on to that is I find the longer I'm
505.80s: in markets the more I find people really
507.64s: are just interested in simple
510.12s: explanations what's the one thing I can
512.24s: look at that gives me all the
513.24s: information right and kind of to your
515.28s: point that that one thing isn't it's not
517.20s: there stock price maybe right up down
519.64s: that's that's one thing but yeah I I
522.64s: feel like whenever I talk to people
524.36s: about those kinds of things I find that
526.80s: same lack of nuance and to me that's
529.08s: actually where a lot of the
530.04s: opportunities kind of emerge because
533.36s: especially for me the way I will use any
536.84s: sort of breath indicator net highs lows
538.72s: whatever it is
540.16s: it's not like a binary choice for me
542.88s: it's positive or negative I'm long I'm
544.88s: short exactly as you're outlining it's
547.24s: more of kind of an informative tool
549.36s: against the rest of what you see because
552.00s: you can still find plenty of periods
553.96s: I've run a massive study that overlays
557.40s: net highs lows with the price of all the
560.36s: different indices and sectors just to
562.52s: see how well they line up and like any
565.68s: sort of oscillator is indicator there's
568.60s: a lot of noise in it
569.88s: and understanding how to interpret those
572.40s: periods of noise becomes really
574.80s: important and I always think like
577.12s: overlaying it with what you're seeing on
579.72s: the actual charts and the rest of the
581.36s: market tends to be a pretty good
583.72s: exercise when you're thinking about
587.08s: analyzing let's say right now for
589.44s: example the NASDAQ the net lows not
594.52s: super crazy low but definitely trending
597.16s: below zero for a little while now what
601.20s: do you look for in that data especially
604.16s: against when you look at something like
605.84s: the S&P 500 which just made essentially
608.56s: new highs again how do you kind of layer
611.12s: those two so you always want to find
612.96s: like what's what's the trend of this
614.44s: cycle so like to me it's an important
618.36s: data point because it just kind of like
620.36s: it cuts through the noise a 52 we higher
622.96s: low is an important event it's not like
624.40s: Advanced decline like you know any stock
626.08s: could be up a nickel today or down a
627.68s: nickel and that counts like an up or
628.92s: down so I mean like generally more
630.72s: stocks are breaking down but this in
632.40s: this cycle is just it's kind of odd
634.16s: where it just so happens that the stocks
636.16s: that are like exploding happen to be the
638.08s: largest market cap stocks in the world
639.68s: at the same time so anyone kind of
641.76s: stepping back if you're just forcing
643.24s: trades so if you look at this you know
645.12s: blindly but the Market's up so I need to
646.68s: be long but you're forcing trades in all
648.40s: the wrong groups uh you're getting run
651.08s: over the chop is is immense if you're
653.28s: trying to buy breakouts and anything
654.68s: that hasn't been working so for me it's
655.96s: just kind of like okay we're in this
657.16s: hard dollar environment at least the
659.40s: figure out where the money's flowing and
660.72s: once you see that then you can kind of
661.76s: piece together the story it's not always
663.28s: easy at the beginning of a trend but I
665.24s: think it's been pretty clear for like a
666.52s: few weeks if you're if you were throwing
667.88s: money at anything except AI large cap
670.52s: Tech I mean you're not getting anywhere
671.88s: I mean in fact if you look at a lot of
673.08s: industrial stocks and the rest I mean
674.40s: they've they've been like already in
675.84s: some you know decent sized Corrections
678.36s: so uh for me it's just it's really just
680.48s: about understanding what's really going
682.44s: on in the market because the indexes
684.92s: they're not as descriptive as they used
686.52s: to the concentration is too high like
688.44s: it's it's weird I never thought I would
690.32s: say this but like the Dow 30 the DOW
692.48s: Industrials 30 because it's like a price
694.60s: weighted index probably gives like a
697.28s: better like um Diversified look at
699.80s: stocks than like the NASDAQ or S&P I was
701.72s: actually I was having this discussion
702.92s: with a friend of mine recently if you're
704.72s: like trying to bring a new fund to
706.76s: Market and and you want to you know sell
709.00s: it to retail and you tell like the the
711.28s: product officer like hey but you know
712.64s: what like I have like three stocks or
714.52s: 30% he's gonna say like you're too
715.92s: concentrated we can't you know we can't
717.20s: offer that to retail but then after like
719.52s: the stock market itself has like
721.12s: basically you know three stocks being 25
723.88s: 26% of the total index so the
726.56s: concentration is off the the charts I
728.32s: mean how far how long it lasts hard to
730.32s: know I mean it's interesting because
731.92s: because then after always the I know I'm
734.00s: kind of going off topic but people
735.24s: always kind of say like oh maybe this
736.32s: time is different maybe like the large
737.88s: companies will like dominate unlike
740.12s: before you know it's always the young
741.92s: upstar that ultimately kind of up I mean
743.88s: if you kind of look even at this current
745.00s: cycle how was this all kicked off it was
746.72s: all kicked off with open AI I mean they
748.84s: kind of like it's just that you know
749.80s: then all all these other stocks are
751.04s: benefiting from the infrastructure play
752.64s: but it was like this new upstart who
754.12s: kind of shook up what AI in turned it
757.32s: into like a genitor of AI we can all use
759.12s: so I mean I know they're the largest
760.84s: group in the world they'll probably keep
762.56s: keep doing well and growing because they
763.92s: have such long inroads but I still I
767.68s: still look to see who the next big
769.28s: players are going to be to kind of shake
770.32s: things that's where the really monster
771.68s: percentage Gaines will
773.24s: be especially from your perspective of
776.64s: stock trading I mean like trying to make
778.72s: sure that
780.16s: yeah that's it's actually funny
782.80s: listening to that because it reminds me
784.28s: that I kind of probably play the game a
786.44s: little bit on an easier mode just in
789.32s: that one single sense options are by no
792.00s: means easier to be clear for most people
793.92s: they add a tremendous amount of
795.24s: complexity but the one good part is you
798.68s: can create leverage out of thin air
800.44s: essentially just kind of there but so
804.00s: when you're kind of looking through
805.68s: trying to find these different leaders
810.56s: now what's that looking like for you
813.24s: where are they there's only one place
816.00s: it's all it's been the ai ai large c not
818.96s: that everything else is broken I mean
820.36s: like there's still like you can look
821.28s: around a lot of stocks that are healthy
822.56s: they're basing but they haven't had any
825.52s: momentum like moves for months like
827.44s: they've just been stuck sideways with
829.08s: General markets it's been I mean I mean
831.32s: there's there's someone I follow Jason
832.64s: goer he's from uh sentiment Trader I
834.56s: don't know if you if you know the um the
837.20s: the company but they do great kind of
838.60s: like Technic research work and all the
840.24s: rest and he had some great tweets
842.56s: because know people will like anyone who
844.76s: says like you know oh this Market is is
846.20s: a bit narrow people like oh you're just
847.56s: angry because you're not invested super
849.04s: long but like statistically I mean like
851.32s: there's no other Market on record that's
852.76s: had such a disparity between the few and
854.68s: the many you know so so looking for next
857.00s: leaders I mean clearly like the AI space
858.92s: has been hot we had big reversals today
860.64s: which look like maybe at least a short
862.28s: term I mean momentum can carry it higher
864.24s: anyways but typically it could be
865.80s: possibly a short-term top um but besides
868.72s: that there's other still healthy looking
870.32s: things but you need you need them to
871.96s: come out of their bases and show that
873.40s: momentum ignition again or else they can
875.04s: just kind of chop sideways for we're in
877.08s: summer now they can shop sideways for a
879.04s: couple of months
880.68s: easily yeah the next question I have
884.28s: then is when you try to think about the
888.36s: impact of the new regime on the
892.64s: capability for these different kinds of
894.20s: companies to grow do you think that
896.76s: we're at like the early stages of where
898.80s: you might start catching parabolic
900.44s: growth do you think that this is kind of
902.96s: where most of these smaller companies
905.00s: might be trying to get all their stuff
906.52s: together and then this is the kind of
908.00s: thing where like in a year from now is
909.96s: where you would actually start to see
911.24s: them taking off how do you think about
912.80s: that timeline for them yeah you know and
914.92s: this is I think it's a mistake on my
916.76s: part that I wasn't a little I wasn't
918.92s: much more focused on the large cap
920.56s: themes because I I kind of saw the AI
922.12s: come and said okay inv is going to be
923.44s: the the chip player who else is going to
924.72s: win but I think the perfect Playbook to
927.40s: answer your question is really the 90s
929.00s: in the internet you know so the first
931.48s: wave really was if you think about it
933.88s: was infrastructure even things like
935.56s: Microsoft like Windows like Windows is
937.36s: not really a product it's just it's just
938.84s: like the interface you use to access the
940.68s: other products like no one's no one's
942.24s: using Windows they're using stuff on
943.88s: Windows or you know compact came out
946.00s: with the laptop uh you know the you know
947.96s: portable computer and all the rest so I
950.12s: think we're really in that
951.00s: infrastructure wave which which it can
953.84s: be a good wave I mean as we can see but
956.00s: they really but the infrastructure Stu
959.20s: although they can have good sizable
960.84s: moves they kind of get weighed down by
962.60s: the fact that they're already large
963.72s: companies in terms of percentage return
965.44s: so if you look at the the the whole 90s
967.96s: uh bull market for internet the wildest
970.88s: and craziest percentage movers things
973.08s: like Yahoo and all the rest I mean those
975.48s: were those those weren't the
977.08s: infrastructure place they were the uh
979.52s: the people who were able to deliver the
981.24s: new experience to people so I think
983.80s: there's there's you know a whole new
985.12s: wave a good friend of mine was tell me
986.60s: recently he was looking at why
987.60s: combinator who's a oh sorry I just hit
991.12s: my my moving desk here sorry good you
993.84s: just you just got a little bit taller
995.76s: yeah that's it that's it so uh a good
997.56s: friend of mine was telling me Y
998.80s: combinator which they they help incubate
1000.80s: all these new startups I think like 95%
1002.68s: of the the new startups in the past year
1004.24s: are AI related so I mean just think of
1006.96s: the am the amount of ways that there's
1010.04s: going to be new implementation of this
1011.76s: technology and new outcomes even things
1014.00s: like biotech you can find diseases
1015.76s: better develop drugs better faster you
1017.84s: can look at machinery be more there's be
1019.88s: so many outputs and I think it's these
1021.92s: new Young companies they're going to
1023.68s: have the like eyew watering moves like
1026.44s: stuff we' haven't seen in a generation
1028.56s: so I'm still I'm still very excited I
1030.64s: think it's early days and I think it's
1032.16s: really is the real deal it's not a
1034.36s: buzzword I mean an AI I think we don't
1036.48s: see all of the output today but like
1038.56s: when people say well how do you know
1039.56s: it's real I look at just the amount of
1041.52s: capital that people are investing in the
1043.36s: space I mean like you're talking like I
1044.96s: mean I think uh Elon was talking about
1046.96s: how they're spending four or five
1048.00s: billion a year with inv just in chips
1050.00s: then there's the racks and all the rest
1051.40s: like that's just one company so like
1054.36s: combined companies are spending tens of
1056.08s: if not hundreds of billions of dollars
1057.96s: like you don't spend hundred billion
1059.20s: dollars unless you have a real path to
1061.28s: how you're going to be able to monetize
1062.60s: this stuff you know so like if it was
1064.56s: just hype I think before they invested
1066.48s: hundred billion dollars collectively
1068.16s: plus they would they would make sure
1070.12s: there's a real path to kind of use case
1072.60s: for all this stuff so I think it's a
1073.96s: real Revolution it's going to bring on a
1076.04s: whole bunch of interesting uh things and
1077.92s: and the companies are going to come out
1078.88s: out I think you're going to be it's
1080.24s: going to be the opportunity of a
1081.20s: lifetime I think in the next five years
1083.88s: it's funny you say that I've kind of
1085.92s: echoed that in a couple different senses
1088.84s: I think one of the things that you
1091.16s: brought up though that M makes me
1092.64s: chuckle a little bit was the idea of you
1095.28s: know not necessarily investing that much
1098.40s: without a clear pipeline but then I
1100.96s: can't help but think of the metaverse
1102.88s: was people were going in droves into the
1106.20s: metaverse and I don't see that much is
1109.44s: as much anymore I'm actually curious
1111.00s: from your perspective is that anything
1113.00s: that you think of at
1116.04s: all well you know so the metaverse yeah
1118.60s: I mean I don't think it was at all like
1120.60s: as broad-based or the kind of capital
1122.32s: out definitely not definitely not and
1124.44s: also like that was it was kind of a bet
1127.04s: on a new way for people to to want to
1130.04s: like operate like I mean maybe it's my
1132.64s: age and I don't consider myself an old
1134.12s: person but like I I find it weird to
1136.52s: have to live in a digital world like I
1138.32s: actually find like having my phone on me
1140.20s: all the time is annoying I'm sure maybe
1142.08s: younger crowd will disagree but I think
1144.80s: to ai's strength is that it can just be
1148.36s: used in like a countless number of ways
1151.16s: it's it's not about like trying to
1152.64s: transform your physical space into a
1154.56s: digital and like you have to adapt this
1156.28s: new environment like AI can you know
1158.40s: like I said it can help someone find a
1159.92s: drug quicker it can help like uh operate
1162.08s: your your uh Vehicles more efficiently
1164.28s: there's like so many ways it could be
1166.04s: incorporated like I think we're just
1167.44s: scratching the surface so I think it's
1169.52s: just there's um it's it's a much broader
1172.08s: scope of applicability which is going to
1173.72s: make it easier to scale in all kinds of
1175.40s: countless ways I think that's probably
1177.48s: one of the most exciting things actually
1179.24s: for my opinion as well it's funny I was
1180.80s: doing a podcast with another buddy um
1183.56s: earlier this week about the impact of AI
1186.52s: and he has a little bit of a the null
1189.32s: opinion which I find interesting which
1191.12s: is more of the he thinks it might be a
1193.36s: little bit overdone oversold have
1196.52s: massive massive expect
1199.20s: it has to live up to in order to even
1201.72s: justify the current valuations that
1203.44s: we're seeing and I sit here and I look
1205.96s: at it uh not saying that you disagree
1208.12s: with either of those but it sounds like
1209.84s: as you're as I hear you talking about it
1212.08s: I fall way more in line with your
1213.48s: general thought process where I I I
1216.36s: truly view this as one of these once in
1219.44s: a-lifetime events it's almost like when
1221.12s: we saw the internet come out that was a
1223.00s: big deal and I don't view this all that
1226.92s: differently than that they're different
1228.40s: right you can't do a direct comparison
1230.80s: but if I think about the potential
1232.28s: impact on top of the current
1233.96s: infrastructure we have already I mean
1237.16s: man how far how far can this go so this
1239.96s: leads to the followon question for you
1242.52s: when you're thinking about playing this
1244.48s: kind of move with this much opportunity
1248.24s: and breadth we talked about a little bit
1251.08s: of the infrastructure side of things
1252.80s: that seems like a a near-term play that
1254.60s: could make sense what's the ne what's
1257.52s: the follow on for that Playbook then cuz
1259.36s: obviously we can kind of forecast the
1261.12s: way we think this might go where it
1262.56s: might have greater impact than others
1264.32s: and I imagine that would probably impact
1265.92s: your positioning decision so I think
1268.20s: it's going to come out in two ways the
1269.60s: indirect and the direct way and so like
1272.72s: the indirect way is going to be all the
1274.56s: companies where I mean like this we'll
1276.96s: talk about like the unfortunate side
1278.28s: things that people are scared of but
1279.48s: like you know for example um they were
1282.08s: showing how I forget who was showing it
1283.96s: but basically they had like two phones
1285.40s: one was like an AI like calling to order
1287.24s: food and like the other was like an AI
1289.16s: like receptionist who was like taking
1290.48s: the order and they're both having what
1291.84s: sounded like two realistic people
1293.48s: conversations so basically that yet yeah
1295.84s: the call centers you won't need all of
1298.24s: those people like that's a huge cost
1300.04s: saving so everyone's always scared for
1301.56s: jobs but I think that's a that's
1303.92s: misplaced like every technological
1305.76s: reolution new jobs are found better jobs
1307.72s: so I I think you know in the short term
1309.20s: maybe it's a bit of pain but overall
1310.92s: like it should sort itself out um but so
1313.68s: all the companies who figure out how to
1316.24s: leverage it you're going to see like a
1318.12s: big boost to the bottom line for a lot
1319.88s: of companies who get that right uh just
1322.08s: like like anyone who who you know figure
1323.96s: out how to leverage the internet and I
1325.44s: mean think about it people before like
1327.84s: like the way things were shipped the way
1329.28s: things were ordered I mean think of you
1330.72s: have to have receptionists to take
1331.92s: orders I mean like it's I mean if by
1334.00s: today's standard it's ridiculous that we
1335.36s: did everything so manual so those people
1337.40s: all get like the bottom line boost I
1339.08s: think and then the more direct ways and
1340.80s: people are going to come out just like
1341.84s: with completely either never thought of
1345.36s: before products and services which is an
1347.04s: option or even just something sometimes
1348.92s: having a more streamlined AI driven
1351.80s: software or product can upend like big
1355.20s: comp like you know a lot of times we
1356.32s: look at these big companies like like oh
1357.52s: they're Untouchable they're so big but
1359.56s: like try and get a new product or a new
1361.56s: process through a big company all the
1363.00s: Committees you have to go through then
1364.24s: there's the like the Legacy Investments
1366.16s: we just spent so much on this how can we
1368.12s: just like throw away this investment so
1369.76s: like we'll do it Part partially and then
1371.68s: you have these small upstar that just
1373.52s: like run ahead and take and eat their
1374.92s: lunch you know like the Netflix examples
1376.52s: like the the common one that that you
1378.04s: know block Busters could have seen what
1379.84s: was coming so I think so those who kind
1381.88s: of Leverage it directly and those like
1383.48s: indirectly within the current ecosystem
1386.20s: and I think there's a lot of ways a
1389.64s: different uh we we speak of the internet
1391.96s: but you could think of like you know
1393.32s: nuclear bomb like how that kind of
1394.76s: changed things there was the energy and
1396.12s: then the whole like you know Space Race
1398.00s: and uranium stocks and in the 60s there
1400.24s: was all the like um rocket booster
1402.52s: stocks and and Aviation that took off
1404.52s: that was like a big thing uh or you
1406.52s: could think of even the car how that
1407.96s: kind of re evolutionize everything for
1409.80s: domestic travel I remember it's funny if
1412.24s: you look at early reports I like to
1413.52s: study like Tech technological
1414.92s: revolutions like a lot of people like
1416.76s: you can see qus people be like oh a car
1418.56s: will never be as you know as as useful
1420.48s: as my horse my horse can go everywhere
1422.12s: like now you look back at that you're
1423.72s: say like what a what a narrow view I
1425.52s: mean like you know for him maybe in his
1426.76s: world where he saw like just like an
1428.20s: open Metal the horse is more more useful
1431.08s: but as a society like the car obviously
1433.12s: it's far far better or there was trains
1435.48s: before then trains how they changed
1437.20s: everything so every I think this is
1439.12s: another one of those Cycles where you
1441.64s: know strap yourself in it's going to be
1443.60s: interesting and all of those Cycles
1445.76s: didn't last a year they all lasted for a
1447.96s: decade or two like I mean big
1449.92s: transformation so it's I mean and we
1451.72s: look at the 90s as the internet
1453.24s: transformation but really can even
1455.16s: almost extended into 20 I mean Google
1456.96s: came out was 2004 you know so like it
1459.48s: wasn't all just as Internet dominated in
1461.96s: the 2000s but I mean meta with 2000s uh
1465.64s: Apple really kind of got super
1467.20s: Innovative in the 2000s even though they
1468.84s: were around before so I mean the 2000s
1471.16s: were really kind of the second act of
1473.72s: like what was the
1475.64s: 1990s it's funny that you segue into
1479.08s: that because I know that you study a lot
1481.84s: of the a lot of the just histories of
1483.80s: markets and kind of different reference
1486.44s: points so that was going to be my next
1489.20s: question for you actually which was
1491.84s: looking at AI what's the closest
1495.28s: historical comparison you can think of
1497.84s: for what we're seeing and what we can
1499.48s: see obviously you gave a overview of
1501.40s: what it potentially will look like in
1502.76s: total scope but do you have a reference
1504.64s: Benchmark that comes to mind for
1507.40s: it I I think the internet's the best the
1510.32s: best one because because what was
1511.92s: different about the internet like I I
1513.76s: mentioned cars and Char you know cars
1515.56s: were like they got better but the car
1519.04s: remained the car like I think the
1520.76s: internet's a good example of where the
1523.56s: internet provided this base layer for a
1526.00s: platform that that like uh uh you know
1529.32s: mutated in many unforeseen possible
1532.08s: directions so like that that's why I
1534.20s: think the internet's probably the best
1537.16s: uh kind of comparison that we have kind
1539.96s: of thing you know
1541.96s: um yeah and and the way it had that like
1544.48s: you had multiple it's interesting
1546.00s: because the internet you even had even
1547.00s: multiple layers of of um infrastructure
1549.88s: plays so like the early infrastructure
1551.56s: winners like in the 80s and early 90s
1553.60s: were different than let's say Nell like
1556.36s: at the end of the 90s who was like doing
1557.76s: the fast ethernet so then like you know
1559.56s: the technology moves so quick you need
1560.96s: like another infrastructure rebuild 10
1562.64s: years later so so it's going to be I
1565.24s: think that's the best probably study and
1567.40s: it's similar like how you know Yahoo was
1569.44s: the portal the initial portal like
1570.92s: Google was like the updated version of
1573.20s: like better search and then you know
1574.76s: like the iPhone was like the updated
1576.80s: version of like the web browser like
1578.16s: it's in your phone and there's the App
1579.36s: Store so you have these like
1580.56s: reinventions along the way so the only
1583.36s: thing is with AI and I think just
1585.16s: everything in general now everything
1586.32s: happens faster so like whereas stuff
1589.16s: happened like you know over let's say
1590.92s: call that 20 years from 90 to more
1593.80s: really like you know like uh Microsoft
1595.28s: came out mid 80s so call it let's say 20
1599.04s: 25 years like that cycle maybe this
1601.32s: shrinks to 10 or to seven or eight where
1603.44s: you get like this massive wave of like
1605.36s: unbelievable productivity I mean
1606.80s: something's coming I think I think we'll
1608.56s: see what it
1609.56s: is I think that that's like a really ad
1612.52s: depth comparison honestly and it leads
1615.36s: me to another thought which is when you
1618.84s: typically play at least a lot of your
1622.76s: search criteria for the stocks you're
1624.40s: looking for and stuff like that kind of
1626.08s: exhibits a certain pattern it'll you
1628.04s: know surge base or like that kind of
1629.96s: thing and when you look at the kind of
1633.24s: potential road map something like this
1636.20s: could have and the investments in this
1638.48s: could have does that adjust the way you
1641.76s: search for stocks because that time
1644.80s: frame can potentially be compressed so
1647.04s: much or is it something as you think
1649.60s: that the model that you employ now is
1653.04s: rigorous enough that it would adapt to
1655.04s: that new scenario equally as well I
1657.52s: think it's rigorous enough because you
1660.12s: know it's interesting if you take like
1661.96s: the recent Nvidia weekly chart uh and or
1665.48s: let's say arm which had a big move
1666.88s: recently and you can compare it to like
1668.76s: these same leading stocks in every cycle
1671.12s: it's just so it's so interesting like
1674.28s: you could look at these leading these
1675.88s: these stocks when they turn to these
1676.84s: leaders and it lasts for like that 6
1679.16s: months to to a year and a half typically
1681.00s: is like the cycle and the charts just
1683.40s: have a look like the way their
1685.80s: volatility you know comes down and they
1688.32s: Trend and it so like even in past Cycles
1692.84s: even though the the it lasted longer you
1695.56s: had a lot of stocks that I mean think of
1697.12s: dotc right they came out and was like
1698.68s: boom boom boom like just like these fast
1700.92s: spikes and moves and then those are
1702.32s: certain styles of stock so the fast wild
1705.00s: stuff has been seen in different ways so
1706.76s: I mean it depends how uh adaptable you
1708.88s: are but like I I I don't think the
1711.32s: compressed time frame is going to change
1713.72s: the Dynamics of how they operate I mean
1715.48s: you can see even arm recently came out
1717.00s: IPO made a nice base had that explosion
1719.72s: move same with Nvidia all the rest you
1721.28s: went up you based you went up you based
1722.96s: and you you went up again so recently I
1725.20s: was trading Taiwan semi similar you kind
1726.96s: of broke out you pulled back to your
1728.28s: average then you like you you had this
1730.08s: last late move so I think the patterns
1732.36s: are going to be the same I think that's
1733.52s: the strength of like this process I I
1735.72s: you know it's a uh you know like you
1738.24s: know can slim growth investing it's not
1741.08s: uh like a big secret I I think it works
1743.24s: the hard part is just bringing
1744.28s: everything together like there's no
1745.56s: secret there's no like super secret just
1747.88s: it's just it's just hard like to to to
1750.64s: balance everything and everything always
1752.56s: looks easier in hindsight it's like an
1754.76s: athlete you can look at like a baseball
1756.04s: player and say like oh okay I can hit a
1757.28s: baseball yeah I know but if the guy's
1758.60s: throwing at 102 miles an hour like it's
1760.48s: a different than when someone's lobing
1762.28s: it to you in like the the home field and
1764.36s: you're you're knocking it out you know
1765.72s: so it's one of those things like seems
1767.64s: easy on the surface but just takes a lot
1769.68s: of effort to make sure that every part
1772.32s: of your system works cohesively so you
1775.20s: don't you don't kind of mess it up at
1776.60s: any point because if you get one part
1778.52s: wrong like let's say risk management is
1779.88s: no good or position size is no good or
1781.80s: Market trend is no good it's it's like
1783.68s: you're GNA screw it up it's like a car
1784.96s: and your brakes don't work your
1786.56s: accelerator your accelerator doesn't
1788.08s: work like like one piece can't be broken
1790.00s: or it's not going to work that that
1791.20s: that's the hard part it's a great way to
1793.16s: frame it and especially for a system
1796.04s: like yours which is kind of predic ated
1798.32s: on Consolidated positioning but looking
1800.88s: for big
1801.92s: moves has kind of the past year been
1805.64s: difficult or have you adjusted your
1807.24s: sizing at all or has it been kind of
1809.56s: similar entry size protocols as you
1811.36s: typically would
1812.76s: run so it's it's pretty similar uh just
1815.92s: there's been a lot of chop so it's you
1818.08s: know again if you look at the like the
1819.80s: NASDAQ 100 it looks easier in the past
1822.64s: year than for what the experience is for
1824.52s: most other stocks out there that haven't
1826.24s: had the large cap feel so there's been a
1828.72s: lot of chop under this like everyone
1830.04s: forgets like last March there was like a
1831.68s: banking panic and all this other stuff
1833.40s: that was like going on that people
1834.52s: forget about you know because like the
1836.08s: Market's been strong lately but there's
1837.56s: been a lot of chop you know so I
1839.40s: typically try and stay with normal
1840.72s: positionings but if I'm a little bit
1842.60s: less like certain or the Market's been a
1844.16s: little more difficult I just like cut
1846.16s: them into a few more like a few smaller
1848.52s: buys but I still like so like I you know
1850.24s: when I start a position I want to get at
1851.36s: least 10% into a position if I'm
1853.52s: uncertain with markets I'll start at 5
1855.04s: six% but I force myself if it's going my
1857.56s: way to get to where I need to get to so
1859.40s: like I I don't just get smaller and stay
1861.64s: smaller I maybe I'll start smaller but
1863.28s: then I'll force my way in it's working
1865.28s: that way at least if it's a choppy
1866.96s: environment you're not just getting cut
1868.12s: to
1869.24s: Pieces yeah and so when you're thinking
1872.56s: about your buy
1875.64s: campaigns what's the time frame that
1878.16s: you're employing between like your first
1880.36s: entry at 10% or whatever the desirable
1884.00s: is and then the subsequent entries that
1886.64s: you're using so I like to kind of build
1889.56s: into a stock over let's say one or two
1892.80s: weeks typically and and when thing when
1895.64s: you get things right like usually I
1898.12s: found that the markets move in these
1899.76s: nice like three to five month Cycles
1901.96s: where like you'll get these big powerful
1904.52s: moves and the stocks go crazy and then
1906.24s: then the good stocks will base and have
1907.76s: another one again some will just top and
1910.28s: you won't hear from them anymore uh so
1912.76s: that's so like my personal like ideal
1915.16s: favorite and it doesn't always capture
1916.96s: the whole move but my ideal favor is
1919.04s: kind of build over one to two weeks you
1920.92s: know but do that over a few stocks when
1922.56s: when the Market's coming out of a
1923.68s: correction and then three to four five
1925.52s: months later you're selling most of that
1927.00s: stuff off like if you look back
1928.16s: historically at all the bull markets you
1930.44s: get these strong waves and these small
1932.16s: these Corrections and then another wave
1933.68s: and and really it comes in these waves
1936.00s: could you show me a little bit about the
1938.40s: way that you might play something like
1940.72s: arm
1941.88s: historically the reason why I ask is
1943.96s: because one of the things I find
1946.00s: honestly so fascinating about the way
1948.92s: that you trade is well I think a lot of
1951.92s: traders in general you eventually turn
1954.12s: the corner where you're not afraid to
1955.48s: buy something that's gone up right
1957.12s: that's kind of like a base level you got
1959.28s: to get that sooner kind of thing but
1962.20s: what I find really interesting about the
1965.04s: way that you're trading is for me like
1967.72s: the process of doing that over like a
1969.60s: week or two weeks I would struggle with
1972.24s: that but I imagine my my holding time is
1975.20s: probably way shorter than yours so I
1977.32s: imagine that's why there's like that
1978.80s: dissonance in my mind so yeah I was just
1981.00s: curious if maybe we could take a look at
1982.64s: Armor really whatever else I can grab
1984.28s: anything that you want um and I just
1986.08s: want to explore what that that looks
1987.76s: like so this is a good one because this
1989.60s: is one I actually put on recently so if
1991.60s: you kind of uh if you can move the chart
1993.24s: a little more to the left like at the
1994.72s: IPO
1996.24s: period you want to go further back in
1998.40s: time yeah further back let's say last
2000.08s: fall last October or what got it yeah
2004.04s: okay it's a little bit of a scrunch
2005.32s: chart but
2006.76s: uh do you want to go all and zoom in
2009.84s: over here yeah that like that area up
2012.08s: until uh let's say February I don't know
2014.08s: if you can yeah like that'd be great
2015.96s: yeah yeah I don't know if you can adjust
2018.32s: a scale on the right or make it a log or
2021.84s: just yeah okay that that's better yeah
2024.96s: so you know and you bring up a good
2026.12s: point too because a lot of people will
2027.40s: ask me like you know Matt you a market
2028.72s: maker you're a day trader like you must
2030.20s: have these great insights from like
2031.60s: intraday and and and it brought a lot of
2034.48s: help because I could I could see how why
2036.52s: patterns form like it's one thing to
2037.76s: learned the theory but to really see why
2039.36s: they form that way but to your point it
2042.24s: took me a long time to go from like
2044.12s: making 200 trades in a day to like
2046.56s: holding a stock for three months like
2048.16s: for you know people who've never the
2050.00s: shorter term side it's like w three
2052.36s: what's three months but when you're used
2054.04s: to like being in and out over and over
2055.76s: and over to like sit with the stock and
2057.36s: you have this open profit and you're
2058.56s: just watching it like Bobble up and down
2060.52s: it's it's a like psychologically it's a
2062.52s: very hard transition to make but that's
2065.48s: a discussion for another day I guess I
2067.84s: guess so uh so this example here so you
2070.16s: can see um we looking at like that see
2072.68s: that low at 46 and a half there that's
2074.92s: sticking out so that was kind of the
2076.16s: corrective phase uh and as we kind of uh
2078.92s: start to work up the right side yeah
2082.00s: into like I think I'm not what averages
2083.80s: are those Eric that let's see that uh
2086.60s: the you mean the moving averages or the
2088.32s: mov yeah so there's probably more than
2091.04s: we need um but there's like a 10 20 50
2096.20s: and then a 150 that's really dark one
2098.64s: okay yeah that makes sense yeah so when
2100.12s: we ran up into that 50 the first time
2101.96s: you can see like uh yeah so like yeah so
2105.04s: that's kind of where I put my first
2106.36s: initial positioning on and then after as
2109.24s: it kind of Consolidated for a few days
2110.76s: and we had that other like kind of large
2112.16s: candle that broke higher I kind of added
2113.72s: to the position and then we went up one
2116.04s: more time and we kind of had that
2117.56s: sideways consolidation we kind of put
2119.28s: that handle on the right side of the
2120.52s: base and so as I broke out of there on
2123.36s: that day I I kind of finished off the
2125.44s: buy so this this is actually I told you
2128.04s: earlier like I think nine out of 11
2129.52s: stocks gap down for me like on the
2131.28s: recent earnings season this is one that
2133.60s: gapped up for me so I I this this kind
2135.44s: of ran up into earnings I had puts for
2137.32s: protection and I actually have an IPO
2139.64s: sell rule that I used first it was from
2142.20s: experience and I went back to study and
2143.48s: I saw how it was helpful but basically
2145.68s: if I buy a stock coming out of a recent
2147.80s: IPO and it goes up let's say 80 to 100%
2150.24s: from about the middle of the base I'll
2152.28s: just sell it into strength because then
2153.72s: typically you have the you know the sh
2156.16s: the lockup expiry com and you have
2158.16s: people who have stock from pennies who
2159.96s: just want to take their big profit and
2161.64s: buy their mansion so just naturally you
2163.68s: get that bad break a couple of months
2166.24s: later and it has to reset up like like
2168.16s: arm ended up doing so I kind of built
2170.28s: that up in those stages on the way up
2172.92s: and then after coming out of that
2174.28s: earnings actually that first big candle
2176.04s: that launched out of earnings I sold
2178.00s: that into like the 115 120 area and then
2181.08s: two days later the next morning I was
2182.80s: happy when it opened back at 100 then
2184.28s: the next day I was miserable as I went
2185.60s: to 160 but uh then ultimately I think it
2188.28s: fell back down to like 80 something and
2189.96s: now we had another another recent leg up
2192.20s: again yeah so then so that so this bad
2195.12s: break you can see there that that's most
2197.40s: IPOs if you look even if they're
2198.60s: successful longer term there's always
2200.12s: like after that initial like double that
2202.36s: really nasty break where insiders like
2204.68s: they if you bought if you got a stock as
2206.60s: an employee at a
2207.96s: dollar and you know you suddenly have
2210.04s: this multi-million dollar like are do
2211.64s: you care if you're selling at 120 or 110
2213.96s: or 105 you just want to take the money
2216.00s: before disappears so they you end up
2218.08s: having this really aggressive seller uh
2220.40s: that comes to market after an
2222.88s: IPO and then does your original thesis
2226.20s: maintain are you looking to then enter
2228.52s: back in or do you view this as it made
2231.76s: my move I'm going elsewhere no so I mean
2235.20s: like the young stocks are usually the
2237.00s: nice stock so once it has that like bad
2239.20s: post IPO break it can set up again just
2242.04s: needs to kind of set up a nice structure
2243.76s: this was a bit odd because it kind of
2245.08s: had that bad break into April and then
2247.32s: just kind of like rolled back up to new
2249.24s: High so it wasn't like a traditional way
2252.24s: way it'll typically do I mean there's
2253.64s: always a random variation so I I didn't
2256.08s: catch the second move I I was playing
2257.68s: with it a couple of days and I got
2259.00s: knocked out of it and ended up going
2260.28s: without me um but they can set up again
2264.24s: and have like nice continued legs you
2266.04s: just want to avoid that first nasty bad
2267.88s: break after the IPO or what
2270.12s: know yeah it's it's actually really
2272.72s: interesting to hear the way that you
2273.96s: played it because this this was where I
2276.40s: ended up getting in
2278.40s: but well not nice right is I listen to
2281.56s: you getting in here and then doubling
2284.04s: right I'm I'm getting Pennies on the
2285.48s: dollar like a freaking peasant but I
2288.76s: guess that's that is the beauty of
2290.32s: trying to find derivatives is you don't
2292.20s: need quite as much of a move in order to
2294.72s: be happy with it but it's not always
2297.68s: especially in stuff like this like newer
2299.28s: products sometimes they don't offer
2301.04s: Doros sometimes they're not liquid so
2303.68s: you kind of get priced out of some of
2305.04s: those moves now when you're looking at
2307.64s: this what would be the way you view
2310.40s: re-entry is this something that is kind
2313.04s: of like on a watch list that you revisit
2315.24s: until it sets up and it's lower on your
2317.04s: priority list because there's other
2318.36s: stuff that's kind of at a more
2320.68s: advantageous stage of its growth I'm
2323.60s: curious how you kind of cycle through
2325.60s: your stable of stocks that you conducted
2327.88s: your original analysis on you like it
2330.04s: you traded it you got your exit but the
2333.28s: overall thesis may be the essentially
2335.40s: the same yeah so I keep like a general
2338.00s: list like now there's about a 100 stocks
2339.48s: on it where uh like there's two like
2342.56s: like there's two criteria like I want
2343.96s: those that have the good fundamental
2345.40s: story behind them and or that they're
2347.20s: showing really great relative strength
2348.72s: so ideally the ones I actually trade
2350.44s: have both but you know if you don't keep
2353.00s: them on a list and watch them sometimes
2354.52s: things change and then you just miss
2355.60s: them so I keep this big list so for
2357.16s: example arm is one where it's ever since
2358.96s: I traded stayed on my list as the watch
2361.64s: uh because just this the fundamentals
2363.68s: the growth the trajectory is all
2365.32s: fantastic but it had that bad break so
2367.20s: then you're looking for other
2368.16s: opportunities but you're still the daily
2370.04s: weekly review is still coming up in your
2371.96s: process got it it makes sense too
2374.12s: especially because the way that you
2375.72s: explain what you think that break comes
2378.00s: from to me that would be a nonf factor
2380.60s: then right if it's just a bunch of
2381.76s: insiders that are wanting to unwind
2383.44s: their position I mean I I don't care
2385.60s: that's that doesn't change the
2386.76s: fundamental picture of it if that's the
2389.84s: you know it's fun speaking to like what
2391.40s: we spoke about before I was seeing
2392.44s: people ask like you know did your
2393.44s: experience as a market maker and stuff
2394.84s: help like I think that's somewhere like
2397.36s: situation like that it helps because you
2398.80s: can see the impact of like you know
2402.20s: again like you go to school and everyone
2403.24s: talks about efficient market and like
2404.88s: rational investor and like then you've
2406.96s: seen like you like when you're like
2408.32s: trading shortterm you see fills where
2409.92s: people are just like selling a stock but
2412.00s: in a ridiculous way I mean like say why
2413.96s: didn't you take your time you would have
2415.12s: gotten like such better ex because for
2417.40s: some people their motivation is not
2418.76s: about best price execution their
2420.28s: motivation and you see that could be an
2421.52s: institution who needs to liquidate or I
2423.40s: mean I've seen all kinds of crazy stuff
2424.72s: over the years where like they're forced
2425.92s: liquidation or what where sometimes it's
2428.16s: not uh best price is not the priority
2430.64s: it's just get me out now I want it now
2432.52s: it could be because I want a bolt or
2433.60s: because I'm forced because of a legal
2434.80s: proceeding or whatever so it's like so
2437.84s: you know for some people like they can't
2439.20s: understand like why why would somebody
2440.72s: do that there everyone has their their
2442.88s: their pushes and and a lot of times it's
2444.76s: not the rational investor mindset you
2447.00s: know and I always joke like I know like
2448.84s: investors aren't rational because I've
2450.12s: been irrational myself enough times that
2451.96s: I've broken the uh I've broken the model
2453.88s: so the market can't be that that
2456.24s: efficient well it's funny too I I've
2458.60s: been following the whole GameStop Saga
2461.96s: just from specifically derivatives
2463.72s: perspective it's been absolutely
2465.00s: fascinating and somebody they asked me a
2466.80s: question about like the there's GameStop
2470.08s: right now is at like
2471.44s: 2559 and they were asking about these
2474.88s: 125 calls that expir tomorrow that
2478.96s: expired tomorrow are they and they were
2481.88s: the massive open interest in these 125
2485.20s: calls that yes I'll I'll I'll hold on
2487.52s: I'll show it to you cuz it's amazing
2489.52s: it's hilarious I hope it's at least
2491.56s: worth pennies I mean I hope it's not so
2493.24s: it's it's literally it's bid it's B at a
2495.96s: penny offered at two you have to come
2498.20s: all the way down here look at this
2500.84s: 113,000 oi on this 125 call for tomorrow
2505.44s: and you can still get I feel like that's
2506.48s: a free penny I mean obviously I I like
2509.64s: and what I try to explain to people you
2511.68s: know they're really fascinated by the
2513.16s: implied volatility of these really far
2514.96s: outof the- money options and I I try to
2517.64s: explain to them one this is telling you
2520.08s: that if you're buying this you are
2521.72s: buying this at a crazy price relative to
2525.40s: what it is the second thing is this kind
2528.44s: of can be indicative from a market
2530.16s: making perspective how they view their
2531.88s: risk right because if you look at
2534.28s: something like apple it'll still have
2537.04s: kind of a crazy
2538.76s: smile where if I close this down like
2542.04s: you can still see even in a near-term
2544.32s: expiration it'll have a big smile right
2546.96s: where that the out ofth the money puts
2548.48s: they're over 2,000% IV but you don't
2552.08s: typically see you know the call side
2554.12s: quite as high but GameStop is one of
2556.88s: those crazy crazy products that it's
2560.68s: just been wild to watch I can I mean
2563.44s: from a market making perspective that
2564.96s: has got to be like a field day yeah it's
2567.84s: wild I me it could be dangerous you know
2569.84s: a lot of guys get caught on stuff like
2571.16s: that because well now like people
2573.00s: understand but like and I I know
2575.20s: everyone was was railing on the guys who
2576.92s: were short and I think they were like
2578.56s: abusing the short perspective like they
2580.16s: really were they still are over short
2582.20s: they still are so like they're in the
2583.56s: wrong in that perspective but like uh
2585.72s: you can't I mean assuming the person is
2588.12s: not like abusing their power as a sh
2590.24s: like I've seen like market makers
2591.48s: sometimes they just get on the wrong
2592.52s: side they no idea story's coming and
2595.00s: they get run over and like the poor guy
2596.92s: was just like you know he's just putting
2598.16s: his trade on he's not trying to
2599.24s: manipulate markets and the guy months of
2601.52s: work because of some random you know
2603.92s: like so I've seen both sides I I I could
2606.64s: I could have some sense of uh you know
2609.28s: sadness for the market maker sometimes
2610.88s: you know I've seen that side of things
2613.00s: well especially from the retail side on
2614.68s: this thing I think there's a little bit
2616.32s: of um you know just angst towards like
2619.64s: the
2620.36s: institutions and the market makers they
2622.44s: can play games I'm sure you know that
2624.36s: right but I mean it's to to the extent
2627.08s: orderflow still dictates the vast
2629.88s: majority of their debt so yeah it's this
2634.08s: kind of thing is really interesting to
2635.56s: watch but pivoting out real quick when
2639.20s: we first spoke well two times ago we
2642.60s: were talking about the fed and what the
2644.84s: Fed was doing interest rate environment
2647.32s: then the last time we spoke I think the
2650.04s: market was still looking at three Cuts
2652.24s: still pricing in three cuts big change
2655.32s: and now the Market's looking at two
2657.60s: fed's still talking about
2659.52s: one what do you make of the r
2662.56s: environment and the
2664.40s: impact I think uh well look I always
2667.32s: like to say that the Federal Reserve
2669.28s: federal funds rate should just follow
2670.96s: the US two-year yield like ultimately
2673.20s: that that's always where it gets to and
2674.84s: if they're too far below it like they
2676.60s: were like in you know post financial
2678.56s: crisis it's like you're creating an
2680.28s: asset bubble if you're too if you're too
2681.64s: far above it like you were going into
2683.52s: the financial crisis or like other
2685.24s: periods like you're you're creating like
2688.16s: economic weakness so you know you have
2689.80s: this big board of people which really
2691.40s: all they should just do is let the
2692.32s: market decide the right interest rate
2693.80s: which is the capital is free market way
2695.68s: and the right way to do it uh but if you
2697.60s: look at so if you look at the current
2698.88s: weight like the two-year yield is has
2700.80s: come off and it's it's quite it's about
2702.44s: I think it's three quarters of a point
2703.60s: below federal funds more or less and I
2706.16s: think again so much is is
2709.56s: um adjusted or is affected by this large
2713.20s: cap Tech rally because if you look
2715.40s: anywhere else I think you can really see
2717.52s: the economic weakness building so if you
2720.00s: look at the Canadian Market it's soft if
2721.68s: you look at even US market equal weight
2723.56s: or small Caps or uh Russ even S&P wait I
2727.52s: mean hasn't done a whole lot for for a
2728.96s: number of months if you look at European
2730.44s: markets where they have like no
2731.72s: technology sector like France I think
2733.92s: last week fell like 10% Germany fell six
2736.68s: s% Italian Markets fell more so I mean
2739.56s: like obviously it's a completely
2740.84s: different type of economy but if you
2742.48s: want to look at like the the non-te
2745.12s: component like just the pure economy is
2747.08s: probably a better representation just
2748.68s: for the fact that it doesn't have that
2749.92s: distorted effects of Nvidia Microsoft
2752.48s: Apple so I I think and I think that's
2755.08s: why uh ECB cut a quarter point why can
2758.76s: cut a quarter point because I think
2759.72s: they're starting to see like you know
2761.44s: when trying to balance the risks of
2763.04s: inflation and economic weakness it's
2764.96s: it's not so clear a distinction anymore
2767.76s: that inflation is the only the biggest
2769.48s: problem like inflation is getting closer
2771.20s: to 2% uh but and I think at the same
2773.76s: time they're TR to say like we are
2774.80s: actually getting weakness you know by
2776.20s: the time like it comes through it's
2777.64s: always late you know before everyone
2778.88s: realizes it but I think you are seeing
2781.08s: that I think most stocks are reflecting
2783.64s: that just so happens that you know the
2785.92s: cohort of of seven you know Magnificent
2788.68s: Seven stocks are are in a world of their
2790.28s: own and that distorts things but
2791.60s: everything else I think is starting to
2792.84s: reflect the economic weakness and so I
2794.92s: think from that perspective looking at
2796.60s: the two-year yield I think the FED is
2799.88s: probably becoming a bit slow to kind of
2801.92s: remove the restrictive stance I I know
2803.88s: it's like from Powell's and this is from
2805.76s: Powell's perspective if you put yourself
2807.40s: in his shoes it's easier and he said
2810.12s: this it's easier to revive a weak
2812.64s: economy than it is to stop inflation as
2815.16s: we've seen inflation is very sticky so I
2817.52s: think he would rather and then if you
2819.12s: put yourself in his shoes it kind of I
2821.32s: probably would want to do the same thing
2822.96s: you're a little more willing to like
2824.20s: make things break a little bit you can
2825.64s: say okay here's some QE here's some
2826.88s: lower rates everyone we're fine that's a
2828.88s: lot easier to stop then once inflation
2830.56s: gets inside people's minds and it's just
2832.16s: self-fulfilling prophecy so I think they
2835.36s: probably see that things are starting to
2836.88s: soften but they're willing to to play to
2839.48s: the risk that the economy weakend
2842.24s: without having inflation get away from
2843.80s: them yeah I agree with that and the the
2846.16s: other thing I was thinking about anyways
2847.60s: is just the timeline right like if we if
2850.08s: the market is still pressing in two cuts
2851.88s: which is what I saw last time from the
2853.40s: bond markets or the uh the bom Futures
2855.60s: and I just I think we're running out of
2858.16s: time for that man because when I'm
2861.88s: considering the way that the FED has
2863.76s: played this so far they've obviously
2866.08s: been kind of slow rolling and kind of
2868.76s: for a lot of the reasons that you were
2869.84s: just outlining but then I look at
2872.48s: whenever they make their first cut the
2875.48s: probability of there being a second cut
2879.20s: in the very next meeting I have to
2882.16s: imagine is very low unless the economy
2885.80s: is showing massive signs of
2887.80s: weakness when you think about playing
2891.68s: the potential cut well is that anything
2893.48s: that you are looking to play anyways it
2895.08s: sounds like it might not even be
2896.12s: necessarily a big impact to the stuff
2898.00s: you're trading but I'm curious if you
2899.56s: have a play around it well yeah just
2901.96s: like for myself like I mean so like most
2903.72s: stuff I do is kind of growth related but
2905.84s: I'm starting to look at some like just
2907.12s: you know there's different accounts that
2908.16s: I have like I think some of the high
2909.68s: dividend payers are going to be
2911.64s: attractive because I think if the
2913.32s: economic slowness comes in and and most
2915.00s: of these stocks not done great but I
2917.36s: imagine a lot of them will start to kind
2918.56s: of get a bid as interest rates fall the
2920.64s: yield will become even more and you're
2921.76s: going to get that kind of realignment I
2923.16s: think you'll get like that Capital
2924.40s: basically it's like a bond proxy and I
2926.16s: think you're trying to see like that
2927.24s: even the TLT which is like another the
2929.28s: bond ETF trying to make that higher low
2931.80s: so I think that's probably the way you
2933.12s: play it I think if the market does
2935.32s: correct but then ultimately this this
2938.00s: drop in rates is going to support the
2940.28s: more speculative side of the market as
2942.16s: well because like all this time that's
2943.44s: why it's been large CS because with high
2945.36s: rates anything speculative is under
2946.96s: pressure and and so I think when rates
2948.76s: fall that'll be another kind of Notch in
2950.48s: the belt for more speculative growth as
2952.76s: well so I'm I'm starting to kind of look
2955.28s: to see who would would win coming out of
2957.32s: that and that's kind of the bond proxies
2959.12s: and that is is just a trade I'm looking
2960.60s: at as well yeah yeah it's funny it's
2963.84s: it's so whenever I talk to you man like
2965.40s: there's so many parallels we we just
2966.92s: have a slightly different way of like
2968.20s: approaching markets but I I've even in
2971.00s: the beginning of this year I was long
2972.52s: small caps I was long bonds trying to
2974.72s: front run a little bit of that uptick
2977.04s: that we first thought the cut was going
2978.36s: to be March then they moved it then they
2980.52s: moved it then I was just like all right
2982.28s: man fine I'll take the trades a low you
2984.60s: move the capital somewhere else I'll go
2986.52s: be a dgen and load up in tle Qs yall put
2989.60s: twist my arm but yeah just the the way
2993.48s: that you're thinking about it is
2994.80s: honestly very very similar to
2997.28s: I think what I found interesting so far
3000.16s: has been the dissonance between the
3001.92s: market and what the FED has actually
3003.28s: done because I typically think the fed
3005.76s: and the market align a little more
3008.00s: closely based on historic references
3009.60s: that I saw in terms of kind of like
3011.00s: policy messaging and then follow through
3013.04s: and this seems like a pretty big
3015.48s: disparity last question for you when
3019.72s: you're looking at the rest of the year
3022.84s: what are you most interested in
3025.52s: following along
3027.96s: I think uh I think the election's going
3029.56s: to have a big
3030.80s: impact interesting I mean I don't want
3032.80s: to get into politics uh but you know I I
3035.92s: think uh again whether you're a Democrat
3038.92s: or Republican so I always try and just
3040.80s: like talk from an economic perspective
3042.44s: like from an economic perspective lower
3044.28s: taxes is is just better for the economy
3046.88s: and and the stock market because I think
3048.56s: lower lower
3050.00s: taxes look economics 101 is taxes
3053.24s: there's a dead weight loss to a tax you
3055.08s: know the government kind of like has to
3056.84s: tax you and they're they're they're
3058.04s: poorer allocators of resources than the
3060.20s: individual is who actually earned it so
3062.28s: I think cutting tax um tax will help I
3067.20s: don't know if Trump gets reelected but I
3068.92s: mean I know Biden's not popular I think
3070.88s: if there is a change I think people will
3073.08s: whether it's whether Trump gets the
3074.32s: nomination or whatever I think just from
3075.84s: an economic perspective that'll probably
3077.56s: put a jolt I think into the economy and
3079.44s: I think that's why in 2016 he had his
3081.16s: big tax pet plans which he did put
3082.68s: through which helped the economy and all
3085.16s: that I think if you look at Canada where
3087.12s: we've had uh like higher taxes they just
3089.48s: raise the capital gains tax and like I
3092.04s: always like to say these things like
3093.68s: people think these are long-term things
3095.40s: or you know it's not to want to help
3097.16s: others but I think it's does a
3098.68s: disservice to everyone because look
3100.12s: Canada's productivity is the worst of
3101.56s: the G7 now we are one of the best and
3103.52s: now we're we're dead last in the I mean
3105.64s: Italy's doing better than us you know
3106.84s: what I mean like all these countries
3107.72s: that you would think that you wouldn't
3108.68s: think of as having stronger growth
3110.08s: economies are are doing better in terms
3112.08s: of productivity and the rest so you
3113.68s: better be careful Throwing Shade at
3115.08s: Italy because if I'm not Aken you might
3117.52s: be checking them out soon yeah exactly
3120.84s: I'm going down in July I'm going to do
3122.28s: my economic inspection that's why I'm
3123.68s: going yeah yeah you you better be
3125.08s: careful over there you might run into a
3126.40s: few dudes
3127.88s: hey I have some family in some areas so
3130.28s: I have to make sure not to go to the
3131.44s: local towns I I'll get the I'll get
3133.36s: thrown out but uh no but you know so
3136.12s: like but these economic policies have a
3137.44s: real impact like maybe not week to week
3139.28s: but looking over a year two years and
3140.80s: and the Market's going to respond and so
3142.96s: I think that could be I think if you get
3144.20s: the Catalyst I mean if you look at a
3146.52s: perfect world of like let's say taxes
3148.96s: coming down or you know and I think this
3151.40s: is where even you know Trump I think his
3153.56s: policy he was a big FIS big spender so
3156.00s: you know that that was maybe a negative
3157.52s: the government spends too much to become
3158.92s: too big a part of the economy so that's
3160.96s: not I'm not saying I'm a a raing fan of
3163.28s: either side I always trying to stay
3164.48s: politically neutral in talks but uh just
3167.16s: at least on the tax side if you figure
3168.88s: if you get like any help from tax then
3170.96s: after you get uh falling interest rates
3173.24s: and you get uh a technological
3175.12s: Revolution I mean you have three things
3177.12s: like pushing in the same direction and
3179.08s: you get inflation under control so you
3180.60s: get like back to stable currency lower
3182.80s: rates hopefully better uh better taxes
3186.24s: and a technological that like sets up
3188.12s: like a really promising 2025 so like I
3192.48s: think in a perfect world because we've
3193.80s: had like a big run to indexes because of
3195.72s: the big cap Tech you correct into
3197.96s: September October and then you get all
3199.40s: of these catalysts at once like fed
3201.32s: cutting it's like I think 2025 could be
3203.72s: a really exciting year
3206.60s: you heard it here first plus also
3209.00s: everybody don't forget to to clip that
3211.08s: part about Matt talking trash about
3213.16s: Italy's productivity gotta make sure
3215.76s: that gets out there but uh Matt as
3218.04s: always man absolute pleasure hanging out
3219.76s: with you chatting markets with you is
