0.00s: What's up, outliers. Welcome back to the Outlier podcast. I have David Hunter back. I think
6.72s: this is like episode six or so. I don't even know anymore. We've connected pretty much
11.32s: every quarter, like pretty consistently for a couple of years now. And I would love
16.56s: first to just start with a quick recap of 24 because when we connected in the beginning
22.48s: of 2024, you had an expectation of this really strong rally, the melt up and then leading
29.34s: eventually into the global bus. And originally, we were thinking that that might be happening
34.16s: towards the tail end of last year. Obviously, circumstances continue to change. That's
38.68s: actually a follow up question I have for you for a little bit. But I would love to just
43.26s: get an overview from you on 2024. What were the key themes that stuck out to you?
49.46s: Yeah, well, certainly, yeah, we had bought, we had had a pretty good correction going
56.08s: into the fall of 23 came out of that in October early November of 23. And it took until
67.02s: I think February, if I remember right before we started taking off, maybe that was just
72.16s: the medals. But I had raised my target 7,000, I think in January of 24. And we had a run
84.36s: and we had a correction, another run. And then August yet, and we had the big probably
93.34s: the biggest story of of 24 was the Japanese Yankei trade unwind. It didn't take very
103.12s: long, but it was pretty, pretty sharp and scared a lot of people and a lot of people turned
108.52s: to bear us there. And yet it bottomed in early August, you know, it was almost a one day
114.82s: sell off. There was some weakness leading up to it, but the biggest sell off was a one
119.78s: or two day deal. And then we basically had a pretty good run into the election and the
128.98s: week after the election. And then another kind of holiday run after Thanksgiving or into
136.24s: Thanksgiving and beyond. And then we thought we were going to have a year in rally and really
141.46s: from mid December and for the Russell early December, we had topped and corrected right
148.40s: into your end. So it surprised people, I think a little because everybody assumed we'd
153.70s: have a year in rally, but that's the market. You know, when everybody assumes something,
158.38s: you're going to probably get the opposite. And, you know, we're starting off this year
164.72s: kind of choppy. So what has been amazing is it has rebuilt the Wall of War. You know,
172.34s: it doesn't take a lot to have people, they got on board because of what the market did
178.04s: in the fall when they saw, you know, the S&P go above 6,000. Also, yeah, everybody
184.44s: raised it, you know, their numbers for 2025. They're there. You're in 25 Wall Street
190.64s: strategist year and 25 estimates all jumped up, you know, 6,500, 6,600, a couple of more
198.78s: at 7,000 or 7,100. And this was from a crowd that, you know, a group of people who had fought
205.92s: the rally all the way up from 3,500. You know, they just didn't think they had legs and
210.88s: kept moving. They were skeptical the whole way until, you know, really the last, you
217.18s: know, just leading at the election beyond. And then just as we get that and they
225.04s: climb on board, the bull bandwagon, we get this correction. And I think, you know, for
231.90s: the S&P it was a less than 5% correction for the Nasdaq 6% or 6,500. And for the Russell
241.14s: it was over 10. But it's amazing to see that once you lose that momentum, and I had said
249.30s: this ahead of time, yeah, they're bullish, but they're bullish without any conviction.
253.42s: They're bullish because they're going with the momentum of the tape. You lose that momentum
257.86s: and they're right back on the bearer side or at least skeptical side. And that's what
262.62s: you've seen here very recently. And so if you look at individual sentiment, because I
269.82s: just saw this number, the balls are down to like 20, I think 24%, the bears are up to
276.14s: 40%. And that had been the opposite, you know, just a few weeks ago. So it's amazing
283.10s: how quickly, you know, a little bit of a pullback can cause sentiment change.
289.26s: Absolutely. And it's one of the things I wanted to follow up there with is your original
295.54s: expectation of a meltup, meaning a really sharp parabolic move up. How does this change
303.26s: in sentiment feed into that? Because it does seem like things have stalled quite a
308.46s: lot. And exactly to your point, I actually found it generally interesting where essentially
313.74s: from December, it just seemed like the market was kind of waiting for the shoot to drop,
318.82s: which I surprised me a little bit because if we're expecting this really big rally,
325.02s: right, it seems like it would have to be supported by a ton of capital of some sort
329.58s: coming in. So two questions there. The first one is, what do you think about the current
335.94s: marketing condition and how does that feed into the meltup concept?
341.38s: Yeah. Well, first of all, just to kind of clarify, meltup and parabolic meltup are two
348.06s: different things. Okay, sorry. The meltup, we've really had a meltup. You could argue,
354.06s: depending on how, why do you want to make the, how, why the perspective you want to have,
358.86s: if you broaden the market out to 20 year charts, you'd see the market's pretty vertical from
365.26s: 2022 from the lows in October 2022. And now some people think that was not that whole
371.50s: thing of the meltup, but we did, we did have a pretty long correction in the summer into
377.02s: the fall of 23. And then bottomed in October 23. So I, I really think the meltup is from my,
386.06s: that October 23 until now is we're in the meltup. The parabolic part of the meltup is that last
394.54s: stage into the top. And I had thought it was starting, I had thought it had started after the
403.58s: election. I said, at least possibly, you know, that 5% run in the week of the election.
409.10s: If it sustained itself was a beginning of what I think we're going to see, which is, you know,
413.90s: very fast, steep run to the top. But it's stalled out. And we've kind of gone sideways since. So
421.50s: in sideways to down. So, so that wasn't the beginning of the parabolic. I think the parabolic
428.78s: just ahead of us. And I, you know, I think you could cover 30% in the S.A.P. in a matter of two or
436.38s: three months. Maybe it'll take longer, maybe it'll take four or five. But that's a lot of return in a
441.90s: hurry. Huge. And so that just to clarify those two, then, then if you could refresh my memory on
450.38s: your questions. I'm curious how the current market behavior feeds into that broader theory.
456.46s: Yeah. I mean, I view it as we're in that process. You know, we're so spoiled because we haven't had
465.34s: big pullbacks. We're, you know, we're getting these two, three, four, five percent pullbacks.
472.06s: And those seem now to be big pullbacks or not. And, you know, historically, we just haven't had
479.42s: this kind of a straight up market. So, you know, people are more conditioned to have seven to
485.58s: eight or 10% corrections. Now, if we get a four or five percent correction, people are saying,
491.10s: what's wrong with the market? I mean, this is just the market refreshes itself, you know, to stir
496.06s: set process. And each time it pulls back, it causes a sentiment, vericentment to increase.
503.66s: Obviously, investors act on that sentiment a lot of the time. So that means they're getting
509.66s: more defensive, they're raising more cash. It's rebuilding the skepticism that you need to keep
517.26s: going higher. What you have to worry about is when sentiment gets so bullish that everybody's
522.30s: in agreement that this thing's going so much higher. That means they've acted on that and you're
527.74s: already at the top. So that's coming, but we're not there all now.
533.34s: Leads to an interesting follow on based on your comment around perception around pullbacks and
540.70s: like severity. What I find really interesting is on some of these exactly to your point, lighter pullbacks,
547.02s: we're actually seeing the VIX spike not crazily, but pretty meaningfully. And what does that mean to
555.26s: you then? Is it like just broader institutional support of that theory where we've become so
561.82s: complacent where a 4% 5% pullback is seen as VIX needs to go to 25 now because of this small pullback,
570.94s: which we typically wouldn't necessarily see to that degree. Yeah, I can't remember when that last
576.78s: spike was where the VIX went up above 30, I think, or got to 30. Yeah, it looks like that happened
585.34s: on the 18th of December and the VIX hit a high of 2832. And then the last time it was above 30 was
594.22s: during that August pullback where everything kind of rolled over a little bit. Yeah, the August one,
599.10s: for sure, was people panicked and that was people were so sure that we were heading straight down.
605.50s: They had a lot of estimates of big drops. It thought that was just the start of something much bigger.
611.98s: So that was a high of, sorry, I was just going to throw out their VIX hit a high of 65.
617.42s: Yeah, yeah. And that's that's the sign of real panic. The one in December, I can't
624.38s: ever, you know, it's funny. I can't even remember what it was that triggered the pop. There had to be
631.58s: some news about that. But yeah, that coincided with or came soon after the top of the market because
640.62s: the market top or the market top right around there because it was peaceful. And I can't remember what
649.34s: the news event was. Do you remember I can't it's funny. Yeah, that's what there had to be something there.
658.46s: Yeah, it may have been, it may have been the pop in interest rates. Because interest rates had gone up from
668.78s: 360 up to three to, yeah, to four 20 or 430 and then started to come back down maybe even up to
678.70s: four 40 started to come back down. And then I think we might have gotten a bad CPI report. Or,
685.42s: yeah, that's what I think it was. It was inflation. And that spooked everybody and yields went from
693.18s: three, you know, they had come back down from three 40 to I think three 20. Next thing you know,
698.14s: they were at 360 on their way to three 80, 10 year. So I think that was if I remember right that
704.70s: was what triggered it was the fear that the 18th was also the I'm pretty sure there was a fed
711.18s: meeting around there, a fed announcement. Yeah, it was right in there. Yeah, because the CPI may have
716.22s: come out just before that. Yeah, just the amazing thing was Paul's press conference. Right.
723.26s: I remember that being so noteworthy. I was just like the market is crashing on him essentially
727.50s: saying the same thing. Yeah, it was, you know, he's basically telling you we cut rates in September.
735.58s: We cut again in November and December. And we may have to sit for a little while and wait for the
741.02s: data that tells what to do next. I thought we knew that going in. Why is everybody panicking?
747.74s: But that was the story. So again, there's a case where right around there going into that,
756.22s: you had was one people were giving you their year in 2025 numbers. You know, the
761.82s: striges on the street are telling you about the next year and starting to give you the year end
767.02s: numbers. And so they had they had raised all their numbers right before that. And which I guess
773.58s: is a sign that they were too comfortable, you know, gotten pretty bullish. Like I said, without
781.42s: conviction, but they were bullish because the tape was up. And they just didn't have, there was
786.70s: no resilience in the market for bad things. And they interpreted whatever he said as a change,
792.22s: you know, wasn't really. But and along with that was an error that we were seeing in some of the data
799.66s: that the economy was better than expected was starting to show more resilience, not rolling over.
805.18s: You know, and and that inflation was ticking up. So even though none of that concerned me,
812.46s: it's your concern the street leads to a follow on. This is one that continues to confound me. I just
819.02s: wrapped up my 18th year of trading, which I mentioned to you because it's funnier than anything.
824.54s: You've been in markets more than double that. But I find it so interesting because
830.78s: my my general expectation is that institutions are pretty smart. They probably have people that are
836.62s: close to Powell. In some capacity, you know, they're probably hearing things being talked about here
841.26s: and there not to go so far as insider information necessarily, but probably not off the table.
847.10s: It's just so surprising to me to see when the Fed comes out and they essentially reiterate
853.50s: similar guidance to see the market shook that hard and VIX fly that hard. In my mind, I'm like, well,
862.06s: I just I struggled to believe that institutions were caught that far off sides. But like, so what
869.02s: causes that from an underlying market perspective? You can probably understand this even better than I
874.46s: can being a trader. It's all about positioning. In short term sentiment. In short term positioning too.
881.82s: I mean, they're they're going in with and traders are by definition more fickle, right? You know,
888.62s: they're they can have one opinion one day and a totally different opinion next day, whereas
894.14s: my opinions haven't changed much in two years, you know, so or maybe five years. But so it's a lot
903.18s: of it is they're looking they're parsing every word. They're looking at everything for any potential
909.26s: change and whether any of them want to admit it or not, they're driven by the tape. So if he had
916.94s: said the same thing and the tape had gone the other way, that wouldn't have been anything they would
923.90s: look at it. It's the combination of their positioning and what then soon begins to happen at the
930.22s: margin. If it starts, then they say, Oh, yeah, his rhetoric seemingly is indicating we might be
936.06s: done with cuts for a while. I got to get out, you know, and and then once you drove yield so fast,
943.18s: it's booked the market. I see. Interesting. Now, another thing I noticed with like near term positioning
949.98s: to to follow along on that and continue putting you out of your comfort zone talking about short term
955.42s: stuff. I find it so interesting that it seems like the market is digesting any sort of inflation
962.78s: level data. And it seems like it's like high-percentive to the downside. But it's not really showing
969.74s: that to the upside, right? Like when we got the the slightly lighter CPI yesterday, the market went up,
976.06s: but it's not like flying up. Whereas it seems like if that came in a little hot, the probability
981.50s: of my mind is that the market was probably going to show up a pretty big hand to the downside.
986.22s: So what do you think about like that general function right now as it sits? Yeah, that's good insight
991.90s: because I do think it's indicative of the nervousness that's still built into this market. It
999.02s: confirms for me. It's certainly not, you know, it's not where I spend most of my, I mean,
1004.78s: sentiment's important to me, but I don't spend a lot of time trying to analyze a day to day.
1011.10s: But it certainly it does kind of confirm for me that people are still one foot out one like
1020.86s: out the door. You know, they are they are more comforted by the market having shown resilience.
1027.74s: And they may talk a good game about having higher numbers, you know, higher targets,
1034.46s: but they're scared to sell. They're wrong. You know, it's not all the minute.
1039.50s: And for you know, maybe I'm not, you know, I don't want to overstate this, but I was talking about
1046.06s: a global bust, you know, five or six years ago saying nothing it would happen right then, although
1052.78s: could have happened a lot sooner than I, we are now, but, but I always said, you know, we'll have
1057.74s: a meltup in that a global bust that I defined that bust long ago. And now you see a lot more people
1063.34s: using the term bust that never did before. Some misusing it, but some using it like I'm intending
1069.98s: that it's bigger than, you know, much bigger in the normal recession. I think I plan to see
1076.78s: in a lot of people's heads and then others that may be saying the same thing now or doing too,
1082.70s: that there's this fear in the market. Unlike, you know, going into lots of our recessions,
1089.34s: they don't, you know, we don't go into every recession, say, oh my god, the market's going to,
1093.50s: you know, the economy's going to blow up bigger than the entire blow. This is unusual. You know,
1097.98s: we had it in 2008-09, so that's part of it is we have that pressure in mind, but it's also
1103.82s: because of the setup, because of the massive leverage, you know, my forecast has been out there
1109.26s: for a long time, that this isn't going to be an ordinary downturn. When it goes, we can have
1115.74s: the biggest financial crisis in history, we can have something, you know, is one way to put it,
1120.62s: we can have something bigger in 2008-09, which is another way to put it. And then I, a company that,
1126.14s: by saying, we could see an 80% bear market bigger since 1929. Those things are out there,
1133.02s: and again, I'm not trying to take credit for everything and say, well, I'm the only one thinking
1136.54s: that way, but I was the first in terms of thinking in those kind of exaggerated terms,
1143.42s: who saw this cycle in those kind of terms. I do think that's in a lot more both institutional
1151.34s: retail minds than in previous cycles, that it's not only are we rolling over, are we going into
1158.46s: a bear market? It's their scared to death, that this could be the big one, you know, and there
1164.22s: may be other reasons they are scared of that, too, such as my, you know, the view I put forth, but
1170.62s: but I do think that's in the, whether it's me or other things. I think in the back of an awful lot
1175.98s: of institutional investor minds is when this goes, it's going to, it's going to come at us very fast,
1182.86s: and it's going to be very steep. So they don't want to be late. There is this real fear of being late,
1188.78s: more so than in most cycles. I see. And given that fear and then the implication then
1197.02s: for kind of near term positioning, how does that then lead into the melt up? Because typically,
1204.94s: when I think of the, the actual melt up portion of this where things start to get more
1210.14s: parabolic in nature at some point, I continue to go back to like, I'm curious what the catalyst
1215.50s: then would be. And it looks like the next Fed rate cut isn't really priced in until the summer.
1221.42s: It's like June, and it's only like just over 50%. So it's real, real light at this point. So then
1226.78s: I'm thinking that's coming up, but not until summer. So then does that impact the timeline that
1234.14s: you would expect for this melt up? Or is there another catalyst that could contribute here?
1239.50s: Could be in other cows, but I don't even think it's another catalyst. I think that's, that's,
1244.06s: that's the narrative today that can change to the narrative that causes us to go.
1248.46s: In other words, if people are, if people are now convinced that there's no cuts coming for six
1253.42s: months. And if we get a week, and we start, get manufacturing, certainly, we got a very week,
1263.42s: you know, the most recent New York reading on, you know, manufacturing and X.
1268.62s: The manufacturing was very week, right? If we start seeing week data, you know, ISM has
1277.10s: still been negative most time. It was a little stronger recently. But if we start getting
1282.22s: negative data again, people are right back on the side of a narrative that says,
1286.30s: we can con me and if inflation, I'm here again. Again, I don't know this, but I saw something today
1293.34s: where PC, PCE and people can take CPI, PPI, I don't do it. But somebody can just
1302.22s: claim they can pretty much give you what PCE will be. And there's numbers out there of
1307.34s: something under 2%. You know, maybe well under 2%. I've seen 1.9, I've seen even lower.
1315.90s: If that, if people get convinced that inflation is not taking up, but actually still trending down,
1323.74s: and if the economy, you know, data points start showing, data releases start showing,
1329.82s: economy is slowing more. I think you'll be right back in the narrative of, you know,
1336.30s: we could have three or four cuts this year. You know, they'll start with, I see. It'll start with,
1341.18s: you know, yeah, those two cuts look pretty, pretty, you know, I'm confident it took
1346.78s: cuts again instead of what, you know, they're starting to be talking about no cuts, you know, or even
1352.62s: people, even though they don't think it's high probability, talking about the possibility of
1356.38s: raising again. I think that's not going to happen. I think we're likely to get four cuts this year.
1362.70s: I don't even know. Number of cuts to me is, you know, a game. I don't worry about that, but it is,
1368.94s: it is part of measuring a narrative, which, you know, where it's a narrative, two cuts
1373.58s: of the four, whatever, but, but personally, I think the bigger story is going to be that this economy
1379.82s: is going to slow faster than people expect. Maybe, maybe, maybe in recession much sooner than people
1385.34s: expect. And then from there, you know, see even worse thing from that. And, and the inflation is
1392.70s: actually, we may be finally getting to the point where, because shelter was a, a net, help this,
1399.90s: this time around in terms of inflation lower, I think came in below expectations. We may be finally
1405.74s: at that point where shelter starts calling. It starts, you know, recognizing the weakness in
1410.94s: shelter, because it was such a lag or it was for a long time, it was kind of propping up numbers.
1416.70s: So I think we may be at that point where you get the opposite where shelter is actually
1421.02s: contributing to the weakness in CPI and, you know, inflation. And, you know, I think
1429.34s: you're going to, you're going to have to, in other words, it's almost like you're going to have to
1432.14s: win that your back for the markets if numbers are starting to come in below expectations.
1439.74s: Really interesting. So it's almost like the bad news becomes good news in a way.
1445.58s: Absolutely. I have said for a long time, I think the much more likely way we get to a top
1451.66s: is weakness in the economy, not strength. You know, I think, I think the likelihood is that the
1460.86s: the narrative that we have as we move to the top is going to be weak software economy. I don't,
1467.82s: I don't mean it's bust, but software economy, maybe even recession nearby, lower inflation
1477.10s: and fed ease. You know, fed is back on the ease story. And in fact, maybe the fed has to catch up now.
1484.38s: You know, because they still are behind curve terms tightening. And people don't, I don't even
1489.58s: talk about it a lot because it hasn't happened yet. But we keep talking about fed ease in terms of
1495.90s: rates. And this is as long as I filed the Fed, which is 50 years, that has been part of how Wall Street
1504.14s: sees things. True ease is the money supply is the fed's balance sheet. The fed's been tightening.
1511.66s: Even now, they've been tricking in the balance sheet. So, you know, true ease is when
1518.54s: they're printing money, when they're expanding their balance sheet again, we're not, we're not
1523.42s: seeing that at all. So the fed is still tight and tightening. And yes, rates have come down,
1529.90s: but that's not ease, although, you know, in Wall Street language it's ease, but it's really,
1537.58s: the rates are following the market down. What do you make of the relationship still between
1544.46s: small cap and large cap? I thought it was noteworthy seeing the Russell contract as heavily as it
1551.50s: did in December. And as compared to things like large cap, which has started at least a little bit,
1557.34s: maybe it's just a relief rally because it still looks like it's in a downtrend again from a
1560.62s: trader's perspective. But small cap has kind of just been hover in sideways here. So I thought the
1566.86s: weakness there was just generally noteworthy. Do you make anything of that? I think it is not
1571.66s: worthy. It's more of the same in terms of what I said before about kind of how positioning
1580.54s: leads to what you get leads to a correction. I think so many people finally jumped on,
1588.30s: you know, so many people fought the Russell for a long time and said the Russell's, you know,
1594.22s: dog poop, you know, it looks, yeah, it looks like it's never going to go again. And I had those
1599.18s: questions on Twitter forever. And then it all was in lift to the tent and had that big run,
1605.90s: you know, I'd performed in the summer. And then I went sleep, underperformed all the way into the
1611.58s: election, I think. And then and then I had that run after the election where it double-topped. I
1619.02s: went to it back to its all-time highs. And then and then kind of topped out in early December. And like,
1625.34s: say, corrected 10 or 11 percent much more than the other indexes. I think that was because that run
1635.10s: first in the summer. And then the second one into early December had people jumping on the
1642.06s: bandwagon saying, yeah, small caps are coming alive. Yes, small cap. And you heard you heard on,
1647.66s: you know, if you listen to CNBC or anywhere you heard portfolio managers coming out talking up,
1654.30s: small caps saying, yeah, I think the markets, which I've been saying for a while, the market was
1659.18s: going to broaden out. But you had more and more people saying, yeah, with Trump coming in, it's
1663.42s: going to be, you know, better for the economy and better for the domestics and that really
1669.26s: favors small cap and all that. So so you had kind of bullishness rise up for the for the increase
1679.82s: for the Russell. And it just meant it's time it's time to put those people in their place and get
1685.58s: that wall of worry back up because everybody's jumped on that bullish small cap bandwagon. And that's
1691.26s: that's what I think it took was a bigger correction. And then I mean, I saw in the last couple weeks,
1698.14s: the Russell's awful. Well, how can you tell me the Russell's going to 3300? There's no way.
1703.74s: You know, that's that that index should be, you know, taken out and buried. You know, they really
1709.90s: were getting upset with it because it obviously had disappointed them. So I see this as nothing
1716.46s: other than that. It's more the the game was sentiment positioning. And now it's starting to come out
1723.26s: of that wall, you know, three or four days ago at bottom. It came right down to the 200 day moving
1729.58s: average on Monday, I think. And third. And I think we've seen the bottom. And I think, you know,
1738.06s: I think 3300 is likely. So it got below 2200, but found a 2160, I think, 2160 70.
1746.38s: Yeah. Yeah. 2160 70. So 3300, 2200, the 13 was 300 and 50%. So from there was basically a little
1757.50s: more than 50%. That's what I think in this parabolic, that's what you're going to get. If you can get
1763.58s: 50% if the parabolic truly is first half of this year, whether it's three months, four months,
1769.98s: five months, I don't know. But if you get that and you get a 50% move in the Russell in that time frame,
1777.02s: that's that's pretty historic, I think. Yeah. Well, especially if I think again, going back to
1783.82s: your broader comments around what would drive this? Because it seems like we would need to see
1790.14s: economic data starting to show weakness. Is that the main thing that you would see for the
1794.46s: Russell specifically? Or does it follow the broader narrative that you're talking about before?
1799.10s: Yeah, it's basically for the whole market. I think I think you're going to have lower interest rates,
1804.62s: weaker dollar. And of course, the Russell is also more financials. I think they will benefit
1811.90s: from all of that. And so we'll domestic and I talk less about it because it's not really the macro
1820.86s: story, but having Trump come in as of next Monday and pushing a pro capitalists, pro US policy
1830.54s: is very much very much favors the Russell. I see. Literally a beautiful segue too. So we saw an
1840.70s: initial rally, obviously, when Trump won the election itself. Do you think that there's going to be
1847.98s: a sympathetic follow-up through when he actually takes office? Or do you think a lot of that stuff's
1852.46s: already been priced in based on the stuff he's been talking about? His policy expectations and
1857.66s: stuff like that. I don't think it's priced in because I think everybody kind of got distracted by
1862.70s: the yield curve. With rates moving up and the dollar moving up, people kind of got caught up in
1869.02s: the various side of the story. So I think you had that initials per right after the election when he won
1877.42s: and then really in a little bit more into December, but then after that it's been all negative. So
1884.46s: not because of him so much, but more focus on, well, there is a narrative that has been a negative
1892.54s: narrative for Trump and that regarding Trump. That was the idea that tariffs are inflationary.
1901.02s: The idea that his policies, CBO and various Wall Street economists are all pushing this idea that
1910.94s: he, you know, relevant happened before the election or against it back then, but that his policies were
1919.58s: more inflationary and would cause higher deficits than Kamala's would and certainly more in Biden's.
1929.42s: And I disagree with all of that. The problem is that most of those that score these policies hate
1938.38s: supply side economics don't believe in supply side economics. Do all of this stuff in a static model,
1944.22s: meaning they don't give you any credit for lower tax rates leading to higher growth and higher
1951.42s: growth leading to higher tax revenues. It's been proven. It was proven in the Reagan tax cuts.
1956.78s: It was proven in the first Trump tax cuts. When you do large tax cuts across the board like they did,
1963.18s: it does boost the economy. All things being equal. The problem is, you know, at the end of the Trump
1970.30s: administration, all things were equal. We had a pandemic. And so, you know, we had the early stages
1977.34s: of having the prime pump and push all kinds of new fiscal money out the door. So it kind of short
1984.70s: circuited what would have been growing revenues and lower spending or not, you know, not bigger spending.
1992.14s: But the problem in deficits is spending. Our problem is not tax cuts. If you cut taxes,
1997.90s: you're going to get higher revenues. And so, but partially because they don't believe in them,
2004.62s: partially because they don't, you know, partially because I think a lot of these people scoring have
2009.90s: TDS. You know, I think the combination of those two things, you end up with assumptions that are,
2017.66s: I think, very faulty. And so my belief is, is policies will not lead to higher inflation,
2025.34s: will not lead to bigger deficits. That all being said, you know, my forecast, which is that we
2031.42s: are going to have much higher inflation after the bust because of the, you know, the massive money
2038.54s: that gets put into the system, not just here, but around the globe. But that's not because of
2043.90s: Trump policy. So, so the initial response, I think, once you get selected, is that you are going
2051.98s: to get another, you know, big boost to the market. Do you think the conversations he's having around
2059.74s: increasing tariffs with big trade partners like Canada, Mexico, also him trying to increase
2069.66s: just domestic production because you know all this way better than I do. But my expectation of
2077.34s: some of those policies, depending on how they're implemented, in my mind, I was expecting
2082.30s: short term pain that might lead to longer term relief. But it sounds like you're thinking when
2089.82s: you're talking about not being super inflationary. What, what timeframe is, are you using for that?
2096.22s: And then do you see any short term issues based on some of those policies that would then
2101.82s: alleviate longer term? Do you think that there would be essentially none right out of the gate?
2106.30s: Yeah. So, so I have to talk about reality versus, you know, what, what I think will happen in the
2112.86s: real world versus what I think the narrative is going to be. So in other words, under my bust forecast,
2121.58s: it's not a given, it's my forecast, right? Where I say we're going to have the biggest
2127.18s: downturn in the post-war or two era, we're going to have the biggest financial crisis, maybe ever,
2133.58s: globally. And leading to maybe 20 trillion in Fed expansion. And likewise, proportionally around the
2143.50s: world, that jump starts in inflation cycle like no other. You know, we'll see a, we'll see 25 in my
2149.90s: opinion, I've said this to you before, we'll see 25% inflation by early next decade if I'm right
2155.74s: about that. So I'm not saying Trump isn't going to be living, you know, that we're not going to be
2163.10s: seeing inflation in the balance of this decade. I think we're going to see deflation first.
2168.86s: And the response to that deflation is going to cause inflation. But that's, that's a macro story that
2176.06s: that's a thing to do with Trump's policies. So, and we don't know that that's going to happen yet.
2182.22s: And if we're going into a period where we're going to have more, you fork stage where everybody's
2187.82s: excited that Trump's policies are more pro capitalists, more pro growth, inflation's coming down,
2196.22s: the narrative of the next six months is likely to be very bullish. So they're not going to be,
2203.42s: they're not going to be focused on, because it won't even be evident at that time, they're not
2207.66s: going to be focused on a global bus and a response to the bus is going to be a stationary. If,
2216.54s: things start popping up that say global bus, the focus will be deflation, right? Not inflation.
2222.70s: I, I, you know, step ahead and talk about what happens in terms of response and things.
2229.02s: That's not how the street works. You know, the street's going to be focused first,
2233.50s: after inauguration on Trump's policies and those being positive for growth and bullish for
2242.86s: the stock market. And then if they start seeing signs of bus, they're focused on deflation,
2251.90s: which means even lower rates, which even means even more fed ease, right? So there's a period here
2259.02s: for the next three to six months and I don't know what it's three four five six, where I think
2265.98s: most of the narrative is going to be towards lower rates, lower dollar, lower growth,
2272.70s: lower inflation, higher, much higher stocks. Somewhere in there, whether it be April, May, June,
2283.50s: I think it will, will be in a euphoric period where it will be who's people to start looking past
2290.78s: that euphoria to the fact that there are, there are storm clouds on the horizon that could come
2300.30s: pretty fast, meaning Europe started to look like dog poop, you know, Canada's in trouble economically,
2310.78s: Asia's, you know, China's struggling, etc. Those kind of things could be out there by mid-year
2319.02s: and maybe our economies, you know, moved into recession. And as I say, the reason I'm
2326.30s: going for a bus is because we've got massive leverage on that system, much bigger than 2008-09.
2333.58s: That's really the story of why it turns a recession, you know, an ordinary recession, it's simply worse.
2340.62s: But the first step is to get into that recession.
2344.22s: I see. Now, speaking of different policy changes and expectations, what are your thoughts around
2352.14s: energy and metals, what they might look like, kind of decoupled from the melt-up and bust itself,
2359.50s: which is kind of talking about the performance expectations of energy and metals given the policies
2366.46s: expectations, and then obviously we can mold them together with how they interact with the melt-up and
2371.10s: bust. So let's start with oil. Oil's had this run from, you know, the mid-60s to the high-70s
2378.38s: and the less, I don't know what, a couple months. I think that run should be over or very close to over.
2387.10s: It ticked down today, but who knows. I'm still in the belief that we're heading for 60.
2393.98s: It's not unusual to have a run. You know, we came down from 130 back in 22, came all the way down to
2401.50s: the 60s and then back up into the 80s, mid-80s, I think. And then back down to the mid-60s again and
2410.38s: now up to the high-70s, I think it's part of that stair step, you know, it plays out over many
2416.78s: months, but it's what I think is going on. I think the next step is another run down to even lower
2423.42s: lows than the mid-60s. So probably, you know, 60 or high-50s and that coincides with the economy
2430.46s: getting softer as we move towards mid-year. Again, the next set of data points I'm not trying to
2437.26s: tell you happens in the next two weeks, you know, or three weeks or four weeks, but over the course
2442.22s: of this first half of this year, I think we're going to see a softer economy lower demand. And of
2447.34s: course, where it was, Germany's in negative GDP now, China's in deflation now. So you're going
2455.26s: to see where it went demand for oil, I think, continues to slip. At the same time, Trump's coming in
2462.78s: and talking about, you know, drill-by-be drill right from day one. So how fast that all plays out,
2471.26s: I think it's in the narrative right away, that oil supply is going up and my belief is oil
2479.50s: demand is coming, I'm going to continue to soften that leads to weaker prices. So that's what I
2486.22s: think the next several months is. And then I've said in the bus, if I'm right, the bus happens
2491.98s: later this year in the bus next, but oiled with a $30. So I think we've pretty much seen the
2498.14s: high water mark or close to the high water mark in oil. You know, watch it next week go to 85.
2504.30s: But I think we're in the last stages of any strength in oil. And I think it just begins a downtrend
2512.86s: from there. Before we go into metals for the oil component just at a curiosity, do you think
2521.02s: softening demand would then lead to production slowing? Or do you think that we would start
2527.02s: storing, I'm just wondering how those two different things come together?
2532.22s: Well, yeah, my guess is, and I don't know this obviously, but my guess is Trump's
2538.30s: other mind to get oil up, right? He's not saying, he's not trying to predict the oil price in the
2544.14s: next six months. He's just looking and saying, yeah, if I were president the last four years,
2549.02s: we would have had even more supply and we got to get oil up. And he's focused really on us being
2555.26s: totally independent of supply coming in from our adversaries or anybody that we are self-sufficient
2564.22s: in oil. So he's looking at it as lower oil prices, lower gasping prices, helps the economy,
2571.74s: helps the consumer. Higher oil production helps Pennsylvania helps oil companies, etc. So I think
2581.58s: he's not going to be all focused on what's the price of oil going to be in the next six months. So
2587.02s: so I think the likelihood is at least for the next several months, he's going to be encouraging
2593.42s: more drilling. Now what the oil companies do in terms of their focus, they may be a little more
2599.10s: focused on, you know, we want to hold back some of that supply because, you know, the market's weakening.
2605.02s: So it's not, you know, his policy may not go one-for-one right into a big increase in supply because
2610.86s: it's got to be done by the companies themselves. But I think in general, the narrative of the next
2617.02s: six months is going to be towards higher supply or towards, you know, more drilling. I see, got it. Okay,
2623.26s: cool. Yeah, thank you for the clarification there. And I know we're coming up on time here, but
2627.98s: there's just a couple of other things I wanted to run by you. Definitely. Well, he did ask about
2631.42s: the metals if you want. I was going to ask if we could cover metals, yeah. Yeah, that's kind of key.
2636.14s: I think the metals look great here. You know, silver, the first one, gold. I mean, gold is coming out
2643.50s: of a consolidation of the last several months where if you look, particularly if you're looking at
2648.38s: them monthly, you know, kind of came into a wedge, technically, and it's breaking out of that wedge,
2654.38s: as we speak. So we're not far from highs. I think we'll push through the old high, you know,
2660.94s: last year. And, you know, my target is 3,400. And I think I'm very comfortable with 3,400. If it
2667.98s: exceeds 3,400, it won't surprise me. And that's, again, first half of this year, probably,
2676.46s: could spill over from there. But I think it's most of its first half. Silver has been the laggard of
2683.82s: the two, particularly the miners of silver. But I think silver is also showing it's coming out of
2693.82s: consolidation. You know, it got up to 35 and a half. I think it's, you know, run early
2701.34s: on last year, whatever towards the end of last year. And it's corrected down to, you know,
2708.46s: bulk up just below 30. And now trying to turn around and get going here, I think we'll be back
2714.54s: above 35 pretty quickly. I don't know whether it happens in, you know, the next month or takes two
2720.38s: months. But my guess is it's the next month. And on its way to the mid 40s. And then from the mid 40s,
2727.26s: I have a target 75. So again, it's coming from farther back. So it might take longer
2735.18s: in terms of it may take more than six months, but it can also get going fast. It could be,
2740.46s: most of them could happen in the next six months. So that's a hell of a move. If we go from 30 here,
2746.70s: or 3031 here to 75, and that's kind of what I expect. By the way, the gold silver ratio,
2756.78s: which had rolled over last year because silver did pretty well for a while. And gold that,
2763.66s: you know, could tolerate some of their run. Silver just goes faster when it goes. It's
2768.78s: percentage wise, most faster. So in the bull run, we had brought the gold silver ratio down from
2775.02s: 80 or 85, 90. I don't remember where it topped out there. And then it turned around here in this
2782.46s: most recent correction because silver corrected more and went back towards the high of that ratio.
2789.42s: I'm, you know, if you divide 3,400 by 75, I think it takes you down towards 40.
2799.10s: Yeah, I think it takes you down towards 40, 45, something like that on the ratio from up over 80 or 85.
2805.98s: So what that means is as that ratio drops that favor silver, means silver is up performing gold.
2814.06s: And that's exactly what you get in bull markets in the metals. So I expect that the miners themselves,
2819.98s: which have lagged by a lot, I think it's just a matter of people need to gain confidence that
2825.90s: this isn't going to be another one of those failed rallies in the metals, you know, they go and then
2830.78s: they stop particularly silver. You know, they look like they're lifting out of a consolidation and they
2836.22s: stop it correct again. And I think that's just discouraged the miner investors. And so they're
2845.10s: more shown the investors. You know, it's like they're they're going to come in later. They're just not
2849.26s: going to jump on the bandwagon so quickly. Do you think crypto currency or Bitcoin has any
2856.14s: interaction in this conversation with the performance of gold and silver? I know a lot of people have
2861.58s: mixed feelings. I know there's like the metal diehards that, you know, no interaction. I think there's
2867.18s: some people that are thinking Bitcoin is going to overtake it at some point in terms of being a
2871.42s: currency or just a preservation of value just really, really curious if you think that crypto currency
2879.18s: Bitcoin fits into this in any way. Yeah, I'm not saying we didn't lose some investors that used to be
2884.70s: traditional metals investors to Bitcoin. I'm sure there are people think it's, you know,
2890.94s: it's digital gold or whatever. Right. So I'm not saying that hasn't happened at the micro level
2898.62s: on a macro basis. What we're seeing in gold and silver is gold and silver's own problems, you
2903.10s: know, or particularly silver own problems. It's not. I think Bitcoin has little to do with any of it.
2909.42s: And I'm not going to hold back gold and silver now or post bust. You know, my target on gold is
2918.46s: 20,000 by early next decade. My target on silver is 500. So clearly I'm not thinking Bitcoin's an
2927.50s: issue. And I don't know what Bitcoin isn't that. You know, maybe it flies to or maybe it doesn't go.
2934.14s: I, you know, it could be, you know, I have no opinion of what Bitcoin's going to look like after the
2939.26s: bust or frankly, it's got to prove itself in the bus before you kind of have any idea what's going
2945.10s: to look like what it does. Yeah. Yeah. Awesome. One last question before I let you run. The
2952.78s: when I think about a lot of the technology that's coming out, there's expansion of artificial
2959.10s: intelligence, general robotics, we're now starting to talk about quantum computing, although that
2963.90s: still seems like it's a bit of a ways done done the path here. Do you think from a commodities,
2970.86s: metals, perspective that there could be some sort of larger production of some of the materials
2978.06s: that ultimately feed into those broader systems? So things like lithium, for example, kind of going
2984.06s: to like the battery side of things, just thinking that from a commodities perspective, if there's
2989.66s: going to be this really big technological revolution, it needs to be supported by, you know, an
2996.62s: underlying hardware infrastructure of some sort. Do you see any specific commodities, anything
3002.46s: like that that is more friendly, more likely poised to benefit from that movement?
3008.22s: Yeah, for sure. I think a silver is a good one that being solder obviously in the EV,
3013.02s: in solar panels, in lots of technology areas, it's increasing the need for silver and the
3021.98s: demand for silver. So I think yes, lithium, silver, some of those metals are going to see increase
3028.94s: demand because of technology. And we're going to obviously see increased power needs because of
3034.62s: technology. So, you know, benefits oil later on down the road. So yeah, I think for sure,
3043.90s: on the other hand, what I would say, this isn't really a question, but post-bust, if the environment is
3051.10s: what I think it's going to be, which is unlike the last 42 years where interest rates
3056.86s: ratchet it down from 15 or 20% down to almost zero, the next cycle post-bust, they're going to
3065.98s: ratchet up from zero to 20% higher. That is not an environment for growth stocks. So
3075.66s: there will be growth stocks that can outpace that kind of move in interest rates and the effect
3081.50s: has on PE multiples, etc. There'll be things probably in the AI field and maybe quantum physics,
3088.22s: etc. But generally, whereas growth was the name of the game for many, you know, for less
3097.02s: several decades, the name of the game in the next cycle post-bust is going to be resources.
3104.46s: It's going to be commodities because there's going to be a real scarcity, partly for what you
3110.46s: just asked about, you know, that feeds into that same thing where demand is going to far outstrip
3115.66s: supply. And there's only one way for prices to go if demand outstrip supply by the amount
3122.38s: it's going to, and that's straight up. Got it. Okay. One last question I promised I lied to you
3129.34s: before. I was just thinking about the scissors talking. Nuclear energy. Do you think that that
3135.10s: starts to take a larger role in providing energy at this point? Do you think that there's a
3141.58s: feeder opportunity there? I think so. I mean, you definitely have improved the technology and
3147.98s: they've rethought it. So it's no longer these greenfield plants that take 15 years in the planning.
3154.86s: And so the supply comes online 20 years from now or 18 years from now. And it's not realistic.
3162.06s: So now you have these smaller nuclear plants that can be built pretty quickly and you know,
3169.26s: don't have to cross so many regulatory hurdles. And I think that's the way to go.
3176.86s: So for sure, we're going to have a shortage of energy. There's no question.
3181.26s: That's just like commodities. Energy is going to be a commodity that demands far outstripping
3187.18s: supply. You know, we've constrained supply in all those areas in energy and all our commodities.
3194.06s: And then all of a sudden you have this huge, massive fiscal is in monetary pump stimulus.
3205.66s: 20 trillion from our fed, something 15 or 20 trillion from our government in terms of new fiscal
3213.58s: all that. And the same thing going around around the world, you're just going to have this huge
3218.86s: spike in demand for things. You know, here it's going to be the story's going to be we're
3223.90s: reshoring, we're building a plan equipment. You know, we're bringing our capacity back on
3229.42s: shore. And that demands a lot of commodities elsewhere. There's going to be stories around the
3234.86s: world. Why? Why? There's a need for all these resources. But the story is that there's going to
3241.74s: be this massive demand. And energy is definitely one of them. You know, electricity is definitely
3248.62s: one of them. So I think, and I also think the next four years, we're going to be much more
3255.02s: common sense call about how do we develop this energy? This is not going to be windmills.
3265.02s: You know, it's not going to be, you know, some solar, it's not that those things are going away.
3270.22s: But I think Trump is going to be much more about, yeah, we need to go where we can get the
3275.74s: biggest bang for our buck and where it makes much more sense economically. And that's nuclear.
3282.70s: As well as you're going to continue to see fossil fuels. And they're not going away. They're going
3287.42s: the other way. I think the next, you know, between now and the end of the decade, fossil fuels are
3292.30s: going to be expanding big time, not shrinking. Makes it fun of sense. If we had a different
3298.70s: president, and that wouldn't be the story, but under Trump, that's where we're headed.
3305.42s: David is always, it is absolutely awesome to connect with you to pick your brain a little bit. I've
3310.86s: just grabbed in your x page, which is Dave H. Contrarian. I will throw a link in the description
3318.22s: below for everybody that wants to look you up there. You have your newsletter. Still, I presume
3321.74s: they can DM you to find out more about that. Is there no more else? No, that's pretty much it. The
3327.74s: letter is a quarterly letter. My first quarter letter just went out. And it is by subscription.
3334.06s: So yeah, they can DM me for any information if they're interested. Let me just say I've set
3339.18s: it before I think on your channel. And I saw it again this week. I very rarely do other than these
3347.10s: YouTube's. I very rarely do where I do my own post to let people know that there's new new
3354.30s: interview out, but other than that, I rarely do, rarely initiate posts. Most of my activity on
3363.74s: X is replying to other people. Now I may reply to other people 30 or 40 times in a day, and sometimes,
3371.26s: you know, a dozen times, but mostly I'm on there doing a dozen or more replies, sometimes much more.
3377.90s: And then I put out an individual, you know, I initiated a post like I did. I think yesterday
3385.42s: saying I think there's a big reversal here in the stock market, bond market, the metals market,
3393.82s: and the currency markets that were they're all coming together right now to begin big
3398.94s: reversals in whichever direction they were, you know, up to where they've been going. I put that out
3405.42s: and it never fails. I get a few posts from people, replies from people going either where have you
3413.90s: been or it's nice to see you post again after such a long time. And I'll go on mon here every day,
3420.06s: actively on here every day. So what that means is people, and I'm not a Twitter expert,
3427.18s: an expert, but I have learned at least this much. There are settings you have to go to and make
3434.06s: sure you're set to get notifications of my replies. If you're just set up to get my initiated
3441.58s: post, you're not going to see hardly any activity. So for a lot of people, you're missing
3448.70s: thousands of posts if not tens of thousands of posts from me because your settings are not set
3453.74s: up to see the replies. And that's where my replies are really where I educate where I use a
3459.98s: reply to an individual to basically make a point, a broader point general audience, not always to that
3468.94s: individual. So yeah, thanks for letting them know they can definitely go to your profile on there.
3474.06s: They'll see that there's a little bell. And if they click the bell, they can be alerted to
3478.70s: pretty much all your posts. So and if you can't figure out how to do that, I mean, they just need
3482.46s: to go to Google because it's pretty. But thanks for, you know, you can't make it. I didn't even know that.
3488.22s: That's yeah, yeah, it's all good. So but as always, absolutely awesome connecting. I'll connect with
3493.98s: you offline to set up another time to talk in a few months and see, uh, see how things progress.
3499.26s: I am eager, eager to know what, what ends up happening from here. Yeah, I think we're in for a few
3504.14s: months of fun here. So enjoy it. Awesome. Yeah. Thanks, Eric.
