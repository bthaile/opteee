0.00s:  What's up everyone? Welcome back to the Outlier podcast. I have my friend, Shay from Humboldt
7.36s:  Trader. I'll throw a link to all of her stuff in the description below, but we're reconnecting
13.28s:  because I was out visiting her in Vancouver a couple months ago for a podcast and really
18.20s:  enjoyed the conversation. And I think your approach to markets from what I can tell is
23.84s:  really interesting. One of the things I try to do with my podcast is to put different
28.40s:  approaches in front of people because one of my stances on trading is such a big component
33.84s:  of it is finding something that aligns with you and like your personality and like what
38.48s:  makes sense for the way you think about the world and markets. And I think you offer a really
42.80s:  cool perspective. So thanks for coming to hang out. Thanks for having me, Eric. It's an honor
47.12s:  to be on your podcast. It's a blast. So first of all, I have to ask when the summer kept
56.40s:  running out there, when I was in Vancouver, it was gorgeous. Is it still like that or does
61.84s:  it start getting like super humid and stuff? It's it's gotten hotter now. But it's doesn't
69.68s:  ever get humid here. It's really dry here on the west coast. So it's actually really,
74.48s:  really nice out like if you like the beach, if you like a beach weather, like that's this
78.56s:  like a perfect time in Vancouver. Oh, that's awesome. Yeah, when I was out there, I was so stoked
83.20s:  with the weather and I was curious if it starts heating up a ton. So speaking of heating up,
88.72s:  I you primarily trade small caps or not necessarily like penny stocks or anything like that,
93.44s:  but not not large cap. You're primarily like day trading small cap stocks. Is that correct?
98.16s:  Actually, in the recent years, I trade more of the mid caps and larger cap stocks.
104.16s:  And then I'll dabble into the small caps when I see really good opportunities. Maybe like
109.84s:  a couple of times a month. Got it. And just for my understanding, how do you define mid cap?
115.92s:  What market cap falls into there? Well, I kind of categorize large cap, mid cap, all together.
120.80s:  Anything over a billion market cap, I kind of trade them a certain way. And then anything
125.20s:  under I trade it as just small caps. Got it. Yeah. Then I see how you're breaking it down there.
130.72s:  And so what do you make of the recent market activity? We've been selling off for a couple
136.00s:  days now. How does that impact your approach? Yeah. So this year, at least for me, what's
143.84s:  being working really well for me has just been going long on the large cap stocks. So when the
148.96s:  markets are selling off, honestly, they should be told it's hard for me to find setups I really
154.32s:  want to trade. So the last couple of days, I just kind of been sitting on the sidelines, I scalped
159.92s:  here and there really, really short term. But I'm honestly just like, you know, looking and
166.72s:  looking and waiting for the right opportunities to get back in. So when the market sells off,
172.24s:  I'm just kind of on the sidelines. I don't really short sell large caps that much this year.
178.24s:  I got them burnt in the beginning of the year. So that's why even though we have short term
182.88s:  pullback, like right now, I'm still just, you know, re-empatients and waiting for the right opportunities.
188.80s:  Got it. Yeah. And another question I had with your approach specifically is,
195.04s:  what's your methodology for identifying like these market turnovers? Because I imagine you trade
202.48s:  typically shorter term time frames. So that's one of the benefits, you know, perceivably in terms of
209.36s:  the purpose of day trading, you're supposed to be able to catch these kinds of capitulations.
212.96s:  What's your approach to doing that? Yeah. So, like you said, the benefit is overnight, we don't have
219.12s:  any exposure, unless I'm doing some swing trading. But most of the time I'm day trading and,
224.40s:  you know, overnight, I don't really have to worry about anything. So if I wake up, I see everything's
229.44s:  gapping down, you know, continuing to sell off like the last two days, I would look at things and
235.92s:  wait for maybe two hours to see if there's a reversal to get in. But if not, then, you know,
242.96s:  it doesn't really affect me. So that's one of the benefits of day trading. I don't really have
247.76s:  to time anything. I see. Yeah. Yeah. The reason why I kind of dove straight into methodology from the
254.56s:  jump is just because I thought the market activity's been interesting. And I want to dive more into the
259.28s:  way you think about it later. But to take us a couple steps back now, I would love to understand
266.48s:  the way that you entered markets. Because when you and I spoke, you'd mention that you've tried a
272.40s:  few different things. And even now you've mentioned that you've tried a few different things. So
276.64s:  walk me through when you started trading and then kind of a evolution after that.
284.48s:  Yeah. I went first kind of learned about what trading is was 10 years ago. I went first
291.20s:  graduated from college. And in the beginning, you know, I just wanted like fast money, right? I
297.28s:  saw the ads for penny stocks. So back then, my first introduction was like OTC stocks, penny stocks.
304.64s:  And we're talking about the stocks are literally two or three cents. So that's my very beginning. I was
310.56s:  trying to buy pump and dumps and then eventually learn to short sell the pump and dump stocks.
317.28s:  So that's kind of my first introduction. And then gradually, I realized that, you know, small caps
323.20s:  and penny stocks, they're kind of extremely cyclical. Stock market is cyclical in nature,
328.32s:  but for the smaller cap stocks, even more so. Sometimes the cycles can rotate really fast in the
334.56s:  matter of a couple of days or even weeks. So at least in the very beginning, I was a trader,
341.44s:  you're supposed to wait for your opportunity. But for beginners, like they think, when I did,
347.04s:  I thought so too. I thought I can come in every single day and there will be the same kind of
352.24s:  opportunities every single day, the same strategy. So I thought it's literally just rinse and repeat
357.52s:  and trying to, you know, make money print. So that's how I got burnt a lot in the beginning. Maybe
364.24s:  I'll have one good day where the market fits what I'm trying to trade. But next two or three days,
370.24s:  I shouldn't have traded at all, but I still kept on trying to make things happen, trying to squeeze
376.96s:  water out of rocks and then I'll just lose everything. So that's when I started to think about,
383.36s:  okay, maybe I should venture into small sorry mid caps and large cap stocks and kind of learn,
389.44s:  you know, a variety of different strategies that I can and four different stocks. So I can have
395.20s:  maybe, you know, instead of just one or two approach, I can have a playbook of five or six
400.64s:  different strategies to play with depending on the sentiment of the market. I see.
406.48s:  Now walk me through the time you spent in each of those stages. So the time that you started with
413.68s:  OTC and then kind of thereafter. Yeah. So to be honest, my timing when I was actually trading
421.60s:  the penny stocks and the in the small cap stocks in the very beginning, I'll just follow in chat room
426.80s:  alerts. Perfect. It's not really trading. So, you know, I'm sure you know, right? I know, I know,
432.40s:  but like, you know, you join those chat rooms and I'm literally just waiting for a text alerts.
438.48s:  And I'll try to buy the same stocks as whatever the person is trying to tell people to buy and he
443.68s:  got in a dollar. I tried to buy the same stock. I got in at 140 and he sold at 150 and then
450.40s:  myself was on reason the stocks back down to like 110 or $1. So that's honestly the very beginning
459.36s:  stages of my trading career if you even call that career. That brutal. I know, but I feel like
466.16s:  it's a hard lesson, but everyone needs to go through that to kind of understand that hey,
472.08s:  you kind of need to take this very seriously. Yeah. Kind of like, you know, a give rich quick scheme.
478.32s:  Well, it's funny for a few reasons too, because one of the first things you mentioned was the idea
483.20s:  of like fast money. And that is like one of the underpinning features that brings all of us to
491.20s:  the markets. That's why I started trading, right? Like all of us start this with this idea of like
496.24s:  fast money. And then the longer you you're around the game, the more you realize like, yeah,
502.24s:  like you can make a lot of money trading, but I wouldn't call it fast money. It's kind of money
507.68s:  that's, you know, earned over time. And then you got it. Then you got to keep it. But yeah,
513.36s:  I really commiserate with that. And then the other thing I was laughing about is when you're
517.04s:  talking about like the the alert service, funny enough, like I didn't even know what those were.
521.52s:  I found out what they were like two years ago, because somebody on my, yeah, somebody, yes,
527.68s:  because the way that I trade is completely different. I'm like in a vacuum. I'm just looking at
531.76s:  my stuff. I really don't care what anybody else is doing. Like I just do my stuff. And so
537.20s:  anyways, somebody on the YouTube channel, they reached out to me and they were like, hey,
540.88s:  you know, what do you think of like these trade that this like trading room or whatever?
544.48s:  And I was literally, I was just like, what the hell is that? And long story short, I ended up
549.52s:  doing like a couple of videos where like I paid to enter these rooms just to see what they were like.
554.88s:  And I'm like, this is crazy. Like they call each other analysts. And I'm like, this is nuts.
562.08s:  Yeah. So then I made a couple videos just honestly tearing them to shreds because it was the dumbest
568.72s:  stuff I've ever seen. But yeah, that's, I think it's really topical though that that's one of the
574.64s:  things you tried. I actually think that's a fantastic experience for you because it let's you.
578.72s:  I agree, actually. Yeah. Because I feel like it lets you become so much closer to the people
583.28s:  because that's what most people are doing now, which is kind of fascinating to me. So then
587.76s:  talked to me about the pivot from there. So you're buying your penny stocks for $1.40 and then
594.24s:  you're the alert dudes getting out of there at 150 and then you're like sick. Let me exit mine and
599.20s:  you're like, okay, well, I lost money on this. This isn't that fun. So then what led the transition
603.92s:  from there? Yeah. So it's just from a lot of losses. Like in the beginning, I blew up a couple
611.52s:  different accounts, the smaller accounts. They're like $2,000, $3,000 here and there. So I lost it all.
620.24s:  But in the meantime, even though I lost all the money, they were also a couple of times where
625.36s:  I actually made money. So that's why I still feel very encouraged that, hey, like it's, it is
631.76s:  possible to make money. But maybe I'm just not putting in enough effort to kind of get to kind
638.64s:  of understand the process and actually give it like a real shot at trading. I feel I realize that
644.40s:  you can make money. So some of those, you know, dreams that's been sold online. Some of that is true.
651.04s:  Like you said, you can make a lot of money. But my approach to this is just incorrect. So I
656.32s:  realized that, you know, maybe like into like six months or a year, then that's where I started to
662.16s:  put in some real efforts. And actually some of the things, the things that I did, I really changed
668.48s:  things around for me. The first one is building my own watch list. So when I said I was in the chat
674.88s:  rooms, I got wake up at 6.30 a.m. My local time here. So that would be 9.30 a.m. I used to wake up at
681.52s:  market time, market open and then think I can just trade based on the alerts, right? So I don't do that
687.36s:  anymore. So I decided that, hey, I need to wake up earlier. So I'll wake up at least an hour,
691.76s:  earlier before the market opens and I actually build my own watch list. So that's a huge difference.
698.16s:  Even just looking at up your own tickers, planning your own stuff, your own levels, like that's
704.16s:  that's a huge step in the right direction. And you know, it's kind of what differentiates a lot of
710.48s:  the, you know, the we call them like the sheep or like the followers who just wait for the chat room
715.44s:  alerts. That's a, you're kind of starting to become me more self-sufficient and planning
720.96s:  your own trades and kind of start to start thinking about the trades and the thesis by yourself.
727.04s:  So that's a huge step in the right direction in my opinion at a time. And then the second thing I
732.64s:  did was I start to, you know, manage risk more intentionally. They got playing out my risk
739.68s:  along with my watch list before I enter stock. I'm playing out, oh, if I can, you know, if I allow
745.68s:  myself to risk $20, you know, in the stock, you have for this one, I have to risk $20, that means I
752.08s:  can only take a certain amount of shares. So all of those would brand new to me at the time,
757.76s:  but it seems so simple and so easy now. But back then, I think most traders don't know you're supposed
764.00s:  to do those things for yourself. Most of you just want to follow and just want to make money
770.00s:  right away. Is that doing the real work that's required of them? So you kind of started then saying,
777.28s:  okay, I'm late to the punch on these. This isn't working that great. I'm going to try looking at
782.24s:  this stuff myself. One of the parts that fascinates me so much about your path is that you've really
788.40s:  still stayed centric on the same timeframes. You said that you swing trade sometimes, but like,
794.48s:  you still, it sounds like at that point, it was still mostly day trading focused. Is that correct?
799.20s:  Okay. Yes. And what has led you to really focus on day trading still up until this point? We've
807.04s:  started with looking for fast money. We started with small stocks, accessible penny stocks. You don't
811.68s:  need a lot of money. Then you're at this phase now where you're really starting to get into the nuts
816.24s:  and bolts of doing this thing. And you still favor the short term timeframes. Why was that?
821.36s:  Yeah. That's a very good question. Because one of the things I realized early on is that I need to
827.84s:  focus on trying to learn one thing really well in any given time. So while I did kind of like
836.64s:  dabble into swing trading or even options trading here and there, I realized that I wasn't good at
842.64s:  those things really, really quick. And I should just focus on the one thing that I'm trying to get
847.36s:  better at, which is day trading one or two different strategies. So that's one of the also another
854.00s:  pretty important moments for me because most people and I did this too when we first started,
860.24s:  we're just going to jump left and right and trying out different strategies that people are
864.48s:  talking about on Reddit in the chat rooms on X or Twitter. And then you kind of abandon your
871.20s:  original, your craft or the project or the strategy that you are studying in the first place.
877.52s:  So I figured out that, you know, in one of that kind of jump ship and chase a next shiny object,
883.84s:  I kind of lose focus and kind of have to go back to the beginning all over the again. So that's
889.28s:  why I decided, hey, I just want to focus on day trading. And, you know, don't worry about swing trading,
894.48s:  don't worry about options trading for now. I just want to get really good at this one thing and one
900.24s:  thing only. I love that. I think that that's a really interesting way in looking at it. And that's
906.72s:  a, I think a really important point for people actually. I'm so stoked that you hit that because
913.28s:  you that I think we've all done that where you kind of bounce between things and you don't have
918.56s:  much to show for it, which is always frustrating. Yeah. When you started getting into trading,
924.24s:  what led you into trading specifically? So you were looking for fast money, but there's other
929.92s:  ways to get fast money. You could be a drug dealer. You could snuggle people, right? There's lots of
935.68s:  careers. What led to trading specifically was there's something interesting of the markets where
940.72s:  you're doing work in some capacity around markets or did you just hear of it? And that was the route
946.00s:  you took. I started looking at alternative ways to make some more supplemental income because
954.00s:  at the time I had a full-time job in film in LA. Brent was expensive and my job and my employment
961.92s:  income was not stable. So I think I just kind of started searching up online. How do you make money
967.92s:  online? Or like site hustle ideas? And trading is the one that kind of appealed more to me because
974.72s:  I like the idea that I can sit in front of the computer before I go to work and then try to make
982.80s:  some money, maybe like $10, $20, $50 here and there and then leave and go to work. So I like the fact
989.76s:  that I can do the trading the morning and then go to my job. So that's what really appealed to me.
994.96s:  And I think I tried a couple of other things too, but this trading ended up, you know, ended up
999.84s:  as the one I focused on. I tried to control the things at the same time too, but ended up taking
1004.72s:  a focus. Got it. And was the focus on trading because you were finding success or was it because it
1011.76s:  was interesting to you or another reason? No, I definitely wasn't finding success in the beginning.
1018.96s:  So I'm glad you asked. But I just really liked it. Like I was really drawn to the idea that
1028.16s:  also like I was super young at the time, you know, I was in my early 20s, but I was super drawn to
1032.96s:  the fact that every single day is different in trading. I love that there's news that happened
1038.64s:  overnight and change the older numbers on the screen and the colors, the green and the red,
1044.24s:  everything can change every single second. I think I just love the adrenaline and I love that
1050.72s:  ever changing. And it's not just like a typical, you know, office job where you do the same task
1057.60s:  every single day. So I was young, I was naive and I was stupid and I was hooked.
1063.92s:  That sounds right. I think that is exactly what goes for all of us. So I'm right there with you.
1068.80s:  And so then you started going through this process of doing your own homework, creating your
1073.52s:  watch list, waking up earlier so that you could prep for the market, finding your levels.
1079.36s:  And how long were you doing this for? And is that still kind of what you're doing today or was there
1086.72s:  another pivot at some point beyond the pivot from small caps to mid and large cap stocks?
1093.12s:  That's a good question because I think my process of pre-market planning of, you know,
1100.00s:  looking for scanning for stocks to trade, reading the news and then creating my watch list
1106.32s:  has been pretty much very, very similar since that beginning stage. I kind of built the foundation
1112.64s:  from there and the small things changed here and there, like the little details. Before the most
1118.24s:  part of my process, the big picture process has been the same for the last, I've been trading for
1124.16s:  10 years, for the last seven years, it's been the same where I'm scanning for stocks and looking at
1129.68s:  the charts and looking at news and then I plan the individual plays or the potential trades that
1135.84s:  I'm going to trade. So for the most part, it's been the same even like after all these years.
1143.12s:  I see. Yeah, that makes a ton of sense. I think I find that too, like once you kind of find your
1147.60s:  rhythm that it's pretty easy to sustain it. So I think that that makes a lot of sense,
1153.84s:  especially with your approach. What time frames during the day do you like to trade the most?
1160.56s:  Because I know, at least from an options trading perspective, which is primarily what I do,
1164.56s:  there are different times of days that mean different things to me. And I'm wondering how you view
1169.44s:  the trading day. Yeah. So I usually start from looking at the dating charts. The
1176.56s:  dating is probably the timeframe in my opinion for my style is the most important. That's where I
1182.08s:  kind of have a general at these technical bias along with the news and all that of course, but
1189.04s:  the daily chart is where I plan out most of my trades using the daily levels, you know, the higher
1196.00s:  days, the daily resistance, the 52 week highs, those are probably the most important levels I'll look at.
1202.80s:  And then once I have that information, then I'll take a look at the intraday charts. I'm using a
1208.96s:  lot of the five minute charts nowadays. So that's one small detail that changed from 10 years ago. I
1215.84s:  used to use a lot more one minute charts. Nowadays, I use a five minute charts. And the shortest time
1221.92s:  frame I'll use is two minute charts. Got it. And do you wait those charts differently for different
1230.88s:  products or is the waiting about the same in terms of the time frames? Like if you're trading a
1236.72s:  mid cap stock versus a large cap stock, does the way you perceive those time frames carry over or
1243.04s:  does one get more weight than the other? Yeah. So the low, so we trade a lot of lower float
1250.72s:  small cap stocks. That's that's the kind of small cap stocks I would trade when I do trade them.
1256.48s:  So the lower the float and the smaller the market cap, the shorter time frame I go. So for those,
1262.80s:  usually I'll use a two minute chart. And then I'll look at five minutes as a reference. So anything
1269.12s:  under a billion dollars market cap, I will most likely be using a two minute time frame. And anything
1275.20s:  over a billion market cap, I'll be using the five minute or sometimes even the 15 minutes time frame.
1281.28s:  Got it. Yeah. I'm following you. Now we, you know we have to talk about this because you already
1288.40s:  spilled the beans that you tried trading options. You told me this when we had spoke. And as soon as
1294.08s:  I heard it, I was like, damn it. We were so close to converting another one. We were right there.
1300.56s:  And then it didn't work probably because of just call your lows, I would guess, but we, yeah,
1307.84s:  then damn call your lows. So we have to talk about the options because I got to tell you one of my
1315.20s:  long term roadmaps is like maybe over the next like 30 years. I'm just going to slowly try to
1321.04s:  move you towards options just a little bit. Maybe so that whenever we catch up once in a while,
1325.76s:  you're like, well, I got one trade on that'll, that'll be a big win for us out there. So I'm working
1331.20s:  on converting you at least to a degree. But to start the conversion, I need to understand the
1336.56s:  history with the product. So when did, when did you first stumble into options and how did it go?
1345.76s:  Yeah. So, take a guess. What do you think is the first kind of options trading style or approach I
1355.84s:  took? I would have to get out of the money calls. And I would guess shorter term expiration.
1365.84s:  I don't know what catalyst you would choose because one of the interesting thing about options
1370.88s:  is a lot of the small cap stocks you might have been trading at the time. They might not even have
1374.72s:  options. So that part I don't have a good read on, but that would be my my first level guess is
1383.76s:  that you're using further out of the money options because they're a cheaper and they can compound
1387.28s:  more and not going too far out in time because they're cheaper by not going too far out in time. That's
1392.48s:  the guess. Yeah, you're close. I was waiting at zero DTEs. I was trying to scalp those.
1401.60s:  So about as short as you can go. Got it. Yeah. Yeah.
1404.40s:  To shorten my time frame even more. Oh my god. Yeah, it was so wild. So especially on Fridays, I used to,
1412.40s:  so I at this point, I was still in a chat room. But the way I used to chat room was very different.
1418.08s:  I'm just trying to see what other people's ideas are and I'll see if there's anything I can trade
1424.16s:  out of their ideas like my own strategies. But in the same chat room, there's like an options chat room.
1431.12s:  So the stuff they're doing seems extremely intriguing. You take these options,
1438.40s:  contracts at only 50 cents and then if it hits, it can hit 500% in one day. So that's kind of what
1445.84s:  attracted me. And at this point, I was still already finding some success in trading stocks.
1451.28s:  So I just decided that, you know, oh, let me try this options thing on the side. Why not?
1457.84s:  So I kind of just kind of took like a course in options trading. And then I started trading
1464.56s:  these zero DTEs right away. And then a lot of the instruments I was trading were, you know, just like
1470.40s:  spy. Especially the, like you said, the yellow calls, expiring the same week or sometimes the same day.
1479.04s:  I remember trading a lot of Tesla when Tesla was really, really hot in 2016, 2017. That was really fun.
1487.68s:  But I don't think I ever made money from from zero DTEs. Like I'll make money here and there. But then
1495.04s:  when I lose money, I'll lose 100% of it. Right. So that kind of just cancels out everything. But
1501.76s:  it was fun. I'll say that. But also one of my blowups after,
1507.12s:  I want my blowups into my year four was because of options trading because of the zero DTEs.
1514.08s:  That's interesting that you blew up that way too, because I assume you were buying options. Yeah.
1518.88s:  Yes. Yes. Yeah. So to me, I actually find the idea of blowing up
1524.64s:  your buying options difficult because your max loss is defined at entry. So were you just
1531.04s:  sizing things like a gregiously large or what happened there? No, but it makes, it kind of makes
1538.80s:  sense because when I lose, I lose 100% of it. And sure, why make money? I'm not, I'm not, I wasn't
1546.00s:  that good. So it's not like I'm making money like a thousand percent, five hundred percent all the
1550.80s:  time. Well, sometimes why make money? It could be 50% 40% less. Maybe you have one or two,
1557.28s:  a couple hundred percent or a thousand percent. But I think in the long run, my win rate for the zero
1562.64s:  DTE trade is just so low that no, the older 100% losses on those trades cancels out everything
1571.20s:  and more. I see. Okay. So when you're saying, okay, I took blowup to be more of like a kinetic event,
1577.44s:  like in a single day big move, knocked us out, but it sounds more like you like over time,
1582.56s:  there was an erosion that essentially zeroed the account out. Yes. Yes. Okay. Got it. Yeah.
1588.64s:  The breaks my heart because whatever course you took that sent you into zero DTEs,
1596.00s:  we need to have a conversation with that course director, whoever that is and be like, what,
1600.80s:  what are we doing here? But okay. Yeah. You don't say, tell me more. I'm blown away that
1610.24s:  that could possibly be the case. Well, I think I still think for the way that you trade now,
1618.64s:  that options could be really good. But it would, I think you would have to change the way that you
1624.72s:  think about them and the way you use them. But we'll see. That'll be a future project where maybe
1629.68s:  I can slowly start subliminally messaging like long calls and short calls and maybe get you
1635.52s:  trading some volatility in there. I don't know. We'll see. Just send me those alerts. You know,
1640.72s:  that's it. I forgot. I just need to do alerts. How annoying is that? How annoying is that when
1646.32s:  people ask about, are you going to do alerts? Does that bother you? Yeah. It does. Like I'm like,
1652.72s:  why would you want that upon yourself to have to kind of have to kind of grow a dependency on
1660.80s:  someone else holding you what to do? It's your money. Like you need to be able to make the
1665.68s:  decisions for yourself. I almost feel offended for them when they ask me those things.
1670.88s:  The, the part that I always find so funny about it is I think a lot of us get into trading for
1675.52s:  the idea of making money so that then you achieve financial freedom. And then you,
1681.20s:  exactly as you say, you tie it. Your financial freedom is now predicated on this other person.
1686.80s:  Again, it's essentially just having a boss again. I know. Yeah. Yeah. I find that connection
1693.60s:  to be pretty funny. But it's still ironic too. Yeah. It is. Well, the pursuit of easy money is
1700.24s:  always a luring to everybody. It's why so many people will go play the lottery, right? Even though
1704.88s:  from a probability standpoint, it's not necessarily a great way. People will still do it. So,
1711.44s:  yeah, I could always see there being a group like that. When you look at your community that you've
1717.20s:  built, how have they evolved alongside your evolution of trading? Have they broadly moved with you?
1727.20s:  Do they do a lot of different things? But there's crossover. How does that work for your people?
1732.16s:  Yeah. That's a good question because I would say most people who join in the first place in
1738.48s:  that, say, that first month. And it's understandable. Most of you are more clueless. They kind of need
1744.88s:  a guidance. So they are more likely the beginners, the new new community members. They are more likely
1751.52s:  to kind of try to do exactly how I teach them the strategies. Like we have video lessons,
1758.32s:  they'll join. They'll try to do everything like by the book and copy exactly what I'm looking for,
1764.40s:  which is great. I rather them do that than to try to like figure out zero DTEs or try to
1770.56s:  trade stocks. But I think in the beginning, most people are going to be very by the book. Oh,
1776.96s:  that's say I'm looking for, I'm saying, oh, in the strategy, look for 20% gap, they'll do exactly
1782.64s:  that. And I think that's fine. But I think gradually, you know, most traders and most members
1788.48s:  after at least three or six months of very intensive learning and trading, they start to develop
1794.24s:  their own way of thinking. They start to change the strategy I teach them to kind of modify,
1799.84s:  to change and then to fit their own style. So maybe make strategy. The first one I taught them was
1805.84s:  you know, a little bit too conservative. Maybe they decide that, hey, like instead of risking 2%,
1811.04s:  I want to risk 5%. So by that time, it's up to them. They have the proper foundation,
1817.68s:  they know the tools and they have the knowledge, you kind of tweak the strategies, tweak the criteria,
1823.20s:  tweak the scanners to fit what works the best for them according to their risk tolerance.
1829.28s:  So in the beginning, everyone's not going to be by the book trying to copy exactly what you say
1835.76s:  in the video lessons. But at the end, you know, after a year, after two years, they usually develop
1841.52s:  their own style and they know exactly what they're looking for. And now a lot of the people who's
1846.80s:  been here for a while, I'm asking for their ideas. I'm asking to see what they're looking at because I
1853.28s:  know by now how they trade, they have almost like a different strategy after all this time.
1860.24s:  So it's kind of the reverse now. I would try to like pick the brain and try to see what they're
1864.96s:  looking at and see if there's anything I can use in my own strategies and try to apply my own
1871.20s:  thing to make money. So that's the thing I love about trading. You can be very flexible.
1877.12s:  You can make things your own. Yeah. Well, it's also cool that you guys create an environment for that
1883.28s:  because like we were talking about in the beginning, I actually think that's probably one of the most
1886.32s:  defining features of somebody that can be successful at this long term is doing exactly that. It's
1893.36s:  taking the time to like build something that makes sense for them. When you look over your trading
1899.76s:  career, what are some of the things that you used to do that as you think about it, you're like,
1905.28s:  why would I ever do that? But you did. What kind of things like that exists for you?
1912.00s:  Yeah. I think in the very beginning, I was very opposed to trading the mega caps,
1918.72s:  like the apples, the Amazon, the Google, the Nvidia. At the time, it didn't make sense because it
1926.32s:  felt like a very... Well, you trade options. I feel like you might agree with this. It felt like
1931.76s:  a very inefficient way of using your capital. Nvidia is now like what? What was it? $140 or
1941.68s:  something like that? If I traded, I'll probably have to... $140 at the time, I was trading a small
1949.60s:  account. I couldn't afford that many shares to make money. I can probably take what, 50 shares,
1955.60s:  and then try to make a dollar to dollars from that. This is day trading. At the time, it didn't make
1961.28s:  sense that why would anyone want to trade that? But I think now, I'm more open to the idea and
1967.60s:  actually prefer trading the big caps over the small caps because they are a lot more, in my opinion,
1974.80s:  at least in today, they're a lot more predictable. They kind of follow trends a certain way. And there
1980.96s:  are certain charts patterns and price action that you just see repeatedly again and again in all
1987.84s:  these mega-cap stocks. So now I'm more... A lot more open to the idea of, let's just say, trading
1994.88s:  and video, the actual stock. And something like Apple, Amazon, or even Tesla, I'll trade them.
2001.20s:  I'll take the extra shares. Got it. That's really interesting. When you're deciphering the
2008.64s:  predictability of something like mega-cap versus another size company, are you running a broad
2015.68s:  style analysis or is it kind of pattern-building by seeing and you're just looking at it every day?
2022.80s:  And that's how you're building your understanding of the relationship with some of these patterns.
2028.32s:  Yeah. So I used to study a lot of charts. I still do, but obviously not as intensive as I did
2034.64s:  the first four years. So I used to save charts and now I'll analyze... I'll say the different time
2040.48s:  frames. We talked about like one minute chart, deity chart, five minute charts. So I used to say
2047.12s:  those charts, well all the stocks I've traded. And it's not like I memorized a pattern,
2053.44s:  but over time you kind of start seeing some similar trends and some similar patterns.
2058.56s:  That's how the morning setup looks a certain way on the five minute chart and there's
2062.56s:  negative news in the market. There's certain things that you can't predict them or guarantee it
2069.44s:  100% all the time, but there's certain things that you start to see that, hey, maybe I can...
2074.80s:  I can use educated guests and then try to build a strategy around when the chart sets up this way,
2082.08s:  when it gaps up and sells off to the middle of the day, what's likely going to happen. So to
2088.32s:  answer your questions, a lot of that is just based on past experience and seeing the same charts
2094.16s:  and the same price action over and over again. So a lot of observation time, yeah. That's one of
2101.52s:  the things that always fascinated me with like pattern style trading because I tend to apply
2108.08s:  a bit of a quantitative approach with a practical approach. I'm like a middle ground between something
2113.68s:  like what you would do versus what like a quant would do. I'm like the... I'm kind of like the idiot
2120.00s:  that does both and not that great. That's really what it was down to. So it's kind of cool that
2124.64s:  you've picked a specific learning modality that is really connected for you. When you're looking at
2130.80s:  these different patterns and stuff, especially when it comes to short-term trading timeframes,
2136.16s:  there's a million of them. You see so many people talk about all of these different kinds of
2140.16s:  candlestick pattern setups, price levels, stuff like that. How did you start to navigate to like
2145.12s:  what worked for you? How did you find that? Because one of the things I'm trying to strike at here is
2151.68s:  when you're first starting, if you're trying to find something that works, you try it for two weeks,
2157.36s:  it doesn't work. And then you dump it. That might have been the right thing, but you just might not
2163.28s:  have tried it for long enough. So I feel like that's a really difficult balance to strike. And obviously
2168.16s:  you found a way to navigate that. So can you talk us through it? Yeah, I think that's a... that's a
2174.56s:  that's a common question. I see a lot as well. But I think usually when people ask me that,
2181.04s:  well like a lot of those are actually my members in my community. When they say that to me, I'm like,
2186.24s:  okay, show me your journal. Show me the charts. Show me the charts you saved. That's the end.
2190.32s:  And then they usually say, oh, I don't have it. So a lot of times you might be trying... they might be
2196.88s:  trying that set strategy or that set chart pattern or that set set up for two weeks. But when they
2204.00s:  don't actually journal it down and save the charts, then I don't think that's... I don't think you
2210.56s:  are actually testing and testing the strategy the right way when you are not recording actual data.
2216.88s:  So the way I look at it is at least you need at at least 50 sample size of those trades and
2223.68s:  everything needs to be journaled and then the charts need to be saved. And then for you to go back
2228.56s:  and actually look at, okay, like is it me or is it a strategy? I think people have to kind of
2236.48s:  answer that question themselves, honestly. So that's how I kind of start to navigate building
2242.32s:  set up is from saving tons of charts, whether it's the actual strategies that traded or the ones I missed
2249.20s:  by didn't trade. I still see a similar set of... I'll save it. I'll collect a bunch of sample sizes
2254.56s:  of a particular strategy that I think, hey, there might be a pattern there or there might be a
2260.40s:  strategy here that that's repeatable. Start with collecting charts and then I used to be very,
2266.00s:  very big into spreadsheet. So I'll spreadsheet everything. That's a, you know, the smoke cap stock
2271.52s:  when it gaps up over 50%. You know, it's likely to have like an old day fade and I'll track the
2277.60s:  success of that and how what's a percentage of the fade can be. You know, I'm saying like,
2283.36s:  when a stock gaps up, we're talking about just smoke cap stocks. What's the probability of this
2288.08s:  happening? And I'll even track it by months. So, you know, during summer months, the probabilities
2293.60s:  like 30% was lower during the winter and the fall and the spring, the probabilities a lot higher.
2300.00s:  So I use to track everything. So that's how I start to build at these some sense of, okay, pattern
2307.04s:  recognition in which I call this actual valuable data collection, actual valuable information.
2314.56s:  As opposed to just trying to set up for two weeks, thinking you actually tried the strategy,
2320.08s:  but in fact, you didn't record any of it. I hope this makes sense. I feel like it makes a ton of
2326.80s:  sense. It makes a ton of sense because I find people do that with a ton of things across trading,
2332.32s:  where they have hazardly tried something. There's no record to actually refer what the outcomes were.
2338.72s:  Yeah. And there, there, those kinds of things are so prone to path. And that's kind of what I was
2343.28s:  highlighting by talking that through with you because if you tried something for two weeks and then
2348.48s:  you just bail on it, that thing might have worked, but you don't have a good record to be able to
2354.16s:  say objectively, yes or no, and you might not have let it try long enough. Now, going back to the
2360.32s:  broader question, though, when you first started trading like these different setups and patterns,
2366.80s:  how did you call through the thousands that are there and say, I'm going to try these 15,
2373.92s:  these 10, these five, whatever and see how these work. And then how did you narrow that down? Because
2379.92s:  when I think about the prospects of day trading via some sort of like candlestick patterns or
2383.76s:  just price behavior on an intraday time frame, I think that's probably one of the most common things
2388.72s:  I see people talk about is like, how do you pick? Are you going to use a doji? Are you going to use
2394.16s:  the hammers? Like they use all the individual candles, then setups of candles like the three of three
2398.64s:  down, like all those kinds of things. How did you sift through the broad universe of intraday patterns
2405.36s:  into the things you thought were worth testing? And then from there, how did you narrow that down
2410.32s:  further? So I think there's two aspects to this question. The first one is, I don't actually
2417.36s:  know, I know kennel said patterns and chart patterns are, I know people use an interchangeably,
2424.24s:  but I don't actually use the candlestick patterns like, oh, sugar star, like I don't actually use that.
2432.32s:  But I look at the bigger picture, like what the entire day chart look like, whether it has higher
2438.00s:  lows, I look at that and what the trend looks like. So I'm more, I'm also looking at candlestick trends
2443.36s:  than the individual candlestick patterns. But when that's my style of looking at charts,
2451.12s:  but when I look at the entire chart, I feel like I can see a bigger picture. Now where does that
2456.32s:  initial inspiration come from? Well, it comes from like the initial when I was in the chat rooms and
2462.40s:  I took a lot of courses. While the chat room alerts don't work, I do believe in like some of the
2470.08s:  educations that taught you, even though you cannot just like I said, you cannot take someone's
2475.44s:  a strategy and kind of completely copy and make it, make it work for you. A lot of times you can
2480.72s:  be inspired by it. And even, even if it doesn't work for you at the end, you know, you can be inspired
2487.76s:  by it and look at the chart that maybe, you know, perhaps somebody is doing a, you know, a dip by
2494.08s:  strategy, even if that actual execution execution or strategy doesn't work for me. I look at that
2500.32s:  chart, I look at it's the chart patterns that talking about what the daily chart looks like, what
2505.28s:  the intraday looks like. And then I'll start seeing that. Okay, like, you know, even though I cannot
2509.92s:  execute the trades like he was she taught me to, I can still trade the same chart in my own way.
2516.16s:  So that's why I'm in by I was really inspired by a lot of the common chart patterns the small
2520.80s:  tap traders use. Some common ones are like the first green day, the first red day or like the
2527.36s:  parabolic charts. Those are really, really common chart patterns with very similar appearances in
2533.76s:  the daily charts all the time for small cap stocks. And then from there, I kind of just kind of start
2539.68s:  building my own kind of executions. And then talk me through how those executions translated into what
2547.20s:  you trade now. So before you're looking at first green day, first red day, parabolic moves,
2553.44s:  what does that turn into? And what have you noticed about what applies to small caps and may or
2560.24s:  may not apply to larger mega caps? Yeah. So I mean, I think it's better if I pick like a like a
2569.60s:  specific kind of chart, like a specific strategy. So there's a I can pull a chart up if you want.
2576.08s:  Sure. Let me think what's a good one? We can look at.
2582.32s:  Here you go. And
2588.40s:  okay, we can look at let's say, I'm video. Oh, this is not a really good example. We can look at
2596.96s:  SMCI. And then what time frame do you like? Uh, deity. And then what do we call back to um,
2607.92s:  mid February until February 16. So from early February to February 16, 2024 on the deity.
2619.68s:  Oh, daily candles got it. That deity candles. Yeah. Got it. Oh, that's actually really cool that
2625.44s:  you do that. And then you said, yeah, February. Mm hmm. Oh, one. I bet.
2634.80s:  You can do February first. I think February first till just you can or you can just do the entire
2641.36s:  February. If it's easier. Got it. Yes. So I have February first until today. Okay. Sweet.
2650.16s:  And then I have us on a daily and then I can get rid of this this crap. These are just moving
2654.80s:  averages. If it's too noisy, I can dump them. But okay. So the the chart I want to focus on is
2661.52s:  the early February where you can see like this consecutive green candles when the stock went
2667.84s:  from 400 to a thousand dollars in like what two weeks or so. So you see all those straight up green
2674.48s:  candles. So when I see that on the daily chart, whether it's a small cap or a large cap, like we
2680.00s:  call this like a parabolic daily chart when the stock just goes up and up and up with very little
2686.40s:  pullback every single day. And so number one, why I see that I know that okay, like short sellers
2692.88s:  are getting squeezed. You know, we saw some similar patterns for GameStop, for the Tesla years ago,
2700.72s:  short sellers are getting squeezed. And every single day the dips are getting bought back up.
2705.44s:  So I know that the shorts are in pain. But at the same time, you know, we also know that eventually,
2710.96s:  you know, I say eventually, there will be a huge red day to pullback because in terms of price
2716.88s:  action, this is like, you know, a lot of irrational buying and also a lot of the a lot of the buying
2723.60s:  is from short sellers covering on the way up. We're talking about all the parabolic green candles.
2729.12s:  So there's a couple ways to play this when, you know, as crazy and as dangerous as the sounds,
2735.36s:  a lot of times with these kind of parabolic daily charts, we do what I do, I say the trend
2740.96s:  joined long. I'll try to join a trend and intraday out, I'll keep buying on the way up because I
2745.84s:  know shorts are getting squeezed. I'll try to do that on like the third or the fourth day,
2751.12s:  green candle. And a lot of times I'll swing them even like after a day, try to swing them into those
2756.80s:  huge, you can see like, you know, nearly and the candles stay between in between the
2763.76s:  the last three green candles before the huge red candle. There's a huge gap in between.
2770.16s:  So this is how you know, like a stock is like taking off. Like it's already going parabolic when
2775.84s:  there's a huge gap in between the candles. And there's going to be a huge red day coming soon.
2780.72s:  It could be the next three days, four days, five days. But then if, you know, I will take the longs
2786.96s:  during those intraday and try to like take advantage of those huge moves. That's when, you know,
2792.32s:  the the the the the ATR, the sorry, the average to range of a stock can increases a lot intraday,
2800.08s:  the range of the stock. So I'll go long during those. I call the trend joined long when I see this kind
2806.00s:  of daily candles. And then a lot of traders, small caps or large caps, they'll time that huge red
2812.16s:  candle. So the first red day, the reason is called the first red days because you have multiple days
2818.72s:  of green candle going into it. So there hasn't been a huge pullback at all since, you know, this is
2824.00s:  what February first was February second. So the stock has been green for the last two weeks straight.
2829.68s:  So when there's a red candle, that candle is going to be huge. So usually when we try to short those
2836.96s:  when once the stock is actually red on the day, then I'll short those knowing that the downside is
2843.36s:  a lot greater because the stock has been so extended, right? It's like polling a rubber band. When you
2849.36s:  stretch it so far for so many days and you just so intense and there's just so much buying tight in
2856.72s:  the stock, when finally you release the rubber band finally, it's going to snap all the way over
2863.44s:  and I go over extended to a downside. So then what time and try to trade a short day when there
2869.60s:  is a short day confirmed, then you just join it to the downside this time. You just short it all the
2874.64s:  way down a lot of times you get like a pullback for two or three days. So then now be the other side
2880.56s:  of the trade once the the parabolic breakout move is done, then you try to I tried to trade the
2886.72s:  first red day. But you know, the patterns that we look at we start from the date and they I'll trade
2892.96s:  it today. What's really funny is I have to be honest with you. I didn't expect this, but you and I
2899.36s:  look at some of the same things and we do, but we trade them slightly differently. So for for
2906.80s:  stuff like this, I have kind of different scans that count consecutive updates. Essentially,
2913.12s:  soon as there's three or above, it adds it to a list and then I rank it by gaps between them.
2918.88s:  Okay. And I look for a very similar and it's funny. I call it the same thing a parabolic
2923.60s:  up move. And I'll trade those with options though, but I typically don't try to do it in
2930.40s:  trade day, but I normally will try to run it over a timeframe for your perspective. It looks
2936.56s:  like some of these intraday periods would be much more lucrative than others. Is there a way that
2942.48s:  you kind of screen how strong you think the day might be for a move as compared to something else?
2947.52s:  Because I look at these and these are kind of like little boring days, probably not well, I guess
2951.44s:  that is a big candle. Maybe this one's a better example. And you know, it's a smaller overall day
2957.12s:  as compared to stuff like this that have just much bigger moves. Do you wait them in some way? Do
2963.28s:  you have some sort of predictive tool that you try to analyze what you think that up move might
2968.72s:  look like for the day? Yeah, I keep it extremely simple. The day I'm trading and I say today's Friday,
2975.76s:  then today's open and today's lower day needs to be higher than yesterday's higher day.
2982.96s:  So the stock needs to have already opened and traded above the high day from the day before. So
2989.12s:  the candles you're pointing at those tiny ones, I wouldn't be trading those because they're under
2994.16s:  your studies highs. Got it. Yep. So the high was here. This one opened it looked like super close to it.
2999.84s:  This one you definitely wouldn't have touched. This one you wouldn't have touched. And then this
3005.60s:  this typically then would you think you'd be entering in like something like in here? Yes.
3009.84s:  Yeah, once the one's a stock breaks above yesterday's right. Yeah. Got it. And then when you're
3016.72s:  looking for the short, it sounds like this one is a little bit more of a carry trade for you.
3022.16s:  Less of an intraday thinks you said typically there's successive days that follow that is there a
3028.32s:  reason why you trade this over a couple days and not to try to hold this for a couple day move?
3035.12s:  Or is it this one you're just expecting to trade at intraday? Anyways, capture most of the move
3040.24s:  and then this one you have some sort of data that infers once this happens, it's overwhelmingly
3047.20s:  probabilistic going to be a continuation move of some sort. Yeah. So I'm trying to kind of adapt
3055.28s:  a little bit more now. Before the long side and short side for both of those, I will only swing
3060.64s:  it and keep it for a couple of days. If I like I would open a start or trade as a day trade.
3067.52s:  And then I'll close it and look at a chart and see whether there might be more than next day.
3072.80s:  And now it may be like save like a quarter of my day trade into the next couple of days.
3077.92s:  So that's how I usually do things, but I'm trying to kind of try to maximize the trade with a
3085.52s:  separate swing trading account. Now I kind of open a new account in the middle of the year.
3090.40s:  So that one I want to start to maximize it and just strictly do day trade.
3094.64s:  As a swing trade in that account. Yeah, I love that because one of the things I think about
3099.92s:  especially is your highlighting, which makes a lot of sense to me with the way that you're playing
3104.00s:  the parabolic move, but the point that I would be curious about is the gaps that you would miss.
3108.96s:  Because a lot of these moves and it's from I run it through Python. So I have like a really large
3115.28s:  data set depending on the kind of product and the behavior when it starts moving into these
3121.28s:  parabolic up moves. And to me, that seems like a really strong return source for you potentially.
3127.36s:  So that's cool that you're kind of tinkering with that. I love that.
3130.96s:  You think of it that way. That's super cool. Thank you so much for walking through some of
3134.80s:  this stuff. I love learning and sharing different approaches to markets that's kind of some of
3139.44s:  the coolest parts about this. Yeah. And like it's really cool that we both see the same chart.
3146.16s:  We're just describing and maybe we sometimes we use both say parabolic, but maybe in the beginning,
3151.44s:  you didn't really understand what I was talking about until we see the same chart that we know all
3156.24s:  what's talking about the exact same chart. I have to like I did not expect that. I really didn't.
3161.28s:  I thought that you would be looking for completely different things than I typically do. And then
3165.36s:  as soon as you pointed that out, I was like, this is actually kind of nuts because there's like heavy
3170.32s:  crossover there. Even the way that you play the down move is fascinating to me. I play that a little
3175.28s:  differently. Not in terms of following the trend down. I'll do that, but I don't use strategies
3181.60s:  that capitalize on the down moves as much. So you've actually given me some homework. Believe it or
3186.80s:  not. Take a look at the probability of the big red day and the size of the move on those. So thank
3192.16s:  you for thank you for the homework. Oh, a couple of last questions for you. So I think one of the
3199.76s:  coolest things that traders that have been in the game for a while can do is to just share
3206.16s:  not necessarily some of their biggest mistakes. There's a million of those all over the place.
3210.64s:  But the thing I like to try to explore with people are some of the things that you learned and
3216.72s:  think other people should know that are not talked about that much. Do you have anything like that
3221.76s:  that comes to mind for you and your path? Yeah. So that's also another reason I'm trying to
3228.72s:  swing trade more this year and even open the new account because I do feel like
3235.04s:  day traders for the most part would leave a lot of money on the table. So I agree with what you
3241.20s:  said before. Like, you know, like you can maximize it more. So that's the one part I'm really trying
3246.56s:  to work on this year and next year. I do think that there are a lot of times where, you know,
3252.64s:  yeah, day trading, you can make a lot of money, but for certain chart patterns, like the one we just
3257.92s:  talked about, you know, you can make even more with swing trading. You know, we just obviously
3264.32s:  with a swing trading, I would be more selective and only swing trade when I see, you know,
3268.80s:  certain very, very good setups. I think just day trading wouldn't do it justice. So I think that's
3275.20s:  a part that I'm trying to learn more and improve on this year. And I don't think I mean, the,
3281.52s:  I don't think I am allowed to say that, oh, I have it figured out, I'll have it figured out in
3288.24s:  terms of maximizing my swing trading. But I think just the fact that this year, I'm really trying
3293.52s:  to work on turning some really good day trades into swing trades. I think that's a good start. But
3299.36s:  no, I'm not by no means am I an expert in swing trading. I think that's awesome. And I think more
3305.60s:  than anything, you're sharing such an important mindset, which is evolution, right? Like you've
3311.52s:  been trading for over a decade now and you were talking about that and the way you do things. And
3317.20s:  I have to say that's just another pure commonality I find between those of us that tend to trade
3323.36s:  for a long time is we constantly are looking for other ways we can do things like you gave me an
3330.00s:  idea in this one, right? Like that's the whole point is that we're always looking for different
3333.36s:  things. So I'm actually really stoked about the swing training component and I am eager to hear
3339.84s:  your results because I have some ideas on what we'll see and I think it'll be good to be honest.
3345.52s:  So I'm excited for that. The last question I have for you is I know that the Lamborghini is a big
3352.48s:  part of your brand, right? Like we have the Lamborghini microphone. I don't even know what those
3357.52s:  things are called the low microphone cover thing. You know, I guess maybe so people hit themselves
3367.12s:  on the face or something crazy. But anyways, I love the joke around the Lamborghini, but I am a car
3375.20s:  guy and I love McLaren's. So I'm wondering if I can find a way to send you a McLaren thing and
3383.52s:  maybe once in a while I could get a guest appearance on the mic thing. We can try. I mean, I don't know.
3389.92s:  I have my clearance, I could supposedly better than Lamborghini. I don't know cars. So
3395.76s:  it's one of those things that like better is such a strange thing. It's like they're all so
3401.04s:  over that I have them. I have them. I love them. But like it's all just so over the top. It's all
3406.24s:  bullshit. So I wouldn't call one inherently better than the other. It's kind of like none of us
3410.96s:  that are buying them. I run a car club. So like I love driving and stuff like that, but not a
3416.40s:  professional driver. So you could have somebody that's probably a professional driver beat me in
3420.48s:  a Honda Civic. So you know, it's I think it's more about what style you like. But anyways, I am
3426.80s:  curious. I have to see if I can find one of those little microphone cover things and see if I can
3431.04s:  get just just a one guest stand in would be great. That would be pretty cool. Yeah, if you can find
3436.00s:  that I would love to feature a McLaren. Perfect. Well, I love that. I'll keep that door open.
3441.52s:  This is good. I mean, this is a great win for my side of the deal because I'm going to slowly
3447.84s:  pressure you hopefully more and more to looking at options. And then maybe we get them
3452.72s:  clearing out there. So I call it a great victory across the board. But it's time for you to run. And
3459.44s:  I am just so appreciative for you to come hang out for a while, especially because you really do
3465.68s:  bring such a different perspective. And my hands down favorite thing about you, it's what drew
3471.28s:  me to you in the first place is that I find that there are so few genuine voices in this space.
3477.84s:  And it's very cool to find one that I would consider to be very genuine. So thanks for doing
3483.76s:  everything that you do. And thanks for coming to hang out for a while. Thanks Eric. Yeah, that was
3488.16s:  fun conversation. I promise at some point I will promise to properly look at options.
3495.44s:  And give a shot. I can promise you that. That's the one.
3499.92s:  Let me know whenever you do I'll literally jump on a call with you. And I will hold your hand
3504.40s:  all the way through it to make sure that it's not a bad experience. Because I think especially
3509.36s:  for your style of trading, they really could be very cool. But yeah, we'll have to tinker with them.
3513.76s:  Thank you so much for your time. And then for people that want to find you, like I said, I'll throw
3518.00s:  your website. And all of your other social media handles in the description. Is there anywhere else
3524.40s:  that you want to direct people to or anything like that? I think just my YouTube, Instagram,
3529.92s:  my website, socials, all that good stuff is good. Perfect. So you guys can check all of that out
3535.76s:  in the description below. Thanks everybody for hanging out. Be an outlier. And we'll see you guys later.
