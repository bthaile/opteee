 What's up everyone? Welcome back to the Outlier podcast. I have my friend, Shay from Humboldt Trader. I'll throw a link to all of her stuff in the description below, but we're reconnecting because I was out visiting her in Vancouver a couple months ago for a podcast and really enjoyed the conversation. And I think your approach to markets from what I can tell is really interesting. One of the things I try to do with my podcast is to put different approaches in front of people because one of my stances on trading is such a big component of it is finding something that aligns with you and like your personality and like what makes sense for the way you think about the world and markets. And I think you offer a really cool perspective. So thanks for coming to hang out. Thanks for having me, Eric. It's an honor to be on your podcast. It's a blast. So first of all, I have to ask when the summer kept running out there, when I was in Vancouver, it was gorgeous. Is it still like that or does it start getting like super humid and stuff? It's it's gotten hotter now. But it's doesn't ever get humid here. It's really dry here on the west coast. So it's actually really, really nice out like if you like the beach, if you like a beach weather, like that's this like a perfect time in Vancouver. Oh, that's awesome. Yeah, when I was out there, I was so stoked with the weather and I was curious if it starts heating up a ton. So speaking of heating up, I you primarily trade small caps, or not necessarily like penny stocks or anything like that, but not not large cap. You're primarily like day trading small cap stocks. Is that correct? Actually, in the recent years, I trade more of the mid caps and larger cap stocks. And then I'll dabble into the small caps when I see really good opportunities. Maybe like a couple of times a month. Got it. And just for my understanding, how do you define mid cap? What market cap falls into there? Well, I kind of categorize large cap, mid cap, all together. Anything over a billion market cap, I kind of trade them a certain way. And then anything under I trade it as just small caps. Got it. Yeah. Then I see how you're breaking it down there. And so what do you make of the recent market activity? We've been selling off for a couple days now. How does that impact your approach? Yeah. So this year, at least for me, what's being working really well for me has just been going long on the large cap stocks. So when the markets are selling off, honestly, they should be told it's hard for me to find setups I really want to trade. So the last couple of days, I just kind of been sitting on the sidelines, I scalped here and there, really, really short term. But I'm honestly just like, you know, looking and looking and waiting for the right opportunities to get back in. So when the market sells off, I'm just kind of on the sidelines. I don't really short sell large caps that much this year. I got them burnt in the beginning of the year. So that's why even though we have short term pullback, like right now, I'm still just, you know, re-empatients and waiting for the right opportunities. Got it. Yeah. And another question I had with your approach specifically is, what's your methodology for identifying like these market turnovers? Because I imagine you trade typically shorter term time frames. So that's one of the benefits, you know, perceivably in terms of the purpose of day trading, you're supposed to be able to catch these kinds of capitulations. What's your approach to doing that? Yeah. So like you said, the benefit is overnight, we don't have any exposure, unless I'm doing some swing trading. But most of the time I'm day trading and, you know, overnight, I don't really have to worry about anything. So if I wake up, I see everything's gapping down, you know, continuing to sell off like the last two days, I would look at things and wait for maybe two hours to see if there's a reversal to get in. But if not, then, you know, it doesn't really affect me. So that's one of the benefits of day trading. I don't really have to time anything. I see. Yeah. Yeah. The reason why I kind of dove straight into methodology from the jump is just because I thought the market activity's been interesting. And I want to dive more into the way you think about it later. But to take us a couple steps back now, I would love to understand the way that you entered markets. Because when you and I spoke, you'd mention that you've tried a few different things. And even now you've mentioned that you've tried a few different things. So walk me through when you started trading and then kind of a evolution after that. Yeah. I went first kind of learned about what trading is was 10 years ago. I went first graduated from college. And in the beginning, you know, I just wanted like fast money, right? I saw the ads for penny stocks. So back then, my first introduction was like OTC stocks, penny stocks. And we're talking about the stocks are literally two or three cents. So that's my very beginning. I was trying to buy pump and dumps and then eventually learn to short sell the pump and dump stocks. So that's kind of my first introduction. And then gradually, I realized that, you know, small caps and penny stocks, they're kind of extremely cyclical. Stock market is cyclical in nature, but for the smaller cap stocks, even more so. Sometimes the cycles can rotate really fast in the matter of a couple of days or even weeks. So at least in the very beginning, I was a trader, you're supposed to wait for your opportunity. But for beginners, like they think, when I did, I thought so too. I thought I can come in every single day and there will be the same kind of opportunities every single day, the same strategy. So I thought it's literally just rinse and repeat and trying to, you know, make money print. So that's what I got burnt a lot in the beginning. Maybe I'll have one good day where the market fits what I'm trying to trade. But next two or three days, I shouldn't have traded at all, but I still kept on trying to make things happen, trying to squeeze water out of rocks and then I'll just lose everything. So that's when I started to think about, okay, maybe I should venture into small sorry, mid caps and large cap stocks and kind of learn, you know, a variety of different strategies that I can and four different stocks. So I can have maybe, you know, instead of just one or two approach, I can have a playbook of five or six different strategies to play with depending on the sentiment of the market. I see. Now walk me through the time you spent in each of those stages. So the time that you started with OTC and then kind of thereafter. Yeah. So to be honest, my timing when I was actually trading the penny stocks and the in the small cap stocks in the very beginning, I was just following chat room alerts. Perfect. It's not really trading. So, you know, I'm sure you know, right? I know, I know. But like, you know, you join those chat rooms and I'm literally just waiting for a text alerts. And I'll try to buy the same stocks as whatever the person is trying to tell people to buy. And he got in a dollar. I tried to buy the same stock. I got in at 140 and he sold at 150 and then when I sell for some reason, the stocks back down to like 110 or a dollar. So that's honestly the very beginning stages of my trading career if you even call that career. That brutal. I know. But I feel like it's a hard lesson, but everyone needs to go through that to kind of understand that, hey, you kind of need to take this very seriously. Yeah. Kind of like, you know, a give rich quick scheme. Well, it's funny for a few reasons too, because one of the first things you mentioned was the idea of like fast money. And that is like one of the underpinning features that brings all of us to the markets. That's why I started trading, right? Like all of us start this with this idea of like fast money. And then the longer you you're around the game, the more you realize, like, yeah, like you can make a lot of money trading, but I wouldn't call it fast money. It's kind of money that's, you know, earned over time. And then you got it. Then you got to keep it. But yeah, I really commiserate with that. And then the other thing I was laughing about is when you were talking about like the the alert service funny enough, like I didn't even know what those were. I found out what they were like two years ago, because somebody on my, somebody yes, because the way that I trade is completely different. I'm like in a vacuum. I'm just looking at my stuff. I really don't care what anybody else is doing. Like I just do my stuff. And so anyways, somebody on the YouTube channel, they reached out to me and they were like, Hey, you know, what do you think of like these trade that this like trading room or whatever? And I was I literally was just like, what the hell is that? And long story short, I ended up doing like a couple of videos where like I paid to enter these rooms just to see what they were like. And I'm like, this is crazy. Like they call each other analysts. And I'm like, this is nuts. Yeah. So then I made a couple videos just honestly tearing them to shreds because it was dumbest stuff I've ever seen. But yeah, that's I think it's really topical though that that's one of the things you tried. I actually think that's a fantastic experience for you because it let's you actually. Yeah. Because I feel like it lets you become so much closer to the people because that's what most people are doing now, which is kind of fascinating to me. So then talked to me about the pivot from there. So you're you're buying your your penny stocks for $1.40 and then you're the alert dudes getting out of there at 150 and then you're like sick. Let me exit mine and you're like, Okay, well, I lost money on this. This isn't that fun. So then what led the transition from there? Yeah. So it's just from a lot of losses like in a big ending, I blew up a couple of different accounts, the smaller accounts. They're like a $2,000, $3,000 here and there. So I lost it all. But in the meantime, even though I lost all the money, they were also a couple of times where I actually made money. So that's why I still feel very encouraged at hey, like it's it is possible to make money. But maybe I'm just not putting in enough effort to kind of get to kind of understand the process and actually give it like a real shot at trading. I feel I realize that you can make money. So some of those, you know, dreams that's being sold online. Some of that is true. Like that you say, you can make a lot of money. But my approach to this is just incorrect. So I realize that, you know, maybe like into like six months or a year, then that's where I started to put in some real effort. And actually some of the things, the things that I did, I really changed things around for me. The first one is building my own watch list. So when I said I was in the chat rooms, I got wake up at 6.30 a.m. My local time here. So that will be 9.30 a.m. I used to wake up at market time, market open and then think I can just trade based on the alerts, right? So I don't do that anymore. So I decided that hey, I need to wake up earlier. So I'll wake up at least an hour earlier before the market opens and I actually build my own watch list. So that's a that's a huge difference. Even just looking at up your own tickers, planning your own stuff in your own levels. Like that's that's that's a huge step in the right direction. And you know, it's it's kind of what differentiates a lot of the, you know, the we call them like the sheep or like the followers who just wait for the chat room alerts. That's a you're kind of starting to become more self-sufficient and planning your own trades and kind of start to start thinking about the trades and the thesis by yourself. So that's a huge step in the right direction in my opinion at a time. And then the second thing I did was I start to, you know, manage risk more intentionally. They got playing out my risk along with my watch list before I enter a stock. I'm playing out. Oh, if I can, you know, if I allow myself to risk $20, you know, in the stock, you know, for this one, I have to risk $20. That means I can only take a certain amount of shares. So all of those would brand new to me at a time. But it seems so simple and so easy now. But back then, I think most traders don't know you're supposed to do those things for yourself. Most people just want to follow and just want to make money right away. Is they doing the real work that's required of them? So you kind of started then saying, okay, I'm late to the punch on these. This isn't working that great. I'm going to try looking at this stuff myself. One of the parts that fascinates me so much about your path is that you've really still stayed centric on the same timeframes. You said that you swing trade sometimes, but like, you still, it sounds like at that point, it was still mostly day trading focused. Is that correct? Okay. Yes. And what has led you to really focus on day trading still up until this point? We've started with looking for fast money. We started with small stocks, accessible penny stocks. You don't need a lot of money. Then you're at this phase now where you're really starting to get into the nuts and bolts of doing this thing. And you still favor the short term timeframes. Why was that? Yeah. That's a very good question. Because one of the things I realized early on is that I need to focus on trying to learn one thing really well in any given time. So while I did kind of like dabble into swing trading or even options trading here and there, I realized that I wasn't good at those things really, really quick. And I should just focus on the one thing that I'm trying to get better at, which is day trading one or two different strategies. So that's one of the also another pretty important moments for me because most people and I did this too when we first started, we're just kind of jump left and right and trying out different strategies that people are talking about on Reddit in the chat rooms on X or Twitter. And then you kind of abandon your original, your craft or the project or the strategy that you are studying in the first place. So I figured out that, you know, in one of that kind of jump ship and chase the next shiny object, I kind of lose focus and kind of have to go back to the beginning all over the again. So that's why I decided, hey, I just want to focus on day trading. And you know, don't worry about swing trading. Don't worry about options trading for now. I just want to get really good at this one thing and one thing only. I love that. I think that that's a really interesting way in looking at it. And that's a, I think a really important point for people actually. I'm so stoked that you hit that because you that I think we've all done that where you kind of bounce between things and you don't have much to show for it, which is always frustrating. When you started getting into trading, what led you into trading specifically? So you were looking for fast money, but there's other ways to get fast money. You could be a drug dealer. You could smell people, right? There's lots of careers. What led to trading specifically? Was there something interesting of the markets? Were you doing work in some capacity around markets or did you just hear of it? And that was the route you took. I started looking at alternative ways to make some more supplemental income because at the time I had a full-time job in film in LA, Brent was expensive and my job and my employment income was not stable. So I think I just kind of started searching up online. I how do you make money online or like site hustle ideas? And trading is the one that kind of appealed more to me because I like the idea that I can sit in front of the computer before I go to work and then try to make some money, maybe like $10, $20, $50 here and there, and then leave and go to work. So I like the fact that I can do the trading in the morning and then go to my job. So that's what really appealed to me. And I think I tried a couple of other things too, but this trading ended up, you know, ended up as the one I focused on. I tried to punch out the things at the same time too, but ended up picking up focus. Got it. And was the focus on trading because you were finding success or was it because it was interesting to you or another reason? No, I definitely wasn't finding success in the beginning. So I'm glad you asked. But I just really liked it. Like I was really drawn to the idea that also like I was super young at the time, you know, I was in my early 20s, but I was super drawn to the fact that every single day is different in trading. I love that this news that happened overnight and change the older numbers on the screen and the colors, the green and the red, everything can change every single second. I think I just love the adrenaline and I love that's ever changing and it's not just like a typical, you know, office job where you do the same task every single day. So I was young, I was naive and I was stupid and I was hooked. That sounds right. I think that is exactly what goes for all of us. So I'm right there with you. And so then you started going through this process of doing your own homework, creating your watch list, waking up earlier so that you could prep for the market, finding your levels and how long were you doing this for? And is that still kind of what you're doing today or was there another pivot at some point beyond the pivot from small caps to mid and large cap stocks? That's a good question because I think my my process of pre-microplanning of, you know, looking for scanning for stocks to trade, reading the news and then creating my watch list has been pretty much very, very similar since that beginning stage. I kind of built the foundation from there and the small things changed here and there like the little details. But for the most part of my process, the big picture process has been the same for the last, I've been trading for 10 years, for the last seven years, it's been the same where I'm scanning for stocks and looking at the charts and looking at news and then I plan the individual plays or the potential trades that I'm going to trade. So for the most part, it's been the same even like after all these years. I see. Yeah, that makes a ton of sense. I think I find that too like once you kind of find your rhythm that it's pretty easy to to sustain it. So that I think that that makes a lot of sense especially with your approach. What what time frames during the day do you like to trade the most? Because I know at least from an option trading perspective, which is primarily what I do, there are different times of days that mean different things to me. And I'm wondering how you view the trading day. Yeah. So I usually start from looking at the daily charts. The daily is probably the timeframe in my opinion for my style is the most important. That's where I kind of have a general at these technical bias along with the news and all that of course. But daily chart is where I plan out most of my trades using the daily levels. You know, the higher days, the daily resistance, the 52 week highs, those are probably the most important levels I'll look at. And then once I have that information, then I'll take a look at the intraday charts. I'm using a lot of the five minute charts nowadays. So that's one small detail that changed from 10 years ago. I used to use a lot more one minute charts. Nowadays I use a five minute charts. And the shortest time frame I'll use is two minute charts. Got it. And do you wait those charts differently for different products or is the waiting about the same in terms of the time frames? Like if you're trading a mid cap stock versus a large cap stock, does the way you perceive those time frames carry over or does one get more weight than the other? Yeah. So we trade a lot of lower float small cap stocks. That's the kind of small cap stocks I would trade when I do trade them. So the lower the float and the smaller the market cap, the shorter time frame I go. So for those, usually I'll use a two minute chart. And then I'll look at five minutes as a reference. So anything under a billion dollars market cap, I will most likely be using a two minute time frame. And anything over a billion market cap, I'll be using the five minute or sometimes even the 15 minutes time frame. Got it. Yeah, I'm following you. Now we, you know we have to talk about this because you already spilled the beans that you tried trading options. You told me this when we had spoke. And as soon as I heard it, I was like, damn it. We were so close to converting another one. We were right there. And then it didn't work probably because of just call yo-lo's, I would guess, but we, yeah, yeah, them damn call yo-lo's. So we have to talk about the options because I got to tell you one of my long term roadmaps is like maybe over the next like 30 years. I'm just going to slowly try to move you towards options. Just a little bit. Maybe so that whenever we catch up once in a while, you're like, well, I got one trade on that'll, that'll be a big win for us out there. So I'm working on converting you at least to a degree. But to start the conversion, I need to understand the history with the product. So when did, when did you first stumble into options and how did it go? Yeah. So, take a guess. What do you think is the first kind of options trading style or approach I took? I would have to. I would have to guess out of the money calls. And I would guess shorter term expiration. I don't know what catalyst you would choose because one of the interesting thing about options is a lot of the small cap stocks you might have been trading at the time. They might not even have options. So that part I don't have a good read on. But that would be my my first level guess is that you're using further out of the money options because they're a cheaper and they can compound more and not going too far out in time because they're cheaper by not going too far out in time. That's the guess. Yeah, you're close. I was waiting at zero DTEs. I was trying to scalp those. So about as short as you can go. Got it. Yeah. Yeah. To shorten my time frame even more. Oh my god. Yeah. It was so wild. So especially on Fridays, I used to so I at this point, I was still in a chat room. But the way I used to chat room was very different. I'm just trying to see what other people's ideas are. And I'll see if there's anything I can trade out of their ideas like my own strategies. But in the same chat room, there's like an options chat room. So the stuff they're doing seems extremely intriguing. You take these options, options contracts at only 50 cents. And then if it hits, it can hit 500% in one day. So that's kind of what attracted me. And at this point, I was still already finding some success in trading stocks. So I just decided that, you know, oh, let me try this options thing on the side. Why not? So I kind of just kind of took a course in options trading. And then I started trading these zero DTEs right away. And then a lot of the instruments I was trading were just like spy. Especially like you said, the yellow calls, expiring the same week or sometimes the same day. I remember trading a lot of Tesla when Tesla was really really hot in 2016, 2017. That was really fun. But I don't think I ever made money from from zero DTEs. I'll make money here and there. But then when I lose money, I'll lose 100% of it. Right. So that kind of just cancels out everything. But it was fun. I'll say that. But also one of my blowups after one of my blowups into my year four was because of options trading because of the zero DTEs. That's interesting that you blew up that way too, because I assume you were buying options. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yeah. So to me, I actually find the idea of blowing up your buying options difficult because your max loss is defined at entry. So were you just sizing things like a gregiously large or what happened there? No, but it makes it kind of makes sense because when I lose, I lose 100% of it. And sure, why make money? I'm not I'm not I wasn't that good. So it's not like I'm making money like a thousand percent, five hundred percent all the time. Well, sometimes when I make money, it could be 50% 40% less, maybe you have one or two, a couple hundred percent or a thousand percent. But I think in the long run, my win rate for the zero DTE trade was just so low that no, the older 100% losses on those trades cancels out everything and more. I see. Okay. So when you're saying, okay, I took blowup to be more of like a kinetic event like in a single day, big move, knocked us out, but it sounds more like you like over time. There was an erosion that essentially zeroed the account out. Yes. Yes. Okay. Got it. Yeah. The breaks my heart because whatever course you took that sent you into zero DTEs, we need to have a conversation with that course director, whoever that is and be like, what what are we doing here? But okay. And then I ran anymore. I think. Yeah, you don't say. Tell me more. I'm blown away that that could possibly be the case. Well, I think I still think for the way that you trade now, that options could be really good. But it would, I think you would have to change the way that you think about them and the way you use them. But we'll see. That'll be that'll be a future project where maybe I can slowly start subliminally messaging like long calls and short calls and maybe get you trading some volatility in there. I don't know. We'll see. Just send me those alerts. You know, that's it. I forgot. I just need to do alerts. How annoying is that? How annoying is that when people ask about, are you going to do alerts? Does that bother you? Yeah. It does. Like I'm like, why would you want that upon yourself to have to kind of have to kind of grow a dependency on someone else holding you what to do? It's your money. Like you need to be able to make the decisions for yourself. I almost feel offended for them when they ask you those things. The part that I always find so funny about it is I think a lot of us get into trading for the idea of making money so that then you achieve financial freedom. And then you, exactly as you say, you tie it, your financial freedom is now predicated on this other person again. It's essentially just having a boss again. I find that connection to be pretty funny. But it's still ironic too. Yeah. It is. Well, the pursuit of easy money is always a learning to everybody. It's why so many people will go play the lottery, right? Even though from a probability standpoint, it's not necessarily a great way. People will still do it. So yeah, I can always see there being a group like that. When you look at your community that you've built, how have they evolved alongside your evolution of trading? Have they broadly moved with you? Do they do a lot of different things? But there's crossover. How does that work for your people? Yeah, that's a good question because I will say most people who join in the first place in that, say that first month and it's understandable. Most of you are more clueless. They kind of need a guidance. So they are more likely the beginners, the new new community members. They're more likely to kind of try to do exactly how I teach them the strategies. Like we have video lessons. They're joining. They'll try to do everything like by the book and copy exactly what I'm looking for, which is great. I rather them do that than to try to like figure out zero DTEs or try to trace stocks. But I think in the beginning, most people are going to be very by the book. Oh, that's say I'm looking for, I'm saying, oh, in the strategy, look for 20% gap, they'll do exactly that. And I think that's fine. But I think gradually, you know, most traders and most members, after at least three or six months of very intensive learning and trading, they start to develop their own way of thinking. They start to change the strategy. I teach them to kind of modify to change and then to fit their own style. So maybe make strategy. The first one I taught them was, you know, a little bit too conservative. Maybe they decide that, hey, like, instead of risking 2%, I want to risk 5%. So but then by that time, it's up to them. They have the proper foundation. They know the tools and they have the knowledge. You kind of tweak the strategies, tweak the criteria, tweak the scanners to fit what works the best for them according to their risk tolerance. So in the beginning, everyone's not going to be by the book trying to copy exactly what you say in the video lessons. But at the end, you know, after a year, after two years, they usually develop their own style and they know exactly what they're looking for. And now a lot of the people who's been here for a while, I'm asking for their ideas. I'm asking to see what they're looking at because I know by now how they trade, they have almost like a different strategy after old, old as time. So it's kind of the reverse now. I would try to like pick the brain and try to see what they're looking at and see if there's anything I can use in my own strategies and try to apply my own thing to make money. So that's the thing I love about trading. You can be very flexible, and you can make things your own. Yeah. Well, it's also cool that you guys create an environment for that because like we were talking about in the beginning, I actually think that's probably one of the most defining features of somebody that can be successful at this long term is doing exactly that. It's taking the time to like build something that makes sense for them. When you look over your trading career, what are some of the things that you used to do that as you think about it? You're like, why would I ever do that? But you did. What kind of things like that exists for you? Yeah. I think in the very beginning, I was very opposed to trading the mega caps, like the apples, the Amazon, the Google, the Nvidia. At the time, it didn't make sense because it felt like a very well, you trade options. I feel like you might agree with this. It felt like a very inefficient way of using your capital, right? That's Nvidia's now like what, what was it? $140 or something like that? If I traded, I'll probably have to, like $140, at the time, I was trading a small account. I couldn't afford that many shares to make money. So I can probably take what 50 shares and then try to try to make a dollar to dollars from that. This is day trading. So at the time, it doesn't make sense that why would anyone want to trade that? But I think now, I'm more open to the idea and actually prefer trading the big caps over the small caps because they are a lot more, in my opinion, at least in today, they're a lot more predictable. They kind of follow trends a certain way. And there are certain chart patterns and price action that you just see repeatedly again, again, in all these mega cap stocks. So now I'm more, a lot more open to the idea of let's just say trading and video, the actual stock and something like Apple, Amazon, where you then Tesla, like I'll trade them. I'll take the extra shares. Got it. That's really interesting. When you're deciphering the predictability of something like mega cap versus another size company, are you running like a broad style analysis or is it kind of pattern built in by seeing and you're just looking at it every day? And that's how you're building your understanding of the relationship with some of these patterns. Yeah. So I used to study a lot of charts. I still do, but obviously not as intensive as I did the first four years. So I used to save charts and now I'll analyze, I'll save a different timeframes. We talked about like one minute, one minute chart, daily chart, five minute charts. So I used to save those charts, but all the stocks I've traded. And it's not like I memorized a pattern, but over time, you kind of start seeing some similar trend and some similar patterns. That's a, the morning setup looks a certain way on the five minute charts and there's negative news in the market. You know, there's certain things that you can't predict them or guarantee it 100% all the time, but there's certain things that you start to see that, hey, like maybe I can, I can, you know, you just educate a guest and then try to build a strategy around, you know, when the chart sets up this way, when it gaps up and sells off to the middle of the day, what's likely going to happen. So a lot to answer your questions, a lot of that is just based on past experience and seeing the same charts and the same price action over and over again. So a lot of observation time. Yeah. It's, yeah. That's one of the things that always fascinated me with like pattern style trading because I, I tend to apply a bit of a quantitative approach with a practical approach. I'm like a middle ground between something like what you would do versus what like a quant would do. I'm like the, the, I don't know, I'm kind of like the idiot that does both and not that great. That's really what it was down to. So it's kind of cool that you've picked a specific learning modality that is really connected for you when you're looking at these different patterns and stuff, especially when it comes to short term trading time frames. There's, there's a million of them. You see so many people talk about all of these different kinds of candlestick pattern setups, price levels, stuff like that. How did you start to navigate to like what worked for you? How did you find that? Because one of the things I'm trying to strike at here is when you're first starting, if you're trying to find something that works, you try it for two weeks, it doesn't work, and then you dump it. That might have been the right thing, but you just might not have tried it for long enough. So I feel like that's a really difficult balance to strike, and obviously you found a way to navigate that. So can you talk us through it? Yeah, I think that's a, that's a, that's a common question. I see a lot as well, but I think usually when people ask me that, well, like a lot of those are actually my members in my community. When they say that to me, I'm like, okay, show me your journal. Show me the charts. Show me the charts to save. That's the end. And then they usually say, oh, I don't have it. So, so a lot of times you might be trying, they might be trying that that said strategy or that said chart pattern or that said set up for two weeks, but when they don't actually journal it down and save the charts, then I don't think that's, I don't think you are actually testing and testing the strategy the right way when you are not recording actual data. So, so the way I look at it is, at this you need at these, you know, 50 sample size of those trades and everything needs to be journaled and then the charts need to be saved. And then for you to go back and actually look at, okay, like, is it me or is it a strategy? You know, I think, I think people have to kind of answer that question themselves, honestly. So that's how I kind of start to navigate building setup is from saving tons of charts, whether it's the actual strategies that traded or the ones I missed by didn't trade, I still see a similar setup. I'll save it. I'll collect a bunch of sample sizes of a particular strategy that I think, hey, there might be a pattern there or there might be a strategy here that that's repeatable. Start with collecting charts. And then I used to be very, very big into spreadsheets. So I'll spreadsheet everything. That's a, you know, the smoke cap stock when it gaps up over 50%. You know, it's likely to have like an old day fade and I'll track the success of that and how, what's a percentage of the fade can be? You know, I'm saying like, when a stock gaps up, we're talking about just smoke cap stocks. What's the probability of this happening? And I'll even track it by months. So, you know, during some of months, the probabilities like 30% was lower during the winter and the fall and the spring, the probabilities a lot higher. So I use to track everything. So that's how I start to build at these some sense of, okay, pattern recognition in which I call this actual valuable data collection, actual valuable information as opposed to just trying to set up for two weeks, thinking you actually tried the strategy, but in fact, you didn't record any of it. I hope this makes sense. It makes it, it makes a ton of sense. It makes a ton of sense because I find people do that with a ton of things across trading where they have hazardly tried something. There's no record to actually refer what the outcomes were. And there, there, those kinds of things are so prone to path. And that's kind of what I was highlighting by talking that through with you because if you try something for two weeks and then you just bail on it, that thing might have worked, but you don't have a good record to be able to say objectively, yes or no, and you might not have let it try long enough. Now, going back to the broader question though, when you first started trading like these different setups and patterns, how did you call through the thousands that are there and say, I'm going to try these 15, these 10, these five, whatever and see how these work. And then how did you narrow that down? Because when I think about the prospects of day trading via some sort of like candlestick patterns or just price behavior on an intraday time frame, I think that's probably one of the most common things I see people talk about is like, how do you pick? Are you going to use a doji or you're going to use the hammers? Like they use all the individual candles then setups of candles like the three of three down like all those kinds of things. How did you sift through the broad universe of intraday patterns into the things you thought were worth testing and then from there, how did you narrow that down further? So I think there's two aspects to this question. The first one is I don't actually, I know Kenno State patterns and chart patterns are, I don't people use that interchangeably, but I don't actually use the candlestick patterns like oh, shooting star, like I don't actually use that, but I look at the bigger picture like what the entire day chart look like where they has higher lows. I look at that and what the trend looks like. So I'm more, I'm also looking at candlestick trends than the individual candlestick patterns. But when that's my style of looking at charts, but when I look at the entire chart, I feel like I can see a bigger picture. Now where does that initial inspiration come from? Well, it comes from like the initial when I was in the chat rooms and I took a lot of courses. While the chat room alerts don't work, I do believe in like some of the educations that taught you, even though you cannot just like I say, you cannot take someone's strategy and kind of completely copy and make it, make it work for you. A lot of times you can be inspired by it. And even if it doesn't work for you at the end, you can be inspired by it and look at the chart that maybe perhaps somebody is doing a did by strategy. Even if that actual execution, execution or strategy doesn't work for me, I look at it charts. I look at the chart patterns that talking about what the daily chart looks like, what the intraday looks like. And then I'll start seeing that, okay, like, you know, even though I cannot execute the trades, like he was she taught me to, I can still trade the same chart in my own way. So that's what I mean by I was really inspired by a lot of the common chart patterns the small cap traders use. Some common ones are like the first green day, the first red day, or like the parabolic charts. Those are really, really common chart patterns with very similar appearances in the daily charts all the time for small cap stocks. And then from there, I kind of just kind of start building my own kind of executions. And then talk me through how those executions translated into what you trade now. So before you're looking at first green day, first red day, parabolic moves, what has that turned into and what have you noticed about what applies to small caps and may or may not apply to larger mega caps? Yeah. So I mean, I think I it's better if I pick like a like a specific kind of chart, like a specific strategy. So there's a I can pull a chart up if you want. Sure. Let me think what's a good one. We can look at here go. Okay, we can look at let's say and video. This is not a really good example. We can look at SMCI. And then what time frame do you like? Uh, deity. And then what do you call back to um, mid February until February 16. So from early February to February 16, 2024 on the deity. Oh, daily candles got that deity candles. Yeah. Got it. Oh, that's actually really cool that you do that. And then you said February. Mm hmm. Oh, one. I bet. You can do February first. I think February first till just you can or you can just do the entire February if it's easier. Got it. Yes. So I have February first until today. Okay. Sweet. And then I have us on a daily and then I can get rid of this this crap. These are just moving averages. If it's too noisy, I can dump them. But okay. So the the chart I want to focus on is the early February where you can see like this consecutive green candles when the stock went from 400 to a thousand dollars in like what two weeks or so. So you see all those straight up green candles. So when I see that on the daily chart, whether it's a small cap or a large cap, like we call this like a parabolic deity chart when the stock just goes up and up and up with very little pullback every single day. And so number one, why I see that I know that okay, like short sellers are getting squeezed. You know, we saw some similar patterns for GameStop, for the Tesla years ago, short sellers are getting squeezed. And every single day the dips are getting bought back up. So I know that the shorts are in pain. But at the same time, you know, we also know that eventually, you know, I say eventually, there will be a huge red day to pullback because in terms of price action, this is like, you know, a lot of irrational buying and also a lot of the a lot of the buying is from short sellers covering on the way up. We're talking about all the parabolic green candles. So there's a couple ways to play this when, you know, as crazy and as dangerous as the sounds, a lot of times with these kind of parabolic deity charts, we do what I do, I say the trend join long. I'll try to join a trend and intraday out, I'll keep buying on the way up because I know shorts are getting squeezed. I'll try to do that on like the third or the fourth day, green candle. And a lot of times I'll swing them even like after a day, try to swing them into those huge, you can see like, you know, nearly and the candles stay between in between the the last three green candles before the huge red candle. There's a huge gap in between. So this is how you know, like a stock is like taking off. Like it's already going parabolic when there's a huge gap in between the candles. And there's going to be a huge red day coming soon. It could be the next three days, four days, five days. But then if, you know, I will take the longs during those intraday and try to like take advantage of those huge moves. That's when, you know, the the the the the ATR, the sorry, the average to range of a stock can increases a lot intraday, the range of the stock. So I'll go long during those. I call the trend join long when I see this kind of daily candles. And then a lot of traders, small caps or large caps, they'll time that huge red candle. So the first red day, the reason is called the first red days because you have multiple days of green candle going into it. So there hasn't been a huge pullback at all since, you know, this is what February first was February second. So the stock has been green for the last two weeks straight. So when there's a red candle, that candle is going to be huge. So usually when we try to short those when once the stock is actually red on the day, then I'll short those knowing that the downside is a lot greater because the stock has been so extended, right? It's like polling a rubber band when you stretch it so far for so many days and you just so intense and there's just so much buying tight in the stock. When you finally you release the rubber band finally, it's going to snap all the way over and I get overextended to a downside. So then what time and try to trade a short day when there is a short day confirmed, then you just join it to the downside this time. You just short it all the way down a lot of times you get like a pullback for two or three days. So then now be the other side of the trade once the the parabolic breakout move is done, then you try to I try to trade the first red day. But you know, the patterns that we look at we start from a date and they I'll trade it today. What's really funny is I have to be honest with you, I didn't expect this, but you and I look at some of the same things and we do, but we trade them slightly differently. So for stuff like this, I have kind of different scans that count consecutive updates. Essentially soon as there's three or above, it adds it to a list and then I rank it by gaps between them. Okay. And I look for a very similar and it's funny. I call it the same thing a parabolic up move. And I'll trade those with options though, but I typically don't try to do it in today, but I normally will try to run it over a timeframe for your perspective. It looks like some of these intraday periods would be much more lucrative than others. Is there a way that you kind of screen how strong you think the day might be for a move as compared to something else? Because I look at these and these are kind of like little boring days, probably not well, I guess that is a big candle. Maybe this one's a better example. And you know, it's a smaller overall day as compared to stuff like this that have just much bigger moves. Do you wait them in some way? Do you have some sort of predictive tool that you try to analyze what you think that up move might look like for the day? Yeah, I keep it extremely simple. The day I'm trading it as a today's Friday, then today's open and today's lower day needs to be higher than yesterday's higher day. So the stock needs to have already opened and traded above the higher day from the day before. So the candles you're pointing at those tiny ones, I wouldn't be trading those because they're under yesterday's highs. Got it. Yep. So the high was here. This one opened it look like super close to it. This one you definitely wouldn't have touched. This one you wouldn't have touched. And then this is this typically then what do you think you'd be entering in like something like in here? Yes. Yeah. Once the one's a stock breaks above yesterday's right? Yeah. Got it. And then when you're looking for the short, it sounds like this one is a little bit more of a carry trade for you. Less of an intraday thinks you said typically there's successive days that follow that is there a reason why you trade this over a couple days and not to try to hold this for a couple day move? Or is it this one you're just expecting to trade it intraday? Anyways, capture most of the move. And then this one you have some sort of data that infers once this happens, it's overwhelmingly probabilistic going to be a continuation move of some sort. Yeah. So I'm trying to kind of adapt a little bit more now. Before the long side and short side for both of those, I will only swing it and keep it for a couple of days. If I like I would open a start or trade as a day trade. And then I'll close it and look at the chart and see whether there might be more the next day. And now it may be like save like a quarter of my day trade into the next couple of days. I see. So that's how I usually do things, but I'm trying to kind of try to maximize the trade with a separate swing trading account. Now I kind of open a new account in the middle of the year. So that one I want to start to maximize it and just strictly do day trade. So swing trades in that account. Yeah. I love that because one of the things I think about especially is your highlighting, which makes a lot of sense to me with the way that you're playing the parabolic move, but the point that I would be curious about is the gaps that you would miss. Because a lot of these moves and it's from I run it through Python. So I have like a really large data set, depending on the kind of product and the behavior when it starts moving into these parabolic up moves. And to me, that seems like a really strong return source for you potentially. So that's cool that you're kind of tinkering with that. I love that. You think of it that way. That's super cool. Thank you so much for walking through some of this stuff. I love learning and sharing different approaches to markets. That's kind of some of the coolest parts about this. Yeah. And like it's really cool that we both see the same chart. We just describe it. And maybe we use both say parabolic, but maybe in the beginning, you didn't really understand what I was talking about until we see the same chart that we know all what's talking about the exact same chart. I have to like I did not expect that. I really didn't. I thought that you would be looking for completely different things than I typically do. And then as soon as you pointed that out, I was like that this is actually kind of nuts because there's like heavy crossover there. Even the way that you play the down move is fascinating to me. I play that a little differently. Not in terms of following the trend down. I'll do that. But I don't use strategies that capitalize on the down moves as much. So you've actually given me some homework. Believe it or not, to take a look at the probability of the big red day and the size of the move on those. So thank you for thank you for the homework. Oh, worries. A couple of last questions for you. So I think one of the coolest things that traders that have been in the game for a while can do is to just share not necessarily some of their biggest mistakes. There's a million of those all over the place. But the thing I like to try to explore with people are some of the things that you learned and think other people should know that are not talked about that much. Do you have anything like that that comes to mind for you in your path? Yeah. So that's also another reason I'm trying to swing trade more this year and even open the new account because I do feel like day traders for the most part would leave a lot of money on the table. So I agree with what you said before. You can maximize it more. So that's the one part I'm really trying to work on this year and next year. I do think that there are a lot of times where you know, yeah, day trading, you can make a lot of money, but for certain chart patterns like the one we just talked about, you know, you can make even more with swing trading. We just obviously with swing trading, I would be more selective and only swing trade when I see you know, certain very, very good setups. I think just day trading wouldn't do it justice. So I think that's a part that I'm trying to learn more and improve on this year. And I don't think I mean, I don't think I am allowed to say that, oh, I have it figured out, I'll have it figured out in terms of maximizing my swing trading. But I think just the fact that this year, I'm really trying to work on turning some really good day trades into swing trades. I think that's a good start. But I know I'm not by no means am I an expert in swing trading. I think that's awesome. And I think more than anything, you're sharing such an important mindset, which is evolution, right? Like you've been trading for over a decade now and you were talking about that and the way you do things. And I have to say that's just another pure commonality I find between those of us that tend to trade for a long time is we constantly are looking for other ways we can do things. Like you gave me an idea in this one, right? Like that's the whole point is that we're always looking for different things. So I'm actually really stoked about the swing training component. And I am eager to hear your results because I have some ideas on what we'll see and I think it'll be good to be honest. So I'm excited for that. The last question I have for you is I know that the the Lamborghini is a big part of your brand, right? Like we have the Lamborghini microphone. I don't even know what those things are called. The little microphone cover thing. You know how much like the thing is. Yeah, the song thing. Yeah, I guess maybe so people hit themselves on the face or something crazy. But anyways, I love the joke around the Lamborghini, but I am a car guy and I love McLaren's. So I'm wondering if I can find a way to send you a McLaren thing and maybe once in a while I could get a guest appearance on the mic thing. We can try. I mean, I don't know. I have McLaren's like supposedly better than Lamborghini. I don't know cars. So it's one of those things that like better is such a strange thing. It's like, they're all so over that I have them. I have them. I love them. But like it's all just so over the top. It's all bullshit. So I wouldn't call one inherently better than the other. It's kind of like none of us that are buying them. I run a car club. So like I love driving and stuff like that. But not a professional driver. So you could have somebody that's probably a professional driver beat me in a Honda Civic. So you know, it's I think it's more about what style you like. But anyways, I am curious. I have to see if I can find one of those little microphone cover things and see if I can get just just a one guest stand in would be great. That would be pretty cool. Yeah, if you can find that I would love to feature a McLaren. Perfect. Well, I love that. I'll keep that door open. This is good. I mean, this is a great win for my side of the deal because I'm going to slowly pressure you. Hopefully more and more to looking at options. And then maybe we get them clearing out there. So I call it a great victory across the board. But it's time for you to run. And I am just so appreciative for you to come hang out for a while, especially because you really do bring such a different perspective. And my hands down favorite thing about you. It's what drew me to you in the first place is that I find that there are so few genuine voices in this space. And it's very cool to find one that I would consider to be very genuine. So thanks for doing everything that you do. And thanks for coming to hang out for a while. Thanks Eric. Yeah, that was fun conversation. I promise at some point I will promise to properly look at options and give those shots. I can promise you that. That's the only issue. Let me know whenever you do, I'll literally jump on a call with you. And I will hold your hand all the way through it to make sure that it's not a bad experience because I think especially for your style of trading, they really could be very cool. But yeah, we'll have to tinker with them. Thank you so much for your time. And then for people that want to find you, like I said, I'll throw your website and all of your other social media handles in the description. Is there anywhere else that you want to direct people to or anything like that? I think just my YouTube, Instagram, my website, socials, all that good stuff is good. Perfect. So you guys can check all of that out in the description below. Thanks everybody for hanging out, being outlier. And we'll see you guys later.
