0.00s: What's up everyone? Welcome back to the Outlier podcast. I have my friend, Shay from Humboldt
7.36s: Trader. I'll throw a link to all of her stuff in the description below, but we're reconnecting
13.28s: because I was out visiting her in Vancouver a couple months ago for a podcast and really
18.20s: enjoyed the conversation. And I think your approach to markets from what I can tell is
23.84s: really interesting. One of the things I try to do with my podcast is to put different
28.40s: approaches in front of people because one of my stances on trading is such a big component
33.84s: of it is finding something that aligns with you and like your personality and like what
38.48s: makes sense for the way you think about the world and markets. And I think you offer a really
42.80s: cool perspective. So thanks for coming to hang out. Thanks for having me, Eric. It's an honor
47.12s: to be on your podcast. It's a blast. So first of all, I have to ask when the summer kept
56.40s: running out there, when I was in Vancouver, it was gorgeous. Is it still like that or does
61.84s: it start getting like super humid and stuff? It's it's gotten hotter now. But it's doesn't
69.68s: ever get humid here. It's really dry here on the west coast. So it's actually really,
74.48s: really nice out like if you like the beach, if you like a beach weather, like that's this
78.56s: like a perfect time in Vancouver. Oh, that's awesome. Yeah, when I was out there, I was so stoked
83.20s: with the weather and I was curious if it starts heating up a ton. So speaking of heating up,
88.72s: I you primarily trade small caps, or not necessarily like penny stocks or anything like that,
93.44s: but not not large cap. You're primarily like day trading small cap stocks. Is that correct?
98.16s: Actually, in the recent years, I trade more of the mid caps and larger cap stocks.
104.16s: And then I'll dabble into the small caps when I see really good opportunities. Maybe like
109.84s: a couple of times a month. Got it. And just for my understanding, how do you define mid cap?
115.92s: What market cap falls into there? Well, I kind of categorize large cap, mid cap, all together.
120.80s: Anything over a billion market cap, I kind of trade them a certain way. And then anything
125.20s: under I trade it as just small caps. Got it. Yeah. Then I see how you're breaking it down there.
130.72s: And so what do you make of the recent market activity? We've been selling off for a couple
136.00s: days now. How does that impact your approach? Yeah. So this year, at least for me, what's
143.84s: being working really well for me has just been going long on the large cap stocks. So when the
148.96s: markets are selling off, honestly, they should be told it's hard for me to find setups I really
154.32s: want to trade. So the last couple of days, I just kind of been sitting on the sidelines, I scalped
159.92s: here and there, really, really short term. But I'm honestly just like, you know, looking and
166.72s: looking and waiting for the right opportunities to get back in. So when the market sells off,
172.24s: I'm just kind of on the sidelines. I don't really short sell large caps that much this year.
178.24s: I got them burnt in the beginning of the year. So that's why even though we have short term
182.88s: pullback, like right now, I'm still just, you know, re-empatients and waiting for the right opportunities.
188.80s: Got it. Yeah. And another question I had with your approach specifically is,
195.04s: what's your methodology for identifying like these market turnovers? Because I imagine you trade
202.48s: typically shorter term time frames. So that's one of the benefits, you know, perceivably in terms of
209.36s: the purpose of day trading, you're supposed to be able to catch these kinds of capitulations.
212.96s: What's your approach to doing that? Yeah. So like you said, the benefit is overnight, we don't have
219.12s: any exposure, unless I'm doing some swing trading. But most of the time I'm day trading and,
224.40s: you know, overnight, I don't really have to worry about anything. So if I wake up, I see everything's
229.44s: gapping down, you know, continuing to sell off like the last two days, I would look at things and
235.92s: wait for maybe two hours to see if there's a reversal to get in. But if not, then, you know,
242.96s: it doesn't really affect me. So that's one of the benefits of day trading. I don't really have
247.76s: to time anything. I see. Yeah. Yeah. The reason why I kind of dove straight into methodology from the
254.56s: jump is just because I thought the market activity's been interesting. And I want to dive more into the
259.28s: way you think about it later. But to take us a couple steps back now, I would love to understand
266.48s: the way that you entered markets. Because when you and I spoke, you'd mention that you've tried a
272.40s: few different things. And even now you've mentioned that you've tried a few different things. So
276.64s: walk me through when you started trading and then kind of a evolution after that.
284.48s: Yeah. I went first kind of learned about what trading is was 10 years ago. I went first
291.28s: graduated from college. And in the beginning, you know, I just wanted like fast money, right? I
297.28s: saw the ads for penny stocks. So back then, my first introduction was like OTC stocks, penny stocks.
304.64s: And we're talking about the stocks are literally two or three cents. So that's my very beginning. I was
310.56s: trying to buy pump and dumps and then eventually learn to short sell the pump and dump stocks.
317.28s: So that's kind of my first introduction. And then gradually, I realized that, you know, small caps
323.20s: and penny stocks, they're kind of extremely cyclical. Stock market is cyclical in nature,
328.32s: but for the smaller cap stocks, even more so. Sometimes the cycles can rotate really fast in the
334.56s: matter of a couple of days or even weeks. So at least in the very beginning, I was a trader,
341.44s: you're supposed to wait for your opportunity. But for beginners, like they think, when I did,
347.04s: I thought so too. I thought I can come in every single day and there will be the same kind of
352.24s: opportunities every single day, the same strategy. So I thought it's literally just rinse and repeat
357.52s: and trying to, you know, make money print. So that's what I got burnt a lot in the beginning. Maybe
364.24s: I'll have one good day where the market fits what I'm trying to trade. But next two or three days,
370.24s: I shouldn't have traded at all, but I still kept on trying to make things happen, trying to squeeze
376.96s: water out of rocks and then I'll just lose everything. So that's when I started to think about,
383.36s: okay, maybe I should venture into small sorry, mid caps and large cap stocks and kind of learn,
389.44s: you know, a variety of different strategies that I can and four different stocks. So I can have
395.20s: maybe, you know, instead of just one or two approach, I can have a playbook of five or six
400.64s: different strategies to play with depending on the sentiment of the market.
405.84s: I see. Now walk me through the time you spent in each of those stages. So the time that you started
413.36s: with OTC and then kind of thereafter. Yeah. So to be honest, my timing when I was actually trading
421.60s: the penny stocks and the in the small cap stocks in the very beginning, I was just following chat room
426.80s: alerts. Perfect. It's not really trading. So, you know, I'm sure you know, right? I know, I know. But like,
433.28s: you know, you join those chat rooms and I'm literally just waiting for a text alerts.
438.48s: And I'll try to buy the same stocks as whatever the person is trying to tell people to buy. And he
443.68s: got in a dollar. I tried to buy the same stock. I got in at 140 and he sold at 150 and then
450.40s: when I sell for some reason, the stocks back down to like 110 or a dollar. So that's honestly the
458.08s: very beginning stages of my trading career if you even call that career. That brutal. I know. But I
465.36s: feel like it's a hard lesson, but everyone needs to go through that to kind of understand that,
471.84s: hey, you kind of need to take this very seriously. Yeah. Kind of like, you know, a give rich quick scheme.
478.32s: Well, it's funny for a few reasons too, because one of the first things you mentioned was the idea
483.20s: of like fast money. And that is like one of the underpinning features that brings all of us to the
491.28s: markets. That's why I started trading, right? Like all of us start this with this idea of like fast
496.64s: money. And then the longer you you're around the game, the more you realize, like, yeah, like you
502.72s: can make a lot of money trading, but I wouldn't call it fast money. It's kind of money that's, you
508.32s: know, earned over time. And then you got it. Then you got to keep it. But yeah, I really
513.68s: commiserate with that. And then the other thing I was laughing about is when you were talking about
517.44s: like the the alert service funny enough, like I didn't even know what those were. I found out what
522.16s: they were like two years ago, because somebody on my, somebody yes, because the way that I trade
529.04s: is completely different. I'm like in a vacuum. I'm just looking at my stuff. I really don't care
533.68s: what anybody else is doing. Like I just do my stuff. And so anyways, somebody on the YouTube
538.80s: channel, they reached out to me and they were like, Hey, you know, what do you think of like these
542.00s: trade that this like trading room or whatever? And I was I literally was just like, what the hell is
546.96s: that? And long story short, I ended up doing like a couple of videos where like I paid to enter
552.40s: these rooms just to see what they were like. And I'm like, this is crazy. Like they call each other
558.64s: analysts. And I'm like, this is nuts. Yeah. So then I made a couple videos just honestly
566.32s: tearing them to shreds because it was dumbest stuff I've ever seen. But yeah, that's I think it's
572.08s: really topical though that that's one of the things you tried. I actually think that's a fantastic
576.64s: experience for you because it let's you actually. Yeah. Because I feel like it lets you become so
582.00s: much closer to the people because that's what most people are doing now, which is kind of fascinating
586.80s: to me. So then talked to me about the pivot from there. So you're you're buying your your penny
591.44s: stocks for $1.40 and then you're the alert dudes getting out of there at 150 and then you're like
597.92s: sick. Let me exit mine and you're like, Okay, well, I lost money on this. This isn't that fun.
602.08s: So then what led the transition from there? Yeah. So it's just from a lot of losses like in a
609.84s: big ending, I blew up a couple of different accounts, the smaller accounts. They're like a $2,000,
614.96s: $3,000 here and there. So I lost it all. But in the meantime, even though I lost all the money,
623.76s: they were also a couple of times where I actually made money. So that's why I still feel very
629.36s: encouraged at hey, like it's it is possible to make money. But maybe I'm just not putting in enough
636.08s: effort to kind of get to kind of understand the process and actually give it like a real shot at
642.32s: trading. I feel I realize that you can make money. So some of those, you know, dreams that's
647.92s: being sold online. Some of that is true. Like that you say, you can make a lot of money. But my
653.68s: approach to this is just incorrect. So I realize that, you know, maybe like into like six months or
660.16s: a year, then that's where I started to put in some real effort. And actually some of the things,
666.48s: the things that I did, I really changed things around for me. The first one is building my own
671.84s: watch list. So when I said I was in the chat rooms, I got wake up at 6.30 a.m. My local time here.
678.32s: So that will be 9.30 a.m. I used to wake up at market time, market open and then think I can
684.16s: just trade based on the alerts, right? So I don't do that anymore. So I decided that hey, I need to
689.36s: wake up earlier. So I'll wake up at least an hour earlier before the market opens and I actually
694.32s: build my own watch list. So that's a that's a huge difference. Even just looking at up your own
700.32s: tickers, planning your own stuff in your own levels. Like that's that's that's a huge step in
705.36s: the right direction. And you know, it's it's kind of what differentiates a lot of the, you know,
711.12s: the we call them like the sheep or like the followers who just wait for the chat room alerts. That's a
717.12s: you're kind of starting to become more self-sufficient and planning your own trades and kind of
722.56s: start to start thinking about the trades and the thesis by yourself. So that's a huge step in the
728.88s: right direction in my opinion at a time. And then the second thing I did was I start to, you know,
734.40s: manage risk more intentionally. They got playing out my risk along with my watch list before I
741.36s: enter a stock. I'm playing out. Oh, if I can, you know, if I allow myself to risk $20, you know,
748.40s: in the stock, you know, for this one, I have to risk $20. That means I can only take a certain
753.44s: amount of shares. So all of those would brand new to me at a time. But it seems so
758.64s: simple and so easy now. But back then, I think most traders don't know you're supposed to do those
764.80s: things for yourself. Most people just want to follow and just want to make money right away. Is
771.12s: they doing the real work that's required of them? So you kind of started then saying, okay, I'm
778.48s: late to the punch on these. This isn't working that great. I'm going to try looking at this stuff
782.72s: myself. One of the parts that fascinates me so much about your path is that you've really
788.40s: still stayed centric on the same timeframes. You said that you swing trade sometimes, but like,
794.48s: you still, it sounds like at that point, it was still mostly day trading focused. Is that correct?
799.20s: Okay. Yes. And what has led you to really focus on day trading still up until this point? We've
807.04s: started with looking for fast money. We started with small stocks, accessible penny stocks. You don't
811.68s: need a lot of money. Then you're at this phase now where you're really starting to get into the
816.00s: nuts and bolts of doing this thing. And you still favor the short term timeframes. Why was that?
821.36s: Yeah. That's a very good question. Because one of the things I realized early on is that I need to
827.84s: focus on trying to learn one thing really well in any given time. So while I did kind of like
836.56s: dabble into swing trading or even options trading here and there, I realized that I wasn't good at
842.64s: those things really, really quick. And I should just focus on the one thing that I'm trying to get
847.44s: better at, which is day trading one or two different strategies. So that's one of the also another
854.00s: pretty important moments for me because most people and I did this too when we first started,
860.32s: we're just kind of jump left and right and trying out different strategies that people are talking
864.88s: about on Reddit in the chat rooms on X or Twitter. And then you kind of abandon your original,
872.88s: your craft or the project or the strategy that you are studying in the first place.
877.52s: So I figured out that, you know, in one of that kind of jump ship and chase the next shiny
882.96s: object, I kind of lose focus and kind of have to go back to the beginning all over the again.
888.80s: So that's why I decided, hey, I just want to focus on day trading. And you know, don't worry about
893.76s: swing trading. Don't worry about options trading for now. I just want to get really good at this
899.28s: one thing and one thing only. I love that. I think that that's a really interesting way in
906.00s: looking at it. And that's a, I think a really important point for people actually. I'm so stoked
911.36s: that you hit that because you that I think we've all done that where you kind of bounce between
917.28s: things and you don't have much to show for it, which is always frustrating. When you started getting
923.36s: into trading, what led you into trading specifically? So you were looking for fast money,
929.04s: but there's other ways to get fast money. You could be a drug dealer. You could smell people,
934.56s: right? There's lots of careers. What led to trading specifically? Was there something interesting
939.84s: of the markets? Were you doing work in some capacity around markets or did you just hear of it?
945.36s: And that was the route you took. I started looking at alternative ways to make some more
952.00s: supplemental income because at the time I had a full-time job in film in LA, Brent was expensive
959.92s: and my job and my employment income was not stable. So I think I just kind of started searching
966.32s: up online. I how do you make money online or like site hustle ideas? And trading is the one that
972.00s: kind of appealed more to me because I like the idea that I can sit in front of the computer
980.48s: before I go to work and then try to make some money, maybe like $10, $20, $50 here and there,
986.40s: and then leave and go to work. So I like the fact that I can do the trading in the morning and then go
992.08s: to my job. So that's what really appealed to me. And I think I tried a couple of other things too, but
997.44s: this trading ended up, you know, ended up as the one I focused on. I tried to punch out the things
1002.56s: at the same time too, but ended up picking up focus. Got it. And was the focus on trading because you
1009.52s: were finding success or was it because it was interesting to you or another reason?
1014.48s: No, I definitely wasn't finding success in the beginning. So I'm glad you asked.
1021.76s: But I just really liked it. Like I was really drawn to the idea that also like I was super
1029.12s: young at the time, you know, I was in my early 20s, but I was super drawn to the fact that every
1033.68s: single day is different in trading. I love that this news that happened overnight and change
1040.32s: the older numbers on the screen and the colors, the green and the red, everything can change every
1045.52s: single second. I think I just love the adrenaline and I love that's ever changing and it's not
1052.88s: just like a typical, you know, office job where you do the same task every single day. So I was young,
1060.32s: I was naive and I was stupid and I was hooked. That sounds right. I think that is exactly what goes
1066.16s: for all of us. So I'm right there with you. And so then you started going through this process of
1072.08s: doing your own homework, creating your watch list, waking up earlier so that you could prep for
1076.64s: the market, finding your levels and how long were you doing this for? And is that still kind of what
1085.28s: you're doing today or was there another pivot at some point beyond the pivot from small caps
1090.16s: to mid and large cap stocks? That's a good question because I think my my process of pre-microplanning
1098.96s: of, you know, looking for scanning for stocks to trade, reading the news and then creating my watch
1104.80s: list has been pretty much very, very similar since that beginning stage. I kind of built the
1111.92s: foundation from there and the small things changed here and there like the little details. But for
1117.68s: the most part of my process, the big picture process has been the same for the last, I've been
1123.84s: trading for 10 years, for the last seven years, it's been the same where I'm scanning for stocks
1129.04s: and looking at the charts and looking at news and then I plan the individual plays or the potential
1135.28s: trades that I'm going to trade. So for the most part, it's been the same even like after all these
1142.08s: years. I see. Yeah, that makes a ton of sense. I think I find that too like once you kind of find
1147.52s: your rhythm that it's pretty easy to to sustain it. So that I think that that makes a lot of sense
1153.84s: especially with your approach. What what time frames during the day do you like to trade the most?
1160.56s: Because I know at least from an option trading perspective, which is primarily what I do, there
1164.96s: are different times of days that mean different things to me. And I'm wondering how you view the
1169.76s: trading day. Yeah. So I usually start from looking at the daily charts. The daily is probably the
1177.84s: timeframe in my opinion for my style is the most important. That's where I kind of have a general
1184.64s: at these technical bias along with the news and all that of course. But daily chart is where I
1190.56s: plan out most of my trades using the daily levels. You know, the higher days, the daily resistance,
1198.16s: the 52 week highs, those are probably the most important levels I'll look at. And then once I have
1203.92s: that information, then I'll take a look at the intraday charts. I'm using a lot of the five minute
1210.24s: charts nowadays. So that's one small detail that changed from 10 years ago. I used to use a lot more
1216.96s: one minute charts. Nowadays I use a five minute charts. And the shortest time frame I'll use is two
1223.20s: minute charts. Got it. And do you wait those charts differently for different products or is the
1232.72s: waiting about the same in terms of the time frames? Like if you're trading a mid cap stock versus a
1238.40s: large cap stock, does the way you perceive those time frames carry over or does one get more weight
1244.24s: than the other? Yeah. So we trade a lot of lower float small cap stocks. That's the kind of
1253.20s: small cap stocks I would trade when I do trade them. So the lower the float and the smaller the
1258.88s: market cap, the shorter time frame I go. So for those, usually I'll use a two minute chart.
1265.60s: And then I'll look at five minutes as a reference. So anything under a billion dollars market cap,
1271.44s: I will most likely be using a two minute time frame. And anything over a billion market cap,
1276.40s: I'll be using the five minute or sometimes even the 15 minutes time frame. Got it. Yeah, I'm following
1282.96s: you. Now we, you know we have to talk about this because you already spilled the beans that you tried
1289.92s: trading options. You told me this when we had spoke. And as soon as I heard it, I was like,
1296.16s: damn it. We were so close to converting another one. We were right there. And then it didn't work
1301.92s: probably because of just call yo-lo's, I would guess, but we, yeah, yeah, them damn call yo-lo's.
1310.48s: So we have to talk about the options because I got to tell you one of my long term roadmaps is like
1316.88s: maybe over the next like 30 years. I'm just going to slowly try to move you towards options.
1322.16s: Just a little bit. Maybe so that whenever we catch up once in a while, you're like, well,
1326.24s: I got one trade on that'll, that'll be a big win for us out there. So I'm working on converting
1331.84s: you at least to a degree. But to start the conversion, I need to understand the history with the product.
1338.00s: So when did, when did you first stumble into options and how did it go?
1344.72s: Yeah. So, take a guess. What do you think is the first kind of options trading style or approach I took?
1356.00s: I would have to. I would have to guess out of the money calls. And I would guess shorter term
1364.32s: expiration. I don't know what catalyst you would choose because one of the interesting thing about
1370.40s: options is a lot of the small cap stocks you might have been trading at the time. They might not
1374.24s: even have options. So that part I don't have a good read on. But that would be my my first level
1383.20s: guess is that you're using further out of the money options because they're a cheaper and they can
1386.80s: compound more and not going too far out in time because they're cheaper by not going too far out in
1392.08s: time. That's the guess. Yeah, you're close. I was waiting at zero DTEs. I was trying to scalp those.
1401.68s: So about as short as you can go. Got it. Yeah. Yeah. To shorten my time frame even more.
1406.72s: Oh my god. Yeah. It was so wild. So especially on Fridays, I used to so I at this point, I was still
1414.88s: in a chat room. But the way I used to chat room was very different. I'm just trying to see what other
1419.68s: people's ideas are. And I'll see if there's anything I can trade out of their ideas like my own
1426.24s: strategies. But in the same chat room, there's like an options chat room. So the stuff they're doing
1433.44s: seems extremely intriguing. You take these options, options contracts at only 50 cents. And then
1440.56s: if it hits, it can hit 500% in one day. So that's kind of what attracted me. And at this point,
1447.36s: I was still already finding some success in trading stocks. So I just decided that, you know,
1453.20s: oh, let me try this options thing on the side. Why not? So I kind of just kind of took a course
1460.88s: in options trading. And then I started trading these zero DTEs right away. And then a lot of
1468.08s: the instruments I was trading were just like spy. Especially like you said, the yellow calls,
1474.96s: expiring the same week or sometimes the same day. I remember trading a lot of Tesla when Tesla was
1482.32s: really really hot in 2016, 2017. That was really fun. But I don't think I ever made money from
1491.52s: from zero DTEs. I'll make money here and there. But then when I lose money, I'll lose 100% of it.
1497.84s: Right. So that kind of just cancels out everything. But it was fun. I'll say that. But also one of my
1504.48s: blowups after one of my blowups into my year four was because of options trading because of the
1512.32s: zero DTEs. That's interesting that you blew up that way too, because I assume you were buying
1517.84s: options. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yeah. So to me, I actually find the idea of blowing up your buying
1525.12s: options difficult because your max loss is defined at entry. So were you just sizing things like
1532.24s: a gregiously large or what happened there? No, but it makes it kind of makes sense because when I lose,
1540.08s: I lose 100% of it. And sure, why make money? I'm not I'm not I wasn't that good. So it's not like
1547.84s: I'm making money like a thousand percent, five hundred percent all the time. Well, sometimes when I
1552.16s: make money, it could be 50% 40% less, maybe you have one or two, a couple hundred percent or
1558.56s: a thousand percent. But I think in the long run, my win rate for the zero DTE trade was just so low
1565.44s: that no, the older 100% losses on those trades cancels out everything and more.
1572.40s: I see. Okay. So when you're saying, okay, I took blowup to be more of like a kinetic event like in
1577.92s: a single day, big move, knocked us out, but it sounds more like you like over time. There was
1582.88s: an erosion that essentially zeroed the account out. Yes. Yes. Okay. Got it. Yeah. The breaks my heart
1589.68s: because whatever course you took that sent you into zero DTEs, we need to have a conversation
1597.20s: with that course director, whoever that is and be like, what what are we doing here? But
1603.52s: okay. And then I ran anymore. I think. Yeah, you don't say. Tell me more. I'm blown away that
1610.16s: that could possibly be the case. Well, I think I still think for the way that you trade now,
1618.56s: that options could be really good. But it would, I think you would have to change the way that you
1624.72s: think about them and the way you use them. But we'll see. That'll be that'll be a future project where
1629.44s: maybe I can slowly start subliminally messaging like long calls and short calls and maybe get you
1635.60s: trading some volatility in there. I don't know. We'll see. Just send me those alerts. You know,
1640.72s: that's it. I forgot. I just need to do alerts. How annoying is that? How annoying is that when
1646.32s: people ask about, are you going to do alerts? Does that bother you? Yeah. It does. Like I'm like,
1652.64s: why would you want that upon yourself to have to kind of have to kind of grow a dependency on
1660.80s: someone else holding you what to do? It's your money. Like you need to be able to make the
1665.68s: decisions for yourself. I almost feel offended for them when they ask you those things.
1670.96s: The part that I always find so funny about it is I think a lot of us get into trading for the
1675.68s: idea of making money so that then you achieve financial freedom. And then you, exactly as you say,
1682.16s: you tie it, your financial freedom is now predicated on this other person again. It's essentially just
1688.80s: having a boss again. I find that connection to be pretty funny. But it's still ironic too.
1696.56s: Yeah. It is. Well, the pursuit of easy money is always a learning to everybody. It's why so many people
1702.48s: will go play the lottery, right? Even though from a probability standpoint, it's not necessarily a great
1707.76s: way. People will still do it. So yeah, I can always see there being a group like that. When you look at
1715.36s: your community that you've built, how have they evolved alongside your evolution of trading?
1724.56s: Have they broadly moved with you? Do they do a lot of different things? But there's crossover.
1730.08s: How does that work for your people? Yeah, that's a good question because I will say most people who
1736.00s: join in the first place in that, say that first month and it's understandable. Most of you are
1742.80s: more clueless. They kind of need a guidance. So they are more likely the beginners, the new
1749.28s: new community members. They're more likely to kind of try to do exactly how I teach them the
1756.16s: strategies. Like we have video lessons. They're joining. They'll try to do everything like by the book
1762.00s: and copy exactly what I'm looking for, which is great. I rather them do that than to try to like
1768.24s: figure out zero DTEs or try to trace stocks. But I think in the beginning, most people are going
1775.12s: to be very by the book. Oh, that's say I'm looking for, I'm saying, oh, in the strategy, look for 20%
1780.96s: gap, they'll do exactly that. And I think that's fine. But I think gradually, you know, most traders
1787.28s: and most members, after at least three or six months of very intensive learning and trading,
1792.96s: they start to develop their own way of thinking. They start to change the strategy. I teach them
1798.56s: to kind of modify to change and then to fit their own style. So maybe make strategy. The first one
1804.88s: I taught them was, you know, a little bit too conservative. Maybe they decide that, hey, like,
1809.60s: instead of risking 2%, I want to risk 5%. So but then by that time, it's up to them. They have the
1816.32s: proper foundation. They know the tools and they have the knowledge. You kind of tweak the strategies,
1821.68s: tweak the criteria, tweak the scanners to fit what works the best for them according to their
1828.16s: risk tolerance. So in the beginning, everyone's not going to be by the book trying to copy exactly
1835.12s: what you say in the video lessons. But at the end, you know, after a year, after two years,
1840.40s: they usually develop their own style and they know exactly what they're looking for. And now a lot
1846.24s: of the people who's been here for a while, I'm asking for their ideas. I'm asking to see what they're
1852.16s: looking at because I know by now how they trade, they have almost like a different strategy after
1858.08s: old, old as time. So it's kind of the reverse now. I would try to like pick the brain and try to see
1864.64s: what they're looking at and see if there's anything I can use in my own strategies and try to
1870.24s: apply my own thing to make money. So that's the thing I love about trading. You can be very flexible,
1876.88s: and you can make things your own. Yeah. Well, it's also cool that you guys create an environment for
1883.04s: that because like we were talking about in the beginning, I actually think that's probably one of
1886.08s: the most defining features of somebody that can be successful at this long term is doing exactly
1892.80s: that. It's taking the time to like build something that makes sense for them. When you look over your
1899.36s: trading career, what are some of the things that you used to do that as you think about it? You're like,
1905.28s: why would I ever do that? But you did. What kind of things like that exists for you?
1912.00s: Yeah. I think in the very beginning, I was very opposed to trading the mega caps,
1918.80s: like the apples, the Amazon, the Google, the Nvidia. At the time, it didn't make sense because
1926.16s: it felt like a very well, you trade options. I feel like you might agree with this. It felt like
1931.76s: a very inefficient way of using your capital, right? That's Nvidia's now like what, what was it?
1939.68s: $140 or something like that? If I traded, I'll probably have to, like $140, at the time,
1948.88s: I was trading a small account. I couldn't afford that many shares to make money. So I can probably
1954.00s: take what 50 shares and then try to try to make a dollar to dollars from that. This is day trading.
1960.32s: So at the time, it doesn't make sense that why would anyone want to trade that? But I think now,
1966.00s: I'm more open to the idea and actually prefer trading the big caps over the small caps because they
1972.72s: are a lot more, in my opinion, at least in today, they're a lot more predictable. They kind of
1978.00s: follow trends a certain way. And there are certain chart patterns and price action that you just
1984.72s: see repeatedly again, again, in all these mega cap stocks. So now I'm more, a lot more open to the
1993.04s: idea of let's just say trading and video, the actual stock and something like Apple, Amazon,
1999.04s: where you then Tesla, like I'll trade them. I'll take the extra shares.
2003.20s: Got it. That's really interesting. When you're deciphering the predictability of something
2010.32s: like mega cap versus another size company, are you running like a broad style analysis or is it
2018.00s: kind of pattern built in by seeing and you're just looking at it every day? And that's how you're
2023.28s: building your understanding of the relationship with some of these patterns.
2027.28s: Yeah. So I used to study a lot of charts. I still do, but obviously not as intensive as I
2034.24s: did the first four years. So I used to save charts and now I'll analyze, I'll save a different
2040.08s: timeframes. We talked about like one minute, one minute chart, daily chart, five minute charts.
2045.68s: So I used to save those charts, but all the stocks I've traded. And it's not like I memorized
2053.44s: a pattern, but over time, you kind of start seeing some similar trend and some similar patterns.
2058.56s: That's a, the morning setup looks a certain way on the five minute charts and there's negative
2063.20s: news in the market. You know, there's certain things that you can't predict them or guarantee it
2069.44s: 100% all the time, but there's certain things that you start to see that, hey, like maybe I can,
2074.80s: I can, you know, you just educate a guest and then try to build a strategy around, you know,
2080.32s: when the chart sets up this way, when it gaps up and sells off to the middle of the day,
2085.52s: what's likely going to happen. So a lot to answer your questions, a lot of that is just based on
2091.44s: past experience and seeing the same charts and the same price action over and over again.
2098.00s: So a lot of observation time. Yeah. It's, yeah. That's one of the things that always fascinated me
2103.20s: with like pattern style trading because I, I tend to apply a bit of a quantitative approach
2110.00s: with a practical approach. I'm like a middle ground between something like what you would do versus
2115.44s: what like a quant would do. I'm like the, the, I don't know, I'm kind of like the idiot that does
2120.40s: both and not that great. That's really what it was down to. So it's kind of cool that you've picked
2125.44s: a specific learning modality that is really connected for you when you're looking at these different
2131.36s: patterns and stuff, especially when it comes to short term trading time frames. There's,
2136.16s: there's a million of them. You see so many people talk about all of these different kinds of
2140.16s: candlestick pattern setups, price levels, stuff like that. How did you start to navigate to like
2145.12s: what worked for you? How did you find that? Because one of the things I'm trying to strike at here is
2151.68s: when you're first starting, if you're trying to find something that works, you try it for two weeks,
2157.28s: it doesn't work, and then you dump it. That might have been the right thing, but you just might not
2163.28s: have tried it for long enough. So I feel like that's a really difficult balance to strike, and obviously
2168.24s: you found a way to navigate that. So can you talk us through it? Yeah, I think that's a, that's a,
2174.72s: that's a common question. I see a lot as well, but I think usually when people ask me that,
2181.04s: well, like a lot of those are actually my members in my community. When they say that to me, I'm like,
2186.24s: okay, show me your journal. Show me the charts. Show me the charts to save. That's the end. And
2190.48s: then they usually say, oh, I don't have it. So, so a lot of times you might be trying, they might be
2196.88s: trying that that said strategy or that said chart pattern or that said set up for two weeks, but when
2203.76s: they don't actually journal it down and save the charts, then I don't think that's, I don't think
2210.32s: you are actually testing and testing the strategy the right way when you are not recording actual data.
2216.88s: So, so the way I look at it is, at this you need at these, you know, 50 sample size of those
2223.12s: trades and everything needs to be journaled and then the charts need to be saved. And then for you
2227.92s: to go back and actually look at, okay, like, is it me or is it a strategy? You know, I think,
2234.64s: I think people have to kind of answer that question themselves, honestly. So that's how I kind of
2240.40s: start to navigate building setup is from saving tons of charts, whether it's the actual strategies
2247.12s: that traded or the ones I missed by didn't trade, I still see a similar setup. I'll save it. I'll
2252.56s: collect a bunch of sample sizes of a particular strategy that I think, hey, there might be a
2258.40s: pattern there or there might be a strategy here that that's repeatable. Start with collecting charts.
2264.88s: And then I used to be very, very big into spreadsheets. So I'll spreadsheet everything. That's a,
2270.00s: you know, the smoke cap stock when it gaps up over 50%. You know, it's likely to have like an
2275.52s: old day fade and I'll track the success of that and how, what's a percentage of the fade can be?
2282.00s: You know, I'm saying like, when a stock gaps up, we're talking about just smoke cap stocks. What's
2286.88s: the probability of this happening? And I'll even track it by months. So, you know, during some of
2292.16s: months, the probabilities like 30% was lower during the winter and the fall and the spring,
2298.40s: the probabilities a lot higher. So I use to track everything. So that's how I start to build at
2304.56s: these some sense of, okay, pattern recognition in which I call this actual valuable data collection,
2312.56s: actual valuable information as opposed to just trying to set up for two weeks, thinking you
2318.72s: actually tried the strategy, but in fact, you didn't record any of it. I hope this makes sense.
2325.52s: It makes it, it makes a ton of sense. It makes a ton of sense because I find people do that with
2330.72s: a ton of things across trading where they have hazardly tried something. There's no record to
2336.48s: actually refer what the outcomes were. And there, there, those kinds of things are so prone to path.
2342.48s: And that's kind of what I was highlighting by talking that through with you because if you try
2346.56s: something for two weeks and then you just bail on it, that thing might have worked, but you don't
2352.08s: have a good record to be able to say objectively, yes or no, and you might not have let it try long
2357.52s: enough. Now, going back to the broader question though, when you first started trading like these
2364.56s: different setups and patterns, how did you call through the thousands that are there and say,
2371.84s: I'm going to try these 15, these 10, these five, whatever and see how these work. And then how
2378.08s: did you narrow that down? Because when I think about the prospects of day trading via some sort of
2382.72s: like candlestick patterns or just price behavior on an intraday time frame, I think that's probably one
2387.84s: of the most common things I see people talk about is like, how do you pick? Are you going to use a
2392.56s: doji or you're going to use the hammers? Like they use all the individual candles then setups of
2397.76s: candles like the three of three down like all those kinds of things. How did you sift through the
2402.72s: broad universe of intraday patterns into the things you thought were worth testing and then from
2408.48s: there, how did you narrow that down further? So I think there's two aspects to this question.
2414.88s: The first one is I don't actually, I know Kenno State patterns and chart patterns are, I don't
2422.32s: people use that interchangeably, but I don't actually use the candlestick patterns like oh,
2428.48s: shooting star, like I don't actually use that, but I look at the bigger picture like what the
2434.96s: entire day chart look like where they has higher lows. I look at that and what the trend looks like.
2440.72s: So I'm more, I'm also looking at candlestick trends than the individual candlestick patterns.
2447.68s: But when that's my style of looking at charts, but when I look at the entire chart, I feel like I can
2453.76s: see a bigger picture. Now where does that initial inspiration come from? Well, it comes from like the
2459.84s: initial when I was in the chat rooms and I took a lot of courses. While the chat room alerts don't work,
2468.16s: I do believe in like some of the educations that taught you, even though you cannot just like I
2473.92s: say, you cannot take someone's strategy and kind of completely copy and make it, make it work for
2479.44s: you. A lot of times you can be inspired by it. And even if it doesn't work for you at the end,
2486.48s: you can be inspired by it and look at the chart that maybe perhaps somebody is doing a
2493.20s: did by strategy. Even if that actual execution, execution or strategy doesn't work for me,
2499.68s: I look at it charts. I look at the chart patterns that talking about what the daily chart looks like,
2505.12s: what the intraday looks like. And then I'll start seeing that, okay, like, you know, even though I
2509.44s: cannot execute the trades, like he was she taught me to, I can still trade the same chart in my own
2515.36s: way. So that's what I mean by I was really inspired by a lot of the common chart patterns the
2520.48s: small cap traders use. Some common ones are like the first green day, the first red day, or like
2527.20s: the parabolic charts. Those are really, really common chart patterns with very similar appearances
2533.60s: in the daily charts all the time for small cap stocks. And then from there, I kind of just kind of
2539.12s: start building my own kind of executions. And then talk me through how those executions translated
2546.80s: into what you trade now. So before you're looking at first green day, first red day, parabolic moves,
2553.44s: what has that turned into and what have you noticed about what applies to small caps and may or may
2560.40s: not apply to larger mega caps? Yeah. So I mean, I think I it's better if I pick like a like a specific
2570.32s: kind of chart, like a specific strategy. So there's a I can pull a chart up if you want. Sure. Let me
2577.60s: think what's a good one. We can look at here go. Okay, we can look at let's say
2592.16s: and video. This is not a really good example. We can look at SMCI.
2598.40s: And then what time frame do you like? Uh, deity. And then what do you call back to um, mid February
2611.12s: until February 16. So from early February to February 16, 2024 on the deity. Oh, daily candles got
2620.88s: that deity candles. Yeah. Got it. Oh, that's actually really cool that you do that. And then you said
2627.92s: February. Mm hmm. Oh, one. I bet.
2634.80s: You can do February first. I think February first till just you can or you can just do the entire
2641.36s: February if it's easier. Got it. Yes. So I have February first until today. Okay. Sweet.
2650.16s: And then I have us on a daily and then I can get rid of this this crap. These are just moving
2654.80s: averages. If it's too noisy, I can dump them. But okay. So the the chart I want to focus on is
2661.52s: the early February where you can see like this consecutive green candles when the stock went
2667.84s: from 400 to a thousand dollars in like what two weeks or so. So you see all those straight up green
2674.48s: candles. So when I see that on the daily chart, whether it's a small cap or a large cap, like we
2680.00s: call this like a parabolic deity chart when the stock just goes up and up and up with very little
2686.40s: pullback every single day. And so number one, why I see that I know that okay, like short sellers
2692.88s: are getting squeezed. You know, we saw some similar patterns for GameStop, for the Tesla years ago,
2700.72s: short sellers are getting squeezed. And every single day the dips are getting bought back up.
2705.44s: So I know that the shorts are in pain. But at the same time, you know, we also know that eventually,
2710.96s: you know, I say eventually, there will be a huge red day to pullback because in terms of price
2716.88s: action, this is like, you know, a lot of irrational buying and also a lot of the a lot of the buying
2723.60s: is from short sellers covering on the way up. We're talking about all the parabolic green candles.
2729.12s: So there's a couple ways to play this when, you know, as crazy and as dangerous as the sounds,
2735.36s: a lot of times with these kind of parabolic deity charts, we do what I do, I say the trend
2740.96s: join long. I'll try to join a trend and intraday out, I'll keep buying on the way up because I
2745.84s: know shorts are getting squeezed. I'll try to do that on like the third or the fourth day,
2751.12s: green candle. And a lot of times I'll swing them even like after a day, try to swing them into those
2756.80s: huge, you can see like, you know, nearly and the candles stay between in between the
2763.92s: the last three green candles before the huge red candle. There's a huge gap in between.
2770.16s: So this is how you know, like a stock is like taking off. Like it's already going parabolic when
2775.84s: there's a huge gap in between the candles. And there's going to be a huge red day coming soon.
2780.72s: It could be the next three days, four days, five days. But then if, you know, I will take the longs
2786.96s: during those intraday and try to like take advantage of those huge moves. That's when, you know,
2792.32s: the the the the the ATR, the sorry, the average to range of a stock can increases a lot intraday,
2800.08s: the range of the stock. So I'll go long during those. I call the trend join long when I see this kind
2806.00s: of daily candles. And then a lot of traders, small caps or large caps, they'll time that huge red
2812.16s: candle. So the first red day, the reason is called the first red days because you have multiple days
2818.72s: of green candle going into it. So there hasn't been a huge pullback at all since, you know, this is
2824.00s: what February first was February second. So the stock has been green for the last two weeks straight.
2829.68s: So when there's a red candle, that candle is going to be huge. So usually when we try to short those
2836.96s: when once the stock is actually red on the day, then I'll short those knowing that the downside
2843.12s: is a lot greater because the stock has been so extended, right? It's like polling a rubber band
2849.04s: when you stretch it so far for so many days and you just so intense and there's just so much buying
2856.16s: tight in the stock. When you finally you release the rubber band finally, it's going to snap all
2861.68s: the way over and I get overextended to a downside. So then what time and try to trade a short day when
2869.44s: there is a short day confirmed, then you just join it to the downside this time. You just short it
2874.48s: all the way down a lot of times you get like a pullback for two or three days. So then now be the
2880.08s: other side of the trade once the the parabolic breakout move is done, then you try to I try to trade
2886.56s: the first red day. But you know, the patterns that we look at we start from a date and they I'll trade
2892.96s: it today. What's really funny is I have to be honest with you, I didn't expect this, but you and I
2899.36s: look at some of the same things and we do, but we trade them slightly differently. So for stuff like
2907.28s: this, I have kind of different scans that count consecutive updates. Essentially soon as there's
2913.60s: three or above, it adds it to a list and then I rank it by gaps between them. Okay. And I look for
2920.64s: a very similar and it's funny. I call it the same thing a parabolic up move. And I'll trade those
2926.32s: with options though, but I typically don't try to do it in today, but I normally will try to run it
2932.48s: over a timeframe for your perspective. It looks like some of these intraday periods would be much
2938.88s: more lucrative than others. Is there a way that you kind of screen how strong you think the day might
2945.60s: be for a move as compared to something else? Because I look at these and these are kind of like
2949.52s: little boring days, probably not well, I guess that is a big candle. Maybe this one's a better example.
2953.60s: And you know, it's a smaller overall day as compared to stuff like this that have just much bigger moves.
2961.52s: Do you wait them in some way? Do you have some sort of predictive tool that you try to analyze what
2966.40s: you think that up move might look like for the day? Yeah, I keep it extremely simple. The day I'm
2973.68s: trading it as a today's Friday, then today's open and today's lower day needs to be higher than
2981.04s: yesterday's higher day. So the stock needs to have already opened and traded above the higher day
2987.76s: from the day before. So the candles you're pointing at those tiny ones, I wouldn't be trading those
2993.28s: because they're under yesterday's highs. Got it. Yep. So the high was here. This one opened it
2998.32s: look like super close to it. This one you definitely wouldn't have touched. This one you wouldn't
3002.64s: have touched. And then this is this typically then what do you think you'd be entering in like
3007.92s: something like in here? Yes. Yeah. Once the one's a stock breaks above yesterday's right? Yeah. Got
3015.20s: it. And then when you're looking for the short, it sounds like this one is a little bit more of a
3021.04s: carry trade for you. Less of an intraday thinks you said typically there's successive days that follow
3027.52s: that is there a reason why you trade this over a couple days and not to try to hold this for a
3034.16s: couple day move? Or is it this one you're just expecting to trade it intraday? Anyways, capture most
3039.20s: of the move. And then this one you have some sort of data that infers once this happens, it's
3046.24s: overwhelmingly probabilistic going to be a continuation move of some sort. Yeah. So I'm trying to
3054.24s: kind of adapt a little bit more now. Before the long side and short side for both of those,
3059.52s: I will only swing it and keep it for a couple of days. If I like I would open a start or trade
3066.48s: as a day trade. And then I'll close it and look at the chart and see whether there might be more
3071.84s: the next day. And now it may be like save like a quarter of my day trade into the next couple of days.
3077.76s: I see. So that's how I usually do things, but I'm trying to kind of try to maximize the trade with
3085.28s: a separate swing trading account. Now I kind of open a new account in the middle of the year.
3090.48s: So that one I want to start to maximize it and just strictly do day trade. So swing trades in
3095.84s: that account. Yeah. I love that because one of the things I think about especially is your
3100.96s: highlighting, which makes a lot of sense to me with the way that you're playing the parabolic move,
3104.88s: but the point that I would be curious about is the gaps that you would miss. Because a lot of
3110.56s: these moves and it's from I run it through Python. So I have like a really large data set,
3115.76s: depending on the kind of product and the behavior when it starts moving into these parabolic
3122.08s: up moves. And to me, that seems like a really strong return source for you potentially. So that's
3128.00s: cool that you're kind of tinkering with that. I love that. You think of it that way. That's super
3132.64s: cool. Thank you so much for walking through some of this stuff. I love learning and sharing
3137.52s: different approaches to markets. That's kind of some of the coolest parts about this.
3141.52s: Yeah. And like it's really cool that we both see the same chart. We just describe it. And maybe
3148.48s: we use both say parabolic, but maybe in the beginning, you didn't really understand what I was
3153.04s: talking about until we see the same chart that we know all what's talking about the exact same chart.
3158.40s: I have to like I did not expect that. I really didn't. I thought that you would be looking for
3162.72s: completely different things than I typically do. And then as soon as you pointed that out, I was like
3166.80s: that this is actually kind of nuts because there's like heavy crossover there. Even the way that you
3172.32s: play the down move is fascinating to me. I play that a little differently. Not in terms of
3177.92s: following the trend down. I'll do that. But I don't use strategies that capitalize on the down moves
3183.76s: as much. So you've actually given me some homework. Believe it or not, to take a look at the
3188.72s: probability of the big red day and the size of the move on those. So thank you for thank you for
3193.20s: the homework. Oh, worries. A couple of last questions for you. So I think one of the coolest things
3200.72s: that traders that have been in the game for a while can do is to just share not necessarily some of
3207.28s: their biggest mistakes. There's a million of those all over the place. But the thing I like to try
3212.80s: to explore with people are some of the things that you learned and think other people should know
3218.16s: that are not talked about that much. Do you have anything like that that comes to mind for you in
3223.12s: your path? Yeah. So that's also another reason I'm trying to swing trade more this year and even
3231.04s: open the new account because I do feel like day traders for the most part would leave a lot of
3237.68s: money on the table. So I agree with what you said before. You can maximize it more. So that's
3244.48s: the one part I'm really trying to work on this year and next year. I do think that there are a lot
3251.36s: of times where you know, yeah, day trading, you can make a lot of money, but for certain chart
3256.72s: patterns like the one we just talked about, you know, you can make even more with swing trading.
3263.12s: We just obviously with swing trading, I would be more selective and only swing trade when I see
3268.48s: you know, certain very, very good setups. I think just day trading wouldn't do it justice.
3274.56s: So I think that's a part that I'm trying to learn more and improve on this year. And I don't think
3280.80s: I mean, I don't think I am allowed to say that, oh, I have it figured out, I'll have it figured out
3288.16s: in terms of maximizing my swing trading. But I think just the fact that this year, I'm really trying
3293.60s: to work on turning some really good day trades into swing trades. I think that's a good start.
3299.12s: But I know I'm not by no means am I an expert in swing trading. I think that's awesome. And I
3305.12s: think more than anything, you're sharing such an important mindset, which is evolution, right?
3311.20s: Like you've been trading for over a decade now and you were talking about that and the way you do
3315.28s: things. And I have to say that's just another pure commonality I find between those of us that
3322.40s: tend to trade for a long time is we constantly are looking for other ways we can do things.
3328.96s: Like you gave me an idea in this one, right? Like that's the whole point is that we're always
3332.64s: looking for different things. So I'm actually really stoked about the swing training component. And
3337.68s: I am eager to hear your results because I have some ideas on what we'll see and I think it'll be
3344.48s: good to be honest. So I'm excited for that. The last question I have for you is I know that the
3350.96s: the Lamborghini is a big part of your brand, right? Like we have the Lamborghini microphone.
3356.80s: I don't even know what those things are called. The little microphone cover thing.
3360.08s: You know how much like the thing is. Yeah, the song thing. Yeah, I guess maybe so people
3366.40s: hit themselves on the face or something crazy. But anyways, I love the joke around the Lamborghini,
3373.84s: but I am a car guy and I love McLaren's. So I'm wondering if I can find a way to send you
3381.52s: a McLaren thing and maybe once in a while I could get a guest appearance on the mic thing.
3387.52s: We can try. I mean, I don't know. I have McLaren's like supposedly better than Lamborghini. I don't
3394.08s: know cars. So it's one of those things that like better is such a strange thing. It's like,
3400.16s: they're all so over that I have them. I have them. I love them. But like it's all just so over
3405.60s: the top. It's all bullshit. So I wouldn't call one inherently better than the other. It's kind of like
3410.56s: none of us that are buying them. I run a car club. So like I love driving and stuff like that. But
3416.16s: not a professional driver. So you could have somebody that's probably a professional driver beat
3420.32s: me in a Honda Civic. So you know, it's I think it's more about what style you like. But anyways,
3426.32s: I am curious. I have to see if I can find one of those little microphone cover things and see if
3430.72s: I can get just just a one guest stand in would be great. That would be pretty cool. Yeah, if you can
3435.68s: find that I would love to feature a McLaren. Perfect. Well, I love that. I'll keep that door open.
3441.52s: This is good. I mean, this is a great win for my side of the deal because I'm going to slowly
3447.92s: pressure you. Hopefully more and more to looking at options. And then maybe we get them
3452.72s: clearing out there. So I call it a great victory across the board. But it's time for you to run.
3458.88s: And I am just so appreciative for you to come hang out for a while, especially because you really
3465.52s: do bring such a different perspective. And my hands down favorite thing about you. It's what
3470.96s: drew me to you in the first place is that I find that there are so few genuine voices in this space.
3477.84s: And it's very cool to find one that I would consider to be very genuine. So thanks for doing
3483.76s: everything that you do. And thanks for coming to hang out for a while. Thanks Eric. Yeah, that was
3488.16s: fun conversation. I promise at some point I will promise to properly look at options and give
3496.00s: those shots. I can promise you that. That's the only issue. Let me know whenever you do, I'll
3501.36s: literally jump on a call with you. And I will hold your hand all the way through it to make sure
3505.68s: that it's not a bad experience because I think especially for your style of trading, they really
3510.88s: could be very cool. But yeah, we'll have to tinker with them. Thank you so much for your time.
3515.12s: And then for people that want to find you, like I said, I'll throw your website and all of your other
3521.28s: social media handles in the description. Is there anywhere else that you want to direct people
3525.36s: to or anything like that? I think just my YouTube, Instagram, my website, socials, all that good
3531.92s: stuff is good. Perfect. So you guys can check all of that out in the description below. Thanks
3537.20s: everybody for hanging out, being outlier. And we'll see you guys later.
