0.00s: What's up, outliers?
2.88s: Welcome back to that LAR podcast.
4.44s: I have a gust in here to tell us how trading is super easy.
8.92s: It's a way to fast, easy riches with minimal effort, stable, monthly income, and I'm really
15.28s: excited to learn the secret.
16.64s: So, up, gusts.
18.64s: Thanks for having me on.
20.44s: It's good.
21.44s: So, being is that I nailed that intro.
24.80s: The funny part is for those that obviously wouldn't know, but when we originally started
29.96s: talking, I had mentioned doing a podcast and you were like, that sounds kind of interesting,
35.08s: but I'm not sure would be exactly the right fit because my primary piece of advice is
40.04s: don't trade.
42.08s: And I actually thought it was funny because even though I do what I do, that's typically
47.00s: my advice.
48.00s: So, once we realized that we had that actually drastically uncommon, I'd love to unpack
53.40s: that because here we are two dudes on a podcast talking about trading where the basic
58.04s: advice is, don't trade, why do you think people are best off avoiding that?
62.28s: Yeah, look, I mean, I think a lot of people get into it for pretty, pretty believable reasons.
70.24s: Like, oh, they think that maybe this is a way to make money, maybe it's an easier way
74.36s: to make money than slogging away at some 95 job.
77.76s: I get to be my own boss.
79.12s: I get to do what I want.
81.08s: I've always had a passion for this, et cetera.
82.96s: So, I can get the idea in the interest.
86.96s: But I think I'm a person of analogies and this is probably the first of many that I'm going
92.44s: to give you over the course of an hour, but I think you really have to understand that
97.04s: trading and financial markets is like playing in the NBA or playing in the NFL, except
102.96s: that there's no teams, there's no draft, there's no salary, it's just, there you go.
110.84s: There's JJ Watts trying to get through it, right?
113.08s: Like, that's it, that's the game, right?
115.92s: And so your prior should be before you even think about it or start that, like, okay,
122.00s: this is not going to be especially easy, especially because the JJ Watts of the world
127.24s: have resources that you can't even imagine up going up against you.
131.44s: So that's maybe my headline analogy about it.
134.16s: Well, and I think it's perfect.
136.48s: Could you double click a little more into the resource section?
140.00s: Because there's kind of a couple different ways to go about trading.
146.00s: I'm coming up on two decades and one of the things that I've obviously come to appreciate
151.80s: pretty quickly is that if you're like, get in real fit in, you have to figure out where
156.40s: you can play.
157.40s: So can you talk a little bit about the the resource and side of it, that's actually a huge
161.20s: piece of the equation?
162.20s: Yeah, I mean, the thing you're saying, like, you hear it in poker, hopefully you hear
166.20s: it in poker where if you're at a table with nine other players and they're the best
172.96s: players in the world, it kind of doesn't matter how good you are, like, that's just not
176.76s: a game that you should be playing in.
178.68s: And so like you said, like table selection is everything in trading in poker in life,
185.24s: maybe.
187.12s: And so I want to say at the outset, like, I can, I know that there are profitable retail
193.52s: traders out there.
194.52s: I, you know, a couple of my friends do this for a living and they're on their own and
197.68s: they don't have any big infrastructure or resources or anything like that.
201.60s: But the reason they can do it is because they know what they're good at and they stick
204.84s: to that.
205.84s: And in particular, it's something that they figured out for themselves that works for them.
210.56s: It's not a system.
211.56s: It's not a, it's just they figured out through a trial and error years of, like, trying
216.76s: to figure out out for themselves.
219.84s: The thing that kind of pains me when I see it online on Twitter or elsewhere is when
224.72s: you see somebody who is interested in this and then they drop some money for a course or
229.56s: something.
230.56s: And that course is teaching them how to, like, click, trade the S&P 500 futures and
235.92s: somehow they're going to make money there.
237.60s: Like you have to understand that the people you're trading against, they're incredibly
242.40s: profitable businesses for a reason, right?
244.36s: They bring in the smartest people they can, the payment bunch of money, they have access
247.92s: to computational resources, they have access to prime brokers, they have access to cost
251.72s: basis, they have access to capital, they have all this access that a retail trader can't
257.00s: possibly compete with the machines that they're, they're deploying, make decisions on
261.68s: more information than a retail trader can make in under a microsecond.
265.20s: Like you're just not going to win in that game.
267.76s: It's not to say there's no games you can't win at, but the set of games you can win at
273.12s: is pretty small.
275.76s: And you spent time at Jane Street is what, like, six years is that right?
280.12s: Yeah, that's right.
281.88s: So what were some of the conversations and problems that you guys are solving there to
287.28s: give people a sense of the other side and what you guys, you sneaky little, I'm just kidding,
294.12s: what you guys are up to?
295.92s: Yeah, look, I think when we do, I used to do a lot of recruiting and so people would
301.32s: ask us, like, so what is it that you do?
303.44s: And one of the best analogies that I heard, it wasn't mine, but I'm going to steal it shamelessly,
308.44s: it's the belonging sandwich business, right?
311.00s: Like if I can buy baloney, bread and cheese for like $3 a sandwich, make the sandwich and sell
317.96s: that sandwich for $4, that's a business, right?
321.68s: And that is what ETF market making is, that's what ADR market making is.
325.76s: It's a little bit what options, maybe ETF options market making is, it's a, right?
330.76s: It's understanding mechanical relationships between securities and then providing a service
336.76s: to the world.
337.92s: Market making is definitely providing a service to the world by always being willing to buy
342.16s: and sell.
343.16s: That service has value, has value proportional to how volatile, roughly speaking to how
347.60s: volatile the security is.
350.00s: And so it makes sense that that can be a business, right?
352.60s: But the thing is, there's no real barrier to entry for this business.
356.20s: And so because of that, it's incredibly incredibly competitive.
360.00s: You have to be very, very sharp and you have to have extremely low cost and extremely
365.16s: good technology and really sharp people.
368.44s: Now in the game of market making specifically across different asset classes, it's also
376.80s: a completely different game than what a retail trader might be attempting to accomplish.
382.16s: Could you talk a little bit about the goal there versus retail trading?
386.12s: And the reason why I'm asking to explore this point is because a lot of times retail traders
389.80s: say to themselves, like, oh, I have to emulate the big guys.
393.52s: That's how I'm going to make money.
395.08s: I got a, you know, pretend and try to be like them.
397.32s: Right.
398.32s: No, I mean, that's obviously maybe a full game is what I would say.
401.52s: Right.
402.52s: Like the idea of a market maker is you don't really have an opinion about which way the
406.12s: security will go.
407.48s: You just want to in principle collect the spread.
410.40s: Now that sounds really easy the way I said it, right?
412.88s: Like I just put some bids out here, puts a mask out here, see who shows up, blah, blah,
416.40s: wonderful.
417.72s: Except the big challenge with any kind of liquidity provision is the adverse selection,
423.00s: right?
423.36s: Like people are going to be really, really smart.
425.56s: And if you post a bad market, you're going to do all the bad trades you want.
429.20s: And if you post a good market, then like, yeah, you might get like a trade here
432.76s: there.
433.56s: And so the systematic adverse selection of market making is part of what makes it such
437.48s: a hard, interesting problem.
439.96s: Whereas retail trading, I would imagine not being a retail trader myself.
444.28s: I'm pretty uninformed.
445.52s: The honest is more about like can you identify some effects of misprice?
452.48s: Something that the world doesn't understand as well as you do.
456.16s: And then can you put a trade on that expresses that belief in a way that it's like
462.76s: cost effective and risk effective enough for it to actually make money for you?
466.24s: It's like a two stages to the problem, right?
468.76s: Like you can identify all the inefficiency you want.
471.28s: But if you can't put the trade on it like efficiently, then it doesn't help you very much.
475.92s: The other thing you've talked about before is especially from like a self-directed lens
481.88s: is doing less.
483.72s: Why is that something you hard-bomb?
487.20s: But because every time you trade, you're paying somebody money, right?
490.72s: You're paying the broker money, you're paying like your counterparty money.
494.32s: Huh?
495.32s: I said, but there's no commission.
497.32s: I imagine that the no commission thing has been touched on in your podcast before.
503.80s: But yeah, like you're obviously always like every action you do has a cost to it, right?
508.88s: Even if it is your commission, let's just say it's your commission, right?
511.68s: It has a cost in terms of your attention, in terms of what you're paying attention to,
514.96s: in terms of what you have to manage from a risk perspective.
518.08s: So yeah, like putting a trade on in the simplest possible way is probably the thing you should do
523.44s: most more often than not, right?
526.20s: The interesting part about that with respect to trading specifically is this idea of sample size.
532.84s: And if you want to set something up so that you touch it as little as possible,
538.52s: but you also have to do enough to get a healthy sample size, how would you kind of balance
543.64s: that juxtaposition?
545.40s: Yeah, so I think that's where understanding some math comes in, honestly.
549.72s: And I'm not saying it's the only way to do trading.
552.44s: I'm not going to say here to say that, but I don't know of a way to do this without
555.88s: understanding a little bit about the math.
558.68s: I think it's pretty clear that if you're doing something where it's a lot of trades every day,
563.96s: then you're going to get to a high sample size pretty quickly,
567.80s: but probably just by the nature of competitive markets, the edges that you're exploiting
571.48s: are probably pretty small.
572.68s: And so it's going to take you some amount of time to figure out like,
575.64s: does this actually make money or not?
577.64s: Or you could go the other direction, right?
579.32s: Or you do some infrequent trades, once a day or once a week or whatever, right?
584.68s: You need probably fewer samples if that's a profitable trade for that strategy,
589.00s: because hopefully the edges on those kinds of trades are much larger.
592.68s: So they're all kind of even doubted some sets.
595.48s: Which, or raise beautifully into the next general point on that,
599.32s: which is this idea of like even being able to like quantify your edge,
603.24s: because one of the fun things in retail trading, at least from my own experiences,
608.76s: there's some things I can look at, I can measure, and I can see robustness over duration.
614.12s: And other things, I'm the fucking clue why it's working, but I could see it,
618.60s: and it's kind of there.
619.72s: So could you talk about that seemingly thing that's you know,
623.72s: a granted, but it's actually a little more complex?
627.08s: Yeah, so it's funny.
629.08s: I talked to a friend of mine, former James,
630.92s: friend of mine earlier today, and I told him I was coming on this podcast,
634.52s: and he said, oh yeah, so he actually, he left a big trading company recently,
640.04s: and he's going to start out doing stuff that stuff on his own.
642.52s: Just great, I'm sure he's going to do great.
643.96s: And so he's been trying to understand more about sort of the retail side of things,
648.76s: and that's sort of thing.
650.28s: And what he said to me is, I think pretty interesting,
653.48s: he said, look, I think a lot of these people who are retail traders have been successful
658.68s: for years and years, I believe that they are.
661.48s: Like, I don't doubt that a retail trader can make money,
664.60s: but just the way they talk about their trading,
667.48s: there's probably a bit of what you just said, right, where it's clear they have some
672.36s: edge, but they might not be thinking about it quite the right way, or maybe as optimally as they could.
678.92s: I think that gets back to something, I think you might have said earlier, which is
681.80s: it's an iterative process.
683.24s: Like, if you're doing the same thing today that you did last year,
687.00s: that you did the year before, etc., you're probably not going to do well.
690.44s: It's just such an iterative game of just trying to get just that tiny, tiny bit better every single day.
697.80s: There's also this really interesting thing early on where you don't know what you don't know,
706.04s: and then it's difficult to tell if what you're doing is actually value-add, or if it's path,
714.52s: what are some of the ways that you can think of to explore that, to be able to stress test
720.20s: is this path, or is this some sort of value-add?
725.08s: Right, yeah, so I think a lot of that has to do with,
730.36s: I read a lot when people talk about retail trading about emotional control and staying with
735.88s: this thing. It's important to know that stuff.
739.56s: I'm sure that's important, but it's not nearly as important as having edge.
743.48s: There's no amount of emotional control that will turn a losing strategy into a profitable strategy.
749.64s: I think maybe my best answer that, again, talking to friends who do this is you need to have
757.48s: a small group of people that you can talk to, where you trust their judgment, they trust your
764.12s: judgment, and I'm not talking about a large, discord group, or anything like that. I'm talking
771.80s: about three, four, or five people, where you're talking most days, and you're saying, hey,
777.08s: this is a thing I'm seeing, like this is a sound reasonable to you, et cetera,
780.60s: getting that feedback from another set of eyes. I think is probably the thing that accelerates
786.44s: you the most, at least at the beginning. Maybe they're a little bit further ahead in their journey
793.00s: than you are, and that helps you. It helps them too, right? I'm at this point pretty old,
799.16s: and yet I still get a ton out of talking to more junior people because it forces me to go back and
805.32s: think about fairly basic things from first principles. Why is this true? I know some fact is true,
812.44s: and they ask me like, but why? I have to sit there and think, why is that? And reconstructing it
817.16s: from first principles is immensely valuable to me in addition, hopefully, to the person who's asking
822.12s: the question. Which is also really cool because you touched on that in your book about some of
829.40s: the mentorship and tutelage you had, like when you first entered into the industry, could you talk
835.24s: about what some of that was like? What are some of the things that some of your mentors told
840.76s: you? I know a big part you harped on was good decision making, which I'm funny enough,
845.96s: kind of applies to everything. So, could you talk about that a little bit?
850.36s: Yeah, so the thing, I think trading has historically been taught in a very,
856.12s: it will stay soocratic way, where the person who's kind of senior is asking you questions,
862.60s: and hopefully there are good questions in order to make you think and understand things just through
866.44s: your own attempt at finding the answers. So, I think that definitely works. I think the best
873.48s: firms that I know of have done that and maybe put it on steroids by creating like extremely good
880.04s: training programs that kind of take you through the basics in a very structured way that is very
884.44s: useful. It's not a replacement for the other thing, but it's certainly an excellent, I would say.
890.76s: So, yeah, I think a lot of it is just what decisions did you make and why did you make them?
896.20s: And sometimes these decisions are very easy and mechanical and sometimes they're more subtle and
900.68s: like, and they all matter, right? Could you give an example of something that you would consider
908.28s: a good decision versus a bad decision? Obviously, super vague, so it can be about whatever topic you
913.96s: want to talk about. Let's just say that let's say that you have some strategy that
919.96s: says that after earnings stocks do something, right? Like momentum is a very common one. Like
926.44s: it's been talked about in academic circles forever. So, this is probably talk about it. So,
931.64s: like I think this stock is going to have some momentum after earnings. And so, based on what you
936.92s: understand about the stock and about the price action. So far, you might say, okay, well, I think
941.40s: I think it's probably probably like a 50 basis point straight to to sell right now and buy it back
948.60s: in two days for something. Let's just say, right? Like I think it makes 50 basis points.
953.64s: And then you say, okay, well, how big do I want to make do this trade? Like that can be a good trade
959.64s: at $10 million and a herandest trade at $100 million. So, I think a lot of a lot of the
965.32s: problems that retail traders get on a much smaller scale, a lot of the problems they get into is
971.16s: because they size too big. I think it's the easily the number one mistake that your average retail
976.84s: active trader makes is just sizing way too big. As a percentage of your trading capital or whatever
984.36s: denominator you want to put on it, I think most retail traders would be utterly shocked at how small
990.84s: the bets are that large companies put on as a fraction of the amount of money they have out there
996.28s: to trade with. Like for a really large company, a $100 million bet can literally just be like,
1002.12s: I don't know, it's like a percent of whatever. Right? And so what does a percent? That's like a big bet.
1007.00s: Right? We'll say like that's a percent of your trading capital or your available risk capital. That's a
1012.20s: big bet. So what is a percent of somebody with a $100,000 account look like? Right? Well, that's a $1,000.
1018.84s: That's a big bet. Right? I'm not saying that universally true. I'm not saying like one percent
1024.44s: is always huge or anything like that. But the times you see people just kind of get in over their heads
1030.84s: just because like they're sort of destined to go broke because even if they're trade did have edge,
1036.28s: even if they're trade did have edge, your way past like some Kelly fraction or something like that.
1040.36s: Like you're just going to go broke with probability one. Now, as you were talking about that,
1046.44s: it made me think of another concept related to what you're talking about before, which is the idea
1051.80s: that retail traders are even starting the problem set from talking about like controlling the
1056.84s: remoteions or behaving like a fucking adult. So if you were to think about a trader that has those
1066.12s: under control, let's say that they can just behave like a professional. I know shocking concept,
1071.48s: but maybe they don't apply some sort of unique unicorn to trading and they just show up and be a
1076.52s: professional. And they start trying to figure out these sizing protocols. You mentioned something
1084.76s: you know, fractional Kelly, which that's something you and Sinclair talks a lot about,
1088.20s: seeming with each other, back in your spoke with. And it's like a good starting point, what are some
1092.20s: of the tools that a place like Jane Street or some of these other firms use to determine their sizing?
1098.84s: Right. Yeah. So I think we're not getting into too much detail about it. I think you'd certainly
1103.96s: develop an intuition over time about like how big certain trades should be. In this sense of like
1110.60s: this is a good trade. This is not a good trade or this is a very good trade. This is a less good trade.
1115.24s: Like this is roughly the size that we should be the active in. But there's also just absolute limits,
1121.96s: possibly set by internally, possibly set by your prime broker where it's like, listen,
1127.08s: I don't care how good you think this trade is. We're just not going to allow you to do to put a
1131.32s: position on bigger than, I don't know, 50, 50 million dollars and some random stock, right? So I'm
1136.04s: unheaded position in a stock that we're snuck in a little bit. And I think if you don't have a
1140.84s: prime broker, then you should probably think about what those absolute limits are for you as well.
1147.24s: But I think a lot of the value that having a really good set of people with a lot of experience to
1153.64s: discuss this with, and that's kind of what happens at these large firms, is that you can sort of
1159.48s: collectively arrive at something that seems reasonable. Doesn't mean that everybody's going to end
1163.16s: up agreeing, but probably you're not going to go completely off the rails given that that's how you
1169.00s: make this hit it. In one of the things that really sticks out to me anytime I speak with anybody from
1174.76s: the institutional side is it's very clear that there's a lot of structure. There's a lot of different
1179.64s: processes and there's a lot of checks and balances, which obviously is a retail trader, you kind of
1186.20s: become like all of that wrapped into one. So if you were to think about the primary processes
1193.32s: that a retail trader would need to be able to like stand up for themselves to even have a shot at
1199.56s: this thing, what are some of those processes? I actually have started to wonder whether there's any
1206.84s: good universal answer to this. There's some of the other answers that we've already covered, right? Like
1211.32s: there's don't don't size too big, that's one of them. And just all of the standards sort of behavioral
1218.20s: biases that people might be subject to, cutting your winters short and chasing, well, I don't know,
1223.72s: whatever they are. But I think outside of that, part of what I think I've learned is that different
1231.72s: people can operate in pretty different kind of decision-making modes. I have a friend who's
1238.44s: extremely, he is an extremely quantitative guy, PhD in operations research, I think, and what he
1245.48s: what he does now as a solo retail trader is he'll read the news and he'll think about stuff and
1252.52s: he'll sort of say to himself, I wonder what the price of this should be if this is true, and then
1258.36s: he'll go look it up and he's like, I don't know, that doesn't look quite right. Okay, I guess that's a trade.
1264.36s: I don't think that process would work for me, but it obviously works for him, right?
1269.48s: Because it's kind of compatible with how he sort of approaches the whole thing. So yeah,
1274.92s: I don't know if there's any kind of universal, I'm not aware of any universal thing other than
1279.80s: maybe the sizing stuff. Got it. Yeah, and I think when we talk about this too, you
1288.04s: bring in the settlement of like intuition and intuition is tricky because I mean, I come from a military
1295.24s: background and we always say like, you know, you might be 25 years old, but you're in a thousand
1302.20s: year old institution. Like there's warfare has been around for a long time, you can learn a lot
1307.56s: without doing it, but in those kind of institutions that you were in, obviously there's a ton
1314.04s: of just institutional sophistication and knowledge that gets distilled around.
1319.08s: Yep. What are the like most effective methodologies for that information to be shared? Is it when
1326.44s: you both are looking at a screen and just kind of have an occasional conversation, is it through
1330.20s: like some sort of structured process? Yeah, so I think it, I think it varies, but certainly
1336.04s: and I don't think that this is invented. I know it's not invented at trading companies,
1339.96s: in fact, probably the military invented it, which is like we'll say after action reviews or post
1345.16s: more, as whatever you want to call them, right? Like these sorts of ideas of like I did a thing
1350.44s: and then we're going to sit down and we're going to like evaluate our decision-making process,
1354.60s: going into it and what happened and what we missed and what we could have known if, if and what we
1359.72s: couldn't have known. Like sometimes things just go bad for you, right? Like nothing you can do about
1364.12s: those. So that's definitely pretty powerful. I would even say and this is coming, I think,
1370.68s: more from the rationalist community, if I am aware of this, is the idea of a pre-mortem. Like if
1376.36s: you're going to do a big trade or something, it's kind of like if this goes wrong, how's this
1380.12s: going to go wrong, right? I'm sure the military does this too, but it's the idea of like trying
1384.76s: to anticipate what could go wrong and sometimes you can find the mitigation for it, sometimes you can't.
1390.60s: Obviously, you can't look for monsters under the bed sheets either. So the pre-mortem can't be
1395.40s: an exercise and like let's all hold our heads and decide not to do anything, right? But I think
1400.84s: these sorts of processes can I think work pretty well, maybe if you're pretty self-aware on your
1408.60s: own, we have to kind of discipline about doing it. Now, there's a long-standing problem I haven't
1418.52s: been able to solve. So I assume you will have the answer. I am super confident.
1427.88s: So in a lot of my conversations funny, you and I right before we started, I was talking about
1433.16s: a response that I was making to something online about a labor trader, you know, pending,
1439.16s: blowing up. And I find it to be next to impossible to like explain, especially to again, like
1447.88s: newer traders that they're not like too good or a defined small edge. So like you were just talking
1455.16s: about momentum. Momentum, momentum has been around forever. So if you wanted to try to build some sort
1460.68s: of trading system, not saying you're going to necessarily crush or you could crush it, but
1465.40s: at least you're starting with something that's known, well, research and can give you an idea of
1469.08s: what it could look like yet. Most of the time, they're more interested in, you know, just jumping
1476.20s: into some sort of obscure option structure that they believe provides income or edge.
1482.12s: Right. Do you have any tricks in the toolkit or redirecting a wayward trader
1489.96s: towards the lights away from the dark? Right. So I think there's a few
1496.12s: normal, I'd say like fairly standard wayward paths. I think the most common wayward path is
1504.04s: paying for something you shouldn't pay for. Training course, some, like this is going to teach you
1512.52s: the riches. This is a real true strategy that will never go wrong for you if you implement it right.
1518.76s: If it went wrong for you, well, you must not have implemented it right. Like that kind of thing.
1523.00s: I think the best thing that I have for that is what I call the money tree analogy.
1527.96s: And so just like close your eyes, imagine that there's a special plot of land,
1533.32s: which you don't own. You don't own the land, but you do own a tree on that land. And that tree
1540.04s: gives off pure money. Right. That's its fruit. It's just pure money. Fresh Benjamin's, right?
1546.28s: And so of course, the tree, like it grows, right. It sucks a lot of the nutrients out from the ground
1551.64s: in this special plot of land. You can only grow in this special plot of land, right?
1555.72s: So the question is, if you were the owner of that money tree, right? Like you're the person
1559.72s: that owns this tree, but not the land on it, would you sell the tree or would you sell it seeds
1565.40s: in particular? Because like your customers are just going to plant their seeds right next to your
1571.72s: tree and then suck the nutrients out of the ground too, right? So like the analogy, hopefully,
1577.96s: is quite clear if you have a strategy, like there's a gazillion possible strategies out there.
1583.40s: If it's a profitable strategy, it's a pretty specific thing. It probably works in a pretty
1587.00s: specific way. Like that's the special plot of land. And the strategy is the tree that like just
1593.00s: gives off money. Like, would you sell that strategy? Like you just wouldn't, right? Like every
1601.08s: single person that starts doing it beside you is now taking money away from you. So as a buyer of
1607.16s: these sorts of things, you should be extremely suspicious. You should be very suspicious that this
1612.20s: thing actually does make money because if it did, nobody would sell it, right? Like, and people
1618.44s: can say, like the sellers can say all that they want, oh, like I'm just in it to help the little guy
1623.56s: and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It's like, okay, I'm not going to say that's not true, but
1628.44s: my priors and the other direction. And you actually talk a little bit about this, like general
1635.40s: concept to, I found it interesting in your book about learning more so the process of like
1643.40s: good decision making and then being able to apply good decision making to different stuff. So it's
1649.24s: almost like there's value in starting with just good decision making and then not even necessarily
1655.80s: worrying too much about the trading side of it until you feel ready to make that leap. Could you
1662.44s: talk through that a little bit more specifically why in laws of trading you focus so much on the
1668.20s: decision making process versus the the end of the month of fact or post-series announcement
1673.96s: drift or you know these other very specific things. Yeah, so I would say the reason that I focus
1678.92s: on it because it's the most general thing that I can think of because the momentum of effect,
1683.88s: the momentum effect might come and go. Like the post-series announcement drift, it might come
1688.60s: and go. You don't know that those are going to keep working if they still do or if they ever did.
1694.04s: You probably did. But the thing that is generalizable if you're a trader is the ability to get
1701.96s: to make a decision and the ability to get better because that's what's going to allow you to find
1706.36s: the next thing before it appears in a book, before it appears in an academic paper, all of the best
1712.20s: trades are almost by definition things that are not available publicly. That's where the
1718.36s: money is. It's in all the weird stuff that you've discovered that nobody else has. And so that's kind
1724.44s: of how at least I would hope that people can approach the business, right? The business of trading is
1730.84s: being a person who is capable of finding new things, of developing them, and of exploiting them,
1736.92s: and then when it's not as good anymore, finding the next thing. That's a thing that just
1742.76s: generalizes. I think you talked about this in a recent podcast, if I'm not mistaken, but you
1748.92s: were talking about the potential impact of technology AI on starting to consume these smaller spaces
1758.60s: that used to be bastions for retail traders getting into the super-Eliquid dirty biotech
1766.28s: lactar heroin trading, but markets of thin, especially on the derivative side, real thin. So sometimes
1774.20s: there's something there, but you were talking about what that might look like going into the future.
1779.96s: Yeah, so I guess it's a question of cost structure, right? Like if you think about an employee at a large
1786.44s: profitable trading firm, that employee has to bring in a certain amount of trading revenue in
1792.44s: order to be worth employee. That person, let's just say that person's median makes like a million
1798.04s: dollars a year, right? That's what they make between salary bonus, whatever. So that person has to
1803.96s: be bringing in more than a million dollars in order to make that worth it. And so is it worth it
1809.88s: for that company to have one trader dedicated to looking at some illiquid pink sheet crap that
1815.08s: probably makes on a good year, 100k, right? No, right? There's no value to that company.
1822.20s: That, that like it's just sort of beneath the cost floor, right? And so that's an opportunity for a retail
1829.88s: person, right? Now, imagine now that the cost to the company of being able to do that, like the
1836.76s: cost per head, goes down because this person now has access to better tools, AI, whatever,
1841.64s: let's look at a wider range of things and they can maybe aggregate 20 of these 100k little spots,
1848.52s: little niches. Okay, well, now it is worth their time to actually go off and do it. So I think that's
1854.52s: kind of the story of quant trading in many ways is figuring out ways to become more efficient and
1861.40s: kind of add a multiplier effect to human time so that more and more niches become worth pushing into.
1869.72s: So what would you imagine like the next decade might look like for the trading space?
1879.08s: I, so I think a couple of things seem pretty likely. Not necessarily retail trader related
1884.76s: directly, but I think there's going to, there is already actually a consolidation in, in terms of
1893.40s: the the cost of being able to, the technology cost of of doing trading just keeps going up.
1900.04s: You see it most easily in options, I think, where used to be like, you could be a local
1904.04s: in Chicago and kind of, you know, e-cout a living just trading options back and forth.
1909.24s: Now the technology floors just extremely high and so a lot of the smaller
1915.00s: options trading firms in Chicago have been put under pressure, they get bought by bigger places.
1919.72s: So there's a consolidation in trading firms, I think, just because the, the,
1925.64s: kind of non-recurring expensive doing trader trading just keeps going up. Right? So I think that
1930.68s: consolidation is probably going to keep happening. The other big trend I would say in the last
1936.04s: five to 10 years is obviously the rise of just retail traders in general, like there's just a lot
1940.60s: more retail trading out there that has been incredibly profitable for trading large trading firms
1948.12s: is that going to keep happening or is there going to be kind of a snapback or or something where
1957.56s: the average person that's doing this realizes like, no, this is kind of, I'm kind of getting
1963.00s: taken to the clean or slowly. And if that happens then I could definitely see some sort of like
1968.20s: retrenchment in just the profitability of all these firms for a while. So I don't know, I think
1975.32s: that part of it, I think is yet to be figured out. Yeah. The original explosion in retail trading
1984.04s: makes sense, COVID stimulus people home. The persistence of it now starts to lead into gamification,
1994.44s: accessibility. Yep. You, like, if you were to make an over underbet, do you think it continues to
2001.00s: expand from here or do you think it starts to win? Every time I think we're at peak
2007.08s: gambization of society, we manage to go even another step further. Like, oh, yeah, the
2012.20s: CME is going to start listing sports stuff now. Yeah. Right. Like, if if if you had told me that the
2018.28s: CME was going to list sports betting even five years ago, let alone let alone 10, I would have
2023.24s: taken any amount of action against that, right? There's just never ever ever going to happen. No,
2028.28s: it actually just got announced. So I think it's a fool's game to say, like, no, this is it. This
2037.80s: is as big as it's going to get. But at the same time, I think I do see some sort of like,
2043.64s: it's just a vibe maybe that people are starting to realize, like, you know what, this is just kind of
2048.44s: insane at this point. Like, if I can actually make money betting on whether Dilldo's gets thrown
2055.32s: on WNDA and BA floors, like, okay, I think this is gone just to hair too far at this point.
2060.44s: That's the bet that interests me. Now we're talking. As a participant or just as an
2068.60s: interest editor, observer, either or. I mean, I give you can throw them at me. That would be a great
2073.32s: bet. I'll zigzag. Well, it's it's also an interesting for Ray into the larger
2082.60s: prediction markets where, you know, we now have CEOs during earnings calls that at the end of the
2089.64s: earnings call, they're like, oh, yeah, wait, before I wrap up, let me rattle off a few words here.
2094.44s: Do you think that there's any sort of positive effect from so many things being able to be
2107.00s: speculated on? Right. So I think I think in principle, yes, like, it would be good.
2114.36s: One of the things that trading teaches you more than anything else and and trading at a trading firm
2119.72s: will teach you hopefully very well is that a bet is a tax on bullshit, right? Anytime you are
2126.84s: forced to put your money where your mouth is, you start to go like, oh, actually hang on a sec.
2133.00s: Me saying words isn't free. Maybe I should actually figure out whether I believe the words I'm
2137.48s: saying, right? This is a wonderful, wonderful fact about betting betting in about prediction markets.
2143.32s: And we should all be very, very glad that the idea of betting as a tax on bullshit being more
2149.80s: well known in the world, this is good thing. This is a very good thing. I think to the extent that the
2157.80s: the kinds of things that we're paying attention to and betting on are useful and valuable and
2163.48s: important, that's got to be good. To the extent that they are trivial and distracting from things that
2169.40s: are important, probably not so good, right? Be aware of what it looked at it and you took a decent
2178.36s: bet on yourself to like sit down and write a fucking book. That must have been no small task.
2186.04s: What led to that? You spent a little while trading at a firm and then you said, I would like some
2193.64s: pain in my life. Let me do this instead or what will led you there? It's a pain for no money.
2199.56s: Not enough. Yeah. So Eric, just just were to the wise here writing a book, not to the path to
2206.44s: riches for most people. I knew that going in, right? Because I knew that I did not want to write a
2212.60s: trading book that said, hey, like here's a strategy to do X. I wanted to write the trading book that
2217.64s: was more about principles and how you might want to think about things that didn't have any ways
2222.12s: to obvious ways to make money. And so I knew that the audience for a book like that was small,
2227.72s: but I didn't care. A lot of the genesis of the book was training material from when I taught either
2234.76s: interns or new hires, et cetera. It started off just kind of as a little joke. The first law that
2244.52s: I came up with, this was years ago, before I even thought of any book, was the idea that as a
2249.88s: trader, you're never happy with the size you did. Because if it was a bad trade, you should have
2254.60s: done zero. If it was a good trade, you should have done it bigger. No matter what happens, you're
2259.40s: going to be unhappy. I called that the first law of trading. Then I came up with another couple
2267.40s: and thought, okay, well, I can actually organize some kind of teaching around these ideas.
2272.20s: So then when I left, I thought, well, I don't know, this seems pretty general. It's not really
2277.56s: about trading. You see a lot of other things in the world where you look at it from a trader's lens
2283.88s: and it's useful and it's productive to look at it that way. I thought, okay, let's give it a shot.
2290.12s: And why, why a book versus any other medium, because I know that there's also like that's,
2298.04s: I find for myself, like in terms of concentration, like sharing information, I actually prefer
2302.52s: video just because you can convey a lot of information very quickly and easily. You can pick up
2308.04s: subtle cues, writing is super challenging. You have to be very, very methodical, not just in
2313.48s: what you write, but then how the person's going to read it and it's a lot of work.
2317.08s: It is, and I think for me, the part of it was that I wanted that challenge. I wanted to try to
2326.28s: see if I could actually write a book. I wanted to see if I, there's a joke that everybody has a book
2331.00s: in them and for most people that books should just stay there. And I wanted to know if that was the
2337.08s: case for me or if it was okay for it to come out, it doesn't maybe part of it. I also think,
2342.68s: there's sort of this romantic notion if I'm being fully honest with myself, there's this romantic
2346.84s: notion about writing a book just like it was done centuries ago. Could I do that?
2354.68s: I feel somewhat more permanent in some sense. It's probably not the dollar or time maximizing
2361.32s: thing to do. It's fully admit that. Yeah, and it's funny because I actually came across the
2367.72s: economics of books from some of the other people on the podcast that have written books.
2372.68s: It is one of those things where everybody thinks as soon as you write a book,
2375.96s: you are now screwed to MacDoc, you have a lot of old coins to go swim in. But you talked about
2386.92s: you talked about a lot of different stuff in your book. Do you have any examples of laws that
2392.28s: didn't make the book? That were things that you're like this is kind of good by just as a fit.
2397.32s: Yeah, so I think those those laws that didn't make the book either because they were just a little
2403.00s: too trade-free and non-tradery enough, not general enough, ended up as big long tweet threads.
2411.08s: Probably the tweet thread that I think people refer to back the most, even though I wrote it like,
2418.28s: I don't know, maybe four or five years ago now, is this idea that trading is about positioning?
2424.92s: You don't get paid for the trades you do, you get paid for the positions you hold.
2430.52s: So the idea of like, oh, I'm going to do this trade and I'm going to look for an exit, etc.
2436.60s: I'm like, most of the time, I think that's just the wrong way to think about trading.
2439.80s: You should be thinking about all the time, what is the correct position for me to be holding right now?
2445.80s: Then what is the optimal action that I can take given cost, given risk, etc. to get me closer to that correct position?
2454.76s: And so, yeah, the idea of trading not really being about the trade, but about the position,
2460.44s: I think is like a really important fundamental concept that I think a lot of people just kind of get wrong.
2467.00s: Could you explore that a little bit more? Why do you think they get it wrong?
2471.88s: So I think a lot of people talk about like, oh, here's my entry point to my exit point and like, oh,
2478.92s: this is like, I should put a stop loss here and I should take profit here.
2483.48s: I'm not saying those are like obviously wrong and not under all situations, but most of the time,
2488.60s: like when should you exit a position when another one is better? Like, there's no like, oh,
2494.20s: I should exit like five minutes later, I should exit like when it hits this price.
2498.36s: And in particular, what this mindset teaches you is that the world does not care what your entry
2504.60s: price was. And so your exit price should like your exit, you know, decision should not be a function
2512.04s: of when you put it on, right? Like, maybe this trade was was is like, is profitable and maybe it's
2519.16s: unprofitable. But the point is like, if the position now is profitable to hold, then you should hold it.
2524.44s: And if it's not, then you should get rid of it. And the amount of money you made is completely
2529.16s: irrelevant to that decision. To first order, ignoring costs, ignoring risk, etc. Sure.
2534.92s: Let's go first, then. Order stop, right? That opens a fascinating paradox because then there's
2540.76s: the part of it in terms of like risk sizing and making sure that you have a position that does
2546.60s: and end up consuming too much risk. Like you were talking about before, early on, the disposition
2550.44s: effect letting losers run. So how do you think about balancing those two? Yeah, exactly. Right?
2554.68s: So like I said, this principle of like, no, the world doesn't care what price you entered at.
2559.32s: Yes, the world doesn't care, but I'm sure your broker does, right? And so that definitely matters,
2565.56s: right? And but again, I think this gets back to bet sizing. Again, because most of the time,
2572.36s: that should not be much of a, in most of the decisions you make, that should not be a factor.
2577.24s: Right? Like, oh, shit, I have to get out of this position because it's either too big or
2581.72s: it's consuming too much margin or whatever. Like, if that, if you get into that spot fairly often,
2587.64s: then you're just trading too big. Like, most of the time, you should just be doing very boring
2592.60s: trades that don't like enter into like any kind of like big risk calculus. It's just, okay,
2598.12s: yeah, I think this position is, I think this stock is now at its fair value. There's no edge to
2603.24s: holding it. It's just risk with no edge. I should probably try to work out of it. That's it.
2608.28s: Like, that's what, that's what most of your like trading decisions should look like or they are
2613.48s: the opposite, right? Like, oh, I think this stock is undervalued. I should buy some.
2617.32s: Throughout a lot of the conversation, and I find this a lot when I think about trading is like,
2623.24s: it really is about this balance between kind of these competing forces. It seems like a continual
2629.00s: balancing act. What are some of the tools that you learn either, you know, in your institutional
2635.32s: career or just throughout your life in general that help you to create that balance? Because it
2640.20s: really requires the ability to like switch quickly between different perspectives and then, you know,
2645.24s: find a center point. You talked a little bit about, sorry, you just said, yeah, before you talk
2651.56s: a little bit about using other people, right, to help with that decision making process. But let's
2656.04s: forego that point. Let's pretend that you're alone on an island, I guess, in a computer,
2662.20s: what, thanks Elon, Starlink, whatever. Yeah. But yeah. So for me, this is where the fact that I am
2669.48s: not a discretionary trader and never have been is probably where I start to become a not very
2676.60s: useful resource to answer this question. Because my answer is always going to be like, you did all the
2681.88s: work before, right? Like you define the strategy, you defined everything upfront. Like this is what I
2688.68s: think the strategy should do. This is what I think it's sizing function should be like this is what
2692.36s: I think it's risk-linit should be like, like, that's it. Like now I'm done. Like it's running.
2698.92s: Right. It's doing whatever it is it does. And periodically, depending on the strategy, maybe,
2704.20s: I don't know, once a week, once a month, once every six months, I should like run this analysis
2708.92s: again, like maybe build a new model or or analyze my trading and make sure that like the thing that
2714.92s: happened is the thing that the model kind of said should have happened. Like, is it was this an
2719.64s: outlier performance when we're another? Like, that's sort of metal-level stuff. Yeah, you should
2723.48s: be doing some of that. But sort of day to day, a huge advantage with a systematic approach,
2728.52s: which is all the trading that I've ever done, is that you don't really get into this like,
2733.56s: oh, like, what decision should I make now? Like, what should I do? It's just like, I don't know,
2738.60s: I already defined it all. It's just it's running. And that's hard in the sense that you have to have
2745.56s: a lot of confidence in the work you did upfront, but it's easy because day to day, it's easier
2751.80s: day to day, because then you don't have to exhaust yourself with actually making decisions,
2755.88s: but then it's hard again because if it's having a bad day, you just have to let that right,
2761.24s: like, vote for the most part. It's funny because it's started that you said, you know,
2765.72s: it's not necessarily the most useful answer, but the funny thing is is that's actually incredibly
2769.64s: useful because if you think about the path, especially of retail, OST them you doing that,
2776.28s: right, which is confounding to say, but most of them aren't even thinking about kind of devising
2782.04s: the system before they do it. They're just kind of like, oh, I learned iron condors. Let me go,
2786.04s: we go sell some of those and make a bunch of money. So here's the thing, just because this is a
2791.72s: hobby horse of mine and I'm just going to jump on it. The idea of options strategies as
2798.84s: as there's ultimate public is like, batshit crazy. And I'll tell you why. Okay, like, the whole
2806.84s: thing about options and options strategies is that this is a linear operation, right? So like,
2812.20s: you cannot take two losing trades and some them and turn it into a winning trade, right? So like,
2819.24s: if whatever complex strategy you've come up with is a profitable trade, then at least one of those
2825.88s: legs has to be profitable. Okay? Maybe all four or five or eight of the legs that you're
2832.84s: engaging in are profitable legs of the option strategy, but I bet you they're not. I bet you like,
2839.08s: if it's profitable at all, I bet you one of them is profitable and I bet you three of them are
2843.88s: losing you money. And so maybe you should think about doing the profitable thing and not do the
2849.40s: things that don't lose you money and manage risk a little bit better and you'll probably come out
2853.32s: better in the end. I think we got to clip that part specifically because I spent a lot of time
2859.72s: talking about structure strategy and the multi-leg, omnidrag in that people build. So I really
2866.68s: glad you mentioned that. Now talk to me a little bit about the broad process to creating a strategy.
2875.72s: And I know there's a lot that goes into that, but if you were to think of like the major muscle
2879.56s: movements and how you go about that, what does that look like, at least at the institutional side of
2884.68s: stuff? Yeah, so I think it depends a little bit on on what you're good at. And I think it
2888.60s: this gets back to the first thing that we talked about, which is like really being self-aware about
2892.28s: what is the differential edge that you have in the market or that you might have in the market?
2897.16s: And so years ago the way I tried to think about and come up with strategies was something that
2905.24s: I actually enjoyed doing a lot of, which is just staring at ticks. Like I would literally just stare at
2909.72s: the book like this, like I would stare at it. Now would see like, oh, like that dude like
2914.68s: Penny that other dude and then this other guy came down a little bit and then like these were
2918.76s: pretty illiquid stocks. We're not talking ESR into you. We're talking stuff where you can actually
2923.24s: see it in real time. And then like oh, oh, like five-lock guy, he's back, right? Like oh,
2928.84s: where is he in the book? Oh, he's up there. Oh, he's kind of taken up, right? And so this would sort of
2934.12s: give you ideas about about like just things you might want to to try. And so then and so then
2941.56s: to the batmobile, right? Like and where the batmobile is this like massive trove of data that you
2946.68s: have collected for the last 10 years. And all of the tooling that lets you like just really, really
2951.72s: quickly study an idea and do it properly and not fool yourself and not have looked ahead bias and
2957.64s: all this stuff. And 98% of the time you would do this and be like oh yeah, okay, that doesn't make any
2963.00s: money, right? Like it better than just incinerating money by random we fit the coin, but that's not
2969.64s: like just not helping anyone, right? Everyone's in a wild. You will come up, come up with something
2975.00s: where it's like oh, actually I think there's like I think there's something here, but I think it's a
2978.92s: little piece of a larger pattern. And then you so I used to do that a lot, right? Like I used to really
2983.64s: stare at text a lot and and I got a lot of ideas only a tiny fraction of which we're good,
2988.68s: out of doing that. I think now the company I'm at now, that is very much not the approach. The approach
2995.48s: is very much a all in-depth on machine learning where there's no like human's staring at ticks.
3002.52s: It's it's much more meta-level like how can we construct the machine that figures it out on its own.
3007.64s: And so I certainly had to adapt kind of how I think about things a little bit in this sort of
3011.96s: new world, but it's it's just as fun. Yeah, talk to me a little bit about the the new project.
3018.92s: I know that you can't go super far in a detail, but that is a completely different way of thinking.
3024.04s: So how have you melded with that so far? Yeah, so the company it's a small trading start-up
3029.96s: here in Prague, which is where I live now. And it was founded by a bunch of X-D-Mind scientists.
3036.60s: Like they were they were the ones who built the first poker agents that could beat humans.
3042.44s: And then they unified it with the deep my day-gen's that were the best at chess and like
3048.28s: these sort of had this sort of game playing reinforcement learning background and they thought,
3052.84s: okay well let's try trading. Now there's like a long history of academics and other people
3057.16s: saying, oh just apply my cool technique to trading and that often doesn't go well.
3061.96s: But I think these guys are obviously I thought obviously that these guys really had something
3068.12s: and the reason I say that is because I would say in traditional
3071.72s: quant we'll say machine learning style quant trading you have this idea of a big huge system
3079.40s: that produces a fair value. Like what is the thing that I think that I'm trading worth right?
3085.48s: And then you have another system that's like a bunch of human juristics that say like how do I
3089.16s: turn that fair value into a set of trades that I should do in order to exploit that knowledge right?
3095.00s: I guess the idea of the company is using reinforcement learning we can just learn all of that
3100.36s: end to end. So like data comes in decision making agent comes out and it's up to us to sort of
3107.08s: figure out the algorithms that make the training algorithms that make that make money and not lose money.
3115.00s: The fascinating part of that is it almost reminds me of spoofing actually where there's probably
3121.40s: a lot of other people doing this and so the information works by asked I asked these guys it's like
3128.36s: how do you know that this agent that you're training isn't going to do some illegal shit?
3132.12s: Yeah, they're really good. Absolutely, like you hit the nail on head right when you
3138.20s: part of the reason the huge part of the reason that the quant trading has been divided into this
3142.44s: like figure out a fair value and then have a bunch of jurists have turned it into trades
3146.12s: is that humans can look at these juristics and say like that thing is doing something it shouldn't
3150.04s: right when you sort of handed over to the machine and the machine maybe discovers like
3154.84s: a way to second like if I put out a huge bid here and a tiny off you know like you could totally
3159.56s: figure that out right it probably would and so part of the challenge for us is making sure that the
3166.28s: machine absolutely does not do that and we have some approaches to that to sort of cracking that
3174.52s: but yeah like that is an absolutely a huge concern with systems like this.
3179.96s: In how do you think about the concern maybe your guys this machine and model is doing what
3185.40s: it's supposed to but what about everybody else that might be doing this and whether or not they
3190.20s: play by the same rule? Yeah so I guess I'm not super concerned about what other people are doing
3197.32s: if our agent makes money like if our agent's making money and we know that we're not doing anything
3202.04s: even remotely close to illegal and doing so then then all all is good and believe me like
3208.68s: regulators and brokers etc all have an incredibly large interest in making sure that you're not
3214.12s: doing anything stupid and if you're in this game for the long haul you have a very big interest
3218.92s: in not doing anything stupid. So I'm actually not super concerned about that I think the
3224.20s: interesting question and there's been there have been cases in the past where a very very
3228.92s: very sensible strategy from your like human rules I'm saying a very sensible strategy from your
3235.00s: bot or your machine in or axe in a weird way with a very sensible strategy from another guy
3242.12s: and the sort of the emergent behavior is supposed to look really really bad so like let me
3247.88s: give you a classic example if you have time so I think it's yeah please instruct it so let's say that
3253.08s: your your your machine is a market maker in a very illiquid very wide stock right and so
3259.88s: if it's very illiquid and very wide like probably you want to be like the best bid right let's just say
3265.32s: like you want like this is the good side the bid side is the good side right so like whoever's got a bit
3270.44s: out there you just penny them right but the thing is like your your opponent the other market
3275.72s: maker has the same strategy and so then like he pennies you and then you penny them and then he
3281.00s: pennies you and so you do this like what we just call it the penny war we like where they just kind of like
3285.96s: you see it in the market data like do do do do do do do do and then one of them says oh wait a second
3290.44s: this is way too much I'm canceling and then the other guy sees oh there's nobody behind me I can
3294.52s: go back down to here and so you see this like sought to of pennying in these little quick stocks
3300.60s: regulators hate seeing that it looks horrible it just looks like manipulation it looks like
3307.64s: every bad thing you could imagine even though both agents are doing very very sensible things
3313.24s: and so you obviously have to like write in some logic to detect like whether your machine is in a
3318.52s: penny war so that it like learns not to get into a penny war just part of the game
3325.16s: and I have to imagine like those kinds of problems just cascade and to like that's a simple
3331.24s: example right so it's just got to become that this massively huge problem set to deal with so
3338.28s: when you're approaching problems there do you find that it's kind of like you're working on a
3344.44s: specific piece with the broader context in mind like how do you even start that process?
3350.04s: Yeah I mean I think it you sort of go up and down the abstractions pretty frequently right like
3358.84s: sometimes you're you're really really in the weeds like like what's our latency to this like what
3363.88s: how can we make this like you know microcyte and faster whatever like it's a tiny tiny problem
3368.76s: you're super focused on and then sometimes you zoom all the way out to like well what should we
3373.64s: be trading in six months or or 12 months or or 18 months like where you know what's the next
3378.52s: thing to attack like and and just everything up and down the scale um I think the way we approach it
3384.60s: is in a very collaborative way like we we definitely think of ourselves as trying to construct
3391.40s: a shared mental model of what we're doing and what's important and what and like what's going on
3397.24s: so that people can sort of self-organize and kind of divide the work naturally that way instead of
3402.68s: having a bunch of managers and stuff yeah yeah and obviously you feel like you guys have to have
3408.68s: some sort of competitive advantage against all of the other firms that you're talking about
3413.00s: what like obviously can't go super far into detail but what's the essence of that yeah so I would say
3419.96s: to be clear we have a lot of disadvantages being a small company like we're definitely less
3425.64s: you know well funded than than the big boys um but I think one of our advantages is that we can move
3431.56s: very very quickly like we we're very small and if we can keep velocity high then we can adapt
3439.08s: not necessarily to market conditions or anything like that but we can sort of adapt what we're doing
3443.48s: hopefully quicker than others I think that's maybe one thing um and the other thing is we believe
3450.20s: this idea of like end to end training of an agent is is the way of the future but the problem is
3457.56s: it's what I call the codac problem for a lot of existing very profitable companies where like you
3462.60s: can't really kill the golden goose on your way to try to do this new thing and so we're organized
3468.28s: from day one to do it this way right if that bed is correct then we should be able to move faster
3473.48s: than others and get there before others if that bed is wrong then like we go out of business and
3478.52s: we lose everything so it's like it's fine right but that's that's the startup right right no it
3484.28s: it makes a ton of sense because it's like a more sophisticated higher capitalized version of
3491.72s: a retail trader but not quite the same size as institutions because that's one of the benefits
3497.32s: of the very few that retail traders have is you could be completely long and then immediately flip
3502.60s: completely short and just a couple seconds with consulting nobody so there is a little bit of
3507.64s: advantage to speed there so it makes complete sense that you guys are like to exploit that funny enough
3513.40s: that's generally the Marine Corps philosophy is speed so yeah I think that that resonates really
3521.88s: well I had just a couple more questions for you the first one specifically is when you think about
3529.88s: the book that you wrote I've never written a book so I've never had the experience but I'm guessing
3537.32s: you might be an experience where you look back at it and there's something in there you're like
3542.44s: a fucking nail that and then there's something that you're probably like I wish I did that slightly
3547.08s: different yeah is that true and if so could you share with those are yeah so I would say
3555.48s: I think the chapter on edge I think I really like I think it holds up I think the
3565.16s: yeah so it's interesting like when you're at an institution like you drink the cool aid and I'm
3571.56s: that saying that's a bad thing right but you just sort of have a way of looking at the world
3575.96s: and ever since I wrote the book I've met so many people and that sort of expanded my notion of
3581.56s: what the landscape of profitable trading can look like and so especially when I talk about like in the
3588.12s: last chapter like adaptation and when I talk in the first chapter actually about like why are you even
3593.00s: doing this why are you even trading I think there's stuff there that I would I would probably say I
3599.56s: am too dogmatic about that I have a perspective that is probably a little bit too narrow
3607.08s: relative to what I think is reasonable now. There enough and as expected from any high performance
3613.40s: person I've ever met I do it does not miss me that you spent way more time on the negative thing
3619.64s: than the positive thing the positive thing was like a sentence so I want to point that out to
3625.40s: other people because that's a really common trait that I find with people like we do that the
3630.12s: military and obviously people that we're trying to do well right you spend a little more time there
3634.52s: which is funny. The other thing I wanted to just probe you on slightly is if you were to speculate
3645.40s: on what the world of institutional trading will look like over the next five ten years how is that
3653.56s: landscape going to change do you see consolidation do you see more spreading out from I would say
3659.24s: this is like your consolidation but consolidate I think the investment banks will continue to get
3665.64s: disintermediated like a lot of stuff that that used to go through investment banks doesn't go through
3671.16s: investment banks like trading companies are are now like making VC investments that was like unheard of
3680.52s: ten years ago right but now they do it all the time right they used to go through some investment
3686.12s: bank and some vehicle or something to you know if they even did it at all or maybe it was the owners
3691.16s: of the company that did it outside of that vehicle now they do it too so I think like risk capital
3697.88s: should probably always for the most part live with the people taking the risk and I think that's
3704.04s: just going to continue to be the case and I think as these companies become more successful and
3709.24s: larger they're just going to sort of keep eating away at more of what this like these like
3715.32s: investment banks that are now public companies like that's not the right structure for this kind
3720.20s: of risk taking like public companies are should not be in the business of of doing that sort of stuff
3725.24s: and yeah like and banks have become these incredibly boring incredibly regulated institutions that
3729.64s: we're nothing happens it's probably actually good for the world so that's definitely a trend that
3735.48s: will probably continue I think obviously they're still room to run in terms of middle income
3744.28s: countries getting richer and getting more kind of yeah like moving up the scale and they're
3750.28s: being people there like like a really a growing middle class that then obviously is thinking about
3755.24s: their future and investments there so I think the developing world still has a lot of growth
3761.56s: left in it like a lot so I think that's that's going to be great for the world. I love that
3769.64s: two last ones seconds last looks like a really good piece of advice that you've got and
3776.28s: literally from anywhere that has helped you in the different pursuits that you had and it's
3783.08s: broad but you do have a really interesting background right you've balanced between like really
3788.76s: different things some same but some different yeah talking about that yeah so I think a thing that
3796.76s: I feel like I've learned is and I think I maybe I've said it before on other podcasts but I
3801.40s: still definitely believe it is life is long like life isn't short life is long like you have time
3807.80s: to to dive into something and get really really really into it and hopefully get really good at it
3813.88s: and get become an expert at it and then you can go do something else and get really good at that thing
3819.96s: too and it's not and the thing I hope that I've discovered is that the thing you were doing 12 years
3826.04s: ago somehow informs the thing you're doing now like it might seem like it's a completely different
3831.40s: thing but it all sort of combines it all helps and so this idea Chris I've done this he who's a friend
3840.84s: he said he sort of he put the finger on it he said oh yeah you're just doing serial PhD after
3847.40s: serial PhD it's just you're not doing it in a university and that's actually fairly accurate like my
3854.12s: my number appears to be roughly six years like I seem to do like I seem to make a big change every
3858.60s: six years or so so I don't know but seems like a pretty good way to go I think it's huge and I actually
3867.32s: resonate with that quite heavily from like bouncing between things looking for new experiences so
3873.72s: what do you think is next obviously you're in your current thing and you know that will sustain
3879.32s: for however along but what else interests you yeah look I mean if this if this goes well I'll definitely
3884.12s: be here for for a few years um I think there's just a lot of this could be a really big company this
3890.28s: could be really something interesting but after that I don't know I think I I dream of
3899.96s: figuring out a way to to help young people start their own companies and and what I mean by that isn't
3908.76s: like oh just like right a bunch of angel checks or something like that but I think one of the things
3914.28s: that I'm reasonably good at is is like town identification and that sort of thing I would like to
3919.88s: figure out how to like put together little groups of like three or four like young super smart
3925.80s: knowledgeable people and just kind of like kind of given the kick and interaction and maybe some
3931.08s: money and it's like okay now like go like this is your thing and like find the next group of three or four
3935.72s: people that like would work together well as a team and then like they go off and do their thing I think
3941.32s: that might be like a good semi retirement thing to to do for a while what a cool project too
3947.56s: because you'd learn a lot about a ton of different stuff which is absolutely awesome exactly yeah so
3954.36s: we covered actually quite a lot and first I genuinely want to thank you because you're also
3958.44s: want to completely different times zone so I know that the timing is a little tricky but first
3963.64s: thank you so much for coming to hang out I do have on my notes that we kind of missed the fast
3969.00s: easy money part maybe we circle back to that we we get that in the few we just forgot about it
3973.88s: obviously it's there but it's just wasn't here yeah on that's something to think you know one of the
3980.60s: one of the most important things for me you know might sometimes I come off as like irascible and
3985.96s: and like ill tempered on Twitter it's not really my intent it's just that it really really
3993.08s: like deeply deeply offends me when I see like people getting scanned
3998.52s: by and like in trading is one of those places where it happens a lot like people just get
4004.60s: scanned because they don't like you can't get scanned like from from a language teacher like I'm
4012.44s: learning check right now I'm trying to I'm failing at it but I'm trying to like if my language
4017.56s: teacher is like bad or isn't doesn't know the language I will find out the second I go to the
4023.16s: store and I try to say something like I'll be able to tell right whereas like the person you're
4027.96s: buying some trading instruction from like you're probably just not going to be able to tell if
4033.96s: it's a scam or not until much later and many many dollars later and that's part of why these
4039.16s: scams just kind of keep popping up come again and again and again so it's it's actually funny I
4046.52s: mentioned it earlier that I didn't really get into YouTube to like do this stuff but it ended up
4051.88s: on kind of becoming a thing funny enough it's it's actually for that exact reason because I grew up
4059.24s: relatively poor and the thing that gets me the most is that the people that are getting scams
4065.24s: are the ones that don't have the money to get scanned so you're literally they're literally
4070.04s: playing on people's like literal dreams and taking a fucking money which drives me crazy so
4075.80s: I actually love the personality fuck those guys so I say the more you could do it keep up the fight
4082.84s: for folks that want to get a hold of you you're on X so I can obviously throw a link to your profile
4089.32s: in the notes is there anywhere else that you want to direct people to your book I'll throw a link to that
4093.88s: yeah boss of trading I think yeah I mean my DMs are open at least I think they are so
4099.88s: you know happy to the people want to ask questions or want to talk or whatever
4103.80s: I'm usually pretty accessible for what you ask for but okay you've heard it here first you could
4109.56s: show up to his house and talk trading so on that and I'm just kidding absolutely awesome hanging out
4115.88s: man definitely look forward to catching up I hope you enjoy the rest of your weekend and thanks for
4119.80s: sharing some of your knowledge and time all right thanks all right really enjoyed it be guys
