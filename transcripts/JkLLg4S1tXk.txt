0.00s: What's up, outliers?
1.60s: Got another email asking to look at DJT again in a couple comments asked if we could look
6.36s: at a few times leading into the election, which makes sense to me happy to do so.
10.68s: And there was actually a couple of things that happened yesterday that I thought were
14.44s: really interesting and I want to talk about it.
17.64s: So first here you can see on the chart, we have spy cues and IWM.
23.72s: And you can see over the last two days, spy has been running slightly negative.
28.64s: IWM has been running negative and cues got a little bit of a bite today and yesterday
34.80s: had a pretty big down day.
37.24s: And then notice DJT, it is up on yesterday hitting new highs and today it's hanging out
45.44s: round about there as well.
47.44s: So what's going on here and why do I find this interesting?
49.76s: Well, it tells us a few things definitively.
52.32s: Now we have a lot of ideas around DJT and how that's behaving and whatnot.
57.20s: But from a broad perspective, this is adding a pretty significant clarifying structure,
64.60s: which is there is pure speculation going on right now and this is being used as speculation
72.40s: to the probability of winning an election.
75.00s: Now I think most people already generally thought that, but the reason why it's so interesting
80.20s: now is that this isn't just following along with general market beta and adding a little
85.40s: bit of spice on top of it.
87.40s: This is now decoupled slightly in the near term from broad market beta, right?
93.16s: Because you can see on the 17th, spy has hit a high and it's actually been rolling over
98.00s: a little bit here.
99.32s: And if you take a look at the 17th, what's happened in DJT is just going up.
104.44s: So that's interesting.
105.92s: Seeing breakdowns and correlation like that and this now being used quite literally
110.52s: is a speculative measure on election outcome probabilities.
114.80s: Which again, for those that are unfamiliar, you can use prediction markets, things like
120.40s: polymarket to get an idea of what this might look like.
123.48s: So if we go in here, check out the presidential election right now, it's showing about a 64
129.60s: percent probability of Trump against the 36 percent probability of Harris pretty close.
137.40s: And the reason why I say pretty close is because these relationships can move diverge
141.96s: and converge very quickly.
144.20s: As you can see back here, it was really blown out to the other direction and Harris's
150.72s: narrated quite a bit back and forth.
152.96s: And now we're definitely diverging again right now, but we are not in 90, 10 level.
160.64s: So that part in and of itself is a little bit interesting to me in terms of just prediction
166.28s: market probabilities.
167.28s: Now a couple notes about prediction markets is they're not perfect.
170.20s: And these are not super liquid markets yet.
172.92s: So if you look at this, there's $2.4 billion in volume.
179.04s: And the reason why it's important to emphasize in volume is because we don't know buys or
184.68s: sales opening, closing trades being moved around.
188.76s: That matters quite a lot.
190.60s: The other thing that I find interesting is that if we take a look at the polls, national
194.72s: polls show Harris with an edge 48.2 percent against Trump at 47.
200.16s: Those are interesting because the polls tend to capture a certain audience and markets
205.08s: tend to capture a different audience.
207.60s: So the truth likely lies somewhere in the middle, which again, we will have to see.
213.40s: Now going back to DJT though, there's a few things that I want to talk about next.
219.04s: So first let's get over to a chart and let's show just where it's hanging out, which
223.28s: again is near highs and it's maintaining this really aggressive volume.
228.36s: The five day and the 20 day average volume has essentially been consistently growing from
235.04s: all the way back here in the beginning of October, just expanding writ large.
241.76s: And today it's the 20 day average volume is now at 37.6 million shares.
246.48s: The five days all the way up to essential, like 43.
249.92s: So really strong volume and the other thing that's kind of interesting is the lock up
254.72s: period for DJT expired a little while ago.
258.36s: And there's not like this insane sailing volume.
261.12s: There's definitely some likely attributed to that, but not a ton.
264.96s: A couple other things that I note here is look at the volatility.
268.96s: It's continuing to expand even more.
271.72s: So implied volatility right now is 306 percent now.
274.84s: When I did a video on this like two days ago, it was like 300 percent.
278.72s: IV percentiles 98 percent.
280.56s: So it is very, very much just pin near highs.
285.20s: Now if we take a look at average true range for the five days, 7.45 percent.
291.60s: 20 days, 8.3 90 day is 7.43.
296.00s: So the interesting thing that I pick up from here is that we are now getting into a probably
302.88s: very volatile period until we get into the election here.
306.32s: You can look at the expected move on a monthly timeframe, which is like 88 percent.
310.88s: And same absolute, absolute move.
312.96s: This is likely going to be a binary event, meaning for this stock.
317.28s: If Trump wins, this is likely to get a decent move.
322.40s: But how much of a move is going to be tricky?
324.24s: Because there's going to be a lot of people selling into that move.
327.44s: And if Trump loses, this is probably going to drop like a freaking rock.
331.68s: Because everybody's going to be dumping out.
333.52s: Because it's essentially tripled in value from the middle slash end of September.
339.92s: And there's been very little change in the fundamental picture of this.
344.24s: So this being used as an election proxy is very interesting to me.
348.56s: Now if we pop over to the trade tab, you can see the volatilities around 8 and 15
354.56s: know of just being astronomically high.
357.28s: I have a position out in 15 know of the reason why I use 15 know of compared to 8 know of
363.04s: is literally just because it's more liquid.
365.44s: The weeklies in this case are still very liquid, but they're still not as liquid
370.16s: as the standard monthly expiration.
372.40s: If you take a look at the 8 November expiration, there's 20,783 calls against 35,000 puts.
379.20s: And if you go to 15 know, it's 156 to 152.
383.12s: So there's lots of people playing this different ways.
385.92s: Now I want to show you another thing that I found, which is over here
392.56s: from unusual whales.
394.64s: And there is a couple really interesting movements this week, one of which is on the 23rd,
401.20s: we can see that there was a couple interesting trades to me.
405.60s: Let's say.
406.56s: So we have a few bids at the 37 calls and we can see some of these are actually pretty
413.12s: large trades near a million dollars over a million dollars.
416.24s: Then we can also see these are longer term up here out in 2026.
422.24s: And these trades are interesting because I don't fully understand
427.60s: what the game plan is here, like why they would go out to 26 for these 20s.
433.12s: But I mean, that's a 2.3 million dollar trade, which is interesting enough.
438.40s: But it's had some really heavy overall premium volume so far this week.
444.64s: And you can see that there's stuff transacting, put side, call side.
448.80s: It's a little bit of a shotgun blast.
451.20s: And I think it's because you're going to see two very different things going on here.
455.44s: There's going to be people trading DJT as a directional thesis
459.92s: for what's going to happen with the election.
461.60s: Again, either upside or downside.
463.20s: But the other thing that you're going to see here are people using DJT as a hedge
468.56s: for the rest of their portfolio.
470.48s: Again, depending on what they think may or may not happen
473.68s: going through the election.
475.20s: So the fact that there's this stock that is being used in a lot of different ways around
479.84s: this binary event. And let's go back to the fact that the stock is not really designed to be
485.28s: an election proxy. So there's going to be fascinating movement that comes from this
490.88s: literally because of those reasons.
492.88s: Now leading into the rest of the election, the question to me becomes, where does this go?
497.92s: How high is reasonable for this based on again, no change in fundamentals and how much
506.08s: how much FOMO is going to lead to people dumping into more of this because I had originally
511.68s: started scaling in just a little bit based on some of these really large average daily
517.20s: range breakouts. And I'm just holding a small position to kind of follow through with it.
522.08s: But I'm sitting here left wondering, I just how far does this run into the election?
527.92s: It's coming up pretty soon. So I have to imagine we're getting near where this might land.
532.16s: But options can help us understand that.
535.28s: So if we go to the Analyze tab and we go to the probability analysis, take a look at this
540.24s: skew, right? So normally you would see this as more of a normal distribution. But this is obviously
547.36s: very, very skewed all the way out here to the downside. But in the near term, it's actually skewed
552.32s: a little bit to the upside. So if we take a look at, let's say over the next week,
558.00s: let's take a look at the probability of a touch. It has a, and this is a one-stand deviation move.
564.80s: So it's going to use around a 16% probability. And as a 16% probability of being all the way out to
571.20s: 60 or 17. So the upside skew potential in this is massive, which is why people like me who don't
579.92s: really care to use this as it's being used right now are still willing to speculate. And it's because
584.72s: of this skew and probabilities. So this thing is going to be on wheels coming up without a doubt.
591.92s: And look at the compression around like the 43% probability range and stuff like that. It is just
598.40s: really, really crunch down 300% vol will do that. But again, you can see essentially out,
606.08s: let's see when this starts to flip over. Because all the way out here so far to 60 days,
611.60s: there's still definitely upside skew and it's only because it can only go down so far.
616.08s: But then it starts to really peak and roll back over, which I again, I just find that generally
622.64s: interesting based on the overall perception of what we might see coming into the election.
629.28s: So looks like volatility is the name of the game going forward. We will see what this looks like
636.32s: as always anything you want me to take a look at. Let me know. Be an outlier. I'll see you all later.
