0.00s: Hey, everyone, Eric here. Welcome back to the outlier podcast. And I am here with a great
8.70s: referred friend. I'm sure we're going to have a great conversation, but Richard
12.80s: freezing and I actually learned about you via my good buddy Kyle from two bulls podcasts
18.24s: like I was telling you and he had nothing but great things to say about you. And that
22.96s: made me literally elated because I had a chance to look over some of your work, which
28.08s: will get into your background in just a second. And I literally loved it. Like I love
31.68s: what you're talking about. I love the angle that you bring to this. So first and foremost,
36.00s: welcome to the channel. Thank you for hanging out for a bit.
38.00s: Well, it's really great to be here and I certainly we certainly have mutual respect for
42.64s: Kyle. And I got a feeling we're going to have a creative conversation. So the question
48.64s: is, will an hour be enough? But let's go for it and see what we can do.
54.96s: Well, you know, just a minor correction about that respect towards Kyle. I don't know if you
60.00s: know this, but he's in the Navy. I'm in the Marine Corps. So it is in my DNA to make sure that I
64.80s: insult him in some sort of way. Okay. Yeah. So it's like it's kind of respect, but maybe not.
71.76s: But just just kidding. I love Kyle. So I had a chance to look over some of your background
77.20s: and stuff, but I always like to kind of get it from the individual, right? Because nobody
82.32s: knows you better than you. And I saw that you spent time on the Pacific Stock Exchange. I saw
89.12s: that you kind of had time in the sea bot, CME, Merrill Lynch. You kind of you've done a lot of
94.16s: things. So I would love to just start with maybe like a high level overview of how you got started
100.64s: in the markets and just your career path overall. Because I think that that helps set a good
106.08s: foundation for people to understand your perspective. Well, let me be really brief. And I was
112.96s: going, I was a Wheaton College just Quester Chicago. It's a Christian evangelical school.
118.32s: And there I met Joe Richie, who founded Chicago Research and Trading. He was one of the foremost
126.08s: innovators in option theory and option valuation and trading and did very well with him.
132.64s: And when my wife got tired of living in Chicago, why? What's the problem?
139.68s: So we came back to California and I opened my own firm on the Pacific Exchange.
148.80s: But leading up to that was Merrill Lynch and working with retail customers.
156.96s: And then when I built my own firm, I was working with traders. I
163.04s: trained them according to a methodology of trading options, futures and stocks.
168.40s: And we were just we just hit singles and occasionally a double. Very careful.
173.92s: It was grinded out and we were doing very well. Except some traders, well, some traders would
183.52s: just take the method and just take off. And some traders would do okay, not great. But some traders
189.68s: just wouldn't make it. And that's where my interest was in what is the mindset that makes the
195.52s: difference. And I have told my story many times about my own mindset limitations. But once I was
201.84s: there and the nice thing about trading is that it gives you immediate feedback. Reality is
209.04s: hard and fast. Whereas if you, let's say, a career for an attorney or a doctor, there's a while
216.72s: there you get some feedback as to what you're doing. So using that hard and fast feedback,
222.40s: then I developed a therapeutic and coaching methodology to work with traders and entrepreneurs
229.28s: and business people who want to expand their opportunities and their growth and
237.36s: and invite them into a mindset that makes that possible.
242.56s: I love that. And it's actually really cool with your options background because that's actually
247.04s: probably one of my primary trading vehicles. So I'm definitely looking forward to diving into
252.64s: that side of things just a little bit. But before that, one of my initial questions is to understand
257.68s: the jump from a very technical math based world of derivatives to something as nebulous as mindset.
267.84s: What precipitated that transition for you? Well, the transition was really from a therapist,
275.68s: which I was originally started family and individual therapy. And then Joe invited me,
282.96s: Joe Richie of CRT invited me to Chicago and I thought, oh, I don't know enough yet. So I joined
287.60s: Merrill Lynch first and then went there. So Rich, for reason, philosophy, major, master's
291.84s: green clinical psychology, a guy who has been identified with Don Quixote.
300.40s: And so I went to work for Joe and that was the real transition. In fact, my trainer in Chicago on
312.32s: the Chicago Mercantel Exchange told me that I was the worst trainee he had ever had.
322.96s: So that was the difficult transition to actually be able to focus. And eventually,
330.72s: when you create enough repeated behaviors, you know, you get into a rhythm. But also with my philosophy
339.36s: and psychology background, I was really looking, what are the underlying factors that can create
345.20s: trading behaviors that are successful? So for two, three years, on the trading floor, I have pictures
353.52s: of it. We have these trading cards. They're kind of heavy-duty cards. You can write on you, write
358.08s: your trades and you keep track of things. So I just kept a really small print. Everything I noticed,
364.48s: everything I felt, all my emotions, the emotions of other traders, the mistakes they make,
369.44s: the smart ones, what they did. And after a couple of years, I just stack almost a foot high,
376.00s: both sides, tiny print. And that turned out, oh, I have it there. But into a trading manual and a
381.92s: binder that I used to trade my traders. And again, the deciding factor was not intelligence.
391.92s: It was their mindset. And so now that I'm 70, oh my god, I'm 76 this year.
403.12s: Thank you. But at this age, what can I do? And that is share the mindset. And so I created
411.84s: a specific set of exercises and processes to take people from traders who think that they can
424.16s: just do it immediately, that they're smart enough engineers, sometimes doctors and lawyers who
430.88s: are able to shape the world because of their presence. Market doesn't give a shit.
437.20s: So those principles then have turned into a trading system and personal coaching that I use.
447.04s: And we've been very successful and have a lot of happy clients.
451.36s: That's awesome. So why the move from kind of family, psychology focused work to trading? Why not
463.92s: sports? Why not big business? Like why trading for you?
469.04s: Well, it was the total accident that my friend Joey built started a trading firm. I mean, if he had
474.40s: started something else or another friend had, I could have gone there. But when I was training
479.36s: as a therapist in this early 70s, everybody was being a therapist. So, and the methodologies that I
487.92s: saw when I was working with as I just dropped the word, an acolyte for some therapist, I looked and
497.36s: said what they're doing is, oh, they're creating, they are recreating the processes that the clients
504.16s: are struggling with and allowing them to live within this process without really looking at the
511.12s: drivers and where they're going. So one of the things that I work with with clients is I'm not
518.88s: afraid to go anywhere. We'll look at their behaviors, we'll look at their beliefs and we'll go down
523.52s: through their deepest identity to those things that they've quarantined that are still driving
529.04s: trading and other behaviors. Got it. That's literally fascinating process to go through. To start
537.20s: us off, have you spent, well, I guess I'll rephrase a question, what's the breakdown of your effort
545.36s: between like a retail trader and an institutional trader? Because I have to imagine that there's
551.12s: similarities and differences between the two. Yeah, what's interesting is that my professional
557.36s: trading clients hedge fund managers and my beginning naive traders, they're still the same
566.00s: human brain. Now, we're expressing our behaviors on a very different level between them,
573.60s: but I'll be damned if it isn't some of the same drivers that are driving both of them.
579.44s: Got it. That makes a lot of sense. So I want to touch on the institutional side first briefly and then
586.24s: kind of spend a little more of the time on the retail side because that's going to definitely apply
590.64s: to most of the people listening to this, at least for my audience. But I always find the juxtaposition
596.16s: between institutions and retail fascinating from multiple levels. So at a high level overview from
602.96s: your depth of experience observing the two groups, what are some of the similarities high level
609.60s: similarities and differences between kind of the kind of services that you provide?
615.12s: Yeah, well, for the professional traders, what we do is we look at what is stopping them from
622.72s: expanding their success. Now, they're very motivated. The money is there. I mean, we can see every day
628.88s: the results of their behaviors. And so they're very interested. Now, they know the markets, they know
635.44s: their strategies. They're very sophisticated or they wouldn't be there. So now we get down to just
641.52s: that really tiny layer of those thin things that are stopping them. And that sometimes comes down
647.84s: to the deeper levels of beliefs and identity. The retail trader on the other hand, who'll be? I'm
653.92s: going to be a trader. I can learn stuff. I'm an engineer, I'm smart or whatever. And I have
661.20s: something called the confidence circle. And it starts with just with a naive confidence. Oh, I can
666.80s: do this. You know, much like I can learn how to be an engineer, write software.
673.52s: And the assumption is that it's a thing out there to learn. But as you well know, and most people
681.68s: fence this, that trading touches our deepest part. And our brains are not set to manage it,
690.32s: because our brains developed on the savannahs of Africa. And with that primitive brain at the
697.60s: base of our neck, we hit just, Brigham takes over sometimes. So I don't know if you've ever
705.28s: experienced it where you wake up the next morning, you say, why did I do that? I know I shouldn't
713.44s: do that. What was that about? Well, in that context, sometimes that primitive brain,
720.48s: old patterns of behaviors and desires take over. So the naive person thinks it's out there.
727.84s: The sophisticated hedge fund managers knows it. There's something here. He's got all the external
733.84s: things managed. So the naive trader beginning trader starts with just a naive confidence. And then
741.12s: the next level of confidence is when I make a profitable trade. Whoopie, look at me. My dreams
747.68s: are going to come true. The mansion, the car, the trophy spouse. I'm going to do it. But then we
756.48s: have three trade losing trades in a row. Oh my gosh, my dream is collapsing. So if they're persistent,
766.00s: then they move to, okay, just making a trade. I need to get a strategy and follow a strategy.
772.56s: So then they experiment back to us through all that creative strategy. And then the strategy starts
778.00s: to work. Yes, I'm now confident in my strategy. Yes, I've got it. But as I teach my clients,
786.88s: all strategies eventually fail. They have to. If strategies, soon everybody would figure out a
794.96s: winning strategy and we'd all be rich. Well, that doesn't happen. The market says, you have confidence
801.28s: in your strategy. Let me show you something. In fact, what I do is I have my clients map their strategy.
812.24s: Heaven. Strategy heaven is where this strategy just works. Create the volume, the movement,
820.00s: the direction, the volatility. Just define the market where it really works. And strategy hell
826.48s: is take the same strategy and define where it just gets the crap being out of it day after day.
834.00s: Well, once you do that, then you say, oh, I need to know what market mood or what market type my
841.68s: strategy really works well in. So then they become an expert in looking at the market and saying,
848.00s: what strategy do I apply? And finally, there's this. It's almost like a sound barrier.
858.08s: That you go, and you get over it. And then you say, I don't need to know anything. I'm fully here
864.64s: with a market. And I will trade from a level of, it's not confidence because that can be run into
874.88s: overconfidence. It's like, I'm just, it's me in the market. And I don't need to know anything.
880.08s: I don't need to protect the market. I am just here with the market making trades. And that final
886.40s: level where you don't need to know you is no ego. There's no need for your PNL to prove anything.
894.40s: Who you are, your value. Excuse me. Then all of a sudden, you get over that hump. Now, that
902.64s: doesn't mean you're not going to have difficult times or losing, but excuse me, I'm going to mute.
913.68s: We're just taking a quick lot of. So then that's the the progress for even the from everywhere
921.92s: from the retail trader to the professional. I love that. And it's really interesting to hear kind of
930.56s: the the experience really I've gone through essentially that. So it's interesting to hear you talk
938.80s: about that that trajectory. One of the things that I'm always fascinated by and one of I guess I
946.64s: would consider like the biggest risks for new traders, especially on the retail side is the
953.60s: Dunning Kruger effect, which you're probably familiar with it. But for those that aren't, it's
958.48s: essentially when you know, we have a little bit of experience, a little bit of depth. We start to
964.48s: feel comfortable and confident. But we still there's still a lot that we don't know we don't know yet.
971.44s: That typically places us directly in front of the train moving fast that is risk. And a lot of
977.28s: times you get run over and I actually use myself as an example for that. The largest losing trade as
983.12s: a percentage of my account, the largest percent drawdown occurred. I was trading for five and a half
988.64s: years, six years at that point. And I was doing well, like relatively speaking, I started really
993.60s: young. I started trading when I was in high school, actually back in 2007. And when I was in college,
999.52s: at that point, I already had a trading plan. I had my trading logs like I was getting very organized.
1005.12s: That's kind of one of the ways I found success. Not because I'm smart. I'm actually probably
1011.20s: about as average as every other human being out there. It's just that I add parameters and I
1016.00s: track things that allows me to make changes that work. So I was kind of confidently deploying.
1023.04s: And then all of a sudden, I get ran over. It's not even like an insane black swan event,
1027.92s: just a larger move than I was expecting. And then boom, there's my largest account drawdown.
1032.72s: I exited the trade flattened because that's what my risk parameter said to do. And as the market
1037.92s: tends to do, it swiftly moved back directly in my profit zone. And I watched a trade, you know,
1044.08s: that was going to be a full profit. And I mean, I never looked back at that saying, oh, I should have
1050.56s: done this should have like, I don't think like that. It's all in the Marine Corps. We call it a
1055.04s: round down range. Like the stuff I set up was specifically and it served me well in general.
1060.48s: It didn't work. This one case. That's okay. But I wanted to specifically ask you about the
1065.44s: Dunning Kruger effect. And if you have an opinion on, you know, the impact on traders. And if so,
1072.16s: what are some of the ways traders can kind of navigate around it? Because I regularly interact
1077.28s: with traders, right? That's why I do this whole thing is to just try to share information very
1080.96s: similar to you. And a lot of traders that are at that, you know, three to six year mark, they're
1087.68s: starting to find success. They don't want to hear that they don't know what they don't know. Right?
1093.60s: You can't tell them that because then defense comes on and then they shut down. But to me,
1098.16s: those are some of the traders that are at the highest risk of kind of these account drawdowns. So
1103.04s: what are your thoughts on navigating that as an individual, but then also as a community?
1108.16s: Well, you really get down to asking the hard questions, Eric. Oh, not easy ones for rich. No.
1117.36s: That's why you're here. You're the expert. So it's the first thing that popped into my mind is
1123.68s: new trader. This is true story. I just hired him. And it was one of those weeks, like four or five days
1133.12s: in a row, where the retail with selling option premium or no, the retail was buying option premium.
1140.24s: And the professionals were selling operation premium and in different strikes all over the floor.
1145.76s: It was kind of a mass thing. Oh my God, you couldn't help but make money. I mean,
1154.16s: buying 25 implied volatility selling 40 volatility. Okay, that works. So when the brand new traders
1165.20s: have been working that way, came to me says, I'm up 10 grand for the day. I'm taking the rest of the day off.
1170.40s: So I took all his money out of the account. I told him I did anyway. He says, you're starting over
1177.20s: because those times are so rare that you just keep going forward. You don't stop.
1185.52s: And conversely to that is when a trader makes money and it fills all their longing, the holes in
1197.44s: their heart, their dreams are going to come true. Oh my gosh, this is it. I finally made it.
1207.84s: When actuality trading, the one of the wonderful things about it is that it's a continual process.
1217.04s: And it's a continually checking in with yourself. In fact, what we have is
1222.40s: a process called our sets, sensations, emotions, thoughts. So before you start trading,
1229.52s: you check in and sensations. We score these on a minus five to plus five. Physical sensations,
1235.84s: if I was drunk out last night and I got a horrible hangover, I've got the flu and I burned the
1243.36s: souls of my feet during fire walking. So physical sensations are a minus five.
1250.96s: Plus five means it's like cocaine. I'm just, my body's just getting my shape,
1260.16s: like shaking down. A zero. I'm fully present with you, Eric. My body's relaxed.
1269.04s: Our emotions, S, S's for sensations, E is for emotions. And it's the same thing. Emotions are
1275.20s: hyper or I'm fully depressed. I can't get out of bed. On our T is our thoughts. My thoughts are
1283.92s: self-critical. My thoughts are neutral or my thoughts are euphoric. I finally got it made.
1291.60s: So every trader then scores himself on these three items before he starts trading in order to
1299.44s: center himself and to know whatever comes I'm here for it. Like when I was on the floor every morning,
1306.32s: I would get up and I would ask my traders, where's the bullet coming from today? And I imagine
1312.24s: a fog bank and a bullet coming right for my forehead. And I would say where's it coming from?
1318.64s: Could there be an interest rate change? You know, interest rates impact options, especially if you
1323.28s: have a lot of, you know, we'd have thousands of conversions and reversals on a short stock
1330.40s: that you couldn't borrow anymore. You know, what's going to happen if there was a huge move in the
1336.88s: market? What would happen if the implied volatility dropped if the live volatility exploded?
1343.84s: You know, what is going to put us out of business? And that's what we would ask every morning.
1348.72s: There's no complacency. The assumption being that we were, you know, we're just a bump on the twig here.
1357.52s: And we are extracting money very carefully with a process of looking at value differentials.
1367.20s: And when you're in that position, well, on the floor of the exchange, I would say about 20%
1373.20s: of the market makers went bust every year. You have a long streak, you're winning.
1380.40s: Boy, am I something? All my dreams are going through. And that's when we really get hurt.
1390.48s: Got it. So for a retail trader who might not have that support structure around them,
1397.68s: they might be the only person sitting behind the screen. And they might not want to look at their
1402.80s: PNL because it's bad. And tomorrow's a new day and we'll figure it out. They're not at the point
1409.44s: where they have like good external controls to help audit these conditions. And they're still at a
1416.16s: point where they still feel confident. They still think they'll be able to figure it out. They'll
1420.48s: figure it out tomorrow. Is there a kind of practice that you've found to be successful
1428.72s: for those specific kind of conditions where it can help a trader maybe apply that set,
1434.08s: that set score? Is that something that you think traders should just integrate early on?
1438.48s: And then this way they don't come into this effect, the Dunning Groover effect, where, you know,
1442.96s: they think that they know everything or they think that they have it all figured out and then
1446.56s: they run into that risk. Oh, there's several layers here. And that awareness, if, you know, every,
1454.24s: like I'll have my new traders settle armed for every 10 minutes, every 10 minutes. What's my
1461.12s: physiology? I lean forward. My jaw is tensed. In fact, the short story, I don't know, I'm missing,
1469.60s: had a rarely have, I do have clients in the same area as I am. They're all over the world.
1475.36s: But the one was in the San Francisco area. So he had a problem. So I went to see him. And he said,
1482.16s: okay, let's, I'm going to do the demo account this morning. So he was looking at, he says, you
1488.64s: notice this pattern here, that's not in my pattern. This is almost there except the volume in this.
1494.00s: And I don't remember all the details, but he said, okay, now it's setting up. Not it didn't,
1499.76s: okay, now it's setting up. And he made two or three trades, two of them were profitable in Sim.
1506.32s: And one of them was a small loss. He says, well, you know, I can do this. So he said, okay, let's go
1512.40s: live. Look what they're doing. They're going to take out, they're going to do this. They're going
1519.68s: to run this market. It was like night and day between Sim and actual trading. So when we're
1528.88s: doing our set scores or sensations, emotions and thoughts, we immediately get an alarm.
1535.60s: And so I had him at this point, you know, exaggerate the physiology of that, exaggerate the
1542.56s: emotions. And it turned out his father was judging him in his mind when he was trading for real.
1550.00s: So once we got that out, then we could have an imaginary conversation with a father and this old
1556.48s: pattern of a critical father from when he was, you know, two and three years old, when he was
1562.00s: live, that survival mechanism kicked in and the tension kicked in. So, you know, one level,
1569.84s: it's awareness of our physiology or emotions and thoughts. Another thing that we do is we have our
1579.36s: market metrics program where you you mark down all the trades, what strategy you were using,
1586.40s: what was your set scores doing them? Was this what we call a lucrative or lousy trade? A lucrative
1592.08s: trade is one where everything lines up, you're following your parameters, you exit, you enter,
1598.40s: you exit, you can stop that, whatever. That is a lucrative trade. Not whether it's profitable,
1604.80s: but it's lucrative. Do enough trades like that. And if you have edge, you're going to have money.
1610.08s: So sometimes I'll have the client figure out how much money will you make with a lucrative trade
1616.16s: on average? Oh, it's $750. Great. This one lost money. You made $750. And that's to avoid the pain
1625.36s: of loss. We reframe that. The other thing we do to help break people out is private coaching, is I will
1634.40s: break with them. They'll share their screen. I'll watch them. And it's amazing. They never screw up.
1644.96s: Why? Because I keep them in their higher level context. I'm continually, if I see the
1651.36s: milling forward and crunch, I'll go, okay, notice your position, notice your physiology,
1657.12s: notice your breathing. Oh, notice your lips. What are your lips doing? Oh, come back to a
1663.52s: context of their highest level self. And we also do group work sometimes. And whereby everyone
1671.20s: brings their market metrics sheets and their colored and coded. So you can see in two seconds exactly
1679.60s: where the problems like. And knowing that you're going to come to the meeting keeps you from
1686.96s: dropping down into that primitive reactive state. I love that. And there's two different follow-ups
1695.60s: I have for you. But I wanted to touch on kind of what I would consider to be the simpler one first.
1700.72s: One of the main pivot points in my trading is when I created, I like to call it a healthy
1710.64s: separation or disassociation with the trading capital that I had. And for quick context,
1716.80s: I started trading in high school because I had a single mom. She struggled with debt. And I knew
1722.56s: I needed to do something. Otherwise, there's just a good chance she's going to have to go bankrupt
1728.08s: or whatever the case is. I was young at the time, but I just saw a lot of risk. Like if the car broke,
1734.00s: we couldn't fix it. I actually learned auto mechanics for those exact circumstances because she
1739.44s: drove to work. And that's all she had. So long story short, when I first started trading,
1745.20s: there was this overwhelming sensation of, this is all my savings. This is everything that I put
1752.00s: together. I can't lose it. And then all of a sudden looking back 16 years, I'm realizing
1757.76s: the harder you squeeze on that money, the harder it is to get it to grow. I'm wondering if you
1764.24s: have an opinion on traders creating kind of a healthy disassociation with their trading capital.
1770.96s: And if so, what does that look like? Oh, you couldn't have asked a better question.
1776.56s: Behind me is the book, a private conversation with money. And when no trader ever has ever,
1783.92s: not one, that hundreds has ever come to me and said, Rich, I'm really concerned about managing
1789.84s: success and being successful. Oh, no, that'll be great. That'll be easy. But we all have our limits.
1796.88s: We have our relationship with money. And what I noticed about 60, 70% of my clients,
1804.48s: they don't appreciate that they have belief systems relationship with money issues, wealth and
1811.20s: meaning, like just this morning, a client was trying to tell me that when he makes it, when he
1817.28s: gets wealthy, then he's going to be able to be a philanthropist because trading is really kind of
1823.76s: icky, evil, you're taking money and you're not really, his parents, immigrants worked,
1830.00s: rejobs in order to put them through school to give them a better life. And somehow trading
1835.12s: easily and just making money, that's, you know, it almost like it was a rebuke to the all the hard
1843.20s: work his parents did. You may have, you know, given that story, you may have a taste of that.
1850.32s: Can you really make money easily? So what we do is we have them step into that wealth. And then
1857.52s: we have a number of exercises. One of them is we look back as wealth and we look at all the people
1863.28s: in our family and our community. And I ask them, okay, who's all there? And they'll list the names,
1868.48s: I'll say, who objects to where you are now? And sometimes it'll be, what? They're all happy,
1874.48s: they're cheering. They're like at a football game standing up and down and cheering. Well then
1880.48s: what is your resistance? Oh my gosh, I had made up that somehow or the other thing is, oh, my dad,
1891.60s: he says the wealthy people are assholes. He says that, you know, once you become wealthy, it changes
1898.00s: you and you're not a good person. So then we have the conversation with the parents. And we look
1904.80s: for all those sticky points because until we can visualize being wealthy, successful trader,
1911.60s: until we can accept it, our survival mechanisms will keep us from going there.
1917.84s: So what are some of the methods people can apply to create that healthy separation with their
1925.20s: trading capital? For me, it was once I had enough money saved up that I knew I could take care
1931.68s: of my mom, that I knew that even if I passively invested in index ETFs, made that average 8 to 12
1938.96s: percent per year, that I was on a good runway. And once I had kind of, I guess what I would call
1945.92s: like my immediate concerns satiated, I was then able to start disassociating with it and saying,
1953.84s: if I lose this, it's okay. I can make more. I have plenty of time and all my immediate needs are met.
1958.32s: And I even went to the degree of like starting to find a balance because you don't want to throw
1964.48s: away money definitely, but I would even include it in my language so that I would help me believe it,
1970.88s: right? By saying it, be like, oh, this is just trading capital. It's no big deal. Oh, I lost $5,
1975.76s: whatever it is, no big deal. Put on another trade. Like I was being very cautious about how I
1980.88s: opened that door for myself and it it worked really well. But I'm sure you have even better techniques
1986.64s: for people to kind of create that disassociation. So I'd love to hear your thoughts.
1991.04s: Yeah, well, I have an exercise called the three-tier exercise where we actually have a conversation
1998.08s: with money. And we look at our relationship to money. And the what's interesting is we have them
2003.44s: become money and talk back to themselves. And that is fascinating sometimes. And there's a third
2009.68s: part where you have a wise person. But what you said is about language. Oh my gosh, that is so
2018.16s: important. Our language, repeated language, creates, reveals the way we're thinking and repeated
2026.48s: language creates repeated thoughts, which then, for example, if a client says, well, I'm going to
2031.60s: try to do that. Oh, time out. Trying means we're setting up an internal struggle. So rather than that,
2039.68s: try try this. Oh, that's funny. Rather than that, invite yourself to step into your new state of
2047.20s: mind and see how that feels. Oh, that feels better. Okay. So we don't have to try. We're just stepping
2052.80s: into something that's better. Is that right? Yes. So the language about money is how your relationship
2061.52s: to it. So if it's like a money for a trader is just like a machine. It's like a tool. It's something
2071.28s: that we use. As long as we associate it, and I think this is what you're pointing out that's so
2076.48s: important with something that we can't lose. It's really valuable. It's going to pay the rent and
2082.72s: all that stuff. Then the pressure on that trade to do it right puts us back down into our survival
2090.32s: mechanism. Yeah. I think that that's really useful to kind of hear. And it's something that I
2098.40s: think all traders really need to consider. And it's one of the things I think I learned a lot of
2103.76s: that stuff from my time in the Marine Corps because you a lot of times are under like really tense
2109.92s: situations. And if you sit there and you think about all of the awful things that could happen,
2115.84s: you become paralyzed. You can't, you know, if you drive your truck, there's a chance you could be
2120.24s: involved in an IED or a complex ambush or all these awful scenarios. And if you sit there and
2126.00s: cycle on those, then you don't want to do anything. You're completely stuck and there's nothing
2130.24s: you could do. So what a lot of us do is we just say, yeah, man, that could happen, but I can't control
2135.36s: that. So let me focus on the stuff I can control. And I think, you know, that's one of the big things
2141.20s: I notice at least from my limited experience with new traders having issues. So that leads me
2146.16s: to my next question, which is when you look at specifically retail traders, what are some of the
2152.96s: common psychological traits that tend to lead to success and then also failure? Yeah. Let me first
2162.00s: comment on your on your combat experience that I've often said, trading is one of the most
2167.76s: challenging things you can do except for combat. And there's just a lot of similarities. In fact,
2174.08s: I went and took some combat training myself using pistols rifles and clearing houses and stuff
2184.08s: like that because the similarities are there. And I felt that creating, well, you know what muscle
2190.56s: memory is having worked with weapons for creating that muscle memory so that those responses become
2198.96s: automated. And in trading, we can do the same thing. We can create that muscle memory.
2205.60s: And I forgot your question. Not that I subtracted. No, it's okay. I can reass the other one, but
2210.96s: there's actually a great follow on there because I think one of the other things that I really consider
2215.76s: especially in those scenarios. And I think it's really cool that you took that kind of training is,
2219.76s: you know, the worst, what I started saying to myself is the worst thing that happens in this
2225.76s: is I lose money. I'm not going to lose a leg. One of my friends didn't get shot. Like none of
2231.04s: this is a big deal. Like scenario is I lose money. But I feel like for kind of civilians that don't
2239.52s: have that that other, you know, benchmark essentially to assess things against, you know, I feel
2246.32s: like it might be difficult for them to losing money to them literally might feel akin to losing
2253.04s: their life or a limb. You know, I think it's absurd, but I could see it happening.
2258.48s: Oh, absolutely. Imagine you have a hole in your heart and you don't feel worthwhile, worthy of
2265.84s: the human being. You, your beliefs about everyone's out to get you. You want recognition. And when you
2274.40s: have a losing trade, it feels like your life is evaporating before your eyes. So you're absolutely
2282.56s: right in the senses. You're going to survive. You're not going to get a leg blown off. But the emotional
2289.52s: feeling going down to that darkest place can be really, really intense. It's interesting. So to
2296.80s: to go back to the other question I had for you, which was what are some of the common traits that you
2302.88s: see specifically towards retail traders. But what are some of the common traits you see for both
2308.88s: psychologically successful traders and things that tend to lead to failure?
2316.40s: I'm going to step into my master traders mindset for a moment. Here we go.
2323.12s: Here I am with you, Eric. Perfect.
2326.00s: I am fully engaged able to be here. There is nothing that you could say or do. I don't have to worry
2335.68s: about what words are going to come next. This is a one to one eyeball to eyeball relationship.
2343.20s: I am fully here. So translating that to the market.
2347.52s: I'm fully here with a market. I am learning. There is nothing that can hurt me. I have my systems.
2357.84s: I don't need to know anything. I don't need to even to trust my strategy.
2363.84s: If something goes wrong, I'll be wow. That's fascinating. I've never seen that before.
2370.64s: So what it is is when I talked about the confidence circle is when you don't need, when you know
2377.60s: that you just give up knowing. One of the most powerful books I've read is The Book of Not Knowing
2382.72s: by Peter Ralston. It's a tough book because you have to really work through it and let go of a lot of
2389.84s: the supports that you need. A lot of us have these knowledge supports or these things we believe
2398.00s: to support us. Boom. What about all those supports? Are you still okay? Now if we can come to the market
2405.76s: or come to combat or I can come with you right now and say, I'm fully here and I'm curious
2415.44s: about what's going to happen. I don't know. I don't need to perform. We're just going to be here
2422.96s: and see what evolves. I love that. Yeah, I love that. So one of the things that I think about and
2434.72s: it's like you're kind of really highlighting it in a fascinating way is I have a saying that I'll
2443.12s: use in the discord and stuff where I'll say like, do you want to be writer? Do you want to make money?
2447.68s: And what I mean by that is I feel like traders go through a cycle where we need to be able, we think
2455.44s: we need to be able to explain what's going on, the relationships between everything and the
2461.44s: longer you are around the market, the more you start to realize how fruitless that is. Sure,
2466.64s: you can have a hypothesis on how something works. No problem. You might just be curious. But
2472.24s: being able to explain everything why everything works, I always found that it's more an ego-driven
2479.92s: event as compared to is it something that I'm actually attempting to make money off of.
2486.24s: I'd like to understand your thoughts on traders being able and it's a big question, but on traders being
2495.12s: able to identify how big of a role ego plays in their trading and how they can kind of self-analyze
2505.76s: their ego as a little bit so that they can understand the impact it has because I think
2511.76s: one of the biggest mistakes I used to make was I would always say, oh, I just have to trade
2516.80s: mechanically. I just have to not deploy any emotions, just stick to the plan. And you know, you kind
2523.28s: of realize obviously you laugh at it and I laugh at it now too because I realize just how ignorant
2528.96s: that is, right? The only way in my opinion to control emotional inputs is to acknowledge that they
2535.44s: exist. So going back to one of the most, at least for me, and based on one of my favorite studies is
2542.00s: the behavior of individual investors. I actually pulled it up. I don't know if you've read it by
2546.24s: Barbara Lee and Odin or just Barbara and Odin, sorry, it's a fascinating trading study and it talks
2552.32s: about things like the disposition effect, the naive reinforcement, things like that, all of this
2558.96s: kind of bundles back into this concept of ego. So to summarize that really long sporadic question
2566.48s: in a neat little thing with a bow tie, you share your thoughts on the impact of ego on trading
2575.52s: and how can traders kind of self-analyze the impact that their ego has on their trading.
2582.32s: Oh my gosh, you've just opened another hour session. So condensed, tie a bow on it.
2590.40s: You know, I mentioned the hole in the heart. One part, another is I need status or I need to prove
2597.44s: I'm right what you said or I need something to show how smart I am or to get my parents approval
2604.32s: or whatever it is. So then there's the ego part that says, I used to have beliefs that I
2614.00s: thought were absolutely true and I won't go into them all. But they were here and then I grew
2622.08s: up a little more than they were different, but they were absolutely true and they're here and
2626.72s: they're absolutely true. And by attaching ourselves to something that's absolutely true,
2631.92s: that is a prop for ourselves. But as mentioned, when we let go of that need for certainty,
2641.84s: then all of a sudden we are curious and open to what is going on in the moment. I have an exercise
2649.52s: called the cocky clanger. And the exercise is cocky clanger. I'll take them back to a trade where
2657.12s: they just knew they had it, they had it made, they canceled their stops because it was going to turn
2661.76s: around. Okay, how do you feel? And we'd go through the physiology, the thoughts in the head, the
2667.52s: emotions. We get them into that point where where their ego was just driving everything.
2674.08s: Then we start to write down what is aware of what you're breathing like, what's your heart rate like,
2678.56s: what's going on your face? What's your jaws? Where are your muscles? What emotions are you having?
2684.00s: What are the thoughts through your head? So we we define the cocky part of them.
2688.80s: Then we create a mechanical alarm. I mean, well, it's an emotional alarm.
2694.56s: And so we go through it and we have the alarm rings and we take them out of that state back to
2700.40s: being an agent of their own lives, move back into the cockiness, the experience, the physiology,
2706.00s: the emotions and everything, ring the bell and then go out. So when it's like Pavlov's dog,
2712.32s: you know, when you when you show the food, they start to celebrate or when they ring the bell,
2717.36s: they start to celebrate. So when they're in a spot, the mental bell rings and they say, oh,
2722.88s: I'm in a cocky ego driven place. Do I want to be here? Does it serve me well? Huh, not so.
2729.84s: And by having them move into it intentionally and creating it and exaggerating it, then moving
2736.80s: out of it intentionally, it gives them the methodology of moving back and forth. And that's
2743.60s: the most important part of the exercise. That's awesome. So it kind of combines the, you know,
2749.92s: the capacity to self identify, but then also to navigate it. That's actually a really,
2755.28s: really interesting approach. We have about 15 minutes left and this is kind of my my favorite time
2762.40s: because now I get to be selfish and ask questions that I'm just curious about. And one of the
2768.48s: the questions that I have for you is I went through a fascinating, I don't know, it was like
2775.84s: a ebb and flow in in terms of expectations. So for a lot of my life, like I said, I kind of shared
2782.40s: some of the details on my upbringing and I grew up not in a great area. I like walk through metal
2788.72s: detectors every day to go to junior high school on like that kind of stuff. And I've always been
2794.16s: good at managing my expectations. I always thought that it was important. It's something that I've
2798.64s: learned from the Stoics. And I think maintaining a healthy maintenance over our expectations helps
2805.76s: increase overall happiness. What I found is I've started to find success that exceeded those managed
2816.40s: expectations. And part of it was by accident because I wasn't necessarily attempting to. And it's
2825.44s: because I had managed those expectations. I didn't think that this was going to happen. So I didn't
2831.68s: really plan for it. And then when it started to happen, I didn't have much of a plan. So my question
2839.20s: is how do you how do you think people, not just traders, but how do you think people should kind
2845.60s: of dance this dance of having good managed expectations so that we can live happy fulfilled lives
2852.64s: against having enough room so that we can grow and strive without having the self limiting
2860.00s: thoughts because of managing those expectations. Eric, Eric, hard questions. But the right hard
2868.56s: questions. So expectations, if you expect really good things to happen to you and they don't
2878.48s: boom, always use all set expectations, boom, you don't get them. And it really hurts and is discouraging.
2886.32s: So what do we do? I kind of think of life as a wave and in trading, we pop our head up every now
2893.44s: and say, Oh, what's our PNL? Or we put our head into our future self. What is that like when I'm
2902.08s: you know, 10 years from now, 20 years from now? And then we go back to process. We do the processes,
2909.12s: we improve the processes, we stick our head up, look around and say, Oh, how's this process working?
2914.96s: And then back down. And we can still have in the mind, step into this future vision of ourselves.
2923.20s: And unless we have a vision of ourselves, and again, I talked about stepping into the traders,
2929.60s: master, mindset and saying who objects. We, by creating this vision of ourselves,
2937.12s: then we can allow ourselves to get there. Our survival mechanism will not let us go to a place
2943.04s: that we haven't conceived of and feels safe. So one, we can have that vision.
2950.24s: And then where we get our thrills is in creating the process.
2955.36s: Stick our head up, look around how we're doing. Okay. Back to process. So I don't know if that's
2963.20s: a complete answer or if it, if it help, if that model helps at all, but it certainly helps me,
2971.04s: you know, process outcome vision. Well, I think the thing that I like about that as I kind of
2978.96s: consider it is it kind of creates an opportunity to rebase line based on where you're currently at.
2984.88s: And I think that's really actually important because when, when I was in high school,
2989.60s: I was just sitting there thinking, I want to have a bunch of money. It's not because I wanted to buy
2993.68s: a bunch of things necessarily, but it's because I wanted the security that money, you know,
2997.12s: provided. I look right now I'm getting the entire side of my house resurfaced because of all the
3002.72s: rain that we've had. And it's a minor inconvenience. I don't want to do it because the noise, but
3009.20s: financially, I genuinely don't care. And that's what I really strive to for a long time is to be kind
3015.60s: of in a place where I was comfortable. But I never knew exactly how to forecast out far enough
3024.00s: because I think without strong enough and high enough aspirations, we kind of put a glass ceiling
3030.32s: on things. So what I really like about that process that you mentioned is, you know, that kind of
3035.76s: poking your head above the wave, observing things, but then coming back down to process, it gives
3041.12s: an opportunity to rebase line on the success that we've had. And then when you look back up to think,
3046.80s: okay, well, this is still managed expectations, but this now raises the bar a little further. And it
3052.64s: kind of enables that growth. I actually really like that. I haven't thought of it that way before.
3057.20s: Yeah. So if you stick your head up and you look back and you go, oh, my goodness, look what's happened.
3065.60s: Oh, that's wonderful. So rather than saying, I said expectations here. I'm waiting. I'm waiting. Oh,
3073.60s: nothing happened. Oh, no. What we're doing is I'm focused on process. And then I can enjoy the
3081.04s: improvement we made because it isn't a goal out there in the sense that, well, you know, that if
3088.80s: you set a goal to make yourself happy, you know, the mansion or the fancy car or the trophy spouse
3095.04s: or whatever, when you get there, oh, my gosh, I need something else. You know, if we're trying to
3101.28s: fill that emptiness that hole in our heart, that meaning in life, and we're trying to do it with
3106.48s: things, then we set those expectations out there. And even if we get them, sometimes they're not
3111.76s: satisfying. So, you know, what you said about the wave process, poke our heads out, outcome, look
3118.64s: back, appreciate our gains and our progress. Oh, my gosh. Does that feel so good?
3126.00s: I love that. Yeah. I really, really love that. And in the last few minutes here, I want to ask a
3132.56s: completely non-trading related question one that I've thought about a lot. And it's family-related.
3139.92s: So I have an older brother, he's four years older than me, love him to death, but we are completely
3146.88s: different human beings. We have things that are very similar about us, but everything from the way
3152.72s: we think about time, we think about our environment, we're just so different. I'm really curious,
3159.68s: I'm sure you have a depth of experience. I've done a lot of reading about this, the difference
3164.00s: between like sibling trajectory and, you know, the circumstance with their brought up and all those
3167.76s: kinds of things, but I'm just fascinated by it. So from a just general personal curiosity question,
3176.40s: why are my brother and I so damn different?
3179.44s: It doesn't matter. You know, the real question is if you love your brother and you say, our
3190.00s: relationship is the most important thing. In fact, I'm working with a group that I started
3196.24s: called Healing the Political Divide. And it is focusing on how do we manage our best relationships
3204.88s: and relationships and business and elsewhere when somebody has a difference philosophic base that
3211.36s: is opposing ours. How do we handle that relationship? And for me, it's, I use the phrase family first.
3222.88s: That's it, family first. So my kids, there's certain things that they have gone off and believed
3230.24s: and are very different than me. And my response is family first. I want the relationship
3237.04s: and that the differences can we use them to create something better. You know, can that diversity
3243.52s: actually improve? In fact, I find that some of the best conversations I had around difficult
3249.36s: problems are the ones where we're very different. And sometimes out of this, oh, come something beautiful.
3257.92s: Yeah, definitely. I guess from my perspective and to be clear, we actually have a great relationship.
3264.72s: We have a lot of similarities. I guess I was, I'm more just genuinely curious, is it just a function
3272.56s: of different human beings grow different ways? And even though he's my brother, we grew differently.
3278.96s: But like, we don't have conflict. Like, we have a great relationship and stuff. I'm just so fascinated
3284.32s: by the, like, he went to the same schools I did. You don't even mean like we had a very similar
3288.40s: upbringing, but yeah, just very different. Oh, my gosh. You know, neonatal environment,
3297.52s: just brains the way they operate. His, he may have started an earlier belief of X and you started
3305.52s: an early beef of Y and Y kind of worked for you and you grew it. He had an early beef X. So he
3312.08s: sees everything through X. And as a result, he's grown that direction. Who the heck knows?
3318.40s: But if you love your brother and you have a great time, so what? Enjoy the relationship.
3324.64s: Yeah. And that actually was really informative right there because that was my underlying assumption
3328.88s: is that at some points, people kind of pick up different, you know, paradigms that they do the
3334.72s: world. And then that just kind of shapes the way that the rest of things go. Oh, my gosh. You know,
3339.68s: how we filter? Oh, oh, it's, it's like once you start a certain filter, then that filter engages
3348.80s: other people who have the same filter, who then expands that filter. And that's all you see.
3354.08s: And as a result, I think that's part of the political divide issue is that our filters are
3359.68s: self reinforcing the groups we belong to are self reinforcing. And all those things, once you start
3366.08s: even a little bit in a certain direction, it can blossom. And you guys can be very different.
3372.48s: Yeah. God, I love that. So the last thing I want to end us with here is if there was like one
3378.48s: tool or technique that you think every single retail trader should deploy, what is it?
3385.04s: That would be the golden keys. First is awareness. You know, doing your set scores,
3391.44s: checking in, setting the alarm. And some engineering clients I have have no clue as to what's going
3399.28s: on inside them. They're all in the heads. But so physical awareness or emotions and the quality
3406.96s: of our thoughts are being critical or whatever our thoughts like. So the golden keys is awareness.
3413.92s: And the second part is acceptance. If I say, damn it, I'm judging myself again. Stop it, Richard.
3424.00s: Not very helpful. But if I say, oh, that's fascinating. I have judgmental thoughts. In fact,
3430.00s: many, many years ago, I took out a jar and got $51 bills from the bank. And every time I had a
3436.88s: judgmental thought, I put a dollar in the jar. The $50 did last today.
3445.68s: So acceptance. Oh, that's interesting. I just had a judgmental thought. So it's awareness
3451.52s: acceptance. And then it is agency. Now, what do I want to do? I'm aware of it. I accept my,
3460.48s: one of the things you said earlier that was really important is not stifling the emotions, but
3464.96s: being aware of them. And I'll expand on that, letting them come and letting them go. So awareness,
3470.80s: acceptance, and then agency. Now, what do I want? And with awareness and acceptance, you can then
3476.56s: start to build the awareness part can actually develop agency from your higher self and make decisions
3483.52s: that serve you better. I love that. That's awesome. And thank you for leaving us with that. So I know
3489.36s: that you have your book, which I'll throw a link to that in the video description below for people.
3494.96s: But how else can people find you? Where can people learn more about you?
3499.76s: Yeah, conversations.money. And if you go to conversations.money slash Eric and that's E-R-I-K with a K,
3508.24s: what I'm going to do is I'll give them a coupon for a free online course around money. And this is
3513.92s: the stuff that I've learned from years of trading and training traders. So although it's not
3518.72s: trader oriented, we go through all the processes about our relationship with money and how we screw it
3525.44s: up. And for traders, this is so important because it's all about money. That's it.
3531.76s: That's awesome. Well, Richard, honestly, thank you so much for hanging out with me, Sharon.
3536.80s: Just a small snippet of your experience. Obviously, there's a lot of depth there. And I definitely
3541.04s: look forward to chatting with you again in the future. I find this. Indeed. These conversations
3546.16s: are always curious to me because I consider myself a just tremendously ignorant person. So getting
3552.40s: an opportunity to like pick some of this stuff up is, I mean, it's just massive. It's super fun.
3557.60s: Okay. I'm going to give you a chance to rephrase that. I am a continual learner that just loves
3563.84s: meeting people and learning. That too, but I'm also an idiot. So.
3568.40s: Well, I can see that you need a little private coaching and we're going to set it up.
3578.32s: Thank you so much. I'm going to invite you into a much more positive space.
3583.44s: Thank you. I appreciate your time. Take care. Take care. I think this was great.
