0.12s: leveraged ETFs can literally supercharge
3.08s: your returns but it's not without risk
6.16s: you're going to see higher overall
7.88s: volatility of the portfolio so the goal
10.20s: of this video is to walk you through how
12.44s: we can trade something like my favorite
14.92s: strategy the coverage strangle in
17.16s: something like a leverage gtf such as
19.20s: tle q's and how we can build a system
21.52s: around it to strike a balance between
24.00s: our return potential but then also
26.12s: managing our risk side of the equation
28.52s: so let's get right in
30.64s: this is what we're going to run through
32.40s: we're going to go end to end I'm going
34.96s: to walk you through some highlevel
36.96s: Concepts and then we are going to get
38.92s: into some details on how to think about
41.40s: inform this kind of thing for yourself
43.40s: so let's get right to it very first
44.84s: thing is the coverage strangle for those
46.60s: who are unfamiliar I'll throw a link in
48.28s: the notes below but it's a bullish trade
51.04s: we're going to be long shares sell cash
52.96s: secured puts and have ratio short calls
55.52s: against the long shares we'll have more
57.00s: details on that in a little bit but
59.04s: that's the overview for the strategy now
61.48s: the whole idea of a leveraged
63.40s: application is to amplify your returns
66.72s: through additional beta what does that
69.20s: mean let me show you if we pop over to
71.36s: the platform and we take a look at QQQ
73.32s: on the le- hand side here this is a
75.40s: 5-year weekly chart I want you to notice
77.60s: the move that happens here it goes from
80.64s: 402 is down to
83.72s: 261 is this is from 2022 into 2023 this
88.32s: is actually during the bare Market
89.92s: Market that we had that year if you look
91.36s: at QQQ compared to tle Q's tle Q's went
94.80s: from 91 down to 17 notice the difference
99.12s: Q's is about a 36% drop tle Q's is an 80
104.64s: plus% drop so if you have
107.04s: $100,000 through here at the end of it
109.36s: you have 20 that's difficult for people
111.64s: to manage and most people bail on this
114.16s: during the worst possible time which is
116.84s: as it's in this freef fall so we're
118.36s: going to talk about how we can manage
121.00s: this additional beta so that we can
123.60s: actually take advantage of the leverage
125.92s: without taking on excessive portfolio
128.76s: volatility so what does that mean for
130.44s: Best Practices well we're going to have
131.56s: to pay attention to notional sizing
133.20s: because something like T Q's is three
135.36s: times leveraged the daily returns of QQQ
138.88s: so it's essentially behaving is three
140.72s: times the number of shares on a intraday
142.88s: basis now volatility Decay refers to how
147.00s: leveraged ETFs behave to summarize this
150.00s: at a high level it essentially means
152.24s: volatility is going to be exacerbated
154.84s: during prolonged consecutive down
157.24s: periods because of the sequence of
159.56s: returns so if we take a look at this
161.60s: quick example here you can see I'm
163.92s: showing you a perspective return
165.92s: sequence for QQQ versus tle q's and tle
169.52s: qq's were calling it three times the
171.84s: daily return of QQQ this doesn't take
174.40s: into account the fact that there is a
175.80s: discrepancy between these it's not going
177.24s: to be perfectly matched sometimes it
179.00s: will be slightly more sometimes it will
180.44s: be slightly less but just for the
182.16s: example of volatility Decay I'm using 1:
185.40s: one so for QQQ if we have a 1% day a -2%
189.68s: day followed by a 5% day followed by a
192.52s: -2% day that's what this math is showing
195.00s: us this is day 1 Day 2 Day three day
196.76s: four so the required move to get back to
199.56s: break even here is
201.84s: 8.52% if we have this sequence of
204.92s: returns if we do the same in tle Q's
207.60s: three times levered the required move
209.36s: becomes
210.80s: 29.27% what does this mean this is
213.52s: volatility Decay because now if Q's
216.68s: shows that
218.12s: 8.52% move Q's is now back to break even
221.48s: but tple Q's is not because that only
225.04s: translates to a 25.5 6% move in tle Q's
229.88s: so then we still have another several
232.68s: per to go to get back to break even and
235.12s: for a quick visual of this this is
237.08s: exactly why if we compare this period
239.48s: from from Q's to tple Q's take a look
242.24s: Q's already passed and started making
244.96s: highs off of this period in here tple
248.00s: Q's still hasn't gotten back to highs
250.96s: this is volatility Decay it's because of
252.92s: this period here so what that tells us
254.80s: is we have to be very very thoughtful
256.48s: about avoiding that volatility Decay
259.04s: otherwise it can be a problem for us so
260.72s: now let's talk about the strategy I
262.12s: already have a series that I'm building
264.56s: around this I have two videos that I've
265.96s: done outlining this kind of pretty far
267.92s: in depth so I'll link to those below and
270.44s: I'm also going to start reviewing this
271.76s: on the Monday night YouTube live session
273.56s: so you can check in for updates on it
275.60s: there I'm using real money it's for an
277.68s: example so let's take a look at how to
280.44s: build a strategy around this we use the
283.24s: outlier strategy process so we're going
286.36s: to analyze the profit mechanism the
288.12s: mechanism indicators we're going to find
289.76s: structures that fit and we're going to
291.12s: build a strategy in this case we're
292.92s: coming into this problem set knowing the
295.16s: structure that we want to use we want to
296.72s: use a coverage strangle why do we want
298.16s: to use a coverage strangle for bunch of
300.00s: different reasons but in this case this
302.04s: is designed to be a little bit more of a
304.28s: hands off approach to trading leverage
307.96s: so this is something that I might run in
310.84s: an IRA account that I'm not necessarily
313.20s: trading a ton or a 401k account or if I
316.76s: was on active duty in the Marine Corp
318.20s: and I was going to be deployed for a
319.48s: while something like that so this is not
322.16s: designed to purely optimize best
325.04s: possible return and risk profile we have
327.44s: the added injunct of wanting to be a
330.92s: little more hands-off less babysitting
333.16s: so what does this look like well the
334.88s: profit mechanism here is pretty simple
336.84s: it's going to be capital gains via Trend
339.24s: drift and beta this is essentially how
343.48s: we're going to use something like tle
345.76s: Q's to outperform buy and hold in QQQ so
350.04s: the profit mechanism traits and
352.84s: indicators are pretty simple we know as
355.24s: traits that we're looking at something
356.56s: that's very volatile it's three times
358.24s: the daily leverage which is is really
359.96s: important to track and it's going to
361.60s: have excessive beta compared to Again
364.56s: The non- Leverage counterpart so it's
366.60s: going to move around a lot and it's
368.28s: going to have options that have good
370.32s: volatility in them which is why the
371.92s: coverage strangle is a great fit for
373.28s: this for signals in terms of determining
376.32s: if we want to get in if we want to get
377.92s: out if we want to scale up if we want to
379.76s: scale down we can use things like moving
381.72s: averages standard deviation channels RSI
383.96s: kind of my standard technical analysis
386.32s: tool Suite which I'll link to a video in
388.88s: below that goes through that in detail
390.44s: but most of this is going to be stuff
391.88s: that I'm going to look at to make
393.60s: adjustments relatively infrequently this
395.48s: isn't going to be something I'm day
396.64s: trading so our signals have to match the
399.56s: overall time frame the strategy as we
401.68s: already discussed is going to be a
402.76s: coverage strangle other things that
404.44s: could fit into this our ratio called
406.20s: diagonals Buy and Hold Buy and Hold with
409.04s: different kind of um exit protocols
411.76s: instead of just holding through things
413.44s: that kind of stuff so what does the
415.24s: strategy itself look like in this case
417.84s: well we're going to make sure that we're
419.04s: long at least 100 shares to preserve
421.68s: upside potential and to allow us to sell
423.68s: calls against the Longs at a ratio and
426.20s: again if you're unfamiliar with what
427.48s: that is check out that video below we're
429.12s: going to sell cash SEC Cur puts both of
431.08s: these are going to be within the 50 DTE
432.68s: window to maximize Theta Decay but we're
434.88s: not doing super short term so that we're
436.60s: having to adjust it all the time we're
438.72s: going to focus on rolling to maximize
442.24s: profit over basis adjustments so we have
444.52s: to pay attention to when we choose to
446.72s: roll because we want to make as much
448.32s: money as we can in the SC scenario
450.08s: versus worrying about updating our basis
452.48s: risk is going to be managed primarily
454.40s: via size I already showed you and I will
457.32s: show you additional draw downs but in a
460.04s: recent example we had a 82% draw down I
462.92s: don't want to do that so we're going to
464.16s: have to find different ways to navigate
466.72s: around that draw down so that we're not
468.52s: experiencing that moving averages to set
471.52s: entrance and exit triggers completely
473.60s: viable we'll talk about some different
475.08s: variations of that it can help a lot
476.96s: otherwise you can use sizing is another
480.32s: method to decrease your overall risk and
482.40s: then for me I'm going to use a 5% move
485.12s: as my scale window so if something moves
487.28s: down 5% I'm going to decide scale in
489.44s: scale out stay the same but I'm going to
491.00s: use that as a trigger to modulate how
492.96s: much money I'm using when because one of
494.96s: the most important things during this
497.48s: kind of down move is to have enough
499.52s: money to scale into the trade as it's
502.24s: plummeting so that you can improve your
504.08s: basis so that you can hit your recovery
507.04s: Point much much sooner because if we
508.92s: take the examp example of top ticking it
510.72s: you bought it here for example at 90 you
512.52s: take the crash down here to 16 you're
514.36s: still not back to break even but if you
515.96s: were just 35% invested here and then
518.88s: every 5% draw down you added a little
521.60s: bit up until it you added three times in
524.44s: the course of 2 weeks then you stretch
526.44s: that out to maybe adding on 10% draw
528.76s: Downs until you're fully invested
530.20s: towards the bottom here you already hit
532.20s: break even and you're making money again
534.12s: the scaling element of this is going to
535.64s: be very very important so quick overview
538.56s: this is from Port folio visualizer this
540.52s: is just showing the difference between
542.52s: tle q's and q's for total returns
545.12s: annualized standard deviation which is
547.00s: really important and then also draw
549.04s: Downs again this is not fully correct
551.64s: because I'm showing you on the chart
553.00s: there what it actually looks like but
554.24s: it's pretty close so this is showing you
555.92s: that if you buy and hold T Qs you can
558.08s: have some really great years however
559.64s: you're going to have potentially really
561.88s: bad times these are real bad times bro
564.88s: so now let's talk about how this overall
567.76s: system performs so what I did is I just
570.48s: ran through Python and I plotted a
573.12s: couple different moving averages a 22
575.00s: period a 50 period 150 period and then I
577.48s: looked originally at Buy and Hold
580.28s: performance in tle Q's versus Q's from
582.84s: 2010 comparing the maximum draw Downs
585.04s: which we already knew this this is just
586.36s: a visual representation of it so what my
589.40s: mind is thinking maybe we can use moving
591.72s: averages to cut this and if we take a
594.56s: look at something like this where the
596.72s: number of Touches for 22 versus 50
599.76s: versus 150 you can see that the shorter
602.24s: term the moving average is the more
604.68s: frequently it's going to be interacted
606.72s: with some of these other numbers down
608.12s: here are not accurate you can ignore
609.64s: those this is literally just for the
611.04s: touches so at a quick eyeball of just
614.08s: using a very basic straight entry exit
617.32s: criteria you can see that we can
619.16s: manipulate a tle q strategy to very much
622.24s: outperform q's and we can also decrease
625.28s: the maximum draw down if we're really
627.60s: thoughtful about these levels which
629.08s: again this is not this is just a dumb
631.12s: system so there's a viable approach here
634.96s: if we can manage these draw Downs so now
637.60s: the name of the game is seeing how do we
640.28s: participate in these
641.92s: 3,270 gains over these time frames
644.72s: without giving up too much upside profit
647.48s: potential by getting out using different
649.44s: moving averages without going through
651.44s: these 82% style draw Downs so one of the
654.08s: first things you'll notice is that the
655.44s: 50-day moving average works really
658.28s: really well so if we use a threeyear
660.36s: daily chart you can see that if you use
662.92s: a 50-day moving average it would get you
665.04s: out much much much sooner in the
667.92s: lifespan of the trade so that you don't
670.64s: have to go through this really drawn out
673.12s: nasty draw down so for example here
675.64s: using three-year daily chart you can see
678.00s: that let's say you got in here it would
679.88s: keep you in you might get out somewhere
681.48s: in here get back here get out again here
683.48s: at a small profit you take it all the
685.16s: way to the downside come back up get
686.96s: back in here get kicked out again here
688.92s: for small loss then you're not back in
691.08s: so you can see that there's still quite
692.48s: a few interactions with the 50-day
694.16s: moving average so there's a couple
695.72s: choices we can use we can either use a
697.72s: 200 day moving average which is going to
699.48s: be much slower you're going to have a
700.72s: bigger draw down before it kicks you out
702.36s: but in this case let's say you top
703.76s: ticked it again at 91 this might kick
705.72s: you out instead at 68 so it's not a
708.16s: great move but it's not going from 91
710.36s: down to 16 and if you use a 200 day
712.52s: moving average you get in here bad
714.68s: timing top ticked it gets you out here
716.52s: at 68 and then you don't get back in
718.48s: until down here you get chopped up a
720.24s: little bit then you get chopped up again
721.68s: a little bit here but then you're
723.04s: essentially Off to the Races into here
725.08s: the downside is that this move would
727.48s: have got you in full from 85 down to 59
731.00s: so what we can Tinker with is using a
733.40s: combination of these different moving
735.44s: average strategies so that we can
737.44s: maintain some sensitivity and strike a
739.36s: balance but this is the introduction to
741.60s: using covered strangle in a leveraged
743.68s: ETF if you're interested in following
745.68s: along check out those Monday Night
747.48s: YouTube live streams and then the other
749.24s: thing is if you're interested in another
750.60s: follow on video that talks about the
752.76s: specific relationships with these moving
754.40s: averages that I'm going to use let me
755.88s: know and I can share with you what I'm
757.32s: going to do and why I'm going to do it
758.72s: as always if you have any questions let
760.16s: me know be an outlier I'll see you later
