0.00s: What's up everybody, Eric here, back with you in
2.68s: and we have a bunch of stuff to talk about.
5.84s: It's been a few weeks since we've talked last,
9.68s: so I'm interested to learn a few things from you.
13.08s: The first thing is you just wrapped up a course.
15.80s: We've talked about that a little bit
17.00s: before we started recording, but how'd it go?
21.16s: Well, obviously it's not really up to me to say how it went,
23.48s: but the feedback we've got from the participants is really good.
26.52s: People really liked it.
28.68s: The Slack community's growing.
30.16s: It's pretty active.
32.36s: People are now sort of this cross-pollination of ideas.
35.12s: People are working on stuff and we've managed to keep it to
40.52s: very sort of evidence-based, very much like,
44.08s: I don't want to hear your fucking opinion on Tesla,
46.16s: whether it's going up or the Elon Musk is genius.
49.16s: I want you to like, on Thursday, Tesla calls are underpriced.
53.20s: Right, find the data, go and tell me is that true,
55.56s: that kind of thing.
56.56s: So it's working well in that regard.
59.12s: It was heavily oversubscribed.
61.04s: We'll probably do it again, maybe August.
65.84s: We limited it this time a little bit
67.80s: because we didn't know whether we could keep up
69.88s: with the questions and it kind of depends on,
73.96s: you got to get a workflow going, but that went pretty well.
77.04s: So I think if we did it again,
78.28s: we'd probably just have an open enrollment thing.
80.44s: So that's awesome.
81.92s: Yeah, I'm glad to hear one of the things I remember
84.24s: when we were first talking about it
85.88s: and I had a chance to look over some of the materials
87.68s: is like, I think you do such a good job balancing
91.52s: the higher theoretical slash math heavy aspects
96.52s: with the practical application.
98.40s: Because I think that's like one of the biggest
100.28s: niches, quote unquote, that's kind of missing
102.88s: when you talk about options is things tend to be either
105.44s: super theoretical or just some dude
107.88s: that doesn't really understand put-call parity,
109.92s: but it's just slinging options.
111.76s: And it doesn't seem like a lot of educated middle ground.
115.68s: How did you guys go about finding that balance
118.64s: between including enough theory,
120.20s: but not overwhelming theory,
121.76s: but including enough practical application,
123.76s: but not just focusing only on that?
126.96s: Yeah, I think in general,
128.52s: that's where you've got to be as a trader, right?
130.72s: I mean, there's options in our
134.08s: irreducibly mathematically complex
136.20s: and there's no point pretending none not.
138.96s: So on one hand, you've got the, you know,
141.96s: the the Chad who thinks it is edge everywhere
144.80s: and all you've got to do is fire out thousands of orders
146.80s: and he is going to make so much money
148.08s: and he's worrying about what kind of Ferrari
150.64s: he's going to get at the end of the year, you know,
152.88s: and that's, although I also, you know,
155.84s: but and then you've got the professor at the other end
159.00s: who's like only sees the math
160.96s: and he thinks there's an edge in the math
162.96s: and neither of these people's right,
164.96s: there's no edge in math,
166.60s: there's no edge in knowing about options,
168.92s: but if you don't know about options
170.48s: and you're trading them, you're going to blow up.
173.64s: Absolutely, like they are complicated
177.84s: and they will get away from you very quickly.
181.08s: So there is definitely stuff you need to know,
184.40s: but there's a lot of other stuff
186.12s: that you get taught in college courses
187.72s: that you don't need to know at all.
190.16s: Like you don't need to know stochastic calculus
192.68s: and I don't think you ever needed to, you know,
195.52s: no one, none of the research is using that now anyway
198.84s: because all the stuff that could be solved,
200.16s: that way's being solved.
201.84s: So I think you've got a lot of math professors teaching
204.24s: the course, you know, basically from 25 years ago
208.04s: and that's no real use to anyone.
211.16s: So that's what James and I are trying to do
212.88s: is find that middle ground.
214.68s: And I think that's what I tried to do in my books as well.
218.08s: Obviously the books are written at a more,
222.80s: probably at a more mathematically high level,
225.28s: but they're not mathematics books.
227.36s: And I never, I was never setting out
230.24s: to impress people with mathematics.
231.84s: That's not the point.
233.16s: But you should be able to read them
234.52s: and just read through the equation
236.44s: and just trust me on what's going on there if you need to
239.52s: because it's the phenomena that's the important thing.
243.72s: And this is one of the reasons I wanted to do it with James
245.76s: is because he's very much on the same pages me with that.
249.04s: He's got much more of a Delta one background than I do
253.88s: and the honest trading Delta one is much more of a,
259.88s: it's more heavy on the trading side
261.52s: because it's less heavy on the theory side.
263.68s: So that's normally the way it works
265.08s: as things get theoretically more complicated,
267.16s: they trade in a more and more simple manner.
269.20s: One of the other things that I was actually
272.56s: rereading through positional options trading,
275.36s: actually working through those differential equations
277.60s: the way that you are.
278.44s: So I'm curious if it's to help people understand
281.16s: the way that options are behaving in a real world
284.64s: or is it to give the theoretical background to them?
289.68s: I mean, it could be either,
291.44s: but the way my brain works normally with these things
295.52s: is say, I've got a problem.
297.16s: I want to figure out, I don't know,
300.16s: some sizing problem like if you're doing a certain trade,
303.20s: what's the best way to size it, right?
305.48s: So once you've got that idea,
307.68s: that you have to then convert it into a mathematical model
311.12s: so you can work through the implications of that model.
316.04s: So that's sort of the way I would do it
317.72s: with say the option pricing stuff as well,
320.16s: like the directional option pricing stuff,
322.92s: you're like, well, okay,
324.40s: what does it mean that there's a return in the underlying?
327.00s: Where does that flow through to the equations?
329.44s: You work through that and you see
330.76s: where it ends up the other end.
332.60s: So it's like you start with your assumption
334.20s: and you work through the mathematics
335.56s: to see where it takes you.
337.32s: So does that make sense?
338.68s: It does, yeah, absolutely.
340.12s: It's basically the way a physicist would approach the world.
343.24s: It's like you make an observation
345.20s: then you try and model that observation
347.04s: and see what the model leads you to.
350.16s: Hopefully it's something new.
352.56s: You want to get something new out of the model
354.48s: that wasn't just in the observation you made.
357.08s: Got it.
358.24s: Yeah, and I think that that's one of the cool things
361.08s: about when I was reading a lot of your work,
362.56s: even your older work is that it got me to think
366.60s: a lot more along those lines.
368.64s: People that took your course,
371.00s: what did you give them specific next steps on like,
374.40s: okay, this is what we showed you guys.
376.64s: This is what we think you should be focusing on next.
380.08s: How do you see their progression?
382.56s: I mean, to be honest, we call the course
386.40s: quant for retail.
388.32s: Because the idea was we were going to get a whole bunch
389.96s: of sort of retail traders or people who weren't options traders,
394.24s: like we had RIAs and money managers
396.24s: and so forth, we were going to teach them
398.92s: quantitative methods that worked.
401.32s: What it turned out to be more though
403.60s: is retail trading for costs.
406.32s: Because a lot of the people we had,
408.16s: a lot of people had very heavy math backgrounds,
411.00s: like we had math professors,
412.32s: we had engineers, computer scientists.
415.68s: Their problem is much more
418.80s: that are on the academic side of things
420.52s: and they want certainty before they do a trade.
424.00s: So we thought we were going to be taking the,
427.92s: no offense, but the YouTube was
430.16s: and telling them slow down, do some work first,
432.88s: make sure you understand it, then do a trade.
435.76s: Whereas what we ended up telling these people is like,
438.56s: just don't be a pussy, do a damn trade.
441.00s: Put something on it, yeah.
442.24s: You're going to learn a lot more when you've got a trade on
445.68s: than you are by thinking about it
447.40s: before you put the trade on.
449.40s: And a lot of these people,
451.36s: they would say something like
454.72s: sell options on Friday night.
458.04s: And I'd be like, what's the best time to sell them?
460.08s: I'm like, I don't know, Friday night.
461.76s: And they're like,
462.76s: well, five minutes before the close
463.92s: or 10 minutes before the close.
465.20s: And I'm like, literally, I don't know.
466.52s: If I want to go early, I'll do it 10 minutes
468.48s: before the close.
469.64s: If I'm sitting at my desk, I'll do it right on the close.
471.84s: It doesn't matter.
473.44s: And it's like, that's not the important thing.
475.60s: Two or three minutes here and there, it doesn't matter.
478.12s: And I'm like, well, could we find an optimal
480.12s: and I'm like, look, look, you're going about this the wrong way.
483.44s: You're going to waste time looking for an optimum,
487.16s: an optimal solution to something that doesn't exist.
490.32s: You'll find something, but it's meaningless.
492.88s: The only thing we know is we've got this broad effect.
496.56s: And the best you can do is throw shit at this broad effect
500.04s: and hope over time it wins.
503.36s: All these other little minuscule things
505.96s: really aren't the problem.
508.32s: So you'll learn a lot more.
509.68s: You can always make things better.
511.88s: But you've got to start doing the basic stuff
514.92s: before you really know what it is you have to improve.
517.56s: Because before you do a trade, honestly,
520.04s: you don't know what the weaknesses of your process are.
525.12s: Is it your execution?
527.00s: Is it your transaction costs?
529.00s: Is it the fact you're doing it on the wrong index?
532.64s: I don't know.
534.16s: You have to do the trade to figure that out.
537.60s: So that was really where we were bullying these guys to do.
540.92s: And they'll be like, have you tested this effect?
545.24s: Like we're giving them an effect, right?
546.44s: Very standard one.
547.84s: Bonds go up in the last week before the end of the month.
553.08s: Absolutely they do.
554.72s: So we're like, go and buy some futures, buy some TLT.
557.56s: And they're like, can I tell you some putts, brains?
559.84s: I'm like, look, you can do whatever you like.
561.72s: But why?
563.48s: Why are you doing this when the simplest thing?
567.12s: We've told you it goes up.
568.72s: What's the simplest way to make money from that?
571.32s: Buy it.
572.48s: OK, don't dick around and make it more complicated.
576.12s: The idea is to make things simpler, not more complicated.
580.04s: So you always want to trade the simplest, cheapest instrument.
585.40s: And that's never options.
587.84s: So if you need to trade options and trade options,
590.80s: but if you don't, that's great.
593.52s: That's a good thing.
594.44s: It's not a bad thing.
596.72s: So that's what we're hammering it.
598.40s: We're still hammering it about that.
601.24s: I like that.
602.88s: It reminds me of a saying that I tell a lot of people,
605.72s: perfection is the enemy of progress, right?
608.32s: Like the idea is do something that you think is relatively
612.24s: well thought out and then optimize it over time.
614.72s: But yeah, if you try to find that perfection,
617.24s: but it also seems to really affect
619.04s: like you're talking about that crowd of people,
620.68s: the people that are really smart, super analytical,
623.20s: that they get stuck in this loop that they can't
626.08s: escape from.
626.76s: So speaking specifically to that audience,
630.52s: it's, tell me.
633.28s: See, I was briefly an academic.
635.72s: And when you say perfections,
638.48s: the enemy of like progress,
640.44s: in the academic world, you can't be perfect.
645.68s: But if you don't try to be, you won't be good enough.
648.92s: It's such a, the best analogy is like professional sports.
653.48s: It's such a competitive place
657.36s: that you have to do everything to be as good as you can.
660.64s: So that's the game that these people are coming from.
663.72s: And it's just that they're trying to apply that game
666.96s: into a situation where it really doesn't fit.
669.84s: So what they're doing is understandable.
672.68s: And I was like that as well.
674.04s: Like I definitely, that was my problem.
676.56s: I had to overcome.
678.00s: It's like I, I would wait for a trade to be perfect.
683.36s: And by the time, as a market maker,
685.04s: by the time the perfect trade turned up,
686.96s: 50 other people already done it.
689.16s: Because they're prepared to do it when it's pretty good.
692.44s: Not perfect.
693.68s: So I know the thing that's struggling with.
697.72s: And it's very common for people to be like,
700.36s: these academics, they'll never be good traders, blah, blah, blah.
703.76s: But the YouTube chatter probably won't be either.
706.96s: Everyone's got a separate group of problems
709.84s: they've got to get through.
710.96s: It's hard for everyone.
712.68s: So whether you're starting at this end or at this end,
715.48s: it's going to be difficult.
717.40s: But in order to be good, you've all got to end up
719.44s: in the same place.
721.20s: You know, just throwing trades out there isn't well done.
725.52s: You're not under trading, but you've got other problems.
729.40s: Right.
729.88s: Yeah, and that makes total sense.
731.24s: I think the thing that I'm kind of referring to
734.20s: is when before somebody is willing to try something,
737.56s: they want it to be perfect.
738.88s: Or they want to have a well-formed essentially
742.96s: as good as they can possibly get it structure.
745.84s: And I think that they're, again, to your point
747.80s: that there's value in that.
749.04s: But I've always seen that same force, though,
752.84s: where the people that kind of trade long-term,
755.60s: they find this balance of both.
757.48s: And I definitely think that it's awesome
760.12s: that you guys talk so much about it.
761.48s: And I also think it's really cool that you continue
764.44s: to remind people.
765.32s: It's actually reentered my conversation cycle
769.12s: of trading the simplest product.
772.12s: Because one of the things that you'll,
774.52s: I'm sure you've heard, right?
775.52s: People are options traders or futures traders.
779.04s: And sometimes they might be, but it seems like
781.96s: from the retail perspective that might be limiting.
784.16s: So for that audience, though, that spends so much time
788.32s: trading, you know, specific products,
791.32s: what would you say to get them to be more open
794.36s: to trading a simpler product, i.e., maybe they think
798.12s: something's going to go up to go to Delta 1 versus buying
802.56s: out of the money calls or buying in the money calls
804.64s: that are far out in time.
805.72s: Like how would you get them to think about
808.04s: those two different value propositions?
811.72s: Well, I think part of the reason that people end up
814.04s: in the options world is a very sensible one.
816.44s: It's because volatility is more predictable in direction.
820.48s: But most of the time, you can't predict the direction
825.08s: of a stock.
825.76s: You just can't, right?
827.04s: Especially on the daily level, like it's the most
829.76s: difficult problem in the world.
831.44s: Like everyone's trying to do it.
834.20s: It's not going to happen.
835.68s: 99% of the time.
837.36s: So you go into the options world for a very good reason.
840.20s: But then you get really hyper focused on that.
842.88s: And you find a situation where that isn't, it doesn't apply.
846.84s: And your mind is just stuck in this other world.
851.68s: So I think the thing to do is just to be,
853.80s: and this applies to all trades all the time,
855.72s: be very clear on what your age actually is.
859.48s: Like, ask yourself, like, what am I trying to do in this trade?
864.28s: What is the phenomenon I'm trying to monetize?
867.12s: So it's, yeah, bonds go up.
869.28s: OK, what's the simplest way to do that?
872.12s: It's not to buy a call spread.
873.68s: It's not to buy a one-year leap.
875.76s: But it's not, it's to buy bonds.
878.40s: And I think you have to, a lot of this
883.00s: is just about being very, very clear about what your actual
886.60s: age in any case is.
889.00s: You know, so often, yeah, I don't, yeah, that's it.
895.52s: That's the answer.
896.92s: Period.
897.44s: Yeah, but I think that it's a great way to frame it,
901.00s: to get traders to simply ask themselves, what's the edge?
904.64s: And then finding the clearest way to express it.
906.48s: Because one of the things that I picked up from one of your books,
909.44s: and I think it's a great way to frame it,
911.28s: is as soon as you start trading options,
914.16s: you're introducing a lot of other forces
916.56s: that might not even be part of your hypothesis.
919.08s: IE bonds go up.
920.76s: OK, well, as soon as you're buying options,
922.88s: now you're introducing volatility,
924.48s: time to get, like, all these other things.
926.44s: So I think it's a really great way to think about it.
928.72s: And speaking about volatility, one of the members
932.88s: from my community was asking about, well,
936.48s: first they were asking about volatility regimes,
938.32s: but then we bracketed down really what they were asking about
941.00s: is volatility surface regimes.
944.32s: And they're curious how you determine what kind of regime
950.28s: that we're in at a given point in time.
951.92s: Like, how do you essentially analyze a volatility surface
957.20s: regime?
958.56s: I don't really know what they mean by regime.
963.68s: Yeah.
964.68s: You mean, if it's in terms of parameterizing the slope
970.68s: or the term structure, I mean, there are ways of doing that,
977.68s: but I'm not really sure.
979.52s: The thing that I think most people get a little bit wrong
986.52s: is that the volatility surface 95% of the time just
991.64s: is kind of constant.
993.60s: I mean, the level of vol changes, and the term structure
996.60s: does flip up and down, right?
998.56s: But the actual shape of the curve doesn't change nearly
1002.80s: as much as people kind of hope it does.
1006.48s: So I'm not really clear on exactly what they want.
1010.84s: Yeah.
1011.20s: So what they were referring to was Colin Bennett's book,
1015.60s: Trading Volatility, there's a section in there
1018.16s: that talks about idealized volatility regimes.
1021.12s: So things like sticky delta, sticky strikes, sticky local
1024.24s: vol and jumpy vol, essentially.
1026.68s: But it's talking about them in relation to the vol surface.
1031.80s: The thing about all of those things
1033.68s: is they're all idealized states that the world
1038.16s: is never sticky strike.
1039.44s: It's never sticky, whatever, sticky.
1043.52s: What is the other one, sticky strike?
1045.24s: That's what I can't remember what they are,
1047.40s: kind of tells you something, right?
1049.32s: The world is never exactly one of those things.
1051.72s: The world is always doing all of those things.
1054.84s: And I think it's more of a, I don't know,
1059.80s: an educational conceptual tool than actually one
1062.84s: that you'd really hang your hat on too much.
1067.52s: I mean, I really don't think about that stuff at all.
1071.04s: So yeah.
1073.80s: I think it makes sense to you how important it really is.
1078.80s: Right. Yeah, no, and that makes total sense to me.
1081.16s: I think there could be opportunities to trade it potentially.
1085.04s: But when they first brought up vol regimes,
1086.96s: I immediately interpreted it as is volatility
1091.20s: in aggregate, high, low, or transient.
1093.80s: That's what I originally thought.
1095.52s: And then they kind of sent me the clip
1096.92s: and I realized that they were actually talking about
1098.36s: vol surface regimes.
1099.52s: And I just similar kind of, because the following one
1103.44s: question to that, which is what I'm genuinely curious about
1106.20s: is how would you trade that?
1109.20s: Okay, so if some of these vol regimes,
1116.24s: if the market is really behaving like that,
1119.04s: some of them are arbitrajable.
1121.40s: Right.
1122.24s: And I can't remember one of my books talks about it a bit.
1125.60s: The problem is they're never perfectly in that regime.
1129.96s: So it's not like an ab, and that you're buying something
1134.12s: and immediately selling something else.
1135.72s: It's kind of like an arbitrage process.
1137.88s: So it'd be like if you find something
1139.28s: that moves in a sine wave.
1141.00s: I mean, that's arbitrajable because you sell it there
1142.96s: and you buy it there.
1143.68s: And you can, so it's dynamically arbitrajable.
1147.88s: Sure.
1148.72s: But you can do it.
1151.16s: And so when I said I don't use it,
1154.96s: I definitely shade my delts as their way.
1158.00s: So I don't use black, shoulder, delta for hedging anything.
1162.60s: I use a total delta, which also includes the effect
1167.36s: of volatility change as the underlying changes.
1171.60s: So you use a total derivative instead of a partial derivative.
1176.68s: So you do have to make some assumptions there
1178.64s: about how volatility is moving.
1182.36s: So I do use it a little bit,
1183.68s: but basically I'm just using an empirical model.
1187.24s: I'm saying volatility is doing this.
1189.12s: So the amount of volatility does this as the market moves.
1194.16s: And it's typically neither sticky,
1196.16s: vol, nor sticky strike.
1197.40s: It's somewhere in the middle of those two.
1202.60s: Yeah, you do use,
1205.60s: I use basically an empirical version of it,
1208.12s: which essentially is just looking at how that relationship
1210.68s: has moved over the last, well,
1213.68s: I think I tend to use like three to six months.
1218.20s: Yeah, because I actually remember reading that book
1221.44s: a while ago, and when I took a look at it,
1223.92s: I started tracking it a little bit.
1226.28s: And I noticed that most of the time it was like that sticky
1228.88s: local vol and the other three scenarios were far less common,
1234.48s: at least based on what I was observing.
1235.88s: But it's interesting that you bring up like that total delta
1239.08s: concept. Can you explain that a bit more?
1242.52s: Okay, so this might be difficult to do without like a white board
1246.88s: or something.
1248.92s: Blacksholes delta is the derivative of the option price
1253.48s: with respect to the underlying,
1255.68s: assuming nothing else is changing.
1257.64s: So it's a partial derivative.
1259.92s: In reality, things other things are changing.
1263.44s: In particular, the volatility is changing.
1267.20s: So as well as devol, as well as the option DS,
1272.36s: you have to have the option devol times devol DS.
1276.96s: So you need to basically know your Vega
1280.44s: times how much the volatility of that option
1283.28s: is changing as the spots changing.
1285.52s: I see.
1286.36s: So it's like if you've got puts and you go down,
1289.92s: you can expect the volatility of that put to go up.
1294.24s: Right.
1295.08s: But again, depending on what vol regime you're in,
1298.04s: if the curve slides like that, it's going to do one thing.
1301.40s: If the curve doesn't slide and the put's going to move,
1303.68s: it's going to do another thing.
1305.72s: Emmanuel Durman wrote a paper on this a long time ago.
1310.84s: But yeah, like every market maker will use a total delta
1314.60s: like that because if you don't,
1316.56s: you really are going to be mis- hedged.
1320.64s: But it also matters more to market makers
1325.76s: because they want to stay on the market.
1328.12s: Their delta hedge is really going to immunize them
1332.56s: from what the market is doing.
1334.80s: So it's really important that they're matching
1336.72s: what the market's actually doing.
1339.00s: So they're not going to just use one of these simple regime
1341.68s: models.
1342.20s: They're going to be using an empirical model as well.
1345.48s: Otherwise, it's not going to match.
1348.52s: Then for like a typical retail trader,
1351.60s: what do you see the efficacy of a total delta
1354.40s: tracking for them as worthwhile, not worthwhile?
1360.56s: I think it's probably not even worth dealing with.
1364.64s: It's one of those things that to do it
1367.36s: is going to be a lot of work.
1369.44s: Like you'd have to come up with your actual empirical model
1372.48s: of how does the vol of this particular strike move
1376.00s: as the underlying moves?
1378.00s: And it's going to be different for all the strikes.
1379.64s: Like the amount of money is the most important one.
1381.88s: But you'll also have changes in the wings and changes
1384.40s: in the risk reversals.
1385.56s: And it's a lot of work to track all that stuff.
1390.40s: And then I'm not sure how you're going to make any money out
1392.80s: of it because I wouldn't recommend most retail traders
1397.80s: do delta hedging anyway.
1399.92s: So whether you think something, if you just bring up
1403.24s: your ID screen and it says this is the 25 delta put
1407.72s: and your model says no, it's actually on a 28 delta.
1412.60s: I mean, who gives a shit?
1414.04s: It's like for you in order, as a retail trader,
1417.96s: there's no difference practically between 25 and 28.
1421.36s: It's like it's going to be lost.
1424.36s: And you think you've made a difference,
1428.48s: but really once you take into account all the uncertainty
1431.48s: and the modeling to get to that 28 over 25,
1435.08s: I mean, who knows?
1435.92s: You could just be completely wrong.
1438.04s: So I can't see it being useful to retail at all.
1442.60s: I mean, most crop, like longer term,
1445.44s: prop guys wouldn't bother using it either.
1447.24s: It's really a market-making tool.
1450.04s: You can see right on the market all the time.
1453.76s: And that's actually the only context I've heard it in as well.
1456.68s: So that's why I was curious if there was a use kit.
1461.08s: I don't use it at all.
1462.64s: So yeah, I think it's a market-making thing.
1467.00s: Fair.
1468.08s: One of the other questions that I got that's actually,
1470.48s: it's a really fun dialogue because there's a lot of papers
1473.08s: and a lot of research out there on it.
1474.76s: And it is holding leveraged ETFs
1479.00s: to essentially just increase buying hold returns, right?
1482.32s: So the idea is instead of holding spy or IWM and the queues,
1487.36s: you're holding the leveraged counterpart.
1489.56s: And there's pretty like, interestingly, two camps.
1492.64s: There's the one camp that says,
1494.84s: oh no, drag is so bad that you can't make any money.
1499.12s: And then the other camp is saying,
1500.92s: fuck you guys, it's good enough.
1503.60s: I'm curious if it's something that you've studied
1506.04s: and if so, what do you think about retail traders
1508.92s: holding leveraged ETFs to enhance returns?
1514.24s: Almost always not a good idea.
1519.00s: There's a lot going on.
1520.20s: It's not as simple as saying there's volatility drag.
1522.40s: They always decay.
1523.76s: They don't always decay.
1525.68s: It's a very complicated process.
1527.40s: For something very simple mathematically,
1530.12s: it is a very complicated process,
1531.88s: particularly because we don't know what the actual process
1534.20s: of the stock itself is.
1536.28s: So we know how leveraging it changes that process,
1541.40s: but we don't really know what it was in the first place,
1544.92s: see what I mean?
1545.92s: So it's like you can say certain things
1547.44s: if you assume it's a Brownian motion
1549.52s: and then you leverage it, but it's not.
1552.04s: So it's a very complicated process.
1553.84s: So it's never as simple as saying they always go to zero.
1558.32s: They do decay.
1561.40s: The mean return will tend to be below zero, like I said.
1564.96s: It doesn't have to be, and there are plenty of times
1567.36s: when it isn't.
1569.04s: Like some of these things have massively outperformed
1572.32s: their reference product.
1575.44s: Can't think of one off the top of my head,
1576.72s: but I'm sure they have.
1580.32s: It's basically a situation where as with any trade,
1586.48s: there's an optimal size for the trade.
1590.32s: So basically that comes back to the Kelly criterion.
1593.20s: This is the optimal growth size.
1595.52s: And if you leverage more than that,
1597.80s: you're going to end up taking more risk
1599.52s: and getting lower returns.
1601.12s: And that's the side that most of these leverage ETFs are on.
1605.88s: It's basically you've got the optimal Kelly size,
1608.60s: which might be like 1.2 times leverage,
1611.88s: and you've leveraged it to three times.
1614.32s: So you're at the point where you're actually
1616.32s: getting diminished returns because of that leverage effect.
1619.88s: So if you want a really simple rule of thumb,
1624.12s: take all of your long stock positions
1628.16s: in your long-term stock holdings
1630.80s: and replace them all by going short,
1633.40s: the leveraged ETFs.
1636.32s: So what's the leveraged cues?
1640.44s: Does it SQQQ or something?
1642.20s: That's one of them.
1643.04s: And then there's T triple cues, yeah,
1644.36s: because there's different layers of leverage, right?
1647.16s: You can have a 2X3X.
1648.60s: That's the typical breakdown.
1650.56s: Yeah, and it's not again, okay.
1654.32s: So normally the higher leverage ones will decay more,
1657.96s: but there is a more volatile.
1660.20s: But the bigger problem you have to really look at
1662.32s: is your borrowing costs,
1663.52s: which a lot of people don't look at.
1665.44s: So like right now, there's, well, there's VXX, right?
1671.64s: Then there's UVIXI and there's UVIXI.
1675.12s: UVIXI is one and a half leveraged.
1678.32s: UVIXI is two leveraged.
1680.04s: So you might think that the two leveraged ones
1682.24s: are better short than one and a half,
1684.28s: but the two leveraged one right now
1685.92s: has got a 22% borrow rate.
1688.40s: Whereas the one and a half has got a 3% borrow rate.
1692.28s: And if you look at the expected decay
1694.12s: and put that in, turns out that the one and a half
1697.16s: in this case is a better sale in terms of risk reward.
1701.92s: Of course, it's UVIXI, which is now trading at like 2.7
1705.68s: or something because that determined for it
1708.24s: to become completely irrelevant, I think.
1712.28s: I don't know what the issue is doing there.
1714.16s: I think they've just given up on it.
1716.60s: Like they should have split it when it went to 20
1719.24s: and they should split it to get to like 200.
1721.68s: It's a never, we know what's gonna happen.
1724.36s: Or letting it go down to these levels,
1726.20s: just you can't trade it.
1728.28s: The transaction costs are just way too big.
1732.16s: In like, what would the calculus be to just let it go
1734.76s: as it's just becoming like too much of a burden
1736.44s: or they're not making enough money on issuing,
1739.12s: continuing to issue it?
1740.04s: Like what's, to me, it seems like you've gone through
1742.24s: all of the work to set it up.
1743.44s: Why not maintain it until the wheels fall off?
1745.84s: I have no idea what they're doing.
1748.28s: Don't know, could be, could be a lot of things.
1752.92s: Okay.
1753.76s: But it's, it's got to the point where it's basically
1757.48s: in a relevant product.
1759.12s: You know, if you've got a bit asked spread of a cent
1761.76s: and you're paying a ticket charge per share,
1764.96s: why am I gonna trade something that's 2.7 instead
1767.88s: of trading VXX like 35 or something?
1770.72s: Yeah, it's just pointless.
1773.32s: Got it.
1774.56s: Another thing that is becoming more and more invoked lately
1778.84s: that I find curious is the retail trader obsession
1783.44s: with algos.
1786.80s: And for retail traders, obviously, it's this brand new novel
1791.04s: concept.
1792.36s: And to me, it seems like there's just a tremendous amount
1797.20s: of focus on it.
1798.72s: And I think retail traders grossly misunderstand how it
1802.52s: might fit into their world and also just how long it's been
1805.64s: around otherwise.
1807.88s: Specifically for retail traders, how do you view AI
1812.88s: more importantly, algos for this question,
1815.88s: fitting into their portfolios or trading portfolios?
1821.04s: You mean them using it as a way of generating alpha?
1825.36s: Right.
1826.36s: Let me do it.
1829.44s: It's very unlikely that someone who's not a specialist
1834.72s: is going to get some AI algo that can beat the market.
1839.52s: It's, I'm not saying no one can.
1843.40s: But if you look at the firms that are really going into this,
1847.44s: they've got people with PhDs and machine learning.
1850.96s: You're not going to do a course online or even an undergrad
1856.64s: course and figure out enough to beat the market.
1859.52s: You're not as good as these guys.
1861.40s: It's one of those games where you're just not
1864.88s: going to win straight up against these guys.
1867.08s: So you have to do something else.
1869.64s: I kind of think, I mean, I use ChatGPT all the time.
1873.96s: But basically, it's like an intern.
1878.00s: It's like instead of me trying to do something,
1880.76s: and one of the hard things about having an intern is you
1883.64s: got to explain very carefully what you need done.
1886.52s: And that's the same as the GPT app, right?
1888.88s: It's like you've got to be very clear about,
1891.44s: I want you to do this and then this and then this.
1894.92s: And under those constraints, it's fantastic.
1898.52s: I can write hundreds of lines of code,
1900.20s: and it will do it pretty well.
1901.36s: It will do it a lot faster than me.
1902.88s: And it's a really great tool.
1905.32s: But in terms of using it to predict volatility or whatever,
1911.04s: I'm not even going to.
1912.80s: That's just one of those problems that,
1914.80s: even if I can do it, there's better uses of my time.
1919.68s: It's, I think, we have to be very clear that every time you do
1926.56s: a trade, you're making a forecast.
1929.72s: Like, there's some people had this idea,
1931.20s: I don't forecast.
1932.20s: Well, yes, you do.
1932.88s: You just bought something.
1933.84s: So you're obviously thinking it's going to go up.
1936.64s: Otherwise, you wouldn't have bought it.
1937.84s: So the action of doing a trades and implicit forecast.
1941.36s: But I think this idea of like trying to out forecast the market
1945.60s: like that, it's just a very difficult problem.
1950.04s: And I think people are being somewhat seduced
1952.00s: by this idea of alpha.
1954.00s: They've got to get alpha.
1955.36s: You don't have to get alpha.
1956.32s: You've got to get money.
1957.92s: You know, beta counts as money too.
1961.20s: It's much more likely that you're going to benefit
1963.92s: by finding risk premier that are always there.
1967.72s: And you are going to essentially get paid for taking that risk.
1970.84s: It's a much more likely outcome
1973.24s: than you genuinely finding alpha by out forecasting the market.
1980.76s: Could you, yeah, sure.
1982.04s: And if you really feel like, if you want to do it as a puzzle,
1987.24s: instead of like, I don't know, Sedoku or something,
1989.84s: yeah, knock yourself out.
1990.96s: But it's just not, it's not a very good way
1993.80s: to run this if you're thinking of it as a business
1996.16s: and really trying to make money.
1998.56s: It's not the right way to do it.
2001.12s: It's like with sports gambling, right?
2002.60s: Everyone goes into sports gambling thinking,
2005.24s: I'm going to predict who's going to win this game.
2008.32s: And that's not what the pros do at all.
2011.44s: Like the pros are basically saying,
2013.80s: the spreads this, the totals that,
2016.72s: therefore what should the equivalent spread
2018.68s: in the first quarter be?
2020.44s: And they're just looking at all these relative value trades.
2022.76s: Like they practically never try and predict
2026.16s: who's going to win an NBA game
2028.00s: because that market is so efficient.
2031.08s: It's the same with the markets.
2033.08s: Right.
2034.28s: So you kind of alluded to another topic
2038.20s: that I wanted to ask you about, which is chat GPT
2041.08s: and kind of retail traders using AI to just enhance their process.
2046.92s: So from a retail trading perspective,
2049.52s: what are some of the things that you think
2052.56s: retail traders could or should do
2055.64s: with something like chat GPT or AI in their trading process?
2061.76s: I would caution them against using it at all.
2064.68s: I think most people use the computer too much.
2067.72s: It's this idea that you should automate all the stuff
2071.00s: you need to automate.
2072.04s: And people are like, well, jump trading do it.
2074.08s: So it must be the thing to do.
2076.20s: Jump trading kind of have to do it
2077.68s: because of the way they trade.
2079.48s: Like if you're doing HFT,
2081.28s: you need to automate everything.
2082.88s: If you're doing a million trades a day,
2086.16s: you can't do that by sitting in front of a computer.
2089.16s: But I think for your average retail person,
2092.80s: you don't want to speed things up.
2094.32s: You want to slow things down.
2096.24s: You want to actually be more engaged
2099.64s: because you want to learn.
2101.24s: And the way you learn is by reviewing every step in the process.
2104.80s: So it should be like, look at an options trade, right?
2106.88s: It's a complicated thing.
2108.80s: You have to make a forecast of what volatility is going to be.
2112.04s: You have to choose your strike.
2113.88s: You have to choose your expiration.
2115.36s: You have to choose your re- hedging frequency.
2118.44s: How did each of those impact your trade?
2121.28s: At the end of the trade, you go back and you're like,
2123.88s: well, my forecast was slightly optimistic.
2126.80s: So I shouldn't have made quite as much money
2128.64s: as I thought I would.
2129.96s: But then this happened, and this happened, and this happened.
2132.72s: And you actually have to think through the whole process.
2136.24s: And you might find that you're actually really good
2138.44s: at forecasting volatility, but you're hedging too sloppy
2142.76s: so you're getting too much luck involved,
2145.28s: and that's masking the results.
2147.24s: And if you don't go through that process,
2148.96s: you won't find that out.
2150.60s: And you're not going to find that out
2151.88s: by automating everything.
2153.68s: You know, people ask, you know,
2155.44s: what's the software that you should use?
2157.76s: Like maybe Excel, maybe a Word document,
2161.56s: but maybe a piece of paper and a pen.
2164.04s: You don't want to be doing this fast.
2165.32s: You want to be doing it as slow as you can.
2167.76s: And people, so there's this thing everyone kind of knows
2172.64s: that you should keep records, right?
2175.36s: And people have the wrong idea
2178.24s: of what that process is for.
2180.64s: It's not about so you can go back
2182.40s: and do statistical analysis on all your results
2184.96s: from three years ago or whatever.
2186.76s: I mean, I keep records of everything I do every day,
2190.20s: but I have no idea where they are.
2192.20s: Like I couldn't tell you where my files from three years
2194.76s: are going to are, because that's not what they're for.
2197.76s: What the four is for the process of making them,
2201.32s: because it makes you sit down and think about each thing.
2204.96s: And the slower you go through it, the more you're going to learn.
2207.24s: It's about active learning.
2209.04s: It's not about statistics.
2211.40s: So even if you just do it on a legal pad
2214.68s: and then throw it away, that'll be fine.
2217.60s: It's not the keeping of them.
2219.16s: That's important.
2220.00s: It's the making of them.
2222.60s: I actually love that.
2224.88s: And it's probably one of the most common things
2226.84s: I tried to talk to people about is literally the process.
2232.64s: One of the things I do find chat GPT useful for,
2236.36s: and I'm curious what your thoughts are on this.
2239.96s: Specifically, if there's a concept,
2244.16s: let's say they're reading your book
2246.20s: and they come across a part that they're just,
2248.96s: they're struggling with.
2250.56s: What do you think about using something like chat GPT
2253.16s: to help them understand that concept or look it up?
2256.56s: One of my favorite things to do with chat GPT
2259.52s: is essentially the 80, 20% rule, whatever you want to call it.
2263.32s: I think it's Bernoulli principle or whatever.
2265.76s: But essentially, the parade always at it.
2270.12s: Yeah, thank you.
2271.16s: The parade will principle where essentially you get a synthesized list
2275.04s: of the highest impact information.
2277.28s: Do you think that accelerates the process too much
2279.36s: and they're not respecting the process in that manner?
2281.32s: Do you view that as an accelerator?
2283.44s: No, that can be useful.
2285.16s: I use it for, so one of the things I did,
2289.32s: and this was basically I did it because a student was like,
2292.68s: trying to convince me it was a useful thing.
2294.92s: And so I did this as a little test,
2296.52s: but it's a useful way to, it was a good project.
2300.00s: I'm very big on using Monte Carlo simulations.
2302.92s: And I typically, I used to have a really great little Excel
2307.32s: and then I got free with some book a long time ago,
2310.52s: but it doesn't work on the latest versions of Excel.
2313.36s: So I'd had to get a bunch of stuff.
2316.00s: And then basically I told Jack,
2318.92s: Jack GPT to write me one.
2320.96s: And I gave it like two instructions.
2323.80s: And it pretty much wrote the whole thing,
2326.24s: exactly as I wanted to,
2327.52s: and thought the results, and it took me like 10 minutes.
2332.28s: And it's like 150 lines of code.
2334.92s: And if I'd done that,
2336.24s: they would have taken me the best part of a week
2337.96s: because I'm not very good at Python.
2341.00s: So using it for that is fantastic.
2343.44s: And I use it for the intraday volatility measurement stuff
2347.60s: that I do, because I measure volatility
2349.76s: at like all different frequencies.
2351.48s: And then I aggregate it.
2352.68s: And I can just do that by,
2355.80s: I had it write all this code in Python.
2357.60s: And now I can just hit run in a Jupyter Notebook
2361.12s: and then off it goes, it's great.
2362.88s: So if you go to stuff like that, it's fantastic.
2365.88s: But in terms of actually,
2368.36s: think of it as an intern.
2370.88s: Interns are useful, right?
2372.52s: But would you have one, but would you have one come up
2376.64s: with your alpha?
2378.72s: Would you get some guy that is just,
2380.88s: he's finishing his third year of college
2382.76s: and he's looking for a job in the summer.
2385.08s: And you're like, how should I trade this option?
2387.40s: I mean, you wouldn't do that, right?
2389.76s: But that grays it like,
2391.80s: hey, write me a Monte Carlo simulation.
2394.20s: And off they go.
2395.32s: It's like that, it's great.
2396.56s: It's a fantastic tool.
2399.00s: And I think that's all it is.
2402.48s: It's a fantastic tool.
2403.56s: But it's not for, it's not going to tell you
2405.20s: how to beat the market because it doesn't know.
2407.44s: Sure.
2408.68s: Yeah, because the other thing I think
2410.48s: that's good about integrating stuff like AI
2413.60s: into the process is I also think it
2415.80s: starts to introduce people to AI.
2419.00s: Because I don't think it's going anywhere.
2420.28s: I think it's going to continue to grow in prevalence,
2422.80s: going forward and not just trading,
2424.80s: just literally in different assets of life.
2427.28s: So I feel like in general, it's a good way
2431.48s: to get familiar with a tool that either you can kind of evolve
2435.52s: with and learn alongside of it.
2438.76s: Or you could just kind of not pay attention to it.
2442.08s: And then you get left behind.
2443.52s: But I think that I do think that AI has a place
2450.04s: in accelerating learning curves.
2451.96s: But to your point, I think especially
2454.52s: for new concepts going through that process
2457.12s: is really important for folks.
2459.80s: What do you see the future of, and this is the last question,
2463.88s: by the way, I don't want to keep you too long.
2465.72s: But what do you see the future of AI in the markets in general?
2477.56s: I could have visited just a situation where AI takes away
2483.04s: most of the market liquidity providing stuff.
2486.56s: Like we've seen in the crypto world these AMMs,
2491.80s: these liquidity providing pools and uniswap and stuff.
2495.32s: And obviously they've got problems, right?
2497.12s: But that isn't even AI.
2498.44s: That's just the simplest possible algorithm.
2502.52s: Even going back to the early 2000s,
2507.92s: I was developing a market-making system,
2510.68s: kind of an automated market-making system,
2512.84s: which was based on a very simple application
2515.16s: of what a market-maker would do.
2517.00s: And it basically encoded that.
2519.44s: That was using technology that's 25 years old now.
2523.12s: And I think AI is going to be able to do that way better
2527.36s: than a human market-maker will.
2529.16s: It'll be able to manage, it will see all the flows,
2532.60s: and be able to react to all of them absolutely optimally,
2536.44s: not just semi-optimally, like a human does.
2540.72s: And a human basically is quoting a spread,
2543.88s: not just to collect the spread,
2546.84s: but to immunize themselves against the fact
2548.72s: they're not doing everything perfectly.
2550.64s: So AI won't need it anywhere near as big a spread.
2553.84s: And it will be better.
2555.80s: And I think a lot of those kind of jobs,
2559.40s: like especially on the Delta one side, for sanitation desks,
2564.16s: you know, market-making in vanilla,
2566.16s: all that kind of stuff,
2567.28s: I could see that completely being automated.
2570.16s: The things that it won't be as good at,
2575.16s: the things that don't have a set process,
2578.76s: you know, the things where you might have a customer
2581.68s: calling you up and saying,
2583.84s: I kind of want to do this, but I'm not sure what do you think.
2588.68s: You know, it's like this is an old joke
2590.36s: that a computer can beat a grandmaster at chess,
2595.08s: but they can't put the pieces back into the box.
2598.76s: So computers are really good at doing hard stuff,
2601.60s: but they're not actually all that good at doing
2603.96s: ill-defined, easy stuff that people are good at.
2607.40s: So I think that are the jobs that are going to stay around.
2611.60s: But I also kind of think there's a decent chance
2614.00s: that AI just takes a look at us
2615.44s: and decides we're not worth a hassle.
2618.96s: I mean, there's never been,
2622.12s: this isn't my observation.
2623.48s: This is the chief AI guy from Google who resigned
2628.08s: while back.
2629.36s: He said that there's never been a situation in the world
2633.00s: where a less intelligent group ruled over a more intelligent group.
2639.68s: I mean, you can make some joke about politicians here,
2642.24s: but I think at the species level,
2643.76s: that's absolutely true.
2645.52s: Right.
2646.36s: We're not being ruled by the pecs here.
2650.28s: So I could definitely see that happening.
2654.12s: I don't think all of the stuff around AI is alarmist.
2658.28s: I think there are problems that it could come up with.
2663.08s: So we'll see how that goes.
2665.28s: Yeah, the other question I have specifically related to AI,
2668.40s: how do you think the inclusion
2671.24s: and I had a similar hypothesis
2673.48s: where a lot of the market making liquidity provided roles
2678.20s: likely could get phased out?
2680.36s: How do you think that that would impact
2682.28s: the long-standing market function slash forces
2686.00s: that we see like the variance risk premium in indices
2689.12s: or just put call skew, things like that?
2691.72s: Do you think it would have any impact
2693.32s: or would the overall disposition of human beings
2696.28s: on the back end still wanting that protection,
2699.08s: still willing to overpay, allow it to persist?
2702.52s: Yeah, I think that's the sort of thing
2704.80s: that is driven by people's desire to avoid risk.
2710.32s: And it may become tighter.
2712.56s: That's the computer might,
2715.24s: it's like I'm always selling vault, right?
2719.24s: And I also have a certain degree of risk aversion
2723.68s: that would mean that I might not be doing it
2725.52s: as aggressively as I should be.
2727.68s: And a computer's not gonna have that.
2729.96s: But on the other hand, the computer,
2731.24s: it's not the computer's money, right?
2733.20s: It's someone's money and they're going to have these issues too.
2737.08s: So I think things like that will always be around.
2742.48s: I think it's purely the matching of buyers
2745.12s: and sellers that could change.
2746.56s: And to be honest, that's happened already.
2748.68s: You know, like 30 years ago,
2751.12s: if you were an options market maker,
2753.40s: you might make markets on three stocks.
2756.60s: But now, I mean, when I left,
2758.84s: it was an options market maker would make markets on a hundred.
2762.48s: Now it's like five or 600.
2764.28s: So the automation of that process is already well underway.
2768.72s: So now instead of having one human do five or 600,
2771.88s: why don't you just have a computer do the whole lot?
2774.84s: I mean, it's not revolutionary.
2776.92s: It's just continuing along that process.
2780.44s: Right, I'm kind of scaling interesting.
2784.84s: Okay, the very last question,
2786.12s: because I always lie to you on the last question
2788.28s: and then there's always one more.
2790.00s: And then I'll let you go for real.
2792.48s: But have you studied the volatility
2795.40s: around the debt ceiling conversations?
2799.44s: Yeah, kind of.
2802.72s: We don't really have enough data to say anything.
2807.72s: And each one has been against a fairly different backdrop.
2812.80s: So I can't really find anything that I particularly believe.
2818.68s: And if you look at this time,
2820.72s: volatility really didn't do anything.
2823.64s: The market really didn't do anything.
2825.48s: The market had sort of got to the point where
2828.72s: it's like watching a horror movie, right?
2830.88s: Look, we know how this is going to play out.
2833.56s: You know, you don't want to be the good looking blonde girl.
2836.24s: We know what's going to happen to her.
2838.04s: And why is she going into the basement all alone?
2840.16s: But we know the whole thing, right?
2842.28s: It's like that.
2843.12s: It's like we kind of knew how it was going to end.
2845.08s: We didn't know the exact steps, but really,
2848.88s: it's very straightforward, right?
2850.24s: Both sides want to basically blame the other side.
2854.64s: Whatever happens, the president's the one
2856.68s: who gets blamed the most.
2858.72s: And that's pretty much that was like that under Obama
2862.64s: and Trump and Biden, same old, same old.
2866.64s: So this one, the market really didn't care.
2871.44s: And there were a lot of people like,
2872.68s: oh, the VIX is way too low because of this debt ceiling, right?
2877.56s: Which is a classic example.
2879.00s: Oh, really, it's too low.
2880.08s: Well, the market's not moving.
2882.04s: And do you think you're the only one who knows
2883.96s: that this issue's out there?
2885.68s: I mean, you're going to have to have a better reason
2887.44s: for that for why the VIX is too low.
2890.08s: So turns out the VIX wasn't too low.
2893.00s: If anything, it was too high, right?
2895.00s: The part that I find interesting is like,
2899.44s: we know with relative certainty, the likely outcome,
2903.92s: but we don't know with pure certainty.
2906.84s: And if big if there wasn't, there was no agreement
2912.64s: for whatever reason and there was a default.
2914.68s: Like, obviously the risk there is just massive.
2918.16s: So that's the part I find so curious about the event
2920.92s: is that it's a very high probabilistic,
2923.44s: determinable outcome, but the risk on the other side
2927.60s: in that small percentage of cases
2930.32s: that it could not happen would be pretty big.
2932.44s: So it's curious how just longer term,
2934.76s: I started looking at it myself,
2935.92s: but obviously I'm like a fucking caveman
2937.60s: with this stuff compared to what you can do.
2939.08s: That's why I was asking you.
2940.52s: I don't think this is, even if there was a default, right?
2946.60s: Would you be huge?
2948.64s: I don't think it would be nearly as big a deal
2950.48s: as if it happened in say the 50s.
2954.20s: America is not the world's overwhelming economic power
2957.64s: to the way it was back then.
2960.24s: And also to be honest, these idiots have been messing around
2964.16s: with this stuff for so long
2966.16s: that this whole idea of America being absolutely risk-free
2969.96s: funds, no one believes that anymore.
2972.68s: I wouldn't be surprised if there's another credit downgrade
2976.04s: because if you keep acting like an idiot with the credit,
2980.24s: eventually people aren't gonna be surprised
2982.44s: when something bad happens.
2983.96s: And it's not at this point where it's like
2986.12s: Bolivia or anything, but it's not Switzerland now either.
2991.64s: And we have seen sovereign nations have defaults before.
2995.40s: Like and reasonably big sovereign nations,
3000.28s: like I don't know what the biggest economy
3002.72s: they have a default has been, but I don't know,
3005.80s: because Italy defaulted, Mexico has defaulted
3007.60s: a whole bunch of times, Mexico's huge.
3010.00s: So if it did, I don't think the world would end.
3014.72s: Obviously it would be bad for the US markets,
3017.04s: but I don't think the market would crash 50% or anything.
3021.20s: Right. Yeah, that makes sense.
3023.24s: It's somewhat ludicrous that Congress can authorize spending
3026.64s: and then decide not to pay for it.
3028.84s: It's so funny you say that.
3030.44s: I had an economist on the podcast last week
3033.84s: and that was actually one of the questions
3035.04s: I was talking to him about, because to me,
3037.28s: it seems so strange to create a budget
3040.08s: with the known spend, projected spends,
3042.36s: like we know where we're going and yet we come into this.
3046.36s: And I was also looking at the frequency specifically
3049.92s: because I think like 1917 or something like that
3052.84s: is when it was first instituted the debt ceiling.
3055.64s: And then in the 40s is when it was starting
3057.32s: being activated a lot more, but like in the last two decades
3060.76s: is when we're having them at a decent clip.
3064.16s: And to me, yeah, I just struggle with it.
3067.20s: Like to me, it makes no fucking sense.
3068.76s: Like we know where things are going.
3070.64s: Why is this happening?
3071.88s: Why don't we just have a bigger budget
3074.00s: or whatever the fuck is or not overspend?
3076.24s: But yeah, here we are.
3078.36s: Well, right, it's not even about the level of spending.
3081.20s: It's the fact that these are two separate processes.
3084.16s: I mean, that's just no matter what you believe
3087.36s: about government spending levels,
3088.88s: that is just ridiculously done.
3091.32s: And it's one of those things that people kind of,
3093.64s: I think up until recently kind of just accepted
3097.16s: because it didn't happen that often.
3099.24s: But also it wouldn't happen.
3100.92s: I don't think anywhere else in the world this could happen.
3103.04s: The government could authorize spending and then say,
3105.16s: oh, by the way, we're not paying for the stuff
3106.84s: which is we were going to pay for.
3108.48s: Right.
3109.32s: Without defaulting, right?
3110.60s: That is like, I'm voting to spend this money.
3113.52s: Now I'm voting that we can't spend this money.
3116.36s: Like, just welcome to America.
3118.92s: This makes no sense at all.
3122.16s: Well, you know, it's how America does what it does, right?
3125.40s: You never let them know your next move
3127.04s: because we don't know our next fucking move.
3129.40s: Well, it's a lot of the stuff about the American bulls
3136.84s: political system.
3139.80s: There's always a reason why each incremental step
3142.96s: happened, right?
3143.80s: So we know why the electoral college came about.
3146.76s: I get that.
3147.80s: We know why the Senate has the structure it has.
3151.28s: On the other hand, it is goddess to a place
3153.72s: that makes no sense.
3155.28s: Right.
3156.12s: And it's like, I don't think it's a coincidence
3157.92s: that every other democracy that's come along since
3161.04s: had a chance to look at the American system.
3163.88s: And no one has said, we've got to go with that.
3167.08s: So that's what yeah, they've really worked that one out.
3170.72s: It's yeah.
3172.52s: And these are even like democratic governments
3175.00s: that the Americans have installed.
3177.96s: Like they didn't go to Afghanistan and said,
3179.68s: come on guys, where's your electoral college?
3183.68s: Yeah, it's it's interesting.
3185.12s: And I think the part that always I find so intriguing
3187.64s: about it is like, I know these aren't stupid people.
3189.96s: That's what I always go back to is sure, you know,
3192.92s: they have their leanings and all that kind of stuff.
3194.92s: But most of the people there, they're legitimately not dumb.
3198.76s: So it just tells you the amount of structural stuff
3202.44s: around that kind of puts us in these interesting scenarios.
3208.00s: Yeah, there's a whole bunch of problems, right?
3210.24s: I think the fact that the highest level
3212.96s: of the civil service is political appointees
3216.68s: always creates this level of takes
3219.88s: wild for people to get up to speed.
3221.92s: Right.
3222.92s: As opposed to the certainly the Commonwealth countries
3225.44s: whether the civil services or, you know, that's their job.
3230.28s: It's not a political appointment.
3232.40s: So even if the politicians are all completely idiotic,
3235.96s: the underlying machinery is run by people
3238.72s: who know how to run that thing.
3241.60s: It's, you know, it's like, and the military interestingly
3245.00s: doesn't have this, right?
3247.44s: I mean, the joint chiefs of staff are not like
3250.52s: some guy who was a good campaign contributor, right?
3253.56s: I mean, it's no, it's, it's got some ad ball.
3256.24s: He spent 40 years in the Navy.
3258.56s: But we don't do that with a lot of the other departments.
3262.92s: Yeah, that's actually kind of an interesting juxtaposition, huh?
3267.16s: Well, I think it probably tells us something, right?
3271.24s: Yeah, I mean, and it's easy to make fun of, you know,
3273.72s: there's the whole catch 22 and mash and everything
3277.52s: about how the army is run so ridiculously.
3280.96s: And a microvival, it kind of is, but it has a huge logistics
3284.20s: operation. It's amazing.
3286.44s: So I mean, it's really good at like, forget about the
3291.48s: blowing things up there.
3292.84s: The fact that the American military can put thousands of
3297.04s: tons of provisions anywhere in the world in a matter of days.
3301.36s: It's incredible.
3302.64s: Yep.
3303.80s: Yep.
3304.60s: And I mean, you're, I'm a former logistician.
3306.60s: So that's literally what, what we would do is we would look at how
3310.40s: to put a giant force off of somebody's doorstep and be ready to
3314.72s: put them closer, if need be.
3316.84s: And it's exactly that point.
3318.20s: It's funny like if you read anything with Sun Zoo or, you know,
3321.76s: we're classmates.
3323.40s: It's the ability to support a large fighting force that makes
3327.12s: such a massive difference.
3328.20s: So yeah, it's logistics of when wars.
3331.40s: Yeah.
3332.40s: I mean, everyone talks, you know, everyone's all enameled
3335.20s: about the special forces and all this kind of stuff.
3337.28s: But yeah, it's putting thousands and thousands of pounds of,
3342.56s: you know, munitions in the right place is what you need.
3345.36s: It doesn't matter how good your troops are if they can't eat.
3348.84s: Right.
3349.84s: Right.
3350.84s: Wrap us up.
3351.84s: I'm curious.
3352.84s: Have you done any driving?
3354.84s: Has it been nice weather there?
3356.84s: Has it been very nice weather?
3358.84s: I haven't read anything much.
3360.84s: I've got a few problems, well, always.
3364.16s: One of the problems is my pop-up headlights.
3368.16s: I can have a choice of one being up or both being up.
3372.52s: So I have to have both of them up all the time at the moment.
3375.32s: So I've got to get that fixed.
3377.52s: Also, my wipers aren't working.
3379.60s: Which car is this?
3381.28s: That's the 456.
3383.60s: Got it.
3384.28s: The 308 I think is working fine.
3386.04s: But I haven't taken it out yet because the weather hasn't been
3388.52s: very good.
3390.68s: And also now that you've said that, I'm sure when you sit
3393.76s: in the car, it probably will have heard that in the ether.
3396.80s: And then it will find something to be upset about.
3399.16s: Well, yeah, I mean, obviously things always break.
3403.36s: Also, it might be too hot now.
3404.96s: You don't really want to be driving an 80 degree weather.
3407.84s: Well, 80 plus gets too hot.
3410.20s: Are they, is that one air cooled or?
3413.52s: No, it's not so much the engine.
3415.52s: The engine's fine.
3416.28s: It's neat.
3417.56s: Got it.
3418.40s: Oh, okay.
3419.40s: The roof of it.
3420.40s: So it acts like a little, it's got big windows, big engine
3424.64s: behind you.
3425.64s: X like a little greenhouse.
3426.64s: Yeah, okay.
3427.64s: It doesn't really do anything.
3429.12s: And if you take the roof off, you just end up getting
3432.16s: sunstroke.
3433.16s: Got it.
3434.16s: Yeah, because I was going to say that's, it would be mind blowing
3436.12s: to me.
3437.12s: I know there are some people that do air cool conversions just
3439.52s: for two different purposes.
3441.32s: But it would have been really interesting to me if you did that.
3444.12s: So the gross heat factor makes a lot more sense.
3447.12s: No, the gas.
3448.36s: It's fine.
3449.36s: Right.
3450.36s: Just that I would probably die.
3453.60s: Yeah.
3454.60s: It gets really hot in there.
3456.64s: Well, instead of going to a sauna, you just go for a drive, you
3459.64s: know.
3460.64s: Yeah, I also get deaf.
3462.72s: You don't get deaf in the sauna.
3464.60s: There's, yeah, the cars and coffee.
3468.00s: I think I sent you a photo of a 48.
3470.20s: I saw there one time, but there was a 40 this past weekend.
3473.76s: That was just absolutely gorgeous.
3477.32s: Beautiful car.
3478.32s: I've never been a huge fan of them, to be honest.
3480.56s: There are a little extreme.
3481.64s: And it seems like based on your cars, at least of what I know
3483.88s: that you have, it definitely seems contrary to your general
3486.44s: style.
3487.44s: But for what they are, 288, a lot.
3491.24s: Right.
3492.24s: You know, because it's basically a 308 on a Lloyds.
3494.92s: I mean, it's got no panels the same as a 308, but it looks like
3498.28s: a bigger one.
3501.08s: But I don't know.
3503.00s: That's an old car, you know, in an old super high performance
3507.28s: car, just a lot of work.
3509.32s: Probably isn't much fun to drive.
3511.72s: Yeah, I never been in one myself, but I remember I looked into it.
3515.40s: And I'm not like huge or anything, but the seat was so narrow.
3521.32s: I was just looking at it as.
3523.20s: Oh, yeah, it's got the big bolstered seats, right?
3525.80s: Exactly.
3526.80s: Yeah.
3527.80s: It's actually a bit weird.
3528.80s: A lot of the like the 308's got really, really, really thin seats.
3532.32s: Because you know, they're astonishingly comfortable.
3536.60s: I mean, for what they look like, you think there's no padding at all.
3540.28s: And they're actually, they fit me perfectly.
3541.88s: Well, I feel like you also kind of learn to respect the ergonomics of the seat as compared
3547.00s: to, you know, how much thickness or cushion there is.
3550.00s: If you have a well shaped, actually think, yeah, it makes a ton of sense that that would
3555.20s: be way more comfortable.
3556.56s: What do you think about the, the Lamborghini Diablos?
3560.52s: Well, Diablos, nice.
3562.32s: Okay.
3563.32s: It's like the last, the last real Lamborghini.
3565.52s: Yeah, I absolutely, I saw one of those.
3568.88s: Now they're just outies.
3571.36s: Yeah.
3572.36s: Yeah.
3573.36s: I don't like the Lamborghini's at all anymore, but all of the pre-outie ones are fantastic.
3576.84s: I love them.
3577.84s: Yeah.
3578.84s: The, there was a Diablo there that was just, it was so cool, especially it wasn't too
3583.72s: far away from the F40.
3585.04s: So it was kind of a chance to check on both out next to one of the other.
3587.44s: But hopefully the weather gets a little bit more decent for you guys there to get some
3592.08s: wheel time in.
3594.08s: I don't know, it's been cloudy here, but at least temperate.
3596.40s: So it's actually been pretty good driving here.
3598.76s: Yeah, we've, it's been overcast here a lot.
3601.32s: Overcast kind of dull.
3602.72s: This is the first hot day we've got.
3604.12s: I don't know how hot it is.
3605.36s: It's probably like 90.
3606.36s: It got hot today.
3607.96s: Yeah.
3608.96s: Starting off the summer with the bang, I suppose.
3612.56s: Yeah.
3613.56s: Well, it was a long time coming, but yeah, it's hot.
3616.76s: Yeah.
3617.76s: Well, you and thanks so much for hanging out.
3619.44s: I honestly, I just have a blast chatting with you.
3621.48s: So thanks for sharing some of your experience with folks, talking some cars and looking
3626.44s: forward to the next course.
3627.52s: Whenever that gets announced, let me know.
3629.40s: I'm happy to share with my community and yeah, get people in front of you because you
3633.24s: share a lot of awesome information.
3634.52s: So thank you.
3635.52s: Well, thanks for chatting.
3636.52s: Enjoyed it.
3637.52s: Of course, take care of you.
3639.00s: Thanks, partner.
