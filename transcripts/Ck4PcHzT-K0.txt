776.00s:  But we are going to take a pretty close look at deepseek.
779.12s:  I want to understand the supplier relationships.
782.40s:  We're going to get pretty far into detail on deepseek today just because it's a really
787.32s:  interesting opportunity.
788.52s:  It's an opportunity to explore because you now get a chance to see how the market is
796.48s:  still so reactive.
799.48s:  And this is important.
800.88s:  The market being so reactive is still unbelievably fantastic from a volatility trading perspective.
807.12s:  On fact, one of the reasons why I rotated specifically from Upro into SSO is because
817.00s:  I ran an analysis on IV adjusted return on risk using the variance in implied volatility
827.76s:  for the stock, the risk of the trades, and then the returns that I was seeing in the
831.84s:  underlying and funny enough, with volatility so high, it's actually slightly more optimal
839.40s:  to be an SSO versus Upro as it sits today.
842.88s:  Now there's a little bit of a liquidity concern and stuff like that, but that's another
849.92s:  story based on how we manage the position itself.
853.80s:  So let's take a look at deepseek as a company.
859.32s:  So I'm actually going to pull up deepseek stock overview and we're going to go through
868.92s:  a bunch of things related to this.
877.52s:  I don't want most of these are tied funny enough to Nvidia.
885.56s:  Everybody's worried about Nvidia because Nvidia obviously is at like the absolute front
891.48s:  of this overall trilling decline on the market though.
895.84s:  Huge, huge, huge decline on the day, which is actually kind of crazy.
903.76s:  And then let's grab a couple more things.
910.76s:  No, this one will look at this one will look at.
932.28s:  So, this is from JP Morgan, I haven't read these yet, I just grabbed him right now.
938.56s:  This says deepseeks latest AI model, PROMS market, friendsy, but investors should remember
943.16s:  to stay the course.
944.60s:  This obviously, okay, a quick admin note, think of the lens that we're talking about right
950.72s:  now.
951.72s:  We're talking about this from the lens of JP Morgan, which is a huge company that has
957.08s:  a lot of clients.
960.48s:  So right now they're trying to say to their clients, I'm fucked down, going to be all right.
967.16s:  That's what they're doing right now.
968.52s:  So really important to know that because I want to see what else they come up with, but
974.72s:  let's let's go through here.
976.60s:  All right.
977.60s:  So today markets have been adjusting to a new threat AI model challenging many assumptions
982.94s:  about technology dominance.
985.04s:  Here's the thing.
988.24s:  As we go through this, one important note, and this is not to get into like US versus
995.70s:  China and all that stuff.
997.16s:  I don't really care for that dialogue on this stream, but China isn't fully known for
1006.20s:  being the most forthcoming country that exists.
1010.80s:  We could they're not the most forthcoming about everything.
1014.12s:  So that being said, as there are a lot of these different claims related to the cost
1021.12s:  of training the model, the model's utilization of various chips and stuff.
1027.52s:  We kind of have to take some of that with a fucking giant grain of salt.
1031.76s:  Now the reason why that's being highlighted here is because whenever we look through
1037.20s:  different news sources, you have to identify the perspective and paradigm of whatever
1044.04s:  it is that we're looking at.
1045.64s:  So as deep seek part of China, China has a completely different media structure, different
1054.04s:  business structure.
1055.76s:  China is not known to be business friendly, that kind of stuff.
1059.04s:  There's going to be a lot of skew with what is being shared.
1062.56s:  It's the same thing.
1063.56s:  Again, most of you know that I'm military, right?
1066.20s:  So when we're watching from a military perspective and you see China talking about coming
1070.92s:  up on a six gen fighter and then you look at it, you're like, bitch, that's not really
1076.12s:  a six gen fighter, but you know, that's what they're calling it.
1080.00s:  That's what the branding it.
1081.36s:  So it's I'm not saying that this isn't the case.
1084.24s:  This actually looks like there's a pretty significant amount of validity behind what they're
1090.20s:  saying.
1091.20s:  But we have to take some of this with a massive grain of salt in terms of training costs,
1096.24s:  training models, which is a really big focus for AI tools because training is super time
1102.12s:  intensive and expensive.
1104.04s:  So now as we pivot to reading an article from JP Morgan, this is a well look wealth management.
1111.00s:  It's literally telling you right up front what they are.
1113.52s:  They have clients money and right now they've been telling all their clients for the last
1118.00s:  year, bet the house on Nvidia.
1121.36s:  This is going to styroch it up because that's literally at the core of AI.
1126.80s:  And then today it's down 17%.
1129.84s:  So JP Morgan today is getting hit up by tons of their clients being like, yo, bitch, what
1135.56s:  the fuck, where's my money at?
1137.52s:  Because this is not what I thought we were doing here.
1141.12s:  So the perspective of all of this stuff is really important to keep in mind.
1148.88s:  Okay.
1150.64s:  So let's continue deep seek a two year old Chinese startup launched its latest model early
1156.24s:  last week.
1157.56s:  That's when the model launched early last week, early last week.
1163.44s:  Why am I belaboring that point?
1165.20s:  Because early last week the market didn't give a fuck.
1169.20s:  Okay.
1170.20s:  The model is an open reasoning large language model LLM.
1174.00s:  So this is very, very similar to what we see from primary market offerings from domestic
1181.56s:  side from the US today.
1183.40s:  And it was developed using adaptations from Meta's open source LLM.
1188.28s:  Critically deep seeks latest model matches the performance of open AI's cutting edge models
1194.36s:  across math, coding and reasoning tasks at a reported approximately 95% discount to
1203.64s:  operate and train.
1208.08s:  Well, hot damn.
1209.84s:  That seems pretty sick, doesn't it?
1212.36s:  Pretty big deal.
1213.36s:  So let's continue.
1214.36s:  Oh, that's actually funny.
1215.36s:  I literally didn't even read this.
1218.24s:  What's the big deal?
1219.68s:  The market is worried that their cost efficiency threatens the assumed dominance in valuation
1226.36s:  premium that leading US semiconductor infrastructure companies have enjoyed.
1232.20s:  Indeed, some of the stocks that are taking the biggest hits so far, these different companies,
1236.56s:  some of the hyper scalars who were driving AI capital expenditures are down on the day,
1240.92s:  but outperforming the stocks that are more levered to AI infrastructure.
1245.68s:  So here's the next question.
1248.96s:  How is it that the large language model itself is causing semiconductor and infrastructure
1259.00s:  companies to contract?
1261.80s:  The large language model itself still requires semiconductors and infrastructure in order
1270.40s:  to do the thing as an LLM.
1275.52s:  Another really important relationship to pay attention to as we continue working through
1280.96s:  this.
1282.92s:  Concentration of the US large cap stock market and mega cap names is a risk facing investors
1288.04s:  in 2025.
1289.52s:  This is talking about the centralization of mega cap as a percentage of the overall stock
1293.36s:  market, which is a massive number.
1294.84s:  I don't know what it is today.
1295.84s:  I'll find out for you right now at a curiosity.
1298.84s:  What percentage I'm asking, ChatGPT?
1302.40s:  What percentage of the US stock market cap is accounted for by mag seven companies?
1318.92s:  Actually, I don't know the answer to this right now.
1322.84s:  Let's see what GPT comes up with.
1329.64s:  They account for 35% of the S&P 500 market capitalization.
1335.44s:  And then for those that don't know, the S&P 500 represents about 80% of the total stock
1340.72s:  market capitalization.
1342.44s:  So those seven companies represent just shy of 30%, like 28% or 20%, I don't fucking
1348.24s:  know, high 20%.
1350.88s:  So this is an important element to outline without a doubt.
1356.56s:  And this is something that is going to be brand new, especially for people that are used
1360.64s:  to approaching this whole thing from an investor standpoint, from an investor standpoint, you're
1364.72s:  taught by an index ETF.
1366.60s:  It's diversified.
1367.92s:  But now when you buy an index ETF, you're kind of getting 35% of the same shit.
1373.56s:  That's not super diversified based on the original principles.
1377.40s:  That's actually why you see a rise in the utilization of like equal weighted S&P 500 indices and
1384.60s:  stuff like that.
1385.92s:  Because some people are starting to get a little nervous about the hyper concentration.
1392.44s:  So just another note to keep in mind.
1395.80s:  Okay, let us continue.
1398.32s:  Next, AI opportunity is not a monolith, monolith, monolith.
1405.16s:  That's funny.
1406.16s:  So my brain thought monolith, which for those that don't know, that's actually a squat
1411.04s:  tool that is really expensive, but it's super cool.
1415.40s:  It's a way to be completely free out of the rack so that you don't have to do a step
1420.68s:  out.
1421.68s:  So you un-rack the bar.
1422.68s:  It's levers that your friend, if you have a friend will pull, move the holds out of the
1426.56s:  way.
1427.56s:  Anyways, that's a monolith, which is different than monolith.
1431.28s:  Jevons Paradox states that increased efficiency can lead to increased consumption of a resource.
1436.08s:  Lower cost for AI models could lead to faster.
1438.76s:  This is exactly what I was thinking.
1440.68s:  Could lead to faster adoption by corporations and households.
1444.44s:  Further, the drop in the headline stock index masks some encouraging performance underneath
1449.64s:  the surface.
1450.92s:  The average stock is down only 15 basis points that are up.
1454.32s:  This is, it's literally funny and I have to be honest.
1457.00s:  I also didn't know that it was called Jevons Paradox, but this is exactly what's one of
1463.12s:  the points I've wanted to share with you at least from my own perspective, which apparently
1467.00s:  now is known as Jevons Paradox, where increased efficiency typically leads to increased consumption
1474.64s:  because you can apply it in more places net, net.
1478.60s:  So the overall 95% growth and efficiency, first of all, is great because that means other
1488.72s:  AI tools are also going to search to be as efficient as humanly possible.
1495.92s:  And my expectation is that I don't think anything in China is going to be so incredibly
1505.80s:  disparate from what's available here in the US.
1508.88s:  So then that means they're going to be jockeying back and forth, who's in the lead, who's slightly
1513.92s:  behind.
1514.92s:  But all of that as the overall field of AI grows in terms of adoption scope, that's
1523.08s:  going to benefit all of these different AI companies.
1525.32s:  They're all going to become smarter, more efficient, better deployed.
1528.28s:  And then it's going to impact other areas of the economy, which is a big factor for this
1534.08s:  entire move that you see today and the expectation.
1538.40s:  So again, to reiterate, right now to me, it looks like short term sentiment got caught
1542.44s:  off sides.
1544.28s:  After hours, e-minis are up just a little bit.
1546.72s:  The Russell, the Russell can't catch a fucking break to save its life.
1550.28s:  It's down almost 0.2%.
1552.72s:  And the NASDAQ is up 0.21%.
1556.24s:  It's down 0.06 Bitcoin up a quarter point, gold up near half a point, crude up 0.15%.
1568.48s:  Bonds down a quarter, eath up half.
1571.96s:  And then corn is still on a fucking tear.
1575.20s:  Corn has been crushing it.
1578.32s:  So wheat is up a little bit.
1580.60s:  Soybeans up not too much.
1582.20s:  Okay.
1583.36s:  Right now it looks pretty mellow.
1586.28s:  So further the drop that I know we already read all that's okay.
1590.92s:  Here we go.
1591.92s:  There are still many unanswered questions to the validity of the model, the true cost
1597.20s:  to train it and its implication for US tech firms.
1600.68s:  Huge.
1601.92s:  This is exactly what we started discussing from the very, very beginning that again, as
1609.52s:  super friendly as we are with China and as well known they are for being completely
1615.12s:  forthright up front and fair in what they're sharing.
1621.40s:  Everybody's like, I don't fucking know about that.
1624.08s:  95% is huge.
1626.12s:  Now I can tell you what the market will be thinking is even if it's a third of that in true
1631.84s:  cost savings, that's still huge.
1633.84s:  It's still huge.
1635.04s:  So the impact will still be there.
1637.68s:  So the bottom line according to JP Morgan, we expect the AI trying to continue to drive
1642.20s:  economic and market outcomes.
1644.04s:  However, continued competition innovation will create winners and losers on the surface
1647.80s:  of equity indices.
1648.80s:  I want to reiterate this point.
1651.56s:  If you think that continued competition or is, you know, just going to show us the same
1660.56s:  names, you're completely wrong.
1662.80s:  You are completely wrong.
1664.88s:  There is a significant, significant chance that the true leaders of AI are names that
1672.16s:  you don't even know yet.
1673.96s:  That's, we've seen this with innovation every time we go through big technological innovations.
1680.44s:  You will notice that exact thing, that some of the big names that are going to lead this
1687.84s:  going forward and become just huge companies.
1691.40s:  You don't even know the names yet.
1692.68s:  You have to look for them and there's some of them that we'll talk about.
1696.48s:  We encourage investors to look for opportunity while maintaining overall portfolio resilient
1700.20s:  to shocks and that.
1702.20s:  Yeah, great.
1703.52s:  Okay, I actually like this.
1706.12s:  In case you guys need to connect with a wealth advisor from JP Morgan, you can hit him up
1711.72s:  here.
1712.72s:  They can, you know, hook you up with putting you in an Nvidia and then making sure that
1716.96s:  you stay in it when it drops 16 points in a day.
1720.24s:  Okay, over to IBD deep seek developed its AI system without cutting edge.
1729.68s:  Born processors, which China restricted from a table obtaining due to US export curves.
1735.56s:  This is important because I still believe that our processors are superior to theirs.
1740.04s:  So even if they found a way to be more efficient with what they have, that means that what's
1744.56s:  potential for us is huge.
1747.28s:  Think of it as the five minute mile.
1749.52s:  I think for everybody for the longest time, everybody thought that the five minute
1753.22s:  mile just couldn't be broken.
1755.08s:  And then some dude, I don't know who it was, ended up breaking the five minute mile
1758.58s:  eventually.
1759.58s:  And then as soon as he broke it, motherfuckers started breaking the five minute mile,
1764.08s:  not regularly, but way more than before.
1767.04s:  So there becomes a mental barrier that becomes broken once we see that something is possible
1772.52s:  and doable.
1773.52s:  Think of it even from the perspective of being a full-time trader.
1776.36s:  Most people know that the prospects of being a full-time trader for the vast majority
1779.96s:  of people are not good.
1781.56s:  You're very much better off with buying hold in an index ETF.
1784.96s:  However, you can clearly see that some people can figure it out.
1789.48s:  Some people can make it.
1790.64s:  So then that lets you know that the shit is doable.
1792.72s:  It's the same thing here.
1794.00s:  So if we see something like deep seek being way more efficient using less optimal processors,
1801.14s:  what does that tell you?
1802.14s:  What's a potential for better technology?
1806.36s:  It's so facto.
1808.04s:  So the Chinese firm says it built its systems for less than six million.
1817.80s:  Sure.
1821.04s:  Versus the billion spent by rivals.
1822.72s:  It's also much cheaper to operate than open AI and meta.
1828.76s:  So the news comes after US venture stargate announced plans to spend as much 500 billion
1833.08s:  on AI infrastructure.
1835.32s:  Silicon Valley venture capitalist Mark Andreessen described deep seek deep seek R1 as AI's
1842.04s:  sputnik moment, which I actually agree with that.
1844.32s:  I think that that's really, really, I think it's a great analogy.
1850.76s:  When the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite in 57 kicking off the space
1855.96s:  raised.
1857.68s:  A wiretark will say deep seek focused on maximizing software driven resource optimization
1863.26s:  since it didn't have access to the latest AI processors and others.
1869.56s:  So the other thing that this starts to beg the question is since deep seek was so focused
1876.68s:  on maximizing software driven resource optimization because they didn't have better resources,
1881.92s:  what does that then mean when we think about the priorities for domestic companies that
1888.56s:  do in fact have access to better software?
1894.56s:  Probably solving more complex problems and elements than this because they're obviously
1901.24s:  needing to optimize for a specific input.
1906.04s:  They came up with more efficient methods to train its models such as using custom communication
1910.08s:  schemes between chips, reducing the size of fields to save memory and innovative use
1914.92s:  to the mix of models approach according to wired article.
1917.84s:  The other reality here is if you think about it from a legal perspective, even what things
1923.12s:  have access to train off of is going to be completely different because again, China
1930.56s:  is more dictatorial.
1932.24s:  So they can essentially just say that they models can train off whatever the fuck they want.
1937.52s:  As in the US, there is a ton of legal battles going on right now about what the models can
1942.88s:  or can't use because we actually shocker somewhat value the individual autonomy over their
1950.32s:  own information.
1953.00s:  So that's not directly tied to size of fields, different communication schemes, but that
1959.96s:  is another element to bake into this.
1964.72s:  Now again, the cool part about it is regardless of what route they go, there's still a lot
1970.48s:  of opportunity here for pretty much everybody involved.
1974.08s:  Okay.
1975.08s:  Deepseek news could lead to a pause in AI infrastructure spending by hyper scale cloud service providers
1982.04s:  as they rethink their capital expenditure plans.
1984.04s:  Ever core ISI analysts emit, that's a fucking name, dare, dare, y'all, nanny, dare, dare,
1994.88s:  dare, y'all, nanny said in a client note Monday, we think some of the risks near term
1999.88s:  will be around do we need to spend as much catbacks given a cheaper alternative?
2003.88s:  It's likely that over time this will end up being the scenario where cloud enterprises
2007.88s:  can do even more AI centric work beyond text images and video yet completely agree with
2011.80s:  that.
2012.80s:  Here we go.
2013.80s:  This couldn't agree with anymore.
2016.84s:  Deepseek panic seems overblown and this will lead into what opportunities are probably
2021.84s:  here for us.
2023.00s:  Bernstein analyst, Dacey Razgin, that's a fun ass name, said deepseek news does not
2030.12s:  spell doomsday for AI buildouts, the resulting Twitterverse panic and its X verse get your
2035.40s:  shit right.
2036.88s:  Razgin panic over the weekend seems overblown, which I agree.
2041.60s:  According to the many occasionally hysterical hot takes we saw the implications range anywhere
2047.40s:  from that's really interesting to this is the death death now.
2052.00s:  I don't know what this is.
2054.36s:  What's death now of the AI infrastructure of the AI infrastructure complexes we know
2059.80s:  I need to learn what this is.
2061.64s:  What is this?
2065.00s:  The tolling of a bell to mark someone's death.
2069.04s:  Shit.
2070.04s:  Fun fact, there's something I learned today.
2076.72s:  This is sick.
2079.56s:  I didn't know how many people knew this.
2082.60s:  That's a cool ass like that.
2086.16s:  Like that bell too.
2088.92s:  Could deepseek be China's side up?
2096.24s:  Could it?
2097.24s:  Certainly could.
2099.44s:  Deepseek impact on the AI technology supply chain all depends on the veracity of deep
2104.84s:  seaks claims.
2107.80s:  Now the funny thing is the market is obviously treating the claims with significant respect.
2115.84s:  Big, big respect.
2117.44s:  So it seems like they do believe that there is at least some degree of merit.
2124.52s:  My hypothesis would be that most people that are analyzing this information coming out
2128.40s:  of deepseek they're just again saying well rather than it cutting 95% of cost it might
2133.68s:  cut 30% of cost or whatever and essentially just guessing off of that.
2143.04s:  Let's get into this last one really quick and then we'll pivot over to start looking
2147.76s:  at some opportunities.
2153.92s:  Anything stick out here.
2160.44s:  Cost outside AI related industries held up much better which funny enough the financial
2166.00s:  sector is still looking pretty good.
2174.48s:  We already know the source of all this stuff.
2180.56s:  Okay.
2183.04s:  So you guys already know all these details which is good.
2189.48s:  Okay.
2191.72s:  Nothing new jumping out of me here.
2193.40s:  Let's take a look at the market now.
2197.00s:  So a couple of things we did in the NASDAQ roll over to net lows and in the New York stock
2205.96s:  exchange also rolled over to net lows.
2209.76s:  This is representative of a broader change in breadth as compared to what we've been
2215.44s:  seeing previously.
2217.44s:  Port and no.
2218.76s:  We can see volatility popped and volatility contracted.
2222.76s:  I had a short trade in volatility once it broke above 20 and a half.
2228.48s:  So it actually got a little more painful while I was in it not much and I took down most
2233.00s:  of it at the end of the day today and we'll probably look to take the rest of that down
2237.08s:  tomorrow.
2238.16s:  This again is just a very, very standard trade that I continue to run in volatility based
2243.56s:  on the current paradigm.
2249.60s:  Zachary says market isn't efficient no matter how much they tell themselves.
2253.72s:  It is.
2254.72s:  The market is efficient.
2256.28s:  It's just not perfectly efficient.
2258.12s:  G36 says it's not efficient at all indeed.
2261.48s:  That definitely is.
2263.20s:  The market is efficient.
2266.12s:  The thing is is our expectation when we hear the word efficient is probably skewed
2273.48s:  by not understanding the totality of what a market is actually doing.
2278.36s:  That's my guess why some people might think that it's not efficient but it definitely
2283.72s:  is efficient without it out.
2286.24s:  Okay, let's get back to the market overview.
2292.20s:  Fonds up slightly Bitcoin trending sideways still hovering around this 100 handle.
2298.84s:  Those leveling off comm services big update, comm services big update.
2304.48s:  Take a look at tech big down day.
2308.44s:  Big update big down day.
2312.16s:  Energy rolling over still some really good shorts.
2315.16s:  We actually talked about one of them yesterday during the market prep stream that I put on
2319.28s:  today because it looked like this.
2322.76s:  It looked like it was rolling over.
2324.52s:  The fact that energy is continuing to roll over even given the big move that you saw
2328.76s:  on tech today is also a really important note because what this is telling you is that
2334.92s:  people are not running for the hills and rotating out of tech into more defense sectors like
2346.00s:  energy or like utilities.
2349.16s:  That's an important note.
2351.80s:  G36 says for the efficient market hypothesis asset prices need to reflect all information.
2357.28s:  That's incorrect.
2358.32s:  So this is a common misconception with efficient market hypothesis.
2363.08s:  There are three forms of efficient market hypothesis.
2367.64s:  What you're referring to is the strong form which even the authors of the efficient market
2372.80s:  hypothesis do not they do not a spouse that that's reflective of current markets.
2380.84s:  G36 says that's the definition.
2382.64s:  It's not.
2383.64s:  That's not the definition.
2384.76s:  They're talking about one of the forms of efficient market hypothesis.
2388.24s:  There are three forms.
2391.32s:  The idea that all information is unanimously onboarded that's part of what's called the
2395.64s:  strong form.
2397.36s:  And again, even the authors of EMH do not promote strong form is reflective of current
2403.12s:  markets.
2404.12s:  They understand that there's latency.
2408.64s:  So yeah, that's why yeah, there's a scale.
2413.08s:  Yeah, three forms to be aware of.
2415.12s:  The market is kind of more like semi strong.
2417.64s:  It's not fully strong.
2418.80s:  It's not weak.
2419.80s:  It's like semi strong.
2421.04s:  Yeah.
2423.04s:  So let's continue on.
2426.88s:  Financials baller day.
2429.12s:  Another trade that I put on today from the stream yesterday went on because we were looking
2432.96s:  at financials and financials were looking good.
2435.44s:  So they continue to run pretty effectively here.
2439.84s:  Financials gap down on the day staples.
2443.52s:  Who saw this coming?
2445.72s:  Staples.
2447.44s:  We have to take a look at staples and see what's going on in there because they finally
2452.80s:  caught a bid and interestingly enough discretionaries up at the same time.
2458.36s:  Curious.
2460.04s:  Utilities we already talked about down real estate slowly trending up and then healthcare is
2466.32s:  also on a pretty big run.
2468.16s:  Healthcare is actually starting to challenge these term highs, which would actually indicate
2473.76s:  on a short term time frame turning around within that sector.
2476.84s:  So actually very interesting movement between here and here.
2481.68s:  Naples is most interesting to me just because staples is it like it hasn't been able to
2485.44s:  catch a bid for so long that now I'm kind of like caught a bit.
2490.52s:  So super interesting.
2493.72s:  Let's take a look at the market overall.
2496.60s:  Yeah, see even with the big move today, you can see that it definitely hit tech a little
2503.24s:  bit more now for those that don't know this is looking at the exchange.
2508.20s:  This isn't like the Nasdaq ETF.
2510.72s:  This is looking at the Nasdaq exchange and this is used looking at the New York stock
2514.56s:  exchange.
2516.12s:  But even on the Nasdaq exchange, there's a lot of tech companies that tends to skew a
2520.76s:  bit more tech.
2521.76s:  So that's why you see this declining more so than you see on this side in case you didn't
2527.32s:  know.
2528.56s:  So if we take a look on a five day time frame, there's a big, big dip in companies that
2535.84s:  are making new lows, which is interesting.
2542.84s:  I'll start with saying interesting.
2545.04s:  The reason why that's interesting to me is the market is in a very delicate state.
2551.72s:  I'm going to make a change right now in my opinion based on what I've seen based on my
2555.56s:  overall analysis of stuff.
2557.84s:  And this is a little weaker than I would have expected to see.
2564.24s:  And then you can see on the number of companies that are above five day moving average, that
2569.48s:  dropped like 11 points as compared to the 20 day.
2577.80s:  And then it's compared to yesterday.
2579.68s:  Well, I guess Friday, technically, it would have dropped like four points.
2586.08s:  Okay.
2588.08s:  So let's take a look now at the sectors.
2591.44s:  We already know what we're going to find in here staples out here crushing it.
2597.16s:  Household products in beverages.
2600.80s:  Why?
2606.68s:  Why is this?
2609.68s:  Why is that up?
2613.68s:  Let's see.
2617.80s:  I just want to see what the deal is.
2624.96s:  Colgate Pepsi.
2628.96s:  I PG.
2632.92s:  So PG looks super strong on a relative basis.
2636.20s:  Let's take a look at PG.
2640.64s:  Good earnings.
2643.80s:  Small e-cout on a beat.
2646.76s:  Did well on the dividend.
2649.72s:  I'm surprised.
2651.36s:  I still don't like this to the upside personally, but it looks better to the upside than most
2657.04s:  other things I imagine we would see in here.
2658.72s:  What else?
2659.72s:  It looks interesting.
2666.72s:  HD.
2672.88s:  If only this says church of Dwight, that would be better.
2676.96s:  This is Armand Hammer.
2678.76s:  But I really like.
2681.48s:  I really like church of Dwight.
2683.44s:  I'm going to pretend that that's what it says instead.
2685.76s:  That's better for what I want it to be.
2688.92s:  And gap up today.
2691.12s:  Why did this have a gap up today?
2692.72s:  And then we'll get into the AI stuff.
2694.12s:  I'm just curious.
2695.12s:  Don't know why this gaped up today.
2697.08s:  I don't see any news on it.
2698.56s:  We'll have to figure that out.
2700.56s:  All right.
2701.56s:  Let's get over now to really the bell of the ball, which is trying to find some opportunity
2707.48s:  within the AI, the AI stocks.
2710.72s:  And I want to take a look.
2712.40s:  AI stock opportunity.
2717.20s:  I'm just updating our timestamps.
2721.20s:  And let's take a look specifically.
2724.72s:  I think Nvidia is going to be probably one of the bigger ones.
2733.20s:  So Nvidia fell directly down essentially to its 200 day moving average.
2740.48s:  And if we zoom out, go back a little further out in time.
2744.24s:  I mean, it's clearly down through this area of prior support, now likely turned resistance.
2753.48s:  Although I think that the reaction that you'll see here for Nvidia through resistance will
2760.24s:  be very, very different than other companies that are essentially trying to find their
2765.92s:  name and trying to find their value.
2768.12s:  My overarching expectation here is that I think Nvidia looks so good here.
2779.48s:  I think that even for a moderate duration trade, this looks so good here.
2785.88s:  And I already have exposure to it through T triple cues.
2789.28s:  I actually expanded my T triple cues position today, not a ton, but slightly.
2795.80s:  And there's a bunch of different reasons for that one from the volatility perspective,
2800.76s:  but two, because one of the larger proponents of T triple cues is this.
2809.12s:  And I think Nvidia looks really good here.
2814.84s:  Now it doesn't look good in my opinion to buy yet.
2821.36s:  The reason why it doesn't look good to buy yet is because whenever we have companies
2826.32s:  that have these big kind of gaps down, we have to wait until the dust settles just a
2833.48s:  little bit before we start running out and seeing if we can prospect on a position.
2840.64s:  Because single down days like this big gap down, it is a fucking crap shoot.
2846.16s:  What this can look like tomorrow.
2847.68s:  It is a crap shoot.
2848.68s:  We really, really don't know.
2850.92s:  My expectation would be given the way that futures are moving right now.
2855.24s:  My expectation is that it might be bit up a little bit if futures don't roll over.
2860.04s:  Whereas my normal temperament towards moves like this is expectation of a continuation.
2866.00s:  But we're in such a weird market right now.
2868.88s:  So the way that I look at it is from a long term investors standpoint.
2874.40s:  This is a dream.
2875.96s:  This is a really, really great area to start prospecting in.
2880.12s:  From a trader's perspective in my opinion, you have to wait.
2883.40s:  You have to exercise a tactical pause here.
2887.00s:  And I would want to see how it trends above first the 125 handle at least.
2893.44s:  And then how it does as it approaches the 130 handle.
2897.04s:  And then if it looks like it's doing well in their getting support, we're seeing volume
2902.28s:  expanding.
2903.80s:  And we're seeing the internals looking strong.
2909.76s:  Then yeah, no problem playing this as a reversal to the upside.
2913.64s:  This is essentially a mega cap version of a parabolic long, which is kind of crazy to think
2920.32s:  about because that's not how that's supposed to work with mega cap companies.
2923.80s:  But this, this.
2927.76s:  It is what it is big news today and big news absolutely move the stock.
2933.40s:  So let's take a look at the options still as huge call skew.
2939.08s:  And let's take a look at the volume for today.
2942.32s:  All of it super short term volume.
2947.08s:  5.8 million calls against 4.3 million puts.
2953.40s:  And this is a ton of people selling calls, which is exactly what I would do if I was holding
2959.12s:  in video.
2960.28s:  Now if you caught it earlier in the day, that's a great move to capture.
2965.24s:  So that doesn't surprise me in the least.
2968.72s:  But there's still a ton of people that are buying calls today, 34% of the transactions
2974.56s:  where people buying calls.
2976.12s:  So the market is not overly scared right now.
2981.72s:  At least from Nvidia's perspective, the other thing to keep in mind with Nvidia is that
2988.08s:  it had a truly parabolic ascent.
2991.80s:  And again, for really big companies, this is somewhat unnatural.
2996.36s:  So if you go back to 2023, take a look.
3000.48s:  2023 on a split adjusted basis is trading at 1376.
3007.08s:  I mean, that's an insane move for a company of this size.
3011.88s:  So when you see companies move this big, this heavy, a lot of times you will find that
3017.20s:  they're going to take a step back at some point and they need to consolidate a little
3021.80s:  bit.
3022.80s:  So this I think just happened to be exacerbated by the news that came out.
3029.04s:  But this in no way in my opinion changes the total fundamental value of the company.
3034.88s:  I think that it does potentially impact short term sentiment, which is broadly what we're
3041.48s:  seeing.
3042.64s:  So yeah, overall in video, I think it looks pretty strong.
3048.64s:  And I think in video as a general opportunity for investors, this looks great.
3054.76s:  For traders, it still looks great.
3057.20s:  It's just a matter of exercising a little more patience, taking a tactical pause, seeing
3063.56s:  how it actually pans out over the next couple days.
3067.20s:  But my expectation is that whenever it does decide to catch a bid, it will probably
3073.08s:  move up pretty quickly because lots and lots of people want to be in Nvidia because again,
3080.24s:  regardless of what's happening on this short term window, people look at Nvidia as the
3085.12s:  center of the party or AI and it's positioned its self be so.
3092.28s:  So yeah, I think they're still positioned really, really well.
3096.40s:  So let's take a look at a few other things that had pretty big moves today.
3103.40s:  I'm just scrolling through.
3112.16s:  We'll take a look at it first actually just from like a tech perspective.
3118.96s:  There it goes.
3127.16s:  And let's see what head of the biggest drops.
3130.16s:  Broadcom down huge 17% Oracle down 13%.
3136.08s:  Let's take a look at these.
3139.12s:  So the general kind of ideas that we're looking at right now are really wrapped around
3144.36s:  the reversals and the nature of playing reversals is super, super delicate.
3152.36s:  And the reason why it's so delicate is because we never know if there's going to be continuation
3157.16s:  and you have to be careful if there's continuation.
3161.32s:  So when we're trying to play reversals, at least the way that I play reversals is it's
3165.88s:  typically really, really defensive.
3168.48s:  And I don't want to step in front of the momentum, but I want to be prepared to monitor
3176.84s:  a change in momentum and then eventually the broader expectation, which is a reversal.
3184.48s:  So let's take a look at some of these other AI prominent stocks.
3188.40s:  So first we could take a look at just broadcommatic curiosity.
3192.96s:  So broadcom is different.
3201.88s:  Broadcom is different.
3208.12s:  To me, I actually favor this a bit more to the downside.
3217.96s:  Man, look at this.
3220.56s:  There's just fucking nothing here.
3229.56s:  Very interesting.
3232.56s:  You can look at the volume.
3237.28s:  Yeah, see, and you can see, you can take a look at the options markets fucking tell you.
3246.40s:  Take a look at this.
3247.84s:  The majority of puts were bought.
3250.44s:  The majority of calls were sold and there's a very small minority of calls that were actually
3256.00s:  bought.
3257.88s:  This tells you right away what the market is thinking for something like broadcom.
3262.72s:  It is not stoked.
3263.72s:  I got to pop the door for a thorn for dinner.
3277.40s:  Very, very interesting.
3288.60s:  What else did we have?
3289.60s:  We already looked at Nvidia.
3290.92s:  Let me know if there's individual names that you won't want to take a look at.
3294.48s:  And we have maybe like 10, 15 minutes left.
3297.00s:  So if there's any questions that you want to hit, now's the perfect time.
3301.84s:  I actually want to make a quick announcement for the leader board in the discord.
3308.52s:  So for those that don't know, we have a completely free discord to join.
3312.64s:  And one of the things I'm doing to support people, but then also to help people interact
3320.44s:  and help one another share information.
3324.80s:  I am doing a monthly giveaway.
3328.04s:  And it'll go to one of the top 10.
3330.88s:  It'll be random if you're in the top 10.
3334.00s:  I mean, maybe I should be eligible.
3338.72s:  But the two things you can want is just like a $10 Amazon or Starbucks gift card.
3343.04s:  The idea is just to let somebody go grab a cup of coffee on me saying thank you for participating.
3349.04s:  Or you get a 20 minute one-on-one conversation with me if you feel like wanting to fucking,
3354.12s:  I don't know, wanting to put yourself through some pain.
3357.44s:  That's also a choice.
3358.44s:  So I might be sitting here talking to myself.
3360.96s:  But the top that we have so far is, I never know how to say that.
3365.84s:  Urzule, Joe, Skyoam in and Reeks, those are our top ones.
3370.80s:  So congrats to you guys so far.
3372.80s:  We'll essentially a pick on the last day of the month.
3376.20s:  So shout out to you guys running at the front of the pack.
3381.76s:  Okay.
3382.76s:  The other thing that I want to take a look at now though is the pro workbook.
3393.72s:  And then I just want to see if there's any questions from the pro members fast.
3398.32s:  So Amadez is asking, could you run through the pros and cons of a poor man's covered call?
3403.12s:  Specifically, I was thinking one for cues or TQs, which I suppose then begs the question
3409.36s:  of comparing covered strangle to a poor man's covered call.
3411.84s:  I see.
3412.64s:  This is a completely great question.
3414.12s:  So it really comes down to leverage.
3416.56s:  That's the that's the cliff notes version.
3419.00s:  So the way to think through this and to decipher.
3423.80s:  If you want to trade the poor man's covered call, or if you want to trade a covered
3432.64s:  strangle, comes down to leverage and holding duration.
3436.96s:  Because the other reality of this is let's say that you want to have a slightly longer
3443.32s:  or shorter holding duration.
3446.08s:  That's actually a pretty big impact in terms of when we think we might want to base the
3454.92s:  position or put the position on.
3456.88s:  So yeah, completely great question.
3460.28s:  But that's the that's the cliff notes version.
3462.20s:  I realize I need to add a link to the stream for these people so that they can easily find
3467.04s:  it.
3468.04s:  We don't want that.
3471.20s:  We want that.
3473.40s:  So yeah, that's the answer.
3474.56s:  It comes down to holding duration.
3476.60s:  If I'm holding something for a longer period of time, then I can either go really far out
3481.60s:  with the base of the ratio called the Agnol.
3484.48s:  But the main element is do you want the leverage or not?
3491.20s:  That's the big difference.
3493.00s:  Now the other thing with the poor man's covered call for those that don't know that's long
3498.56s:  typically people will do it at the money, which is different than what I do.
3502.56s:  The other recommendation I would have here is actually to explore a ratio called Agnol,
3509.92s:  which is my variant essentially of that strategy.
3515.40s:  And I think it's just just way better, literally way better.
3519.88s:  So I will grab a link to this as well so that you have this for your reference.
3532.08s:  RCD video.
3538.72s:  That's the ratio diagonal.
3544.84s:  And then this is the other RCD video.
3547.60s:  Cool.
3548.84s:  All right, cool.
3550.04s:  So we're caught up on the pro cues now happy to dive into really anything else that you
3559.72s:  all want to take a look at or you all want to talk about.
3563.72s:  James says eBay for breakout.
3565.76s:  Let's take a look.
3567.24s:  No.
3571.80s:  Definitely not.
3575.64s:  The reason why definitely not is a few reasons prior earnings had a good earnings release,
3587.68s:  but then a really big gap down.
3590.56s:  So I don't like that.
3592.20s:  I also don't like this massive gap up and then a run down.
3596.80s:  That doesn't mean that this still can't be traded to the upside.
3600.12s:  It certainly can, but this would not be bucketed as a breakout strategy for me personally.
3608.56s:  So yeah, that's my that's my point of two.
3616.56s:  And then I got to let Falco be answered as question.
3627.80s:  What else we got?
3635.80s:  G 36 is if you want to go long options, then you may want IV to drop unless you expect IV
3642.12s:  to expand further.
3643.40s:  Did you say I'm confused?
3647.36s:  I don't know what that's in response to.
3649.88s:  Oh, here we go.
3651.08s:  Amir says, Hi, Eric, what do you mean by waiting for the dust to settle before trading?
3656.76s:  Is there a way to measure that in terms of waiting for the IV to drop?
3660.52s:  Yeah.
3661.52s:  So what I'm referring to, Amir, that's a great question is I'm referring specifically.
3666.04s:  I think we were talking what about Nvidia.
3668.64s:  Is that correct?
3669.64s:  I realize that I missed that question from up above.
3673.44s:  Amir, let me know if that's the correct reference that we were talking about in video.
3679.48s:  Yeah.
3680.48s:  Okay.
3681.48s:  Cool.
3682.48s:  Thank you.
3683.48s:  Yeah.
3684.48s:  So what I'm talking about waiting for the dust to settle, I'm talking about the price action.
3685.48s:  I'm talking about waiting to see if price starts to show continuation or if price starts
3692.16s:  to show reversal or consolidation.
3695.12s:  So waiting for the dust to settle, taking a tactical pause, it's the same thing.
3699.08s:  It's just waiting and it's watching because one of the worst things people can do from
3703.48s:  a trader's perspective is start jumping in now.
3708.12s:  If you start jumping in now, you could time it perfectly and that would be great.
3713.04s:  You could completely miss time it and tie a bunch of money up and then have to just
3718.62s:  deal with your money being in a trade that's not working well, get stopped out too fast.
3722.40s:  And there's generally little reward for trying to take the entry that fast.
3727.60s:  So what I mean by that is generally speaking, not always, you will give up some edge here
3732.84s:  in terms of perfect pricing, but you're balancing perfect pricing with probabilities.
3738.24s:  So what this means is the probability of you picking the exact turnaround point in the
3745.62s:  middle of a move is not really great.
3749.48s:  That essentially comes down to how well could you possibly gauge and understand market sentiment,
3755.80s:  which I think to elucidate that point further, how many of us expected in video the company
3761.24s:  to be down 17% today?
3763.20s:  I didn't.
3764.20s:  I expected it to be down for sure.
3766.88s:  That's why I was trading short e-minis, but I didn't expect 17%.
3772.56s:  That's a big fucking move.
3774.48s:  So the point I'm showing you is that even though even somebody like me that's pretty experienced
3778.94s:  at this stuff, I had a hunch.
3781.08s:  I had an idea that direction was moderately correct, but the severity would have been way
3785.12s:  off.
3786.12s:  I definitely wouldn't have even expected 10%.
3788.60s:  So the severity of my assumption was way off.
3791.68s:  So the point there is, it's really difficult to tell when the turnaround is actually there
3799.24s:  if there's a turnaround.
3801.12s:  So rather than trying to what we would refer to as a bottom ticket, meaning getting the
3806.12s:  best lowest price before it starts to reverse, we can just wait and we can see how it behaves
3815.20s:  and a great reference is something like this here, right?
3818.16s:  Just use this as a model red down day.
3821.28s:  So it had a gap down, had a big, big red down day, and then the next day, gap down again,
3828.48s:  rallied up, rallied back down, and it trended sideways for like five days.
3833.36s:  Now again, if you're an investor, who gives a shit?
3836.48s:  If you're an investor, this is great.
3839.28s:  From an investor's perspective, this move is fantastic.
3843.88s:  But that's a really long-term time frame and the entire nature of an investor is where
3848.12s:  sacrificing short-term performance and overall performance for ease, simplicity, and less
3857.64s:  interaction with the market.
3859.20s:  That's the nature of investing.
3861.12s:  So if it's a long-term position from an investor's perspective, they might not care if it goes
3866.80s:  from 118 down to 90, because if they're going to look at it in eight, ten years, it'll
3872.40s:  probably be higher in eight, ten years.
3875.32s:  It could have a period where it looks really ugly in the mean term.
3879.20s:  So from an investor's lens, very different from a trader's lens, because from a trader's
3884.24s:  lens, if I want to trade this to the long side, why the fuck would I get in now as it's
3889.36s:  going down?
3890.36s:  I need to wait and see if it's going to consolidate, if it's going to start rallying because it
3896.36s:  could continue to keep going down.
3898.60s:  Now what do I sack her face by doing that?
3901.44s:  Well, I'm not going to bottom-ticket.
3902.96s:  I'm not going to get the exact lowest point before it starts to rally.
3907.60s:  I'm naturally going to give that up.
3909.00s:  I'm purposefully giving that up so that I have a higher probability of being correct when
3913.64s:  it finally does.
3914.96s:  So going back to this example, stock dropped, gap down the next day, inside day, another
3921.00s:  day, kind of sideways, dropped, then it started consolidating again, and then you have a little
3927.20s:  bit of an update.
3928.44s:  Then you have another pretty big confirmatory update.
3932.28s:  As these three updates are occurring, you can see that the volume is slightly expanding,
3937.72s:  but it's by side volume.
3940.28s:  So this is the entire nature of trading is to keep an eyeball on what it's doing, analyze
3945.44s:  it, and then make a trading decision based on just the overall performance of it.
3950.16s:  So here what I can tell you is volume contracting.
3955.40s:  Cell-side volume expanding, then today massive cell-side volume expansion.
3963.72s:  So this so far, this doesn't look good.
3967.32s:  Now just because it landed on this volume node, that starts to look okay.
3972.52s:  I don't love that it closed below the 200-day MA, but the MA's, there's no specific
3978.44s:  magic that happens here.
3981.84s:  And then if we zoom this out to understand broader points of control, most people are making
3986.84s:  a ton of money on this thing.
3988.48s:  So they don't give a shit.
3989.80s:  They're not worried about it dropping from 140 down to 118.
3993.52s:  Most people over the last year got in at 90.
3996.68s:  So they're plenty happy.
3998.20s:  The only people that would be moderately unhappy right now are the people over the last
4001.92s:  three months that have been transacting at 137 and now it's at 116.
4006.40s:  But even those people aren't that upset.
4009.56s:  So the entire concept of waiting for the dust to settle or taking a tactical pause is
4015.96s:  from a trader's lens.
4017.92s:  And that's when we wait and see what does it do here?
4020.48s:  Does it continue?
4021.48s:  Does it consolidate?
4022.48s:  Does it start to go up?
4023.88s:  And then we make a trade decision based off of that.
4026.88s:  But trying to make a directional trade decision off of one big counter-move day is really
4033.00s:  difficult and it's super low probability.
4035.68s:  So that's the general idea.
4037.56s:  Really, really great question.
4038.56s:  I'm glad you asked that one.
4039.76s:  All right, cool.
4040.76s:  We have time for maybe a couple more.
4043.00s:  I know that there was a bunch that was going on today.
4044.92s:  I'm not in a big rush.
4046.44s:  But yeah, so happy to look at a couple more.
4051.00s:  Let's see.
4055.52s:  Travel.
4058.68s:  Travel.
4059.68s:  How the fuck do I say your name?
4062.44s:  By the way.
4064.24s:  Travel, Urzal.
4065.84s:  Use, Urzal.
4067.60s:  That's my best guess.
4068.80s:  Travel, Urzal.
4070.96s:  When it starts going up, how long you wait or what to look at that really recovering?
4076.56s:  Great question.
4077.84s:  So to finish that is, that is good.
4084.36s:  The first one.
4085.36s:  I forgot the first one.
4086.36s:  Travel, Urzal.
4087.68s:  That's my best guess.
4090.20s:  So the way that we can see if this is recovering is if it starts to consolidate.
4094.36s:  If we start to see buy side volume stepping in, if we see continuation of elevated volume
4099.76s:  but prices appreciating, that is really, really positive marks for something that's starting
4107.32s:  to catch its legs.
4109.36s:  So for example, here, this isn't the time to buy from a trader's lens.
4114.16s:  This isn't the time to buy.
4115.24s:  This isn't the time to buy.
4116.36s:  This isn't the time to buy.
4117.44s:  This isn't the time to buy.
4118.84s:  This could be a time to buy.
4121.52s:  And for this one, we wouldn't have gotten stopped out.
4124.32s:  So this entry could have been fine.
4125.96s:  Now, let me take a giant step back, completely armchair quarterbacking.
4132.28s:  We're looking at a previous move.
4134.04s:  But I'm talking to you from the perspective of my general methodology, which is waiting
4139.72s:  for consolidation, which is what this is and then a price breakout of some sort following
4145.68s:  the consolidation.
4147.20s:  Now we want to see buy side volume coming in.
4149.84s:  We want to see price setting in a floor and then staying away from the floor wherever
4154.64s:  that is.
4155.64s:  We want to see accumulation occurring and then we want to see price obviously starting
4159.96s:  to move up.
4161.12s:  Now you can also overlay short term moving averages here, five day, nine day, ten day,
4167.12s:  whatever makes you happy.
4168.12s:  Typically something this short would be better with like a five day and then a midterm
4172.32s:  moving average of 20 days, something like that.
4175.08s:  And I also can use something like a RSI with a seven day VWAP moving average to understand
4181.64s:  what the overall strength of this basing is.
4185.16s:  So for example, as the stock is trending sideways here, if we take a look at the RSI, we
4190.68s:  can actually see that RSI is positive sloping.
4194.72s:  So that's a divergence between the oscillator and the stock price.
4198.76s:  That's typically a clue.
4200.32s:  That doesn't mean that price is going to turn around, but it's a clue.
4203.72s:  So the nature of the game in terms of this timing component is our job as traders is to
4208.52s:  apply our skill set.
4209.92s:  And then in this case, the skill set is technical analysis to identify what we think is most
4215.16s:  likely to occur.
4216.44s:  Now you can apply a even simpler analysis and just use options pricing and option pricing
4221.88s:  captures a lot of it.
4223.52s:  But that's the general overview of how to see something that's basing.
4233.12s:  And then in the process of recovery before entry, another good question.
4239.88s:  Why not ask to look at so far in Christian as first to look at Tesla.
4248.12s:  So let's take a look at Tesla.
4254.48s:  Resilient today.
4257.36s:  It has earnings coming up on the 29th.
4261.76s:  Let's see how it's positioned for earnings.
4264.20s:  And then let's grab O rats to look at prior earnings, 3 mil against 2.7.
4272.48s:  So people are pretty bullish in Tesla.
4282.32s:  Let's do.
4288.84s:  So from an earnings lens, it essentially is never within the move.
4300.84s:  This actually would be great for a long straddle, to be honest, a little bit late.
4305.12s:  But this is one that I actually would trade a long straddle in pretty happily.
4311.88s:  And what I'm referring to for those that don't know is this.
4314.84s:  I'm essentially analyzing, this is looking at the last 12 moves, but something like this
4321.28s:  will also give you the same information key, where we can see the move expectation post
4330.96s:  earnings release.
4333.20s:  And then we can see obviously the overall stock price movement.
4337.00s:  So the vast majority of these post release, we can see that.
4342.04s:  I mean, the majority of them implied false short.
4350.48s:  So yeah, this would be a pretty easy long straddle style position for earnings itself.
4359.12s:  Let's take a look at how it's positioned for earnings itself, which is just this week.
4363.84s:  We can get rid of all this other stuff.
4367.00s:  Three 16 on the call side against 257 on the puts.
4370.60s:  So people definitely are favoring the call side.
4373.72s:  And let's take a look at the wall surface.
4379.36s:  No surprise favoring the put side, which is pretty standard.
4386.24s:  We can see a couple kinks a little further out.
4390.88s:  But mostly pricing downside, which I don't think in this case actually means downside.
4394.80s:  I think that's more just standard.
4397.32s:  Vault positioning leading leading into the earnings release.
4401.96s:  So for earnings, it looks like people are positioned moderately bullish.
4406.12s:  Vault favors the downside a little bit, pretty standard fare for something like this.
4409.68s:  I can tell you what the event wall itself is.
4413.84s:  Give me one sec.
4414.84s:  I have a calculator for this.
4417.28s:  So the stock price is 39715.
4421.60s:  The event experee vol is 112.89.
4427.40s:  The ticker vol itself is 68.63.
4433.80s:  68.
4434.88s:  I don't know why I said 63.
4438.36s:  I'm in it.
4439.36s:  It's 68.3.
4442.88s:  And this expression right now is four.
4445.96s:  So this is looking at like a 9.7% expected move in terms of the straddle that puts it
4454.28s:  out of 38.5 point move.
4457.92s:  The event wall itself is like 192%.
4461.08s:  So the event the event volatility is huge on this one, which is fully to be expected.
4469.28s:  Let's take a look at it from a longer term perspective, which looks good.
4475.36s:  From a longer term perspective, it looks good.
4477.96s:  I don't like this near term price movement on this short term time frame like this doesn't
4482.52s:  look great.
4484.52s:  Like I don't love that and it definitely looks like it's generally.
4496.64s:  Unfortunately following that, which is rolling over a little bit.
4503.64s:  Obviously it broke out to the downside here.
4509.40s:  So now for this, it looks more so like how does it behave against that is the next question
4518.12s:  for me.
4519.68s:  It's sitting on a small volume node right here.
4523.64s:  So there are people interested in transacting here.
4526.52s:  So near term price expectation for me would be to probably oscillate sideways into earnings
4531.08s:  and then if it has a good earnings, I actually expect another round of post earnings announcement
4535.12s:  drift.
4538.00s:  That was a position that I traded actually on the last earnings release here because
4543.84s:  of how strong of a gap up it had post earnings.
4547.80s:  So yeah, that's a overview at least of what Tesla looks like.
4555.84s:  Big A says I was thinking higher IV would make the premium cost more and if you wanted
4560.16s:  for cheaper long options, you could buy more my mistake.
4564.36s:  Let me get caught up here.
4566.36s:  What big A's?
4572.16s:  What are you referring to here?
4577.88s:  You lose the bottom tick but once it settles the IV should be lower or going for long encounter
4583.10s:  against any lost gains.
4589.30s:  Are you talking still about Nvidia?
4597.82s:  And are you talking about the concept of waiting and the impact volatility?
4604.50s:  I'm just trying to piece together.
4610.42s:  I'm piece together where we're at.
4616.42s:  Correct.
4618.86s:  I was replying to recent yes, waiting to buy it.
4621.62s:  I see.
4622.62s:  And what are you talking about with respect to the volatility here?
4628.22s:  Are you saying like one of the main reasons to wait to buy is because the volatility would
4632.78s:  be higher and waiting for the volatility to contract or something else because if that's
4639.86s:  what you're saying, I actually would disagree with that and I can show you why.
4655.86s:  Because RIS says high IV just means people are expecting it to move which is a bad thing.
4661.06s:  So RIS, that angle is correct.
4663.46s:  One guiding feature on it though is that when IV is high, that means that you are absolutely
4669.18s:  paying more for it.
4670.94s:  So then if IV does contract, it can impact your position.
4675.50s:  It means that you have to be directionally correct.
4678.22s:  You're waiting being directionally correct more so.
4682.62s:  Big A says yeah, I thought if you waited the volatility would contract so I guess I'm
4686.06s:  wrong.
4687.06s:  No, that's not wrong.
4687.74s:  If you wait the volatility likely would contract, but at least from the lens that I was talking
4693.66s:  about buying potentially for the example of buying options here is that just wouldn't
4699.30s:  be like a major input into the decision is all.
4703.38s:  But the assumption of if you hold off, volatility would probably calm down a little bit.
4709.02s:  I actually think that that's completely fine.
4710.90s:  That's correct.
4713.42s:  That volatility, it doesn't matter that much and I'll show you why for two reasons.
4720.50s:  The first one is if you look in the near term volatility for Nvidia right now, it's
4725.10s:  at 112%.
4726.42s:  For a lot of the conversations that we would have here in terms of buying volatility,
4731.38s:  most people at least understand my approach to buying premium which would have us go
4736.58s:  out at the very least 60 days.
4739.42s:  So that would put us in the 17 April at the earliest.
4742.18s:  What do you notice about the 17 April vol compared to this near term vol?
4747.98s:  The 17 April vol is 62%.
4751.10s:  It's already much lower than all this front vol.
4753.66s:  It's because it's further out in time.
4755.50s:  So even though Vega can have a decent impact here because you're going further out in time
4762.30s:  and because as of right now, it looks like more of a near term move, the volatility here
4767.02s:  still to be very clear would be impacted, but it's not as much as this front vol.
4773.18s:  So to your broader point, if in video, let's just say in video, started trending sideways,
4777.74s:  you will notice that these two vols, well, three vols specifically, explorations would
4782.34s:  probably contract a lot.
4784.62s:  You won't see this one contract as much.
4787.18s:  You'll still see a contract, but not as much.
4790.14s:  And you can get a sense of what nominal vol typically is, which is about 56%.
4795.10s:  So if we're looking at these 80s, the nominal vol typically is 56%.
4800.10s:  This is at 62%.
4802.42s:  So you can see that you're looking at maybe like a 6% overall change in vol, which if
4806.90s:  you get the direction correct, that will overwhelm that change in vol every day of the week.
4812.02s:  So that's a really good inference that you're seeing.
4817.54s:  And I hope that looking at that helps connect a couple more dots on making like that kind
4824.02s:  of decision, because what you're talking about there is correct.
4828.94s:  But I would consider that level of analysis, kind of like late stage beginner analysis,
4834.82s:  because you're taught that if volatility or if stock price starts to flatten out, that
4840.02s:  volatility will contract, which is not wrong.
4843.34s:  But to take that thought process one step further, we want to think more so about the
4848.78s:  volatility surface and nominal volatility relative to terms.
4854.34s:  That's the next step.
4855.46s:  So hopefully that helps you with that process a little bit.
4858.06s:  But yeah, no, you're looking at the exact right stuff that's completely okay.
4862.62s:  Sweet.
4863.62s:  All right, gang, that's it for me.
4864.74s:  If you need anything, hit me up in the discord pro livestream tomorrow at 1700 Pacific
4868.74s:  time, be an LR.
4869.74s:  See you all later.
