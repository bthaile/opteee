0.72s: what's up everybody eric here with a
2.32s: video on how to use linear regression
4.56s: channels in your trading we're going to
6.16s: cover two things the first one is what
8.32s: are linear regression channels and
10.00s: really why i like them and then the
11.76s: second thing is how can we use them to
13.68s: trade now a lot of people at different
16.16s: points will have heard of things like
17.84s: standard deviation channels linear
20.00s: regression channels are different from
22.16s: standard deviation channels and we will
24.24s: explain how so let's start off with what
27.36s: linear regression channels are they are
30.56s: a price analysis tool
33.60s: and we typically use it to identify
36.16s: prevailing trends as well as extremes
39.84s: now there's two main components when
41.60s: we're talking about linear regression
42.96s: channels we're gonna have the line of
44.56s: best fit and then we're gonna have the
46.80s: channels themselves so let's take a
49.20s: quick look at what this looks like
51.36s: don't mind the rest of the noise on the
54.00s: chart i want you to focus on two things
56.08s: the first one is this purple
58.72s: trend line and then these dashed yellow
62.40s: linear regression channels notice one's
64.48s: a little
65.44s: bolder than the other one this is a 100
68.56s: linear regression channel and then this
69.84s: is a 50
71.28s: so what is a linear regression channel
74.16s: what it's doing is it uses whatever
76.48s: aggregation period that you're looking
78.32s: at so right now we're looking at a six
79.68s: month daily
81.12s: if i change this to a one year day
83.52s: notice how the linear regression itself
85.84s: changes what it's doing is it's creating
88.64s: a line of best fit which is this purple
91.60s: line that you see kind of that goes
93.44s: straight through the most of the data
94.88s: points it's exactly what it is it's just
96.88s: the statistical measure of each data
99.36s: point in the aggregation period and it
101.44s: creates a line of best fit for that
103.60s: then these dashed lines are built by
106.80s: using the price extremes within that
108.88s: aggregation period so notice at the 100
112.48s: percent we see a touch up here at that
115.68s: level and then we also see price kind of
117.60s: touching below this level
120.08s: what this is doing it's taking instead
122.40s: of standard deviation channels which
124.96s: also uses a line of best fit but then it
127.12s: just plots standard deviations off of
130.48s: that line of best fit the difference is
133.52s: linear regression channels uses the
135.60s: price extremes to create the bands
139.28s: so a 100 linear regression channel is
141.92s: going to be out at the most extreme
144.08s: prices during that data set
146.88s: again in this case now it's a one year
148.96s: daily
150.24s: and then the 50 is going to be half of
152.40s: that move
153.44s: off of the line of best fit so the
155.44s: reason why i really like linear
156.72s: regression channels is it's using the
159.76s: current data from the chart as a measure
162.64s: of price and giving you both trend and
166.32s: identification of extremes during that
168.24s: point similar to standard deviation
170.56s: channels we would expect to see in this
173.28s: case a hundred percent of data between
176.08s: the 100 level right because it's saying
178.80s: that we're gonna have the largest move
181.60s: is 100 that's the widest this band can
184.40s: go so as we get moves bigger than that
187.52s: this 100 band will move
190.00s: so the real utility though
192.88s: is just like any other statistical
194.96s: measure if you'll notice once we start
198.40s: hitting up near i always refer to it as
200.24s: a plus 2 standard deviation linear
202.48s: regression it's technically incorrect
205.12s: it's very close to that again because
207.60s: right now 100 of data falls between this
210.80s: as compared to you know 95 which falls
213.36s: between plus one minus two standard
214.80s: deviations so even the stats you know
218.48s: undergrad side of me gets a little
220.08s: peeved at that but it's just more
221.84s: efficient so in this case i'll refer to
224.48s: these as a plus two uh minus two linear
227.28s: regression channels or really you could
229.04s: call it plus three minus three which is
230.88s: 99.7 percent but the main point really
234.16s: is when we're looking at price the vast
236.48s: majority of price is going to fall
238.00s: within these two bands you will see
239.52s: things poke through it and again that's
241.76s: because it's based off of the
242.88s: aggregation period and that is why i
245.68s: don't say 100 percent falls within
248.80s: because
249.76s: even though you'll notice that there's
251.52s: nothing really closing below these bands
254.56s: they can still exceed it during intraday
256.96s: so again that's due to the aggregation
258.64s: period
259.84s: all right so let's talk about how we can
262.64s: use them to trade well i already told
264.88s: you let's start with kind of broader
266.72s: picture and zoom our way in broader
268.80s: picture trend analysis so this line of
271.52s: best fit is really useful because it's
273.92s: giving you the prevailing trend for the
276.80s: data set that you're looking at so when
278.80s: we're looking at iwm on a one year daily
281.92s: our trend line is decreasing it means
284.56s: that
285.28s: overall average price as right now is
288.16s: declining it's not growing it's
289.84s: declining
291.04s: so you can use this to get just general
293.68s: market sentiment that way the other
296.08s: thing you can do is when we're looking
298.24s: at trend analysis i like to use
299.84s: different time frames so a lot of times
301.92s: i'll use something that's really long
303.84s: start with like a three year or a five
305.44s: year and this gives me broad context
308.24s: about whatever i'm looking at again this
310.48s: case it's you know iwm
312.64s: so we can see that back in uh march of
317.76s: 21 during the covet drop we were down at
320.40s: this minus two linear regression channel
323.12s: again we have holes poking below it
324.88s: which would uh indicate intraday moves
327.28s: below those levels
328.96s: but since then we've then rebounded to
331.44s: this 50 level
333.52s: and we're back down towards the minus 50
337.52s: or again i like to use minus one uh
340.32s: linear regression channel so in this
342.56s: case we again expect to see
345.44s: 95 or 100 percent of data that closes
348.72s: within this but 95 of data should fall
351.92s: within this again that includes these
353.68s: tails and then for the plus one minus
356.48s: one we would expect to see 68 of data so
359.20s: the majority which is pretty much the
361.52s: case is what you're seeing here
363.44s: so
364.56s: right now on a long-term trend it looks
368.40s: like we could be flirting with some
370.80s: support at this level again i don't
373.68s: necessarily use these as
375.84s: strong supportive resistance i prefer to
378.00s: use things like the volume profile
379.84s: moving averages but really what i'm
381.92s: looking at is how is it reacting to some
383.60s: of these levels and then like in this
385.20s: case we're seeing higher lows higher
387.44s: highs we are seeing a little bit of a
388.96s: pullback right now obviously need to
390.40s: monitor that but
392.24s: on a long-term trend it looks like we
395.52s: are growing then i'll move into a year
398.32s: day and again we already went over this
400.08s: one
401.04s: we see that we're actually flirting with
402.56s: this minus two linear regression channel
405.28s: and bouncing up out of it typically when
407.52s: i see things at plus two minus two
409.76s: linear regression channels that's an
411.68s: extreme we can typically start to at
414.64s: least explore a contrarian trade idea in
418.56s: these instances because it's a
420.64s: statistical measure so we don't expect
423.76s: to see it going into perpetuity data to
427.20s: bundle at these extremes so when we see
429.44s: it we can look to take a contrarian
431.84s: trade there maybe when it hit this high
434.40s: of plus two linear regression we could
435.92s: have faded it and then the inverse could
438.24s: be true for the minus two there's
440.16s: nothing that says that it can't stay
441.84s: down here for a bit but again it would
444.96s: need
445.76s: a ton of volume and suppression or
449.44s: support to remain elevated at either
452.64s: extreme
453.60s: so a lot of times what i like to do is
455.76s: once i see something starting to break
457.68s: out of the plus one or minus one this is
460.56s: an opportunity again for a reversal play
463.76s: or if you see what you saw in iwm here
466.32s: where we blew through it
468.64s: then maybe there's a continuation to the
470.64s: downside that you can trade
472.48s: so when i'm using these longer term
475.12s: linear regression channels i'm really
476.72s: just gaining context
478.48s: of where price is in its history and
482.32s: then how it's kind of reacting to itself
484.48s: then as we zoom in closer to the windows
487.28s: that we're looking to trade is where it
488.64s: gets more interesting so for
490.84s: example we're now at a six month daily
493.44s: if i'm going to sell puts in iwm i like
495.68s: the six month and the three month so
497.52s: looking at the six month we're in a
499.04s: pretty strong decline again just
500.96s: indicated by this purple trend line
503.12s: across the chart the other thing that i
505.36s: see is notice how we started trying to
508.32s: move through
509.60s: this upper linear regression channel
511.76s: over here but down here we're just kind
514.00s: of lightly flirting with it to me a lot
516.40s: of times this could show that we really
519.28s: haven't bottomed out in terms of
521.04s: downside move again this isn't my
523.20s: favorite for support and resistance but
524.96s: it gives me some ideas in terms of where
526.96s: price is moving around
529.12s: so the thing that i like to watch here
531.20s: is very stereotypical higher highs
533.52s: higher lows and we can see that we kind
535.68s: of we're struggling right here and this
538.16s: typically is not a great signal so
541.52s: in conjunction with linear regression
543.52s: channels i can use small little trends
546.16s: like this
547.84s: price lines like this to get an idea of
549.68s: where prevailing trend is going but
551.28s: overall six months prevailing trend is
553.60s: down easy to see clear as day
555.92s: so in this case if i was looking for a
557.44s: prospective trade i might look to see
560.00s: how it reacts to this minus one if i'm
562.72s: interested in trying to get long iwm if
565.28s: i see it blow through this minus one
567.52s: there's a good chance that i you know
569.76s: could take a look at a short position in
572.32s: iwm
573.52s: so i think the true power of linear
575.68s: aggression channels lies in the
577.84s: identification of price extremes
580.24s: specifically if we're looking to trade
582.24s: shorter term time frames if we're
584.00s: looking to trade longer term time frames
586.00s: it's still really useful for overall
588.16s: trend analysis to get an idea of okay so
590.80s: for this is a two-year
592.88s: daily chart and we can see that we are
595.12s: really at an extreme to the downside so
598.96s: overall long term
601.28s: price would naturally want to gravitate
604.00s: at least closer to this trend line now
605.92s: two things would happen as new data
608.16s: points are added this trend line will
610.88s: start to assume
612.56s: the new average integrating those new
614.48s: data points but again this is using a
617.68s: lot of data so we know that the line of
621.20s: best fit at least has a lot of volume
624.40s: and price traded there that's where it's
626.32s: created from
627.60s: so
628.48s: i think using linear regression channels
631.04s: is a awesome tool it can be very
635.36s: enlightening in terms of prevailing
637.04s: trends and then we can also use it for
638.96s: some shorter term identification of
642.64s: price extremes so
644.48s: if there's any questions let me know and
646.96s: as always if there's any content that
648.88s: you want to see me do a video on throw
650.64s: it into me i love making videos on what
652.48s: you all want to see you can use any of
654.24s: my contact info in the video description
655.76s: below and i'll catch y'all later
