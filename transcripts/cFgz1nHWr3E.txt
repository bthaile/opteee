0.00s: Edge in options trading or trading in general looks completely different than probably the
5.80s: overwhelming majority of you understand.
8.50s: And the goal of this video is to clear that up.
12.00s: There's nothing that complicated about what we're going to talk about.
15.20s: It's just discussed in a way that you're not used to probably hearing it because I want
21.20s: to talk about three things.
23.00s: I want to talk about what edge isn't what it is.
25.80s: And then at the end of the video, I'm literally going to give you a step by step guide
31.00s: on how to clearly find the fine and then capitalize on sources of edge.
39.88s: Let's start with what edge isn't.
42.64s: And if we go to one of our favorite places on Reddit and we, this is super old for me years
48.40s: ago, but it says, where is the edge?
50.80s: You will see places like this or this person that says, tasty trade is that IV is overstated
57.24s: compared to realizable.
59.44s: This is actually a completely viable source of edge.
62.44s: It's just, it just doesn't work the way that people think it does, which we'll talk about.
66.48s: This says your edge isn't management.
68.56s: This is completely incorrect and you'll see why.
72.28s: This one is saying that feels like the easy money is gone, which is also wrong.
76.88s: The fact of the matter is that you're going to find a ton of terrible information about
81.08s: edge.
82.08s: So, first things first, options are not edge.
85.44s: They are simply an asset class.
87.96s: The way to think about this concept of edge is it flows a lot differently than what you
95.80s: think because people think that options are complex.
99.16s: So if I learn options, I now have an edge.
101.40s: The reality is there's plenty of people that are willing to put in the work to learn about
105.88s: options.
106.72s: Therefore, there is no edge there.
109.24s: It's simply a way to capitalize on what an edge might be.
114.20s: Another is the DeltaU select, the Day's to expiration.
118.68s: Theta itself, different options structures like strangles, verticals, iron condors, literally
125.24s: none of those are edge.
127.24s: There are just decisions about how you're looking to place a trade ideally to capitalize
131.48s: on an edge.
132.64s: But not edges in and of themselves.
135.84s: Or indicator settings, whether you use 1226 or 1326 on your Mac D is not an edge.
145.84s: Those are signals defined by whatever methodology you're using that might help you identify
153.84s: or extract or maximize an edge.
157.28s: But they don't provide an edge in and of itself.
160.08s: Selling premium is not an edge.
162.64s: If there was a straight up edge in selling premium, everybody would do it.
167.52s: But there's a reason why they don't.
169.96s: And it's because selling premium can capture an edge, but it's not inherently an edge itself.
177.32s: We already talked about this idea of understanding options, not being an edge.
182.72s: It's just what you need to do in order to play the game.
186.80s: Risk management is we talked about.
188.72s: It doesn't create an edge.
190.00s: I can manage my risk very, very carefully.
193.56s: And that doesn't mean I'm going to have any sort of positive return.
196.44s: It just means that I'm going to have good risk management.
198.92s: You have to have good risk management.
201.12s: But you also have to have an edge.
204.12s: Risk management does an equal edge.
206.28s: It allows you enough grace and robustness in your portfolio to attempt to extract an edge.
215.60s: Not one itself being consistently profitable is not inherently an edge.
222.92s: You can have very high win rate strategies that actually lose money.
229.84s: I'll show you.
231.48s: Let's take a look at a hypothetical trading system that wins 90% of the time.
237.76s: If your average win is 200 bucks, high probability, really, really high probability of making
244.00s: 200 bucks.
245.56s: And over the lifespan of your strategy, 10% very infrequent.
250.12s: So if we're using 50 trades, 5 trades lose $2,000.
255.24s: It's the tail risk.
256.68s: This is if you're selling super far out of the money options every once in a while, you're
260.52s: going to get a big move.
261.52s: We could take a look real quick at what that might look like.
264.68s: If we look at selling a 37 days text operation, put in spy.
270.76s: That takes us out right now to the 628.
274.72s: If we analyze the PNL here, we're looking to make 236 bucks.
279.76s: So what's the equivalent of this scenario?
282.64s: This has about a 90% probability of winning.
286.40s: But you can tell that this is a 10x loss, we're on average making 200, losing 2 grand.
291.32s: So the question is, where do we lose 2 grand here?
293.92s: Well, if we eyeball it, we lose 2 grand at 61587.
302.28s: That represents less than a 10% decline in S&P.
307.88s: So is that 10% decline exceedingly probable though?
313.32s: But is it possible that that happens over 10% of the lifespan of selling these?
320.28s: Actually, it largely will depend on the path, how do things happen to unfold?
326.04s: But the point is that this is, you don't need the world ending or some sort of crazy
330.32s: unlikely scenario.
331.32s: Literally just needs to drop 10%.
334.24s: Over the course of these 39 trading days, that's completely realistic.
338.96s: That's the point here when we're looking at consistently profitable or high win rate strategies.
344.44s: That's not inherently an edge.
346.32s: So what I'm highlighting here is that very frequently, options traders look at this equation
351.92s: from the exact wrong lens.
355.68s: We start backwards.
357.48s: We start with options, then we start trying to figure out where we're going to trade
361.60s: the vertical spread or what options we want to trade the wheel in or other versions or
368.24s: what underlines we want to trade the wheel in and other versions of that.
372.80s: And the issue is it's completely backwards.
376.00s: Let's talk about getting this oriented correctly.
380.44s: Edge simply put is positive expected return.
384.88s: It doesn't necessarily mean that you outperform the market.
387.88s: That's alpha.
389.32s: But it means that whatever you're doing in the long run makes money.
394.76s: Now if we think about different ways to make money, we have to start with an effect.
402.64s: The way to think about a market effect is something that happens either structurally,
410.60s: gave you really, but something that occurs that you see, you can identify and you can find
418.36s: a way to trade it successfully.
419.80s: Let's talk about a source of edge that you all know.
424.24s: If I go to this chart and spy and I zoom out over a really, really long timeframe, this
429.20s: is effectively going back to 1995.
432.68s: One of the things that I notice is that S&P 500 tends to go up over time.
440.44s: This is called drift.
443.04s: The market drifts up over the long run.
446.08s: That's an edge.
447.08s: That is a way to make money.
448.24s: This is positively expected right from the jump.
450.68s: There's your first edge for free.
452.68s: You can take action on that immediately if you so choose.
457.24s: The issue is in general, edge is way more abundant than people think, but it's way less
464.16s: profound than people think.
467.20s: More often than not, an edge like this is not lambo in two weeks kind of money.
474.48s: This is your money doubling every seven years, but if you're starting with five grand,
480.16s: your money doubling every seven years isn't necessarily that inspiring.
484.88s: That's why the concept of saving is so important and why consistency is so important.
492.24s: Because if you can do those and you can amplify the market return slightly, all the
497.00s: people are starting to realize that you're not going to have a lot of money.
500.32s: For those that don't know, I started with a tiny account.
503.20s: I grew up relatively poor, but I really focused on saving.
507.16s: That's exactly how I hit my first million before I was 30.
511.16s: I was not on some sort of profound roadmap to do that.
514.16s: I didn't get into some sort of crazy, lucrative career.
517.36s: I was a marine officer, which is awesome, but you make good money, but you're not making
521.04s: that much money.
522.04s: It's because of these principles that I'm explaining to you.
526.12s: So we now know what edge isn't, we know what edge is.
530.04s: Let's talk about where we can find edge, and then I'm going to give you literally a step
533.72s: by step guide.
535.44s: Real sources of edge exist in market effects.
538.76s: Market effects that we can make money from, I refer to as profit mechanisms.
544.40s: The reason for this is there are plenty of market effects that we cannot monetize, but
549.96s: they're still there, but they're just not reachable due to things like friction.
554.48s: The cost of doing business costs to carry stuff like that.
558.64s: So one of the ways that we can create true edge through stuff like indexed additions and
565.76s: deletions.
566.76s: There's a phenomenon that as a company gets added to an index, it tends to experience positive
572.08s: flow.
573.08s: We can rationally logically pursue this, because if something is in an index, it's
579.24s: going to naturally have more capital flowing into it.
583.28s: What does that mean?
584.64s: The market at a base effect operates on supply and demand.
590.00s: If there is enough demand, that's going to push price up.
595.00s: So being added to an index typically does that, same to the inverse for deletions.
601.76s: If something is removed from an index, typically goes down.
605.68s: Next, rebalancing flows.
608.16s: We know that periodically indices need to get back to their target balance.
613.60s: That causes artificial price movement.
617.28s: But what's the cool part?
618.28s: The cool part is, is we know when they're rebalancing.
621.04s: Now the market knows this as well.
622.56s: It's not free money that's just sitting there in mass.
625.60s: A lot of times people will try to front run the move.
628.40s: That causes earlier moves that can become dislocated from the rebalancing.
632.60s: But we know the rebalancing effect exists.
635.16s: Next, end of month window dressing.
637.52s: This is something that's really, really common where different kind of funds towards the end
641.68s: of the month, they sell off their risky stuff.
644.48s: And then they buy into more common or more mainstream stuff so that when they send their
649.40s: statements out, they can say, yeah, we're holding the same stuff everybody else is.
653.64s: That causes a really easily tradable phenomenon that typically towards the end of the month,
658.96s: the S&P 500, for example, drifts up.
661.44s: Not every single month.
662.44s: It's not always going to be the case.
664.04s: But again, positive expectancy over the long run, that's another effect that you literally
670.52s: can execute on right now.
673.20s: What's another one, index putt skew.
675.24s: This is the tendency for puts to be priced more expensive than the relative out of the
683.00s: money calls.
684.00s: Let's take a look at an example.
685.00s: I haven't prep this.
686.00s: So we'll see if it's holding true right now.
688.68s: The six, 68 puts, these are a, well, it's use these, the six, 67's because these are actually
694.88s: a 30 delta.
696.16s: The 30 delta puts are trading for, let's call it $7.14 with a volume of 1710.
703.80s: Let's go to a 30 delta call.
705.84s: The 30 delta call is only 13.4% volt and it's literally like $2 cheaper.
712.96s: That's putt skew.
714.28s: The market prices puts more rich than calls in things like indices specifically, but
720.36s: other names as well, because people are willing to overpay for downside protection.
725.88s: For somebody else to take the downside risk for them.
729.00s: This is an edge.
730.00s: Again, it's not always an edge.
732.00s: If you just blindly sell puts all the time, that's not necessarily going to net out
736.80s: again, depending on how the market's doing.
739.16s: That's one of the most common issues when people are trying to find an edge is they're trying
742.72s: to find something that they could just always do.
746.00s: And there are regimes where certain edges are favorable to others.
751.96s: But understanding where the edges are and what they are is a super important starting point.
757.52s: Next, the fact that typically speaking, we see implied volatility elevated through earnings
765.08s: releases.
766.48s: What does that mean?
767.48s: Well, all of all, typically you're selling more expensive,
770.60s: involved than what's realized.
772.76s: Again, another piece of edge that can be executed right now.
778.40s: Last, information indiscreteness.
781.80s: This means that with different issues, meaning securities, that are less covered, less
789.68s: analyst reporting on it, less focus on the news, it takes longer for information to
796.20s: be integrated into the price that leads to things like price direction opportunities, momentum.
804.88s: We can see this through things like post earnings announcement drift, another actionable
809.84s: source of edge available to you right now.
813.56s: Let's talk about this process on how to actually do this.
820.32s: The first thing.
822.52s: And enough, I would avoid YouTube altogether.
825.88s: The reason why I would avoid YouTube for sources of edge is because everything will sound
831.80s: good, right?
832.80s: So for example, as I talk about that earnings effect, it sounds good.
837.40s: But the reality is, if you execute it, you're going to go through some bad times because
842.64s: it works out in the aggregate.
844.36s: That means you can have some really big losses.
847.52s: But if somebody's just talking about it in a video, you see the aggregate results, it
852.56s: automatically looks good.
854.72s: That will confuse you.
856.68s: That doesn't mean don't use the internet, do.
859.60s: But save searching for edge for later, and I'll give you other ways to find it first,
865.12s: which is go to SSRN.
867.72s: The social, science, research network.
869.96s: I'm not affiliated with them at all.
872.08s: You can create a free account, and you can just search for things.
876.40s: This gives you access to literally thousands of peer reviewed research.
882.20s: And what do we look for?
884.60s: We just look for stuff.
886.00s: We type in the word stock market.
887.64s: We type in various risk premiums.
889.44s: If you're familiar with my work in the channel, you will come across this term.
892.88s: We look for value stocks, growth stocks, momentum, alpha, edge, stock market effects, et cetera, et cetera.
898.64s: And to give you an example of what this looks like, if I go to stock market edge, I see
902.12s: this thing right here.
903.12s: So, we have a stock market in no dividend stocks.
907.04s: Okay, it has thousand downloads.
909.20s: That's relatively a lot for something like this.
911.12s: Let's see what it says.
912.72s: We develop a model of aggregate stock market featuring both dividend and nonpaying dividend
918.72s: stocks within the familiar, equal of your own base framework.
924.36s: So, familiar buckets.
926.08s: We find that such a simple feature leads to profound implications supporting several stock,
931.60s: and empirical regularities that leading consumption-based asset pricing models have difficulty
937.40s: reconciling.
938.40s: This is all just fancy research-based jargon because a lot of researchers, they're essentially
943.84s: trying to explain relationships against the efficient market hypothesis.
949.00s: That said, it's important to take what you read here in context.
953.64s: So let's see what they find.
956.00s: They find that we show that the presence of no dividend stocks in the market leads to
960.80s: lower correlation between stock market return and aggregate consumption growth.
965.80s: When we quantify these effects, we find them to be economically significant.
971.04s: This means that there's some sort of value there.
973.36s: We find that no dividend stocks command lower mean returns, but have higher return
980.12s: volatility in higher market betas than comparable dividend paying stocks consistent with
985.72s: empirical evidence.
987.36s: This, again, is giving you a direct place that you can start to research.
991.92s: Another example here is one important caveat is you want to focus on US stock market effects.
999.08s: If you don't look at US stock market effects, they'll look at the Chinese stock market,
1004.08s: Taiwanese stock market, these different Indian stock market.
1007.88s: And those effects won't pull over as nicely to the US stock market.
1011.56s: That doesn't mean don't look there.
1012.80s: You should look there eventually, but I would start with what's most relevant.
1016.88s: And if you do this, you'll come across stuff like this, the Halloween effect.
1021.24s: You'll come across very insurice premium.
1023.88s: You'll come across different market effects that you can literally turn into profit mechanisms.
1030.80s: So as you're conducting this research, create a trading plan.
1034.76s: In that trading plan, you're going to take notes.
1037.88s: You're going to focus on the most recent and most downloaded papers.
1041.92s: From there, you want to actually add details for you to follow up on and explore more
1047.92s: deeply.
1048.92s: So think about creating just a quick description of the profit mechanism, the behavior that
1055.32s: it exhibits.
1056.60s: What impacts it has.
1058.00s: What the frequency is.
1059.16s: So again, for example, with the Halloween effect, we can answer all of those questions
1064.60s: by reading this paper.
1067.00s: And then that leads to your next step, which is open up a Google sheet called a trade
1072.88s: log and as you outline this effect, try to track it.
1077.88s: Notice none of this has anything to do with options.
1080.36s: You don't even have to worry about options yet.
1082.52s: If you want to measure the Halloween effect, maybe you look at the index pricing around
1088.20s: the bounds that it gives you.
1090.00s: And you just measure how does this behave over the defined period?
1095.36s: That's a good starting point.
1096.88s: Now with this, we want to be able to do things like backtest, forward test and live
1103.76s: test.
1105.24s: That all will be covered if you're interested in another video.
1110.20s: But the important thing to note here is that if you want to backtest something like
1114.28s: that, you could just eyeball it.
1115.76s: Take a look at what this thing tells you.
1117.88s: And then go find it.
1118.88s: Prior Halloween's in the stock market and see what happened.
1122.20s: Measure it.
1123.20s: Measure the window that it gives you at the beginning of October, what's the S&P 500?
1127.92s: At the end of October, what's the S&P 500?
1130.72s: Take a look at that across multi-year periods.
1133.88s: See what you see.
1136.20s: You might come across something interesting.
1139.52s: From here, as you're outlining your profit mechanisms avoiding YouTube in all those places,
1146.16s: you should be really building out your fundamental understanding of options.
1151.44s: Every place do that is through options as a strategic investment by Larry McMillan,
1156.64s: any work by Nate and Berg specifically option volatility and pricing.
1160.84s: Anything by you and some Claire, all of those will help you build your understanding of
1165.16s: options because how do options fit into this?
1168.16s: Well, if we understand that there's some sort of price opportunity in the Halloween effect,
1173.44s: rather than just buying shares, maybe we can use options to gain leverage.
1177.76s: Or when we're trading stuff like variance risk premiums, you can't trade that with
1181.52s: equities.
1182.52s: Options give you access to this edge.
1185.60s: So you need to understand options in depth so that you can then use them properly
1190.24s: to maximize your potential.
1193.52s: Once you have this understanding, then you can go into the deeper layer of research.
1200.28s: This is again, back testing, forward testing, live testing, so that you can quantify things.
1206.08s: Coming from here is when you actually start building strategies.
1210.24s: I have a video called the Outlier Strategy process.
1213.72s: It gives you the exact framework to leverage to take the information that you just learned
1218.56s: which is baked into this process and then to action on it.
1224.24s: This is the exact kind of process that we work on in the Outlier Pro community because
1229.20s: this is the fundamentals of trading that for whatever reason nobody talks about.
1233.28s: It's because it's the work side of the equation.
1236.28s: And this does take some effort, but the cool part is you genuinely can make a lot of
1241.68s: money doing this if you do a good job.
1245.68s: Be an Outlier.
1246.68s: It's Billiter.
