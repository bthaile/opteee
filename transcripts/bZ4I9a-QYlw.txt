0.00s: What's up, outliers?
1.72s: Quick market update for you before the surprise live stream.
6.84s: Later today, 5 p.m. Pacific time.
8.68s: We were getting out there and back at it.
11.08s: So taking a quick look at the market today,
12.88s: it was a little bit of a follow through day.
14.52s: That's mostly what I saw,
15.92s: which I thought was kind of interesting,
18.04s: but we are still seeing a pretty big divergence at this point
22.12s: between large cap and small cap.
24.88s: So when I look at the cues and I look at spy,
27.60s: you can see that they both had really big green days today.
30.80s: Essentially the overwhelming majority of volume
32.84s: was by volume and it's just kind of this
35.00s: almost parabolic recovery up and out.
37.36s: Whereas when I'm looking at IWM,
39.00s: it's still recovering,
40.12s: but it's not really moving anywhere near the same degree
44.00s: as where we're at in these others.
46.08s: And again, like a quick reference for that
47.80s: is take a look at where they're closing in on pre-drop
51.48s: from the first and then the second.
54.68s: So over the first and the second on spy and cues,
57.72s: it's already capturing most of that move back
61.04s: and it's closing in on where it was at on the first.
63.52s: That is not the case for small caps.
65.92s: We're not even halfway.
67.32s: I find that really, really interesting
69.48s: because the market so far has continued to be
72.68s: what I consider to be fairly erratic
75.32s: and really, really sensitive to movements.
78.52s: And what's even most interesting still
81.52s: is the timing of this has become very curious
83.80s: because the probability of a rate cut,
87.08s: if I grab the FedWatch tool for us
89.08s: to take a quick look at together,
90.56s: the probability of a rate cut still is pegged
93.20s: at essentially 100%.
94.64s: So here you go, you could take a look here.
97.64s: I guess I got to move it over to this side.
98.92s: I got to get used to that now.
100.48s: I'm still used to being on the other side.
103.00s: But you can see the probability of a rate cut here.
106.36s: So if we poke through this quickly,
108.28s: we can see if we look at the probabilities here,
111.08s: it's now teetering back to a half point cut.
115.60s: But it's pegged at least a quarter point cut
118.16s: if not a half point cut.
119.80s: I find that interesting because a big part of this move
123.04s: that we saw here, in my opinion,
125.80s: was the expectation of a cut.
127.60s: But now the expectation of a cut is even higher
130.96s: and we're not making that kind of parabolic shift.
134.08s: So that I find to be slightly interesting.
136.92s: I don't know if there's necessarily a ton to read
139.16s: into it just yet.
140.00s: It's kind of one of those FYI bits of information
143.64s: in my opinion.
144.48s: That's at least how I'm treating it.
146.36s: Now, when I look across earnings so far,
150.60s: we did have an interesting earnings release today,
153.52s: Home Depot, if you didn't have a chance to look through it,
155.92s: you should.
157.08s: But essentially they're talking about some softening
159.76s: in the consumer.
160.80s: And Home Depot overall still performed really well.
163.44s: They came in at 467 against 454 expected earnings per share.
168.64s: So they did fine.
169.48s: They still beat.
170.60s: But one of the comments I picked up from the releases
172.92s: that they were talking about, a slightly ego,
176.28s: the consumer paused in July.
177.80s: You can kind of see, right, now I'm in the way on this side.
180.56s: Unbelievable.
181.40s: No matter what I do, I'm in the way.
183.20s: But it's this line item here.
185.88s: I thought that that was interesting to keep an eyeball on.
188.88s: So overall, when I look at the market writ large,
192.52s: I see net highs lows still trending negative.
195.64s: The fact that net highs lows is trending negative,
198.72s: it tells me that this movement is being really, really
201.48s: propped up by a small handful of names.
204.56s: And I can see gross highs expanding
207.20s: in gross lows decreasing, but still net is negative.
210.96s: So I also find that generally interesting
214.56s: from a market synthesis perspective.
217.16s: Now, let's take a quick look over at our friend, Jimmy.
221.68s: See what's going on in here.
222.88s: And we are essentially just trending sideways, which is good.
225.52s: I think the fact that we're consolidating as we are here,
229.68s: bodes relatively well for the stock.
232.04s: It kind of found its threshold here,
234.48s: really ran into strong support, strong by volume,
238.00s: popped it back up.
239.24s: And it's kind of been running sideways here, which is okay.
241.32s: Because if you look at the performance of small caps here,
244.16s: it's also good, but it's not great.
247.04s: So game stop to me essentially just looks like it's waiting
250.64s: for some sort of catalyst.
252.12s: That's the overwhelming sensation that I get
255.16s: as I look at the stock.
257.28s: Now, we are below the point of control still,
260.80s: which is important to note.
262.56s: The other thing is as I look at OI,
265.36s: I'm seeing about 700,000 calls against 341,000 puts.
269.68s: So put OI is still expanding a bit.
272.80s: Now, one of the things I'm curious about
274.76s: is this 16-OG OI is 290,000 out of that 696.
280.28s: It's a big bucket.
281.72s: So one of the things I am going to be looking for
284.20s: throughout the rest of this week
285.44s: is to see if people are continuing to do what we tend to see them do,
288.80s: which is reposition into the next expiration cycle.
291.48s: The next primary expiration is 20 September,
294.64s: which is kind of like this red-ish, orange-ish red.
297.40s: And I don't see a lot in there yet.
299.60s: I see a little bit here, which looks like the 30s.
302.84s: There is 10,000 OI there now, people building out to that.
307.28s: But the other thing to keep in mind is that we have earnings
310.20s: coming up on the 4th of September before the market.
313.96s: So the other expiration cycle,
316.16s: I expect to see get way more busy is this 6-SEP.
319.80s: But again, as I already pointed out
321.16s: that I can't help but find interesting,
323.04s: is that the vol is still so low in here.
326.68s: I really would anticipate this growing a bit.
330.64s: So game stop right now, overwhelming sensation
334.44s: is kind of a bit of a holding pattern.
336.40s: The options aren't showing me anything
338.52s: that's like super interesting, just yet.
341.00s: We are still seeing a healthy mix of order flow
344.44s: across different prices.
346.04s: Most of the bigger transactions are super far out in time.
349.60s: So the 16 Jan 26, 25.
352.36s: So much further out in time.
354.64s: There was this trade here in 16,
356.88s: all 24, the 23 calls, 349 of them came out.
361.48s: These were sold.
362.72s: So this looks like probably covered calls would be my best guess.
366.04s: So this is not an insignificant size position,
368.88s: but it's nothing insanely large just yet.
371.76s: So generally quite day.
373.68s: I was texting with Newton a little bit earlier,
376.24s: and I'm still under the weather,
377.68s: but seems like he's starting to feel better.
379.44s: So shout out to Newton.
380.84s: Hope you feel better brother.
381.80s: And then we'll see about when we can get back on
383.68s: for another GME live stream.
384.96s: But first, gotta focus on healing.
387.16s: As always, if there's anything you need,
388.40s: be an outlier.
389.88s: See you guys later.
