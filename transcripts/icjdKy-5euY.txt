0.00s: I think a lot of us when we heard that you're leaving Tasty Live obviously most people are completely shocked
8.24s: and it's because you've obviously built your whole life around markets doing that whole thing.
12.88s: I think sometimes people forget that your serial entrepreneur did the whole think or swim thing,
16.64s: then made a jump, did something else and this is kind of part of your broader MMO,
20.80s: but I think a lot of us got rolled into a fall sense of security and the news drops.
26.72s: So talk to us about that. What led to the switch?
32.24s: And can you explain a little bit about the timing? Why then?
40.72s: Sure, because so I am definitely an entrepreneur. I'm a little bit of a cycle in that sense.
50.80s: For the last 44 years I have worked essentially for myself. I have even what I've killed basically.
62.80s: The only two times I've ever received a paycheck in 44 years where,
68.00s: well, right when I got a college I had a job for about six months, but that doesn't count.
73.68s: When we got bought out by TD Ameritrade and then when we got bought out by IG,
78.32s: only times I've ever received a paycheck. It simply checks though.
82.80s: Yeah, but not something that I'm used to or whatever, it doesn't. It didn't register with me.
89.12s: At TD, I didn't cash a check for two years until they basically said,
94.88s: you've got to cash these checks and they're not going to be good anymore. And IG, I cash a check,
100.32s: but I had no idea what they paid me. I got it even no. I didn't even know. I didn't even know.
104.88s: I swear to God, I don't know. So I've been pretty much on my own. I still consider it and
112.72s: you know, always being on my own. And after you get bought out, you lose control. And it's kind of a
120.32s: weird thing. When we got bought out the first time by TD, I stayed on for two years because I just,
128.88s: you know, I was, I had, I had agreed to stay on for three years, but I was very close to the
136.00s: CEO Fred Tomzack at the time. And after two years, I went to him and said, you know, Fred,
144.00s: am I ever going to be the CEO of TD Ameritrade? And he looked at me and he said, not, not over
148.96s: my dead body. And so we laughed about it and I said, listen, you know, I got to do something else.
156.64s: And because I, I'm getting older, I got to, you know, I got to build some stuff. And he's like,
162.88s: I'm surprised it took you this long. He goes, I'm shocked. You're still here. He goes, you could stay as long
167.60s: as you want, but you know, and they were, they're paying me a lot of money and do whatever. But I just
173.36s: was like, I want to go on and build something. And so he goes, what do you want to build? I go,
177.60s: I want to build this company called Tasty Trader. He goes, oh my God, I hate that name.
181.36s: Worst than think or swim. And I'm like, well, think or swim worked out pretty good for you. And he goes,
186.24s: yeah, did. So I go. And he said, what is it going to be? And I said, well, we're going to build this
191.28s: network. And at the time, there was also a single streaming. So I said, it's a streaming network,
197.60s: you know, and he's like, what is a streaming network? And I'm like, you know, we're going to talk
201.20s: about markets. And we're going to talk about trading. We're going to talk about math and quantitative
207.60s: stuff. And he goes, none of that makes any sense to me. But whatever you do, I want in. And
215.92s: so I go, okay. So he goes, how much? I go, well, I'll put up my money and you got to put up some money.
222.56s: He goes, I'll put up 20 million. Okay, which is a lot for an idea. And I go,
230.40s: all right, that's more than fair. And he didn't know anything. He hated the name, he hated the idea.
235.60s: And he's like, but I'm vetting on you. Because whatever you do, I think it's going to work.
240.08s: So I'm like, okay, well, I was going to head, we put up the money. They put up a portion of their
246.56s: money at the time. And then I quickly realized, I didn't want anymore of their money.
252.40s: Because I didn't want, I didn't need their money, I didn't want it. But it was very nice
256.40s: and generous. And we cut a marketing deal with them. And we went ahead and built tasty. And it
260.32s: became crazy, successful of the next, you know, 10 years. And I kind of had this old,
267.28s: remember the BOF steam was the GM of the Boston Red Sox took them to the World Series. And then twice.
276.24s: And then he was the GM of the Cubs and took the Cubs to the World Series. So he's a very successful GM.
284.80s: And he always used to say, they said, why do they leave the Red Sox to go as well? After 10 years,
289.92s: it was just time. So after 12 years at Thinkerswim. And then it was 15 years at tasty. We started
299.68s: in 2010 until the middle of or end of 2025. And we sold the company in 2021. And I lasted four
309.84s: years after we sold. Because I love what I do. I loved talking about markets. I loved
317.04s: the whole tasting nation. I loved everything about it. But I no longer had to
322.00s: had to see the table because I didn't want them. I was the largest shareholder of the company
327.20s: in a publicly traded company in the UK. But I was, I was the largest shareholder, but I didn't want
335.12s: to say anymore. I didn't want to say. I didn't, if I wasn't going to, I tried to run the company
340.08s: at one point. I went to the board at IG and I said, I think I should run this company because
348.08s: I'm a better CEO than the people that you have. And I understand this business better than anybody
353.68s: this company. And and you guys have been stuck in the mud for 40 some years. Let me run the company
359.92s: and let me take it global. But they love the same thing that TD Ameritrade said to me, which is
366.40s: go pound sand. Which, you know, I mean, obviously everybody's entitled to that. They go,
375.44s: we want your company, but we don't want you to run it. We don't want you to run this whole thing.
379.92s: I'm like, okay, I just wanted to make sure we understood. And I made it pretty passionate,
383.68s: get case for it. You know, to move to London, I wanted to run the whole thing globally. They said,
387.76s: no, it's fine. Well, then I don't want to run the US anymore. I just want to do my thing.
392.08s: And they're like, okay, that's fine. So four years into the deal, I decided it's time. I can finally
399.52s: sell some stock. I decided it's time for me to move on. I have nothing but great things to say about
405.68s: tasty. It's an amazing company. It's probably the best brokerage firm on the planet.
412.32s: You know, I still use the platform, you know, 50 to 100 times a day. And the people there are
420.08s: but it was just time for me to go out on my own terms. So to answer your question, the long form,
425.84s: it was just time for me to go out on my own terms. And I had an idea of them working on for a couple
431.36s: of years and it was time for me to go and take over a new company that I'm the lead investor in
437.92s: or one of the lead investors, but I had never run the company until, you know, two or three weeks ago.
