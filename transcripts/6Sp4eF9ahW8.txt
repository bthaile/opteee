0.00s:  What's up, bowliers. Welcome back to the Outlar podcast. I'm joined again with my friend
6.32s:  David Hunter. This is, I don't even know how many times we've talked now. It's got to
10.24s:  be like half a dozen plus. At least. Yeah. Yeah. We've had a really fun time exploring
16.08s:  the markets and understanding the way that you're looking at things. And as we were literally
19.72s:  just talking about before we press record here, we are now yet again. I feel like every
24.60s:  time I talk to you, we're in these really weird times. It's either a global pandemic or
28.12s:  it's some sort of financial crisis and here we are again. So welcome back looking forward
32.28s:  to chatting. Yeah. I agree to you. And yeah, that we're dull moment here. Yeah. So I guess
39.32s:  to start off, one of the big things that we had been talking about, obviously your your
45.48s:  broad thesis. And before we get into the details of the broad thesis, how it's playing out
49.60s:  and those kinds of things, I was giving you a little bit of context on a general curiosity
53.92s:  I have. And again, we approach markets from different perspectives, right? You're a very
58.24s:  macro long term big, big picture view. I'm very trade oriented day to day looking to just
63.96s:  find what opportunities I can capture. Now, one of the things I find so interesting about
70.20s:  markets is that they are constantly evolving. And there can be a lot of periods where you
74.36s:  have an idea and then some sort of new piece of information enters the system that wasn't
79.20s:  necessarily expected and then the idea changes. Now, you're kind of experiencing that to,
86.04s:  I mean, just a massive effect, not even looking at an individual stock. We're talking a massive
92.28s:  global system. And I want to understand the way that you think about how you're formulating
99.64s:  these ideas. And for example, the melt up into the bust, that's a really big idea with
106.28s:  very specific criteria that you've ironed out and you've shared previously. But it seems so
111.96s:  susceptible to new pieces of information entering the system. So how does that play into your
119.00s:  broader thesis? Are the underlying conditions so powerful that as new pieces enter the system,
124.32s:  they're kind of secondary, the things are ready set or does it behave differently?
128.36s:  Yeah, surprisingly, I mean, my forecast has not changed the logic. It'll be surprised. It's changed
135.32s:  in a more bullish direction, actually. I've raised targets. So surprisingly, you know, as big as the
143.64s:  tariff's hour, as big as what's going on right now is my macro underlying macro thesis, the underlying
154.04s:  fundamentals and underlying thesis that is getting me to these extreme forecasts both in the
161.72s:  up and down are not really changed a lot by what's happening. Part of that is because I'm making
170.84s:  some assumptions that, you know, the tariff situation will play out and it won't be what we see now.
179.80s:  I mean, you saw in the last two or three weeks the reaction. And, you know, your crowd reacts
189.64s:  instantly to that and goes to the worst case, right? And then if the tape joins them, they just
196.12s:  really go crazy on the downside. You know, I'm stepping back and saying, what the dust settle? It's not,
203.80s:  this is not what you're going to see over the next several months. You know, he's negotiating.
210.36s:  Doesn't mean we won't have tariffs, but they're not going to be these tariffs. And, you know,
215.32s:  St. Louis heads will prevail, etc. And not the Trump isn't sincere, but because he will keep
223.16s:  tariffs if he has to. But ultimately, he's holding most of the cards because we are the, you know,
230.04s:  the big market that everybody depends on. And we take that away from them with the tariffs.
235.72s:  Their economies are going to go to hell a lot faster and a lot deeper than ours is. So, so I'm,
241.00s:  that kind of helps a lot to not overreact to what is going on. And meanwhile,
249.00s:  in the markets and on the street, most people are overreacting or it might be overreacting,
255.24s:  but certainly reacting in a big way. And that only, because the other part of me is, yes,
260.52s:  I'm long term macro, but I'm also contrarian. And that just feeds into my stuff.
266.84s:  Sentiments not been disparishing a long time. I mean, this is as barishes you get pretty much.
272.60s:  People are just assuming we saw the top. We're going down. And, you know, people are playing
279.96s:  leapfrog in terms of how low we're going to go. So when I see sentiment at that level, it just,
286.60s:  you know, it actually increases my bullishness. And in this case, because of the way it happened,
294.20s:  because of wherever based position, I raised targets. So that obviously begs the question.
301.00s:  The natural question is if you're thinking about or if you raise the targets which we'll get into,
307.96s:  what's the driver behind it, assuming there obviously needs to be a catalyst to cause that. And
314.20s:  we might even come under the guise of, well, even if let's just use best case scenario where
320.36s:  tariffs just go away. That kind of just puts us back to where we were before they went down.
326.68s:  That's not like some sort of massive positive catalyst unless it's combined with a lot of better,
332.28s:  you know, agreements that are made. So yeah, tariffs,
335.72s:  tariffs go away on our side, perhaps, you know, even the 10th or maybe, but
342.20s:  10% or not 10%. We'll be back down from these, the extra tariffs. The other side is going to have
350.12s:  to give up a lot of tariffs. So I mean, we already have heard that Vietnam's willing to go to zero.
355.72s:  If we go to zero, there's other trade barriers that cause, you know, there's more to be done. But
362.20s:  I think what you're going to see in Mexico and Canada and in the Asian ring and in Europe is
371.80s:  tariffs may not go away, but they're coming down. Those countries, you know, again, Trump is playing
376.68s:  poker and he's got most of the cards. He's got the good cards. And I think Besson was the one that said,
383.40s:  you know, China is playing with the paratuse. So, you know, a lot of this is really,
389.32s:  Trump, Trump wouldn't, if he didn't have a strong hand, this would be foolish.
393.96s:  But we are the ace in the hole in terms of the markets. These other countries, economies go to hell.
399.24s:  Particularly export countries like Germany or China, you know, and even some of the third world
408.44s:  countries like Vietnam, you know, they can't afford to just kind of play a hardball and say, yeah,
416.20s:  you want to do that, I'll do that. Well, the problem is we can survive much more because we don't
422.60s:  have, we're not really depending on your markets, but you are depending on our markets. So,
427.88s:  so I think that's the, you know, one of the keys. Now, what, you know, what I would say is
434.20s:  that the thing that drove my, my forecast at the beginning, from the beginning is,
440.20s:  I believe rates are coming down, I believe inflation is coming down, I believe the economy is
445.32s:  slowing and that that's not bearish at the bullish. You know, the economy, people, we may be in
453.00s:  recession already, but we're certainly heading for recession. And people think that's a
457.32s:  sign that the market is peaked and we sell off. I go, no, the market will go up into that recession,
463.56s:  as long as it's viewed as a containable recession. You know, if it turns into something harder land,
469.16s:  much harder landing, then that may end my thesis. But at this point in time, you're not seeing any of
475.80s:  that. And I think the odds are that this low economy will certainly help the bond market in
482.60s:  spite of the, you know, the history the last week. You'll see the bond market rates come down,
490.20s:  the bond market control interest rates, not the Fed. So rates will come down and I think come
494.36s:  down quite substantially. You know, I'm still calling for a sub three percent by, sometimes
500.12s:  the summer that doesn't mean by June, but certainly, you know, by, by August or September,
505.72s:  you could be looking at sub three percent, maybe even two and a half percent on the 10 year.
510.76s:  That's a huge amount of ease without any Fed, you know, we're having this tip for tad or a battle
517.32s:  between Powell and Trump. Neither one likes the other one. And, you know, if it's, if people get
525.24s:  scared of that because they think it's, you know, real problematic, I keep, I keep repeating.
531.08s:  You know, the bond market's in charge of rates. The bond market is, you know, the vigilante is
536.36s:  what everyone would have called me. Investment firms that are buying bonds when the economy slows
542.20s:  are going to, are going to buy bonds more bonds because the economy is slowly. And I'm not worried
547.64s:  about China bailing out on their our tragedies. I'm not really worried about Japan. Ultimately,
554.60s:  and we saw, you know, we were at 455, 457, you know, several days ago and we're, you know, we
561.96s:  came all the way back down to four and a quarter or thereabouts and now we're up in the four thirties.
569.08s:  You know, rates are coming down. They're not going up. So all this history about that just adds
573.64s:  to the pessimism out there. And I call that a wall of worry that means people have acted on their
579.88s:  fears, which means their position defensively, whether they're in cash or short, short tragedies or,
586.44s:  you know, very defensive stocks. That means the next move will be out of that defensive position,
593.00s:  out of that, it's buying power for the future. So you'll see, you'll see them come back into more
600.20s:  aggressive positions when the dust clears. At least that's what I believe. So, and, and before the
606.84s:  tariffs, you know, was that lower rates, lower economy, lower inflation scenario that was going to
612.20s:  drive us to the S&P 7500 now, I'm saying S&P 8000. So, and I think one of the last times we spoke,
622.20s:  I actually think it was around now that you were expecting the, the bust to be getting close to
627.96s:  underway, but it sounds like with the new revision to the upside, things have shifted a bit. What were
635.48s:  the, the primary drivers of the shift as far as you see it? Yeah, I'm actually my, my bus
644.52s:  scenario has not, or timing wise, has not really changed. It could get pushed out certainly.
648.76s:  It is just thing if this thing drags out. I'm basically, I came into this year saying probably a
654.92s:  fourth quarter event. And I'm still saying it could start the fourth quarter. Doesn't mean it has to.
661.40s:  It could, you know, wait until next year, but I haven't changed a lot of timing because of this,
667.56s:  because it's, it's dependent on how fast this all, you know, works its way through. But the market,
672.52s:  in my opinion, that very violent sell-off bottoms, you know, down at 48 or 900 on the S&P,
681.32s:  and we've had a pretty good runoff of that. There's a lot of people out there expecting a retester,
686.20s:  new lows. It's possible. I don't think it's likely. I think we're starting our, you know,
692.36s:  starting our next leg up. And so, you know, it's not going to be recognized as that for a little
698.60s:  while because I think people are still worried about that second leg, or the second tune to drop.
704.28s:  But you could turn around a couple weeks and say, hey, we're back near the highs, you know, or we're
710.76s:  back, you know, we're back at the high five thousand. So, so I don't think time-wise, we,
718.20s:  you know, would might have lost a month. Got it. Now, what do you make of the relationship
724.28s:  with bonds and equities here? Because obviously, for a while, they became highly correlated.
728.84s:  And it seemed like they were starting to resume a normal, less correlated relationship. And then
734.04s:  more correlated, the overall behavior between the two has been really interesting. So I'm curious
739.64s:  your thoughts on the interplay. Yeah, it's, I, I mean, I continue to expect that bond and stocks
746.04s:  are going to have big rallies into the summer. So it's not just the stock market. I think the bond,
752.68s:  as I said, rates are going to, you know, 10 years going to come down under 3%. That's a big rally
757.56s:  from here. I, I think, you know, slowing economy, lower inflation helps stocks, but it also helps
766.76s:  bonds. I just don't buy into this. It was a, it was a weird panic, I thought that we all
773.24s:  said we pushed the rate back from sub four 20 back up to 450 on the 10 year. And people were panic
780.68s:  that I said, look, two weeks ago, that we were at 440. And I had talked about in, in earlier in
787.72s:  March, that it was setting up as a head and shoulder top in rates. So you on the 10 year, it looked
792.84s:  like you were, you know, you had a gap at 440. And you had a, a right shoulder that if you did
800.68s:  the perfect right shoulder was at 450. And bonds got up to about 437, 38. And took off. It went
808.44s:  down under 420. So I said, well, it doesn't have to fill the gap. And it doesn't have to, you know,
813.80s:  it's not, it doesn't have to be a perfect right shoulder. So maybe we had that correction in
818.68s:  in rates. And it's now moving down. Well, we got down to almost 4% based on the tariff news and
825.56s:  everything. And then it shot right back up to that 440, 450. And everybody's panicking and I go,
834.52s:  it's really, you know, it's 10 basis points above where it was a week and a half ago, or less
840.44s:  a week and a half ago. You guys are acting like this is the move is from four. It's not. We did
846.20s:  a round trip. We just went down and back up. It was kind of a surprise move down to four.
851.08s:  And a surprise move back up into this. And then it pushed above that 450 to, you know,
856.44s:  that morning to like 457. And people were panicked and saying, China's dumping bonds.
863.96s:  This is a sign that there's some kind of a credit event out there. And, you know, people's
868.44s:  imaginations ran wild. Well, you know, you let it settle even that day. It got back down
874.04s:  under 450 and, you know, it was down at 427 or something yesterday. So I just think it's
881.56s:  much more about people's emotions than it is about reality out there. I think what I see is
889.48s:  a bond market that bottomed, you know, several months ago and just working its way higher rates.
896.28s:  So obviously topped. They're working with good people. Forget it. We're at 5% on the 10 year,
901.32s:  you know, several months ago. So we're still in the downtrend and rates. It just had some volatility
907.16s:  within that period. I see. Now, when Trump first announced the tariffs leading into it, he was
915.32s:  pretty straightforward about a lot of what he was talking about doing. And then when he launched
921.24s:  the tariffs, the curveball obviously was the 10% on everything. That wasn't really message
927.00s:  ahead of time very well or at all. And that, you know, the market was like, okay, this is quite a
932.28s:  bit different than than what I thought. When you're looking at the relationships between the various
939.48s:  economies that are out there against the tariffs as they've been set out, what are your thoughts
948.04s:  on the game of chicken that's now happening? Because we can see some countries to your point,
953.00s:  definitely Vietnam. A lot of those smaller countries have definitely started saying, okay,
958.36s:  we'll play ball. And then there's other countries that are saying like China, okay, let's play.
964.60s:  And there's also the artifact of now Russia and China are even talking about doing natural gas
971.72s:  deals together. Obviously, part of that's just being played up to add volatility to everything. But
976.84s:  nonetheless, there's absolutely something to be said about other economies getting closer together.
982.44s:  X US. So how does that all play out in your view? Yeah, well, first of all, I do think there are
991.24s:  maybe 40 or 50 countries that are coming to the table. And I think we are going to see deals
996.52s:  announced over the next several weeks. And as those deals get announced, even if they're not the
1001.64s:  big players, it starts to look like, hey, there's a master playing here that's working. So, you know,
1008.84s:  obviously the two main players here that are problems are China and Europe or the ECB. And also,
1016.52s:  they're not the ECB, but EU. And I think the EU starting to come around, they're not certainly not
1024.92s:  playing hardball to the degree that China is. China was always known to be number one, the primary
1031.16s:  target and the biggest issue we have is what obviously China trade. And number two was likely to be
1041.08s:  the one that would play the hardest ball. They would fight us the most. So all I can say right now is
1048.28s:  I believe where the market is versus where I think it works out. The market, I think, is far too
1056.68s:  pessimistic about it. I think standard heads are going to prevail on both sides. It's in both our
1063.00s:  interests. Again, people, it's almost like investors want to think of this in terms of all
1069.88s:  or none. Trump wants all trade with China knocked off. And we want to bring all everything back
1080.84s:  on shore and all that. It's at the margin. You know, you're trying to get this thing turned around
1085.88s:  at the margin. And he's right in what he's trying to accomplish. I hear all the time. Well, I agree
1092.68s:  with what he's trying to do, but I don't agree with those tactics. The problem is, if you did it in a
1099.08s:  more reasonable way, China would never come around. I mean, you've got to do this and the nice,
1106.04s:  the good thing for our side, I think, is you've got a president who has a backbone who means what
1113.40s:  he says and who will, you know, he's willing to play to an extent, not always, but to an extent,
1121.64s:  you're willing to play long ball. You know, it's not, it's not everybody seemed to think he was
1126.52s:  going to buckle with the stock market. And, you know, he has to, you know, actually, it was good
1132.04s:  to see that he came to a little bit on things and gave them the next stuff.
1137.00s:  Yeah, with the text up, even before that, the 90 day, you know, grace period. It's realistic. I
1144.36s:  think he's got good people around him. People want to portray him as a, you know, madman, but, you
1150.12s:  know, best and snowman, man, he's got, you know, I think he's maybe the best treasury secretary we've had.
1156.28s:  And although Navarro, maybe the mad, the mad scientist in this design, in terms of what we're doing,
1166.28s:  he's absolutely right. You know, we, we've, this is four decades in the coming and you just
1172.92s:  have to do something pretty drastic to turn it around. So, but I think cooler heads will prevail
1179.16s:  ultimately. I don't know what that will look like. I think it will accomplish some of our goals,
1184.92s:  but not all of Trump's goals. But I think in the end, what you're going to have, if you fast forward
1191.48s:  a month, baby, a month or a month and a half, is you're going to have what looks like for your trade
1198.04s:  around the world, lower tariffs from our trading partners allowing us to have more access to their
1204.44s:  markets, not free access. I don't think we're going there, probably. And, and you're going to be able
1211.16s:  to look and say, you know, a month ago or a month and a half ago, I thought everything was going to crash,
1218.28s:  we were going to have, you know, this was in 1930s. You know, this is smooth hauling. We're going to
1225.48s:  protectionist policies. And now I step back and realize we're freer in trade than we were coming
1232.36s:  into this year. We're, we're seeing deals left and right of people who are recognizing and make
1238.68s:  sense to come and build plants in this country. And, and both China and the US have agreed to
1245.16s:  something. I think that I think that lists all that weight off the shoulders of the market and
1251.40s:  it rises as aggressively. And then you've got in there short covering that will play. And, you know,
1259.32s:  when you shift from sentiment that's, you know, based on dire outlook to sentiment that says,
1266.84s:  hey, things are, you know, may not be, you know, perfect, but things are looking better than they
1274.68s:  were coming into this. You know, it's a big, big move, a big gap between where you were position
1282.68s:  or where you need to be position. And that's why markets, you know, get it up.
1288.12s:  Now, one of the things I've seen mentioned about the approach with tariffs so far, which I do
1296.20s:  find interesting is there's a really good argument, I think, that the path taken so far definitely
1305.00s:  albeit aggressive does lead to more things happening more quickly. Then there's the other part
1313.40s:  of this argument that says in doing that, you cause a tremendous amount of disruption, distrust,
1320.52s:  and other countries might look at it as the US is less reliable. Do you think that there's
1326.92s:  an element of that at play here and if so, what impact? Yeah, for sure. I mean, I would think if I
1333.40s:  were on the other side of this, I'd be pretty, you know, I'd be pretty pissed off and, and, uh,
1339.08s:  feel like, you know, and again, there's that narrative's out there around surrounding Trump anyway. So,
1344.52s:  you know, there is easier to buy it. Something that's already out there that, you know, he can't be
1349.96s:  trusted. He's, you know, you'll do these things. But part of that is the element of unpredictability that
1359.08s:  I think causes them to have to come to the table if you were predictable. And maybe China thinks
1365.48s:  he is. Maybe that's why they're playing hardball. But I think of it the longer this space, they're
1370.04s:  going to say, hey, he's not, he's not folding like we thought he would. And if you look at some of
1375.32s:  the other countries, I think that again, it comes down to their economies. I think we are more resilient
1383.56s:  given given that we are less dependent on exports than Germany, that Europe, China,
1391.00s:  than a lot of these countries. And ultimately, I think that's what will get negotiations going. And
1397.56s:  I think they are going, obviously, the tougher ones are going to be the harder ones to get to the table.
1403.72s:  Right. Well, and it's also been a big part that every time I've seen asked of him how he would treat
1410.84s:  things like car vows and stuff like that. And he is made it pretty clear that he's open to discussion.
1418.84s:  So I think that tips that had a little bit in a way from the from the jump that he's not necessarily
1425.88s:  looking at maintaining this longer term as you've already generally pointed out. Now, the effect
1432.68s:  of reshoring some of these industries, how does that in your view play into the broader economy?
1441.32s:  Because one of the interesting things I've seen discussed is this conversation around GDP, GDP
1446.52s:  slowing, cutting government spending, government spending is a big part of GDP. And then you have
1451.00s:  the conversation of is that even GDP? And it's like these different levels to the discussion.
1457.88s:  But the reshoring element is really interesting to me. Because again, you know, I have a military
1461.64s:  background. And from that, I like that for a lot of reason. Because as anybody who studies war,
1468.92s:  it genuinely is one through logistics. If you have really good fighting forces, but they run out of
1474.60s:  what they need, it doesn't matter. They could be really great dudes, really capable, but you can't
1479.00s:  shoot nothing. So I find from a defensive perspective, it very interesting and pertinent
1486.12s:  COVID gave us a little bit of a preamble on what this could look like. But from an economic lens,
1492.44s:  how does the reshoring element fit into your broader assessment of the economy? What kind of impact
1498.12s:  does that? Yeah, first of all, I think you're dead on. And that's where I think Wall Street's kind
1502.84s:  of short-sighted is Trump, if this were purely economic and not national security, then you
1513.08s:  could say, well, you're making big bets here. And why did we need to do that? Yes, certainly,
1520.68s:  we would like more industry back here, et cetera. But you're really disrupting a lot to get that.
1527.72s:  But national security almost demands that we do this. We could, as you well know, we could not do
1534.76s:  a World War II again. We don't have the steel capacity, we don't have the manufacturing capacity
1540.12s:  to convert everything over to wartime and roll out the military hardware we need. I mean,
1548.28s:  it's just not possible. Now, I know electronics is a bigger part of it today. We could probably do that.
1554.28s:  But I think national security is a big part of why he's doing this and why he says we don't.
1561.40s:  We can't stretch us out, it says we don't know. Reshoring itself from an economic standpoint,
1568.84s:  yeah, I mean, you and I know a lot of these commitments are going to take years to build,
1575.56s:  right? And frankly, you don't know whether you can trust even some of the commitments,
1581.32s:  because some of them will drag your feet and hope he's gone in three years, three and a half years,
1586.68s:  and never build the plant here. But I think they're going to hold people's
1592.68s:  companies' feet to the fire a lot, I think, to make sure this stuff is, you know, you've started your
1597.56s:  plant, you're getting going. It's still going to take time, but I think they can move pretty quickly
1603.80s:  in terms of some of this. And I think he's got plants to kind of incentivize that even.
1608.92s:  But remember, my forecast is that we're heading into recession and then that will morph into a
1616.28s:  global bust. I'm not expecting reshoring to jumpstart this economy and get us out of this,
1625.24s:  you know, in the next year. I think reshoring will play a big role in the recovery after the
1631.32s:  bust. It will play a big role, I think, in the meltup in terms of the concept of reshoring and the
1638.92s:  dollars that are coming in here now, but the actual production that comes out of reshoring and the,
1645.00s:  you know, the restoration of our industrial base is really a, you know, 2027, 839, 30 type thing.
1655.72s:  But markets discount ahead, concepts do help drive markets. So I think the reshoring will help the meltup,
1664.36s:  but the actual results of reshoring, I don't think we see for a couple more years.
1672.68s:  What is the piece of information, the market effect, the occurrence, whatever the actual trigger
1681.72s:  ultimately ends up being that transitions us right now from this relatively historic pullback
1688.28s:  actually in terms of speed and velocity. This is right unprecedented and from a trading
1694.92s:  perspective, it's fascinating because a big thing that I trade as volatility and you can track
1700.04s:  how volatility has changed over the past decades, which is a whole other thing. But going back to
1708.84s:  the actual trigger events that leads to moving from where we are now into the meltup. What is that?
1719.24s:  Yeah, so first of all, that sell off. I mean, if I were a technician, and I've seen playing
1724.12s:  technicians that are in this position, I'd be barriced, right? I mean, we broke pretty significant
1730.44s:  trend lines and there's all kinds of reasons why you can look down. And yet, it never, I didn't
1735.88s:  fall through a bit because again, just like 2020 was kind of a, never saw that before, you know, 35
1743.88s:  percent down in three weeks, and yet I turned really bullish then. This same thing here is the
1751.40s:  sentiment turned so was negative going into it and turned so negative that I said these breaks
1759.24s:  are, you know, I don't want to call them false breakdowns, but they really were very quick and very
1765.88s:  temporary. And so that's why I was not surprised to see the rebound that we've seen and I think it's
1772.28s:  a real rebound, not a, you know, a relief rally. So that first of all, it'd be easy to be bearish,
1779.88s:  but you know, from a technical standpoint, so I understand why it has caused so many people to jump
1786.60s:  on that bandwagon. However, you know, I guess maybe it's my 50 years of doing this or whatever,
1795.08s:  you know, these, these technical rules are broken all the time. You know, if you get caught in a
1800.52s:  dogmatic view of how charts work and, you know, if you get this break, it means this, you're going
1806.84s:  to, you're going to get burnt because for every, for every rule, there's, there's going to be an
1811.48s:  exception, particularly in a period like this. And you had to step back and look and say, why did we
1816.68s:  get this break? What is that break doing? It's really causing people, you know, it was almost
1824.44s:  a way to manufacture fear, you know, that all you had to do was break that 5,500 on the S&P and you
1831.00s:  knew that there was another big step down coming. And, you know, you got it the next day or the next
1836.04s:  couple of trading days. Same thing, you know, obviously Russell looks terrible from a technical
1842.20s:  standpoint and yet I'm pretty bullish on it. So I think there are times when you have to learn that
1848.12s:  yes, technical analysis is a important tool, but don't make it your Bible. You know, don't think
1856.20s:  it, you know, sometimes it can be a fake out. So on the other side in terms of the bullishness,
1863.24s:  I think as we always find, you know, it starts moving up like we're seeing now just from,
1869.88s:  it feels like relief rally and because, you know, people start moving away from their, their worst
1876.92s:  fears. And then as take moves up, more people jump on. So I think, are you chasing a fly or what?
1889.72s:  No, I'm looking at the charts here because it's really interesting. I'm watching the
1894.12s:  difference between the eminies, Nasdaq and Russell. I actually had a follow up question for you.
1898.60s:  But I didn't want to interrupt you. Yeah, that's okay. So yeah, so I think we're moving into that
1904.76s:  period where if it keeps going here, that momentum works, you know, works in reverse. All of sudden,
1911.16s:  the tape moving up is going to first cross some short covering, which we've already seen some of that.
1918.28s:  But there's a lot more that can happen. And then as the tape continues, it just drags people back
1923.72s:  into the bullish side. You know, no matter what, momentum, you know, causes sentiment. You know,
1933.48s:  people really react to the tape and they've react very negatively to a negative tape. I think it
1938.76s:  won't be that long before you start seeing that turn around and people have to remember,
1944.28s:  you start from the lower left, move to the upper right, you know, on sentiment too. So you start
1950.44s:  at the bottom with, you know, deep bearer sentiment. That's a bullish thing when sentiment is
1956.60s:  this deeply bearish. And it doesn't move straight to bullish. It kind of moves less bearish,
1964.04s:  you know, more neutral and then bullish and then extreme bullish. So I think you'll see that play
1969.48s:  out over the next three to six months. Now, when I'm looking at the major indices here, I mean,
1978.20s:  from like a three month perspective, all of them are still pretty firmly down sloping. There was
1984.60s:  that bear recovery on the ninth of April. But then it's kind of been stalling and starting to fall
1992.04s:  past that. So are you viewing this just bouncing back and forth that we're kind of doing now since
1999.40s:  it's not like plummeting back down, but it's also not shooting up here. Do you view this more as
2003.88s:  like a consolidation thing? And then if so, what then becomes the catalyst to lead to the meltup?
2011.56s:  Yeah, I mean, I'm not a trader. So I don't, I don't pretend to know what the next week's going to
2016.28s:  look like. And so, you know, if I were betting, I would bet slightly bet that we're probably up
2024.12s:  from here that you get a day or two of this, you know, make it look like it's rolling back over,
2028.52s:  but it doesn't last. But if it if it if it did roll back over and retested, that wouldn't that
2034.12s:  wouldn't change my ultimate opinion either. So, yeah, I'm not caught too much in the very short
2040.04s:  term. My guess is, you know, I'll let the tape tell us. But if if this thing reverses back up here
2045.48s:  in the next, you know, either tomorrow or that early next week, this would just kind of a couple
2051.64s:  day, what what you're also getting is not just obviously tacked pebbles. What you're getting is
2056.52s:  news events, you know, the minute right comes out on Trump says something else, you know,
2062.84s:  outcome the sellers again saying, oh, see, this is where we're not out of the woods. So, you're
2068.44s:  going to have volatility based on, you know, whatever he tweets or says, you know, standard.
2077.16s:  Yeah, definitely. One one of the things you mentioned earlier was referencing the 2020
2083.56s:  bear market and then the eventual rally out of there. I think obviously the thing that comes to
2088.60s:  people's minds with that is had the Fed not intervene and did kind of historic measures.
2096.28s:  There's a good chance that could have led to a pretty big problem. Yeah, I was bullish. I was bullish
2101.00s:  in March of 2020 because of the Fed's response, you know, was $5 trillion. Not we didn't know 5 trillion
2109.72s:  initially, but there was a lot of money coming in along with a lot of programs from from Congress. So
2116.92s:  that that was what gave me a confidence that I don't think we're going to see that here by any
2121.56s:  means. I think we're in a different place for different reasons of bullish, but yeah, you're lacking,
2128.12s:  you're lacking anything close to that right now. There's no urgency on the part of the Fed.
2133.56s:  You know, if anything, the Fed's still talking a long game of, you know, we want to see what
2137.88s:  happens with the tariffs before we come in. I don't, you know, I really ignore Fed commentary
2145.48s:  in between meetings. You know, it's, they're doing two things. They're trying to send the message and
2152.52s:  Waller came out and talked more like eases and far away. And the next day, Powell's pretty much
2158.28s:  putting him back in his place with, you know, we're not anywhere near thinking that. So I think they
2166.68s:  want to convey a message that they're not in hurry to ease that they're, I think they're wrong
2172.76s:  in terms of feeling like they're in a kind of a great spot where they can pivot either way,
2178.20s:  depending on what, you know, what they get. To me, they're not really as, as is typical of the
2185.56s:  Fed. They're not really getting the leads and lags. You know, they get lip service to leads and
2190.68s:  lags and understanding those leads and lags to policy. But the way they act, they're caught
2197.32s:  looking at backward looking data and extrapolating forward until proven otherwise. And, you know,
2203.88s:  with leads and lags that are, you know, six, nine, 12, 18 months long, depending on what, you know,
2209.40s:  what you're leading to, you know, you can't play this backward looking, you know, we're data
2216.76s:  dependent. And that's what they're doing. I think it's pretty easy to look at what the tariffs
2221.88s:  are doing to companies and to worldwide trade and say, there's going to be disruption in the economy,
2230.12s:  not initially because initially you're getting numbers that are probably people buying ahead of
2234.92s:  the tariffs, right? So you're getting, you're getting some, like, you have good retail sales.
2241.00s:  And you're seeing some things that say the economy looks pretty good. You can't go by those numbers
2245.96s:  because those are basically pulling from the future. I think once we get out of month or two,
2253.08s:  numbers could not crater, but be down quite a bit. I think, you know, I very definitely think
2258.84s:  we could be in recession if we're not already before this quarter is out. So, you know, for the fed
2264.84s:  to kind of sit on their hand and say, oh, we're in a good place. We don't, you know, it's the
2269.96s:  economy's okay, jobs are okay. We could just kind of take our time and I think if you delay here,
2279.00s:  you're going to have to play catch up and that catch up will help my belt.
2284.04s:  Now, one of the things I'm so curious about here is the relationship of the recession because
2291.88s:  typically at the onset of recession, markets do generally react negatively to that. And before
2297.80s:  you had mentioned that you'd view the recession actually as a potential bullish catalyst. So then
2304.92s:  I'm trying to understand the timeline as you're seeing it with the involvement of the current state,
2312.12s:  the meltup and recession potentially in like the next quarter. What does that timeline actually
2317.56s:  look like? Not again, specific day. It's not specific months, but just the relationships.
2322.36s:  Yeah, so probably standard way people would look at things is that the market leads economies,
2329.16s:  right? So that the market would typically top out six months ahead of the economy maybe and
2334.92s:  start discounting the recession or six to nine months ahead of that. We're nowhere near. I mean,
2341.56s:  if we're in recession this quarter, obviously the market just topped out in March.
2348.68s:  I'm looking at it as it's and this is not kind of what we see typically in our cycles,
2357.80s:  but we're not in a normal cycle. I'm looking at there could be a period here where and I think
2365.08s:  there will be a period here where it looks like soft landing or slow down mild recession.
2372.52s:  And the feds responding to it saying, okay, now we got the ease. We're seeing that.
2378.68s:  But we're not in a hard laying scenario. In other words, a narrative will still be soft landing.
2383.24s:  Soft landing accompanied by lower inflation and maybe a lot lower inflation.
2389.56s:  And keep in mind that the narrative out there just a week ago and I think for some people still
2396.36s:  is that inflation is ticking up, not down, right? Everybody's worried even the fed worried about
2401.08s:  inflation. Well, I think inflation is going down. True inflation, the measure they measure is
2407.24s:  1.3 percent, I think. They're below the 2 percent target. Housing is roll over because of these
2412.76s:  high mortgage rates. And you've got oil down at $55. I mean, I don't know who's looking at
2422.44s:  higher inflation here, I think. And again, the one thing that's pushing everybody to higher inflation
2427.72s:  saying tariffs are inflationary. Tariffs aren't inflationary. They cause a one-time bump in prices,
2433.16s:  but they also cause a big dip in demand. So it doesn't, it's not sustainable inflation if that's
2441.08s:  the story. So I think the feds got it wrong. Those are worrying about inflation to have it wrong.
2446.68s:  And they're within very short time. I think they're going to come around to wow inflation.
2451.56s:  Actually, blowing towards that 2 percent target pretty fast. So you have lower inflation,
2459.08s:  soft landing, even though it may be a mild recession. And finally, the fed at our back, you know,
2465.64s:  fed back cutting rates, maybe even pumping a little money. And that happening at the same time
2473.08s:  that the tariffs are starting to get normalized. The tariff policy is starting to get normalized.
2478.28s:  People say, oh, it's not what we were fearing. You get all that in a concentrated period of two or
2484.36s:  three months and you can have a rip-rowing market. I see. Yeah, I can follow the thought process there.
2492.20s:  What are your thoughts around the, you were saying tariffs may or may not be inflationary depending
2498.68s:  on the effective demand? But what do you think about elasticity's involvement in that? Because with
2506.36s:  how broad the tariffs are, they're absolutely are going to be components that are captured that
2513.24s:  will have different measures of elasticity and the ability to either experience a decrease in
2519.00s:  demand or just accept heightened cost. Yeah, it's hard. I guess I've kind of put it on the side
2526.12s:  line a bit and said, until we get clarity on what really is going to come with that, I still think
2533.16s:  the primary story is negotiation and if anything moving towards free or trade, not more protectionist
2541.88s:  trade, you have to do this to get there. But I'm just kind of at this point saying, let's not jump
2550.60s:  to the negative side when the probabilities really suggest at least for me that more likely we're going
2557.40s:  to see negotiations and things. Trump may be very sincere about liking tariffs as a revenue
2567.24s:  razor, but I truly think his primary use of tariffs is to bring the other trading partners to
2575.16s:  the table and say, enough's enough. We've handed you our markets for free for too long. You have
2582.36s:  two choices. You can either run into real resistance. We can do what you did to us or we can both
2590.68s:  agree that you have to lower your tariffs so that we have more access. That I think is the more likely
2597.00s:  outcome of this, not everywhere maybe, but I mean, I look at Canada, Canada, Canada and Mexico are kind
2602.84s:  of a different story in some ways, but when you look at it's like there's no way that we're going
2611.56s:  to be where we are right now in terms of hurting each other. It doesn't make sense. There's
2617.32s:  got to be a true negotiation in both those countries where they come around to some extent and
2624.04s:  understand. We're not taking everything away from you, but we can't have it the way it is where
2631.16s:  you're terrifling us to the point where we don't have much in your markets and yet you have
2637.08s:  access to our markets. He's obviously trying to accomplish some other things there too. I just think,
2643.88s:  I guess I have some faith in Trump as a negotiator. I think another data point that
2652.04s:  supports pieces of that is I don't know if you saw this thing with the Texas and Mexico like this
2658.60s:  water deal. Are you familiar with that? No. I never heard of it before either, but
2664.84s:  and I don't want to speak too incorrectly about it. Just at a high level, I recently was reading
2669.72s:  about it, but there's an agreement where as we were dividing the Rio Grande and whatnot that there's
2676.20s:  a certain amount of water that is owed to us by Mexico that we to Texas that we historically have
2683.32s:  and collected on. I think it's coming up this year. It's like every decade or every five year
2688.84s:  time frame a certain volume is due and we've never bothered with it really.
2695.48s:  And Trump is now saying he wants to collect on that water for Texas. So I think not, you know,
2704.20s:  aside from the actual details of that, I think it does highlight part of what you're talking about
2710.04s:  more broadly. Whereas there's this global negotiation going on where we're trying to actually
2716.36s:  reestablish footing on a lot of different things. And yeah, that very much seems to be at least part
2722.92s:  of what's at play here. And I think, you know, I don't think we can make light of this act that
2730.76s:  what do you call tiniest or just a dislike or a disprostive Trump or what have you? It pervades
2737.72s:  Wall Street. It pervades obviously in Washington. It pervades the media. Well, wait, no, I'm saying the
2744.84s:  opposite. I'm saying the perception of him because people believe that he's polarizing or believe
2753.72s:  or just don't like him or his style. He's a very much New York style in your face, you know.
2760.28s:  And his whole negotiation style is I play hardball and then we back off from the
2766.60s:  you know, see our deal. I start with my most extreme negotiating position and then we work
2776.44s:  forward from there. But all that plus all the everything else that surrounds the politics from
2783.64s:  2016 on and particularly the left view of him. But certainly a lot of Wall Street bought into that
2790.44s:  and a lot of, you know, population bought into it. That's all part of why I think that everybody
2800.20s:  sides with, you know, we really have a strong reason to be doing what we're doing. We've given
2806.76s:  away our country for 40 years in a lot of ways. It benefited Wall Street, but it didn't benefit
2812.52s:  in the middle of America. And that's truly what he's trying to accomplish is bring back the jobs
2816.92s:  for middle America. That should be something that people are, you know, getting behind
2823.32s:  and very much supportive of, but because of TDS or whatever you want to call it, there's this natural
2829.64s:  tendency to doubt that he's doing anything good that he knows what he's doing, that he, I think he
2837.40s:  will go down to history as maybe a more successful president than Reagan and accomplishing bigger
2843.48s:  things and Reagan. But he's going to have to prove that because so many people doubt it.
2850.36s:  But I think that's why people, instead of this country kind of getting behind what we're doing,
2856.12s:  they jump to, they always assume that we have the weekend and the other sides are going to play us
2861.24s:  or whatever. We are in the driver's seat in a lot of ways because of our markets. And Trump
2867.88s:  understands that. I mean, we are the market to the world. And so, you know, there are problems. I'm
2875.48s:  not saying that it's, it's easy straight here, but I'm saying a lot of, I think the perception of
2880.44s:  Wall Street is because a lot of Wall Street is just like Washington. They don't like him or they
2885.08s:  don't trust him or they have TDS, whatever. And, you know, he's got some good sword and good people
2892.04s:  that back him, you know, I certainly do. But I do think if you were to take a poll a lot of what's,
2899.72s:  you know, what's the rhetoric out there? What's the sense out there? It's coming from
2905.72s:  personality more than, you know, and dislike of that personality more than it is reality.
2912.44s:  Sad, that contributes to the bearishness, contributes to the doubts. And I think the picture
2919.00s:  probably a lot better than that. Well, it's one of those things that's so fascinating because
2925.00s:  it's multivariate, right? There's a lot of different angles you can take because the, the concept
2931.48s:  of him trying to bring back the middle class to reestablish it in some of these different ways
2937.00s:  totally can see that view. And then there's also the view of, well, if you're a person that's looking
2941.72s:  to retire in the next six months, you're terrified right now because of this damage that has been
2949.72s:  done that directly affects you. Unfortunately, because it is the middle class and the lower classes
2956.68s:  that don't have obviously the excess disposable income to be able to survive those kind of drops
2962.12s:  and be able to, you know, live off of the same style. So it's one of those things where it's
2968.36s:  just such a fascinating culmination of to your exact point personality timing issue,
2974.44s:  press scenes depending on what matters to the individual. Because no matter what, as you've
2981.00s:  kind of pointed out here, there's no easy way to reflate America without causing massive
2988.04s:  disruption. It's just if you're going to try to. And frankly, I think it's naive to say we can
2996.12s:  go along the way we've gone because Wall Street's still doing okay. And, you know,
3003.16s:  most people have equity in their homes and stuff. Meanwhile, we're hand in advantages left
3010.68s:  and right to China that we won't be able to make up grounded. We're really at that. It's kind of
3016.36s:  the same thing as last November in the election. It truly was, I think, a dual or die election. If
3024.20s:  it had stayed, I don't want to get too much into politics, but if it had stayed with the Democrat
3031.08s:  candidate, it was very much moving us closer and closer to globalism, closer and closer.
3038.28s:  The globalist agenda is really a weak U.S. agenda, you know, looking for a way. And we would be,
3045.88s:  at some point, we were heading towards the British Empire, the Roman Empire. And this is our last
3051.80s:  best chance to reverse 40 years of bankruptcy. It's not all Democrats. The Republicans,
3058.84s:  with the exception of Reagan, the Bushes were part of that globalist agenda too.
3064.52s:  And this was really a one-time chance. And it's a short window. I mean, we don't even know if he's
3072.04s:  going to have a window beyond the first two years because of election, your election,
3077.80s:  your mid-term election. So he doesn't have a lot of time and he's trying to accomplish a lot of
3082.60s:  things. It's not just deregulations, another big story. We haven't talked about that. We'll be
3087.56s:  an offset to some of the negatives of tariffs. D-Rex is a big deal in terms of, so you have to
3096.92s:  kind of look at his whole agenda and realize-
3099.00s:  Also taxes.
3100.12s:  It's taxes. And whether he gets everything he wants, probably not, he is a pro-growth president.
3110.52s:  And we should be excited about that. And unfortunately, it is a negativity towards him.
3119.08s:  And frankly, Wall Street's kind of bent their book too because they'd much rather have things as
3124.44s:  they were. They were fat and happy. And, you know, Main Street was getting hit pretty hard.
3131.88s:  They're still kind of wanting to stay fat and happy and not worried about Main Street. Well,
3136.52s:  thank god we have a guy in there. It's a populist president. He's very much-
3141.08s:  he's sincere about that. He really understands Middle America has been
3145.64s:  hit hard for decades. And it's time to bring that back. But for, you know,
3151.00s:  for two reasons, economically for them, but also national security reasons.
3157.00s:  Another broad question I had with respect to just the economy and the inputs to it.
3164.28s:  My wife and I, we like to travel a lot. We actually just got back from Ireland. And we notice,
3170.76s:  when we're in a lot of these other countries, when you go into convenience stores, when you go
3175.72s:  into gas stations, when you go into shopping centers, you notice that it's like mostly
3182.60s:  local people that are just working those, you know, lower level jobs, those base level jobs.
3189.32s:  And a lot of places in the US still do that. But then there's also a lot of places that don't
3195.08s:  or a litany of different reasons, living wages and stuff like that. The question I have with
3200.92s:  respect to the economy and employment is what effect does that have that like the base
3209.96s:  middle class quote-unquote, which is also this esoteric term that ranges widely what people
3215.56s:  consider middle class. But what effect does that have when the living wage and the lifestyle that
3223.64s:  those kind of people would want to be able to work for seem to not either be available,
3229.00s:  not desirable, both of those I think exist to a pretty big degree to the individual. What effect
3234.52s:  does that have on the economy? And then I'm curious about the reshoring effect here. Like how many
3239.80s:  Americans are going to be actually really excited to go to these kinds of jobs potentially?
3244.68s:  Yeah, it's going to, it's probably going to have to evolve, you know, as always, it's not going to be
3249.48s:  instant. Yeah, we're, you know, we're giving up college, we're going to, you know, work in the
3254.36s:  factory or whatever. It'll evolve and the jobs are going to be very different in robotics,
3259.40s:  who's going to play a role, etc. So, you know, I think technology is going to be a big part of the
3264.76s:  new job landscape too. But I'll answer in a little different way, which is part of his deregulation
3277.40s:  is banking. I am argue for one time because I started in banking in up, you know, in Indiana,
3283.72s:  where it was countywide branching, you couldn't, you couldn't have a statewide bank, you,
3288.76s:  you're largest being the first you could go with your county lights. So we were largest, the bank,
3294.44s:  I started with was in my college town that got me into the investment business, you know, I had,
3298.84s:  it was a two-man shop, I was a second guy. So, but it was great training and it was, and we had a lot
3304.60s:  of, because it was North West Indiana, we had a lot of Chicago and Indianapolis bankers in the
3310.20s:  bank, you know, that wanted to be out of the way for the city and, you know, had expertise, but were,
3315.80s:  you know, so I was exposed to pretty good people, but, but then we had, you know, over the course of
3322.84s:  the next 30 years, you know, deregulation of banking and, you know, from that to statewide,
3329.64s:  and then the, you know, nationwide banking. So, we had the Bank of America's and the, the
3334.28s:  Chases and the City Banks, etc., that became nationwide, you know, big, big banks and some of the
3339.96s:  big superregions. What we lost, though, in the process is a lot of the banking is branches of
3349.00s:  these big banks in the smaller cities and towns. You lost that, President of the local bank that had,
3359.16s:  you know, was in the road reclaw and was, you know, friends with all the businesses in town and,
3365.40s:  you know, a lot of the, what they used to call the three C's, which included character,
3371.48s:  you know, credit character, I forget what the third one was, but basically when they were making
3375.40s:  loans, they were making loans to their neighbors. And now, you know, once we went to this, you know,
3382.76s:  full on big bank model, everything was a formula, you know, you had people take them,
3392.12s:  taking a credit application, but they didn't care who you were, they just said, you don't meet
3396.52s:  our criteria, you know, we're not lending that much right now, so you're not, you're not going
3402.04s:  to get it, you know, I think our smaller cities lost their heart and soul as a result of that.
3409.00s:  So going back that way, I think will be a big part of it. The other thing I'd say in relation to,
3415.72s:  so you're right, I do think, you know, these other countries and you see locals,
3422.20s:  they're working in their towns and they're basically, it's like we used to be.
3427.80s:  The other thing I will say is that without government spending, without the huge blow up in our
3433.24s:  government, the huge growth of our government over the last 30 years, everybody would realize
3440.28s:  our standard living has been dropping, but it was held together because of lots of handouts,
3446.76s:  lots of entitlements, lots of things. And unfortunately, in the meantime, we're not recognizing that we
3455.00s:  lost a huge part of our true productive economy. And what we're doing here, Trump has said,
3461.96s:  that is we're trying to replace a piece of government spending with private, you know, we're starting to,
3469.16s:  reshape the pie so that there's more private, more efficient private enterprise
3475.40s:  economy in less government, but it's a, you know, it's a queen marriage, it's got to turn around. But I,
3481.48s:  I mean, that, we've been asleep at the switch and certainly our presence for the last,
3486.60s:  you know, many years have been asleep at the switch. Reagan did some things in terms of
3492.12s:  bringing down the onerous tax rates, you know, he did it. I was there then, and it was viewed as
3498.36s:  an impossibility to, you know, we had, whenever they were, 80% marginal tax rates, maybe it was even 90,
3505.40s:  and he brought it down to, you know, into the 30s, ultimately, I think the 20s, you know,
3513.64s:  that was viewed as impossible, and he got both sides together and got that done. He obviously,
3518.52s:  you know, brought down the Zoe Union with what he did, you know, in terms of military spending and
3524.28s:  standing up to them. So, but beyond the other than that, I mean, for the last, you know, most of the
3531.24s:  last four decades, it's been, you know, this huge government largest and handouts. And meanwhile,
3541.32s:  we look like we're the strongest country out there, but there's a lot of hollowness within.
3546.52s:  And I think that's what this is our last great hope to kind of reverse that.
3551.88s:  And I do think, in kind of direct answer to you, I do think you will see the new generation of
3559.32s:  workers coming up, being more willing to forego college and say, I can make a good living,
3566.12s:  you know, in, you know, in whatever industries, you know, would it be a lot of manufacturing or other
3572.36s:  things? And that's the other thing Trump is doing is he's trying to, we used to be, you know, we used
3578.20s:  to kind of give lip service to this need to reshore, but he understood, or as people understood,
3585.80s:  if you look at the auto industry, we're assemblers. Yes, we're making cars in the country, but we're
3592.20s:  bringing the high tech part of that car in from other countries. He's looking to reestablish our
3598.04s:  engineering expertise and, you know, the higher end value of the car, the engines and all of that,
3608.28s:  I think all of that is something that nobody else even thought about and it's a good thing we are.
3616.12s:  Yeah, well, and it's a really big problem to solve. It's really interesting. And before you
3621.00s:  had mentioned a little bit about like what commodities might look like specifically a little bit
3627.32s:  about steel and aluminum, but in this new direction, let's call it, that things are going.
3635.16s:  What's your broader view on commodities? Because you also mentioned oil being positioned where it is,
3641.56s:  which has been actually really interesting to me. Talk to me about your lens with respect to
3649.64s:  commodities. Yeah, so my, as you know, my whole big picture of view is that we would have,
3657.48s:  you know, this last blow off in this cycle's economy where we would have commodities participate in
3663.80s:  that, have a run up in copper to $6 and probably seeing lots of commodities move up.
3672.52s:  But then the global bust would hit, mostly centered in next year, but maybe starting this year.
3678.92s:  And it would take, could take copper all the way down to a dollar even, certainly $2.
3685.32s:  And could then likewise with aluminum and steel and et cetera. So our starting point going into
3693.00s:  the next cycle is going to be much lower commodity prices. And I think that's not in most people's
3699.48s:  forecast. I mean, I think because nobody, not very many, looking for a bust.
3704.36s:  So I do believe the response to the bust will be this massive fiscal and monetary response to
3713.80s:  the tune. As I've said, a 20 trillion coming out of the Fed, you know, and likewise something similar
3720.84s:  coming out of the government to try to bail out a free falling worldwide financial system.
3728.28s:  I think, and again, all the central banks do the same thing. So I think, you know, you get out a
3733.80s:  couple of years from the bust and you're looking at rapidly rising commodity prices along with
3738.68s:  rapidly rising inflation. And it means you could see copper, which let's say against to six this
3745.32s:  cycle, maybe next cycle gets to 25, you know, with oil is, you know, 60 now. And it goes to 30 in the
3755.40s:  bust at the beginning of the next decade, I think it can be $500. So you're going to have huge run
3763.00s:  up in commodity prices, but not straight from here. So you have a couple of years here before
3768.04s:  people realize that, you know, the reshoring and everything we're doing is ultimately going to.
3775.08s:  Well, the reason you get the run up in the commodity is because you can have, as you industrialize
3780.84s:  America again, as we move more to an industrialized economy away from consumer because the
3786.68s:  consumers go to be flat on the back after the bus. As you move into more industry driving the economy,
3794.60s:  that's more commodity intensive. And, you know, if you're building factories, you're building
3799.88s:  plants, you are obviously demanding steel and aluminum and they're real that commodity.
3806.36s:  And it will, we won't have the capacity to satisfy. If you pump up the economy to the tune of
3813.40s:  20 trillion here, maybe 60 trillion more, why, whatever it is,
3819.48s:  unheard of. I mean, we did five trillion, it was unheard of in 2020. Before that, we had done, you know,
3826.60s:  3.7 trillion over the decade before that for the, you know, the great recession and
3831.96s:  the end response of the great recession. Before that, the balance sheet and the federal
3836.12s:  is $875 billion from 1913 to 2008 that it only grown to $875 billion. Now we're talking about it,
3844.84s:  maybe growing to 30 trillion in the matter of years. That is going to, that money goes into the pie
3854.44s:  and blows up demand. In this case, blows up industrial demand because you're trying to reshore. And
3862.04s:  you can't, you can't build capacity for commodities that fast. So you're going to have
3869.40s:  demand blow up very quickly, meaning in the matter of a few years, capacity to satisfy that
3875.48s:  demand takes maybe eight or ten years. So you're going to have a period for several years where
3881.16s:  demand is far outstripping your capacity to satisfy that demand. You know, anything that gives
3887.56s:  us that is price. So that's why you can get oil going from 30 to 500 or copper going from, you
3893.80s:  know, $2 to $25. And I'm just throwing numbers out there, obviously. But I think it's going to be
3901.40s:  unlike anything we've ever seen. One last question before I let you run, obviously the interest
3908.84s:  there is it would seem that before oil ever got to 500 that there would be either some sort of
3915.96s:  intervention or some sort of broad change in energy usage, meaning pivoting more to other
3926.36s:  fuel style. Now, as I think about your idea, what would prevent that is if it happened so fast
3933.16s:  that none of that could occur quickly enough in order to move. But I'm curious if that's even
3938.20s:  remotely close to accurate or what your view is there. You'll have lots of substitutions. For
3943.08s:  example, we're obviously re-jumping our restarting our coal industry. I think you're going to see
3949.96s:  that play a big role in trying to satisfy some of that because we're just not going to have the
3955.08s:  oil to satisfy the demand or natural gas, which is kind of, you know, everybody looks at it, you know,
3961.88s:  trades in a one to three or four dollar range or whatever, that could go to $50. I mean, you're
3967.40s:  just not going to have, you're going to have peak oil be a, you know, a topic again. You're going to have
3973.56s:  you know, for years we haven't really done a lot of deep water drilling, right? Right. Because
3981.24s:  of the meal, we were trying to certainly for several years we've been trying to re-emphasize
3990.04s:  fossil fuel energy. And, you know, and also oil was kind of in an area where they said we don't,
3998.52s:  we don't need to spend the extra money it takes to do deep water, you know, we're getting
4003.48s:  in in shallow oil, we're getting it here or there. There's going to come a time we're going to need
4007.96s:  every resource out there. And that's when, and price will justify the drilling, etc. And so,
4015.32s:  yeah, sure, as you move up, you can see more electric cars. That's what I've said forever is it's not
4020.28s:  that we won't see electric cars. We just shouldn't have had the government decide when we should do it,
4026.04s:  you know, let the markets determine when it's economically viable. Don't subsidize. You won't need
4033.08s:  to subsidize because it's going to come a time when it's across over where you say, hey, I'd rather have
4039.40s:  an electric vehicle. Even electric electricity is going to be expensive too, but, you know, there is
4047.32s:  a point where the market will solve all these things. The problem is the government always thinks
4052.12s:  they're smarter than everybody else and they want to engineer when things happen. They want to
4059.00s:  they want to be in charge of when things happen instead of laying the markets to determine that.
4063.72s:  The funny thing about that is obviously I live in California and the electric car thing
4069.40s:  really big deal here, right? Because a lot of people are doing their best to try to be
4073.96s:  environmentally conscious, but then every once in a while you'll get notices, you know, that
4079.80s:  don't charge your car or we can't, don't run your air conditioning if you're charging your car
4085.56s:  because the the constraints from electricity. So I chuckle because of exactly what you're
4092.52s:  talking about there. Last thing I want to wrap up with is when you look out as things sit right now
4102.36s:  into 2025, what are the top two or three things that you're keeping an eye on that you think as those
4111.00s:  things move, indicate progression or a shift in your overall thesis? Yeah, certainly the tariff policy,
4119.16s:  I want to see that then I'm right that we will at some point in the next month or two
4125.64s:  see a lot more movement towards negotiation. You know, if China continues to play hardball,
4133.00s:  we just continue to wrench it up tariffs, you know, then you can crack things and it can be a lot,
4140.04s:  you know, you certainly have to factor that in. So tariffs won or the whole process of
4147.24s:  negotiations won and the other one I think is kind of the it's going to really I think in fact
4156.60s:  exactly when the Fed comes in, not that I need the Fed initially, I mean as I've said,
4162.28s:  Rachel is going to come down without the Fed. So people will think that, you know, I think we
4166.52s:  could get a cut in May, no power, doesn't know it yet, you know, he's talking the other way,
4171.24s:  but I think we could get a cut in May. But we do or not, doesn't really matter to my thesis, but
4178.20s:  but I think watching jobs and whether that, you know, we start seeing that slowdown more,
4187.48s:  watching just the overall economic data, because that's where I think, you know, I am very confident
4195.24s:  that Powell is not watching the stock market. He's not worried about trying to prop up the market,
4200.20s:  but I think there is a crossover point where if the economy weakens, he can't sit on his hands
4205.64s:  any longer and say, hey, we're waiting on tariffs, he's going to have to come in. So I'd be watching
4210.60s:  just general economic data and certainly jobs, because that's what they're focused on. But jobs
4216.04s:  is a lag, or that's why I, again, the Fed drives me nuts, because they should know better than
4222.44s:  to use a lagging indicator as their sign of when to move on something that has a long lead time.
4229.24s:  Let's turn backwards thinking.
4234.60s:  When I look at the next couple of weeks, the tariff that you mentioned, the broader
4244.28s:  tariff policies seem to be just at an absolute highlight as a massive determiner of where things
4252.76s:  go from here. Now, the final thing I'm curious about, we've talked about this from the lens of
4260.76s:  expecting tariffs to be used as negotiation tools. What's your view if that is not the case?
4270.76s:  Or whatever reason? Let's just say that they end up staying or it just becomes more aggressive.
4275.16s:  What's your view of how things might progress if that ends up being the scenario instead?
4280.28s:  Yeah, then it comes down to how fast do things deteriorate? Because I think it is hitting the economy.
4287.24s:  How fast things deteriorate versus how fast does Powell recognize that he's got to abandon
4296.12s:  the worry about inflation and focus on the economy? Because I think that's coming.
4302.28s:  It's just a matter of coming in May, coming in June.
4305.64s:  Anybody that thinks there's a Powell put or a fed put on the market?
4312.84s:  He's made it very clear. He's not going to blow up things again, pump up the money again to
4319.16s:  support the market. But I think that entire F1C board, their whole mandate is, you've got to make
4327.80s:  sure you don't tank the market. You're our support. As much as he and Trump maybe
4335.48s:  not liking each other, I think he's still a sincere in knowing what his job is,
4341.72s:  meaning Powell with a sincere in that. I think he's got a pretty good solid
4348.84s:  group of economists there. Austin Gouldsby is a smart guy that has enough tendency to understand
4357.08s:  that we can't wait and sit on our hand until we see the heights of the eyes and recession.
4364.04s:  We've got to act soon. There are at least one that gets that. I think we'll be one of the
4368.76s:  ones pushing in that direction. He's held off to date. I keep saying, if you judge the fed on
4375.96s:  the base of the last year, you'd have to give him a high and give him my marks because
4382.68s:  they brought inflation down without causing a recession. The big question now is going forward.
4388.76s:  I've been very defensive of Powell, but defending him against a lot of critics,
4397.96s:  based on what we've done last year. But once criticized him, basically, he was more right than
4402.52s:  anybody in waiting. What he did last year was, it took some pressure off and it wasn't wrong
4409.96s:  thing either. But their rhetoric right now gives you the indication or gives you the impression that
4416.44s:  they are going to wait a long time before the ease again or that they are not in any hurry to
4423.00s:  ease. I think we're very close to a time where he should be doing it pretty aggressively. Whether
4428.28s:  that's May or June, if he thinks it's six months off, he's going to get bad grades going forward.
4435.88s:  Good grades up till now. The fed always has a history of staying the party too long on the
4442.52s:  tight side and creating a hard landing when it quit a bit of softening. That's my fear again.
4450.28s:  Yeah, Bonn rates right now are showing 90% probability of no change in May and then a 71.8%
4459.96s:  probability of 25 bips in June. As I say, their committee that
4469.88s:  has made play a mistake over the years, not just this committee, but the fed in general,
4476.28s:  at the FLC in general. I don't try to predict meeting the meeting what they're going to do.
4483.00s:  I do say what I think they should do, which is I think they should cut in May. Whether they will
4489.00s:  or not, I think again, if the economy is where it is today, they probably won't. If the economy
4494.36s:  softens from here and inflation continues to get lower, I think it is. I think they may reach
4503.32s:  a consensus to say, yeah, we could do probably won't be a half, but they could do a quarter.
4509.40s:  If it continues to tear it right, do it again in June. That's what people don't realize is
4516.12s:  neither and you're a trader. You get this. Neither the traders
4525.48s:  bet whatever it shows, 90% no cut. Neither that nor what Paul says today means a thing because it
4535.64s:  can change tomorrow. If you get some data that changes the traders view, you're going to see
4543.80s:  that number change a lot. If you see data that changes Paul's view or gets Paul's attention,
4550.36s:  he'll change between now and May 7th. I get people putting those numbers up to me every day and
4557.72s:  saying, well, what do you, you're saying they could cut in May and this is telling you every
4562.36s:  wrong. I'm going, I could care less what their point of view is at any point in time.
4567.80s:  Between now and May could be a long time if things change.
4570.84s:  It's funny you mentioned that because if you look at the bond markets pricing of federal fund
4577.40s:  rates, I always remind people when they say, well, you know, it said 90% probability of this and then
4582.28s:  this happened. I always tell them, look at the historic prices. You'll see how skits of
4587.40s:  frenic they are. So it shows just exactly what you're highlighting. It's actually really.
4592.52s:  It's a point in the time expectation. That's all it is. And Paul's a human being, yes, he has access
4598.68s:  to a lot of data, but he's shown that as the Fed always has been, their data dependent and
4606.44s:  that is really backward looking. So you know, you get some data changes as mine, he'll change his
4611.88s:  mind. Yeah, makes sense. So you've given us an overview of what's happened since last time. We
4618.04s:  spoke. You've given us what you're thinking. Things look like going forward over the next year.
4624.76s:  So is there anything else that you'd like to hit on before we wrap up?
4628.76s:  Yeah, just because we had a good kind of 100 miles above the surface talk today and that was good.
4636.60s:  Just to kind of bring it back to the numbers. Yeah, as I as I indicated before, I raised my SMP
4644.12s:  target for this is my prebuster meltup target, you know, the target at the top this year to 8,000 from
4652.76s:  7,500. I did that right smack in the middle of the, you know, the sell off, you know, when we were down
4659.32s:  below 5,000 on the SB, when there were else's lowering numbers, I raised them. My Nasdaq target
4667.32s:  had been 25,000. I raised that to 27,000. And I am very positive on semis, semis being
4677.48s:  obviously everybody's turned pretty negative on them and they've been hit hard. I have a 400
4684.04s:  target on SMH, which I think it was down 190 or they're about so more than the double from here
4689.88s:  and people think I'm crazy, but I think once this thing gets going, you're going to see semis lead
4694.28s:  to pack again. I also raised my target on the three things I raised my target on more
4703.48s:  than Nasdaq S&P and Gold. And I've raised my target from 3,400 to 4,000. So, no change in silver?
4712.76s:  Silver, because I had a 75 target, it's still quite a ways away. So, you know, down the road,
4719.00s:  if it proves itself, I might, but right now I've just kind of left that one where Gold,
4724.28s:  Gold's got the momentum and I think really 4,000 is very doable for this year. So that's
4730.92s:  pretty big adjustment for Gold. Definitely. Yeah, that's why I thought it was interesting,
4735.48s:  because I think it gives a little insight into your perception of the relationship between Gold
4740.36s:  and Silver because of the adjustment in Gold and Silver. Yeah, Gold is recognizing the momentum.
4746.04s:  If you look at it, if we run from, you know, the low 30s to 75, that's a, you know, more than
4753.32s:  certainly, well more than a double 120 percent or whatever. Whereas the move from 3,300 to 4,000,
4760.44s:  you know, is whatever that is, you know, 20, 20, some 1 percent. So, I do expect Silver to very much
4768.04s:  outpace Gold from here. Now, Silver and Gold, Silver gets a bad unwrap because everybody thinks it's
4773.56s:  not done anything from the lows of a couple of years ago, you know, from 2022 lows. Gold and Silver
4781.00s:  until very recently when Gold had this last bird had traded up, had pretty much doubled, almost
4787.16s:  doubled each from that low. So the perception he has at Silver stood still, Gold's had a nice run,
4794.52s:  right? Well, it's part of that because Silver is more volatile and typically does outperform,
4800.84s:  and not perform yet. It's basically been performing almost in line, but with a lot more volatility.
4806.84s:  I think from here, you should see Silver really start to be the leader, but Gold will still have
4812.36s:  obviously some nice run up to 4,000. That leads to one more question, sorry, but the recent drop
4820.84s:  in Silver, I thought that was very curious compared to what Gold's done over the last couple
4825.80s:  weeks. What did you make of that move specifically? Unfortunately, I think Silver is obviously more
4832.28s:  economic, and so it's probably somewhat a statement. Copper dropped from five bucks down to four
4839.80s:  bucks or whatever. I think the economically sensitive metals got hit harder, and I think there were
4844.84s:  some of these. They were going to tear off, they didn't end up tear offing Silver, I don't think,
4850.52s:  but it's just the more volatile metal, and as people risk off, they sold those things that they
4858.84s:  were most nervous about. That's what, and that's really when you talk about that sell off in the
4864.76s:  market, and you could easily, and I saw many of the technicians get very negative, and many
4870.44s:  astragists get very negative because of the breaking of somebody's key levels. But when you really
4876.44s:  step back and realize that was a lot of force liquidation, margin calls, and such. And the rest of it
4885.32s:  was basically just plain panic, risk off. I'm getting out because I'm not sure what's happening.
4894.36s:  This is a crazy policy. We've never seen this before. And because everybody did it in a
4899.40s:  concentrated way, yeah, he broke some, I think you're going to break them on the upside just as quickly.
4908.04s:  But you know, that's what I kept saying that whole week that we were just getting hammered.
4913.24s:  I just said you got to let the dust out. I think that's just panic.
4917.16s:  I see. Yeah, I follow you there. Well, as always, really, really interesting talking to you,
4924.20s:  getting caught up on. I lost you. Oh, sorry, I still got you. Can you see me? Yeah, no sound.
4934.04s:  I think we are back online. But I was just saying it is always, it's really interesting
4939.16s:  understanding your lens of like what's happened, what you're expecting to see. So thank you for
4945.48s:  taking the time to walk us through that. Now people can still reach out to you on X. I'll make
4951.08s:  sure to throw your correct link in the notes below for them to check out. They can
4956.04s:  I assume still DM you for your quarterly newsletter. Is that still accessible to everybody?
4961.64s:  Once details on the letter, just DM me. Beautiful. And then anything else that you'd like to direct
4968.20s:  people towards? No, I just think we're in for a heck of a next, you know, between now and the end
4975.88s:  of summer, I think we're not going to be, you're not going to have a relaxing summer on the beach
4980.12s:  just way I put it. It could be fun, but I think it's going to have people, people in our business
4985.88s:  are going to want to stay next to their desk, so next to their computers, I think. So.
4990.36s:  Yeah. Well, I fully agree with you there. It's been very eventful so far. So fully expect to
4995.96s:  continue, but thanks again for coming to Hangout and as always, I'm sure we'll connect again in a
5000.52s:  few months and we'll see how things trend. Yeah, thanks. Great conversation, I think. Thank you.
5006.44s:  Beautiful. Yeah.
