0.00s: What's up, bowliers. Welcome back to the Outlar podcast. I'm joined again with my friend
6.32s: David Hunter. This is, I don't even know how many times we've talked now. It's got to
10.24s: be like half a dozen plus. At least. Yeah. Yeah. We've had a really fun time exploring
16.08s: the markets and understanding the way that you're looking at things. And as we were literally
19.72s: just talking about before we press record here, we are now yet again. I feel like every
24.60s: time I talk to you, we're in these really weird times. It's either a global pandemic or
28.12s: it's some sort of financial crisis and here we are again. So welcome back looking forward
32.28s: to chatting. Yeah. I agree to you. And yeah, that we're dull moment here. Yeah. So I guess
39.32s: to start off, one of the big things that we had been talking about, obviously your your
45.48s: broad thesis. And before we get into the details of the broad thesis, how it's playing out
49.60s: and those kinds of things, I was giving you a little bit of context on a general curiosity
53.92s: I have. And again, we approach markets from different perspectives, right? You're a very
58.24s: macro long term big, big picture view. I'm very trade oriented day to day looking to just
63.96s: find what opportunities I can capture. Now, one of the things I find so interesting about
70.20s: markets is that they are constantly evolving. And there can be a lot of periods where you
74.36s: have an idea and then some sort of new piece of information enters the system that wasn't
79.20s: necessarily expected and then the idea changes. Now, you're kind of experiencing that to,
86.00s: I mean, just a massive effect, not even looking at an individual stock. We're talking a massive
92.28s: global system. And I want to understand the way that you think about how you're formulating
99.64s: these ideas. And for example, the melt up into the bust, that's a really big idea with
106.28s: very specific criteria that you've ironed out and you've shared previously. But it seems so
111.96s: susceptible to new pieces of information entering the system. So how does that play into your
119.00s: broader thesis? Are the underlying conditions so powerful that as new pieces enter the system,
124.32s: they're kind of secondary? The things are ready set or does it behave differently?
128.36s: Yeah, surprisingly, I mean, my forecast has not changed the logic. It'll be surprised. It's changed
135.32s: in a more bullish direction, actually. I've raised targets. So surprisingly, you know, as big as the
143.64s: tariff's hour, as big as what's going on right now is my macro underlying macro thesis, the underlying
154.04s: fundamentals and underlying thesis that is getting me to these extreme forecasts both in the
161.72s: up and down are not really changed a lot by what's happening. Part of that is because I'm making
170.84s: some assumptions that, you know, the tariff situation will play out and it won't be what we see now.
179.80s: I mean, you saw in the last two or three weeks the reaction. And, you know, your crowd reacts
189.64s: instantly to that and goes to the worst case, right? And then if the tape joins them, they just
196.12s: really go crazy on the downside. You know, I'm stepping back and saying, what the dust settle? It's not,
203.80s: this is not what you're going to see over the next several months. You know, he's negotiating.
210.36s: Doesn't mean we won't have tariffs, but they're not going to be these tariffs. And, you know,
215.32s: St. Louis heads will prevail, etc. And not the Trump isn't sincere, but because he will keep
223.16s: tariffs if he has to. But ultimately, he's holding most of the cards because we are the, you know,
230.04s: the big market that everybody depends on. And we take that away from them with the tariffs.
235.72s: Their economies are going to go to hell a lot faster and a lot deeper than ours is. So, so I'm,
241.00s: that kind of helps a lot to not overreact to what is going on. And meanwhile,
249.00s: in the markets and on the street, most people are overreacting or it might be overreacting,
255.24s: but certainly reacting in a big way. And that only because the other part of me is, yes, I'm
261.16s: long term macro, but I'm also contrarian. And that just feeds into my stuff. Senments
267.80s: nothing disparish in a long time. I mean, this is as barish as you get pretty much.
272.60s: People are just assuming we saw the top. We're going down. And, you know, people are playing
279.96s: leapfrog in terms of how low we're going to go. So when I see sentiment at that level, it just,
286.60s: you know, it actually increases my bullishness. And in this case, because of the way it happened,
294.12s: and because of where everybody's position, I raise targets.
299.00s: So that obviously begs the question. The natural question is if you're thinking about, or if you
304.92s: raise the targets, which we'll get into, what's the driver behind it, assuming there obviously
311.48s: needs to be a catalyst to cause that. And we might even come under the guise of, well,
317.00s: even if let's just use best case scenario where tariffs just go away. That kind of just puts
324.36s: back to where we were before they went down. That's not like some sort of massive positive
329.24s: catalyst, unless it's combined with a lot of better, you know, agreements that are made.
334.68s: So, yeah, tariffs go away on our side, perhaps, you know, even the 10th or maybe, but
342.28s: 10% or not 10%. So we'll be back down from these, these extra tariffs. The other side
349.48s: is going to have to give up a lot of tariffs. So I mean, we already have heard that Vietnam's
354.68s: willing to go to zero. If we go to zero, there's other trade barriers that cause, you know,
360.28s: there's more to be done. But I think what you're going to see in Mexico and Canada and in the
367.32s: Asian ring and in Europe is, tariffs may not go away, but they're coming down. Those countries,
375.24s: you know, again, Trump is playing poker and he's got most of the cards. He's got the good cards and
381.64s: I think Besson was the one that said, you know, China is playing with the paratuse. So, you know,
386.68s: a lot of this is really, Trump, if he didn't have a strong hand, this would be foolish.
393.96s: But we are the ace in the hole in terms of the markets. These other countries, economies go to
398.60s: hell, particularly export countries like Germany or like China, you know, and even some of the
407.96s: third world countries like Vietnam, you know, they can't afford to just kind of play a hard
414.52s: ball and say, yeah, you want to do that, I'll do that. Well, the problem is we can survive much more
421.96s: because we don't have, we're not really depending on your markets, but you are depending on our
426.84s: markets. So, I think that's one of the keys. Now, what I would say is that the thing that
435.64s: drove my forecast at the beginning, from the beginning is, I believe rates are coming down,
442.04s: I believe inflation is coming down, I believe the economy is slowing and that's not bearish
448.60s: at the bullish. You know, the economy, people, we may be in recession already, but we're certainly
454.60s: heading for recession. And people think that's a sign that the market's peaked and we sell off.
460.36s: I go, no, the market will go up into that recession as long as it's viewed as a
465.32s: containable recession. You know, if it turns into something harder land, much harder landing,
470.92s: then that may end my thesis. But at this point in time, you're not seeing any of that.
477.24s: And I think the odds are that this low economy will certainly help the bond market in as
482.68s: quite of the, you know, the history that last week. You'll see the bond market rates come down,
490.20s: the bond market control interest rates, not the Fed. So rates will come down and I think come
494.36s: down quite substantially. You know, I'm still calling for a sub three percent by some time
499.96s: this summer. That doesn't mean by June, but certainly, you know, by August or September,
505.72s: you could be looking at sub three percent, maybe even two and a half percent on the 10 year.
510.84s: That's a huge amount of ease without any Fed, you know, we're having this tip for tad or a battle
517.32s: between Powell and Trump. Neither one likes the other one. And, you know, if it's, people get
525.24s: scared of that because I think it's, you know, real problematic. I keep repeating. You know,
531.64s: the bond market's in charge of rates. The bond market is, you know, the vigilante is
536.44s: everything we want to call them. The investment firms that are buying bonds when the economy
541.64s: slows are going to, are going to buy bonds more bonds because the economy is slowly. And I'm not
547.40s: worried about China bailing out on their, our tragedies. I'm not really worried about Japan.
553.72s: Ultimately, and we saw, you know, we were at 455, 457, you know, several days ago and we're,
561.40s: you know, we came all the way back down to Florida quarter or thereabouts and now we're up in the
566.68s: four thirties. You know, rates are coming down. They're not going up. So all this hysteria about that
573.08s: just adds to the pessimism out there. And I call that a wall of worry that means people have acted
579.40s: on their fears, which means they're positioned defensively whether they're in cash or short,
585.16s: short tragedies or, you know, very defensive stocks. That means the next move will be out of that
591.64s: defensive position, out of that, it's buying power for the future. So you'll see, you'll see them come
599.40s: back into more aggressive positions when it does clear. At least that's what I believe. So,
604.68s: and, and before the tariffs, you know, was that lower rates, lower economy, lower inflation
611.40s: scenario that was going to drive us to the S&P 7500 now on saying S&P 8000.
619.16s: So I, and I think one of the last times we spoke, I actually think it was around now that you
624.28s: are expecting the, the bust to be getting close to underway, but it sounds like with the new
631.32s: revision to the upside things have shifted a bit. What were the, the primary drivers of the shift
640.52s: as far as you see it? Yeah, I'm actually my, my bust scenario has not, or timing wise, I've not
646.68s: really changed. It could get pushed out certainly. That's just the thing if this thing drags out.
651.40s: I'm basically, I came into this year saying probably a fourth quarter event, and I'm still saying
657.56s: it could start the fourth quarter. Doesn't mean it has to. It could, you know, wait until next year,
664.20s: but I haven't changed a lot of timing because of this because it's dependent on how fast this
669.32s: all, you know, works its way through. But the market, in my opinion, that very violent cell
675.16s: law of bottoms, you know, down at 48 or 900 on the S&P, and we've had a pretty good runoff of that.
683.72s: There's a lot of people out there expecting a retester, new lows. It's possible. I don't think
689.16s: it's likely. I think we're starting our, you know, starting our next leg up. And so, you know,
696.52s: it's not going to be recognized as that for a little while because I think people are still
700.52s: worried about that second leg or the second shoe to drop. But you could turn around a couple weeks
707.56s: and say, hey, we're back there to the highs. You know, or we're back, you know, we're back at the high
713.64s: 5,000. So, so I don't think time wise, you know, we might have lost a month.
719.88s: Got it. Now, what do you make of the relationship with bonds and equities here? Because obviously,
726.68s: for a while, they became highly correlated. Then it seemed like they were starting to resume a normal,
731.88s: less correlated relationship than more correlated. The overall behavior between the two's been really
738.44s: interesting. So I'm curious your thoughts on the interplay. Yeah, it's, I, I mean, I continue to expect
744.92s: that bond and stocks are going to have big rallies into the summer. So it's not just the stock market.
752.04s: I think the bond, as I said, rates are going to, you know, 10 years going to come down under 3%.
756.68s: That's a big rally from here. I think, you know, slowing economy, lower inflation helps stocks,
765.80s: but it also helps bonds. I just don't buy into this. It was a, it was a, it was a weird panic, I thought,
772.44s: that we all said we pushed the rate back from sub 420 back up to 450 on the 10 year.
779.40s: And people were panic. Then I said, look, two weeks ago, we were at 440. And I had talked about in,
786.92s: you know, earlier in March, that it was setting up as a head and shoulder top in rates. So you,
791.80s: on the 10 year, it looked like you were, you know, you had a gap at 440. And you had a,
798.12s: a right shoulder that, if you did the perfect right shoulder, was at 450. And bonds got up to about
805.40s: 437, 38 and took off. It went down under 420. So I said, well, it didn't have to fill gap and it
811.96s: doesn't have to, you know, it's not, it doesn't have to be a perfect right shoulder. So maybe we had
817.24s: that correction in rates. And it's now moving down. Well, we got down to almost 4%
824.20s: based on the tariff news and everything. And then it shot right back up to that 440, 450.
831.56s: And everybody's panicking and I go, it's really, you know, it's 10 basis points above where it was
839.08s: a week and a half ago or less than a week and a half ago. You guys are acting like this is,
843.64s: the move is from 4. It's not. We did a round trip. We just went down and back up, it was kind of a
849.08s: surprise move down to 4. And surprise moved back up into this. And then it pushed above that 450 to,
856.44s: you know, that morning to like 457 and people were panicked and saying, China's dumping bonds.
863.96s: This is a sign that there's some kind of a credit event out there. You know, people's
868.44s: imaginations ran wild. Well, you know, you let it settle even that day. It got back down under 450
875.56s: and, you know, it was down at 4.27 or something yesterday. So I just think it's much more about
883.16s: people's emotions than it is about reality out there. I think what I see is a bond market that
890.84s: bottomed, you know, several months ago and just working its way higher rates. So obviously,
896.84s: topped, they're working with good people. Forget, we're at 5% on the 10 year, you know, several months ago.
903.32s: So we're still in the downtrend and rates. It just had some volatility within that period.
909.56s: I see. Now, when Trump first announced the tariffs leading into it, he was pretty straightforward
916.92s: about a lot of what he was talking about doing. And then when he launched the tariffs, the curve ball
922.60s: obviously was the 10% on everything. That wasn't really message ahead of time very well or at all.
929.48s: And that, you know, the market was like, okay, this is quite a bit different than what I thought.
935.08s: When you're looking at the relationships between the various economies that are out there
941.88s: against the tariffs as they've been set out, what are your thoughts on the game of chicken
949.64s: that's now happening? Because we can see some countries to your point, definitely Vietnam. A lot
954.44s: of those smaller countries have definitely started saying, okay, we'll play ball. And then there's
960.28s: other countries that are saying like China, okay, let's play. And there's also the artifact of now
968.68s: Russia and China are even talking about doing natural gas deals together. Obviously, part of that
973.56s: is just being played up to add volatility to everything. But nonetheless, there's absolutely
978.60s: something to be said about other economies getting closer together, XUS. So how does that all play out
986.44s: in your view? Yeah, well, first of all, I do think there are maybe 40 or 50 countries that are
993.08s: coming to the table. And I think we are going to see deals announced over the next several weeks.
999.08s: And as those deals get announced, even if they're not the big players, it starts to look like,
1005.16s: hey, there's a master plane here that's working. So, obviously, the two main players here that
1011.00s: are problems are China and Europe or the ECB. And also, they're not the ECB, but EU. And
1021.32s: I think the EU's starting to come around. They're not certainly not playing hardball to
1025.88s: disagree that China is. China was always known to be number one, the primary target, and number,
1032.84s: and the biggest issue we have is with, obviously, China trade. And number two was likely to be the
1041.16s: one that would play the hardest ball. They would fight us the most. So all I can say right now is
1048.28s: I believe where the market is versus where I think it works out. The market, I think, is far too
1056.68s: pessimistic about it. I think standard heads are going to prevail on both sides. It's in both
1062.68s: our interests. Again, people, it's almost like investors want to think of this in terms of all
1069.88s: or none. Trump wants all trade with China knocked off. And we want to bring all, well, everything
1080.36s: back gone short and all that. It's at the margin. You're trying to get this thing turned around at
1086.04s: the margin. And he's right in what he's trying to accomplish. I hear all the time. Well, I agree
1092.68s: with what he's trying to do, but I don't agree with those tactics. The problem is, if you didn't in a
1099.08s: more reasonable way, China would never come around. I mean, you've got to do this and the nice,
1106.04s: the good thing for our side, I think, is you've got a president who has a backbone who means what he
1113.56s: says and who will, you know, he's willing to play to an extent, not always, but to an extent,
1121.56s: you're willing to play long ball. You know, it's not everybody seemed to think he was going to buckle
1127.08s: with the stock market. And, you know, he has to, you know, actually it was good news to see that
1133.48s: he came to a little bit on things and gave them the next stuff. Yeah, with the text stuff,
1138.12s: even before that, the 90 day, you know, grace period. It's realistic. I think he's got good people
1145.72s: around him. People want to portray him as a, you know, mad man, but you know, best and snowman
1151.16s: man, he's got, you know, I think he's maybe the best treasury secretary we've had. And although
1158.60s: Navarro, maybe the mad, the mad scientist in this design in terms of what we're doing, he's absolutely
1166.92s: right. You know, we, we've, this is four decades in the coming. And you just have to do something
1173.72s: pretty drastic to turn it around. So, but I think cooler ads will prevail ultimately. I don't know
1180.12s: what that will look like. I think it will accomplish some of our goals, but not all of Trump's goals.
1188.12s: But I think in the end, what you're going to have, if you fast forward a month, baby,
1193.24s: month or a month and a half is you're going to have what looks like for your trade around the
1198.44s: world, lower tariffs from our trading partners allowing us to have more access to their markets.
1205.32s: Not free access. I don't think we're going there, probably. And, and you're going to be able to look
1211.32s: and say, you know, a month ago or a month and a half ago, I thought everything was going to crash.
1218.28s: We're going to have, you know, this was in 1930s. You know, this is smooth hauling. We are going to
1225.24s: protectionist policies. And now I step back and realize we're freer in trade than we were coming
1232.36s: into this year. We're, we're seeing deals left and right of people who are recognizing and make
1238.68s: sense to come and build plants in this country. And, and both China and the US have agreed to
1245.24s: something. I think that I think that let's all that weight off the shoulders of the market and then
1251.80s: it rises as aggressively. And then you've got in there short covering that will play. And, you know,
1259.32s: when you shift from sentiment that's, you know, based on dire outlook to sentiment that says,
1266.84s: hey, things are, you know, may not be, you know, perfect, but things are looking better than they
1274.68s: were coming into this. You know, it's a big, big move, a big gap between where you were position
1282.68s: or where you need to be position. And that's why markets, you know, get it up.
1288.12s: Now, one of the things I've seen mentioned about the approach with tariffs so far, which I do
1296.20s: find interesting is there's a really good argument, I think, that the path taken so far definitely
1305.00s: albeit aggressive does lead to more things happening more quickly. Then there's the other part
1313.40s: of this argument that says in doing that, you cause a tremendous amount of disruption, distrust,
1320.52s: and other countries might look at it as the US is less reliable. Do you think that there's
1326.92s: an element of that at play here and if so, what impact? Yeah, for sure. I mean, I would think if I
1333.40s: were on the other side of this, I'd be pretty, you know, I'd be pretty pissed off and, and, uh,
1339.08s: feel like, you know, and again, there's that narrative's out there around surrounding Trump anyway. So,
1344.52s: you know, there is easier to buy it. Something that's already out there that, you know, he can't be
1349.96s: trusted. He's, you know, you'll do these things. But part of that is the element of unpredictability that
1359.08s: I think causes them to have to come to the table if you were predictable. And maybe China thinks
1365.48s: he is. Maybe that's why they're playing hardball. But I think of it the longer this space, they're
1370.04s: going to say, hey, he's not, he's not folding like we thought he would. And if you look at some of
1375.32s: the other countries, I think that again, it comes down to their economies. I think we are more resilient
1383.56s: given given that we are less dependent on exports than Germany, that Europe, China,
1391.00s: than a lot of these countries. And ultimately, I think that's what will get negotiations going. And
1397.56s: I think they are going, obviously, the tougher ones are going to be the harder ones to get to the table.
1403.72s: Right. Well, and it's also been a big part that every time I've seen asked of him how he would treat
1410.84s: things like car vows and stuff like that. And he is made it pretty clear that he's open to discussion.
1418.84s: So I think that tips that had a little bit in a way from the from the jump that he's not necessarily
1425.88s: looking at maintaining this longer term as you've already generally pointed out. Now, the effect
1432.68s: of reshoring some of these industries, how does that in your view play into the broader economy?
1441.32s: Because one of the interesting things I've seen discussed is this conversation around GDP, GDP
1446.52s: slowing, cutting government spending, government spending is a big part of GDP. And then you have
1451.00s: the conversation of is that even GDP? And you know, it's like these different levels to the
1457.40s: discussion. But the reshoring element is really interesting to me. Because again, you know, I have
1461.16s: a military background and from that, I like that for a lot of reason because as anybody who studies
1468.44s: war, it genuinely is one through logistics. If you have really good fighting forces, but they run
1474.36s: out of what they need, it doesn't matter. They could be really great dudes, really capable, but you
1478.76s: can't shoot nothing. So I find from a defensive perspective, it very interesting and pertinent
1486.12s: COVID gave us a little bit of a preamble on what this could look like. But from an economic lens,
1492.44s: how does the reshoring element fit into your broader assessment of the economy? What kind of impact
1498.12s: does that? Yeah, first of all, I think you're dead on and that's where I think Wall Street's kind
1502.84s: of short-sighted is Trump, if this were purely economic and not national security, then you know,
1512.84s: you could say, wow, you're making big bets here. And why did we need to do that? You know, yes,
1519.56s: there certainly we would like more industry back here, et cetera, but you know, you're really
1525.32s: disrupting a lot to get that. And but national security almost demands that we do this. We could,
1532.12s: as you well know, we could not do a World War II again. We have, we don't have the steel capacity,
1538.28s: we don't have the manufacturing capacity to convert everything over to wartime and roll out the
1546.52s: military hardware we need. I mean, it's just not possible. Now, I know electronics is a bigger
1551.32s: part of it today. We can probably do that. But I think national security is a big part of what he's
1558.60s: why he's doing this and why he says we don't. And we can't stretch us out, it says to be done now.
1565.00s: Re-sharing itself from an economic standpoint, yeah, I mean, you and I know a lot of these
1572.20s: commitments are going to take years to build, right? And frankly, you don't know whether you can
1579.80s: trust even some of the commitments because some of them will drag your feet and hope he's gone in
1584.44s: three years, three and a half years and never build the plant here. But I think they're going to hold
1591.56s: people's feet to the fire a lot, I think, to make sure this stuff is, you know, you've started your
1597.48s: plant, you're getting going. It's still going to take time. But I think they can move pretty quickly
1603.80s: in terms of some of this. And I think he's got plants to kind of incentivize that even.
1608.92s: But remember, my forecast is that we're heading into recession and then that will morph into a global
1616.60s: bust. I'm not expecting re-sharing to jumpstart this economy and get us out of this, you know,
1625.48s: in the next year. I think re-sharing will play a big role in the recovery after the bust.
1631.88s: It will play a big role, I think, in the meltup in terms of the concept of re-sharing and the
1638.92s: dollars that are coming in here now. But the actual production that comes out of re-sharing and
1644.28s: the restoration of our industrial base is really a 2027, 830 type thing. But markets discount ahead,
1658.44s: concepts do help drive markets. So I think the re-sharing will help the meltup, but the actual
1667.56s: results of re-sharing, I don't think we see for a couple more years.
1672.68s: What is the piece of information, the market effect, the occurrence, whatever the actual trigger
1681.72s: ultimately ends up being that transitions us right now from this relatively historic pullback
1688.28s: actually in terms of speed and velocity. This is right unprecedented. And from a trading
1694.92s: perspective, it's fascinating because a big thing that I trade as volatility and you can track
1700.04s: how volatility has changed over the past decades, which is a whole other thing. But going back to
1708.84s: the actual trigger event that leads to moving from where we are now into the meltup. What is that?
1719.24s: Yeah, so first of all, that sell off. I mean, if I were a technician, and I've seen playing
1724.12s: technicians that are in this position, I'd be barriced, right? I mean, we broke pretty significant
1730.44s: trend lines, and there's all kinds of reasons why you can look down. And yet, it never, I didn't
1735.88s: fall through a bit because it, again, just like 2020 was kind of a, never saw that before, you know,
1743.32s: 35% down in three weeks, and yet I turn really bullish then. This same thing here is the sentiment
1751.80s: turned so was negative going into it and turned so negative that I said these breaks are,
1760.04s: you know, I don't want to call them false breakdowns, but they really were very quick and very
1765.80s: temporary. And so that's why I was not surprised to see the rebound that we've seen. And I think it's
1772.28s: a real rebound, not a, you know, a relief rally. So that, first of all, it'd be easy to be bearish,
1779.88s: but you know, from a technical standpoint, so I understand why it has caused so many people to jump
1786.52s: on that bandwagon. However, you know, I guess maybe it's by 50 years of doing this or whatever,
1795.08s: you know, these, these technical rules are broken all the time. You know, if you get caught in a
1800.52s: dogmatic view of how charts work and, you know, if you get this break, it means this, you're going
1806.84s: to, you're going to get burnt because for every, for every rule, there's, there's going to be an
1811.48s: exception, particularly in a period like this. And you had to step back and look and say, why did we
1816.68s: get this break? What is that break doing? It's really causing people, you know, it was almost
1824.44s: a way to manufacture fear, you know, that all you had to do was break that 5,500 on the S&P,
1830.76s: and you knew that there was another big step down coming. And, you know, you got it the next day,
1835.64s: or the next couple of trading days. Same thing, you know, obviously Russell looks terrible from a
1841.64s: technical standpoint, and yet I'm pretty bullish on it. So I think there are times when you have to
1846.60s: learn that yes, technical analysis is, is a important tool, but don't, don't make it your
1854.84s: Bible. You know, don't think it, you know, sometimes it can be a fake out. So on the other side,
1860.92s: in terms of the bullishness, I think as we always find, you know, it starts moving up like we're
1867.64s: seeing now just from, it feels like really fralley, and because, you know, people start moving
1873.96s: away from their, their worst fears. And then as take moves up, more people jump on. So I think
1887.40s: are you chasing the fly or what? No, I'm looking at the charts here because it's really interesting.
1893.48s: I'm watching the difference between the eminies, Nasdaq, and Russell. I actually had a follow-up
1897.56s: question for you. But I didn't want to interrupt you. Yeah, that's okay. So yeah, so I think we,
1903.16s: we're moving into that period where if it keeps going here, that momentum works, you know,
1909.72s: works in reverse. All of a sudden, the tape moving up is going to first cross some short covering,
1916.28s: which we've already seen some of that. But there's a lot more that can happen. And then as tape
1921.16s: continues, it just drags people back into the bullish side. You know, no matter what, momentum
1930.36s: you know, causes sentiment. You know, people really react to the tape and they've react very
1936.68s: negatively to a negative tape. I think it won't be that long before you start seeing that turn
1941.88s: around and people have to remember, you start from the lower left move to the upper right,
1947.64s: on sentiment too. So you start at the bottom with deep bearer sentiment. That's a bullish thing when
1955.64s: sentiment is this deeply bearish. And it doesn't move straight to bullish. It kind of moves less
1963.00s: bearish, more neutral and then bullish and then extreme bullish. So I think you'll see that play
1969.56s: out over the next three to six months. Now, when I'm looking at the major indices here, I mean,
1978.20s: from like a three month perspective, all of them are still pretty firmly down sloping. There was
1984.60s: that bear recovery on the ninth of April. But then it's kind of been stalling and starting to fall
1992.04s: past that. So are you viewing this just bouncing back and forth that we're kind of doing now,
1999.16s: since it's not like plummeting back down, but it's also not shooting up here. Do you view this more
2003.80s: as like a consolidation thing? And then if so, what then becomes the catalyst to lead to the meltup?
2011.56s: Yeah, I mean, I'm not a trader. So I don't, I don't pretend to know what the next week's going to
2016.28s: look like. And so, you know, if I were betting, I would bet slightly bet that we're probably up
2024.12s: from here that you get a day or two of this, you know, make it look like it's rolling back over,
2028.52s: but it doesn't last. But if it if it if it did roll back over and retested, that wouldn't that
2034.12s: wouldn't change my ultimate opinion either. So, yeah, I'm not caught too much in the very short
2040.04s: term. My guess is, you know, I'll let the tape tell us. But if if this thing reverses back up here
2045.48s: in the next, you know, either tomorrow or that early next week, this would just kind of a couple
2051.64s: day, what what you're also getting is not just obviously tacked pebbles. What you're getting is
2056.52s: news events, you know, the minute right comes out on Trump says something else, you know,
2062.84s: outcome the sellers again saying, oh, see, this is where we're not out of the woods. So, you're
2068.44s: going to have volatility based on, you know, whatever he tweets or says, you know, standard.
2077.16s: Yeah, definitely. One one of the things you mentioned earlier was referencing the 2020
2083.56s: bear market and then the eventual rally out of there. I think obviously the thing that comes to
2088.60s: people's minds with that is had the Fed not intervene and did kind of historic measures.
2096.28s: There's a good chance that could have led to a pretty big problem. Yeah, I was bullish. I was bullish
2101.00s: in March of 2020 because of the Fed's response, you know, was $5 trillion. Not we didn't know 5 trillion
2109.72s: initially, but there was a lot of money coming in along with a lot of programs from from Congress. So
2116.92s: that that was what gave me a confidence that I don't think we're going to see that here by any
2121.56s: means. I think we're in a different place for different reasons of bullish, but yeah, you're lacking,
2128.12s: you're lacking anything close to that right now. There's no urgency on the part of the Fed.
2133.56s: You know, if anything, the Fed's still talking a long game of, you know, we want to see what
2137.88s: happens with the tariffs before we come in. I don't, you know, I really ignore Fed commentary
2145.48s: in between meetings. You know, it's, they're doing two things. They're trying to send the message and
2152.52s: Waller came out and talked more like eases and far away. And the next day, Paul is pretty much
2158.28s: putting him back in his place with, you know, we're not anywhere near thinking that. So I think they
2166.68s: want to convey a message that they're not in hurry to ease that they're, I think they're wrong
2172.76s: in terms of feeling like they're in a kind of a great spot where they can pivot either way,
2178.20s: depending on what, you know, what they get. To me, they're not really as, as is typical of the
2185.56s: Fed. They're not really getting the leads and lags. You know, they get lip service to leads and
2190.68s: lags and understanding those leads and lags to policy. But the way they act, they're caught
2197.32s: looking at backward looking data and extrapolating forward until proven otherwise. And, you know,
2203.88s: with leads and lags that are, you know, six, nine, 12, 18 months long, depending on what, you know,
2209.40s: what you're leading to, you know, you can't play this backward looking, you know, we're data
2216.76s: dependent. And that's what they're doing. I think it's pretty easy to look at what the tariffs
2221.88s: are doing to companies and to worldwide trade and say, there's going to be disruption in the economy,
2230.12s: not initially because initially you're getting numbers that are probably people buying ahead of
2234.92s: the tariffs, right? So you're getting, you're getting some, like, you have good retail sales.
2241.00s: And you're seeing some things that say the economy looks pretty good. You can't go by those numbers
2245.96s: because those are basically pulling from the future. I think once we get out of month or two,
2253.08s: numbers could not crater, but be down quite a bit. I think, you know, I very definitely think
2258.84s: we could be in recession if we're not already before this quarter is out. So, you know, for the fed
2264.84s: to kind of sit on their hand and say, oh, we're in a good place. We don't, you know, it's the
2269.96s: economy's okay, jobs are okay. We could just kind of take our time and I think if you delay here,
2279.00s: you're going to have to play catch up and that catch up will help my belt.
2284.04s: Now, one of the things I'm so curious about here is the relationship of the recession because
2291.88s: typically at the onset of recession, markets do generally react negatively to that. And before
2297.80s: you had mentioned that you'd view the recession actually as a potential bullish catalyst. So then
2304.92s: I'm trying to understand the timeline as you're seeing it with the involvement of the current state,
2312.12s: the meltup and recession potentially in like the next quarter. What does that timeline actually
2317.56s: look like? Not again, specific dates, not specific months, but just the relationships.
2322.28s: Yeah, so probably standard way people would look at things is that the market leads economies,
2329.16s: right? So that the market would typically top out six months ahead of the economy maybe and
2334.92s: start discounting the recession or six to nine months ahead of that. We're nowhere near. I mean,
2341.56s: if we're in recession this quarter, obviously the market just topped out in March.
2348.68s: I'm looking at it as it's and this is not kind of what we see typically in our cycles,
2357.80s: but we're not in a normal cycle. I'm looking at there could be a period here where and I think
2365.08s: there will be a period here where it looks like soft landing or slow down mild recession.
2372.52s: And the feds responding to it saying, okay, now we got the ease we're seeing that.
2378.68s: But we're not in a hard laying scenario. In other words, a narrative will still be soft landing,
2383.24s: soft landing accompanied by lower inflation and maybe a lot lower inflation.
2389.56s: And keep in mind that the narrative out there just a week ago and I think for some people still
2396.36s: is that inflation is ticking up, not down, right? Everybody's worried even the fed worried about
2401.08s: inflation. Well, I think inflation is going down. True inflation, the measure they measure is
2407.24s: 1.3% I think they're below the 2% target. Housing is roll over because of these high mortgage rates.
2415.32s: And you've got oil down at $55. I mean, I don't know who's looking at higher inflation here, I think.
2424.04s: And again, the one thing that's pushing everybody to higher inflation is saying tariffs are
2428.44s: inflationary. Tarrifs aren't inflationary. They cause a one-time bump in prices, but they also
2433.80s: cause a big dip in demand. So it doesn't, it's not sustainable inflation if that's the story.
2442.28s: So I think the feds got it wrong. Those are worrying about inflation to have it wrong.
2446.68s: And they're within very short time, I think they're going to come around to wow inflation.
2451.48s: Actually, moving towards that 2% target pretty fast. So you have lower inflation,
2459.08s: soft landing, even though it may be a mild recession. And finally, the fed at our back, you know,
2465.72s: fed back cutting rates, maybe even pumping a little money. And that happening at the same time
2473.16s: that the tariffs are starting to get normalized. The tariff policy is starting to get normalized.
2477.80s: And people say, oh, it's not what we were fearing. You get all that in a concentrated period of
2484.20s: two or three months and you can have a rip-roinded market. I see. Yeah, I can follow the thought
2490.68s: process there. What are your thoughts around the, you were saying tariffs may or may not be
2497.72s: inflationary depending on the effective demand? But what do you think about elasticity's involvement
2504.76s: in that? Because with how broad the tariffs are, they're absolutely are going to be components
2511.80s: that are captured that will have different measures of elasticity and the ability to either
2517.96s: experience a decrease in demand or just accept heightened cost. Yeah, it's hard. I guess I've kind
2524.68s: of put it on the side line a bit and said, until we get clarity on what really is going to come
2531.40s: with, I still think the primary story is negotiation. And if anything moving towards free or trade,
2540.20s: not more protectionist trade, you have to do this to get there. But I'm just kind of at this point
2548.12s: saying, let's not jump to the negative side when the probabilities really suggest at least for me
2556.20s: that more likely we're going to see negotiations and things. Maybe very sincere about liking tariffs
2566.52s: as a revenue razor. But I truly think his primary use of tariffs is to bring the other trading
2574.60s: partners to the table and say, enough's enough. We've handed you our markets for free for too long.
2581.96s: You have two choices. You can either run into real resistance. We can do what you did to us
2588.52s: or we can both agree that you have to lower your tariffs so that we get more access.
2594.84s: That I think is the more likely outcome of this, not everywhere maybe. But I mean, I don't get
2600.60s: Canada. Canada, Canada, Mexico are kind of a different story in some ways. But when you look at it's
2607.88s: like there's no way that we're going to be where we are right now in terms of hurting each other.
2615.72s: It doesn't make sense. There's got to be a true negotiation in both those countries where they
2622.68s: come around to some extent and understand. We're not taking everything away from you, but we
2627.72s: can't have it the way it is where you're terrifling us to the point where we don't have much in
2634.44s: your markets. And yeah, you have access to our markets. So, and he's obviously trying to accomplish
2640.60s: some other things there too. So I just think I guess I have some faith in Trump as a negotiator.
2648.36s: Well, and I think another data point that that
2652.04s: supports pieces of that is I don't know if you saw this thing with the the Texas and Mexico like
2658.36s: this water deal. Are you familiar with that? There's I've never heard of it before either, but
2664.84s: and I don't want to speak to incorrectly about it. Just at a high level, I recently was
2669.48s: reading about it, but there's an agreement where as we were dividing like the real grand and what
2674.68s: not that there's a certain amount of water that is owed to us by Mexico that we to Texas that we
2682.36s: historically haven't collected on. And I think it's coming up this year. It's like every decade or
2688.04s: every five year time frame, a certain volume is due. And we've never bothered with it really.
2695.40s: And Trump is now saying he wants to collect on that water for Texas. So I think not, you know,
2704.12s: aside from the actual details of that, I think it does highlight part of what you're talking about
2709.96s: more broadly. Whereas there's this global negotiation going on where we're trying to actually
2716.36s: reestablish footing on a lot of different things. And yeah, that very much seems to be at least part
2722.92s: of what's at play here. And I think, you know, I don't think we can make light of this act that
2730.60s: what do you call TDS or just a dislike or distrust of Trump or what have you? It pervades Wall Street,
2738.28s: it pervades obviously Washington. It pervades the media. Well, wait, no, I'm saying the opposite.
2745.64s: I'm saying the perception of him because people believe that he's polarizing or believe
2752.68s: or just don't like him or his style. He's a very much New York style in your face, you know.
2760.28s: And his whole negotiation style is I play hardball and then we back off from the
2765.88s: you know, see our deal. I start with my most extreme negotiating position and then we work
2776.44s: forward from there. But but all that plus all the everything else that surrounds the politics
2783.40s: from 2016 on and particularly the left view of him, but certainly a lot of Wall Street bought into
2790.12s: that and a lot of, you know, population bought into it. That's all part of why I think that
2799.64s: everybody sides with, you know, we really have a strong reason to be doing what we're doing.
2805.72s: We've given away our country for 40 years in a lot of ways. It benefited Wall Street,
2811.56s: but it didn't benefit the middle America. And that's truly what he's trying to accomplishes.
2815.64s: Bring back the jobs for middle America. That should be a something that people are, you know,
2822.60s: getting behind and very much supportive of. But because of TDS or whatever you want to call it,
2828.68s: there's this natural tendency to doubt that he's doing anything good that he knows what he's
2835.32s: doing that he I think he I think he will go down to history as maybe a more successful president than
2841.48s: Reagan and accomplishing bigger things and Reagan. But he's not going to have he's going to have
2847.56s: to prove that because so many people doubt it. But I think that's why people instead of this
2853.56s: country kind of getting behind what we're doing, they jumped to they always assume that we have
2858.36s: the weekend and the other sides going to play us or whatever. We're we're in the driver's safe
2864.84s: seat in a lot of ways because of our markets. And Trump understands that. I mean, we are we are the
2870.52s: market to the world. And so, you know, there are problems. I'm not saying that it's it's easy
2877.16s: street here, but I'm saying a lot of I think the perception of Wall Street is because a lot of
2882.36s: Wall Street is just like Washington. They don't like him or they don't trust him or they have TDS
2888.20s: and you know, he's got some good sword and good people that back him. You know, I certainly do,
2894.84s: but I do think if you were to take a poll a lot of what's you know, what's the rhetoric out there?
2901.32s: What's the the sense out there? It's coming from personality more than you know, and dislike
2908.92s: of that personality more than it is reality. Sad that contributes to the bearishness,
2915.24s: contributes to the doubts. And I think the picture is probably a lot better than that.
2922.12s: It's one of those things that's so fascinating because it's multi-variant, right? There's a lot
2927.08s: of different angles you can take because the the concept of him trying to bring back the middle
2934.68s: class to reestablish it in some of these different ways totally can see that view. And then there's
2938.68s: also the view of well, if you're a person that's looking to retire in the next six months,
2944.28s: you're terrified right now because of this damage that has been done that directly affects you
2951.80s: unfortunately because it is the the middle class and the lower classes that don't have obviously
2957.96s: the excess disposable income to be able to survive. Those kind of drops and be able to you know,
2963.56s: live off of the same style. So it's one of those things where it's just such a fascinating
2970.12s: culmination of to your exact point personality timing issue, press sands depending on what matters
2976.28s: to the individual because no matter what as you've kind of pointed out here, there's no easy way
2985.08s: to reflate America without causing massive disruption. It's just if you're going to try to
2992.68s: and frankly, I think it's naive to say we can go along the way we've gone because Wall Street
2999.00s: still doing okay and you know, more than people have you know, equity in their homes and stuff.
3006.92s: Meanwhile, you know, we're handing advantages left and right to China that we won't be able to
3013.00s: make up grounded. You know, we're really at that. It's kind of the same thing as last November in
3018.36s: the election. It truly was, I think a do or die election. If if it had stayed, I don't want to get
3026.76s: too much into politics, but if it had stayed with the Democrat candidate, it was very much moving
3033.72s: us closer and closer to globalism, closer and closer, you know, the globalist agenda is really a
3040.44s: weak U.S. agenda. You know, looking for a way and we would be at some point we were heading towards
3048.44s: the British Empire, the Roman Empire. And this is our last best chance to reverse 40 years of
3054.76s: bankruptcy. It's not all Democrats. The Republicans, you know, with the exception of Reagan, the
3060.04s: Bushes were part of that globalist agenda too. And this was really a one-time chance and it's a
3069.80s: short window. I mean, we don't even know if he's going to have a window beyond the first two years
3075.24s: because of election, your election, mid-term elections. So he doesn't have a lot of time and he's
3081.48s: trying to accomplish a lot of things. He's you know, it's not just deregulations. Another big
3085.88s: story we haven't talked about that will be an offset to some of the, you know, the negatives of
3092.44s: tariffs. D-Rex is a big deal in terms of, so you have to kind of look at his whole agenda and
3098.68s: realize- Also taxes. It's taxes. And whether he gets to everything he wants, probably not, he is
3108.60s: a pro-growth president. And we should be excited about that. And unfortunately, it is a negativity
3116.52s: towards him, you know, and frankly, Wall Street's kind of bent their book too because they'd much
3123.40s: rather have things as they were. They were fat and happy. And you know, Main Street was getting hit
3130.12s: pretty hard. They're still kind of wanting to stay fat and happy and not worried about Main Street.
3135.72s: Well, thank god we have a guy in there. It's a populist president. He's very much- he's sincere
3141.80s: about that. He really understands middle America has been hit hard for decades. And it's time to
3148.60s: bring that back. But for, you know, for two reasons, economically for them, but also national
3154.84s: security reasons. Another broad question I had with respect to just the economy and the inputs to it.
3164.20s: My wife and I, we like to travel a lot. We actually just got back from Ireland. And we notice
3170.76s: when we're in a lot of these other countries, when you go into convenience stores, when you go into
3175.88s: gas stations, when you go into shopping centers, you notice that it's like mostly local people that
3184.12s: are just working those, you know, lower level jobs, those base level jobs. And a lot of places in
3190.68s: the US still do that. But then there's also a lot of places that don't or a litany of different
3196.44s: reasons, living wages and stuff like that. The question I have with respect to the economy and
3203.00s: employment is what effect does that have that like the the base middle class quote-unquote, which is
3211.48s: also this esoteric term that ranges widely what people consider middle class. But what effect does
3218.68s: that have when the the living wage and the lifestyle that those kind of people would want to be able
3225.24s: to work for seem to not either be available, not desirable, both of those I think exist to a
3232.04s: pretty big degree to the individual? What effect does that have on the economy? And then I'm curious
3237.56s: about the reshoring effect here. Like how many Americans are going to be actually really excited
3241.96s: to go to these kinds of jobs potentially? Yeah, it's going to it's probably going to have to evolve
3247.24s: you know as always it's not going to be instant. Yeah, we're you know we're giving up college,
3252.44s: we're going to you know work in a factory or whatever. It'll evolve then the jobs are going to be
3258.36s: very different robotics who's going to play a role etc. So you know I think technology is going
3263.48s: to be a big part of the new job landscape too. But I'll answer a little different way which is
3272.84s: part of part of his deregulation is banking. I am argue for one time because I started in banking
3281.96s: in up you know in Indiana where it was countywide branching you couldn't you couldn't have a
3287.40s: statewide bank you know you you're largest being the first you could go with your county lines.
3292.92s: So we were largest in the bank they started with was in my college town it got me into the
3297.00s: investment business you know I had it was a two-man shop I was a second guy so but it was great
3302.28s: training and it was and we had a lot of because it was North West Indiana we had a lot of
3307.88s: Chicago and Indianapolis bankers in the bank you know they wanted to be out of the way for the city
3313.08s: and you know had expertise but we're you know so I was exposed to pretty good people but
3319.32s: but then we had you know over the course of the next 30 years you know deregulation of banking
3326.60s: and you know from that to statewide and then the you know nationwide banking so we had the
3332.20s: Bank of America's and the the Chases and the City Banks etc that became nationwide you know big
3338.84s: banks and some of the big superregions. What we lost though in the process is a lot of the
3347.32s: banking is branches of these big banks in the in the smaller cities and towns you lost that
3356.52s: president of a local bank that had you know was in the road reclaw and was you know friends with
3363.16s: all the businesses in town and you know a lot of the what they used to call the three C's which
3370.12s: included character you know credit character I forget what the third one was but basically when
3374.84s: they were making loans they were making loans to their neighbors and now it's you know once we
3380.76s: went to this you know full on big bank model everything was a formula you know you you had people
3391.40s: taking taking a credit application but they didn't care who you were they just say you don't
3396.28s: meet our criteria you know we're not lending that much right now so you're not you're not going
3402.04s: to get it you know I think our smaller cities lost their heart and soul as a result of that so
3409.16s: going back that way I think will be a big part of it the other thing I'd say in relation to
3415.64s: so you're right I do think you know because of these other countries and you see locals they're
3422.36s: working in their towns and they're basically it's it's like we used to be the other thing I will
3428.52s: say is that without government spending without the huge blow up in our government the huge
3434.68s: growth of our government over the last 30 years everybody would realize our standard living has
3441.08s: been dropping but it was held together because of lots of handouts lots of entitlements lots of things
3450.12s: and unfortunately in the meantime we're not recognizing that we lost a huge part of our
3457.72s: true productive economy and what we're doing here Trump has said it is we're trying to replace
3464.04s: a piece of government spending with private you know we're starting to you know
3469.00s: reshape the pie so that there's more private more efficient private enterprise
3475.32s: economy in less government but it's a you know it's a queen marriage got to turn around but I mean
3481.72s: that we've been asleep at the switch and certainly our presence for the last you know many years
3488.04s: have been asleep at the switch Reagan did some things in terms of bringing down the
3492.84s: own risk tax rates you know you know I was there then and it was viewed as an impossibility that
3500.04s: you know we had whenever they were 80% marginal tax rate it maybe it was even 90
3505.40s: and he brought it down to you know into the 30s ultimately I think the 20s you know that was
3514.12s: viewed as impossible and he got both sides together and got that done he obviously you know brought
3519.08s: down Zoe you with what he did you know in terms of military spending and standing up to them
3525.80s: so but beyond the other than that I mean for the last you know most of the last four decades it's been
3534.20s: you know this huge government largest and handouts and meanwhile but you know we we look like we're
3542.04s: the strongest country out there but it's there's a lot of hollowness within and I think that's what
3547.80s: this is our last great hope to kind of reverse that and I and I do think in kind of direct
3554.76s: the answer to you I do think you will see the new generation of workers coming up being more
3561.64s: willing to forego college and say I can make a good living you know in you know in whatever
3569.88s: industry you know would there be a lot of manufacturing or other things and that's the other
3573.88s: thing Trump is doing is he's trying to we used to be you know we used to kind of give lip service
3579.88s: to this need to reshore but he understood or as people understood if you look at the auto industry
3587.80s: were assemblers yes we're we're making cars in the country but we're bringing the high tech part of
3593.48s: that car in from other countries he's looking to reestablish our engineering expertise and you know
3602.44s: the higher end value of the car the engines and and all of that I think all of that is
3610.44s: something that nobody else even thought about and it's as a good thing we are
3615.16s: yeah well and it's a really big problem to solve it it's really interesting and before you
3621.00s: had mentioned a little bit about like what commodities might look like specifically a little bit
3627.32s: about steel and aluminum but in this new direction let's call it that things are going what's your
3635.64s: broader view on commodities because you also mentioned oil being positioned where it is which
3641.96s: has been actually really interesting to me talk to me about your lens with respect to commodities
3650.52s: yeah so my as you know my whole big picture of you is that we would have
3657.48s: you know this this last blow off in this cycle's economy where we would have commodities
3663.00s: participate in that have a run up in copper to six dollars and probably seeing you know lots of
3670.20s: commodities move up but then the global bust would hit mostly centered in next year but maybe
3677.24s: starting this year and it would take could take copper all the way down to a dollar even certainly
3684.12s: two dollars and could then likewise with aluminum and steel and etc so that we're our starting point
3692.44s: going into the next cycle is going to be much lower commodity prices and I think that's not in most
3698.92s: people's forecast I mean I think because nobody's not very many to look at for a bus
3705.40s: so I do believe the response to the bus will be this massive fiscal and monetary response to the
3713.96s: tune as I've said a 20 trillion coming out of the fed you know and likewise something similar
3720.84s: coming out of the government to try to bail out a free falling financial world-wide financial system
3728.28s: I think and and again all the central banks doing the same thing so I think you know you get out a
3733.80s: couple of years from the bust and you're looking at rapidly rising commodity prices along with
3738.68s: rapidly rising inflation and it means you could see copper which let's say it gets to six this cycle
3746.12s: maybe next cycle gets to 25 you know with oil is you know 60 now and it goes to 30 in the bust
3756.36s: at the beginning of the next decade I think it can be five hundred dollars so you're going to have
3762.44s: huge run-up in commodity prices but not straight from here so you have a couple years here before
3768.04s: people realize that you know the reshoring and everything we're doing is ultimately going to
3775.08s: well the reason you get the run-up in the commodity is because you can have as you industrialize
3780.84s: America again as we move more to an industrialized economy away from consumer because the
3786.60s: consumers go to be flat on the back after the bus as you move into more industry driving the economy
3794.60s: that's more commodity intensive and you know if you're building factories you're building plants
3800.92s: you are obviously demanding steel and aluminum and and then real that commodity and it will
3807.96s: we won't have the capacity to satisfy if you if you pump up the economy to the tune of 20 trillion here
3814.44s: and maybe 60 trillion more wide whatever it is unheard of I mean we did five trillion was was
3822.36s: unheard of in 2020 we before that we had done you know 3.7 trillion over the decade before that for
3829.48s: the you know the great recession and in response to the great recession before that the balance
3835.40s: in the federal take 175 billion from 1913 to 2008 that it only grown they earned 75 billion now we're
3844.12s: talking about it maybe grown to 30 trillion and in the matter of years that is going to that money
3852.60s: goes into the pie and blows up demand in this case blows up industrial demand because you're trying
3859.88s: to reach or and you can't you can't build capacity for commodities that fast so you're going to have
3869.40s: demand blow up very quickly meaning in the matter of a few years capacity to satisfy that demand takes
3876.36s: maybe eight or ten years so you're going to have a period for several years where demand is far
3882.20s: outstripping your capacity to satisfy that demand you know anything that gives end is price
3888.60s: so that's why you can get oil going from 30 to 500 or copper going from you know $2 to $25 and I'm
3896.20s: just throwing numbers out there obviously but I think it's going to be unlike anything we've ever seen
3904.28s: one last question before I let you run obviously the the interest there is it would seem
3911.24s: that before oil ever got to 500 that there would be either some sort of intervention or some sort of
3920.28s: broad change in energy usage meaning pivoting more to other fuel style now as I think about your idea
3930.28s: what would prevent that is if it happened so fast that none of that could occur quickly enough
3935.72s: in order to move but I'm curious if that's even remotely close to accurate or what your view is
3940.52s: there you'll have lots of substitutions for example we're obviously re re jumping our
3945.96s: restarting our coal industry right I think you're going to see that play a big role in trying to
3951.88s: satisfy some of that because we're just not going to have the oil to satisfy the demand or the natural
3957.80s: gas which is kind of you know everybody looks at it you know trades in a one to three or four dollar
3964.04s: range or whatever that could go to $50 I mean you're just not going to have you're going to have
3969.40s: peak oil be you know a topic again you're going to have you know for years we haven't really
3977.40s: done a lot of deep water drilling right right because of the meal we were trying to certainly for
3984.76s: several years we've been trying to re-emphasize fossil fuel energy and then
3994.12s: you know and also oil was kind of you know an area where they said we don't we don't need to spend
3999.48s: the extra money it takes to do deep water you know we're we're getting then in shallow oil we're
4004.68s: getting it here or there there's going to come a time we're going to need every resource out there
4010.12s: and that's when and price will justify the drilling etc and so yeah sure as you move up you
4017.40s: can see more electric cars that's what I've said forever is it's not that we won't see electric
4022.52s: cars we just shouldn't have had the government decide when we should do it you know let the
4027.24s: markets determine when it's economically viable and don't subsidize you won't need to subsidize
4033.80s: because it's going to come a time when it's across over where you say hey I'd rather have
4039.48s: electric vehicles even electric electricity is going to be expensive too but you know there
4047.16s: is a point where the market will say we'll solve all these things the problem is the government
4051.72s: always thinks they're smarter than anybody else and they want to they want to engineer when things
4057.96s: happen they want to they want to be in charge or when things happen instead of laying the markets
4062.20s: determined that the funny thing about that is obviously I live in California and the electric
4069.00s: car thing really big deal here right because a lot of people are doing their best to try to be
4073.96s: environmentally conscious but then every once in a while you'll get notices you know that
4079.80s: don't charge your car or we can't don't run your air conditioning if you're charging your car
4085.56s: because the the constraints from electricity so I chuckle because of exactly what you're talking
4092.84s: about there last thing I want to wrap up with is when you look out as things sit right now
4102.36s: into 2025 what are the top two or three things that you're keeping an eye on that you think as
4110.60s: those things move indicate progression or a shift in your overall thesis yeah certainly the
4118.12s: tariff policy you know want to see that that I'm right that we will at some point in the next
4123.96s: month or two see a lot more movement towards negotiation you know if if China continues to
4132.12s: play hardball we just continue to ratchet up tariffs you know then you can crack things and
4138.12s: and it can be a lot you know you certainly have to factor that in um so tariff one or the whole
4146.28s: process of negotiation is one and the other one I think is kind of the
4154.28s: it's got a really I think impact exactly when the Fed comes in not that I need the Fed initially
4161.40s: I mean as I've said Rachel is going to come down without the Fed so people will think that you know
4165.88s: I think we could get a cut in May no Powell doesn't know it yet you know he's talking the other way
4171.24s: but I think we could get a cut in May um what do we do or not doesn't really matter to my thesis but
4178.28s: but I think watching um jobs and whether that you know we start seeing that slow down more
4186.52s: um watching just the overall economic data because that's where I think you know I I am very confident
4195.24s: the Powell is not watching the stock market he's not worried about trying to prop up the market
4200.28s: but I think there is a crossover point where if the economy weakens he can't sit on his hands
4205.64s: any longer and say hey we're we're waiting on tariffs he's gonna have to come in so I'd be watching
4210.68s: just general economic data and certainly jobs because that's what they're focused on
4215.56s: but jobs is a lag or that's why I again the Fed drives me nuts because you know they should
4221.64s: know better than to use a lagging indicator as their sign of one to move on something that has a
4228.20s: long lead time that's just backwards thinking when I look at the next couple weeks
4240.60s: the tariff that you mentioned the the broader tariff policies seem to be just at an absolute
4248.20s: highlight as a massive determiner of where things go from here now the final thing I'm curious
4257.32s: about we've talked about this from the lens of expecting tariffs to be used as um negotiation tools
4266.60s: what's your view if that is not the case for whatever reason let's just say that they end up staying
4273.24s: or it just becomes more aggressive what's your view of how things might progress if that ends up
4278.52s: being the scenario instead yeah then then it comes down to how fast do things deteriorate
4284.92s: because I think it is hitting the economy how fast things deteriorate versus how fast does Powell
4292.60s: um recognize that he's got to abandon the worry about inflation and focus on on the economy because
4300.20s: that's I think that's coming it's just a matter of is it coming in May is it coming in June
4306.28s: um you know anybody that thinks there's a power put or a fed put on the market no he's made it
4313.40s: very clear he's not he's not going to blow up things again you know pump up the money again to
4319.16s: support the market but I think that entire F1C board their whole mandate is you know you've
4327.40s: got to make sure you don't tank the market yeah you're you're our our support so as much as
4332.68s: as much as he and Trump maybe not liking each other I think he's still a sincere in knowing what
4339.88s: his job is uh meaning Powell with a sincere in that and I I think he's got a pretty good solid
4348.76s: group of economists there in Austin Gouldsby I think is is a smart guy that has has enough
4355.64s: tendency to understand that I've got a you know we can't wait and sit on our hand until we see
4361.88s: you know the whites of the eyes of recession we've got to act soon or at least one that gets that
4366.92s: and I think we'll be one of the ones pushing in that direction he's held off to date and I think
4373.72s: I keep saying you know if you judge the Fed on the base of the last year you'd have to give him a
4379.16s: high and give him my marks because you know they brought inflation down without causing a recession
4385.80s: the big question now is going forward you know I'm not I'm not worried that I've been very um defensive
4394.20s: of Powell then defending him against a lot of critics based on what we've done last year but
4400.36s: let's criticize them basically he was more right than anybody in waiting and they know what
4405.56s: he's they did last year was you know took some pressure off and wasn't wrong thing either but
4412.36s: they're rhetoric right now gives you the indication or gives you the impression that they are
4418.52s: got away the long time before the ease again or that they are not in any hurry the ease and I think
4423.72s: we're very close to a time where he should be doing it pretty aggressively so whether that's
4429.32s: mayor june and I think if he thinks it's six months off I think he's going to get bad grades going
4435.24s: forward good grades up till now but you know the Fed always has a history of staying the party too long
4442.28s: on the tight side and creating a hard landing when it quit a bit of softening and that's that's my fear
4448.60s: again yeah bond rates right now are showing 90% probability of no change in May and then
4457.80s: as 71.8% probability of 25 bips in june so yeah yeah as I say I their group their committee that
4470.60s: you know has has made play a mistake so early years not just this committee but the Fed in general
4476.28s: for the FLC general I don't try to predict meeting the meeting what they're going to do I do
4484.20s: say what I think they should do which is I think they should cut in May whether they will or not I think
4489.88s: again if the economy is where it is today they probably won't if the economy softens from here and
4495.64s: inflation continues to then lowers I think it is I think they may they may reach a consensus to say
4504.68s: yeah we could do probably won't be a half but they could do a quarter and then you know if it continues
4510.12s: to turn it right do it again in june yeah that's what people don't realize is neither and you're a
4517.32s: trader so you get this neither the traders bet you know whatever it shows 90% no cut neither that
4531.00s: nor what Powell says today means a thing because it can change tomorrow you know if you get some
4538.28s: data that that changes the traders view traders view you're going to see that number change a lot
4545.72s: if you see data that changes Powell's view or gets Powell's attention he'll change between now
4551.56s: and it may sell it so you know I get people putting those numbers up to me every day and saying well
4558.20s: what do you you know you're saying they could cut in May and this is telling you it's wrong I'm
4563.40s: I could care less what their point of view is at any point in time it's the you know between now and
4568.44s: May could be a long time if things change it's funny you mentioned that because if you look at the
4574.12s: bond markets pricing of federal fund rates I always remind people when they say well you know it's
4580.20s: said 90% probability of this and then this happened I always tell them look at the historic prices
4586.20s: you'll see how skits of frenic they are so it shows just exactly what you're highlighting it's
4591.88s: exactly really it's a point in time expectation that's all it is yeah and Powell's a human being
4597.72s: yes he has access to a lot of data but he's he's shown that as the Fed always has been
4603.88s: their data dependent and they're and that that is really backward looking so you know you get some
4609.88s: data changes his mind he'll change his mind yeah makes sense so you've given us an overview of what's
4616.76s: happened since last time we spoke you've given us what you're thinking things look like going
4623.00s: forward over the next year or so is there anything else that you'd like to hit on before we wrap up
4628.68s: yeah just because we we had a good kind of 100 miles above the surface talk today and that was good
4636.60s: just to kind of bring it back to the numbers yeah at least as I as I indicated before I raised my
4642.04s: SMP target for this is my prebuster meltup target you know the target at the top this year to
4651.72s: 8,000 from 7,500 I did that right smack in the middle of the you know the sell off you know when we're
4658.76s: down below 5,000 on the SP when there were else is lowering numbers I raised them my Nasdaq target
4667.40s: had been 25,000 I raised that to 27,000 and I am very positive on semis semis being obviously everybody's
4679.16s: turned pretty negative on them and they've been hit hard I have a 400 target on SMH which I think
4685.72s: it was down 190 or they're about so more than the double from here and people think I'm crazy but
4691.64s: I think once this thing gets going you can see semis lead the pack again I also raised my target on
4700.68s: the three things I raised my target on or the Nasdaq SMP and gold and I've raised my target from 3,400 to 4,000
4709.88s: so no no change in silver silver because I had a 75 target it's still quite a ways away so
4718.44s: down the road if it proves itself I might but right now I've just kind of left that one where gold
4724.28s: gold's got the momentum and I think really 4,000 is very doable for this year so that's pretty
4731.16s: big adjustment for gold definitely yeah that's why I thought it was interesting because I think it
4736.04s: gives a little insight into your perception of the relationship between gold and silver because of
4741.64s: the adjustment in gold and so yeah gold is recognizing the momentum if you look at it if we run from
4748.52s: you know the low 30s to 75 that's it you know more certainly well more than a double 120% or whatever
4756.60s: whereas the move from 3,300 to 4,000 you know is whatever that is you know 20 20 some 1% so I do
4766.28s: expect silver to very much outpace gold from here now silver and gold silver gets a bad
4771.72s: you wrap because everybody thinks it's not done anything from from the lows of a couple of years ago
4777.40s: you know from 2022 lows golden silver until very recently when gold had this last bird had traded up
4785.56s: had pretty much doubled almost doubled each from that low so the perception he has at silver stood
4792.92s: still the golds had a nice run right well it's part of that is because silver is more volatile and
4799.16s: and typically does outperform and not perform yet it's basically been performing almost in line but
4804.84s: with a lot more volatility I think from here you should see silver really start to be the leader
4811.24s: but gold will still have obviously some nice run up to 4,000 that leads to one more question sorry
4818.92s: but the the recent drop in silver I thought that was very curious compared to what gold's done
4824.84s: over the last couple weeks what what did you make of that move specifically unfortunately I think
4831.08s: silver is obviously more economic and so it's probably somewhat a statement I mean copper dropped
4837.64s: from you know five bucks down to four bucks or whatever I think the economically sensitive
4842.84s: metals got hit harder and I think there were some they were going to tear off it they didn't
4848.28s: end up tearing silver I don't think but but it's it's just the more volatile metal and as people
4855.24s: risk off you know they sold those things that they were most nervous about that's what and that
4862.20s: really when you talk about that sell off in the market and you know you could easily and I saw
4868.20s: many a technician get very negative and many strategists get very negative because of the breaking
4873.56s: of somebody key levels but when you really step back and realize that was that was a lot of
4879.64s: those forced liquidation margin calls and that such and and the rest of it was basically just plain
4888.60s: panic um risk off you know I'm getting out because I'm not sure what's happening you know this
4894.68s: is a crazy policy we've never seen this before and and because everybody did it in a kind
4899.88s: of straight way yeah he broke some I think you're gonna break them on the upside just as quickly so
4908.04s: but you know that's what I kept saying that whole week that we were you know just getting hammered
4913.24s: I just said you gotta let the dust settle I think this just panic I see yeah I follow you there well
4920.76s: as always really really interesting talking to you getting caught up on
4926.04s: everything lost you oh sorry I still I still got you can you see me yeah no sound
