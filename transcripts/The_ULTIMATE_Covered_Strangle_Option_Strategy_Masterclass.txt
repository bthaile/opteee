0.00s: hands down my favorite option strategy
2.34s: is the covered strangle this video is
4.32s: going to go into exactly why and it's
6.42s: for two reasons it's extremely adaptable
8.22s: to most market conditions and once you
10.32s: create a sound strategy around the
13.38s: coverage strangle option structure it
15.36s: allows you to benefit from different
17.46s: Market forces in different market
19.98s: conditions and I'll explain exactly why
22.08s: that's the case in just a minute so
24.00s: what's up everybody Eric here welcome
25.86s: back to all the outliers and a huge
27.90s: shout out to the patreon members and
29.52s: YouTube members you guys make creating
31.44s: content like this possible for me so
33.60s: thank you guys and if you enjoy my
35.10s: content consider signing up helps me a
36.96s: lot with that let's get right to it
38.70s: executive summary so for those that
40.32s: don't know I'm really big into
41.40s: organization and I will throw a link in
44.04s: the notes Below on the concept of
45.90s: trading plans and strategy outlines this
48.84s: is kind of the excerpt of a strategy
51.24s: outline that walks through how I view
53.22s: the strategy how I intend to deploy it
54.96s: the executive summaries like the acid
56.52s: test it's just an overview of what it is
58.32s: succinctly so the coverage strain angle
60.54s: is designed to maintain Market exposure
63.60s: so I trade the covered strangle in
66.18s: almost every single Market Condition
67.68s: it's primarily a bullish strategy the
71.40s: market exhibits positive drift over a
74.40s: long term time frame so it allows me to
76.44s: expose myself to that but we can enhance
79.50s: the Buy and Hold return because one of
81.48s: the downsides of Buy and Hold is when
84.00s: the market goes down you lose out on a
86.40s: lot of opportunity and Buy and Hold
87.84s: because you just essentially have to get
89.64s: it Buy and Hold but in this case we can
92.64s: use options around a otherwise Buy and
95.46s: Hold strategy to really amplify the
97.62s: return potential so what's the setup
99.48s: here what does this thing actually look
101.04s: like well real simple really it's going
103.02s: to start with a cash secured put then
105.00s: it's going to have long stock and then
106.44s: it's gonna have a covered call let's
107.64s: take a quick look at each of those by
109.26s: themselves first if we pull up the
111.00s: platform you can see a trade that I have
113.22s: on right now in iwm which is a coverage
115.68s: triangle and let's take a look at each
118.08s: of these individual legs so first we
120.96s: have the cash secured puts cash secured
123.42s: puts will have limited profit potential
125.76s: it's defined at the onset of the trade
127.68s: and technically undefined risk down to
129.78s: zero then we have the covered call this
132.96s: part is actually really important first
135.12s: it's going to start with the long stock
136.80s: right so long Equity you've seen this
138.48s: before it's just a positive sloping line
140.52s: for anybody that's looking at this chart
141.84s: saying what the hell is this this is
143.46s: literally just a risk profile but it
145.68s: shows you your profit and loss at
147.54s: different uh stock prices so the y-axis
149.88s: is our p l and then the x-axis is the
152.94s: price in the underlying so long stock
154.86s: it's just upward sloping right you
156.54s: dollar for dollar you move with the
157.98s: underlying now right now I'm long 800
160.14s: shares of iwm at
162.32s: 181.94 so covered call typically looks
166.02s: like this where if we have long 800
169.14s: shares we would be short eight calls
171.90s: against it and notice how we cap our
174.18s: upside potential now right now my
177.00s: covered call actually looks like this
178.80s: notice how it has unlimited upside
181.44s: potential this is for a very particular
183.06s: reason I do not sell short calls to Long
186.48s: stock at a one-to-one ratio typically
188.52s: we'll get into different circumstances
190.08s: on what ratios you would want to use
191.70s: when but the guiding feature here is if
194.10s: I'm long 800 shares at 181.94 and I'm
197.70s: short six short calls at 182 which is
201.18s: above my basis I have 200 shares that
204.00s: are uncapped that's why I do not have
206.22s: capped upside potential one of the
208.38s: largest drawbacks of the covered call is
211.32s: capped upside potential we accept some
213.54s: money up front but then we give up our
215.88s: upside potential and a lot of times the
218.10s: stock will run and then you're like well
219.72s: damn it I'm missing out on a lot of
221.52s: gains for a little bit of a credit up
223.32s: front say something God damn it you're
225.66s: on television this allows us to create
228.30s: balance so in this case if I want to
231.24s: unwind the position sure I might sell
233.76s: eight short calls against the long 800
236.16s: shares in the hopes that all 800 get
238.56s: called away and I'm okay with that but
240.30s: in other instances you can modulate how
242.76s: many short calls you sell and we'll get
244.44s: into what that trade-off looks like in a
245.94s: little bit so those those are the legs
247.50s: that's it it's really not that
248.76s: complicated so I want to run you through
250.56s: the overall management real quick
252.00s: because I just gave you what the max
253.80s: profit and the max losses for each of
255.72s: those but let's take a look at p l
257.76s: management for the cash secured put I'm
260.16s: typically going to look at something
261.24s: around 65 Max profit I personally use a
265.14s: sliding scale that's IV adjusted days to
268.26s: expiration I'm not going to go into that
270.24s: into this video because it really
272.58s: doesn't offer that big of an enhancement
275.22s: over this as a general approach then for
279.06s: the long stock normally I'm just going
281.70s: to use support and resistance using
283.86s: moving averages linear regression
285.42s: channels kind of what you typically
286.98s: would do when you're trading so whatever
289.26s: your overall approach is to managing
292.26s: long stock positions that's what I would
294.42s: apply here now the products I trade make
297.12s: this slightly different and in general
299.76s: I'm mostly going to be looking at taking
301.74s: profit when I want to unwind the
303.42s: position but I overall look at things
305.82s: like moving averages linear regression
307.32s: channels because I don't want to ride
309.66s: things all the way down if I don't have
311.16s: to we'll get into that in a little bit
312.72s: but overall that's what I'm looking at
314.16s: for the cash secured put in the long
315.72s: stock for the covered call the profit is
318.06s: just going to be managed at whatever the
319.38s: short strike is and I'm going to let it
321.42s: expire more often than not we can get
323.28s: into managing the covered call section
325.38s: of the trade when it's in the money in a
327.00s: little bit but overall that's what I'm
328.38s: going to do that's why I'm selling the
329.82s: short strike on those calls because I'm
332.16s: comfortable unwinding there so for the
334.56s: Lost side because I trade very curated
338.82s: products for this strategy my loss
341.70s: management is very different than just
344.04s: about every other strategy that I run in
347.52s: this case if you are trading a normal
350.28s: stock like a growth stock something that
352.50s: you hope goes up but you're not super
354.24s: convicted your technical analysis you
356.52s: know makes you believe that you're
357.72s: pretty you know confident that it's
359.04s: going to move in your direction but not
360.42s: totally then I would apply your general
363.06s: Loss Management approach to any other
366.30s: long stock position that you have
367.68s: meaning I normally would use support and
370.02s: resistance in the broader Trend I'm
371.64s: gonna go into why when I'm trading my
374.40s: variation of this strategy I don't
376.62s: really follow this because I really
379.02s: don't take many losses in this strategy
380.88s: at all and that's not like uh some sort
382.80s: of huge Flex I'm always right I'm not
384.54s: you're joking right there are periods
386.64s: where I'm very wrong but the way I
388.86s: structure the strategy I'm okay being
390.90s: wrong and holding an unrealized loss for
393.30s: periods of time provided that we manage
395.22s: the rest of the strategy correctly which
396.84s: we're going to get into in just a second
398.34s: so from here let's talk about the
400.62s: process so that you get a feel for how
402.12s: this works first we are going to have
404.34s: that cash secured put and that's
406.26s: typically how I'm going to enter the
407.82s: trade from there there are two scenarios
409.86s: that cash secured put can be out of the
411.96s: money in which we would sell again or it
414.78s: can be in the money and then if it's in
416.52s: the money you have three choices you can
419.10s: close those in the money short puts for
421.44s: a loss I very rarely pretty much never
423.60s: do that you could roll them out I do
425.88s: this very frequently or you can take
427.68s: assignment if you take assignment there
430.74s: are a few other scenarios that happen
432.30s: here you're now going to be long shares
434.94s: because cash secure put means part of
437.58s: that bargain is if you're assigned
439.38s: you're gonna buy the underlying at your
441.78s: strike price so you're going to be long
443.52s: at your strike price that's when I would
446.10s: offer those covered calls at a ratio the
448.74s: same time I'm going to sell more cash
451.50s: secure puts the way I manage this is by
454.86s: creating very careful scaling protocols
458.58s: that allow me to have Capital to
461.04s: continue to add more cash secured puts
463.62s: to manage the basis this is one of the
466.14s: biggest differences in this strategy
467.64s: compared to anything else in general
469.56s: adding to losing trades is a poor
472.14s: Prospect in this scenario it's slightly
474.78s: different because what I'm doing is very
477.90s: carefully manipulating my basis on the
481.32s: way down when things aren't working
483.18s: there is a period of time where it's
484.80s: painful you're holding something that's
486.24s: losing money it's uncomfortable but
488.10s: notice how I'm trading iwm I've never
490.68s: seen any sort of U.S based broad market
494.10s: index not make new Highs at some point
496.74s: so if my hypothesis in that changed
499.56s: eventually sure I would take a loss no
501.90s: problem but this isn't Japan Japan has
503.94s: that scenario where they still haven't
505.32s: made new Highs but if we Zoom all the
507.66s: way out this is going back essentially
509.58s: to the Inception of iwm we've never not
512.52s: made new Highs at some point in time
514.68s: even if we take a look very quickly at
516.90s: SPX another broad base well really we
519.30s: would use spy but SPX just let us lets
521.70s: us go back further in time notice how
523.50s: we've gone down before but we've never
525.66s: not made new highs that part is so
528.54s: important to the strategy because
529.92s: there's no other scenario that I would
532.26s: feel comfortable adding risk on the way
534.54s: down but in this scenario I do feel
536.70s: comfortable you just have to be patient
538.02s: so in this scenario we now have have
540.18s: essentially the full coverage strangle
542.22s: where we're long the equity we have the
544.68s: ratio covered call and we have the cash
546.36s: secure put out that is the entire setup
548.52s: now in this scenario if you're trying to
550.08s: avoid assignment which I'll get into the
551.64s: trade-offs here in a minute and you
553.02s: choose to roll those short puts then
555.00s: really if you're just up here you just
556.74s: go back up to selling and managing the
558.66s: cash secure put now I want to talk to
560.34s: you real quick about the covered call
562.20s: side because now we have more options we
564.48s: have the cash secure puts that we're
566.22s: managing which I went over up here and
567.90s: now we have the covered calls where
569.10s: there's two scenarios either they're
571.14s: going to be out of the money and if
572.52s: they're out of the money we're just
573.54s: going to offer more covered calls and
575.34s: then if they're in the money we allow
577.50s: them to be assigned or we can roll them
580.20s: if we roll them we just go back up here
582.36s: to the cover call and keep managing it
584.34s: as as is again the main differentiation
587.58s: between how I'm going to roll short puts
590.64s: versus short calls short puts I
593.82s: typically roll pretty aggressively to
595.44s: manage my basis so I don't get stuck at
597.42s: a top the short calls I rarely Will Roll
600.48s: unless it's I can clearly make a lot
603.24s: more money but otherwise allowing
605.28s: assignment here is a big part of the
606.78s: strategy because it frees up capital of
609.60s: long Equity that we can now offer again
612.54s: via the cash secured puts let's now talk
615.24s: about the products I gave you a little
617.28s: bit of a preamble but this is such an
619.56s: important aspect to the strategy I'm
622.02s: gonna look for very liquid products
623.70s: ideally that have weeklies the weeklies
626.10s: aren't always super liquid but if
628.26s: something offers weeklies generally
630.24s: speaking it's going to be liquid because
632.16s: there's at least some demand there but
634.20s: overall I'm gonna focus on liquidity
636.48s: what's Liquid you can essentially look
638.64s: at ETFs large cap stocks those kind of
641.52s: products the reason why liquidity
643.20s: matters in this case is because there
644.64s: are periods of time where you're rolling
646.20s: deep in the money options if they're not
648.00s: liquid you're going to get eaten alive
649.68s: in those instances I sometimes will
652.62s: prioritize a dividend sometimes I won't
654.96s: if I'm looking for a dividend I would
656.76s: want something at least two percent if
658.92s: it's offering a dividend if I'm trading
661.26s: an index ETF I sacrifice some of that
663.48s: the reason why I like these products and
666.54s: specifically why I like iwm versus the
670.50s: spy for example I'll actually throw a
672.84s: video in the notes below why I prefer
674.82s: spy over iwm
677.52s: stoich I totally dork that up I mean why
679.98s: I like iwm over spy but it really comes
683.16s: down to diversification of the products
685.14s: and volatility typically speaking iwm is
688.32s: going to have slightly more volatility
689.94s: on average which when we're selling
691.86s: options we want that the other thing is
693.66s: diversification if you take a look at
695.28s: the S P 500 notice there's a lot of
697.68s: products but Microsoft Apple Google meta
700.86s: they make up a lot of the index whereas
703.62s: you look at the Russell 2000 that's
705.06s: really not the case it's very well
706.86s: Diversified the top 10 Holdings make up
709.56s: like two percent of this product whereas
711.84s: this it's like 20 so overall you're
713.88s: gonna get better diversification and
715.44s: volatility in iwm but sometimes you
717.18s: could trade individual large cap stocks
719.04s: if you're looking for a little bit more
720.36s: growth I don't do that so much anymore
722.22s: myself but I definitely did back in the
724.38s: day when I was trying to aggressively
725.76s: grow the account now for implied
728.34s: volatility like I said we are trading
730.20s: options and short options so in general
732.66s: I am going to prefer periods where
735.18s: implied volatility is going to be
736.80s: trending over realize volatility meaning
738.96s: the variance risk premiums are a little
741.18s: more in Vogue if you will so if I zoom
743.46s: in here to a six month daily we can see
745.56s: essentially that Trend between the
747.90s: yellow and the white lines I want to be
749.46s: very clear this is not a determining
751.20s: Factor on whether or not I'm going to
752.88s: put the product on but this is sometimes
755.40s: an informing factor in terms of what
758.10s: scaling protocols I'm going to implement
759.72s: and what initial size I'm going to offer
762.30s: this becomes important then so I'm going
764.40s: to get more aggressive when implied
766.14s: volatility percentile is above 20
768.18s: typically but most importantly when this
770.88s: relationship widens when the variance
772.68s: risk premiums are greater and if you're
774.12s: unfamiliar with that concept I'll throw
775.86s: a link in the notes Below on variants
777.66s: versus premiums very similar to the
780.54s: volatility side of the equation for
782.16s: technical analysis fundamental analysis
783.96s: the way I think about this is it is a
786.84s: long-term position meaning the
788.64s: hypothesis for this could be a one year
790.68s: hold a two-year hold a three-year hold
792.72s: but it's comprising of a bunch of
795.48s: short-term trades as well so a apply the
798.24s: correct analysis that fits your approach
799.92s: to these things for me I'm going to look
802.20s: at different time frames when I'm
803.94s: trading something like iwm for the
806.10s: coverage strangle again based on my
808.20s: technical analysis I'm not necessarily
810.54s: not going to trade it but if I wanted to
812.82s: let's say this wasn't iwm let's say that
814.86s: this was just stock XYZ probably
817.08s: wouldn't buy it here it's I would want
818.88s: to see it break above 180 essentially
821.04s: but really it has a lot of downward
823.32s: pressure but with iwm I don't care as
826.20s: much because I'm amplifying the position
828.00s: with options and it's a longer term hold
830.34s: so the way that I'm applying this
832.44s: analysis is more to inform me on how
835.02s: much I want to offer initially and then
836.88s: how I'm going to scale into the position
838.92s: so I'm going to look at things like
840.60s: moving averages I'm going to look at
842.28s: things like linear regression channels I
844.26s: will throw a video in the notes below
846.54s: that walks through the technical
848.46s: analysis I typically like to use then
850.62s: for individual stocks fundamental
853.02s: analysis is really important I'm going
854.82s: to be looking at things like sales
856.44s: revenue overall profitability of the
859.32s: company which if we take a quick look at
861.84s: a scan this is just a very general scan
864.24s: that I use this is looking within the S
866.16s: P 500 that has weeklies I'm looking for
868.56s: something that's solvent has a decent
870.42s: quick ratio typically I prefer it above
872.22s: one that revenue is continuing to grow
874.98s: sales per share is continuing to grow
876.72s: that it's trading above the 50 period
879.00s: EMA the 20 period EMA you could pick
880.98s: different EMAs but then I'm also going
882.48s: to look at all these other kind of
884.52s: ratios cash flow relative value free
887.46s: cash flow PE ratios stuff like that but
890.58s: because I'm typically trading in index
892.92s: ETF I actually don't care quite as much
895.44s: so let's now pivot over to best
897.90s: practices we're going to talk about all
899.58s: of these specifically how to think about
901.98s: them and what the trade-offs are for
904.38s: each so for the cash secured put side of
907.14s: it I'm typically going to offer at a
908.94s: Delta of 0.15 to 0.5 the trade-off here
912.96s: the way to think about it is do you want
914.76s: to sell a 20 Delta or a 30 Delta the
916.98s: higher the Delta you sell the more
919.20s: upfront money you are going to collect
921.24s: however the trade-off is the probability
923.52s: of it falling in the money and requiring
925.32s: management is going to be greater that's
927.06s: your trade-off the other thing to
928.68s: consider is that the lower Delta you
930.72s: sell the lower the basis is going to be
933.48s: those are the two primary inputs that I
936.18s: think about when I'm choosing a Delta
938.40s: the other thing to keep in mind is the
940.50s: distance off of highs and this kind of
943.20s: bleeds into number two here but if we're
945.48s: very close to Market highs I'm typically
947.94s: going to favor a lower Delta like a 20
950.10s: or 25 Delta and that's just because the
952.62s: propensity for us to fall down becomes
954.90s: greater if we're revving right against
956.82s: highs now one of the Premier aspects of
959.94s: my strategy is sizing and scaling the
962.10s: way I think about this is every single
964.08s: trade I put on has three features it has
966.96s: a total Capital allocation how much
969.48s: money am I going to give to this trade
971.46s: in total I Define that up front then the
975.06s: initial outlay is the second piece what
977.28s: is my initial offering going to be as a
980.34s: percentage of my total allocation and
983.40s: the third thing based on that remaining
985.56s: amount of money that's not used in the
987.90s: initial outlay how do I scale into the
991.20s: trade so the way to think about the
993.42s: trade-offs here is the allocation is
996.12s: what it is that's whatever fits into
997.50s: your portfolio this comprises the core
1000.56s: allocation of my core port folio so I'm
1003.98s: very generous with the total allocation
1006.02s: I like to split my portfolio into two
1008.24s: buckets core and speculative core being
1010.64s: my main effort as we would say in the
1012.44s: Marine Corps that's my bid for Success
1013.94s: it's how I want to meet my primary
1015.44s: investing objectives so I'm very
1017.36s: generous with my allocations there so
1019.64s: that's the total allocation for the
1021.44s: initial outlay I'm going to look at two
1024.08s: things I'm going to look at our
1025.58s: percentages off of all-time highs the
1028.40s: closer we are to all-time highs the less
1030.56s: I'm going to offer maybe like 20 30 and
1034.70s: also implied volatility if we're really
1037.34s: close to all-time highs and implied
1039.20s: volatility is very low I'm gonna scale
1041.78s: down quite a bit because you stand to
1044.72s: lose more than you really stand to make
1046.58s: it becomes difficult to trade the
1048.02s: strategy the way to think about the
1049.76s: initial outlay is if it's a bigger
1052.22s: outlay you're going to make more money
1054.02s: up front it's a bigger credit right
1055.70s: larger position but you sacrifice being
1058.70s: able to able to scale in on the way down
1061.64s: so for example sample coming back to
1063.68s: this during covid which is a really
1065.84s: great recent example if I we were
1068.36s: trading here where volatility was low
1070.46s: and we were near highs relative to the
1073.22s: point in time if I was like fully
1075.56s: allocated here I would have had nothing
1077.72s: to add on the way down I would have
1079.88s: essentially had to sit on my hands and
1082.52s: wait until we rallied out of here and
1085.52s: then made new highs that's okay it's not
1087.80s: a worst case scenario because you're
1089.72s: still eventually going to make money but
1091.46s: that's not what I'm looking for I want
1093.14s: to be able to scale in on the way down
1095.84s: so that as we make this v-shaped
1098.18s: recovery which I didn't know at the
1099.44s: point in time as we make that recovery I
1102.20s: can make a lot more money so it is
1105.38s: important to note that when we're
1107.12s: thinking about scaling it's a tricky
1110.60s: Prospect I typically am going to use
1112.94s: something like each five percent decline
1115.40s: I'm gonna look at deploying something
1117.08s: whether it's five percent of my
1118.70s: remaining allocation 10 you have to
1120.80s: figure out what's right for you but you
1122.18s: have to think think about scaling is
1123.74s: silver bullets because going back to
1126.38s: this example if let's say I had actually
1129.62s: let's say I had 80 allocated so let's
1133.70s: say I had a hundred dollars in this
1135.32s: position and I wanted to scale in on the
1138.38s: way down if I had no money left to scale
1140.78s: I could only scale in 20 more dollars
1142.70s: your basis isn't going to change that
1144.38s: much now let's say you had a thousand
1146.24s: dollars I'm just using round numbers
1147.56s: because I'm an idiot and it's easier for
1149.24s: me well if I say yes I'm an idiot right
1152.24s: um but let's say you have a thousand
1153.86s: dollars allocated to this trade but you
1155.66s: enter with a hundred dollars now if you
1158.42s: scale in with another hundred dollars up
1160.22s: here your basis is going to be the
1161.96s: difference between those two not bad
1163.64s: good basis Improvement in order to get
1165.86s: the same kind of basis Improvement again
1168.26s: now you have two hundred dollars in the
1170.12s: trade you have to add 200 so you went
1172.40s: from 100 utilization to 200 utilization
1174.80s: to 400 utilization if you wanted to do
1177.32s: that again now you're at 800 utilization
1179.12s: the point being the more you add to the
1181.58s: trade the more money you need to make a
1184.22s: meaningful impact on your basis so I
1186.50s: like to scale meaningfully up front but
1189.20s: then slow down and wait on the way down
1191.72s: because the average bear Market is 298
1194.78s: days so I actually left a lot of money
1198.02s: on the table here because I was scaling
1200.00s: in based on my typical protocols which
1202.10s: again is keeping in mind a longer bear
1205.04s: Market which we didn't get so I left a
1207.02s: lot of money on the table but I was
1208.22s: geared up for a much worse case scenario
1210.08s: so that whenever we eventually do bottom
1213.02s: I still my basis is decent enough that I
1216.38s: can continue to trade options around it
1218.36s: because this goes into number three my
1221.18s: short call Delta I prefer to be above
1224.24s: the basis of my shares so right now
1227.42s: again is a great example of this if we
1230.12s: go to the analyze Tab and we put on the
1232.16s: actual trade that I have which is short
1234.62s: two separate lots of puts I'm long 800
1237.92s: shares short six calls my basis is 181
1241.10s: that's over here but iwm is trading down
1244.04s: here at 176. so by by scaling in I
1248.72s: Didn't Start the trade with 800 shares I
1250.70s: started with probably two or 400 shares
1252.80s: but by scaling in on the way down I was
1255.56s: able to improve my basis enough to at
1257.54s: least be able to sell calls against it
1259.82s: that allow me to collect something
1261.68s: reasonable if your basis is too high you
1265.70s: lose the ability to sell short calls
1267.80s: above your basis because if you do short
1271.04s: calls if you sell them below your basis
1273.20s: you're now possibly locking in a loss
1276.02s: which sucks especially if you've been
1277.88s: holding the trade for a long time so I
1280.04s: really look to avoid that and then at a
1281.96s: ratio because we get to maintain upside
1283.70s: potential we already went through
1285.14s: technical analysis fundamental analysis
1287.36s: all of this stuff is really what drives
1289.88s: how much I want to scale when I want to
1291.68s: take profits the most important part is
1293.84s: don't fall in love with specifically if
1295.94s: they're individual stocks stay sensitive
1298.16s: to whatever your benchmarks are now days
1300.08s: to expiration where pretty much all of
1301.94s: these I'm going to be looking at
1303.20s: something between 0 and 50 days out I
1305.66s: base that on implied volatility and then
1307.94s: the current market conditions here's why
1309.74s: if the markets are really low implied
1312.44s: volatility and steadily grinding higher
1314.90s: I'm gonna favor the longer duration so
1317.42s: that I can collect enough money for the
1319.04s: trade to make sense I'm looking for
1320.42s: about a one percent return on invested
1322.70s: capital for the cash secure puts so if
1325.40s: you're not able to get that because
1326.78s: implied volatility is too low you kind
1328.70s: of have to add more time if you're in
1330.86s: markets like we see now you don't
1332.60s: actually have to do that so I tend to
1334.46s: prefer shorter term time frames and it's
1336.98s: for several reasons one variance risk
1339.38s: premiums are going to be higher two it
1341.54s: allows me to be more sensitive to
1343.16s: current spot price movements so that if
1345.92s: I decide to manage the trade I have more
1348.26s: opportunity what do I mean by that great
1350.30s: question let me show you so if we pull
1352.46s: up this options chain let's say right
1354.50s: now I have short puts out in 22 May if
1358.16s: these fell in the money I could roll
1360.32s: them out to 24 May add two days I can
1363.02s: roll them out to 26 May to 30 May
1365.06s: because of the weekly expirations I have
1367.28s: a ton of choices because the trade-off
1369.26s: here is the further out in time you go
1371.12s: the more money you collect but you start
1373.88s: you have to wait longer first but you
1376.28s: lose sensitivity what I mean by that is
1378.26s: let's say instead I had these short puts
1381.08s: out 41 days out and then they fall in
1383.54s: the money quickly well the next role I
1386.12s: have available is 62 days then 90 days
1389.66s: so instead of adding two days to the
1391.88s: trade that I have to wait I'm now adding
1393.98s: 30 at a clip so that's the trade-off
1396.92s: here the shorter term time frames you
1398.78s: can trade typically I prefer you're
1400.34s: going to get better Theta Decay but in
1402.80s: low implied volatility environments
1404.48s: slowly ascending markets it's difficult
1406.04s: to do that now for Rolling or rolling
1408.50s: versus Simon a couple things to keep in
1410.48s: mind for the short puts or the short
1413.42s: calls the best time to roll meaning when
1415.64s: you have the most choices whether you
1417.14s: want to roll out in time not too far or
1419.72s: out in time and up or down depending on
1421.88s: if it's a put or a call when the stock
1424.34s: equals your strike price that's when
1426.20s: you're going to have the most
1426.86s: opportunities but you have to balance a
1428.96s: few things you have to balance how much
1430.70s: time value you're buying back so if we
1433.58s: go to this example and let's say I
1435.68s: wanted to roll these puts for whatever
1437.66s: reason I'm buying back thirty dollars
1440.48s: that otherwise would Decay out so that's
1443.48s: the time value you're buying back that I
1445.64s: don't want to do that I want to make
1446.90s: money on the time value not buy it back
1449.06s: then you also have to think about
1450.44s: sensitivity to days to expiration which
1452.48s: I just went over making sure that we can
1454.82s: try to stay close in time to give us
1457.04s: more choices we have better Theta Decay
1459.68s: because the Theta Decay curve is going
1461.12s: to be really fast in here
1462.98s: um and if you need to roll you have more
1465.38s: expirations available to you without
1466.76s: going super far out in time but then
1468.38s: also your basis because sometimes as the
1471.20s: markets just continue to grind down
1473.06s: those short puts can get really tricky
1475.04s: and you have to figure out the best way
1477.50s: for you to manage your basis and
1479.06s: sometimes you have to go instead of
1480.50s: going two days out or four days out you
1482.24s: have to go 20 days out but this way
1484.10s: instead of your basis let's say these
1486.32s: you know 174s were in the money let's
1488.66s: say you looked two days out or four days
1490.70s: out and you're like okay well I can roll
1492.44s: those 174s to 172. but let's say you go
1495.68s: 20 days out you're like okay well I can
1497.48s: actually get them to 164 now for a
1500.00s: credit that's really impactful and that
1502.22s: hits an important concept when we're
1503.78s: rolling in either of these instances I'm
1505.88s: gonna look for a credit if you can't get
1507.98s: a credit sometimes a small debit is okay
1511.16s: provided the overall position is still
1513.74s: profitable which I have a bunch of
1515.78s: videos on rolling and how you can track
1517.70s: that math I'll throw those in the notes
1519.38s: below but the trade-off here simply
1521.00s: comes down to
1522.38s: um do you want to roll to improve your
1524.42s: basis do you want to improve your
1526.16s: profitability or do you want to allow a
1528.50s: sign specifically if it's short calls
1531.02s: for example I'm typically going to air
1532.64s: on just allowing them to be assigned but
1534.26s: if you can roll and make some more money
1535.58s: that's okay so the last thing I want to
1537.68s: talk about here is the allocated Capital
1539.24s: because this is a capital intensive
1541.04s: strategy so one of the things I talk
1543.02s: about now is being able to actually put
1545.48s: the capital you have allocated to the
1547.22s: trade into something that earns the
1549.32s: risk-free rate so we can kind of double
1550.82s: dip this is something that a lot of
1552.44s: people don't think about so for example
1554.18s: let's say that we're gonna put one
1555.74s: hundred thousand dollars allocated to
1557.48s: this strategy you're going to use twenty
1559.10s: thousand dollars up front you might not
1562.04s: even need all twenty thousand if you're
1563.78s: selling puts and then you have eighty
1565.70s: thousand dollars as just sitting there
1567.08s: typically what I'll do is I'll take the
1569.42s: money that's not being used and I'll put
1571.58s: it into box spreads and I'll just be
1574.04s: careful about the timing so let's say
1576.56s: for example I have short puts expiring
1578.90s: 26 May right now I have box spreads out
1581.90s: in SPX that expire 24 May or that even
1585.20s: expired uh yesterday today is the 20th
1588.08s: of May so the that I can cover these as
1591.02s: well if I'm to get assigned so by
1593.18s: deconflicting the timing of the Box
1595.16s: spread it allows you to capture the
1596.90s: risk-free rate on the capital that
1598.52s: otherwise would just be sitting there
1600.08s: and this is more pertinent now because
1603.02s: the risk-free rates over five percent so
1605.24s: you could put in a 10-day box spread and
1607.58s: at least make something on it as
1609.02s: compared to the money just sitting there
1610.34s: so I'll throw a video Below on box
1612.86s: spread so that you can figure out how I
1614.48s: like to think about those and using that
1616.40s: to really maximize The Profit potential
1618.68s: of the strategy so that's the overview
1620.84s: of the coverage strangle I know you're
1622.40s: thinking 30 minute video how can that be
1624.14s: an overview I've spent a lot of time
1625.64s: developing the strategy so I'll throw a
1627.74s: playlist below that walks through a
1630.08s: bunch of live trades that I have on how
1632.24s: I manage them how I look at the current
1633.68s: markets to manage the trade in that
1635.78s: scenario because I trade it so much if
