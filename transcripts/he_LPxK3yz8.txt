894.00s:  you
896.00s:  annualized, you can hopefully double or double plus that. Now my return for last year,
903.84s:  I've already told you it landed at 92.22 and that now takes my, this should be 17 years. That
913.12s:  was my 17th full year, no 18th full year of trading. My bad, 18 years of trading. Damn, that's kind of
921.04s:  not, says it. That's, that's crazy. Sorry, I just another year prepped up on it. That's crazy.
935.12s:  So 18th full year of trading. So that takes my compound annual growth rate over the 18 years to 31.6
944.72s:  that is primarily skewed from the last two years. So if I update this really quick to give you
955.44s:  what it would be sub those two years, it would be 20.35%. That's getting rid of the
962.96s:  118% return from last year and then the 92% from this year. If I change those really fast,
970.80s:  well, 118 from the primary and it was a little bit over that. It was like 172%, which was a
978.32s:  significant change. But the overall return eye track it as 118, which is the primary output
988.40s:  from general trading activities. But change both of those to 15% out of curiosity. That would take my
995.28s:  compound annual growth rate to 22.5%. So these last two years have single-handedly skewed my
1003.92s:  entire compound annual growth rate trading performance. Now, the reason why that matters is I want
1011.76s:  to give you a couple examples. And if we go to the website, which hopefully you all are enjoying
1019.76s:  the tools that are on here. And if we go to the compound interest calculator, and we take a look at
1026.72s:  somebody that's starting with $25,000, let's say that they're saving $2,000 per month. And let's say
1032.88s:  that they're looking at this for a 20-year time span. If they have a benchmark return and let's say
1040.40s:  the S&P 500, instead of being 8%, this is a little bit dated, let's say the S&P 500 is like 11%.
1047.60s:  And then let's say that you actually return 20% on average. The difference here is massive,
1055.04s:  right? So if we compare to the benchmark return over this time frame, the benchmark would have
1060.64s:  returned you 1.7 million. The 20% that you might be able to return would pull you at 5.4 million.
1070.00s:  So you double and change what the S&P 500 would give you. This is what trading is about.
1077.12s:  This is exactly why we do what we do. The entire purpose behind this is to permit, for me,
1086.96s:  more reliable and steady growth based on application of a skill set. Now, there's nothing wrong with
1095.36s:  that 1.7 million dollars that you might earn in spy. And then once you get rid of taxes and
1100.24s:  stuff like that, it's a great return. But significantly less than what you can make being even a
1109.20s:  solid trader, not a perfect trader, not the best trader, a solid trader. And that's what this is,
1117.04s:  right? That's why I use 20%. You'll find traders all the time that outperform this. And I always
1122.88s:  will bring that to your attention because the pool of potential is very, very deep. So
1134.72s:  if we take a look, this doesn't look like it's updated, but it'll still serve the purpose.
1144.48s:  Yeah, this is only through 30 now. They don't have through DCAT. So this is looking at the US
1150.08s:  investing championship. And let's take a look at the returns here. So this is 11 month returns.
1156.80s:  So we can see for money manager, the reason why money managers really, really important is because
1163.60s:  money managers have different imperatives that they have to follow. And it looks like J law
1168.88s:  and Judy lie, which these people look like they work at the same spot. 308%, 230%
1175.92s:  and area candle candle wall 144% so and so forth. In hands growth, meaning that we can use derivatives
1188.00s:  1562, 48. You'll find this to be the case actually pretty regularly, which is always interesting to
1193.92s:  me that when people have derivatives included that they tend to do worse than equities. And I just
1199.76s:  find that fascinating. Then the actual stock division, $20,000 accounts, I honestly don't care
1205.92s:  that much about because it's much easier to scale a very small account like this. But you can see
1210.88s:  that there's somebody literally with almost a thousand percent return, right? Crazy. Then if we go down
1216.24s:  to the derivative side of things still for very small accounts, 20K, 610. So then if we typically hold
1224.48s:  on, where's the, where's the rest of this? There's another, those bullshit. So for those that don't
1233.92s:  know, there's another bucket. I don't know why it's split like this, but there's a million plus
1239.04s:  bucket that's not here for some reason. I don't know why it's not here, but that there's typically
1245.52s:  another group. Now, and it's not the money managers to be clear, the money managers are different
1252.56s:  than just million plus accounts, but larger accounts are more difficult to scale. What I'm just
1258.08s:  showing you is what's possible. This is what's possible. Now, my planning factor here is literally
1264.08s:  20%. Right? So take that in the context of what I was just showing you is possible. And that's why I
1271.20s:  use this as what's possible because it's genuinely possible and attainable by people.
1278.64s:  Now, that leads us into this, the title of the live stream, which is creating a game plan for 2025.
1294.80s:  When you're trying to accomplish something, you have to have a target to shoot at. If you do not have
1303.44s:  a distinct target that you're shooting at, then you tend to hit all over the place,
1309.68s:  kind of randomness, right? And this is from a shooting perspective. You likely will have heard this
1315.60s:  before if you shoot, but aim small, miss small. And I've used this example before because it's a
1322.24s:  really, really great example. And I'll show you what I mean.
1326.32s:  If we grab just a shooting target, just grab something completely random. And let's say that you're
1335.12s:  shooting at this B mod target or whatever these other silhouette targets are. Sorry, not B mod
1342.40s:  silhouette. If your goal is literally just to hit somewhere inside the body, your grouping is
1353.76s:  probably going to be terrible. You'll probably get something over here, something over here,
1358.16s:  something over here, all over the place. The concept of aim small, miss small, is I'm going to not
1364.40s:  just aim for this X. I'm going to aim for the intersection of the X and pick a needle point
1373.36s:  that I'm trying to drive a needle through. That's at the dead center of the intersection of that.
1380.24s:  The whole point of that is to remain very, very focused on the exact spot you want the rounds to go.
1386.08s:  Now, taking this back into the world of trading, you have to decide what you're shooting for.
1396.64s:  What is the target that you are trying to hit? exceedingly, exceedingly important. Because if your
1407.68s:  goal is just to trade and see what happens, guess what is probably going to happen to you?
1415.76s:  You're probably going to get results that align with just trading and just seeing what happens.
1425.84s:  That's not ideal. This is why I think it's really, really effective to try and determine
1433.28s:  some sort of return potential for yourself. Now, you've also heard me say this before.
1439.44s:  And I genuinely believe newer traders don't get to pick what their return is going to be.
1449.12s:  The reason why newer traders don't get to pick is because newer traders don't even know what they're
1455.84s:  capable of producing yet. So if you don't know what you're capable of producing, you picking something
1462.40s:  doesn't make any sense. So a lot of what I'm talking about here is from the perspective of slightly
1469.20s:  more seasoned traders that have a little bit of a track record that they can lean on and use as a
1477.04s:  planning factor. If you are a new trader, my position for that cohort is a little bit different.
1486.40s:  And I believe newer traders should focus way more on a fundamental level of first, be profitable.
1496.64s:  Make greater than zero dollars. I genuinely believe that is likely
1506.32s:  the target that will keep you from blowing yourself up until you're at a point that you can
1512.16s:  scale it, which is a thing. You will be able to scale it at some point. But right in the beginning,
1519.20s:  it's very difficult to scale something based on a skill set that you don't really know whether or
1527.36s:  not you have. So one of the biggest issues newer traders will base is they'll say I want x% return.
1540.48s:  And that's fine and dandy. The problem with just randomly saying I want x% return is you may or
1549.68s:  may not be able to achieve it. So if you focus first on simply trying to be profitable for your first
1557.20s:  couple of years, seeing what the skill set looks like, seeing what you're capable of producing,
1562.24s:  then you're in a much better spot to come up with an informed decision. Dan says I used to watch
1568.72s:  this other YouTuber who swore by taking profit as soon as it hits 10%, which doesn't make any sense.
1575.12s:  I would easily pick apart that framework. It doesn't make any sense. But that's just for one trade
1584.24s:  rather than an cumulative total for a period of time. Yeah, that doesn't make any sense whatsoever.
1589.68s:  So the problem with coming up with arbitrary targets like that is it's completely insensitive
1598.08s:  to the expected return for the strategy. So picking an arbitrary thing of 10% is just that. It's
1605.60s:  completely arbitrary. And you run into the problem of the system itself. That's
1612.40s:  quintessential disposition effect where if you'll remember standard disposition effect,
1618.96s:  it's where we have a profit that we take down too fast for whatever reason. A lot of times it's
1628.80s:  because we want to realize a gain. We like the process of realizing a game. So yeah, I would argue
1637.28s:  that that is not logical. That's just not a solid route to take. Again, there's a way that
1646.72s:  taking small profits can work. I'm not crashing out and saying small profits never make sense
1652.64s:  or anything like that. I'm just saying picking a defined something like that doesn't really make
1657.60s:  sense. And Riz says you'll never land in a pp like that. That's literally an exact point.
1665.84s:  So for those that don't know what Riz is referring to is a position that I put on in a pp a while
1671.12s:  ago. Hey, it looks like it's actually setting up again. But I entered in here. And I wrote it
1678.96s:  all the way up through here, scaled down a little bit, added more here. And then I ultimately scaled
1684.08s:  out here. And then I think I flattened out the rest of the position a few days into it. So
1691.60s:  that's based on a specific strategy though. That's not to argue that this is the only way to trade.
1699.28s:  It's not. This is one approach that I take in a book of many. So to give you an initial starting
1707.20s:  point, I want to show you the coverage strangles that I'm going to be running this year. And I did
1715.28s:  a little bit of homework today on what I think I want to do. And I want to walk you through the
1721.04s:  homework so that you have context. Again, that's one of the things that I try to equip you with is
1729.60s:  the approach on how to do things for yourself. So there are two coverage strangles strategies
1740.56s:  that I want to talk about. One of them is in T triple cues. And then one of them is in Upro.
1748.16s:  And I want to talk about some of the math behind the way that we can set these up. And then for
1755.76s:  roaring city, the way that you fix that is you go into studies. I'm literally going to make a video
1759.84s:  about this because people ask about it all the time. You go into volume profile. And then you
1766.96s:  turn off expansion area. So expansion area needs to be turned off. And then it will overlay it here.
1773.20s:  Then you have to go down here to globals. And you can change the colors of the zone itself.
1779.68s:  I get rid of a lot of the noise. I get rid of the value areas and stuff like that. Because I don't
1783.76s:  really care. None of that matters to me. But that is a quick version on how to fix that.
1789.84s:  So then next, if we take a look at this, I want to show you something. We'll do it in here. This is fine.
1806.40s:  So let's say that we have $100,000. I don't know why it just moved me to here. Not do that.
1813.52s:  The $100,000 that we're going to use. And let's say that we have a couple choices.
1823.92s:  The first choice is we could put it into spy. We could put it into SSO or we could put it into you,
1829.04s:  pro. This is 1x. This is 2x. This is 3x daily returns. Very important point daily return.
1837.84s:  So the first thing I want you to think about is if we were using this $100,000 in this example.
1848.48s:  And we want to assess the return performance for all of these. Let's actually, well, that doesn't matter.
1857.44s:  We can do it from a theoretical sense. I was going to grab the actual returns for 24,
1860.88s:  but it doesn't actually matter that much. So if we want to have $100,000 working in all of these
1867.68s:  positions, how much money do I have to put up in each of these positions to have $100,000 working?
1873.84s:  Well, in this one, I need $100,000. This one, I need $50,000. This one, I need what, 33,
1881.36s:  33, 3 repeating, something like that. What I'm showing you is you can, I guess you just,
1889.36s:  I don't know if like this. So it reuses the format.
1899.84s:  What do you notice here in this setup? If I want to maintain a $100,000 of exposure,
1912.08s:  and I want to maintain $100,000 of total exposure in something like the S&P 500,
1918.48s:  I have three tickers I can do it with. I can do it with spy, SSO, you pro, there's like SPXL,
1923.76s:  there's others you can use, but these are this one specifically is way more liquid.
1928.96s:  So if I want to maintain $100,000 of exposure, then in spy, I have to use all of it.
1937.20s:  In SSO, I have to use half of it. In you pro, I have to use a third of it.
1943.36s:  So the interesting part is that if you don't apply an overly greedy approach
1950.48s:  to maintaining the exposure that you want, when you use leveraged tickers like this,
1957.28s:  you can use less of your money up front, which then gives you way more flexibility
1965.12s:  as the underlying moves. So say for example, we got spy when it was $100. Let's just say all of these
1975.20s:  are $100. And we wanted to use all of the money to maintain the correct exposure.
1985.68s:  Well, in this scenario, we use all of our money, we buy it at $100. So that means as it moves around,
1993.76s:  it doesn't really matter that much because you're using all of your money. So if it goes down,
1998.16s:  you can't scale in because you've used the money. And if it goes up, that's great,
2002.80s:  but you're not really realizing any profit there unless you're selling calls against it,
2006.48s:  that's the main way you could realize profits in this scenario. So now, if we look at this in SSO,
2014.96s:  and the underlying starts to go down, guess what we can do, we can scale in on the way down
2020.48s:  because we're using less money. We have $50,000 that we can then apply to the strategy as something
2026.96s:  goes down if we're not automatically defaulting to the same dollar amount up front. This is a way
2034.16s:  to use leveraged ETFs to reduce your risk. Reduce your risk. So what I mean by that is let's say
2044.16s:  spy goes down by 30% as a 30% drop. So in this case, we have this minus this times this,
2059.68s:  this, and we're going to lock this.
2071.76s:  So in this scenario, if we have a 30% decline in total, the dollar amount that you can lose will
2081.20s:  look very different depending on the actual decline because these would also have two times the move
2088.24s:  here. So this becomes this, and then this becomes this.
2102.72s:  So you can see in this scenario, you're still losing way more money if you take something like this,
2121.52s:  straight punch to the face, and you hold it all the way down. You lose a lot more money.
2129.76s:  In this case, you only lose your 30K.
2136.64s:  In this, good, good, good. So you're using way more of your money and the total amount that you
2151.20s:  can lose as a gross dollar amount will be very static. So the interesting part in terms of what
2159.92s:  you're actually losing, you're losing way more of the total amount of money you have out. So if
2165.12s:  we do this as a percentage, you're down 90% of your money here. If you do this as a percentage,
2172.72s:  you're down 50, 60% of your money here. But as a total gross dollar amount, you're not really
2181.36s:  any worse off because we're sizing the position based on what it represents, rather than
2190.96s:  the overall same dollar amount invested. So that is why I'm trading Upro and
2199.20s:  T-Triple Cuse, three times leverage, is because I'm maintaining the correct exposure that I want
2207.36s:  to mirror the current exposure if I were to hold the underlying itself. However, I'm simply
2218.16s:  using less of my money. I'm risking about the same total amount of money during a drawdown,
2224.40s:  but I put less of it up. So and what that eventually allows me to do, let me grab this back,
2233.84s:  is as this starts to go down, I can then add to these to reduce the basis. Now what's the danger
2245.28s:  here? As soon as I start to add to them, my total risk will go up, whereas on this 30% down
2254.08s:  move, my spy position will only lose $30,000 and that's what it would be at at the 30%.
2260.08s:  If let's say it dropped 10%, and I started sizing up the risk in these, then I can lose more than
2268.24s:  this amount of money to have to be prepared during the process of scaling and pay attention to what
2276.24s:  the path might look like for you. This goes back to again, the entire point of the live stream today,
2284.96s:  which is to talk about creating a roadmap for 2025, what you're trying to do. And if that's not
2294.16s:  already defined, you have to define it. And this weekend, because guess what, the years already
2299.36s:  started. We're already a couple trading days in. Your trading performance over the course of a year
2304.64s:  is going to be built on what you do on a daily basis and you're two days in.
2310.48s:  So if you're trying to figure out what you want to do longer term, then now is the exact time
2320.80s:  to have that defined for the year. IR2BAD can says sounds like 9-6-Sorta. Yeah, I don't know much
2329.04s:  about the 9-6 strategy, but for my understanding, it looks just like a leveraged ETF trend following
2334.88s:  approach. So yeah, because the thing that is really important, I think, when it comes to managing
2343.60s:  a strategy like this is overlaying it with Shannon's demon, which we talked about actually on the
2349.28s:  live stream previously, with something like, with Peruvian pull and something like Shannon's demon
2358.32s:  can help reduce overall volatility pretty massively through a rebalancing protocol.
2364.56s:  So what that means is as these eventually go up, what we would do is take some of the money out
2370.96s:  to trim our exposure back to what we want the exposure to be. And then we can scale it. So
2379.76s:  let's use not even numbers now and do $200,000. So if you have $200,000 that you want to
2388.40s:  run into something like this, then you have to use all $200,000 up front for this.
2394.16s:  You're on a 30% drawdown, you expect a risk 60, but for us to sell, you need to use 100K,
2400.96s:  you pro, you need to use 66K to maintain this $200,000 exposure. So then the scenario now is if,
2411.44s:  let's say rather than going down, the market goes up. And let's, I think I could just change this.
2419.44s:  Yeah, I need to change these to pluses really quick. Give me back.
2424.00s:  Plus, plus,
2439.60s:  and then these need to be.
2440.80s:  So now, if the market starts to go up, depending on how much money and depending on the path that it
2455.84s:  eventually takes, what this is doing is applying the same amount of leverage, but you're using much
2465.76s:  less total money, much less total money. So let's go back to the down move side of things first,
2471.68s:  and we say we have a 30% drawdown on your total capital. And it looks like this is fine for now.
2482.16s:  The main point I want to make here is as things start going up,
2493.36s:  and let's say we get a 15% up move, 15%. So in this case, you would make your $200,000
2507.52s:  plus your $200,000 times 15%, give me 230. So then this would give you $100,000 plus,
2523.20s:  this times two times $100,000. So what ends up happening is you can still, I actually messed up
2540.16s:  the syntax there. Sorry. The point I'm trying to make is when you have it start going in your
2546.48s:  favor, you can rebalance to maintain the same dollar exposure that you actually want to keep.
2554.24s:  And if you maintain the correct dollar exposure for the underlying itself, then you can balance your
2562.40s:  risk, pull some of your risk off so that when we eventually get the down move, you're not actually
2571.12s:  risking any sort of significant premium over what the other account is. And then you can still
2577.04s:  maintain some of the upside potential, depending on how you scale on and stuff. So it's one of the
2581.20s:  really cool things when it comes to leveraged ETFs, they can reduce risk. But they have to be used
2589.76s:  really, really responsibly. One of the main things that you get to benefit from and why there's
2594.64s:  so fantastic for something like the coverage triangle is because a big part of the coverage
2602.80s:  triangle is scaling protocols. That under would underperform the underlying itself, unless you're in
2612.56s:  a sideways market, slightly down trending market, then the coverage triangle would outperform. So
2616.72s:  when they aggregate, it would outperform because the market will show all of those different cards.
2621.12s:  But during the up moves, you would slightly underperform. And it's because you have capital that's
2627.36s:  not being utilized to maintain the exposure. So for part of my portfolio, I will continue to run
2640.40s:  the coverage triangle in Upro and T triple Q's. I'm also running it. I think, yeah, I'm running it
2648.16s:  in Ibit. And then I also started it with GameStop. So I have a handful of the coverage
2653.12s:  triangles on right now. But that's the overall game plan currently.
2661.12s:  Australia says, how are you dealing with option liquidity on SSO and Upro? Liquidity doesn't matter
2667.36s:  really that much. So I'm not trading SSO. And SSO is I would argue better for people that just
2676.32s:  want to be uninvolved, meaning you don't want to trade it that much. Because the liquidity in
2682.32s:  SSO is entirely circumnavigable via something like the coverage triangle because there's just not
2687.36s:  that many round trips that are associated. Whereas via Upro, definitely more liquid. And it allows
2695.92s:  slightly more active management to be applied without taking as much out via friction.
2701.84s:  But the coverage triangle itself isn't really that high touch of strategy. That's the whole
2708.48s:  purpose of it. It's why I built the strategy the way I did is because it's designed to give me
2714.40s:  market beta with a slightly enhanced return profile that's not high touch that allows me to
2723.12s:  also realize gains as we move along. So I think in here, I show you the GameStop.
2732.00s:  Coverage triangle is from the video yesterday. One of the things that I wanted to show you was this
2738.40s:  here. Where GameStop itself is, I think it was up like 26% and 29% respectively when I first
2750.96s:  looked at this. So the difference here though is if we take a look at GameStop, even how the
2757.52s:  coverage triangle is performing right now, one of the things that the position has, which hold on,
2764.32s:  I'm actually, this is missing this. I was wondering what was wrong with this. This should be W.
2774.88s:  It's because I copied this over 12, 233. So one of the things that this has going in at
2787.44s:  its favor, the coverage triangle versus just holding the shares in GameStop on a comparative basis,
2794.16s:  is there's, oh, that's why hold on, I'm sorry. These are wrong.
2802.96s:  This should be 19. I have to get rid of the lock for when I copy and paste this over so it's not
2810.56s:  wrong. 41. The main difference here though is for the coverage, what the
2823.84s:  the coverage triangle as it's designed doesn't rely just on unrealized gains. It also allows me to
2832.16s:  benefit from realized gains. If this number calls me back, I'm going to pick it up just because I
2839.84s:  have no idea who it is or what it is or why they're continuing to call. So primary difference. GameStop
2851.92s:  here, if you're holding the shares, you're doing well. You're up 30% over this comparative time frame,
2857.52s:  but all of that is unrealized gain. If you look at it from the coverage triangle perspective,
2862.96s:  you have, albeit very small, but you do have a, you do have a realized gain, which is great.
2873.68s:  Oh, this is finally from Bear Canada. I'll call them back in a little bit.
2881.12s:  They've already pissed me off, so I'll deal with them in a little bit.
2889.12s:  So yeah, that's one of the really cool parts about the coverage triangle as it sits and why it is
2897.60s:  solid strategy for stuff like this. And it's why I use it, honestly, is part of my core holdings
2905.36s:  because it's really, really dynamic and it's very simple to manage, which is super convenient.
2914.40s:  So the whole point of this tangent and going down this path is to try to give you some ideas
2924.08s:  as you're defining your goals and what you're trying to target for the year, some different ways
2930.24s:  and methodologies that you can do that. And one of them is by using something like this.
2935.84s:  I've talked about it a ton. I literally have an entire playlist built around the strategy itself.
2944.00s:  Go to for me, it is a old, well, not really that old, but it is a absolute go to strategy for me that
2952.80s:  I've run for some time. And I will very, very likely continue to keep running it because it benefits
2963.52s:  it just it benefits the overall portfolio in a really, really nice way. And it's easy to manage
2971.92s:  like pretty significantly easy to sweet. So let's talk a little bit more now about creating targets and
2981.76s:  goals for the year. So for the new trader, we already talked about what I would consider to be
2986.88s:  the initial target that makes the most sense. And that initial target is simply
2993.76s:  setting up a greater than zero return, right? That's the initial target for a brand new trader.
3001.68s:  Now the way that you achieve that is again, if you just focus on make more than zero dollars,
3009.52s:  who knows where you actually land? That's why I think for a small account, new account that's
3018.80s:  just starting greater than zero baseline. And then above that, I would pick something that you're
3023.92s:  comfortable with. It doesn't have to be much. You could pick 5% return, 2% return, like something
3029.28s:  like that. And the reason why I think that's a important component to it is because you're giving
3037.76s:  yourself a distinct target to shoot at. But again, you have to remember one of the issues with
3048.16s:  building your return profile is that a lot of people, they just inherently get way too aggressive.
3057.68s:  Meaning they want to have this really, really big return because that's what their mind wants
3064.32s:  to see at the end of the year. That's dangerous. That's really, really dangerous. And the reason why
3069.92s:  it's dangerous is because we start to, like I've literally have had people ask during some of my
3077.28s:  mentoring sessions, they'll say something like, do you think this return is possible?
3082.88s:  And the first question I always say, well, the first part of that is, if you have to ask,
3089.36s:  you already know the answer. The second component to it is,
3098.08s:  when I see the largest return targets, it's for people that have this grand plan on a road map
3109.20s:  where they're trying to land. And that's good and that's okay. The problem with it though,
3119.44s:  is more often than not, when we start thinking about our lives, we start thinking about what we want to
3126.24s:  do, what kind of travel we want, what kind of house we want to buy, where what kind of work we don't
3130.96s:  want to have to do anymore. We start to think like, okay, like, yeah, I need a little bit more money,
3135.20s:  I need a little bit more money. And then you're like, okay, well, I now need to have five million
3140.40s:  dollars. And I don't want to work for 30 years. I would love to be out in the next 10. So I'm going
3145.28s:  to use 10 years as my planning factor, my starting amount of capital is very small. I have a
3149.84s:  hundred thousand dollars. So how do I go from a hundred thousand dollars to five million in 10 years?
3155.44s:  Right? Like, you could see the problem built into this. And it's because we're crossing our desires
3162.72s:  with what's possible or rational. And you have to be rational in the way that you build this,
3169.92s:  because I'm telling you, like, if you are not rational about it, you're, you're really going to set
3176.32s:  yourself up for failure. You're going to make this not achievable for you, which is unfortunate,
3183.12s:  because there's no reason for it to be unachievable. But that's typically what ends up happening to people.
3192.00s:  So that's something to keep in mind. All right. All that aside, I wanted to just share some of
3199.60s:  those broad thoughts with you all specifically for the newer traders, kicking off the new year.
3205.52s:  Now, we have a little bit of time left. Happy to bullshit or answer any questions or anything
3211.84s:  that you may or may not want to talk about. And if you do have some stuff great, if not, what I
3216.56s:  want to do is actually start building this syllabus. And the reason I want to build the syllabus
3221.84s:  together for the outlier options trading bootcamp series is because I talk to you all about
3230.96s:  building your own syllabus. So it would be a chance to do that together. All right.
3238.24s:  Let me see. Lauren says, Eric is about to go off on the airline. Can you record that call and post
3246.32s:  the video? Yeah. That's this has been a battle that I'm going on for some time. Yeah. It's been
3258.96s:  super frustrating.
3265.52s:  Actually, this is them. I'm going to answer it. Hold on.
3906.32s:  Name of the game is be disagreeable. That's what it comes down to. So we just wrapped that up.
3914.32s:  And it looks like we have a beginning to a resolution, but we're not quite there yet.
3922.32s:  So let me get through the rest of the chat really quick and see what else we want to cover really,
3930.32s:  really fast before we wrap up. Let me see. Tommy says I picked a 6% return for 25,
3939.04s:  gives me a monthly target. Yeah. And I think Tommy for something like that, that's like a really good,
3944.80s:  you know, beginners target. That's not something I think is suitable for a longer term or target,
3951.36s:  just because you obviously want to just like as a more seasoned trader, you will want to return more
3958.96s:  than that in case you need it. More or less, the broader return should be done in the context of
3967.28s:  either trying to drive top line returns or to reduce drawdowns, reduce portfolio volatility,
3972.32s:  something like that. Let me see.
3985.36s:  And it looks like.
3992.96s:  Tommy says I'm a beginner trader. Yeah, good. Yeah. Then I think that that makes a lot of sense.
3996.96s:  That's good. I dig that.
4002.64s:  Perfect. Shreys says Thor busy looking through book for 2024. Thor is, I think he has,
4012.64s:  yeah, he's not even in here anymore. Thor balanced. He was ready for, ready for his dinner.
4023.36s:  So before we wrap then let's do this. I want to work on the syllabus with you guys.
4030.32s:  And I would like
4036.64s:  to build it with you. Okay, cool.
4040.56s:  So I already had it started.
4047.60s:  Runtini says Eric, you should make some merch like flashcards.
4053.68s:  I don't know about no flashcards. If you want to make them for me, let me know. You can keep the money.
4059.92s:  Let's do here. This will be
4065.52s:  outlier options trading basics. This has to be an acronym outlier options trading bootcamp
4075.92s:  syllabus. And here's how I intend to break it down.
4090.24s:  Let's do.
4097.92s:  I guess the first thing is how many episodes do we want to do?
4105.92s:  Because I think depending on that, it will change how many things go into this.
4111.60s:  So let's do a market recap.
4122.40s:  This would be things like exchanges, brokers, participants.
4136.08s:  Securities, that kind of stuff.
4141.76s:  Then we would do a derivatives recap. So this is options, futures, purpose,
4154.64s:  and traits. Then we would do options.
4165.52s:  We will do options, history. Then we would do
4175.28s:  elements or components, I should say.
4184.96s:  An option, settlement.
4193.44s:  We want to do Greeks,
4195.20s:  the Greeks,
4197.20s:  the utility.
4203.04s:  I think that's most of the recap stuff. Then we would move into intermediate.
4211.20s:  This will be things like, oh, hold on.
4225.28s:  This is crazy. So the exact thing that I thought was going to happen is what's happening.
4248.16s:  They're pointing the finger.
4267.04s:  These people are crazy. All right. We'll let them stew on that for a moment.
4271.84s:  Now, for the intermediate stuff, we'll take a look at the big four or no, the outlier
4280.16s:  strategy process, outlier trade process. We'll want to look at things like interaction
4290.32s:  between delta and gamma. We want to look at
4301.04s:  delta gamma theta theta.
4310.64s:  Then we will want, what else would I consider intermediate?
4318.08s:  We'll look at technical analysis, fundamental analysis. We'll take a look at
4325.76s:  types of base strategies. This will be things like
4335.12s:  creating volatility,
4337.60s:  traction,
4342.40s:  et cetera.
4347.04s:  Then we'll take a look at
4356.40s:  the distance of start. Then we can build on this as we go.
4360.32s:  Because I'm going to have some quizzes for us along the way. Then the quizzes are going to help us
4366.56s:  dial in what stuff like out of this that we want to spend more time on.
4377.60s:  This will be what it starts to look like. We'll either start it next week or the week after,
4382.16s:  not fully determined just yet.
4386.08s:  So, that wraps me up. My dinner got here. So I'm going to go eat. If you guys need anything,
4391.12s:  let me know. Hit me up in the discord. Be in outlier. I'll see you all later.
