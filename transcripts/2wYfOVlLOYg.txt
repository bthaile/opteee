0.00s: This is an example of a trader who thinks they learn something, but unfortunately they completely miss what they're supposed to learn.
9.00s: They say, agree taught me a very valuable lesson.
12.00s: They've been trading for almost 20 years, they started with 25K consistently made $500 a day,
18.00s: then they would exit 2% return on a Vesic Capital every day that they do choose to trade, which isn't every day.
26.00s: It says it's not much, but it's adding up made a mistake, what my account trying to go for more lesson learns to stop when you met your goal.
32.00s: Even if it's $5 10,000 take the win, shut it down, greed gets you nowhere.
37.00s: I'm basically back to my initial 25K, still motivated.
40.00s: I'm fine with $500 each day I trade.
43.00s: Here's the problem.
44.00s: This person has smoked crack cocaine and has the most contorted skewed perception of reality that I could conceive of.
52.00s: Let's talk about it.
53.00s: If we looked at their first scenario of 25K making that 2% 500 bucks, that places them at a 14,597.5% return.
72.00s: That doesn't seem pretty reasonable to me.
75.00s: Let's give them the benefit of the doubt, because they say that they don't trade every day.
79.00s: What happens if they do this each week?
83.00s: That's still a 180% return.
87.00s: So unfortunately, this trader believes that they've learned about greed.
91.00s: The funny thing is, is that this isn't actually about greed at all.
95.00s: This is about having completely false expectations of what trading is, what's possible.
101.00s: And this is just utter lack of planning.
104.00s: That's all.
105.00s: You can see I just threw it in a calculator that took me 20 seconds to build.
109.00s: And you can see that even this, I'm fine with 500 each day I trade.
115.00s: This is crazy.
117.00s: They're fine with a 14,000% return, even if they change this to each week I trade.
123.00s: That's 180% return.
125.00s: So this is simply a function of somebody who hasn't done any requisite research before they start trying to do this.
133.00s: And they set themselves up for failure.
135.00s: Be an outlier see you later.
