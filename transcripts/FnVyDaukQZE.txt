0.00s: What's up, everyone? Welcome to the outlier podcast. I have my friend and doppelganger, Eric. What's up, Eric?
9.00s: You and I have connected for a while now, but I don't think we've had a chance to like actually get together for a podcast on my channel at least. So welcome. Thanks for coming to hang out for a bit.
20.00s: Yeah, absolutely. I know. Yeah, we've had a we've been on my podcast a couple times. We've had a couple conversations that we wish we had turned into a podcast. And so it's always good talking to you and talk about our approaches and this might be my first video podcast. So this will be interesting for me.
39.00s: Yeah, cool man. Glad to be here. You look great. And I always feel like I feel like I provide like a good benchmark, right? Like I'm the ugly friend. So I always make other people look better. Yeah, you're welcome. I'm doing. Okay, thanks. I always thought I had a face for radio, which is why my my shows always audio.
57.00s: Yeah, I mean, I don't disagree with you, but I definitely also have a worse face. So now, man, jokes aside, it's great to catch up. So I thought with you to kind of dive a little bit into your background and we'll get into more recent stuff.
75.00s: But I think it would be useful context for people that may not be familiar with who you are, what your background is, or even your own audience that might not have all the blanks filled on what your background is. I thought that would be a cool place to start. So walk me through specifically when you got into derivatives and why.
96.72s: Okay.
98.32s: So from a background standpoint, I don't have any sort of financial background.
105.08s: How far do you want to go back? You want me to start wherever you started with derivatives? If that's rewound post.
111.48s: I'll go back a little bit further because so when I went to college here in Florida, I started out as a math major.
120.72s: And I ended up changing to education and taught like middle school, math, like algebra, that type of thing. And I did that for a few years.
130.12s: I was a musician. I was a percussionist and marching band type guy.
136.64s: I played drums at Disney around that time. And so this was
141.44s: this was the early 90s in Florida. And in case you didn't know, I think Orlando was like the rave capital of the world. So for a few years, I got into DJing and music and I had this drumming background.
157.04s: I ended up going back to school for networking like Cisco networking, IT stuff. And then I got into an IT career that I was an IT administrator for about 15 or maybe 16, 17 years. I did networking.
174.04s: We did all the physical to virtual transition and then virtual to cloud and was ultimately ended up being like an infrastructure manager.
182.04s: But when I started my IT job, where I got into or first learned about derivatives is I went to a seminar. I think it was called get motivated and it had like a bunch of different people like real estate people.
196.04s: I don't even know who who all the people were. But one of the guys was from thinkorswim. And they started talking about options.
206.04s: I'm sorry. Do you remember who it was?
210.04s: I want to say it was Phil town. God, that name rings a bell.
216.04s: And I remember he had this joke. It was like, so he brought up his thinkorswim account. And I can't remember. So sorry, let me back up a bit. So they did this free thing. And then they did it.
232.04s: And then they offered a class for thinkorswim and an options course. So I my buddy and I they let you pair up. We bought like this sort of advanced class where we learned about options and we learned about credit spreads.
248.04s: So in that class, the guy and I think it I think it was Phil town and I could be wrong in that. But the I just remember this funny thing where he he brought up his thinkorswim account and he's like, okay, here's how you buy an option. And he's and you know he wasn't trying to trade. He was just, you know, mechanically how to do it.
267.04s: And he had his balance showing he had a million, he had a million dollar, like a million dollar account and he was buying these options and any any said, he goes, oh, you know how you get, you know, you know how you get to a million dollar account and he's like, oh, you start with two million. And I was like, everyone laughed. There's like this huge, you know, kind of funny things we were talking about, you know, losing money and that type of thing. But I think this was around
291.04s: 2004 or early 2000s when I took that class. And so I just started messing around with mostly SPY at the time and kind of doing more directional things like technical I got into technical analysis.
310.04s: That was one of the things that they were sort of touting was there was an indicator and they called it the three green, you know, if you got three green arrows, it was a buy signal. I can't remember exactly what it was, but that was kind of my introduction to all that whole world was was going to a seminar and basically paying money to take a class.
333.04s: Now, when you first saw options, I find people have different experiences with it for me. It was immediate intrigue. I was just fascinated by these things. What was your initial reaction?
346.04s: So I assume at that point you were familiar at least with like basic equities and you know, just general stark mark, yes, but when you saw options, what was your initial response?
359.04s: It, you know, I thought it was and what I was told I guess was more about if you don't have a lot of money, this is a way you can start trading to where it would be significant enough for you to do so. So if you had $1,000 and you know, you want to buy a stock and you want to be diversified or whatever, like, you know, you're not going to be able to do that.
388.04s: Like, you know, you're not going to buy one share of this and one no like no one's no one has the interest in it. It's harder to stay interested when you don't really have enough skin of the game or you don't want to put a lot of skin in the game.
402.04s: So to me, the initial interest and intrigue was, oh, this is something I can do on the side where I can kind of define my risk. I don't have to risk that much.
414.04s: You know, I can, you know, practice, if you will, with, and that was another thing at the time, think, or swim had a paper, and they still, they still did a paper trading.
426.04s: So you were able to sort of practice before you put real money to work and then you could put real money. But so for me, the, the thing that kind of interested me the most was doing like directional trades where you're using single options to.
442.04s: Basically, as a stock replacement strategy. So then it was more about well, if you're out of the money, you really have to have it to move and you have more premium or excuse me, Greeks against you.
454.04s: Or as if you buy in the money, it's a little bit closer to stock replacement. So that's kind of where I started with all that.
461.04s: Got it. And did you have anything in the beginning that kind of stuck with you that made sense at the time, or was it all just this seems like something I'll try this seems like something I'll try.
473.04s: Was there anything that you kind of navigated towards naturally?
477.04s: Well, part of the class I took was was credit spreads. And I ultimately kind of reverted back into that because it just to this day.
489.04s: And I think, you know, I didn't take the advanced class that they had, which was like a 10 or $20,000.
498.04s: And I think that's a really good thing. But they were kind of counting as a college and they were going to teach you all the other fancy strategies, but.
507.04s: But I think, you know, credit spreads is kind of what I sort of remember a lot about because they did a pretty good job of explaining in.
519.04s: And option terms, what, you know, what it is and, and you know, bearish neutral and you don't, you don't have to be all the way right.
529.04s: You just can't be really wrong and those, those type of things.
532.04s: And that kind of appealed me at the time. I think it appeals to a lot of beginners still because.
537.04s: Because it's, you know, a way to def, you know, it's defined risk, you know, exactly how much you can lose in case something goes wrong.
545.04s: But you don't always have to be 100% right. So that kind of stuck with me for a while. And then as I got more into technical analysis, I kind of threw the options out of was more.
557.04s: Not through the options job, but I, I focused less on the option and selection was more like, OK, I'm trading a 30 minute chart. I'm going to buy an option that's 30 days out and look for like swing trades and stuff. So.
571.04s: So yeah, I think, I think from that period of time, what's what I've sort of reverted back to and thought mostly about is credit spreads and, and how you can use those as leverage, even though you're not as leverage is single options.
587.04s: Some of that makes sense.
588.04s: But it does. Yeah, well, I mean, to your point, if you're using something like a credit spread, you'll always see a better return on invested capital.
596.04s: And yeah, it's, yeah, your capital efficiencies is exactly as good. Yeah, yeah, it provides a little bit of a different, a little bit of a different risk profile.
608.04s: But they're, they're very, very capital efficient, obviously. So walk me through then the way that you progressed, you saw credit spreads, you shockingly turned down the $20,000 course, which by the way, apparently you and I need to get off a YouTube.
626.04s: And we need to just are doing $50,000 courses and teach people basic option structures is what I'm here is that word of the idiots.
636.04s: So, you went through, you know, credit spreads, you tried some of these other stock replacement strategy swing trading applications started navigating back to credit spreads.
646.04s: What's the timeframe that this is happening over what period of time are you kind of flowing between these?
652.04s: It was, you know, it was like a couple years. I'm trying to remember exactly. It's been, it's been a long time.
662.04s: I was doing credit spreads and that was boring.
667.04s: And so I wanted something more exciting, which was kind of more, I just call it like short term swing trading. I wasn't day trading because at the time, you know, I was still working and couldn't, you know, I wasn't going to try to do that.
682.04s: And also at the time back in, you know, it's called 2010 or so.
691.04s: They didn't, they only had explorations on Fridays. So it wasn't, there wasn't kind of the same mania that there is today where you're like, man, you can wake up and like, there's something to do every day if you want to, you know, where is back then when they only had Friday explorations, it was like, OK.
710.04s: If I'm going to do a swing trade on them Tuesday, should I wait, you know, to otherwise, I got to, I got to choose three days out versus 10 days out. And there, there was kind of a little bit of choice that you had to make. It wasn't as granular.
726.04s: And so I, that kind of put in, you know, in hindsight, it pushed me out to trade farther out.
733.04s: Because when you, what I learned sort of inherently was that if you bought an option with three days of exploration, obviously, you need, you have to get the move that you're expecting in those three days or you don't make money.
750.04s: But if you're, depending on your analysis, if you're looking at something like a daily chart, you know, you might get a swing trade signal, you know, moving average cross whatever it is.
761.04s: And so you may want to let that play out longer.
765.04s: So you may want to buy 30 days out because if you get a really good swing, you want to hang on to that.
770.04s: And so there got, there got to be like the bunch of decisions that I had to make that, you know, and I didn't, I kind of just ended up at like 20 to 30 days because I figured, well, that's long enough, you know, it was very scientific.
786.04s: But then ultimately I got sort of reverted back to credit spreads, I was doing some vertical spreads to because on more expensive stocks, you can spread it off to reduce your capital. So, but there was still the same sort of swing trade mindset.
801.04s: But then I ultimately got back to credit spreads because it was just easier, if you will, you just can't be that wrong. So I, like, I got away from those signals, if you will, like, like pure technical Mac D, whatever signals and just try to look at, hey, is the general trend up.
826.04s: Yes, let's sell some puts or put spreads or whatever. And so then you fast forward to, I think it was 2016 when they added Monday, Wednesday, Friday, expirations for SPX, I really started focusing in on that because I could trade my shorter term stuff.
848.04s: More consistently, because I learned over time that.
853.04s: Part of your part of consistency is choosing the same duration.
858.76s: And with the the advent of now we have daily expirations, you can have a one day to expiration strategy.
867.04s: And you can trade it every day, as long as your setup is there, whereas in the past, if you wanted to do zero DTE, you could only do that on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and you can only do one DTE on Tuesday, Thursday, because technically Friday was a three DTE.
882.04s: So as technology and the options landscapes sort of has blown up over time, it's allowed for more strategies and more frequency. So what I've done, what I've ended up doing is really kind of just bringing everything back into for my trading, you know, and I'll separate investing from that, but for my sort of short term trading.
909.04s: Options trading, I pretty much just trade SPX, because I have multiple strategies, like one day, seven day, 14 day that I can put on.
921.04s: And I can get that consistent DTE now, so it can be a Tuesday and I can trade seven days, the expiration, you know, as before that wasn't possible.
929.04s: So, and I think over time, the technology available to retail traders has changed drastically, and I got into back testing years ago, with a couple, I think I started with CML, CML trade machine pro, which they still have a great platform.
950.04s: And, and then that's when I started like sort of honing my,
958.04s: honing my strategies a little bit more often fast forward today where I kind of created my own analytics to really increase my frequency, and kind of something you mentioned before.
970.04s: The one thing I like about the credit spreads is that they are capital efficient, and when you can increase your frequency with and continue a similar win rate risk reward, you can trade smaller and therefore more consistently.
988.04s: So that's kind of where I've ended up over the years and why I typically just trade SPX at this point.
996.04s: And two questions, the first follow up is in the early days, what was your original goal with trading, what were you trying to accomplish other than the fact make money, right, that's pretty clear, but beyond that, did you have any specific goals, like be we're trying to return a certain percent, were you trying to limit drawdown, how did that look?
1017.04s: My, so I lived through the 2008 financial crisis, and I was in my corporate job and you know had my 401k saw my 401k, you know, get cut in half.
1034.04s: And then wrote it back up like a champ, you know, luckily, you know, I was, my wife and I both luckily didn't lose our job, we didn't lose our how like we, you know, I feel very fortunate that I kind of just made it through there.
1048.04s: My boss and this other guy that was above me, they didn't make it, so I became the boss after that, that was.
1054.04s: But I think the promotion hell yeah.
1058.04s: So the, the, the GFC really kind of kind of woke me up and I'm trying to think a whole hell that was during that time, I was probably late 30s or mid 30s or so.
1074.04s: And it was just like, you know, you can save your whole life and it could just get wiped out, you know, and, and cash under the mattress isn't good.
1085.04s: So my whole thing and still to this day is like, okay, I want to learn, I want to be able to generate extra income from the money that I have in perpetuity, because everyone's living longer.
1103.04s: You know, you're probably going to outlive your money, you know, most of us, right, so it was really for me to learn a skill of making money without having to work a job or work, you know, and I had always kind of thought, okay, this is something I'll do in a retirement, because when I, you know, I was in the IT field.
1123.04s: And, you know, even in like elementary school, I did some coding with DOS and like I was always kind of a, Matthew, you know, we just call us spade, spade, nut, yeah, it's like kind of a little bit of a nerd there.
1141.04s: And, you know, being in IT for however many 15 years or so, you see life cycles of things, you know, like windows XP, windows seven, you know, I have an A plus certification in windows 98, I don't even know if you know what that is.
1159.04s: But, so, you know, like you, you go through these cycles and then at some point you're like, you know, am I, you know, am I going to be able to do this when I'm 50 60, like learn the next thing.
1173.04s: Most of the things that happened kind of went into the cloud and I sort of saw the writing on the wall where I was, I would joke with my co workers and like, oh yeah we're moving this to glad to the cloud i'm like i'm basically outsourcing myself.
1187.04s: And so it was just kind of this thing and I saw that from the very, you know, from the very beginning, I just wrote it out as long as I felt like it.
1195.04s: But so the goal was really just to, at the time is just learn the skill of making money, I already had a job, you know, and I was making six figures so it was like I wasn't trying to get rich, I just wanted to learn the skill.
1212.04s: And obviously options are complex and I kind of took that as a challenge to learn something complex.
1222.04s: Because I thought that would be a good way to well, you know, if I could learn this, I should be able to make a lot of money and then in hindsight, now I realize i've gone the other way and I do with the most simple way there is because it's just like it's.
1236.04s: And so I think we talked about that before, you know, the complexities, but so my, you know, to your question, my goal really was to just learn a skill.
1245.04s: Outside of what I had been doing and with the idea that maybe when I retire, I can have extra income.
1253.04s: Or, you know, maybe retire early, obviously, so.
1258.04s: And you did that right you made the jump early, I remember I think when I had met you, did you just make the jump or were you just making the jump I can't remember temporally when that was like really close to the end.
1271.04s: I quit my corporate job.
1274.04s: Or four years ago, I would have met you literally like right as you were doing that that's yeah it's about right yeah four or five years I quit my corporate job now I still.
1287.04s: You know i'm running my app now alpha crunching that I started so there is a business there i don't you know i'm not ripped i wouldn't say i'm retired you know but.
1298.04s: But one thing to to note on top of that and I just want to deliver two points home for people, but one of them is you did make that leap of faith because I remember you started alpha crunching not immediately when you made the transition yeah.
1310.04s: So like you did take that leap of faith and I just I didn't know I was going to do alpha crunching when I left the job right that sort of came up after and it was sort of.
1321.04s: I was recommended to me by one of my followers who was interested in business and i'm you know I got an entrepreneurial thing you know in myself so.
1335.04s: But yeah it was it was you know kind of a leap of faith it was one of those things the management at my company was changing.
1345.04s: You know I didn't like certain things and the people I work with were great my boss and everybody was just kind of this you know I just i've been there for it was time for me to go.
1357.04s: You know and they made it easy so I just was like well i'm just going to trade full time and.
1366.04s: I need to go back and get another job I can i'm married my wife works we you know it's not like we had no income you know that type of thing we switched insurances from my company and her company so there's a lot of you know it's there's a lot of thought into that I you know I had a lot of other support for that.
1388.04s: But I felt like I could do okay i feel like I could get by and then it was like well let's just see how long this last and you know my my biggest concern was you know I've kids at that time we're in.
1403.04s: You know elementary middle school so that's these are expensive years.
1408.04s: So it's like so I can't just retire and just live off you know like thick stink or whatever so you know I still have to you so if you want to provide and and do all the things that that teenagers do you have you have to have some money coming in so.
1425.04s: Yeah it was definitely a leap of faith.
1428.04s: It was I think a little bit after coven it was kind of like.
1434.04s: What what are we doing you know like what what where do I want to spend my time you know i'd rather spend my time I'd rather make less money you know or less security of money and be able to take my kids to school and do all the things so i've been doing that for a few years and it's been awesome.
1453.04s: Whereas before working having a you know corporate job and trading you can imagine the money was a lot more but it was you know you weren't able to enjoy it it was more stressful and you know so it's kind of like a.
1468.04s: You know different phase I guess and I think coven had a little bit to do with that it was just kind of you know you wanted a break and enjoy what you have kind of thing.
1478.04s: Well I think there's there's a lot to that I want to dig into here the first thing that I want to make sure the audience is hearing you talk about.
1487.04s: Is what I consider to be one of the coolest parts about trading is that you can have different objectives for what you're doing so free to your exact point.
1499.04s: You decided that you wanted to make this leap and use options or trading in general not you know limit to that although that is what you're doing but trading in general as an income source right and as you said you had very realistic expectations about what the performance might look like but.
1519.04s: For you what was more important than having you know buckets of money and making a pool fill of gold coins that you can swim in was the freedom that you were using that to enable for you so that that's an objective to have I think a lot of people need to hear those specific kinds of things because most of us start trading trying to get fat stacks we're just trying to be rich right like that's the general thing that starts you and then you kind of get slapped in the face with reality.
1548.04s: And you're kind of like figuring out how this fits into your life and I just wanted to draw that point out for people because I think it's a fantastic point you found something that you could use to literally unlock your time slash your freedom which is massively awesome now let's talk about that transition a little bit because the other thing and that's why I wanted to give you your your flowers or call it out also specifically is that it it takes some balls or whatever else you ovaries it takes something.
1577.04s: To have a job and to say like I'm going to try to do this my own way with my own stuff and the cool part with trading is it's given take is that it is all you there's no boss there's no risk management there's no therapist there's no HR there's nothing it is just you all around there's nobody to point at that's not easy of a transition for people to make so leading into that transition.
1607.04s: When did you start thinking hey I could probably lean on this pretty heavy as like an income replacement quasi income replacement however you were framing that what was that time frame that you were like how far out from when you made the initial transition were you starting to say like there's some opportunity here for me.
1628.04s: yeah so you know I would I kind of look at it like so let's go back to the jet objective real quick yeah and this this isn't advice or whatever my top objective is just positive cash flow.
1645.04s: Yeah just you know the amount of money you have obviously can help with that you know if if you're doing dividends or whatever I didn't I didn't have that much money to just live off like a dividend type situation but so my thing was cash flow and then in the good years leading up to when I left I was pretty good about saving my money so I left and if you think about it from a business and then I'm going to go back to the jet objective.
1675.04s: What they would call this is like well how much runway do you have right so I left my job with you know at least one year of runway meaning if I didn't make any money I would I could be fine for a year and so I was like okay well.
1693.64s: I mean why wouldn't you why wouldn't you do that like at what point is you know I wouldn't call it F you money you know like I wasn't but it was pretty close which is why I left right so if you're working and you know you have to have a certain amount of money to do this so the more you save.
1711.88s: The closer you are and this is the same thing for retirement the closer you are to.
1716.52s: Unlocking your time and then when it comes to like cash flow you have to.
1725.32s: Can we link around that point just for one second because I think that's another really common thing I talked to traders about where they're like oh I'm trying to make my gas money with my trade money this week and one of the things that I try to talk them about is that exact thing the idea of.
1741.16s: Trance for me it was three years because I'm overly conservative I wanted three years of runway but talk to me about how you thought about building that because I think a lot of people when they're going through the transition they're thinking of I just want this freedom so bad that they focus on it a little too much and then it can sacrifice the ability to sustain the freedom that they're trying to make so you decided one year runway and that was your target and.
1770.52s: How did you arrive at that how early again in this timeline so if we think t zero is when you made the transition of full time trader how far back from t zero was it like okay I need to save one years worth of expenses for me to feel comfortable making this transition.
1787.24s: Yeah I wish I I could say I was that thoughtful about it what what really happened was I just saved money so if you.
1800.04s: So let's go back to you know goes back to how when I came out of college and we got married well it wasn't that soon but we ended up you know we were in debt right in the first few years of having kids we were in debt and I remember we actually I don't remember exactly how much but we ended up getting out of debt.
1830.20s: And so that's put me in a mindset if I never want to use a credit card again I want to pay cash for everything never want to have debt again other than maybe a car in a house kind of thing so.
1843.88s: I was building my savings not thinking I would leave my job I was building it so that whenever the shit hits the fan and I need to buy an AC or in Florida you know get into a car accident or I want to go on a trip I don't I I want.
1860.04s: Positive cash flow I don't want an extra bill to pay something off that you know so that was part of my thing forgetting you know I guess prepared for that which again wasn't really the plan the actual sort of catalyst for me leaving the company was was more of a kind of a not issue but just kind of a falling out I guess with with some of them and I was just like I'm just going to go you know but I was able to.
1890.16s: Not succumb to I didn't I didn't have to be a yes man to stay right there was a little bit of satisfaction like well I don't really need this as bad as you think I need this so and I just happened to have put in some good habits that that put me there so I had a way to make money trading.
1911.00s: Probably wasn't going to make as much as I was making trading and working but I had runway and I thought well if I can trade more.
1919.52s: And trade different things that I'm not able to with my job maybe I can actually make more trading and that actually worked out I was making more trading.
1928.52s: Then previously because I was able to focus on it so there was there was you know you took the chance of I took the chance of that but I wouldn't say that I was I was so strict.
1940.24s: Strategic and and like okay I'm going to save this much and I'm going to get you know $100,000 and then I'm going to quit or whatever the you know thing is so.
1949.28s: But I think I just started doing things that would be in my favor and then those can culminate at some point you don't know when and how that will culminate but that's how that kind of played out for me.
1961.96s: I love that point though and the reason why I love it so much is because it's so different than the way that I thought about it and that's the beauty and I think there's a lot of people that will identify with that modality because what you're highlighting is contrary to how I think about it which is having like a pretty well defined plan that I'm focused on executing like pretty consistently.
1988.72s: What you're highlighting is that if you adopt good general habits it kind of comes out in the wash.
1996.44s: You might not have to do all this bullshit that I do to figure out where you're going if you do the right things generally the right stuff you were in the right spot.
2003.48s: Yeah you get lucky you'll get lucky.
2005.68s: It's it but to your point it's putting you in a position to be lucky I think that's it's kind of like the that's really where you know luck essentially is able to come to fruition is when there's a lot of hard work to put you into a position to take advantage of it when it's there.
2022.76s: So you come up to this decision stuff happen at work and you're getting ready you're obviously it's not like I assume it's not like you go in Monday and you're like.
2035.00s: And I'm out of here today my guess is that there was a little bit of fourth thought before you actually pulled the switch there actually wasn't it.
2044.72s: Something happened on a Friday and and and then I resigned on Sunday on Sunday yeah yeah well still there's some.
2058.52s: So the funny thing was is and you know I.
2064.96s: I don't want to go into it too much I mean it wasn't anything.
2069.88s: But long story short so I had been doing YouTube and research and and I had a Patreon and I was posting like research things from various back tests I would done and was was kind of like building this little community around research.
2088.28s: Options trading research and I had a I had started my podcast and it was all these things I was doing outside of work and I had a YouTube channel so I.
2102.20s: To help pay for like the production because I couldn't do everything myself I had a production company if we want that's what you want to call it who would basically I would record my podcast I would give the audio.
2115.12s: They would create a video and post it like I just kind of because I didn't have time I was working right and and they would just post the stuff for me well.
2125.80s: They someone in HR or this executive person who didn't like the IT department.
2132.16s: Found out I had a YouTube channel and they thought I was making these videos like while I was working and so he might they pressured my boss to kind of give me a hard time and I was like well I don't actually post those videos and then it got into this whole like like another video posted on Wednesday at noon this week and I was like using how scheduling works bro.
2162.56s: Well in my boss know the guy that I you know knows and then I'm thinking I am working with the dumbest people right why literally literally the HR person they scheduled these emails to go out.
2177.64s: You think Susan is sending out this email at six in the morning you think anyone believes that shit and I was just like so you actually think and if you've seen in my videos.
2189.32s: They're pretty they're not like this.
2192.00s: Like off the cuff stuff.
2195.68s: There's a lot of time and effort I put into my videos to make them short and concise.
2200.52s: And I'm just thinking God either you guys think I'm a super genius or you're super dumb and either way like this isn't working for me and then then I had a chip on my shoulder and I was like so now I'm going to go back in and and try to like.
2215.36s: Like what's this going to be like moving forward right like now that you know I was annoyed and I was in my you know my wife's funny she was like you should have quit six months.
2230.44s: You know like she she was on board she wanted me to leave and I was like yeah you know and I had to think about it but then then when Sunday came around I was like I was like well I better.
2241.96s: Part of me was like I better quit because if I want to find another job I don't want to I don't want to like get into an argument and get fired or something done like that because that's where I was at I was ready to argue.
2253.56s: So I was like I don't need this I'm just going to risk I'm going to quit.
2258.20s: I had company shares they had to buy me out that added to my runway.
2263.16s: And so I was just you know kind of I put in a 30 day notice and.
2267.96s: Super generous yeah yeah because I didn't want to leave my boss hanging super generous and we're still friends I you know he still works there and you know but.
2277.96s: But it's just you know like the company culture was changing a little bit the management and like they they just weren't that savvy and um.
2288.32s: The the upper management was less technology forward which was harder for us and was like and it was just like this I don't need to i'm in doing this a long time like we know how this stuff works.
2298.84s: So that was a Friday and I I told my boss on Sunday.
2306.24s: So no.
2308.76s: I hate to say hey you can plan this out sometimes you just you know but but I go back to I you know had I also plan there.
2316.60s: Had I not saved my money and and learned from my previous debt mistakes from my teens and 20s.
2326.04s: And you know like I said COVID had happened I mean I didn't mention this but my mom had gone.
2333.48s: Into she had to go into a nursing home she had MS and I had to manage her house there was a whole bunch of things going on and I was just like.
2342.00s: cash flow simplify i don't need that much money i've been poor if i i'll be poor again if I need to like i don't care I just want like it the value of.
2353.52s: Doing whatever you want whenever you want me like that's it's just i'm being I live in Florida like I don't really have to go on vacation you know if I don't want to I can just go to the beach anytime I want so you know it's it's um.
2367.52s: You kind of go through some things I think covid put me through i'm i'm a little bit older than you so when you start to get to yours you know i don't say it's a second half of my life but probably is a second half my life it's like well.
2379.68s: What do you know what are we doing you want wheelchair wealth I think is what they call it where you work your ass off and you have a ton of money.
2386.52s: When you're 66 and a half or whatever the number is or do you want like just positive cash flow and enjoy it now.
2396.84s: And enjoy the time so that that was kind of part of the.
2402.44s: mindset of of making that decision with the idea that I could always go back to work if I needed to now I think that's harder to do because i've been out of the game for four years and the only thing I know is.
2415.68s: i'm narrowed my universe to a certain type of trading and and and mindset so could I get a job somewhere if I needed to maybe.
2425.08s: You want to maybe it's kind of boring you know sometimes like.
2431.32s: Like I have kids now but I know like when the kids are gone like I don't know maybe I want a job again.
2437.56s: Like there's nothing wrong with having a job.
2440.52s: I don't like it I loved my job for the longest time for the first 10 12 years I love my job and then the last few years I didn't love my job.
2448.96s: So you know there's nothing wrong with having a job.
2452.48s: trading is just a different type of job and.
2457.08s: It's sometimes it's good to have two jobs.
2460.16s: Well I think you hit on a bunch of super important points though the first one.
2466.24s: Is even though you didn't necessarily have the the road map you know on Friday that like Sunday i'm going to leave right the fact is as you still had put enough.
2479.36s: For thought into building the origin of the plan that you had built a runway into skill set that you could reasonably lean on and it was time to activate that I again I just highlight that for other people because a lot of my audience they're used to my way of doing things hearing me talk about my way of doing things which is.
2498.80s: Everything is very planned like essentially everything and I think it's really cool to hear so many elements of your story that stem from having a general plan but not necessarily you know the same approach that I technically take and it's still worked out well for you.
2515.44s: So.
2516.76s: The other thing that I want to highlight as I heard you kind of talking about that path though and the important point is that you would build enough of a skill set that you felt confident in making at least the crack at this.
2532.08s: Even though you had a year runway you weren't going into that thinking i'm just going to burn this full year and then find a job it sounded like you wanted to trade and like see how this does so.
2541.84s: Walk me through what steps you were taking leading into again t zero being the transition that built that confidence that built the background i'm saying.
2555.04s: Sunday don't feel like going to work Monday later nerds yeah.
2561.28s: Yeah well you know it was scary I you know.
2566.24s: I can say now for whatever five years later that was the best decision I've ever made or whatever but it wasn't a time it was it was scary we didn't know I didn't even know what to do like once I actually.
2580.68s: Actually finished work my last day was like the next week it was like okay now what you know because.
2588.84s: But.
2590.16s: Sorry what was the question again I got I got a track yeah totally cool I wanted to check in with how what you were doing trading wise what kind of.
2599.32s: Record you would build before you made the transition to think that this is something I could rely on it was a skill set you trusted to some degree.
2608.28s: Yeah so I have been doing.
2612.44s: I've been doing.
2614.68s: Really short term spx kind of income trades I've been doing longer term stuff i'm i can't quite remember the strategies at the time they're all relatively the same and again it was just really about cash flow.
2632.52s: And understanding that.
2636.52s: I think for anyone who you know i'm sure people know this but.
2643.16s: You don't always win and there are periods of time where you either lose or maybe you don't have strategies for because the market's not doing what your normal strategy is.
2654.16s: Or you know like like when we're talking the market sort of pulling back i'm not really doing a lot of trades right now because most of my strategies are kind of.
2663.40s: Bullish things so i'm kind of on the sidelines and in a lot but i'm I think.
2670.24s: um.
2672.24s: It it it just goes back to you know risk reward and cash flow and you know zero dte was coming more in play at that time.
2684.04s: And then I think it was at that time there was Monday Wednesday Friday so we could do zero dte three days a week.
2692.48s: And so that's kind of what I focused on and I i'd.
2697.32s: Got with a buddy of mine and we had done a bunch of research.
2701.36s: And we were putting out research on that and we had a community and we were buying data and we i think we've talked about this before we were buying data.
2710.88s: Together this thing we were selling the results so I did have a little bit of additional income with the research I had been doing which I have been.
2720.08s: Kind of already doing that so I you know I did have a little bit of income coming in that could probably.
2726.56s: pay the bills if you will and then.
2731.36s: Then we just focused on those strategies and that eventually.
2736.72s: Those we learn some things from those back testing and then ultimately I decided to get back into price action as opposed to options testing.
2746.92s: And that's when I got eventually launched alpha crunching in I think it was November 2022 which is about maybe two year year and a half after I quit.
2757.64s: So I did a bunch of research and realized oh okay.
2760.96s: For this type of style.
2763.36s: I really want to know more about price.
2766.88s: And and just being on the right side of price action so I kind of went over there and now I don't I don't venture out of my.
2774.08s: Option strategies very far anymore and I'm just really focused on on risk reward and probability.
2782.00s: Of the of the system that that we've kind of come up with so.
2787.92s: I think that answer your question.
2791.04s: Yeah and it's also good to hear that I mean you're you're really taking like a programmatic approach to it which is very cool.
2797.92s: Yeah so we have a few minutes left to you there's a couple of things that I wanted to hit with you.
2802.96s: The first one though is when you were devising your strategy in general before alpha crunching well I didn't know it kind of carried over into it.
2815.04s: But when you were refining through your strategy walk me through at a high level that process it started with back testing to some degree so you're using ideas but how did it go.
2827.60s: Most most of the strategies that I ended up testing were just it's you know it's very simple.
2837.28s: What I found over the years when it came to credits spreads and this is something that I don't think most other people do I think this is why.
2845.20s: I have my own thing going on is I trade a lot of at the money stuff.
2850.40s: I don't look at IV I don't typically try to roll or I don't I don't sell Delta five anything I used to so what I've kind of gotten into is like a sort of a fixed risk reward of at the money stuff and it's either going to win or it's going to lose.
2875.44s: So it there's no you know you don't know what's going to happen but I know how much I can win and I know how much I can lose and I know what that win rate is going to be consistently over time.
2887.92s: So I think over the years I eventually figured out and I get questions like this all the time where you know we'll sell put spreads and and doing we had a great couple months here until market turned down had some losers now we're kind of waiting.
2905.36s: And one of the we talked about this last time I think I had you on my show but one of the attractions of options to trade both sides and I think if unless you're extremely advanced I don't recommend trading both sides I don't I think with.
2926.40s: um credits spreads at least or even naked if you're selling strangles or whatever like you know if you don't know how to roll or adjust and those type of things like you have to be really careful because you can get blown out which that has happened to me I mean even recently I was selling that was doing some iron condors and I had to like.
2947.04s: I had to adjust and roll because um because that's what the market was going straight up but I think um.
2954.40s: My the strategies I end up focusing on I think fallen line with what the market typically does and typically the market goes up over time and some people call it positive drift or whatever and so one thing I like to tell people is I trade a lot of put credits spreads mainly because the market tends to go up the market goes up slower than it goes down.
2983.12s: And so when you start introducing things like time and and and options trading if you have time the market will tend to recover and come back up obviously that when there's a bear market that doesn't happen and you have some things that tell you that when it's a bear market but um so I think really narrowing and focusing on one strategy um instead of trying to trade.
3013.28s: And also instead of trying to trade every market environment there's just certain market environments that are going to be different like right now that you know.
3024.56s: Also if you sell call spreads.
3028.52s: Every time the market goes down you will lose money because most of the time it recovers and the one time it doesn't recover isn't enough for you to make up the losses on the ones that it did that it didn't recover or it did recover excuse me.
3042.76s: So things don't work in reverse I guess is what i'm saying when you're looking at long and short side if you're a what I call a real options trader which means you are trading the Greeks and you're trying and probably I consider you kind of in that camp where you're trying to capture the risk premium and there's the whole another it's a whole other thing um that's awesome.
3068.52s: i'm more like hey the market's going up let's leverage the shit out of this until it stops going up and now it's not going up and i'm just going to not do anything for a couple days a couple weeks shit it might be two months before i get anything significant off.
3085.08s: And you know i'll do zero dte all the time because you can kind of that that's sort of like a bread and butter but when the market's in sort of like like it's like it was in i don't know may june or so.
3097.88s: I laid off zero dte and we were just doing one day seven day and just.
3103.64s: Rode it all the way up and now we're back now the markets down we're out of those trades and doing a little bit of zero dte because.
3111.92s: If you know if things kind of set up right so I think you just got to know yourself and what.
3117.16s: What you understand.
3119.52s: And what you can sit through and you have you have to be able to lose and watch i don't know watch it lose and not do anything.
3130.40s: So it comes down to your strategy, I guess and i i've just kind of.
3134.64s: Got into the point of and i'm not all the way there about 90% of there just taking the trade that that your setups there and just letting the math play out.
3144.48s: And I try to do things that don't require very much adjustment and i'll just take the loss when it comes.
3151.56s: So yeah yeah it's awesome and the place with that but yeah no it's it's really cool and it's one of it's honestly it's one of my my favorite things about you is like I consider you both a friend but also a thought partner.
3163.80s: I think it's so important to get around people who see things and do things differently than you do necessarily you being the proverbial you.
3172.72s: Because like like you're talking about I mean i'm a degenerate bro like i'm trying to trade up down sideways and circles i want to trade balls it's going up i want to trade that stock is it's going down i want to trade post earnings announcement drift just out here slinging stuff but.
3190.00s: You highlight another approach that's worked really well for you and that's cool to me that's really really cool to me especially as a reflection of markets and how they are.
3202.48s: This space where you really and you hit it right at the end you have to identify what works or you you the individual.
3211.04s: Because to your point if you gave me what you're doing the probability of me being able to just sit there and let it do what it's supposed to do is probably low I would dork it up I would be like you know i'm.
3224.28s: At IV looks a little off I bet you I could come up with something here and then i'll just start tinker in which shit but that's that's the cool part about trading and options and like specific that you can really set things up that work for you so I love hearing about that for you.
3240.28s: Now the last thing I want to ask you and then we're going to have to do a whole other session.
3246.04s: About this build out of alpha crunching and stuff like that because you and I spend actually quite a bit of time talking about the idea I remember when you were going through the original development of it it was fascinating stuff.
3255.72s: Yeah and i want to make sure people hear more about that story but.
3259.20s: For the end of this session I actually want to pivot you to this big thing and it's something I don't know if you realize that there's so few of us.
3268.32s: That have gone through this process of like jumping into trading most people have one foot in one foot out like you said there's nothing wrong with having a job totally cool literally totally cool it's probably just a more efficient thing for a lot of people.
3282.48s: But a lot of people do aspire to the idea of unlocking their own freedom their own time that's why a lot of us start trading.
3290.12s: If you were to think about the primary steps you took to go from the trader that showed up to a thinkers one conference.
3299.84s: To the trader that was able to make the leap from a well paying job and trade your own book what were the primary muscle movements that that happened over that time frame that made it possible.
3312.96s: Definitely.
3316.48s: persistence and curiosity those things have to be there.
3322.48s: Because you will so I blew out a couple accounts in the beginning.
3330.48s: Oh yeah.
3331.48s: And so I you know I paid my tuition like all good boys do and.
3338.96s: I think it's it's just you know there's this thing like I want to I want to use the word ego right like I have a big ego I've learned to remove the ego from my trades but I haven't I have a big enough ego to to proclaim that I can do this.
3363.52s: So it's kind of this weird thing that in the beginning I had an ego that oh I'm smart.
3369.52s: I'm an IT guy I know things that nobody else knows.
3373.12s: And so I'm going to be able to figure this out and you know you everyone figures it out for a little while.
3379.68s: You know everyone fit you know it's what you eventually figure out is that you can you know I've seen these memes and it's like a guy looking in the mirror.
3391.28s: And the and the meme says it's not the bull market you really are a genius.
3398.52s: And it's so true where it's just like I remember and someone put me in my place it was a old friend of mine and he was kind of like a real estate guy and he knew I was trading and.
3409.96s: And I was I was doing options in a smaller account.
3414.20s: And I was being conservative and you know I think I was up 30 or 40% and he's like oh how's the options trading going and I was like great man I'm up 30% and he's like yeah so was everybody else.
3427.48s: And I was like and they weren't doing anything.
3430.52s: Yes.
3431.40s: And then so it's those little things that you you know understanding like like you're you know you're not a genius.
3442.60s: You're methodical or whatever.
3445.96s: But just just have having the confidence I guess to like keep going.
3453.28s: And I think ultimately like for me it was just like I'm just going to do this I love it.
3459.24s: I like just fascinated by the math part and just markets in general.
3463.68s: So if you know the whole finance piece is definitely interesting and how learning about how the world works.
3470.32s: I think that is what kept me interested because you're like oh whether you win or lose in the market did something crazy.
3475.76s: You're like well why would the market go up if there's bad economic reports and then you realize oh well the Fed prints money and that's like I never knew anything like I don't have any finance to go.
3487.20s: I've just kind of learned this stuff over the years.
3490.04s: And so you know you just have to have an interest and and be persistent with something and what I normally would tell someone the beginning is.
3500.44s: Just if you're going to trade options.
3503.84s: Find one thing one ticker maybe two or three you know one option structure maybe that's credit spreads or condors or whatever.
3516.16s: eight and just and just yeah just one set up I think starting with verticals is best because it's the low lower risk and.
3524.28s: And it kind of makes sense you can you can you know trade it directionally and then you can flip you know you do a verticals debit spread.
3533.12s: And it's kind of a directional you buy a call spread and you want to go up and then you eventually get to you flip that to a credit spread where you just don't want it to go down kind of thing.
3543.08s: And I think timeframe is it is important that you should try to focus on one timeframe so if you're working a day job you probably want to watch the daily chart maybe a four hour chart but don't come up with some strategy on a five minute chart because you won't be able to execute that consistently.
3563.28s: And then you're going to want to and you know at some point you have to say no i'm not going to take this trade and if you've sent if he's spent two hours in front of the computer.
3572.36s: And you've and you've been able to say no i'm not going to take this trade that that that means you're good but most people.
3579.80s: After two hours on the computer what will I got to do something and then they just take it or they they you know jump the gun or whatever.
3587.16s: So I think your time frame is important and your duration so if you're I think most people probably end up in the tasty trade world of 30 to 45 days and I think that's a good place to start.
3603.20s: But if you want to.
3606.44s: Make more and if you have more time you can then lower your timeframe I kind of kind of fractal fractal nature of it all.
3615.28s: You know and that's ultimately what i've gotten to is like okay we have options every day i don't trade zero DTE every day but I trade a lot of one DTEs now.
3623.40s: And I can be consistent with my ticker my duration my strike selection and it's just you know it's very.
3631.04s: Repetitive and you know the exciting part is.
3636.52s: It's boring to put the trade on the exciting part is is this one going to work once it's on you know you don't know till after so but not doing anything about it.
3646.52s: So yeah that's kind of where I do.
