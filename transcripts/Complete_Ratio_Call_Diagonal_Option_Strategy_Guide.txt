0.64s: today we're going to talk about my
2.36s: absolute favorite bullish options
5.00s: trading strategy the ratio call diagonal
8.84s: I've talked about these before the goal
10.68s: of this video is to refresh what you've
12.76s: heard maybe integrate some new data
14.96s: points and then walk you through
17.28s: holistically how this strategy works so
20.40s: this is what we're going to cover what
22.48s: the profit mechanism is how I think
25.12s: about setting it up how I manage it and
27.08s: I'm going to give you an example of a
28.48s: recent trade using this exact strategy
31.84s: so what is a ratio called diagonal well
36.76s: first let's start with how it makes
39.68s: money which is just generally a
43.48s: directional strategy bullish and nature
46.48s: because we want things to go up in this
48.88s: case and it's really designed to be an
53.56s: equity replacement so rather than buying
56.76s: shares of a stock I would run this
60.80s: strategy for very similar thesis so I'm
64.16s: looking for things that are moving up so
67.28s: what is the structure for the strategy
70.60s: well it's these pieces here so I'm going
73.88s: to start with buying to open in the
76.76s: money calls that are typically greater
80.12s: than 60 DTE let's talk about this one
83.20s: first why in the money because it gives
86.76s: me better movement with the underlying
89.64s: which I'll explain what that means how
91.92s: far in the money for me typically at the
94.32s: very least 60 Delta for the long options
97.88s: if not further very often it will be 70
100.80s: 80 something like that so this is the
103.32s: first leg the second leg would be short
106.88s: out ofth the money calls that are
108.60s: generally less than 40 DTE and there's
111.88s: kind of very specific criteria that I
114.08s: use in terms of what Delta slash what
117.16s: strike I choose which we'll talk about
120.04s: and then there's the optional kicker
123.00s: options that I add to the trade so this
127.24s: is a way to make a little bit more money
130.28s: if the trade moves big in my favor so
134.20s: the base for this trade is this right
136.56s: here it is the long calls the short
140.16s: calls are an ancillary SL enhancement to
144.08s: the trade and then the kickers are kind
146.48s: of a tertiary add-on these don't always
149.36s: go on neither does the short calls right
152.04s: away these are also typically phased in
154.80s: I manage them slightly differently so
156.96s: this is the entire structure now I want
159.64s: to walk through how I actually set this
162.84s: thing up so that you can visualize it
164.84s: with me let's hop over to the platform
168.00s: and let's start with the long leg the
171.32s: long call so typically I would conduct
174.76s: my standard analysis whatever that looks
177.56s: like for you and what I'm looking for
180.04s: are things that are going up so in this
183.68s: case I look at Nvidia and let's say I
186.20s: have a bullish thesis on it it looks
188.16s: like it's pulling back now to be clear
190.44s: this actually isn't something I probably
192.00s: would trade with this just being honest
194.04s: mostly because it looks like it's at a
195.88s: bit of a capitulation point I would want
197.56s: to see it rallying a bit more and it has
199.88s: earnings coming up but let's just use it
202.12s: as an example so let's say that we have
204.60s: a bullish thesis in Nvidia there's a
207.56s: couple ways you can trade that you can
208.88s: just buy stock that's completely okay
211.72s: you can use this kind of strategy
214.28s: alternatively so let's take a look first
217.00s: at that initial leg the long call now
220.76s: you'll notice all these different
221.84s: expiration cycles and the very first
224.64s: thing as I mentioned is that I like it
226.36s: to be at least 60 DTE if not more why is
230.36s: it at least 60 it's very simple it's
233.52s: because I want to decrease the amount of
236.52s: theta that's bleeding out of the options
240.04s: and then I also want to give the trade
242.04s: more time to work so what does that look
245.16s: like let's take a look at these 60s now
248.00s: if you'll recall from some of my 101
251.08s: videos if you haven't checked out that
253.28s: playlist you should it was a YouTube
255.56s: live series that I did options trading
257.56s: for beginners and there's a couple
260.32s: things that we know the further you go
262.28s: out in time the slower Theta Decay
265.96s: although the more overall Theta there is
269.32s: so Theta in this context is just time
272.44s: value so when we go out 65 DTE we are at
275.84s: the very beginning where Theta de faster
279.16s: really when it starts closing within 60
282.44s: DTE now when I look at these kinds of
286.04s: positions you can decrease your Theta by
288.88s: going further out in time the other
290.84s: component is the further in the money
292.68s: you go the more money you pay but again
297.20s: the less Theta there is the less time
300.48s: value there is in the option why is that
303.92s: because the deeper in the money you go
306.28s: the more intrinsic value it has which is
309.92s: simply how far in the money it is and
311.92s: the less extrinsic value it has and a
315.84s: quick back of the napkin way of looking
317.48s: at this is let's say for example we look
320.12s: at these 50 Delta calls the 122s this is
324.60s: all extrinsic value these are completely
326.84s: out of the money now if we go to say for
330.16s: example these 70 Delta calls they're
333.88s: trading let's just call it $18 for
336.12s: Simplicity well that's $18 total of that
340.08s: $18 you can see by looking across to the
343.32s: corresponding outof the money option in
345.12s: this case the out of the money put and
347.04s: you can see how much of that roughly is
351.84s: extrinsic value in this case that's
353.52s: about six bucks you can also just do the
355.92s: math right so you can take whatever your
359.12s: strike price is in this case the 107 you
362.28s: can subtract your strike price from the
365.84s: current price and that'll tell you how
367.92s: far in the money it is so in this case
370.40s: it's like $11 in the money give or take
373.96s: so you take $1 out of this that's your
378.00s: intrinsic value and then the results is
380.12s: your extrinsic value so in this case
382.36s: it's pretty close to this just a couple
384.92s: different ways to do that so we're now
387.92s: decreasing our Theta DEC in two
389.72s: different methods by going further out
391.76s: in time and further in the money now
394.64s: it's important to understand the
395.64s: drawbacks because this is more expensive
397.76s: and if you get an unfavorable move
401.52s: against you you have more potential loss
405.08s: than if you buy a cheaper option so
406.72s: again for example if I buy this 50 Delta
410.28s: call for $1,000 okay that's my Max risk
413.36s: whatever I pay in this case if I buy the
415.84s: 70 Delta call I'm paying $18 my risk is
420.04s: now
421.48s: $1,800 the reason why this doesn't
423.96s: bother me is because I'm I'm going to
425.96s: manage the trade so it's not going to
428.40s: come down to that but you should know
430.24s: that that exists just so that you
432.12s: understand how the strategy works so now
434.48s: let's figure out what the Theta Decay is
436.20s: in this case it's 9 cents per day or $9
440.48s: out of this total value and just for a
443.96s: comparison sake let's say instead of the
446.52s: 65 we go out to like 190
449.76s: DTE let's look at the same 70 Delta call
453.76s: and you'll notice that the Theta to K
455.08s: for these is 5 cents a day and then just
458.36s: an inverse let's say we go into this 37
461.76s: DTE expiration we look at those same 70
464.28s: Delta calls you'll notice that the Theta
466.52s: DEC is 13 cents or $13 per day so this
470.80s: is why I like going at the very releas
474.76s: 65 or 60 days out 65 Plus in this case
477.96s: just cuz it's the next primary expert
479.64s: ation now a couple other things with
481.96s: respect to expiration selection is I
485.20s: prefer primary expirations meaning
488.00s: monthlies and it's because they tend to
489.92s: be more liquid I have another video that
492.08s: talks about option liquidity inside and
494.84s: out and all the ins and outs of it so
497.08s: you can check that out to understand
498.64s: more of the details there but suffice it
500.56s: to say monthly expirations will have
502.32s: more liquidity so that brings us into
506.44s: most of the details around the long
509.72s: option but there's a couple more that we
512.20s: have to solve for so let's say we don't
515.40s: want to go to 65 because we know that if
518.56s: we hold it for you know two weeks we'll
520.92s: be in the steeper component of theta
523.00s: Decay so if we're expecting to hold this
525.32s: trade for a month or two maybe we go out
527.88s: here to the 15 no notice how I'm
529.92s: integrating how long I think I'm going
531.92s: to hold a trade for that's the nature of
533.60s: being an options Trader our positions
535.56s: are time bound so I'm going to estimate
538.04s: how long I think I'm holding this
539.16s: position for so if we go this 93 DTE and
543.68s: then we go in to the 71 Delta why the 71
547.76s: Delta well if you take a look again it's
550.40s: for liquidity this is a slightly more
553.72s: liquid strike than the surrounding
557.04s: strikes so also why this Delta why not
562.00s: these further out of the money Deltas
563.76s: that are cheaper well it's because these
566.56s: will move better dollar per dollar with
570.40s: the underlying so the higher your Delta
573.44s: the more expensive your option is but it
575.68s: also means you're going to see more of
577.44s: the move at a given point in time so in
580.68s: this case if Nvidia goes up a dollar I'm
582.88s: going to see
584.20s: $71 of a move so I don't see that full
587.00s: $1 $100 if you're using 100 Lots I don't
590.20s: see that full dollar I see 71 cents but
593.20s: I see the majority of it whereas if you
595.08s: go further out of the money if you grab
597.60s: one of these cheaper options that's a
599.60s: Delta well if Nvidia moves that dollar
601.84s: you only see 30 cents what's the benefit
605.24s: of these further out ofth money options
607.48s: well they typically have higher gamma
610.52s: now you'll notice that these options
612.20s: that are really far out in time all have
614.52s: really low gamma gamma is the rate of
617.60s: change of Delta this is how you see
619.84s: those options that compound thousands of
622.40s: percent because of gamma so in this case
626.56s: I wouldn't look to add those k kicker
629.80s: options this far out in time we'll talk
631.56s: about those in a little bit but those
633.28s: kicker options are designed to expose us
635.00s: to gamma that compounding effect so
638.96s: let's recap this long option let's see
641.72s: what it looks like if we buy 10 of those
647.00s: 15 nove 105 calls that we were looking
650.00s: at and we look at this option we'll see
653.36s: that it has defined risk to the downside
657.80s: and you'll see that it has unlim limited
660.24s: profit potential up and to the right
662.44s: generally positively sloping just like
664.40s: long stock so this is the base of the
667.92s: position now let's compare that to
670.12s: something like
671.76s: buying a th000 shares of
674.68s: Nvidia you'll notice that just long
676.96s: stock has unlimited downside potential
679.36s: same upside potential give or take but
682.20s: notice the difference that the positions
685.04s: cost in order to put on if we buy a
688.60s: th000 shares Nvidia at spot which is$
691.84s: 11729 that means you're going to have to
693.52s: put up
694.56s: $117,000 290 bucks to put that trade on
698.12s: if I want to gain access to similar
700.36s: exposure via the 10 105 calls the amount
705.60s: that I'm putting up for that position is
707.32s: a fraction of that cost so in this case
710.36s: it would
711.88s: be
713.44s: 240 time your 10 * 100 so it would be
718.08s: $21,000
719.92s: so it's much cheaper to put the position
722.24s: on with options this is where the
725.20s: leverage comes from I'm controlling
728.12s: essentially the same size position
729.76s: slightly less and if you know why it's
731.92s: slightly less throw it in the comments
734.36s: and then I'll answer why it's slightly
735.84s: less the reason why is because long
737.80s: stock is Delta one meaning this is going
740.52s: to act like 1,000 shares right out of
742.44s: the gate this 10 lot at the 105 is not
746.32s: actually Delta one so if we go to 15 no
750.56s: 93 days out and if we go to these 105s
754.88s: you'll notice something very different
757.48s: these are a 71 Delta so this means that
761.28s: your one lot gives you access up to 100
766.00s: shares that's if the Delta is a one that
768.48s: would be 100 shares so in this case your
770.72s: Delta is 71 so that means every one lot
773.92s: you have is actually behaving like 71
777.04s: shares so in this case this would be
780.16s: more so like 710 shares of Nvidia versus
785.60s: the Thousand that's why those look
788.12s: slightly different when you compare the
790.72s: risk profiles on them so a small admin
793.40s: note doesn't make a huge difference but
795.32s: you should know that your exposure
797.36s: whenever you put the trade on in the
799.24s: beginning is going to be relative to
800.72s: your Deltas not what it can be up to
804.68s: which is up to controlling 100 shares
808.08s: equivalent per one line
810.08s: so that's the long option now let's take
812.76s: a look at the kicker options the kicker
816.36s: options get added when I have strong
819.00s: conviction in something's going to move
821.72s: and the reason is what I talked to you
823.56s: about before because they have the
824.84s: ability to compound massively so if we
828.60s: go to these closer to at the money
831.56s: options here and you'll see that if I
834.08s: look at like these 32 Delta options that
837.44s: are 20 or that are 3 s days to
840.44s: expiration the 132s here they have a two
843.56s: Delta so that means that as Nvidia moves
846.60s: in my favor $1 I'm going to see 32 cents
850.52s: of the move and my Deltas are going to
852.68s: grow by two so this will go from 32 to
855.44s: 34 and so on and so forth as I get more
858.24s: and more moves in my favor so by adding
862.48s: the kicker option it gives your trade a
866.40s: pretty significant compounding
868.44s: capability but you're holding something
870.88s: that's decaying relatively quick so for
873.40s: example looking at these 132s again if
877.76s: we take a look at the Theta Decay on
879.40s: those it's 12 cents or $12 so you're
882.52s: going to lose 12 cents of your $4 35
885.96s: cents every single day and this is
888.40s: because they're still pretty far out in
889.88s: time as this gets closer and closer to
891.96s: expiration let's take a look at these
893.28s: nine DTE go to like a 30 Delta for an
896.32s: equivalent notice that the Theta de K
898.08s: now is like 20 C
899.60s: 22 cents so these options are like $2
903.24s: it's like 10% that's decaying away so
906.56s: you have to be really careful when
907.92s: you're adding kicker options or trading
909.56s: out ofth the money options like that
910.84s: it's kind of like playing Hot Potato you
912.88s: got to be really really thoughtful about
914.60s: those positions because they're decaying
916.64s: in front of your hands very
918.52s: quickly so that's the kicker options in
921.24s: a nutshell if you really have strong
923.52s: conviction if I do I'll add them but
926.32s: it's a really small part of the trade
928.52s: it's a much smaller allocation than the
930.12s: total trade gets then let's take a look
932.52s: at the short option so if you go back
934.84s: here you'll remember that we're looking
936.12s: at short out of the- money calls so when
937.80s: do those get added
939.72s: well sometimes they get added at the
942.92s: onset of the trade sometimes they get
944.60s: layered on as the trade moves the way I
948.16s: think about the short calls is that
950.60s: they're again secondary it helps me
954.12s: offset the cost of theta so if we take a
957.88s: look at this 20 SE M expiration cycle
960.60s: and we go to an option that's out of the
962.36s: money so maybe like these 134s I tend to
965.56s: pick something around a 30 Delta 20 to
967.72s: 30 Delta somewhere in there on the
969.68s: initial and let's take a look at what
972.52s: these do for us they bring in about
976.88s: $385 so if we think about what the Theta
981.20s: Decay is on our 15 nove
985.12s: 105s and this shows us our Theta DEC is
988.40s: 7 cents per day so $7 per contract we
992.56s: have 10 contracts so we're losing $70
995.44s: per day in Theta and if I take a look at
998.60s: these short calls well realistically
1002.40s: right out of the gate one of them if I
1004.88s: collect is
1006.16s: $385 will cover the cost of my Theta at
1009.64s: least for a little bit not entirely
1012.96s: right it's just one day of theta that
1014.40s: I'm calculating there so but that's just
1016.56s: for a one law so if we take a look at
1019.20s: what this trade looks like once we layer
1021.40s: in some of these short calls it kind of
1023.92s: takes this kind of shape so one thing
1026.88s: you'll notice that's very different
1028.52s: about the way that I trade and why
1030.04s: they're called ratio called diagonals is
1033.56s: in this case you'll notice that there
1034.76s: are
1035.92s: 10 of the long options but only three of
1039.92s: the short
1040.92s: options why is that why would I do that
1043.80s: well it's
1045.20s: because this short option component it
1049.12s: gives me some money up front it gives me
1051.36s: a credit up front so in this case I
1054.60s: would get my $380
1057.52s: $385 times three contracts so it gives
1061.32s: me some money up front but the
1064.40s: downside is you'll notice that it adds
1067.04s: this little Kink to my return profile
1070.12s: and you notice that that's right about
1071.80s: where that short strike is so when I'm
1074.92s: collecting this credit up front it's at
1076.68s: the expense of profitability
1079.44s: so let's use this 140 handle for an
1081.52s: example with these three short options
1084.32s: against the position this trade would
1086.12s: make 1,000 I'm sorry 14,890 if I get rid
1091.60s: of that option and I go back to these
1093.28s: 140s the trade makes
1096.16s: 1,924 so you notice that these slow
1099.20s: things down a bit now they help me if
1103.48s: there's not as big of a move so for
1106.04s: example let's take a look at this 120
1108.80s: area is the 120s I would make about
1113.52s: ,550 with the short option if I get rid
1116.36s: of it and I go to the 120 I make
1121.56s: 1635 if it goes there tomorrow if it
1124.76s: doesn't notice how this purple line
1127.12s: which represents today and this blue
1128.80s: line represents at expiration notice the
1131.68s: difference here each day this purple
1134.16s: line is going to move towards the blue
1136.80s: line so if that move doesn't happen
1139.28s: quick enough I actually would start to
1141.20s: slowly lose money notice the difference
1143.28s: when I add that short option it actually
1146.20s: helps me my break even is improved
1148.44s: pretty significantly because of the
1150.28s: money this brings in so how do I think
1153.20s: about the short options it's very simple
1155.76s: the tradeoff is do I want to collect
1158.72s: more money upfront or do I want to
1162.44s: prioritize Capital Growth those are the
1165.84s: two choices if I want to collect more
1168.08s: money up front
1169.44s: I will sell more of these and I can
1171.76s: collect more money up front notice
1174.40s: though how I have to be careful how many
1176.44s: I sell so if you sell too many you can
1179.40s: actually be too right and lose money
1183.12s: this is what a more standard diagonal
1185.36s: p&l graph will look like where if it
1187.84s: goes too far in your favor you actually
1190.28s: can start losing money I don't want that
1192.60s: and that's part of the reason why you'll
1194.40s: see me use these ratios and some of the
1197.12s: things I'll show you in a little bit
1198.88s: make sure that I have no upside risk in
1201.64s: the trade I do not want to lose money if
1204.52s: I'm too right super super annoying the
1209.04s: way I think about it is in general if
1212.48s: I'm putting on the trade for a long
1215.24s: thesis I want to give the long options
1217.84s: the best chance for Success so that
1220.68s: means I'm typically going to air on the
1222.88s: lighter side of shorts against the Longs
1226.40s: now something I'll do with the shorts is
1228.68s: R them out and up for a credit if
1231.84s: possible if they fall in the money but
1235.40s: if things Mo move too fast you can't
1237.40s: always do that so it's important to
1239.44s: think about that ahead of time so those
1242.00s: are the legs essentially that I look at
1245.64s: so now let's talk about the products
1247.24s: what kind of products do I trade
1249.60s: realistically it's going to require
1251.72s: really liquid underlyings because one of
1254.44s: the things with liquidity is the further
1257.04s: out in time you go the less liquid the
1260.68s: options get you'll notice that the bid
1262.48s: ask spreads get wider and wider the
1264.92s: further out in time you go so I have to
1268.96s: trade things that are liquid in general
1270.76s: for me that's going to be S&P 500 stocks
1273.64s: it's going to be ETFs it's going to be
1276.12s: sector ETFs things that have really
1279.08s: really strong underlying and then also
1282.60s: option liquidity and again you can
1284.00s: reference that video I mentioned earlier
1286.40s: if you have questions on what's liquid
1288.20s: or how find something that's liquid so
1291.60s: that's the first thing the other thing
1292.76s: I'm going to look for are things that
1294.44s: are generally moving up things that are
1297.28s: showing strength and moving in the
1299.88s: direction that I want what I don't want
1301.56s: to do with this strategy is to try to
1304.56s: bottom dip too much because it's really
1307.64s: really difficult to manage that because
1310.08s: you have to have really effective
1312.20s: Capital Management because again
1313.44s: remember when I'm going further out in
1316.32s: time and I'm spending more money on the
1319.92s: option so that I can get a better Delta
1322.60s: I don't want to actually risk all of
1324.72s: that I'm going to try to manage it so
1327.44s: that's why it's so important for me to
1329.16s: have a pretty solid management plan in
1331.12s: place for the capital so the products
1334.40s: really simple typically S&P 500 stocks
1337.20s: things that have
1338.40s: liquid options chains ETFs it's not
1342.28s: limited to that I absolutely will trade
1344.56s: things that don't necessarily have like
1346.40s: weekly option expirations for example
1349.00s: but in general that's what I'm going to
1351.44s: do now let's talk about the management
1354.52s: in the overall goal of the strategy it's
1358.08s: to Trend follow it's to follow something
1360.12s: that's moving up now you'll notice that
1363.08s: there's a portion where we can have
1365.40s: these out ofthe money calls that then
1367.84s: fall in the money if it goes in our
1371.04s: favor so for example going back to this
1374.36s: we have short calls at 134 so if we get
1377.64s: to a point where those short calls are
1379.32s: in the money we now have something that
1380.88s: we at least have to deal with in some
1383.16s: capacity so there's different ways you
1385.32s: can manage those short calls you can
1387.68s: close them down for a loss I do that
1390.32s: sometimes if it's a very small loss not
1392.16s: very
1392.88s: frequently the other choices to roll
1395.24s: them out and up to increase your basis
1399.08s: if possible I do that pretty regularly
1402.24s: or if you're using the short calls as a
1404.84s: way to slowly unwind your trade what I
1408.08s: prefer to do is as I close the short
1411.16s: calls I will sell long calls to cover
1416.12s: the cost of the short calls so what
1419.56s: would that look like let's say that I
1421.72s: sold these calls for
1424.16s: $3.80 and let's say when the underlying
1427.76s: is trading at 140 let's just say that
1429.60s: these are now trading at $5 so I'm
1432.04s: losing
1433.16s: a120 well what I'm going to do is take
1435.32s: that $120 multiply It Out by how many
1437.88s: contracts I I have that tells me what
1439.56s: the overall loss is going to be times
1441.92s: 100 on the trade and then I'm going to
1444.24s: sell enough long calls to cover the cost
1448.60s: of the short calls this is a way for me
1451.08s: to unwind the position as it's doing
1453.12s: what I want and to make sure that I'm
1456.12s: not realizing losses on one part of the
1459.64s: trade and not realizing gains on the
1462.60s: offsetting part of the trade because
1464.72s: what really sucks is if you take those
1467.24s: calls down for a loss because you want
1468.84s: it to go up more because you want to
1470.28s: make more money but then it goes down
1472.80s: now you've made less money on the long
1474.24s: calls you've already realized the loss
1475.76s: on the short calls you're creating a
1477.16s: problem for yourself so the cliffnotes
1479.64s: version of the short call management is
1481.44s: really simple in general I'm just going
1483.16s: to try to roll out and up if I can't
1485.20s: roll out and up then I will sell long
1488.40s: calls to cover the cost of the short
1490.08s: calls pretty much it and we need to talk
1493.28s: about this thing called the Critical
1495.56s: Strike so let's get a better idea of the
1499.08s: total profile of what this thing looks
1501.32s: like this is using another tiger this is
1503.56s: using rut which is actually what the
1505.16s: example is going to be in but this gives
1507.88s: you an idea of how the overall product
1511.32s: behaves we talked about a lot of this
1512.80s: stuff already the main thing here is
1515.48s: just to remember that p&l in the trade
1517.68s: is managed via technical analysis for me
1520.84s: and then I fit positions to it so what
1524.00s: that means in this case is say for
1526.40s: example I'm trading Nvidia I'm I'm not
1528.52s: going to pick an arbitrary loss on my
1530.84s: options to get out of the trade I'm
1532.84s: going to look at the underlying I'm
1534.32s: going to say okay it's starting to
1536.00s: rebound maybe I think it's starting to S
1538.16s: some strength I'm not positive about it
1540.40s: but let's say that I think that there's
1543.28s: support somewhere around this 110 handle
1546.16s: maybe somewhere at 111 is using one of
1549.16s: these volume nodes like right here so
1551.00s: let's say it's like right there I'll get
1552.84s: rid of this one to get rid of the noise
1556.16s: let's say that becomes my floor so that
1558.64s: essentially means that the underlying
1560.64s: right now is at 118 and I have like a
1562.92s: 7po downside in this configuration it'
1565.52s: be really high probability of getting
1567.08s: stopped out here but let's just say that
1569.16s: that's the downside so what I would do
1570.68s: now is say that's where I think
1573.16s: resistance is if it falls below that and
1575.32s: let's say it cracks below 110 giving it
1577.48s: a little bit of extra room to move then
1579.68s: it's time to get out so then what I'm
1581.52s: going to do is go into the analyze tab
1583.76s: or just do the math you can do either
1586.04s: I'm going to see what the p&l would be
1588.76s: at 110 in this case I would be down
1592.80s: 4,256 bucks and I'm going to say how do
1595.60s: I feel about that how does that fit
1597.40s: within the portfolio is that too much
1598.92s: too little do I have enough Capital At
1600.84s: Risk to make this trade make sense well
1603.04s: I also need to understand another part
1604.36s: of this equation where do I think it's
1605.64s: going to go where's the upside here it
1608.28s: looks like the first stop is somewhere
1610.76s: in here like maybe the 122 handle so
1614.16s: then I get to say what do I make if it
1616.36s: hits 122 we go to the anal Iz tab we run
1619.64s: over here to
1621.44s: 122 and we would make 3,000 bucks is so
1626.88s: what's the probability of me hitting 122
1630.12s: versus 110 again you can either do the
1632.48s: math or you can use the options chain to
1634.24s: solve this or you can use something like
1635.80s: this and I could say okay well maybe
1638.40s: over the next 30 days I'm curious what's
1640.84s: the probability of me hitting 1 11 in
1643.32s: that case it's 81% almost essentially
1646.00s: going to happen what's the probability
1648.24s: of me hitting 122 in this case it's 83%
1651.28s: point5 even better than the downside so
1654.04s: you can see what the expected return is
1656.16s: based on your near-term and then
1659.24s: Target projections whatever those are so
1662.04s: you can have a near-term Target like
1663.60s: this this looks like where the first
1664.76s: stop might be and then if it gets
1666.40s: through there it looks like the second
1668.00s: stop might be somewhere up here like 128
1670.60s: and you can see based on the
1671.76s: probabilistic assessment you have on
1673.32s: those directions what size makes sense
1675.76s: for your portfolio this is how I size
1677.72s: the trade
1679.40s: so that's the idea of managing the p&l
1683.12s: Via ta then making sure that the size
1686.16s: Mak sense for the risk that I have on so
1688.16s: let's talk about this idea of Critical
1689.52s: Strike this is an example of kind of a
1692.48s: trade log that I built for these this is
1694.00s: available for all the outlier Pro
1695.44s: members that are interested in it and
1697.28s: for those that um aren't in there that's
1699.72s: okay you can kind of build your own by
1701.44s: modeling off of what you see here so
1704.56s: what I'll do is I'll figure out how much
1706.24s: money I want to give a trade all that
1707.92s: kind Jazz then there's a couple things
1710.56s: on here I really want to draw your
1711.84s: attention to though this first one here
1713.96s: is this idea of a Critical Strike what
1715.64s: is a Critical Strike well it
1718.44s: ensures that where we sell our short
1721.44s: option is not potentially locking in a
1724.00s: loss so it in the beginning is very easy
1728.56s: when you first buy your long options in
1732.76s: this case as long as you sell short
1735.24s: options that are essentially out of the
1737.08s: money when you in here then it'll you'll
1740.80s: be okay to the upside depending on what
1742.92s: ratio you pick which we'll talk next but
1745.08s: it's not locking and a loss where it
1747.12s: starts getting confusing is if Nvidia
1750.32s: goes down a little bit so let's say
1752.48s: instead of it being at 118 it drops down
1754.48s: here to 113 you're still on the trade
1756.44s: but it's going down well you have to be
1758.92s: a little more careful with what strike
1761.88s: price you pick otherwise you essentially
1765.08s: commit the equivalent of going into here
1770.52s: let me show you you commit the
1772.64s: equivalent of selling short calls below
1776.48s: your long option basis get this up here
1779.48s: so you can see it so in this example the
1782.00s: long option basis is
1784.88s: 1729 so what you don't want is then to
1788.20s: sell short calls below that basis so the
1791.64s: whole point of the Critical Strike is it
1793.32s: makes sure that whatever strike you're
1796.04s: selecting keeps you from doing that now
1799.32s: there's an easy way to do this as well
1801.20s: again if you have a platform like
1802.72s: thinker swim it'll do it for you so for
1805.08s: example let's say Nvidia moves around
1807.60s: and let's say that we're not looking at
1808.76s: these 134s anymore and you're like okay
1810.40s: where can I sell these short calls and
1812.64s: you're like well I want to be really
1813.80s: aggressive for whatever reason let's say
1815.16s: you wanted to sell these 115s you might
1817.24s: look you say like okay can I sell these
1818.68s: 115s well if you look at 115 that strike
1823.48s: on the p&l graph well that gives you
1826.76s: that's a problem because it locks in a
1829.24s: loss those short calls produce a loss
1832.64s: unless you do something about them so
1835.16s: your platform can help you with that or
1837.12s: again something like this can so what I
1839.16s: do is I take the long option basis
1842.20s: whatever the whatever I got in it at I
1846.16s: take out the long option value whatever
1848.36s: it's currently trading at divide that by
1850.24s: the long option Delta as it sits right
1852.36s: now and I add the current stock price so
1855.76s: in the example that I gave for the rut
1858.48s: this tells me that regardless of where
1860.60s: the rut trading at that point in time
1863.60s: that I essentially need to be above this
1865.40s: number in order to not have upside risk
1869.44s: on the short options that's all so this
1871.52s: tells me what strike I can sell the
1873.96s: short call at and not have upside risk
1876.20s: not lock in a loss at where I'm at
1878.24s: there's two other things in here that
1879.48s: matter to me the number of short call
1882.40s: Lots is a really simple formula here so
1885.56s: I take the number of long options I have
1887.36s: times the long long option Delta so
1889.56s: literally all that's doing is cumulating
1891.44s: my total deltas and again your platform
1893.32s: will do that for you so if I take a look
1895.56s: down here this right here it's you see
1898.48s: this
1899.64s: 7292 it tells you your total Deltas so
1903.52s: in this case we want to make sure that
1906.32s: we never have a scenario that our short
1909.48s: call Deltas overwhelm our long call
1912.56s: Delta so what that looks like here is if
1914.04s: I click this and let's say that instead
1916.00s: of selling four I want to sell a bunch
1917.56s: more well if I sell five then I have 146
1922.16s: Deltas if I sell six now I have 176
1926.36s: Deltas so you see how this number
1928.56s: changes because the other thing you have
1930.04s: to remember again with these short
1933.08s: options is if I sell
1936.48s: them and then the underlying starts
1939.16s: rallying against me remember there's
1942.76s: gamma so if it moves against me a dollar
1946.64s: then I lose 20 9 but I also gain one
1952.12s: Delta so now it's going to be 30 then if
1954.84s: it moves against me another dollar now
1956.60s: I'm going to gain two Deltas so on and
1959.88s: so forth that's what leads the
1961.88s: compounding that can cause you problems
1964.96s: so for example if this ratio becomes too
1968.16s: high what that tells you is that after a
1971.48s: big enough move against your long
1973.04s: options your short option Deltas
1976.64s: overwhelm your long option Deltas
1980.24s: because the other thing to remember is
1982.32s: as these are going against you your long
1985.40s: options are going to cap out sooner or
1987.84s: later right because they can only go to
1989.68s: a one Delta so they're starting at a 71
1993.16s: Delta and I have a little bit of Delta
1995.44s: that I can gain but once they get to a
1997.68s: one Delta per lot that's all they can be
1999.96s: at so the whole idea behind the short
2003.76s: call Lots is just to make sure that
2005.40s: you're not selling too many so that
2008.16s: you're not creating upside risk and
2010.56s: again your platform can also tell you
2012.32s: this and then the last thing here is the
2014.92s: adjusted long call basis this helps me
2018.28s: calculate what the current basis is if
2021.28s: I'm accounting for in the- money short
2024.12s: options so that I make sure as I'm
2028.12s: trading around the position I fully
2031.04s: understand what the actual basis is for
2034.28s: the long calls as I'm selling them to
2037.92s: cover the short calls that's all and it
2040.80s: feeds into the rest of these numbers
2044.16s: slightly depending on what you're trying
2046.28s: to track but the adjusted long call
2048.32s: basis it lets me
2050.72s: know capturing this cost of closing in
2054.96s: the money short options and I'm using
2058.48s: these long options to cover the cost it
2061.32s: gives me the adjusted basis accounting
2063.00s: for all of that and again your platform
2065.04s: can do this for you all right let's take
2067.12s: a quick look at an example pretty simple
2069.64s: one actually so on the 11th of July the
2074.60s: Russell started to break up and out I
2076.36s: was waiting for this for a while so in
2078.28s: this case I went in and I bought 10 of
2080.76s: the 20 September 2050 calls for 2080 so
2085.56s: again you can figure out the DTE from
2087.48s: here this was a shorter duration ratio
2090.64s: called diagonal because I expected the
2092.28s: move to be pretty heavy but I wanted to
2094.32s: give enough time to work around but not
2096.00s: a ton and these were over a 70 Delta so
2099.60s: then notice that there's no short call
2101.76s: yet it's because I was expecting this to
2104.52s: be a pretty strong up move and my goal
2107.40s: was to add the short calls when things
2109.80s: slowed
2111.32s: down right here so from the 11th of July
2115.00s: I did nothing I bought these and did
2116.60s: nothing then on the 17th of July I
2119.80s: decided to sell to open five of this 16
2123.72s: August so about a month DTE 2350 call so
2128.32s: these are pretty far out of the money
2130.04s: these were around a 30 Delta at the time
2132.36s: for
2133.48s: 2710 so notice what I did here I bought
2137.04s: when it was breaking out and then I
2139.52s: waited until it started to slow down and
2142.52s: that's when I chose to sell the short
2144.48s: calls again remember the short calls are
2146.92s: secondary to the long calls so you don't
2150.12s: have to automatically put them on at the
2152.04s: same time there's no forcing function
2154.72s: there for you so I took in 13,550 from
2159.20s: that trade then it was time to hang out
2160.84s: for a little bit then the Russell
2163.44s: started to play games with my heart and
2165.88s: it started to come down so I was just
2169.08s: like oh interesting need to adjust here
2173.32s: so what I did was and it's because we
2175.52s: started falling down below this support
2178.56s: level you can see that I draw them as
2182.12s: the product moves so that I'm
2184.28s: calculating where I'm watching things so
2188.16s: I saw it flirting below that level and I
2190.16s: wanted to see if we would get a close
2191.84s: and then we actually got an open and a
2193.36s: close below it so on the 19th I sold to
2197.00s: close five of these 20 September 2050
2200.52s: calls for $179 that gave me
2203.40s: $29,100 in profit on those options so
2207.20s: it's essentially taking the move from
2208.64s: here to here on the long calls and
2211.20s: notice I only took down half then I
2214.44s: decided to take two of the 16 a 2350s
2218.40s: down for 1040 this gave me a profit of
2221.88s: 3350 why did I take down two if I had
2224.52s: five it's because I want to keep the
2226.88s: ratio intact remember that ratio I
2230.20s: talked to you about I don't want to cap
2232.28s: my upside I never want short calls to
2234.48s: equal long calls so in this case I took
2237.48s: five of my 10 down that gave me five
2239.72s: long calls left I don't want five short
2242.28s: calls against five long calls I want my
2244.80s: upside so I take some of these down
2248.04s: so this gave me a realized p&l at this
2250.08s: point of
2251.72s: 32,4 then on 22 July it started to move
2255.72s: back up so it looked like a little bit
2258.12s: of a head fake I decided to start
2259.72s: scaling back into the trade so in this
2262.04s: case I bought to open three more of the
2264.28s: 20 2050 calls for
2266.44s: 18035 I picked the same straight cuz
2268.44s: it's a little easier don't have to do it
2269.96s: it's kind of my preference and in this
2273.16s: case that took my total debit on this
2274.84s: trade to 54,1
2277.96s: and we're now just cruising along now
2281.16s: one important note as I'm figuring out
2283.20s: the sizes for these trades like any
2285.24s: standard trade the initial step always
2288.40s: includes the initial allocation and then
2290.60s: the scaling as I mentioned I wanted to
2293.16s: start with about the max size I was
2295.16s: going to give this trade so in this case
2297.08s: you'll notice that's why I started with
2298.48s: 10 and in this case I only added three
2300.52s: because they're more expensive now I'm
2302.48s: being very careful to stay within my
2305.36s: initial allocation and scaling rules
2308.08s: so then the unwind on the 1st of August
2310.92s: we had this big giant red down day so
2314.68s: the next trade was selling five of the
2318.60s: 20 step 2050 calls for
2320.72s: 280 so that was earlier in the day when
2323.20s: we were up here just as we broke below
2326.24s: this support so that netted 40,000 bucks
2330.80s: and I closed out the remaining three
2332.88s: calls at that point again going back I
2335.16s: do not want to have three long calls and
2338.68s: three short calls so I just took the
2340.08s: three calls down because I kind of had a
2342.16s: suspicion I was going to be getting out
2343.44s: of this trade based on the velocity but
2346.08s: at this point I took a pause and that's
2348.68s: where you see this p&l here was up until
2352.24s: this point all this stuff then we fell
2356.36s: below the next support level I had which
2360.28s: was right here so as soon as we fell
2362.88s: below that there I closed the rest of
2365.56s: the position so I closed the three that
2368.64s: I bought here closed them down here and
2371.04s: I bought them for 18035 and I sold them
2374.60s: for 17530 so I took a loss of 15515 so
2378.52s: on the total trade it takes me to a
2380.32s: profit of 76k 63% return on invested
2383.20s: Capital this is one of those instances
2386.04s: where as you could tell it's not like
2387.64s: this crazy big 3,000% return on the
2390.04s: money but it's a solid overall gross
2393.20s: return and a lot of this is fueled by
2395.48s: the initial outlays that I gave which
2397.68s: were a little more expensive right
2399.36s: $121,000 to put the trade on but it's
2402.80s: still a solid return on the position
2404.36s: it's just a slightly different style of
2405.72s: trading than trying to compound
2407.12s: massively so this is just another recent
2410.24s: example of the ratio called diagonals
2412.04s: there's an entire play list on these
2414.40s: I'll link to in the notes below for you
2417.04s: but as always if there's any questions
2418.76s: let me know be an outlier see you guys
2420.72s: later
