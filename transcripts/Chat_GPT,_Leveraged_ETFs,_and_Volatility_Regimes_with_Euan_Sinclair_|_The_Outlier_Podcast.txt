0.00s: what's up everybody Eric here back with
2.28s: you in and we have a bunch of stuff to
5.46s: talk about it's been a few weeks since
8.76s: we've talked last so I'm interested to
11.76s: learn a few things from you the first
13.56s: thing is you just wrapped up a course
15.78s: we've talked about that a little bit
17.10s: before we started recording but
19.38s: um how'd it go
21.06s: well obviously it's not really up to me
22.80s: to say how it went but the feedback
24.42s: we've got from the participants is
26.04s: really good people really liked it
28.74s: um the slack Community is growing it's
30.48s: pretty active uh people are now sort of
33.48s: this cross-pollination of ideas people
35.46s: are like working on stuff and we've
37.80s: managed to keep it to uh
40.38s: very sort of evidence-based very very
43.68s: much like I don't want to hear your
45.06s: [ __ ] opinion on Tesla whether it's
46.68s: going up with Elon Musk is genius you
49.20s: know I want you to like
50.64s: on Thursday Tesla calls are underpriced
53.22s: right find the data go and tell me is
55.14s: that true that kind of thing so it's
56.94s: working well in that regard
59.10s: um it was heavily oversubscribed we'll
61.44s: probably do it again
63.60s: maybe August
65.88s: um we limited it this time a little bit
67.86s: because we didn't know whether we could
69.72s: keep up with the questions
71.28s: and it kind of depends on
73.86s: you've got to get a workflow going but
76.32s: that went pretty well so I think if we
77.88s: did it again we'd probably just have an
79.26s: open enrollment thing so that's awesome
81.90s: yeah I'm glad to hear one of the things
83.88s: I remember when we were first talking
85.50s: about it and had a chance to look over
86.76s: some of the materials is like
88.74s: I think you do such a good job balancing
91.32s: the
92.70s: higher theoretical slash math heavy
95.52s: aspects with the practical application
98.28s: because I think that's like one of the
99.54s: biggest niches quote unquote that's kind
102.30s: of missing when you talk about options
104.16s: is things tend to be either super
105.72s: theoretical or just some dude that
108.18s: doesn't really understand put call
109.50s: parody but it's just slinging options
111.42s: and you know there doesn't seem like a
113.94s: lot of educated Middle Ground how did
116.10s: you guys go about finding that balance
118.62s: between including enough Theory but not
120.72s: overwhelming Theory but including enough
122.64s: practical application but not just
124.62s: focusing only on that
126.78s: yeah well I think in general that's
128.82s: where you've got to be as a Trader right
130.74s: I mean there's options in our
134.06s: irreducibly mathematically complex and
136.50s: there's no point pretending they're not
138.90s: so on one hand you've got the you know
142.20s: the the Chad who thinks it is age
144.36s: everywhere and all he got to do is fire
145.86s: out thousands of orders and he is going
147.42s: to make so much money and he's worrying
149.34s: about what kind of Ferrari he's going to
151.20s: get at the end of the year you know and
153.30s: that's although I also you know but and
156.60s: then you've got the professor at the
158.16s: other end who's like only sees the math
160.92s: and he thinks there's an edge in the
162.66s: math and neither of these people's right
164.94s: there's there's no edge in math there's
166.86s: no Edge in knowing about options but if
169.32s: you don't know about options and you're
170.94s: trading them you're going to blow up
173.46s: absolutely like they are
176.04s: complicated and they will get away from
179.28s: you very quickly
180.90s: so there is definitely stuff you need to
183.78s: know but there's a lot of other stuff
186.06s: that you get taught in college courses
187.68s: that you don't need to know
189.44s: like you don't need to know stochastic
192.06s: calculus and I don't think you ever
193.74s: needed to you know no one none of the
196.70s: researchers using that now anyway
198.60s: because all the stuff that could be
199.86s: solved that way is being sold so I think
202.38s: you've got a lot of math professors
203.94s: teaching the course
205.38s: you know basically from 25 years ago and
208.50s: that's no real use to anyone
210.66s: um so that's what James and I are trying
212.58s: to do is find that middle ground
214.44s: and I think
215.94s: that's what I tried to do in my books as
217.98s: well obviously the books are written at
219.90s: a
220.62s: more
222.60s: probably in a more mathematically high
224.34s: level but they're not mathematics books
226.98s: and I never
229.14s: I was never setting out to impress
230.64s: people with mathematics that's not the
232.38s: point but you should be able to read
234.24s: them and just read through the equation
236.22s: and just trust me on what's going on
238.08s: there if you need to because it's the
240.36s: phenomena that's the important thing and
243.84s: this is one of the reasons I wanted to
245.04s: do it with James is because he's very
246.66s: much on the same page as me with that
248.24s: he's got much more of a Delta one
251.34s: background than I do and
255.06s: be honest trading Delta one is much more
257.94s: of a
259.74s: it's more heavy on the trading side
261.42s: because it's less heavy on the theory
262.98s: side so it's normally the way it works
265.14s: as things get theoretically more
266.58s: complicated they trade in a more and
268.20s: more simple manner one of the other
269.88s: things that I I was actually rereading
273.30s: through positional options trading and
275.04s: actually working through those
276.54s: differential equations the way that you
278.34s: are so I'm curious if it's to help
280.08s: people understand the way that options
282.30s: are behaving in a real world or is it to
285.84s: give the theoretical background to them
289.08s: uh I mean it could be either but
292.80s: the way my brain works normally with
295.14s: these things is say I've got a problem I
297.48s: want to figure out I don't know
300.12s: some sizing problem like if you're doing
302.64s: a certain trade what's the best way to
304.08s: size it right so once you've got that
307.26s: idea you have to then convert it into a
309.66s: mathematical model
310.98s: so you can work through the
312.66s: implementation the implications of that
315.30s: model so that's sort of the way I would
317.46s: do it with say the option pricing stuff
319.80s: as well like the directional
321.66s: option pricing stuff you're like well
323.58s: okay what does it mean that there's a
325.80s: return in the underlying where does that
327.66s: flow through to the equations you work
329.88s: through that and you see where it ends
331.44s: at the other end so it's like you start
333.42s: with your assumption and you work
334.68s: through the mathematics to see where it
336.18s: takes you
337.14s: so does that make sense it does yeah
339.42s: absolutely it's basically the way a
341.22s: physicist would approach the world
343.02s: it's like you make an observation then
345.42s: you try and model that observation and
347.40s: see what the model leads you to
349.76s: hopefully it's something new you want to
352.98s: get something new out of the model that
354.78s: wasn't just in the observation you made
356.58s: got it yeah and I think that that's
359.82s: that's one of the cool things about when
361.50s: I was reading a lot of your work even
362.82s: your older work
364.32s: is that it got me to think a lot more
367.38s: along those lines uh people that took
369.48s: your course
370.80s: what did you give them like specific
373.14s: next steps on like okay this is what we
375.66s: showed you guys this is what we think
377.94s: you should be focusing on next like what
380.28s: how do you see their progression
382.44s: I mean to be honest we called the course
386.16s: quote for retail because the idea was we
389.28s: were going to get a whole bunch of sort
390.36s: of retail Traders or you know people who
393.24s: weren't options Traders like we had rias
395.28s: and money managers and so forth
397.44s: we were going to teach them quantitative
399.72s: methods that worked what it turned out
402.60s: to be more though is retail trading for
405.24s: quants because a lot of the people we
407.58s: had we a lot of people had very heavy
409.92s: math backgrounds like we had math
411.72s: professors we had Engineers computer
413.94s: scientists
415.50s: their problem
417.72s: is much more there on the academic side
420.12s: of things and they want certainty before
422.52s: they do a trade so
425.10s: we thought we were going to be taking
427.02s: the you know no offense but the YouTube
429.42s: was and telling them slow down do some
432.30s: work first make sure you understand it
434.22s: then do a trade whereas what we ended up
436.80s: telling these people is like just don't
438.96s: be a [ __ ] do a damn trade put something
441.48s: on yeah you're going to learn a lot more
443.76s: when you've got to trade on than you are
446.34s: by thinking about it before you put the
448.44s: trade on and a lot of these people
451.20s: they would say something like
454.20s: uh sell options you know on Friday night
457.92s: and I'd be like what's the best time to
459.60s: sell them I'm like I don't know Friday
461.10s: night and like five minutes before the
463.68s: close or ten minutes before the close
465.18s: and I'm like literally I don't know if I
466.92s: want to go early I'll do it 10 minutes
468.54s: before the close if I'm sitting at my
470.52s: desk I'll do it right on the clothes it
472.32s: doesn't matter and it's like that's not
474.54s: the important thing two or three minutes
476.40s: here and there doesn't matter and
478.38s: they're like well could we find an
479.58s: optimal and I'm like look you're going
481.44s: about this the wrong way
483.24s: you're going to waste time looking for
485.46s: an Optimum
486.96s: an optimal solution to something that
489.36s: doesn't exist you'll find something but
492.30s: it's meaningless the only thing we know
494.04s: is we've got this broad effect and the
497.04s: best you can do is throw [ __ ] at this
499.38s: broad effect and hope over time it wins
502.98s: all these other little minuscule things
505.64s: really aren't the problem so you'll
509.04s: learn a lot more you can always make
510.42s: things better
511.58s: but you've got to start doing the basic
514.68s: stuff before you really know what it is
516.66s: you have to improve because before you
518.52s: do a trade honestly you don't know what
521.28s: the the weaknesses of your process are
524.40s: right is it your execution is it your
527.58s: transaction costs is it the fact you're
530.10s: doing it on the wrong index I I don't
533.34s: know you know you have to do the trade
535.80s: to figure that out
537.54s: so that was really where we were
539.64s: bullying these guys to do and they'll be
541.56s: like
542.64s: you know have you tested this effect
544.62s: like we give them an effect right very
546.90s: standard one bonds go up
549.30s: in the last week before the end of the
552.06s: month right absolutely they do right so
555.00s: we're like go and buy some Futures buy
556.56s: some TLT and they're like can I sell
558.48s: some pot Springs
559.68s: and I'm like look you can do whatever
561.18s: you like but why why why are you doing
564.72s: this when the simplest thing we've told
567.66s: you it goes up what's the simplest way
569.82s: to make money from that buy it okay
572.88s: don't dick around and make it more
574.92s: complicated
576.00s: the idea is to make things simpler not
578.46s: more complicated
580.02s: so you always want to trade the simplest
583.10s: cheapest instrument
585.24s: and that's never options so if you need
588.66s: to trade options in trade options but if
591.24s: you don't
592.56s: that's great that's a good thing it's
594.66s: not a bad thing
596.58s: so that was sort of what we're hammering
598.38s: we're still hammering at them about that
601.20s: I I like that it reminds me of a saying
604.20s: that I I tell a lot of people's you know
605.94s: Perfection is the enemy of progress
607.80s: right like the idea is do something that
611.34s: you think is relatively well thought out
613.02s: and then optimize it over time but yeah
615.66s: if you try to find that that Perfection
617.22s: but and it also seems to really affect
619.02s: like you're talking about that crowd of
620.52s: people the people that are really smart
621.96s: super analytical that they get stuck in
624.60s: this Loop that they can't escape from So
627.32s: speaking specifically to that audience
630.12s: it's uh tell me
633.18s: see I was briefly an academic and
637.08s: when you say Perfections the enemy of
639.60s: like progress in the academic world you
643.44s: you can't be perfect
645.54s: but if you don't try to be you won't be
647.64s: good enough it's such a
650.94s: the best analogy is like professional
652.98s: sports it's such a competitive place
656.82s: that you have to do everything to be as
659.82s: good as you can so that's the game that
661.98s: these people are coming from and it's
664.68s: just that they're trying to apply that
666.72s: game into a situation where it really
668.58s: doesn't fit
669.72s: so what they're doing is understandable
672.02s: and I was like that as well like I
674.64s: definitely that was my problem I had to
677.04s: overcome it's like I
679.50s: I would wait for a trade to be perfect
683.28s: and by the time as a market maker by the
685.50s: time the perfect trade turned up 50
687.30s: other people already done it you know
689.34s: because they're they're prepared to do
691.02s: it when it's pretty good not perfect so
694.20s: I know the thing they're struggling with
697.56s: and you know it's very common for people
699.96s: to be like you know these academics
701.52s: they'll never be good Traders blah blah
703.32s: blah but you know the the YouTube
705.00s: chatter probably won't be either
706.70s: everyone's got a separate group of
709.38s: problems they've got to get through it's
711.24s: hard for everyone so whether you're
713.40s: starting at this end or at this end it's
715.80s: going to be difficult
717.30s: but in order to be good you've all got
719.22s: to end up in the same place you know
721.62s: just
722.52s: throwing trades out there isn't yeah
725.10s: well done you're not under trading but
727.38s: you've got other problems
729.42s: right yeah and that makes total sense I
731.46s: think the thing that I'm kind of
733.68s: referring to is when before somebody is
736.08s: willing to try something they want it to
738.30s: be perfect or they want to have a
740.94s: well-formed essentially as good as they
743.76s: can possibly get it structure and I
746.22s: think that they're again they're to your
747.54s: point that there's value in that but
750.36s: I've always seen that same Force though
753.00s: where the people that kind of trade long
755.40s: term they find this balance of both and
758.04s: I definitely think that it's awesome
760.08s: that you guys talk so much about it and
761.58s: I also think it's really cool that you
763.56s: can like continue to remind people it's
765.48s: actually re-entered my conversation
768.36s: cycle of creating the simplest product
772.08s: because one of the things that you'll
774.48s: I'm sure you've heard right people are
776.10s: options Traders or Futures Traders and
779.46s: sometimes they might be but it seems
781.92s: like from the retail perspective that
783.48s: might be limiting so for that audience
786.06s: though that spends so much time trading
789.00s: you know specific products
791.22s: what would you say to get them to be
793.92s: more open to trading a simpler product
796.34s: I.E maybe they think something's going
798.84s: to go up to go to Delta one versus
801.68s: buying out of the money calls or buying
804.06s: in the money calls that are far out in
805.44s: time like how would you get them to
807.72s: think about those two different value
808.86s: propositions
811.62s: well I think part of the reason that
813.42s: people end up in the options world is a
815.70s: very sensible one it's because
816.96s: volatility is more predictable than
819.42s: Direction but most of the time you can't
823.68s: predict the direction of a stock you
826.20s: just can't right especially on the daily
828.24s: level like it's the most difficult
830.28s: problem in the world like everyone's
832.38s: trying to do it
834.12s: it's not going to happen 99 of the time
837.18s: so you go into the options world for a
839.34s: very good reason but then you get really
841.26s: hyper focused on that and you find a
843.72s: situation where there isn't it doesn't
845.70s: apply and your mind is just stuck in
849.66s: this other world so I I think the thing
852.90s: to do is just to be and this applies to
854.76s: all trades all the time be very clear on
857.10s: what your Edge actually is
859.32s: like
860.52s: you know ask yourself like what am I
863.22s: trying to do in this trade what is the
865.02s: phenomenon I'm trying to monetize so
867.48s: it's yet bonds go up
869.22s: okay what's the simplest way to do that
872.16s: it's not to buy a call spread it's not
874.20s: to buy a one-year leap it's not it's to
877.14s: buy bonds and I think
879.90s: you you have to
882.36s: a lot of this is just about being very
884.64s: very clear about what your actual Edge
886.98s: in any case is you know so
891.48s: often it yeah I don't yeah that's it
895.62s: that's the answer
896.82s: period yeah but I I think that that's
899.52s: it's a great way to to frame it to get
901.80s: traders to Simply ask themselves what's
903.84s: the edge and then finding the clearest
905.94s: way to express it because one of the
907.08s: things that I picked up from one of your
908.94s: books and I think it's a great way to
910.92s: frame it is you know as soon as you
912.54s: start trading options
914.04s: you're introducing a lot of other forces
916.44s: that might not even be part of your
918.30s: hypothesis I.E bonds go up okay well as
921.78s: soon as you're buying options now you're
923.28s: introducing volatility time to get like
925.20s: all these other things so I think it's a
927.72s: really great way to think about it and
928.98s: speaking about volatility one of
932.16s: um the members from my community is was
935.04s: asking about well first they were asking
937.26s: about volatility regimes but then we
938.82s: bracketed it down really what they were
940.38s: asking about is volatility surface
943.20s: regimes and they're curious how you
948.18s: determine what kind of regime that we're
950.70s: in at a given point in time like how do
952.68s: you
953.76s: um how do you essentially analyze a
956.40s: volatility surface regime
960.30s: I don't really know what they mean by
963.30s: regime yeah you mean
967.38s: if it's in terms of parameterizing the
970.56s: slope
972.06s: um or the term structure
975.24s: I mean there are ways of doing that but
978.30s: I'm not really sure
980.64s: the thing I think most people
983.22s: get a little bit
985.26s: wrong is that the volatility surface 95
989.28s: of the time just
991.50s: is kind of constant right I mean the
994.20s: level of vol changes and the term
996.18s: structure does flip up and down right
998.64s: um but the actual shape of the curve
1001.22s: doesn't change nearly as much as people
1003.68s: kind of hope it does
1006.56s: um so I I'm not really clear on exactly
1009.98s: what they want yeah so what they were
1012.44s: referring to was
1014.54s: um Colin Bennett's book trading
1016.10s: volatility there's a section in there
1017.78s: that talks about idealized volatility
1020.54s: regimes so things like sticky Delta
1023.06s: sticky strikes sticky local Vault and
1025.04s: jumpy ball essentially but it's it's
1027.44s: talking about them in relation to the
1029.24s: Vol surface
1031.70s: the thing about all of those things is
1034.16s: they're all idealized states that the
1037.82s: world is never sticky strike it's never
1040.28s: sticky
1041.48s: you know whatever sticky what is the
1044.12s: other one sticky Strokes sticky I
1046.10s: thought I can't remember what they are
1047.30s: kind of tells you something right the
1049.76s: world is never exactly one of those
1051.38s: things the world is always doing all of
1053.54s: those things and
1056.30s: I I think it's more of a
1059.30s: I don't know an educational conceptual
1061.28s: tool than actually one that you'd really
1064.46s: hang your hat on too much
1066.92s: um I mean I really don't think about
1069.50s: that stuff at all so
1072.50s: yeah yeah I think it makes sense to me
1075.02s: once you how much
1076.58s: how important it really is right yeah no
1079.76s: it and that makes total sense to me I
1081.38s: think you know there could be
1083.12s: opportunities to trade it potentially
1084.98s: but when they first brought up Vol
1086.42s: regime's I immediately interpreted it as
1089.48s: is volatility in aggregate high low or
1093.20s: transient that's what I originally
1095.12s: thought and then they kind of sent me
1096.56s: the clip and I realized that they were
1097.88s: actually talking about false surface
1099.14s: regimes and I had a similar kind of
1101.60s: because the follow-on question to that
1104.18s: which is what I'm genuinely curious
1106.04s: about is how would you trade that
1109.04s: okay so if
1110.84s: some of these
1112.96s: vol regimes
1116.12s: if the market is really behaving like
1118.88s: that some of them are arbitrageable
1121.22s: right like they're and I can't remember
1123.44s: one of my books talks about it a bit
1126.20s: um the problem is they're never
1127.76s: perfectly in that regime so
1131.72s: it's not like an ARB and that you're
1133.58s: buying something and immediately selling
1135.14s: something else it's kind of like an
1136.88s: Arbitrage process it'll be like if you
1138.80s: find something that moves in a sine wave
1140.54s: I mean that's arbitrageable because you
1142.58s: sell it there and you buy it there and
1143.90s: you
1144.56s: so it's dynamically arbitrageable sure
1148.22s: but you so you can do it and
1153.26s: so when I said I don't use it I
1155.42s: definitely shade my Deltas that way so
1159.80s: I don't use Black Shoals Delta for
1161.78s: hedging anything I use a total Delta
1164.36s: which also includes the the effect of
1167.74s: volatility change as the underlying
1170.54s: changes
1171.50s: so you use a total derivative instead of
1174.08s: a partial derivative
1176.24s: um so you do have to make some
1177.74s: assumptions there about how volatility
1179.60s: is moving
1181.58s: um so I do use it a little bit but
1183.92s: basically I'm just using an empirical
1186.14s: Marvel I'm saying volatility is doing
1188.84s: this so the at the money volatility does
1191.00s: this as the market moves and it's
1194.60s: typically neither sticky Vol or sticky
1197.18s: strike it's somewhere in the middle of
1198.68s: those two
1200.36s: um so it's
1202.34s: yeah you do use
1205.40s: I use basically an empirical version of
1207.50s: it which essentially is just looking at
1209.72s: how that relationship has moved over the
1212.84s: last well I think I tend to use like
1214.94s: three to six months
1217.34s: got it yeah because I because I actually
1220.34s: remember reading that book a while ago
1222.14s: and when I when I took a look at it I
1224.66s: started tracking it a little bit and I
1226.70s: noticed that most of the time it was
1228.20s: like that sticky local ball
1230.90s: um and the other three scenarios are far
1233.96s: less common at least based on what I was
1235.58s: observing but it's interesting that you
1237.68s: bring up like that total Delta concept
1239.60s: can you explain that a bit more
1242.42s: um okay so this might be difficult to do
1244.64s: without like a whiteboard or something
1248.00s: um
1248.72s: Black Shoals Delta is the derivative of
1252.50s: the option price with respect to the
1254.78s: underlying assuming nothing else is
1257.00s: changing so it's a partial derivative
1259.70s: in reality things other things are
1262.46s: changing in particular the volatility is
1266.60s: changing so as well as default as well
1269.42s: as the option DS you have to have the
1273.26s: option Devol times devole DS
1276.92s: so you need to basically know your Vega
1280.04s: times how much the volatility of that
1282.98s: option is changing as the spot's
1285.02s: changing I see so it's like if you've
1287.60s: got puts and you go down you can expect
1290.48s: the volatility of that put to go up
1294.08s: right well again depending on what Vol
1297.08s: regime you're in if the curve slides
1299.66s: like that it's going to do one thing if
1301.58s: the curve doesn't slide and the put's
1303.32s: going to move it's going to do another
1304.34s: thing
1305.20s: Emmanuel durman wrote a paper on this a
1307.88s: long time ago
1309.92s: um
1310.70s: but yeah like every every Market maker
1312.86s: will use a total Delta like that because
1315.32s: if you don't you really are going to be
1317.78s: mished
1319.58s: um
1320.54s: but
1322.28s: it also matters more to market makers
1325.70s: because they want to stay on the market
1327.98s: their Delta hedge is really going to
1330.62s: immunize them
1332.42s: from what the market is doing so it's
1335.30s: really important that they're matching
1336.86s: what the Market's actually doing so
1339.26s: they're not going to just use one of
1340.70s: these simple regime models they're going
1342.68s: to be using an empirical model as well
1345.38s: otherwise it's not otherwise it's not
1347.18s: going to match
1348.38s: so then for like a typical retail Trader
1351.08s: what do you see the efficacy of a total
1354.08s: Delta tracking for them as worthwhile
1356.66s: not worthwhile
1357.45s: [Music]
1360.20s: I think it's probably not even worth
1363.26s: dealing with it's one of those things
1365.66s: that to do it is going to be a lot of
1368.66s: work like you'd have to come up with
1371.00s: your actual empirical model of how does
1373.76s: the Vol of this particular strike move
1375.92s: as the underlying moves and it's going
1378.50s: to be different for all the strikes like
1379.88s: the app the money is the most important
1381.26s: one but you'll also have changes in the
1383.54s: wings and changes in the risk reversals
1385.64s: and
1386.48s: it's a lot of a lot of work to track all
1389.30s: that stuff and then I'm not sure how
1391.76s: you're going to make any money out of it
1393.20s: because
1395.06s: I wouldn't recommend most retail Traders
1397.82s: do Delta hedging anyway so whether you
1401.18s: think something if you just bring up
1403.34s: your IB screen and it says this is the
1405.74s: 25 Delta put
1407.54s: and your model says no it's actually got
1410.48s: a 28 Delta
1412.40s: I mean who gives a [ __ ] it's like
1415.40s: for you in order as a retail Trader
1418.04s: there's no difference practically
1419.36s: between 25 and 28. it's like
1422.54s: it's going to be lost and
1426.92s: you think you've made a difference but
1428.72s: really once you take into account all
1430.70s: the uncertainty and the modeling to get
1432.68s: to that 28 over 25 I mean who knows you
1435.98s: could just be completely wrong
1437.90s: so
1439.22s: I can't see it being useful to retail at
1442.04s: all I mean most prop
1444.38s: like longer term prop guys wouldn't
1446.30s: bother using it either it's really a
1447.80s: market making tool
1450.28s: right on the market all the time
1453.62s: and that's actually the only context
1455.54s: I've heard it in and as well so yeah
1457.16s: that's why I was curious if there was a
1458.48s: use case
1459.64s: uh I don't use it at all so
1464.48s: yeah I think it's a market making thing
1466.40s: bear
1467.96s: one of the other questions that I got
1469.88s: that's actually it's a really fun
1471.44s: dialogue because there's a lot of papers
1473.12s: and a lot of research out there on it
1474.86s: and it is holding leveraged ETFs to
1479.30s: essentially just increase Buy and Hold
1481.22s: returns right so the idea is instead of
1484.34s: holding spy or iwm and the queues you're
1487.76s: holding the leverage counterpart and
1489.92s: there's pretty like interesting two
1492.14s: camps there's the one camp that says oh
1495.26s: no drag is so bad that you can't make
1498.26s: any money and then the the other Camp is
1500.54s: saying well [ __ ] you guys you know it's
1502.40s: good enough
1503.42s: I'm curious if it's something that
1505.58s: you've studied and if so what do you
1507.56s: think about retail Traders holding
1509.60s: leveraged ETFs to enhanced returns it's
1514.04s: it's almost always not a good idea
1517.46s: um
1518.44s: there's a lot going on it's not as
1520.82s: simple as saying there's volatility drag
1522.38s: they always Decay they don't always
1524.84s: Decay it's a very complicated process
1527.36s: for something Sim very simple
1528.80s: mathematically it is a very complicated
1531.32s: process particularly because we don't
1532.88s: know what the actual process of the
1534.74s: stock itself is so we know how
1537.68s: leveraging it changes that process
1541.28s: but we don't really know what it was in
1544.40s: the first place see what I mean so it's
1546.32s: like you can say certain things if you
1547.88s: assume it to Brownian motion and then
1549.92s: you leverage it but it's not so it's a
1552.86s: very complicated process so it's never
1554.54s: as simple as saying they always go to
1556.76s: zero
1558.14s: they do decay
1561.44s: um the mean return will tend to be below
1563.96s: zero like I said it doesn't have to be
1565.94s: and there are plenty of times when it
1567.74s: isn't
1569.12s: um like some of these things have
1570.50s: massively outperformed their reference
1573.50s: product
1575.06s: um can't think of one off the top of my
1576.62s: head but I'm sure they have
1578.36s: um
1580.16s: it's basically a situation where
1584.72s: as with any trade there's an optimal
1587.42s: size
1588.92s: for the trade so basically that comes
1591.98s: back to the Kelly Criterion this is the
1594.02s: optimal growth size and if you leverage
1596.36s: more than that you're going to end up
1598.58s: taking more risk and getting lower
1600.14s: returns and that's the side that most of
1603.56s: these leveraged ETFs are on it's
1606.32s: basically you've got the optimal Kelly
1608.06s: size which might be like 1.2 times
1610.54s: leverage and you've leveraged it to
1613.10s: three times so you're at the point where
1615.86s: you're actually getting diminished
1617.24s: returns because of that leverage effect
1618.98s: okay so if you want a really simple rule
1622.64s: of thumb
1623.96s: take all of your long stock positions in
1628.52s: your long-term stock Holdings and
1631.22s: replace them all by going short the
1633.68s: leveraged
1634.94s: ETFs
1636.08s: so whatever like what's the leveraged
1639.38s: cues is it sqq or something that's one
1642.62s: of them and then there's T triple Q's
1644.18s: yeah because there's there's different
1645.62s: layers of Leverage right you can have a
1647.66s: 2x3x that's the typical breakdown yeah
1650.96s: and
1652.64s: it's not again okay so normally the
1656.00s: higher leverage Ones Will became more
1657.68s: there is a more volatile
1660.02s: but the bigger problem you have to
1661.82s: really look at is your borrowing costs
1663.50s: which a lot of people don't look at so
1665.66s: like right now uh
1668.54s: there's well there's VXX right then
1671.96s: there's uvxi and there's uvx uvxi's one
1676.16s: and a half leveraged
1677.78s: uh uvx is too leveraged so you might
1680.72s: think that the two leveraged one is a
1682.58s: better short than the one and a half but
1684.50s: the two leveraged one right now has got
1686.30s: a 22 borrow rate
1688.28s: whereas the one and a half has got a
1690.80s: three percent borrower rate and if you
1692.78s: look at the expected Decay and put that
1694.76s: in turns out that the one and a half in
1697.40s: this case is a better sale in terms of
1700.28s: risk reward of course it's uvxi which is
1703.40s: now trading at like 2.7 or something
1706.10s: because they're determined for it to
1708.44s: become completely irrelevant I think
1711.32s: um
1712.04s: I don't know what the issue is doing
1713.84s: there I think they've just given up on
1715.28s: it
1716.36s: like they should they should have split
1718.22s: it when it went to 20 and they should
1719.78s: split it till it gets to like 200. it's
1721.88s: another we know what's going to happen
1724.16s: or letting it go down to these levels
1726.20s: just
1727.16s: you can't trade it the transaction costs
1729.32s: are just way too big
1731.96s: and like what would the calculus be to
1734.36s: just let it go is it just becoming like
1735.68s: too much of a burden or they're not
1736.94s: making enough money on issuing
1739.16s: continuing to issue it like what's to me
1741.32s: it seems like you've gone through all of
1742.64s: the work to set it up why not maintain
1744.26s: it until the wheels fall off I have no
1747.08s: idea what they're doing I don't know
1748.82s: could be
1750.62s: could be a lot of things
1752.84s: sure but it's uh it's got to the point
1756.68s: where it's basically in a relevant
1758.30s: product you know if you've got a better
1759.92s: spread of a cent
1761.60s: and you're paying a ticket charge per
1763.94s: share why am I going to trade something
1766.46s: that's 2.7 instead of trading it's VXX
1769.28s: like 35 or something yep it's just
1772.10s: pointless got it another thing that I is
1776.72s: becoming more and more in Vogue lately
1778.94s: that I find Curious is the retail Trader
1783.02s: obsession with
1785.20s: Algos and for retail Traders obviously
1789.86s: it's this brand new novel concept and
1793.64s: to me it seems like there's just a
1796.58s: tremendous amount of focus on it and I
1799.52s: think retail Traders grossly
1801.44s: misunderstand how it might fit into
1803.24s: their world and also just how long it's
1805.46s: been around otherwise
1807.68s: specifically for retail Traders how do
1810.98s: you view AI more importantly Algos for
1815.00s: this question fitting into their
1817.10s: portfolios or trading portfolios
1820.88s: you mean them using it as a way of
1823.40s: generating Alpha
1825.20s: correct
1829.28s: it's very unlikely that someone who's
1833.66s: not a specialist is going to get some AI
1836.48s: algo that can beat the market
1838.94s: it's
1841.34s: I'm not saying no one can but if you
1843.80s: look at the firms that are really going
1845.24s: into this
1846.74s: you know they've got people with phds
1849.56s: and machine learning you're not going to
1851.84s: do a course online or even even an
1855.92s: undergrad course and figure out enough
1858.50s: to beat the market you're not as good as
1860.42s: these guys it's one of those games where
1863.90s: you're just not going to win straight up
1866.30s: against these guys so you have to do
1868.04s: something else
1869.78s: um I I kind of think I mean I use chat
1872.18s: GPT all the time but I basically it's
1876.14s: it's like an intern
1877.82s: it's like instead of me trying to do
1880.28s: something and
1881.78s: one of the hard things about having an
1883.16s: intern is you've got to explain very
1884.60s: carefully what you need done and that's
1886.94s: the same as the GPT app right it's like
1889.22s: you've got to be very clear about I want
1891.80s: you to do this and then this and then
1893.96s: this and
1896.36s: under those constraints it's fantastic
1898.46s: it'll write hundreds of lines of code
1900.14s: and it will do it pretty well it'll do
1901.82s: it a lot faster than me and it's it's a
1904.10s: really great tool but in terms of using
1907.10s: it to predict volatility or whatever I'm
1911.42s: not even gonna
1912.62s: that's just one of those problems that
1914.66s: even if I can do it
1916.76s: there's better uses of my time it's I
1920.66s: think
1923.84s: we have to be very clear that every time
1926.42s: you do a trade you're making a forecast
1929.54s: like some people have this idea I don't
1931.58s: forecast well yes you do you just bought
1933.50s: something so you're obviously thinking
1935.30s: it's going to go up otherwise you
1937.16s: wouldn't have bought it so the action of
1938.72s: doing a trades an implicit forecast
1941.18s: but I think this idea of like trying to
1944.18s: out forecast the market like that
1947.54s: it's just a very difficult problem and I
1950.42s: think people have been somewhat seduced
1952.10s: by this idea of alpha they've got to get
1954.62s: Alpha you don't have to get Alpha you've
1956.60s: got to get money
1957.80s: you know beta counts as money too you
1961.22s: know it's much more likely that you're
1963.14s: going to benefit by finding risk Premier
1965.54s: that are always there and you are going
1968.78s: to essentially get paid for taking that
1970.58s: risk it's a much more likely outcome
1972.74s: than you genuinely finding Alpha by out
1978.02s: forecasting the market
1980.26s: could you yeah sure and if you really
1982.94s: feel like
1984.62s: if you want to do it as a puzzle instead
1987.74s: of like I don't know Sudoku or something
1989.48s: yeah knock yourself out but it's just
1991.64s: not
1992.54s: it's not a very good way to run this if
1994.64s: you're thinking of it as a business and
1996.62s: really trying to make money it's not the
2000.28s: right way to do it it's like with sports
2002.02s: gambling right everyone goes into sports
2003.58s: gambling thinking I'm going to predict
2006.28s: who's going to win this game
2008.14s: and that's not what the pros do at all
2011.02s: like the pros are basically saying the
2014.26s: spreads this the totals that therefore
2017.26s: what should the equivalent spread in the
2019.12s: first quarter be am I just looking at
2021.40s: all these relative value trades like
2023.20s: they practically never try and predict
2025.66s: who's going to win an NBA game because
2028.30s: that market is so efficient
2031.06s: it's the same with the markets right
2034.12s: so you kind of
2036.58s: alluded to another topic that I wanted
2038.68s: uh to ask you about which is chat GPT
2041.02s: and kind of retail Traders using AI to
2045.34s: just enhance their process so from a
2047.68s: retail trading perspective what are some
2050.08s: of the things that you think retail
2053.02s: Traders could or should do with
2056.08s: something like chat gbt or AI in their
2058.72s: trading process
2061.54s: I would caution them against using it at
2064.66s: all I think most people use the computer
2066.28s: too much like this idea that you should
2070.00s: automate all the stuff you need to
2071.56s: automate and people are like well jump
2073.36s: trade into it so it must be the thing to
2075.22s: do
2076.00s: jump trading kind of have to do it
2077.74s: because of the way they trade like if
2080.14s: you're doing hft you need to automate
2082.30s: everything if you're doing
2084.16s: a million trades a day you can't do that
2086.92s: by sitting in front of computer
2088.96s: but I think for your average retail
2092.14s: person you don't want to speed things up
2094.36s: you want to slow things down you want to
2097.06s: actually be more engaged because you
2100.12s: want to learn and the way you learn is
2102.46s: by reviewing every step in the process
2104.74s: so it should be like look at an options
2106.36s: trade right it's a complicated thing you
2109.12s: had to make a forecast of what
2110.44s: volatility is going to be you have to
2112.84s: choose your strike you have to choose
2114.64s: your expiration you have to choose your
2116.26s: re-hedging frequency
2118.24s: how did each of those impact your trade
2120.70s: at the end of the trade you go back and
2123.52s: you're like well my forecast was
2125.50s: slightly optimistic so I shouldn't have
2127.54s: made quite as much money as I thought I
2129.40s: would but then this happened and this
2131.32s: happened and this happened and you
2133.06s: actually have to think through the whole
2134.98s: process and you might find that you're
2137.62s: actually really good at forecasting
2139.24s: volatility
2140.44s: but you're hedging too sloppy so you're
2143.44s: getting too much luck involved and
2145.66s: that's masking the results and if you
2147.76s: don't go through that process you won't
2149.44s: find that out and you're not going to
2151.48s: find that out by automating everything
2153.58s: you know people ask you know what's the
2156.04s: software that you should use like maybe
2158.80s: Excel maybe a Word document but maybe a
2162.40s: piece of paper and a pen you don't want
2164.62s: to be doing this fast you want to be
2165.88s: doing it as slow as you can and people
2170.20s: so there's this thing everyone kind of
2172.42s: knows that you should keep records right
2174.64s: and
2176.68s: people have the wrong idea what you that
2179.14s: process is for it's not about so you can
2182.02s: go back and do statistical analysis on
2184.24s: all your results from three years ago or
2185.98s: whatever I mean I keep records of
2188.14s: everything I do every day
2190.06s: but I have no idea where they are like I
2192.76s: couldn't tell you where my files from
2194.38s: three years ago are because I don't
2195.88s: that's not what they're for what they're
2198.34s: for is for the process of making them
2201.16s: because it makes you sit down and think
2203.26s: about each thing and the slower you go
2205.96s: through it the more you're going to
2207.04s: learn it's about Active Learning it's
2209.32s: not about statistics
2211.36s: so
2212.62s: even if you just do it on a legal pad
2214.30s: and then throw it away that'll be fine
2216.94s: it's not the keeping of them that's
2219.40s: important it's the making of them
2222.46s: I actually
2223.84s: love that and it's probably one of the
2226.06s: most common things I tried to talk to
2227.98s: people about is literally the process
2232.48s: um one of the things I do find chat GPT
2235.36s: useful for and I'm curious what your
2238.36s: thoughts are on this specifically if if
2242.38s: there's a concept let's say they're
2244.84s: reading your book and they come across a
2247.90s: part that they're just they're
2249.28s: struggling with what do you think about
2251.32s: using something like chat GPT to help
2253.78s: them understand that concept or look it
2256.24s: up like one of my favorite things to do
2258.46s: with chat GPT is essentially you know
2260.80s: like the the 80 20 rule whatever you
2263.02s: want to call I think it's Bernoulli
2264.10s: principle or whatever
2265.66s: um but essentially it's
2267.82s: uh the Pareto is that it yeah yeah thank
2270.70s: you the the Pareto Principle where you
2272.74s: know essentially you get a synthesized
2274.90s: list of the highest impact information
2276.64s: do you think that accelerates the
2278.62s: process too much and they're not
2279.82s: respecting the process in that manner do
2281.56s: you view that as an accelerator no that
2283.90s: can be useful I mean I use it for
2287.92s: so one of the things I did and this was
2289.96s: basically I did it because a student was
2292.48s: like trying to convince me it was a
2293.92s: useful thing and so I did this as a
2296.14s: little test but it's a useful way to you
2298.06s: it was a good project
2299.86s: I'm very big on using Monte Carlo
2301.90s: simulations and I typically I used to
2306.10s: have a really great little Excel add-in
2307.84s: that I got free with some book a long
2309.64s: time ago but it doesn't work on the
2311.80s: latest versions of excel so I'd had to
2314.50s: gather a bunch of stuff and then
2317.50s: basically I told chat GPT to write me
2320.20s: one and I gave it like two two
2322.36s: instructions and it pretty much right
2325.18s: wrote the whole thing exactly as I
2327.04s: wanted to and plot the results it'll do
2329.14s: it and it took me like 10 minutes and
2332.50s: it's like 150 lines of code and if I'd
2335.86s: done that it would have taken me the
2337.18s: best part of a week because I'm not very
2338.98s: good at python
2340.90s: so using it for that is fantastic and I
2343.96s: use it for I use it for the intraday
2346.24s: volatility measurement stuff that I do
2348.22s: because I measure volatility at like
2350.26s: four different frequencies and then I
2352.00s: aggregate it and I can just do that by I
2355.96s: had it write all this code in Python and
2357.82s: now I can just hit run in jupyter
2360.76s: Notebook and off it goes it's great so
2363.04s: if you're doing stuff like that it's
2364.24s: fantastic
2365.92s: um but in terms of actually
2368.20s: think of it as a as an intern
2370.72s: you know interns are useful right but if
2373.06s: you had one but would you have one come
2376.54s: up with your Alpha
2378.58s: would you would you get some guy that
2380.26s: has just come you know he's finishing
2381.76s: his third year of college and he's
2383.02s: looking for a job in the summer and
2385.30s: you're like how shall I trade this
2386.92s: option I mean you wouldn't do that right
2389.62s: but you know that Grace it like hey
2391.96s: write me a Monte Carlo simulation
2394.06s: and off they go it's like that it's
2396.16s: great it's it's a fantastic tool and
2400.90s: I think that's that's all it is it's a
2402.94s: fantastic tool but it's not for it's not
2404.92s: going to tell you how to beat the market
2406.06s: because it doesn't know
2408.46s: yeah because the other thing I think
2410.56s: that's good about integrating stuff like
2413.02s: um AI into the process is I also think
2415.66s: it starts to introduce people to AI
2418.96s: because I don't think it's going
2419.80s: anywhere I think it's going to continue
2421.18s: to grow in prevalence going forward and
2423.76s: not just trading just literally in
2425.62s: different assets of life so I I feel
2428.26s: like in general it's a good way to get
2432.10s: familiar with a tool that either you can
2434.80s: kind of evolve with and learn alongside
2438.10s: of it or you could just kind of not pay
2441.22s: attention to it and then you get left
2443.08s: behind but I think that I do think that
2446.92s: AI has a place
2449.98s: in accelerating learning curves but to
2452.80s: your point I think especially for New
2455.44s: Concepts going through that process is
2457.30s: really important for folks
2459.70s: what do you see the future of and this
2463.36s: is the last question by the way I don't
2464.44s: want to keep you too long but what do
2466.78s: you see the future of AI in the markets
2470.26s: in general
2474.70s: um
2477.46s: I couldn't visit your situation where AI
2481.06s: takes away
2482.94s: most of the market liquidity providing
2485.86s: stuff like
2487.96s: we've seen in the crypto World these
2491.02s: amms right these liquidity providing
2493.60s: pools and uni Swap and stuff and
2495.64s: obviously they've got problems right but
2497.38s: that isn't even AI That's Just the
2499.36s: simplest possible algorithm
2502.48s: even going back to the early 2000s
2507.52s: um I was developing a market making
2509.92s: system a kind of an automated Market
2512.14s: making system which was based on a very
2514.18s: simple application of what a market
2515.80s: maker would do and it basically encoded
2518.44s: that
2519.34s: that was using technology that's 25
2521.86s: years old now and I think AI is going to
2525.16s: be able to do that way better than a
2527.98s: human Market maker will it'll be able to
2529.96s: manage it will see all the flows and be
2533.08s: able to react to all of them absolutely
2535.18s: optimally not just
2538.14s: semi-optimally like a human does and a
2541.24s: human basically is quoting a spread not
2544.66s: just to collect the spread but to
2547.30s: immunize themselves against the fact
2548.80s: they're not doing everything perfectly
2550.18s: so AI won't need it anywhere near as big
2553.06s: a spread and it will be better and I
2556.42s: think a lot of those kind of jobs
2559.24s: you know like especially on the Delta
2561.76s: one side facilitation desks you know
2564.64s: Market making and vanillas all that kind
2567.10s: of stuff I could see that completely
2568.66s: being automated
2570.82s: um the things that it won't be as good
2573.04s: at uh
2575.02s: the things that don't have a set process
2578.62s: you know the things where you might have
2581.20s: a customer calling you up and saying I
2584.26s: kind of want to do this but I'm not sure
2586.84s: what do you think
2588.52s: you know it's like this is an old joke
2590.44s: that a computer can beat a grand master
2593.38s: at chess
2594.94s: but they can't put the pieces back into
2597.22s: the box
2598.36s: so computers are really good at doing
2600.28s: hard stuff but they're not actually all
2602.74s: that good at doing ill-defined easy
2605.38s: stuff that people are good at so I think
2607.84s: the other jobs that are going to stay
2609.46s: around
2611.20s: um but I also kind of think there's a
2613.36s: decent chance that AI just takes a look
2615.22s: at us and decides we're not worth a
2616.66s: hassle
2618.24s: I mean there's never been
2621.70s: this isn't my observation this is the uh
2624.34s: the chief AI guy from Google who
2626.74s: resigned uh a while back he said that
2630.40s: there's never been a situation in the
2632.32s: world where a less intelligent group
2636.22s: ruled over a more intelligent group
2639.46s: I mean you can make some joke about
2641.02s: politicians here but I think at the
2643.06s: species level that's absolutely true
2644.86s: right we're not being we're not being
2647.98s: ruled by the picks here
2650.20s: so
2652.36s: I could definitely see that happening I
2654.40s: don't think all of the stuff around AI
2657.34s: is alarmist I think there are problems
2659.50s: that it could come up with
2662.32s: um so we'll see how that goes
2665.14s: yeah the other question I have
2666.94s: specifically related to AI how do you
2668.98s: think the inclusion and I had a similar
2672.58s: hypothesis where a lot of the market
2675.10s: making liquiding provided roles
2678.04s: likely could get phased out how do you
2680.86s: think that that would impact the
2682.98s: long-standing market function slash
2685.60s: forces that we see like the variance
2687.46s: risk premium in indices or just put call
2690.22s: skew things like that do you think it
2692.26s: would have any impact or would the
2694.12s: overall disposition of human beings on
2696.64s: the back end still wanting that
2698.62s: protection still willing to overpay
2700.36s: allow it to persist
2702.34s: yeah I think that's the sort of thing
2704.98s: that is driven by
2707.38s: people's desire to avoid risk and it may
2711.10s: become tighter that's because the
2713.68s: computer might see like I I'm always
2717.10s: selling Vol right and I but I also have
2720.82s: a certain degree of risk aversion
2723.46s: that would mean that I might not be
2725.26s: doing it as aggressively as I should be
2727.24s: and a computer's not going to have that
2729.34s: but on the other hand the computer it's
2731.38s: not the computer's money right it's
2733.54s: someone's money and they're going to
2735.28s: have these issues too
2737.02s: so I think things like that will always
2739.54s: be around
2741.40s: um
2742.24s: I think it's purely the the matching of
2744.82s: buyers and sellers that could change and
2746.80s: to be honest that's happened already you
2749.50s: know like 30 years ago if you were an
2751.84s: options Market maker you might make
2754.18s: markets on three stocks
2756.46s: but now I mean when I left it was an
2759.70s: options Market maker would make markets
2761.44s: on a hundred now it's like five or six
2763.90s: hundred so the the automation of that
2766.30s: process is already well underway so now
2769.24s: instead of having one human do five or
2771.34s: six hundred why don't you just have a
2772.66s: computer do the whole lot
2774.58s: I mean it's not revolutionary it's just
2777.66s: continuing along that process
2780.22s: right and kind of scaling interesting
2784.66s: um okay the very last question because I
2786.46s: always lie to you on the last question
2788.02s: and then there's always one more and
2790.24s: then uh I'll let you go for real but
2792.88s: have you studied the volatility around
2795.76s: the debt ceiling conversations
2798.36s: uh yeah kind of
2801.58s: um
2802.42s: we don't really have enough data to say
2804.76s: anything
2805.90s: um
2807.28s: it and each one has been against a
2810.64s: fairly different backdrop
2812.74s: so
2814.18s: I can't really find anything that I
2816.88s: particularly believe and if you look at
2819.28s: this time
2820.54s: volatility really didn't do anything the
2823.96s: market really didn't do anything the
2825.76s: market had sort of got to the point
2827.26s: where
2828.52s: it's like watching a horror movie right
2830.50s: look we we know how this is going to
2832.78s: play out you know you don't want to be
2834.58s: the good looking blonde girl we know
2836.68s: what's going to happen to her and why is
2838.66s: she going into the basement all alone
2840.10s: but we know the whole thing right
2842.08s: it's like that it's like we kind of knew
2843.88s: how it was going to end we didn't know
2845.62s: the exact steps but really
2848.68s: it's very straightforward right both
2850.72s: sides want to basically blame the other
2852.46s: side
2854.26s: um whatever happens the president's the
2856.60s: one who gets blamed the most
2858.52s: and that's pretty much
2860.50s: that was like that under Obama and Trump
2863.26s: and Biden same old same old
2866.56s: so
2867.88s: let's find the market really
2869.80s: didn't care and there were a lot of
2872.14s: people like oh the vix is way too low
2874.24s: because of this debt ceiling right which
2877.96s: is a classic example oh really it's too
2880.00s: low well the Market's not moving and do
2882.46s: you think you're the only one who knows
2884.08s: that this issue is out there I mean that
2886.12s: you're going to have to have a better
2887.08s: reason for that for why the Vex is too
2888.88s: low
2889.90s: so turns out the Vex wasn't too low it
2892.48s: was if anything was too high right
2894.94s: the part that I find interesting is like
2899.26s: we know with relative certainty the
2902.74s: likely outcome but we don't know with
2905.38s: pure certainty and if big if
2909.90s: uh it wasn't there was no agreement for
2912.88s: whatever reason and there was a default
2914.68s: like obviously the risk there is just
2916.90s: massive so that's the part I find so
2919.42s: curious about the event is that it's a
2922.00s: very high probabilistic determinable
2923.98s: outcome but the risk on the other side
2927.40s: in that small percentage of cases that
2930.64s: it could not happen would be pretty big
2932.32s: so I was curious how just longer term I
2934.90s: started looking at it myself but
2936.10s: obviously I'm like a [ __ ] Caveman
2937.60s: with this stuff compared to what you can
2938.98s: do that's why I was asking you I
2943.12s: I don't think this is good even if there
2945.88s: was a default right which would be huge
2948.46s: I don't think it would be nearly as big
2950.26s: a deal as it happened inside the 50s
2952.24s: sure
2953.68s: um America is not the world's
2956.08s: overwhelming economic power to the way
2958.12s: it was back then
2960.04s: and also to be honest
2962.02s: these idiots have been messing around
2964.00s: with this stuff for so long that this
2966.82s: whole idea of America being absolutely
2969.28s: risk-free funds No One Believes that
2971.62s: anymore you know I wouldn't be surprised
2973.78s: if there's another credit downgrade
2975.52s: because
2977.38s: if you keep acting like an idiot with
2979.78s: the credit eventually people aren't
2981.64s: going to be surprised when something bad
2983.20s: happens and it's not at the point where
2985.66s: it's like Bolivia or anything but it's
2988.84s: not it's not Switzerland now either you
2991.60s: know and we have seen Sovereign Nations
2993.52s: have defaults before like and reasonably
2997.20s: you know big Sovereign Nations you know
3000.24s: like I don't know what the biggest
3002.10s: economy to have a default has been but
3005.22s: I don't know because Italy defaulted
3006.90s: Mexico has defaulted a whole bunch of
3008.22s: times Mexico is huge you know so if it
3011.10s: did
3011.94s: I don't think the world would end
3014.70s: um obviously it would be bad for the US
3016.14s: markets but I don't think the market
3018.06s: would crashed 50 or anything
3021.06s: right yeah that makes sense it's
3023.76s: somewhat ludicrous that Congress can
3025.80s: authorize spending and then decide not
3027.72s: to pay for it it's so funny you say that
3030.60s: I had a an economist on the podcast last
3033.66s: week and that was actually one of the
3034.86s: questions I was talking to him about
3036.12s: because to me it seems so strange to
3039.24s: create a budget with the known spend
3041.34s: projected spends like we know where
3043.32s: we're going and yet we come into this
3046.26s: and I was also looking at the frequency
3048.62s: specifically because I think what 1917
3052.02s: or something like that it was one of his
3053.46s: first instituted the debt ceiling and
3055.86s: then in the 40s is when it was starting
3057.30s: being activated a lot more but like in
3059.34s: the last two decades is when we're we're
3062.10s: having them at a decent clip and I I to
3065.28s: me yeah I just struggle with it because
3067.08s: like to me it makes no [ __ ] sense
3068.52s: like we know where things are going why
3071.22s: is this happening why don't we just have
3073.14s: a bigger budget or whatever the [ __ ] is
3075.00s: or not overspend but yeah yeah here we
3077.64s: are well right it's not even about the
3080.52s: level of spending it's the fact that
3082.02s: these are two separate processes I mean
3084.54s: that's just no matter what you believe
3087.30s: about government spending levels that is
3089.40s: just ridiculously dumb and it's one of
3092.34s: those things that people kind of I think
3094.02s: up until recently
3096.00s: kind of just accepted because it didn't
3097.62s: happen that often
3099.00s: but also it wouldn't happen I don't
3101.34s: think anywhere else in the world this
3102.66s: could happen the government could
3103.80s: authorize spending and then say Oh by
3105.60s: the way we're not paying for the stuff
3106.86s: we said we were going to pay for right
3108.90s: without defaulting right that is like
3111.30s: I'm voting to spend this money now I'm
3114.00s: voting that we can't spend this money
3115.80s: like
3117.72s: welcome to America this makes no sense
3120.00s: at all
3121.80s: um well you know it's it's how America
3123.90s: does what it does right you never let
3126.00s: them know your next move because we
3127.74s: don't know our next [ __ ] move well
3131.60s: it's
3133.14s: a lot of the stuff about the the
3135.54s: American
3136.62s: political system
3139.44s: there's always a reason why each
3142.08s: incremental step happens right so we
3144.30s: know why the Electoral College came
3146.34s: about I get that we know why the Senate
3149.34s: has the structure it has on the other
3151.80s: hand it has got us to a place that makes
3154.08s: no sense right right and it's like I
3156.60s: don't think it's a coincidence that
3158.34s: every other democracy that's come along
3160.50s: since had a chance to look at the
3162.60s: American system and no one has said
3165.18s: we've got to go with that I'll take that
3167.88s: one yeah yeah they've really worked that
3169.62s: one out
3170.58s: it's yeah and these are even like
3173.70s: democratic governments that the
3175.62s: Americans have installed
3177.84s: like they didn't go to Afghanistan and
3179.58s: said come on guys where's your electoral
3181.08s: comp you know college
3183.60s: yeah it's it's interesting and I think
3185.64s: the part that always I find so
3187.26s: intriguing about it is like I know these
3189.06s: aren't stupid people that's what I
3191.04s: always go back to is sure you know they
3193.26s: have their leanings and all that kind of
3194.70s: stuff but most of the people there
3196.38s: they're they're legitimately not dumb so
3199.32s: it just tells you the amount of
3201.06s: structural stuff around that kind of
3203.82s: puts us in these interesting scenarios
3205.68s: but yeah
3207.84s: yeah there's I mean there's a whole
3209.46s: bunch of problems right I think the fact
3211.26s: that the highest level of the Civil
3213.96s: Service is political appointees
3216.26s: always creates this level of takes a
3220.08s: while for people to get up to speed
3221.34s: right and as opposed to the certainly
3224.46s: the commonwealth countries whether the
3226.50s: civil service is all
3228.12s: you know that's their job it's not a
3231.12s: political appointment so even if the
3233.34s: politicians are all completely idiotic
3235.80s: the underlying Machinery is run by
3238.56s: people who know how to run them that
3240.02s: thing it's you know it's like in the
3244.08s: military interestingly doesn't have this
3246.96s: right I mean the Joint Chiefs of Staff
3249.06s: are not like some guy who was a good
3252.00s: campaign contributor right I mean it's
3254.10s: no it's this guy's an ad boy he spent 40
3257.10s: years in the Navy
3258.48s: but we don't do that with a lot of the
3260.16s: other
3261.18s: uh departments yeah that's actually kind
3264.30s: of an interesting juxtaposition huh
3267.06s: well
3268.14s: I think it probably tells us something
3270.42s: right yeah I mean and it's easy to make
3273.12s: fun of you know there's the whole
3275.18s: Catch-22 and mash and everything about
3277.80s: how the Army has run so ridiculously and
3281.28s: at a micro level it kind of is but it
3283.08s: has a huge Logistics operation it's
3285.18s: amazing
3286.38s: so
3287.88s: I mean it's really good that like
3290.94s: forget about the blowing things up that
3292.74s: the fact that the American Military can
3295.44s: put thousands of tons of Provisions
3298.50s: anywhere in the world in a matter of
3300.84s: days is incredible yep
3303.84s: yep and I mean I'm a former logistician
3306.72s: so that's literally what what we would
3308.76s: do is we would look at how to put a
3311.10s: giant Force off of somebody's doorstep
3313.10s: and be ready to put them closer if need
3316.80s: be and it's exactly that point it's
3318.60s: funny like if you read anything with Sun
3320.88s: Tzu or you know Klaus wits it's the
3324.18s: ability to support a large fighting
3326.58s: force that makes such a massive
3327.90s: difference so yeah it's it's Logistics
3330.24s: that win Wars yeah right I mean everyone
3333.54s: talks you know everyone's all enamored
3335.40s: about the special forces and all this
3336.90s: kind of stuff but yeah it's
3338.58s: it's putting putting thousands and
3341.04s: thousands of pounds of you know
3343.26s: Munitions in the right place is what you
3345.18s: need it doesn't matter how good your
3346.62s: troops are if they can't eat
3348.72s: right right
3351.12s: to wrap us up I'm curious have you done
3354.00s: uh any driving has it been nice weather
3355.86s: there
3356.70s: hasn't been very nice weather
3358.92s: um I haven't really done anything much
3360.54s: I've got a few problems well always but
3364.26s: um one of the problems is my
3366.18s: my pop-up headlights I can have a choice
3369.18s: of one being up or both being up so I
3373.20s: have to have both of them up all the
3374.76s: time at the moment so I've got to get
3376.02s: that fixed
3377.58s: um also my wipers aren't working which
3379.98s: car is this
3381.18s: that's the 456. got it the 308 I think
3385.44s: is working fine but I haven't taken it
3387.06s: out yet because the weather hasn't been
3388.80s: very good
3390.48s: um and also now that you've said that
3392.34s: I'm sure when you sit in the car it
3394.86s: probably will have heard that in The
3396.30s: Ether and then it will find something to
3398.22s: be upset about well yeah I mean
3400.32s: obviously
3401.34s: things always break
3403.38s: um also it might be too hot now you
3405.18s: don't really want to be driving an 80
3407.10s: degree weather well 80 plus it gets too
3409.68s: hot are they is that one air cooled or
3412.94s: no it's it's not so much the engine the
3415.74s: engine's fine it's me
3419.90s: so it acts like a little and it's got
3422.28s: big Windows big engine behind you acts
3425.88s: like a little Greenhouse yeah yeah
3427.68s: fishing doesn't really do anything and
3429.30s: if you take the roof off you just end up
3431.04s: you know getting sunstroke got it yeah
3433.98s: cause I was gonna say that's it would be
3435.66s: mind-blowing to me because I know there
3437.04s: there are some people that do air cool
3438.54s: conversions just for two different
3440.64s: purposes but
3442.14s: um it would have been really interesting
3443.34s: to me if you did that so the the gross
3445.38s: heat Factor makes a lot more sense
3447.62s: the car's fine right it's just that I
3451.26s: would probably
3452.94s: die yeah it gets really hot in there
3456.36s: well instead of going to a sauna you
3458.76s: just go for a drive you know
3461.16s: um yeah I also get deaf you don't get
3463.26s: Deaf from the sort of
3465.36s: there's um yeah the the Carson coffee I
3468.18s: think I sent you a photo of a 48 I saw
3470.58s: there one time but there was a F40 this
3473.10s: past weekend that was just absolutely
3475.86s: gorgeous beautiful car I've never been a
3478.98s: huge fan of them to be honest they're a
3480.96s: little extreme and it seems like based
3482.52s: on your cars at least of what I know
3484.08s: that you have it definitely seems
3485.46s: contrary to your general style but for
3488.40s: what they are 288 a lot right right you
3492.48s: know because it's basically a 308 on
3494.16s: roids I mean it's got no panels the same
3496.80s: it's a 308 but it looks like a bigger
3498.90s: one
3500.16s: um
3500.94s: but I don't know that's an old car you
3505.62s: know in an old super high performance
3507.48s: car just a lot of work probably isn't
3510.00s: much fun to drive
3511.62s: yeah I never been in one myself but I
3514.20s: remember I looked into it and I'm not
3516.54s: like huge or anything but the the seat
3519.12s: was so narrow I I was just looking at it
3522.90s: as yeah it's got the big bolstered seats
3525.54s: right exactly
3527.16s: yeah it's actually a bit weird a lot of
3529.20s: the like the 308s got really really
3531.24s: really thin seats because you know
3533.88s: they're astonishingly comfortable
3536.52s: I mean what they look like you'd think
3539.10s: there's no padding at all and they're
3540.54s: actually well they fit me perfectly
3542.64s: well I feel like you also kind of
3544.14s: learned to respect the ergonomics of the
3546.24s: seed as compared to you know how much
3548.16s: thickness or cushion there is if you
3550.26s: have a well-shaped beep I actually think
3553.02s: yeah it makes a ton of sense that that
3555.00s: would be way more comfortable what do
3556.74s: you think about the um
3558.72s: the Lamborghini Diablos
3561.24s: no Diablo is nice okay it's like the
3563.76s: last real Lamborghini yeah I I I I saw
3567.84s: one of those now that just Audis yeah
3571.80s: yeah I don't like Lamborghinis at all
3574.20s: anymore but all of the pre Audi ones are
3576.42s: fantastic I love them yeah the uh there
3580.08s: was a Diablo there that was just it was
3581.94s: so cool especially it wasn't too far
3584.10s: away from the F40 so is it kind of a
3585.90s: chance to check them both out next one
3587.10s: another but hopefully the weather gets a
3590.40s: little bit more decent for you guys
3591.48s: there to get some wheel time in it's
3593.10s: been
3594.18s: I don't know it's been cloudy here but
3595.68s: at least temperate so it's actually been
3597.12s: pretty good driving here
3598.50s: yeah we've it's been overcast here a lot
3600.96s: overcast kind of dull this is the first
3603.42s: hot day we've got I don't know how hot
3605.04s: it is it's probably like 90. [ __ ] it got
3608.34s: hot today yeah
3609.78s: I'm starting off to somewhere with a
3611.70s: bang I suppose yeah well
3613.92s: it was a long time coming but yeah it's
3615.78s: hot yeah
3617.58s: well you and thanks so much for hanging
3619.32s: out I honestly I just have a blast
3620.88s: chatting with you so thanks for sharing
3622.74s: some of your experience with folks
3623.88s: talking some cars and looking forward to
3626.82s: the next course whenever that uh that
3628.68s: gets announced let me know I'm happy to
3629.88s: share with my community and yeah get get
