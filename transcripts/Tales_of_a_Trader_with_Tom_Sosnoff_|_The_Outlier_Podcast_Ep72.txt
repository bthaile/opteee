2.40s: what's up everyone welcome back to the
3.68s: outlier podcast I have Tom snoff back
7.08s: with us do you like my nuner voice I
8.80s: feel like when I'm talking casually it's
10.60s: like a normal voice then whenever
12.00s: introduce somebody I really try to lay
13.28s: it on for you yeah yeah that's good
15.40s: that's good your voice
17.20s: good well it's great to see you again um
20.08s: I always enjoy the opportunity to pick
21.52s: your brain a little bit see what you're
22.64s: thinking about things today I want to do
25.16s: two things I wanted to first pick your
27.24s: brain about current markets obviously
29.64s: but then I also wanted to spend a little
31.08s: bit of time towards the middle SL later
33.28s: half of the session talking a little bit
35.04s: more about like the beginner Trader
36.88s: Paradigm and the way that you think
39.92s: about some different elements around
41.84s: that so I figured we could start with
43.44s: the broad Market though what's stuck out
45.24s: to you today other than the fact that we
47.52s: we did get a down tick I know that
49.56s: that's something that you tend to look
52.24s: for well probably what stuck out the
54.36s: most to me today was that there was
56.36s: there was no two-sided trade I mean it
59.52s: was D from the opening BT and they you
62.36s: know it feels like for most of 2024
65.64s: whenever they were down when they open
68.24s: lower there was always some kind of
69.44s: Rally or head fake or whatever and today
72.12s: it felt like you know there was n none
75.48s: of the above um there wasn't an uptick
78.12s: all day so I I think that was the
80.24s: biggest difference for me is that I was
82.00s: kind of waiting I was kind of waiting to
84.20s: see if they would you know try to bounce
86.12s: them or at least have a little bit of a
87.20s: rally at different points and uh that
90.00s: was pretty ugly all day yeah it was
92.32s: really interesting I thought too because
94.72s: to me it seemed like we started getting
96.48s: some earnings coming out being ingested
98.92s: and obviously Tech was leading the pack
102.24s: down to me it seemed like Tech is in a
104.88s: spot where it essentially has to deliver
107.20s: almost perfectly or exceed on earnings
109.36s: in order for the market not to have this
111.44s: kind of response but how do you look at
113.92s: that um well the Market's
117.28s: been hyperbolic this year and it's been
119.96s: really tightly concentrated so for me
122.92s: you know I I I just look at it as we
125.08s: were grossly overbought I mean
127.52s: personally I wish we went down last
129.68s: month because that's when I had more
130.96s: bullets to the downside but I didn't I
133.36s: didn't reload all my you know downside
135.72s: positions which I'm sorry about um but
139.88s: you know again I I think it's I think
143.64s: it's long overdue I think a selloff of
145.84s: this nature is long
147.40s: overdue you know that's all that's fair
150.32s: enough now how do you get a sense of
152.92s: when it's due versus overdue because I
154.84s: also know the last time you don't it's
156.36s: it's not it's not even you can't it's
158.72s: just it's something that you know I mean
162.68s: in this business of course timing is
164.48s: everything but um given the magnitude of
167.68s: the up move this year there's absolutely
169.92s: no way you could catch this down move
172.48s: because like I caught this down move a
175.32s: little bit but I've
176.60s: also got caught in the last three stages
180.04s: of the up move which I already thought
181.24s: were overbought so it doesn't get you
183.12s: back to even so it's not even worth it
184.96s: you know you know so so yeah you can
187.04s: catch a little bit of the down move but
189.12s: but at the same time you know you're
191.52s: fighting you probably put yourself in
194.44s: that position three or four times
195.88s: already this year when it just ran you
197.72s: know basically ran over your face yeah
200.24s: that's exactly what I was curious about
201.56s: because I know that you had the the last
203.44s: time we spoke was about a quarter ago
206.04s: and you had your Nvidia fade on um yeah
209.48s: it did work it didn't work like I mean I
212.04s: got some money back in the last you know
214.28s: month but it was crappy you like you
216.12s: know when you get your face ripped off
218.92s: it's hard to you know you got to be
221.76s: careful about throwing good money after
223.36s: bad you know I thought Nvidia was
225.44s: overpriced when it got to
227.56s: $650 I didn't think it was going to you
230.32s: know 1,00 and then split it right yeah
233.92s: and so then that is my follow-up
235.96s: question though when you look at
237.28s: something where it does seem like the
238.80s: market does start to agree with your
240.72s: thesis is now at your point it's too
243.16s: late the move kind of already started to
244.92s: unwind or do you like how you well it
247.04s: really depends on the situation it
248.68s: depends on the you know on the year that
250.44s: it happens and when it
253.00s: happens
254.56s: um say that again what with Nvidia sorry
257.48s: um I was saying let's think about Nvidia
259.12s: now just to parameterize the way I mean
261.16s: it's it's harder it's harder for me to
263.24s: get short Nvidia here now um
267.64s: because you know I think I think the way
271.48s: that the way I think of trading is um it
275.96s: it's difficult to reload after let's
278.52s: call it a 20% you know pullback when
281.76s: when you've been run over in a certain
283.36s: stock so you're kind of wondering you
285.20s: know you're always looking over your
286.60s: shoulder you're not you're not firing
288.52s: from a position of strength as a Trader
291.24s: so I think the best thing to do is to
293.44s: kind of just you know get back as much
295.36s: as you can and then start from you know
297.96s: start thinking kind of clearly again
300.24s: don't make it don't make it don't let it
301.60s: be personal that's for sure right that
303.88s: makes a ton of sense so what other kind
305.92s: of things do you look at now like in
307.76s: today's market what interests you for
309.32s: trade ideas well I looked at a lot of
311.36s: things today I mean I know there were
313.08s: some people nibbling on the buy side um
316.40s: I didn't really I mean I I did very
319.24s: small in you know I'm a little bit long
321.60s: like you know I've been playing a couple
323.68s: earnings plays but I look for things
325.88s: that I think are grossly oversold and I
328.24s: stay a little bit long those and I um
332.64s: and I try to keep the rest of my
333.88s: position relatively delta neutral keep a
335.80s: little bit of short Delta like in all
337.16s: the indices and stuff like that but I
339.24s: also look for some things I think are
341.12s: you know like as we close today I
342.40s: thought the bonds got kind of cheap when
343.72s: they traded down to 118 and that was a
346.20s: buy point for me so you know I got a
347.80s: little bit long bonds I I will mess
350.24s: around with things I think are very
351.92s: oversold but um I'm not trying to fade
356.68s: I'm a contrarian but I wasn't ready to
358.20s: fade this move yet got it and what do
360.88s: you think about Smalls I know last time
362.52s: we spoke you were bullish in them and I
365.88s: remember that distinctly because I had a
367.88s: I've been super bullish in the small
369.60s: caps um relative to everything else and
373.56s: we've been eating crow on it all year
375.76s: long in the last three weeks we got
377.76s: everything back and some it's been an
379.84s: absolutely freaking huge move today was
381.84s: a monster um so so we finally you know
387.44s: it's been like the worst trade in the
388.68s: world because when you're wrong for four
390.80s: or five straight months and then you
392.04s: make it all back in two weeks you got to
394.28s: have like the biggest balls in the world
395.72s: to hold that thing I held it but most
398.00s: people can't yeah well I I started using
401.84s: just kind of trailing stops to to make
403.96s: it a little easier for me to to scale
405.56s: myself out a little bit but luckily it
407.12s: was essentially parabolic what did you
409.28s: make of that move though because to me
411.04s: that that was actually it makes sense to
413.40s: me I mean I pears pears are the only
417.28s: things that actually you know that I bet
419.24s: on to normalize in price um and I mean
423.32s: it shouldn't take this long I mean but
426.24s: the back the back has been broken now
428.72s: and I don't think you can I think you
430.80s: have to be long small caps and short
433.24s: everything else into perpetuity from
435.16s: this point now when I think of that kind
438.92s: of thesis I've been really surprised
441.72s: with the move in Tech as well obviously
444.80s: and today it looked like if I'm not
446.20s: mistaken the Spy is actually up year-to
448.28s: dat over the q's now
450.48s: does that mean you could be right I have
452.16s: no idea I don't know yeah let me double
454.92s: check so it looks like year to date the
457.24s: s&p500 is up 14.63%
479.56s: weit them differently or is it just they
481.28s: but you get a short you get a short yeah
483.08s: don't care no I wait them based on ivr
486.04s: so it's just you know my biggest
488.32s: position right now is in iwm but only
490.08s: because of ivr so it's all short premium
491.80s: in iwm got it makes sense when you look
495.56s: at the performance of bonds and we had
498.68s: the recent change a little bit in the
501.08s: rate picture starting to you know expect
503.88s: some cuts and stuff like that Bond's
506.88s: movement what do you think of it makes
508.68s: sense doesn't make sense
510.28s: the bond movement recently has made
512.44s: sense to me because I'm I'm not um I'm a
516.76s: buyer of bonds on any dip but I'm not
518.92s: really bullish on bonds um I think
521.60s: they're going to trade in a in a really
523.68s: narrow range um under 118 kind of where
526.84s: they closed today right around that 118
528.48s: level um I like the bonds under 118 I
532.04s: love the bonds at 115 or 116 I'm okay
535.56s: with the bonds at 117 and 118 I I'm not
539.24s: a buyer at 119 or 120 so that shows you
542.20s: I'm a very I'm in a very tight range
544.92s: here I'm a buyer you know one or two
548.28s: handles lower than one or two points
549.88s: lower than here I'm a seller you know
552.92s: 121 122 so I think the bonds are in a
555.92s: very tight range I think the bonds are
558.32s: the only thing that has been somewhat
560.60s: politicized and
562.92s: um uh you know I I'm I'm
568.00s: guessing I'm guessing that the bond
570.20s: market
571.68s: will will be a little bit stronger if
574.56s: Trump has the lead and a little bit
576.76s: weaker if he loses the lead but who
579.36s: knows we'll see the move that it made
582.80s: what was it like a year ago from like
584.68s: 127 to like 107 or something like that
587.28s: 130 to 105 I forgot
591.12s: um can you contextualize that for me
593.72s: like over the course of your career how
595.84s: does that kind of move stack up for you
598.76s: well that was a pretty that was a pretty
600.72s: heavy down move you know when it got
602.60s: when it broke under 120 and went down to
604.48s: you know 107 108 that that was pretty
607.00s: significant because it was relentless
608.72s: over a short period of time yeah but I
611.28s: don't think I think it paled in
612.76s: comparison to the up move from you know
616.16s: 130 to 170 and
619.00s: so the up move was absolutely freaking
621.64s: violent the down move was was more of
624.40s: like you know we were all like I know
627.64s: myself and a bunch of other Traders we
629.12s: started to get long in that 112 113 down
631.84s: to 109 area and by the time we got
634.04s: through 109 we were way too long already
636.48s: but but I liked that area and you know
639.16s: it obviously tortured us at 106 107 but
642.20s: it didn't last there very long went
643.52s: straight back to 120 um on the down move
646.40s: uh when bonds went higher and interest
647.88s: rates went lower that move from you know
650.52s: from 125 130 to 170 that was violent and
654.48s: it never corrected for like the longest
656.28s: period of time and the yield curve
657.96s: inverted in the process so that was just
659.96s: freaking
661.28s: nasty yeah so now with it hanging around
664.24s: like 118 where do you see normalized
666.96s: price as the rate environment changes or
670.16s: do you think that this is just operating
672.32s: I think the rate environment the rate
674.00s: environment is all predicated on what
676.12s: the bonds do at
678.12s: 116 they they had there's no rate cut at
681.12s: 118 there's one and at 120 there's
684.52s: probably two I think it's just totally
687.00s: dependent on where bonds go if they're
688.60s: stuck here at 18 you know don't count on
691.80s: much at all maybe a crappy little one
694.36s: lot Ray cut one one Ray cut but if they
697.04s: get down to 116 I don't even think
698.44s: you'll see a ray cut and if they pop
700.52s: back up over 120 it could be one or two
703.56s: now how do you arrive at that just for
707.36s: everybody else's General learning
708.88s: because obviously the bonds were down at
710.60s: 107 right so then and then they got up
713.16s: to I think like 125 or was that like the
715.96s: beginning 125 126 yeah they did yeah so
719.04s: like but there was no rate changes much
721.60s: during that at least to the to the
722.96s: cutting side so like when does the bond
725.52s: price movement become informative of
728.32s: rates whenever the FED has to get
730.96s: together and talk about rates the bond
733.04s: prices are are the FED is never going to
736.12s: fade bond prices it's mathematically
738.52s: impossible like if bonds are dropping
741.00s: the FED cannot lower rates if bonds are
744.00s: rising you know price the FED cannot
746.16s: raise rates period the end of the story
748.76s: The Market Marketplace drives the fed
750.52s: the FED does not drive the marketplace
752.68s: so in this case the FED is the Fed is
757.28s: not driving the car the bond Market's
759.16s: driving the car the fed's in the
760.40s: passenger seat it's always been that way
762.64s: and it always will be that way the FED
764.60s: is just a is just a symbolic it's just a
767.08s: figurehead for what H what's happening
768.64s: in the bond market and then how do you
771.64s: understand like what bands would then
773.60s: Force the fed's hand for a bond who
775.76s: cares who cares uh well for me I care
779.28s: from a contextual standpoint trying to
781.32s: understand that relationship like when
782.60s: the FED is sitting down looking at rates
785.20s: how do they you know we we're obviously
787.04s: saying Bond informs fed that makes sense
789.44s: I follow that yeah but I'm trying to
791.64s: understand that actual relationship one
792.92s: is the Fed say Okay Bond Market's doing
795.84s: it's hard it's hard to say but you can
798.72s: just think of it in terms of you know
801.04s: like you know two points make a
803.72s: difference but but I I it's very hard to
808.20s: think about the bond market and the
809.76s: stock market in a macro sense and it's
812.20s: very hard to put like tie to hard
814.24s: numbers I mean the the CME has a Fed
817.12s: watch tool which is really effective and
819.60s: it's pretty much spoton you know from an
821.96s: odds perspective but the way to think of
824.08s: bonds is every two points higher or
826.36s: lower put different cuts back on the
828.56s: table but that's it got it okay and then
833.92s: historically have you guys seen the way
836.40s: that the FED responds to that are they
838.68s: generally responsive because one of the
840.56s: reasons why I ask all this is because
841.92s: yeah they have they have no choice they
843.44s: that that is their job they they they
846.52s: the um the bonds Drive the FED there is
851.92s: no nothing else to it got it the yeah
855.24s: the reason why I ask is because this
857.44s: recent rate environment is really
859.64s: interesting to me because I I've been
860.80s: hearing a lot of like macro people
862.44s: talking about uh you know the fed's late
864.96s: the fed's late the FED should have cut
866.24s: already the fed you know the FED should
867.40s: do this the FED bonds are saying this so
869.40s: I'm just continually trying to
871.20s: contextualize that stuff but I mean I
873.84s: always find that's the the tricky part
875.32s: about macro is it's kind of uh yeah well
878.48s: the FED also has a more challenge in an
880.48s: election year because they have to act
881.96s: like you know they have to play the role
884.20s: of you know Switzerland they have to be
886.36s: independent and they the the Integrity
889.00s: of the FED depends on is really
891.48s: dependent on their on their indep you
893.80s: know on on how objective they can be
896.80s: objectively independent so it's
899.52s: important that the FED maintains that
901.60s: level of integrity and uh so I I I don't
907.04s: think in a perfect world I don't think
909.40s: they're
910.68s: gonna do anything that's outside of bond
914.12s: prices I just don't think they can yeah
916.76s: got it makes sense yeah and thank you
918.20s: for the context I know some of that
919.56s: stuff might sound Elementary to you but
921.76s: I think a lot of people they hear that
923.64s: statement of you know bonds lead the FED
927.20s: but it's sometimes difficult to to
929.12s: connect those when you're looking well
931.56s: the bond bonds trade in real time and so
933.68s: anytime you have a real-time Market
935.16s: that's you know that's a few hundred
937.00s: billion dollars deep um you can't
940.44s: there's no other way to think about it
941.72s: like I mean do you want the real prices
943.76s: or do you want like somebody's you know
946.28s: somebody's spitballing and telling you
948.56s: what the FED should do no you just look
950.28s: at the bond prices that your your whole
952.00s: Market's there got it yeah when you look
956.28s: out over the rest of the year and you
958.32s: see the p500 you know in the first half
960.92s: of the year is up almost 20% yeah what
964.20s: do you think about the rest of the year
965.36s: in that kind of circumstance yeah I
967.68s: think you're probably going to see a
969.76s: market that's that's I think a little
972.16s: bit lower for the rest of the year um I
974.36s: just think 20% is pushing it to an
976.24s: extreme so maybe you're up maybe you
978.56s: drop 5% from here to the rest of the
980.44s: year or something you know not in any
982.48s: particular order but just I think you're
984.40s: going to be
985.28s: lower yeah have you guys done studies on
987.92s: that to see like the no there's no
990.24s: there's no real price mean reversion or
992.60s: normalization in price um there is with
995.80s: pairs trades and because the spreads
998.12s: kind of expand and contract and there is
1000.48s: with volatility but not with price got
1002.96s: it somebody um had a question for you
1007.20s: they heard that you had played poker
1010.20s: with Michael
1011.28s: Jordan yeah what was that
1014.36s: like what was it like yep um well it's a
1019.24s: game that lasted for 18 years no like
1023.48s: maybe 16 years so need some
1028.56s: context
1030.12s: context
1031.84s: um
1034.00s: when when the Bulls drafted Jordan in
1038.40s: 1984 the Bulls stunk they they were the
1042.04s: worst team in the NBA or among the worst
1045.32s: teams and um nobody went to Bulls games
1049.68s: like 3,000 people 4,000 people so the
1053.20s: Bulls were trying to sell tickets and
1055.56s: they decided when they drafted Jordan
1057.28s: they're going to try to sell floor seats
1058.72s: they didn't never sold them before so
1060.92s: they figured the best place to start was
1062.40s: at the Board of Trade because they would
1064.52s: go to all the Traders because because we
1066.56s: were impulsive and we had money right
1069.36s: and we were kids like we you know we
1071.00s: were in my 20s you know whatever I was
1073.24s: only like three years older than Michael
1074.92s: or something and um four years older
1077.28s: than Michael and so um
1079.40s: so they knocked they they just happened
1081.16s: to get off the elevator like the Bulls
1082.72s: ticket team and they knocked on our door
1084.92s: like like the one of the first doors
1086.20s: they knocked on and we're sitting there
1089.00s: and they took out a map of the United
1090.52s: Center not the United Center at the time
1091.96s: it was Chicago stadium and they put it
1093.76s: on our desk and they go you can have any
1095.76s: seat you want on the floor and and I
1098.56s: remember this day like it was yesterday
1099.88s: and we're like and we're like well yeah
1102.32s: but we don't know if this kid like we
1103.72s: know Jordan's good because he won a
1105.48s: national championship but we like we
1106.68s: don't know if he's going to be like NBA
1108.84s: they great like we didn't know and
1111.52s: they're like well just take any seat and
1113.84s: you only have to buy him for one year
1115.80s: and they were $75 a game which back then
1120.16s: in 1984 was like the most expensive seat
1123.24s: you could ever imagine
1125.12s: $75 so there was there was four of us in
1128.32s: the office and we had a really good day
1130.68s: the day before so we said [ __ ] it we'll
1133.64s: buy we'll take the four seats at Center
1137.12s: Court right in the middle you know
1139.28s: and the best the best four seats in the
1141.68s: in the Chicago stadium so the Bulls are
1145.40s: writing up the contract they doing it
1146.68s: all by hand right in front of us and my
1149.08s: buddy who is still here today working
1152.04s: you know here today he goes no no this
1154.12s: is this is dumb
1156.40s: because
1158.08s: because why do we want to sit at Center
1160.16s: Court because you know let's sit at the
1162.64s: end of the bench because Jordan if he's
1165.04s: any good he he always sits at the last
1167.72s: seat on the bench it's his thing in
1169.28s: college and high school you know he'll
1171.52s: always sit on the last seat at the end
1172.84s: of the bench he doesn't sit on the bench
1174.64s: with everybody else let's take the four
1177.04s: seats at the end of the bench because in
1178.36s: the in the Chicago Stadium the the fans
1183.64s: seats are right next to the players's
1185.24s: bench there was no room in between so we
1188.52s: decided okay we're like what we didn't
1190.12s: care because it's only one year we don't
1192.24s: care so we we took the four seats by the
1195.12s: end of the bench and four of us so we
1198.08s: went to the first like two home games
1200.84s: and after the second game we're like
1203.64s: holy [ __ ] this kid's this kid's not good
1208.16s: he's like he's another after two games
1211.68s: we're like he's another freaking level
1214.44s: like he is we've never seen him like it
1218.72s: so so all of a sudden you know there's a
1221.40s: little buzz in Chicago that year he wins
1223.32s: rookie of the year next year he breaks
1225.60s: his we we renew the tickets he breaks
1227.60s: his foot but then he back against the
1229.28s: Celtics you know scores like 64 points
1231.96s: and blows up the whole league and all of
1233.96s: a sudden like Jordan is you know born
1236.44s: he's a superstar he's the be you know
1238.72s: he's already the like one of the best
1240.08s: players magic and bird are still around
1242.28s: and the Pistons were still there and we
1244.32s: end up you know he starts to become
1246.92s: whoever Michael Jordan is and one night
1249.40s: I think it was his second year in the
1251.76s: middle of the game he he leans over and
1253.24s: he goes what are you guys doing tonight
1254.44s: because we were bullshitting with them
1255.68s: every night you know because we sit at
1257.12s: the end of the bench and we go it was
1259.28s: like a Thursday night we're like nothing
1261.48s: he go I go what do you want to do he
1262.68s: goes he goes I want to play cards he
1264.76s: goes after I do my TV hit after the game

1314.28s: cash then all we did was had cash so we
1316.88s: play this huge game of poker and guts
1319.20s: and all this crazy stuff and we wiped
1321.56s: him out in like an hour and he lost all
1325.76s: five grand now he's pissed because he's
1327.48s: really competitive I was gonna ask that
1329.64s: much money then you know he's like he's
1331.32s: like he's on his crappy rookie contract

1340.88s: lend you the money you know like you're
1343.16s: good we know where you live he goes I
1345.68s: wouldn't borrow money from you
1347.08s: [ __ ] ever he goes he's he has a
1350.00s: bodyguard with him so he sends a
1351.32s: bodyguard out to get more money kid

1387.96s: straight to the trading floor and the
1391.56s: next day I slept whatever and that
1394.08s: started 15 years worth of like going to
1398.92s: the game at night and then playing a
1402.12s: poker game you know at one of our houses
1404.96s: a l most of the time it was at my house
1406.64s: or another mother bu's house but the
1408.68s: thing with Jordan the funniest thing is
1410.20s: that that he's the only person in the
1413.20s: world where you can call your wife on
1415.48s: like a Wednesday night or a Thursday
1417.64s: night and say hey we're playing cards

1422.64s: morning on a Wednesday night and they're
1425.72s: like okay no problem I'll go get some
1428.12s: beer like like if it was any of my other
1430.76s: friends she would have shot
1432.96s: them but with Jordan she'd be like she's
1435.96s: like whatever you want Michael like you
1437.52s: know it's it's
1439.00s: crazy so so sorry go ahead that was it
1443.20s: that was it went on for like literally
1444.92s: 15 years so did he ever end up getting
1448.52s: any of his money back or did you was he
1450.32s: just ESS he ended up in the end he
1452.32s: probably killed us you know really yeah
1455.76s: he he was good and um yeah he got all
1458.60s: his money back and and the game was very
1460.72s: we kept the game like to just a small
1463.32s: group of of Traders and you know we had
1467.00s: some we had some rules like no
1468.68s: autographs no asking you know no talking
1472.52s: like you know no no like pictures no
1475.08s: autographs and um and we kept the game
1478.16s: to like the same like we rotate like a
1480.44s: total of 10 people so in Chicago it
1482.60s: became a thing like how do I get in that
1484.00s: Jordan game you know like we didn't let
1486.08s: anybody in it was just my friends and it
1489.04s: was it was crazy and um it went on for a
1492.04s: long time and then and then you know
1494.12s: through all the Championships and
1495.36s: everything and our tickets became crazy
1497.76s: valuable because they ended up you know
1501.00s: being the tickets ended up being
1503.84s: gold so floor seats next to Jordan were
1507.04s: the most valuable tickets in the world
1509.04s: did did your buddy ever who had the idea
1511.68s: of picking those instead of Center Court
1513.48s: does he does he make sure to hang that
1514.96s: over everybody's head or
1516.60s: no yeah kind of for the for a couple
1519.04s: years but then you know it it it wore
1521.48s: off I don't know I feel like I wouldn't
1523.76s: let that go for you guys that I would
1525.36s: make sure you know it it was a great
1527.60s: story the whole ride was you know the
1529.52s: six championships everything was amazing
1531.48s: you know I mean then he got just too big
1534.08s: you know he got you know he got he got
1537.16s: he was you know he was on a different
1539.52s: level I mean he got to a point where we
1542.32s: weren't big enough for
1543.80s: him yeah well you kind of have to you
1547.12s: expect that at some point especially
1548.48s: when he's the essentially the goat of
1550.40s: basketball but did you learn anything
1553.56s: from him when you guys play poker
1555.04s: together no I mean he was was a
1559.64s: interesting character because he didn't
1561.36s: have like a crazy amount of friends I
1563.16s: don't think and
1565.40s: um um so we were like these weird
1568.48s: friends of his that because you know we
1570.44s: were just different you know he liked us
1573.64s: because we like to gamble on anything
1575.08s: and he likeed to gamble on anything so
1576.88s: that was the relationship um you know we
1579.40s: would talk we would laugh a lot you know
1581.84s: it's just it was just like guys night
1583.52s: out you know that's all it was it was
1584.76s: not nothing it was just um you know
1589.12s: played golf a little bit played some Jin
1592.04s: you know did a Vegas trip not with him
1594.36s: but met him in Vegas you know like crazy
1595.92s: stuff like that but it was it was a
1597.88s: great stories to tell my kids you know
1600.56s: it's good did they ever a chance to meet
1602.92s: him yeah that's cool yeah he asked my
1605.64s: daughter wants to open a beer for her
1608.16s: for him and um she was like told
1611.00s: everybody in her school 50
1615.44s: times that's so awesome yeah and the the
1619.56s: Vegas
1620.56s: trip I know can't go too deep cuz it's
1623.92s: Vegas but what do you guys do there just
1626.08s: go gamble a
1627.36s: bunch yeah they were playing a preseason
1629.72s: game and um in a preseason game in Vegas
1633.20s: and and we happened to be in Vegas the
1635.32s: same weekend so we went to the Mirage
1637.40s: and we played um we played uh backrack
1641.28s: all night long on the in a private like
1643.64s: area but it was fenced off and it was
1645.76s: really fun Rodman was there I think
1648.36s: Rodman was there and maybe somebody else
1650.60s: but it was a crazy night and um I think
1653.76s: we all got killed but whatever who cares
1658.16s: yeah uh gotta ask about Rodin though
1660.28s: because everything I've heard about like
1661.88s: the interviews I've seen about him and
1663.40s: stuff is that he apparently is a bit of
1664.92s: a party animal yeah I don't really know
1668.56s: I I've heard stories um but and I know
1671.64s: some people that know him I I never I've
1673.92s: only met him I didn't know him at all um
1677.28s: he was a little bit of a loner you know
1679.40s: but um
1681.88s: I I have a buddy that knows him really
1684.36s: well because Robin stayed his house for
1686.16s: a couple of months so so you know so
1688.60s: they have so he told me some stories but
1690.76s: he he I I guess he's a pretty decent guy
1693.12s: I just don't know the whole deal yeah I
1695.52s: was just curious what he would have been
1696.60s: like in a casino you know if you have
1698.28s: like the the the reputation of being a
1700.32s: bit of a party animal it kind of reminds
1701.76s: me of like the the D I'm sure he was I'm
1704.56s: sure he was nuts but you know like yeah
1707.52s: at that point you know I don't know like
1709.44s: you know they were
1711.44s: all they were legit like crazy super
1716.20s: like they were they were in a different
1718.08s: League of you know the status those guys
1721.56s: had you know just as as superheroes was
1725.60s: insane and could you imagine anything
1728.48s: like that today now with like social
1730.12s: media and stuff I imagine like those
1731.60s: kinds of relationships be so hard today
1734.88s: yeah they'd be hard because I I don't
1737.80s: think Jordan was a um I don't think he
1741.08s: was an alter Boy by any stretch and uh
1744.64s: but who is you know who is yeah I know
1748.00s: no I know I know but I don't think you
1750.36s: know I I don't know you know the amazing
1753.76s: thing with him is that like there' be
1755.20s: nights when he would score you know 35
1758.28s: or 40 points and then he would you know
1763.16s: hang out with us till 5 in the morning
1765.64s: drinking beer and smoking cigars and
1767.64s: then the next day he scored 35 right
1770.84s: like he had energy that's in I he was
1774.12s: insane like
1776.96s: insane and that stuff's incredible too
1779.44s: because you hear of other great players
1781.08s: like Kobe Bryan and he almost has a a
1783.48s: different approach right where Kobe
1784.92s: Bryant at least I've never met him right
1787.04s: so I don't know but from the things I've
1788.68s: watched about him he seemed like
1790.72s: straight into the discipline right he's
1793.04s: like going to the gym twice a day like
1794.76s: after practice and stuff like that and
1796.64s: then you have people like Mike that run
1798.64s: it like that it reminds me of uh much
1801.00s: less fun story but it reminds me my time
1803.24s: in the Marine Corps there were dudes
1804.40s: that we would run the PFT it's like a
1805.68s: three mile run and they they would
1808.00s: literally be smoking cigarettes before
1809.52s: they go run and they would crush me I
1811.44s: would just watch them just run right by
1812.92s: me and it was some people are some
1815.52s: people are weird he was one of those I
1817.80s: think one of those Jeremy ronic who's a
1819.84s: h was a hockey player in you know for
1821.76s: the um Blackhawks and and and other
1824.80s: teams I think he's in the Hall of Fame
1826.60s: and ronic tells a story which is I
1828.40s: didn't know Jeremy Rick but he's kind of
1830.56s: one of these party guys too just a he's
1832.48s: a Bruiser like you know he's a tough guy
1834.36s: big guy tough guy you know definitely a
1836.92s: fighter that kind of thing talks about a
1839.20s: time when he played 54 holes with of
1841.64s: golf with Jordan and then and then that
1844.08s: night you know Mike went out and scored
1846.20s: like 45 points and ronic said he
1848.40s: couldn't even walk and he's a you know
1850.16s: he was an athlete he's like I couldn't
1851.56s: even walk when we were done and he plays
1854.20s: and he goes out and scores 45 points you
1856.04s: know that it's crazy it's abs incredible
1858.52s: and especially just like that kind of
1859.68s: athleticism that that's just so cool any
1862.00s: other fun poker games that you've played
1864.44s: memorable pork CER games yes but nothing
1867.12s: like that what's the what's the what's
1870.12s: the next
1872.28s: one Oh you mean our games like the next
1875.56s: one in that list so you have playing
1877.44s: poker with Michael Jordan at 12 to 04
1881.08s: before you go to work and he goes to
1882.36s: play basketball that's that's pretty
1883.48s: hard to beat what's like the next
1885.48s: threshold on your list of poker games
1887.24s: that have been really cool but maybe not
1888.80s: quite
1889.96s: there oh that's a that well we're not
1893.68s: you know when we say we played poker
1895.92s: there was a lot of stupid games that
1897.80s: were played like you know we logged a
1900.44s: lot of Jin too like a lot a lot a lot of
1903.32s: Jin so and Jordan played Jinn too so
1905.76s: there was a lot of Jin played got it for
1908.52s: a lot of money but um uh I don't know
1912.68s: there's nothing that really compares to
1914.20s: that I mean you know to show you how
1917.04s: crazy we were I'm I'm going way back
1918.76s: okay this is not anytime recent this is
1921.08s: way before this is when we're back on
1922.92s: the floor but we used to play so many
1925.64s: card games that we would order cards
1929.28s: from the used cards from the Golden
1931.60s: Nugget 1,500 decks at a time so the
1936.56s: Golden Nugget and the Mirage both both
1939.08s: they were both Steve wi places and God
1942.00s: they would sell their used cards for
1945.12s: about a dollar a deck and they were the
1946.96s: really good cards but they but they
1948.56s: punched them so they had like a hole in
1950.48s: them so because they were used but they
1952.72s: would sell them to us for I want to say
1954.20s: a dollar maybe a little bit less and
1956.08s: they would but we had a minimum of, 1500
1958.04s: we had to buy and we went through about
1960.40s: 1,500 decks of cards a
1963.28s: month holy [ __ ] so that's what it was
1967.12s: like oh my God
1971.76s: yeah that's and that went on for a long
1975.04s: time that's super intense so then then

2105.80s: racket ball court so they sold these
2108.08s: racket ball courts that were you bought
2110.56s: the kit so I bought the kit and put a
2113.56s: racketball Court in the house and that's

2132.92s: down
2134.48s: um uh not well not
2140.44s: easy no wonder why the markets don't
2142.92s: phase you right you just women women
2146.48s: that marry
2148.04s: Traders they deserve what they get
2150.80s: especially in the 80s you know like it
2153.28s: was it was her fault for marrying me
2155.92s: like it was just a mistake and none of
2159.36s: these guys were good h no nobody I knew
2162.76s: was a good husband but in our defense
2165.64s: they weren't great wives either it was
2168.44s: not it was it was a it was a there
2172.12s: nobody was perfect here okay it was a
2174.24s: different world mutually costic
2176.60s: relationship that blossom into a
2178.40s: beautiful marriage it's perfect yeah
2181.00s: yeah there was it was
2183.40s: not yeah they're not going to write any
2185.44s: books about this is the um this is the
2188.20s: perfect family and uh um yeah yeah
2192.08s: there's nothing no family values in that
2194.68s: relationship in any of those
2196.24s: relationships back then none perfect
2198.68s: well that's a value in and of itself
2200.20s: right you flexible that man I can only
2204.08s: imagine the the relationship that you
2207.76s: guys built with Jordan over that time
2210.12s: frame because I imagine you guys you
2211.28s: were talking about keeping keeping it
2213.20s: like not Fanboy right just keeping it
2215.48s: normal like this just a guy no we kept
2217.64s: did very normal you couldn't be a fanboy
2219.36s: I don't even have I don't even have a
2221.96s: Jordan signature on anything which is
2223.88s: amazing at this point I got nothing um
2226.68s: not one not even I don't think I have
2229.20s: one thing I have a the only Jordan
2231.56s: signature I have is on a white socks
2233.60s: Jersey that's probably
2235.96s: fake damn it I figured that you guys
2238.44s: would at least broke like just one just
2240.56s: just one day where you guys could have
2242.76s: done your signature stuff just
2245.08s: one no we didn't not even once that's
2249.92s: nuts not even once it was kind of it was
2252.68s: a it was a it was an Unwritten rule well
2255.44s: and it's also respectful to him because
2257.36s: I I do think it's the same thing that
2260.48s: you see with other people right like
2261.84s: sometimes you just want to be normal
2262.92s: right just want to feel normal and be
2264.60s: able to yeah so I think that part's
2266.88s: really cool I still probably would have
2268.72s: brokered one signature day like just one
2271.24s: thing you wouldn't have you think you
2273.48s: would have but you wouldn't have because
2275.24s: you're just too you don't want to ruin
2276.60s: it you just want to let it we would have
2277.88s: shut you down and then we would have
2279.00s: kicked you out of the game come back
2281.68s: honestly I suck at poker so I wouldn't
2283.36s: have been there very long anyways I I
2284.80s: would have been there for a few we all
2285.80s: suck at poker we all sucked at
2288.72s: poker I hate poker poker is the most
2291.60s: boring game in the world I feel I go
2294.52s: with my buddies I have a bunch of
2296.32s: buddies that love to play poker they
2298.36s: think they're like pros but they're not
2300.60s: but they love they love going to the
2302.48s: casinos and like two or three times a
2304.76s: year I'll go with them to in Chicago we
2308.20s: have you know some poker some poker some
2310.08s: casinos and poker rooms and I'll go to
2312.40s: with them to have dinner and then play
2313.64s: poker and after two or three hours I
2316.60s: can't handle it anymore like I'm just
2318.64s: all in I want to lose my money I just
2320.44s: want to get out of there right right
2322.04s: yeah Ju Just give me an out yeah it's so
2324.32s: slow I can't take it it drives me crazy
2327.24s: so then if you had to pick a card game
2328.56s: as a
2329.56s: Jin oh well Jin's more fun for us to
2332.80s: play as like because you could play as a
2334.20s: as as a teams we like it so it's fun and
2338.24s: uh it's more there's more table talk um
2341.04s: poker's a little less table talk so it's
2342.96s: not as much fun um but we've have lots
2346.04s: of games but yeah I guess you
2348.60s: know yeah it's because anytime I like to
2351.40s: gamble I'll I'll play Baka or I'll play
2354.80s: craps and it's oh yeah yeah oh in a
2356.96s: casino we we'll play we play everything
2359.60s: yeah well I always feel like something
2360.84s: like craps it's decent Edge if you play
2363.64s: well it's never you know positive Edge
2365.40s: but like at least if you can lay lay
2366.96s: odds it's not terrible and there's a lot
2369.92s: of yelling which is the best yeah yeah
2372.52s: we I like noise so I like it when the
2375.00s: games are
2376.36s: Rowdy it's the it's the entire reason to
2378.92s: do it because you know you're playing
2380.32s: with something that's what sucks about
2381.48s: poker poker's quiet it's kind of boring
2384.36s: yeah I guess to and I mean how
2386.84s: representative of that is of trading
2390.08s: right like the thing that's quiet boring
2391.96s: has Edge baked into it technically if
2394.00s: you're good at it and the thing that's
2395.72s: loud rockus it's the reasons we built
2398.44s: tasty to tell you the truth it's one of
2400.08s: the reasons we built tasty because we
2402.88s: loved this business we loved the open
2405.88s: outcry aspect to the business we loved
2408.52s: like the locker room part to being on
2412.04s: the floor yeah you know once you got
2414.12s: through some of the mechanics we loved
2417.08s: just the fact that it was just noisy and
2420.72s: stupid and you know the conversations
2423.76s: were just idiotic and the the chatter
2427.08s: was non-stop it like kept you so engaged
2430.16s: and we tried to create that same
2431.48s: environment in the companies that we
2432.92s: built and we've done a good job we're
2435.76s: we're we're not we're not the best HR
2438.68s: firm in the world but we're not the best
2441.48s: we're not the most politically correct
2443.60s: um but we've been able to keep ourselves
2445.88s: out of out of trouble out of litigation
2447.96s: for 25 years so we've done something
2450.72s: right I imagine you're finding people
2453.44s: that align with the values which is
2455.08s: massive because that we hire a lot of
2456.72s: tra a lot of Traders yeah yeah which I I
2460.28s: mean that's one of my favorite things
2461.36s: about Traders is that there's Traders
2462.88s: from essentially every background you
2464.48s: can think of but there's immediately
2466.44s: some threads yeah we we you
2471.00s: know over the years we we it was very
2474.48s: difficult it was almost impossible to
2476.64s: know who was going to be a good Trader
2478.68s: and who you know now it's easy because
2480.84s: now now it all comes down to um it's
2484.36s: much more mechanical it's much more all
2486.16s: about smarts so now it now it's a
2489.12s: function of you know smarts and math and
2493.92s: um and your just ability to just make
2497.36s: all the numbers make sense but back then
2500.16s: it wasn't back then it was very physical
2503.08s: um and it was very different and it was
2505.96s: much more mental Game Theory you know
2509.36s: just lots of different things involved
2511.88s: compared to today so everything is has
2514.44s: completely shifted today um today today
2517.44s: it's today anybody's everything's equal
2520.20s: back then it was not the case right
2523.32s: speaking of today when you look at like
2526.40s: new Traders and the problem set that's
2529.84s: in front of them if you take a brand new
2532.72s: Trader from today versus 30 years ago
2536.44s: specifically focusing on
2538.16s: today what like what are they trying to
2540.40s: solve for as far as you can tell like if
2542.52s: you're talking to a brand new Trader
2544.16s: that's saying I want to trade what's the
2546.40s: direction you send them I I don't know
2549.64s: that I'm not sure what they're trying to
2552.04s: solve for um I mean different people
2555.04s: have different reasons for wanting to
2558.36s: learn to trade um for some people it's
2561.80s: obviously that it's it's new it's
2563.96s: intriguing it's exciting for others they
2567.76s: they've reached a point where they want
2569.04s: to learn how to manage their um through
2572.20s: trading they can learn you can learn
2574.68s: more faster um through trading than you
2577.36s: can any other way as a passive investor
2579.72s: you know it takes you 50 years there's
2581.88s: that makes no sense so as a Trader you
2583.88s: can accelerate um your learning process
2587.08s: by you know 100x so some people do it
2589.88s: for that um other people figure out that
2594.28s: that it's really helpful for
2597.04s: decision-making and and really helpful
2599.56s: for you know it makes them much stronger
2601.96s: in every other aspect of their life risk
2604.32s: assessment probabilistic assessment um
2607.44s: statistics probabilities you know
2609.72s: strategy all the above so I think
2612.32s: there's there's different reasons why
2614.84s: different people choose to be Traders um
2618.40s: or choose to trade um for some people
2621.32s: it's a compliment to for other people
2622.92s: it's a Time suck um which is all good
2626.44s: you know I mean there's a lot of when
2629.44s: you think about your life there's an
2631.92s: incred people have you know um people
2635.68s: have the ability to waste enormous
2637.72s: amount of time you know just between
2640.36s: watching Netflix and you can go down a
2643.00s: Netflix Rabbit Hole you can go down an
2645.20s: Amazon Rabbit Hole a YouTube rabbit hole
2648.24s: you can go down easily down a Tik Tock
2650.24s: Rabbit Hole you know and you can there's
2653.52s: lots of other things you know you can do
2655.60s: to um I wish I had back you know the the
2659.80s: the two three years of my life which are
2661.96s: probably equaled you know walking around
2663.68s: a golf course you know trying to take
2665.92s: money from my friends you know like I'd
2668.32s: like to have that time back and you know
2670.52s: so so I think that um one of the things
2674.72s: that I've learned from Trading over the
2676.40s: years is that it's made me into a very
2679.36s: successful entrepreneur because it's
2681.40s: taught me a lot of things about you know
2684.60s: differentiation
2686.28s: articulation um you know how my brain is
2691.20s: is I make very fast decisions they're
2693.80s: not always right but you know I can make
2697.12s: a decision before you finish asking the
2698.84s: question and so that's you know
2702.68s: throughout the years most of the
2704.48s: successful entrepreneurs that I've run
2705.92s: into are incredibly fast decision makers
2709.28s: like they they they they don't listen
2711.24s: very well but they make really good
2713.48s: decisions I people that listen drive me
2715.80s: crazy because because because listeners
2720.76s: are not Traders Traders like can they
2723.64s: they'll tell you six different people
2725.60s: are telling six different stories
2727.00s: simultaneously and somehow you're
2728.56s: picking up all bits and pieces of each
2730.52s: of each story so I I'm not a really big
2733.80s: fan of listeners you know I like people
2736.48s: that don't
2738.04s: listen I could see why though because
2740.92s: listening in that context is really
2742.56s: passive so I should make a t-shirt that
2745.80s: says that I like people that don't
2747.28s: listen I love that yeah it's it's very
2751.08s: on brand too um so then if you think
2755.84s: about new Traders then in this context
2759.76s: of being able to make quick decisions
2761.88s: but there's a bit of a uh Paradox here
2765.72s: right because most new Traders limited
2767.36s: capital and there's just a million
2770.36s: stupid mistakes you can make early on to
2772.76s: lose your trading Capital to start how
2774.52s: do you strike a balance there do you
2775.72s: think it's really hard you go that's why
2778.96s: we preach the whole trade small trade
2780.68s: often because um you you have to create
2785.12s: enough occurrences in order to learn and
2788.16s: you have to create enough occurrences or
2790.72s: in order to create a predictable outcome
2793.00s: it's the whole law of large numbers it's
2794.80s: absolutely in play in the trading world
2797.00s: but the other side to it is that people
2799.48s: are emotional people are egotistical
2803.16s: people are you know stubborn um people
2806.40s: are very undisciplined people like to
2808.92s: think that they they have you know
2811.92s: embedded inside everybody is this crazy
2814.24s: gamblers fallacy which you know which is
2817.52s: which is really hard to get around if
2819.44s: you've never traded so because there's
2822.28s: you don't have enough places in your
2823.72s: life where you can experience that kind
2825.36s: of you know that kind of decision-
2827.00s: making um or the need the need for that
2830.16s: kind of decision- making so there's all
2832.16s: these issues and I think you get around
2834.56s: those through trading if if you can get
2836.56s: to that point you know it's hard it's
2839.00s: hard even on the trading floors you know
2841.24s: there was a 95% failure rate and that
2845.84s: that's with Edge you know in the retail
2848.04s: world it's probably you know I think
2850.60s: it's it's it's a much flatter world now
2852.56s: and the fees are a lot less so so it's
2854.72s: it's the success ratees higher but it's
2856.72s: not high
2859.00s: enough yeah so if you're talking to a
2862.16s: new Trader what tips do you give them to
2864.96s: drive that success up trade small
2867.04s: straight off and one of them obviously
2869.24s: beyond that um yeah the whole concept of
2871.60s: trade small tradeoff and is great the
2873.56s: two that I really think are important um
2877.20s: it and and again the the I can't
2879.84s: emphasize enough the trading small piece
2882.44s: because that was the hardest hurdle for
2884.64s: us to get over the next two would be um
2889.16s: stay stay in the most liquid underlyings
2892.04s: there are like just make sure liquidity
2895.64s: is your friend so make sure you stay in
2898.16s: liquid underlyings and then I really
2901.12s: believe strongly like it's it's I'm over
2904.56s: the top on this that you have to manage
2906.96s: stuff early you cannot let stuff go to
2910.08s: where the the end of a cycle can can
2914.60s: wipe out a single trade you have to
2916.96s: manage trades early you reduce risk you
2919.84s: reduce the volatility your own
2921.64s: volatility and you reduce your risk so
2923.84s: dramatically you essentially eliminate
2925.24s: your outlier risk and the one thing that
2927.20s: kills people is outlier
2929.44s: risk now something I saw somebody
2932.04s: mention in a comment somewhere on this
2934.76s: exact thread where the the a of managing
2937.44s: early they're curious and I I thought it
2939.40s: was a good idea I obviously have a bunch
2941.28s: of thoughts on it but I want to hear
2943.28s: yours which are if the the general
2947.00s: thesis 45 days manage about 21 once we
2950.68s: get within 21 a lot of these other
2952.60s: things come out of the woodwork their
2954.76s: question was well then why isn't it at
2957.16s: 21 why don't you just inverse take the
2959.60s: other
2961.48s: side
2963.12s: um it's a fair question yeah that's what
2966.24s: I thought it's but but it's an easy
2969.16s: answer exactly it's not because the odds
2974.44s: change at 21 days it has nothing to do
2977.52s: with that it's that it's the
2980.88s: magnitude of it's a magnitude of the
2984.20s: change in the Decay curve where you end
2987.60s: up taking so much more risk so what what
2991.20s: that means is the reason you don't flip
2992.56s: the cards over is if you put a trade on
2994.48s: at 45 days and you let it go let's just
2997.24s: say as an example and you let it go to
2999.96s: expiration and let's say your chance of
3002.12s: success is
3003.88s: 65% then in the end if you do enough
3006.04s: times it's going to be 65% if you put
3008.48s: the same trade on at 45 days and you
3010.84s: take it off at 21 days your probability
3014.12s: of success is still going to be 65% so
3016.76s: there's no difference your 65% if you
3019.52s: take it off for 21 days and you're 65%
3021.68s: in the end if you hold it all the way to
3023.36s: the end the difference is that the
3026.20s: dollar you make per day between 45 and
3029.92s: 21 are about 35% more per day your p&l
3035.32s: per day than if you hold it from 45 to
3038.04s: zero so the reason you take it off is
3040.40s: not to flip the cards over it's because
3042.88s: the amount of money you make on a
3045.08s: dollars per day for taking the same
3046.88s: amount of risk is significantly greater
3049.88s: and that's why it is the optimal point
3052.08s: in the Decay curve got it and you
3055.00s: mentioned an important part there of
3056.72s: risk adjusted basis correct because
3058.32s: obviously Theta would accelerate as we
3060.56s: get within that 21 day window of course
3062.68s: so as you get inside of 21 days you are
3065.12s: going to have some time when that when
3067.00s: when those positions are going to you
3068.64s: know they're going to be unbelievable
3069.88s: and they're going to work in your favor
3070.92s: and you're G to have other times when
3073.20s: when your losses you know it's just the
3075.44s: speed at which your positions move at
3077.16s: that point and it gets to be much more
3079.68s: difficult to control you know as you get
3081.76s: close to expiration it's very hard to
3083.44s: control Delta when you have time to go
3085.96s: it's very easy to control Delta and
3087.44s: that's the difference like imagine a day
3089.96s: like today you could not
3092.52s: control you know if you had a if you had
3095.00s: a daily option on today you're dead if
3097.24s: you had a weekly option on today you're
3098.96s: dead you could not control your risk in
3102.56s: in the zero days the one days or the
3104.16s: three days today you know or the seven
3106.48s: days in the 45 days it was challenging
3109.20s: but you could do it but in the in the
3111.56s: weeklys you couldn't even possibly you
3113.60s: had no chance you're
3115.12s: buried Canen conf irm that whole little
3117.64s: buried thesis looks uh real accurate on
3120.32s: the Zero DTE SPX stuff today that uh
3123.64s: yeah yeah lines right up um a couple
3127.32s: more questions for you before you uh you
3130.72s: have to run okay if you were to advise a
3134.36s: new Trader these are the X number of
3138.08s: things you should focus on for why
3141.04s: period of time what are the things you
3143.80s: think they should focus on and for how
3146.24s: long and just to table the question I
3149.32s: find when I talk to a lot of newer
3151.04s: Traders there's same thing with me it
3153.72s: feels like you're wasting time so then
3155.64s: you try to do a a bunch of stuff super
3157.60s: fast to try to get caught up and it
3159.12s: tends to be very [ __ ] so that can be
3162.20s: tough to control so that's the the
3164.28s: origin of the
3169.48s: question so the question is as a new
3173.44s: Trader MH you know what are the things
3176.16s: you going to focus on and for how long
3178.76s: that's the the second part's
3181.16s: important when you say how long do you
3183.32s: mean like how long should it take not
3187.04s: necessarily how long it should take but
3188.88s: how long they could expect to spend like
3191.48s: truly focusing on this thing before they
3193.88s: feel really familiar with
3198.52s: it you know it's it's
3201.20s: funny when I first started in this
3204.00s: business and everything was you know the
3205.68s: old school open outcry by hand um that's
3209.76s: crazy by the way the shortest period of
3211.80s: time it took was a year but for most
3213.92s: people it took you know two or three
3216.00s: years and I know because we had a prop
3218.16s: firm we backed a lot of people it was
3220.12s: almost impossible to ramp anybody up in
3221.88s: a short period of time one to two years
3225.84s: minimum nowadays it's very different
3229.00s: because playing Field's level the
3231.12s: technolog is great uh the fee struct the
3233.64s: fees are are commoditized the market Mar
3236.64s: are incredibly liquid um you know
3239.64s: there's a penny wide markets for
3241.00s: everything I would say that the
3243.60s: fascinating thing today is that you can
3247.64s: essentially
3249.52s: um if you if you are able to stay small
3253.08s: enough and make enough small trades you
3255.68s: can ramp up in you know 30 to 60 days
3259.88s: and you can be very confident in your
3263.60s: understanding of what's going on doesn't
3265.04s: mean you making money
3267.08s: but I think you need to go through one
3269.32s: full 45 day cycle and you know and then
3272.92s: whatever adjustments and everything Happ
3274.56s: so so you know 30 to 45 days to get 30
3278.56s: to 60 days in a 45 day cycle in there to
3281.64s: really make enough um introductory
3285.04s: trades to get your feet wet and to get
3287.60s: comfortable um I don't think you can
3289.64s: turn the corner that quickly I think
3291.56s: that takes longer but I think you can
3293.72s: get to the point where okay I dig you
3296.80s: know this is fun
3298.44s: stuff I see what you mean there and I
3301.72s: think one of the the parts like to me as
3304.52s: I hear you say that I think that's
3306.08s: really quick but I also Imagine no
3309.48s: that's not that's not to profitability
3311.32s: that's just to
3313.08s: engagement right yeah and that makes
3315.64s: sense to me because the other thing I
3317.04s: find anyways is just a a difference now
3319.80s: with people and how much what what guard
3322.88s: rails are expected right I find people
3325.08s: in my generation and younger they like
3328.00s: that there's a lot of guard rails that
3330.20s: kind of are expected whereas my my guess
3333.08s: is the way you analyze it is probably
3334.92s: people making a concerted effort and
3336.96s: actually like truly applying themselves
3339.00s: which yeah I I could see yeah I mean if
3341.12s: you're talking about like just Stock
3343.00s: Investing you know I mean that there's
3345.76s: nothing to that that's a monkey can do
3347.64s: that and if you're talking about like if
3349.64s: you're talking about like you know
3351.88s: digital asset like Bitcoin or eth
3353.88s: investing or you know cryptocurrencies I
3356.44s: mean that's again that's also brain dead
3359.40s: stuff there's nothing to it you know
3360.92s: it's like you choose what you want to
3362.56s: buy and you buy it you hope it goes
3363.68s: higher I you're not there's no nothing
3365.44s: rocket science about that we're talking
3367.64s: about a much more complex game of you
3370.28s: know options and derivatives and and I
3373.16s: mean now if you were doing like you know
3375.40s: um if you were doing you know crypto
3377.28s: swaps if you're you know if you're doing
3379.04s: crypto swaps and and things like that
3381.44s: you know that's that's a whole different
3382.80s: game you know if you're if you're
3384.24s: staking and you're doing you know just
3386.52s: into the more complex aspects of the
3388.24s: business you know that you takes a
3390.16s: little bit longer to figure everything
3391.48s: out um if you're just buying stocks okay
3394.96s: great um if you're buying stock selling
3396.88s: calls against it or you know selling
3399.16s: stock selling puts or doing something
3401.48s: you know shorting puts to get long stock
3403.72s: you know all that stuff's way more you
3406.12s: know takes a little bit longer and then
3407.48s: when you get into option strategies it
3409.40s: takes a little bit longer I see what
3412.72s: strategies would you focus on like would
3414.96s: you focus somebody on for their first
3417.52s: you know 45 days cycle and maybe like
3419.56s: the first three six months it depends on
3422.36s: you know on a it depends on the amount
3424.52s: of capital you have I mean if it's
3425.60s: somebody with a reasonable amount of
3427.12s: capital and they they're comfortable
3428.88s: with covered calls or cash secured puts
3430.92s: or short puts I mean that's where I
3433.04s: would start because I like the high
3434.96s: probability of success in many of those
3436.68s: cases you know a short out- of-the money
3438.64s: put has you know up to an 80%
3440.48s: probability profit I like that um
3442.88s: covered call maybe 65 to 67% probability
3446.00s: profit Prof I like that um if you want
3448.64s: to do a vertical spread that would be
3450.72s: for the people that have less Capital
3452.64s: you know risk to find Credit spread or
3454.52s: debit spread um lower probability of
3456.92s: profit maybe it's 5050 maybe it's you
3459.92s: know 6040 um but a good way to get your
3463.08s: feet wet you know it just depends on
3465.24s: your Capital you know the amount of
3467.04s: capital you have unfortunately in the
3468.24s: trading World Capital does matter of
3471.56s: course and what would you say minimum
3474.76s: starting Capital versus optimal starting
3478.32s: Capital optimal starting Capital would
3480.64s: be $25,000 plus I mean optimal would be
3484.04s: 100 but you know 50 to 100 in that range
3487.00s: decent size account um minimum 25 in for
3491.40s: in the optimal World minimum 25 so you
3493.24s: don't have to deal with pattern day
3494.12s: trading rules um but any amount like if
3497.92s: you're 21 years old and you starting
3500.36s: with you know $2,000 you need 2,000
3503.48s: because that's the minimum for have a
3505.60s: margin account to allow you to do
3506.96s: complex spreads um but even if you have
3510.04s: $2,000 um that's totally great to get
3513.08s: started with I mean most people that
3515.64s: have $2,000 to trade with also have
3517.32s: $2,000 to go to Vegas with and your
3519.56s: chances of learning a lot more through
3521.36s: trading than going to Vegas is about is
3523.36s: about a you know 10x so yeah I'm pretty
3527.44s: confident that with
3528.60s: $2,000 you might not make money but
3530.88s: you're going to learn a crap load and
3533.08s: you're going to
3534.24s: be infinitely better better off as in
3537.88s: every aspect of your life so it sounds
3540.80s: like and I love that you make that
3542.52s: distinction it sounds like what you're
3544.96s: messaging there is if you're starting
3546.72s: with a really small amount of money
3548.00s: $2,000 in this case focus on what you're
3550.68s: learning not necessarily turning this
3552.96s: 2,000 into 200,000 I mean people have
3555.52s: this crazy you know you have this this
3559.60s: idea that you know somewhere someplace
3562.92s: one time somebody turned $2,000 into
3566.48s: 100,000 into a million into 10 million
3568.64s: whatever okay that's you know somebody
3571.04s: also bought a lottery ticket for $5 you
3573.28s: know bought a hand put 10 lottery
3575.00s: tickets for $5 or or five lottery
3576.92s: tickets for $ five and ended up winning
3579.12s: you know a couple hundred million yeah
3580.76s: sure it's happened but or or bought
3583.20s: seats next to Jordan Courtside that too
3585.88s: yeah whatever right well that was more
3587.76s: calculated we call that strategic um but
3591.56s: the reality is that that you know what
3594.52s: you'd like to do with $2,000 is you know
3597.24s: ideally is to turn it into
3599.28s: $3,000 and in the same time learn
3602.84s: everything there is to know so that when
3604.84s: you start to acquire wealth you you have
3607.64s: all the optionality in your
3609.80s: fingertips right last question before we
3612.40s: wrap up how do you guide people to make
3615.68s: that kind of Distinction in their mind
3618.32s: because I think most people that start
3620.12s: with a small amount of money their
3622.16s: expectation is they're going to turn it
3623.76s: into a large amount of money so then
3625.24s: when they hear something like that where
3627.24s: it's uh focus on the learning they're
3629.28s: probably like yeah whatever bro I'm just
3631.36s: going to turn this into a lot of money
3632.72s: how yeah sure I mean you know that's the
3636.28s: that's the gambler's dream you know I
3638.16s: mean there's so many people that go to
3640.28s: Vegas that think they're gonna go there
3641.68s: with ,000 and turn it into 10,000 but
3644.60s: you know most those people usually end
3646.16s: up walking to the
3647.88s: airport I mean you know that's the you
3652.08s: that that that's when you see somebody
3653.80s: walking to McCarron and they're on the
3656.12s: side of the road and they're walking
3657.96s: it's hot out and you're like oh man I I
3661.32s: can I I've seen that movie before um I
3666.20s: you know I'm a realist and you know I've
3670.24s: been around this business a long time
3672.04s: talked to literally millions of people
3674.76s: and traded my entire adult life from 20
3678.40s: you know from 40 some OD years I haven't
3680.96s: stopped trading um like I said I made
3683.16s: like 125 trades today I don't I'm a
3686.40s: junkie and it I I don't have any of
3689.64s: these crazy ideas that you know I'm
3692.56s: supposed to do like I'm supposed to turn
3695.76s: this amount of money into this amount of
3697.16s: money you know I just like it every time
3699.04s: I make a winning trade I don't care
3700.68s: today if it's a dollar or $100,000 I
3703.56s: still love making winning
3705.24s: trades that's awesome Tom I always enjoy
3708.88s: chatting with you it's it's really cool
3710.48s: thanks for sharing a lot of just other
3712.48s: stories it's really fun hearing more
3715.28s: about the stuff you've done it's very
3717.28s: cool most of us won't have that
3718.96s: experience so thank you for sharing with
3720.44s: us thank you for hanging out I'll
