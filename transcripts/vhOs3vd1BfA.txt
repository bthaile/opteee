0.00s:  Trading the wheel for income. We just had a great conversation about that on a live stream. You should check them out
6.16s:  We stream daily, but I want to walk you through an actual practical example of this and why there is some really important nuances
14.00s:  You have to be aware of if you think you're going to trade the wheel for income, especially in some index spy
20.88s:  Now one of the big issues people have with the wheel is it sounds so good
24.64s:  It sounds like a win-win-win-win, right? You so cash secured puts you get assigned at a cheaper basis
29.52s:  You collect premium to do it you sell calls collect premium against the shares that you hold and then you hold shares that appreciate and value
35.28s:  It sounds great across the board and I am actually an advocate of a very close cousin to the wheel that I think is far superior
43.52s:  Which is a covered strangle some slight nuances between them
47.04s:  I'll throw a link in the notes below that walk through that strategy and why I really prefer it over the wheel
54.00s:  But they're not that far apart now
56.96s:  The main thing is when we approach trading we have to approach it with our eyes wide open
63.52s:  That means we can't focus just on the elements that sound good or the pieces that we like
69.52s:  We have to walk through the reality of what it can look like
74.08s:  In general the markets look good the exhibit positive drift and that's awesome
78.40s:  You can make money holding index ETFs
81.20s:  But if we look at a year like 2022 it can go through periods that don't look as good
86.16s:  So if you're thinking that you're going to trade something like this for income and it's just going to be smooth sailing no problems
92.32s:  You're in for a really really really upsetting video
96.48s:  But it's a reality that you have to see
99.44s:  Because if you go into this with such a skewed perception and then you start seeing things going awry
105.68s:  That's typically when our strategies unravel and we make bad decisions and we're not in a good spot for it
112.40s:  So we can proactively think through then how we intend to manage this sort of thing
117.76s:  Based on what the market does so let's start with the wheel
123.04s:  So first things first I'm going to grab
126.24s:  The tracker here. This is just like a scratch tracker
128.96s:  We don't really need the short put side because the wheel typically starts with cash secure puts until you're assigned
134.88s:  And once we get assigned we'll just have our
138.96s:  shares so i'm going to use the current price of s&p 500 is 457 53 and this is starting the study on 10 Jan 2022
149.92s:  10 Jan 22 just for reference
152.88s:  So let's now go through and take a look at what this whole thing ends up being i'm adding another cell down here
161.12s:  Which helps me track the
163.12s:  Performance as we move along and then as we compare it to current spot price
167.60s:  This is using a perspective 100,000 dollar allocation
170.80s:  So the first step in our process is to sell cash secure puts until we're assigned and we have 100,000 dollars to do so
177.84s:  So let's go in here and
180.08s:  Let's find we'll just start with like a 30 delta something really really simple
184.24s:  We'll collect 714 because the market is already falling very very volatile
189.68s:  And let's figure out how many of these we can sell there's
194.08s:  $443 is the strike price so that tells us if we sell two of them
199.52s:  We're essentially going to be using 88 6 so that's pretty much what we're going to end up doing here
205.92s:  So right now it's 18 feb 22 the stock at entry as we've already identified 457 53
214.16s:  The expiration date is going to be 18 feb 22
218.16s:  The strike price that we're looking at is the
222.88s:  43 i'm just moving this out of the way so that i can go a little bit faster
226.40s:  443 the delta is point three the premium that we're going to get is 714
232.56s:  And it looks like we can sell two of them because we're going to use 88.6%
238.64s:  Of the portfolio at that point just to show you what this all looks like with things
243.20s:  We're tying up 88 6 we're going to collect
246.88s:  14 28 we're going to achieve a 1.6% return on invested capital
252.80s:  for a pretty short term trade
257.28s:  this
258.96s:  Is wrong obviously like i said this should be 10 Jan 22
263.36s:  And then this column is going to be completely rune because it's using
267.60s:  Today as compared to so not a bad return on invested capital for a 30 day trade
272.56s:  If we annualize that that's really healthy. So let's fast forward
275.92s:  I'm going to take a straight to expiration just so that we can move through this a little more efficiently
280.88s:  So we need to go to 18 feb
283.20s:  And let's see where we're at for these
286.32s:  I normally use the chart because it populates faster
289.20s:  This is using think or swim on demand it lets us go back and trade back in time as things were
294.80s:  So we can see that the market here looks like it's trading around 435
299.20s:  Our strike is 443 so we should be able to take this down for a full profit up here
304.08s:  You can't see it, but it says pre buffering it's done now and
308.08s:  that looks
309.92s:  like
311.28s:  Not the case
313.12s:  Because i mixed up my numbers so our strike is 443 not 435
318.64s:  So yeah our strike is 443 the stock is trading at 435 so in this case we essentially would just take assignment
325.04s:  So this closing price would be zero
328.88s:  The stock at exit right now is 435
333.20s:  like this
334.48s:  And now
336.40s:  Let's add the shares
338.88s:  So to do that we take this down because we do realize that entire profit which is great
345.76s:  We're done on the call side and now on today which is the expiration day of 18 feb 22
354.72s:  18 feb
356.80s:  22 we're going to buy to open 200 of these and then our basis was
362.24s:  The strike price which is 443
366.24s:  So now you can see up at the top here we're in for 200 shares. I had a basis of 443 total cost of
374.16s:  1860 so as the underlying sits right now at 435
380.48s:  You can see that the P&L on the stock is negative
383.60s:  1600 bucks so we're net negative including the premium received
387.92s:  And now is when we would look to try to sell some calls
391.12s:  So let's do that as part of the wheel
393.92s:  So let's go out 28 days to the next primary expiration
397.92s:  Our basis is 443 so we can easily sell stuff above our basis
402.64s:  So we'll just default to like a 30 delta here
406.00s:  And we can sell two of these
409.44s:  So i'm going to input this into the sheet and then i'll show you after it's done
412.48s:  So 15 feb 22 current stock price is 435 the expiration date is 18 March the strike price that we're looking at here is 449
421.44s:  The delta is a point three the premium that we're going to get is
424.96s:  455 and we can do two of these we have a two law
429.28s:  So
432.32s:  This is what we're looking at now again the reason why
436.88s:  This looks all messed up for like the return on invested capital
442.00s:  And then the P&L for the return on invested capital is just because of the dates. We're missing a days in trade
448.32s:  So don't worry about that that has everything to do with using historic dates
453.20s:  So now we fast forward and we see how we did
456.08s:  So let's do that we're going to go from 18 feb and we're going to go straight to the expiration of March which is 18 March
464.08s:  So let's see
465.68s:  How these two calls did it doesn't matter to it just that here just tracking it for our use
471.36s:  and convenience
473.28s:  And it looks like this stock is trading at 437 here our strike would be 449 so we should be in the clear
481.44s:  This should show us a whole profit. Yep, so these come down for a penny
486.24s:  I'll just say that we choose to exit it a little bit early just so that we don't have
493.52s:  Anything lingering and we can add more over the weekend. That's the more important part
498.40s:  Because if you take it all the way to expiration and allow it to expire that's fine, but then you
505.92s:  Don't have the opportunity to lay them out again over the weekend, which is suboptimal
512.80s:  So here's our trade from the call perspective we'll take this down
517.04s:  This will go into our little call section down here. This is nothing we can clear that out
522.56s:  And let's take a look at the trade as it sits so the stock is currently trading at 439
528.56s:  So
529.60s:  If we had bought outright at 457 we would be down
534.80s:  4.1 percent
536.88s:  But our position is actually up just a little bit, which is really cool. That's one of the benefits of
544.56s:  Trading something like the wheel where we can have satellite positions like these puts like these calls
550.24s:  Make a little bit of money as we move along. So let's continue the experiment
556.24s:  Today's date in the thing is 18 March 22
559.76s:  And then the stock at entry will be the same as the stock is exit for the last position
565.60s:  And I'll move this out of the way. So again, I can go a little quicker
569.12s:  And let's go out here to 14 april. We'll do 14 april
572.80s:  22
574.80s:  Let's see if we can get another 30 delta that's above our basis. We can so this is 452 our basis is 443
581.52s:  So let's find
582.96s:  For strike price is going to be that 452 delta is 0.3 again the premium we're going to get is 4.1
590.48s:  Lot size will be 2
592.48s:  and
593.28s:  Let's
594.80s:  Forward
596.24s:  Now one of the reasons why I'm taking you through the fast forwarding and everything so that you literally can see
601.36s:  How to do this for yourself
604.24s:  Because the ability to run through and test ideas like this is massive
608.80s:  It helps so much with developing a better understanding of how things look
616.08s:  During different market conditions how we might manage things and there's also a reason why I insist
621.20s:  Unusing a manual input process
623.36s:  I used to have everything fully automated and then I realized that by fully automating stuff
628.72s:  You become a little more detached from it and more detached than I cared to be so this will come down for a penny
635.12s:  Which is great
637.28s:  Underlying is currently trading at 441.8
641.12s:  441.8
644.08s:  Let's move this trade down here
647.28s:  So now from the call side we've realized
649.76s:  1700 bucks from the put side we've realized 14
653.60s:  28 and with the stock at 441.8
659.20s:  We are showing a stock loss unrealized of 240
663.44s:  So we are now in the black officially showing a profit so 14 april
670.00s:  14 april 22
673.28s:  Now let's get our next series or short calls out
677.28s:  This will take us to 20 May
681.84s:  22
683.04s:  Strike price again. Let's see if we can get that 30 delta we should be able to that's above our basis 455
688.48s:  That's great
689.68s:  So our strike price in this case will be 455 which is again a 30 delta premium that we're going to take in is 364
696.32s:  We'll have another two lot that goes out
698.96s:  And you know what's next we go on fast forward. Let's go now to 20 May next expiration
706.00s:  And let's see how we do
709.44s:  So now it looks like the stock is dropping pretty heavy. It's down to
713.44s:  397.98 on here
715.92s:  So this is going to look fine
718.80s:  This will essentially be able to come down for a full profit
721.84s:  But the underlying position is going to look a little bit unhealthy
726.80s:  so we can see
729.20s:  This is essentially we would take that down for a penny or zero just let it expire
735.52s:  Let's take it down for a penny so that we can try to add something else out there
738.96s:  And then the current underlying is 387
742.08s:  Let's take a look at 387
744.56s:  And let's drop this
748.00s:  Down here for the call side of things
750.88s:  Because I copy this over from another the formatting gets a little messed up
754.72s:  But we can fix it just like that
756.88s:  And
757.92s:  Now let's update the price for what it is which is 37
761.68s:  So now the stock is showing an $11,200 unrealized loss
765.76s:  So we are now very very clearly losing money. Let's go to 20 May
771.12s:  22 which will be our entry date at 387
775.92s:  And then let's see what we can find
778.56s:  There's a potential that we might not be able to find anything within a reasonable amount of time. Let's try 28 days first
784.96s:  Our basis is 443
787.20s:  So you can see as we go out to something above our basis
790.08s:  We essentially collect like 15 cents so you have a choice here
793.12s:  You can either sell below your basis and plan to manage it
796.16s:  Or you can accept that you're not really going to collect a bunch of money
799.12s:  Or you can go further out in time. Those are your series of choices
802.96s:  So let's see what the 443s will get you out here
806.48s:  Which is 5657
809.68s:  It's not a lot not a lot at all
812.00s:  Here's how I do it
813.44s:  My preference is if I'm going to sell below my basis
816.08s:  I'm going to be much closer in time
818.08s:  If I'm going to sell at my basis
820.32s:  And there's not a lot in it. I'm going to be much closer in time
824.00s:  The reason is because I want to maintain as much spot price sensitivity
827.76s:  As compared to getting stock with the long expiration
830.72s:  And then if the stock starts moving up, I'm kind of stock. I don't really want that
835.52s:  So let's go here and let's just pretend we're going to keep it at our basis
839.92s:  Following like the standard approach a lot of people do
842.64s:  There's a more advanced version of this of selling below the basis
845.44s:  Which is what I would do if you guys are interested in that
848.40s:  Let me know we can do a video on it at some point
851.36s:  That's something that we've done a couple focus topics on for the patreon
856.64s:  Because it is a little bit nuanced, but it's very doable
859.52s:  So now let's take a look at a strike price of 443
862.48s:  Our delta is going to be quite low of a .02
868.32s:  Premium 14 cents lots to
871.44s:  So let's fast forward one more time
875.04s:  And then I just want to show you
877.52s:  What's going on here with the wheel in this scenario
882.80s:  We got to go to 17 June, which is here
886.16s:  And I want to talk about a couple ways to enhance what's going on
889.68s:  If you find yourself in this scenario because now the stock is plummeting even more
894.08s:  Down to 362
895.76s:  So let's see what this shows up at
899.52s:  We should be in a pretty healthy spot in terms of the calls being essentially worthless
904.32s:  So we can start actually filling that in
906.96s:  I'm pretty sure there'll be like a penny minus point on just call it that
911.20s:  And let's see what the underlying itself is trading at
916.24s:  Yeah, so it's essentially a penny and the underlying now is at
920.80s:  364. So let's grab that workbook again
924.40s:  364
927.20s:  So we essentially made 26 bucks there
931.04s:  Not much to write home about it's something
934.16s:  And the underlying itself right now is at 364
939.44s:  So let's update this 364
941.44s:  So we are we are deep deep in we're down 15,000
946.72s:  So if we had a hundred thousand dollars allocated to this trade
949.52s:  This might be a good time to kind of use the rest of it now my general approach is a little more nuanced
954.64s:  I would scale in in different time frames and whatnot
957.68s:  But let's just say that we're going to come in at 364 11
962.16s:  And the purpose of doing this is to help reduce our basis a little bit
965.68s:  We have the ability to use what a little under
969.84s:  Well a little over 10k so let's take a look at starting with like a 50 lot
974.32s:  Not quite let's do like a 30 lot
976.96s:  That's closer maybe 35 lot
980.24s:  Just too much so we'll keep it at like a 30 lot we'll use 99,523
985.36s:  So that now reduces our basis to 432 a pretty meaningful basis adjustment all things considered
991.52s:  However, if we take a look and we go out 28 days we go to that 432
996.32s:  You're now only making like 10 cents you just not making one
1001.04s:  So this is one of the limitations of trading the wheel for income income specifically
1008.00s:  Because if your approach is to trade this for income
1011.92s:  If we take a look at the overall duration that we're into this whole thing we started on 19 Jan
1017.20s:  22 the date that we're at in here is 17 June we're about halfway through the year and our overall P&L is
1026.24s:  Much better than if we had just bought outright. It's about half
1029.92s:  But you're still down 12% that's still not good. That's not good enough
1034.32s:  And this is one of the reasons why I like the coverage strangles so much more than this is because we use calls inputs as satellite positions around
1043.52s:  The underlying itself and we get much better adjustments out of it
1047.60s:  But the main issue with this idea of trading something like spy via the wheel for income is that if you go through periods like this
1055.20s:  You have to have another approach
1057.20s:  Otherwise you just you don't really have income coming in once we get into this right so like the last
1063.84s:  Couple short calls that we traded we made 26 dollars on those and we just
1070.08s:  Don't have a lot to show for the risk that we're putting out and I think what did we get on these up here?
1077.76s:  Yeah, the 26 bucks
1080.64s:  so
1081.92s:  Here's a couple things to keep in mind if we're trading the wheel for income the first thing that you can do is the biggest favor
1087.84s:  To yourself is don't use the income for the same month or even the same year
1092.48s:  My advice is if you're trading for income essentially pad at least one full year of your required income
1099.20s:  That's padded meaning you give it a buffer
1101.52s:  So that this way as we're going through a negative period like this
1105.28s:  We can stomach it the fact that we're only taking 26 dollars in wouldn't be sufficient for income
1110.88s:  But if I'm able to trade other things at the same time
1113.84s:  I'm doing this to take advantage of the current market conditions
1116.56s:  And then eventually this recovers and start to show a profit that compensates for the loss
1121.04s:  Then that pluses back up where I need to be for my
1126.16s:  12 month
1127.36s:  Buffer of income I actually would do no less than 24 months two years personally
1132.80s:  The market can have for a long down periods and this is one of them if we continue this exercise
1137.68s:  It's the same thing for the next six months. You're just not able to collect much
1141.60s:  We've used all the money. So now it's sitting and waiting which can be problematic
1146.00s:  So this is not to disparage the wheel or using this as a way to make money or to make income
1153.52s:  It's just to make sure that we're going into this with eyes wide open
1156.96s:  As always if you have any questions let me know if you're in the patreon you have access to templates for stuff like
1163.36s:  If not just literally recreate what you see here if you don't have an idea of where to start
1168.32s:  I recommend at least something like this. This is a super simple one being outlier. I will see you all later
