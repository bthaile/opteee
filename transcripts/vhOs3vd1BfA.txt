0.00s: Trading the wheel for income. We just had a great conversation about that on a live stream. You should check them out
6.16s: We stream daily, but I want to walk you through an actual practical example of this and why there is some really important nuances
14.00s: You have to be aware of if you think you're going to trade the wheel for income, especially in some index spy
20.88s: Now one of the big issues people have with the wheel is it sounds so good
24.64s: It sounds like a win-win-win-win, right? You so cash secured puts you get assigned at a cheaper basis
29.52s: You collect premium to do it you sell calls collect premium against the shares that you hold and then you hold shares that appreciate and value
35.28s: It sounds great across the board and I am actually an advocate of a very close cousin to the wheel that I think is far superior
43.52s: Which is a covered strangle some slight nuances between them
47.04s: I'll throw a link in the notes below that walk through that strategy and why I really prefer it over the wheel
54.00s: But they're not that far apart
56.00s: Now the main thing is when we approach trading we have to approach it with our eyes wide open
63.52s: That means we can't focus just on the elements that sound good or the pieces that we like
69.52s: We have to walk through the reality of what it can look like
74.16s: In general the markets look good the exhibit positive drift and that's awesome
78.40s: You can make money holding index ETFs
81.20s: But if we look at a year like 2022 it can go through periods that don't look as good
86.16s: So if you're thinking that you're going to trade something like this for income
89.68s: And it's just going to be smooth sailing no problems
92.32s: You're in for a really really really upsetting video
96.48s: But it's a reality that you have to see
99.44s: Because if you go into this with such a skewed perception and then you start seeing things going awry
105.68s: That's typically when our strategies unravel and we make bad decisions and we're not in a good spot for it
112.40s: So we can proactively think through then how we intend to manage this sort of thing
117.76s: Based on what the market does so let's start with the wheel
123.04s: So first things first i'm going to grab
126.24s: The tracker here. This is just like a scratch tracker
128.96s: We don't really need the short put side because the wheel typically starts with cash secure puts until you're assigned
134.88s: And once we get assigned we'll just have our
138.96s: shares so i'm going to use the current price of s&p 500 is 457 53
145.68s: And this is starting the study on 10 Jan 2022
149.92s: 10 Jan 22 just for reference
152.88s: So let's now go through and take a look at what this whole thing ends up being
159.04s: I'm adding another cell down here which helps me track
162.72s: The performance as we move along and then as we compare it to current spot price
167.60s: This is using a perspective 100,000 dollar allocation
170.80s: So the first step in our process is to sell cash secure puts until we're assigned and we have 100,000 dollars to do so
177.84s: So let's go in here and
180.08s: Let's find we'll just start with like a 30 delta something really really simple
184.24s: We'll collect 714 because the market is already falling very very volatile
189.68s: And let's figure out how many of these we can sell there's
193.84s: 443 dollars is the strike price so that tells us if we sell two of them
199.52s: We're essentially going to be using 88 6 so that's pretty much
204.56s: What we're going to end up doing here. So right now it's 18 feb 22
208.00s: The stock at entry as we've already identified 457 53
214.24s: The expiration date is going to be 18 feb 22
218.24s: The strike price that we're looking at is the
221.92s: 443 i'm just moving this out of the way so that I can go a little bit faster
226.40s: 443 the delta is 0.3 the premium that we're going to get is 714
232.56s: And it looks like we can sell two of them because we're going to use 88.6%
238.64s: Of the portfolio at that point just to show you what this all looks like with things input. We're tying up 88 6
245.44s: We're going to collect
246.96s: 1428 we're going to achieve a 1.6% return on invested capital
252.80s: for a pretty short term trade
257.28s: this
259.04s: Is wrong obviously like I said this should be 10 Jan 22
263.36s: And then this column is going to be completely rune because it's using
267.60s: Today as compared to so not a bad return on invested capital for a 30 day trade if we annualize that that's really healthy
274.64s: So let's fast forward. I'm going to take a straight to expiration just so that we can move through this a little more efficiently
280.88s: So we need to go to 18 feb
283.20s: And let's see where we're at for these
286.24s: I normally use the chart because it populates faster
289.20s: This is using think or swim on demand it lets us go back and trade back in time as things were
294.80s: So we can see that the market here looks like it's trading around 435
299.20s: Our strike is 443 so we should be able to take this down for a full profit
303.52s: Up here you can't see it, but it says pre buffering. It's done now and
308.08s: that looks
311.12s: Not the case
313.12s: Because I mixed up my numbers. So our strike is 443 not 435
318.64s: So yeah, our strike is 443 the stock is trading at 435 so in this case we essentially would just take assignment
325.04s: So this closing price would be 0
328.88s: The stock at exit right now is 435
333.20s: like this
334.56s: And now let's add the shares
338.88s: So to do that we take this down because we do realize that entire profit which is great
345.76s: We're done on the call side and now on today, which is the expiration day of 18 feb 22
354.72s: 18 feb
356.80s: 22 we're going to buy to open 200 of these and then our basis was
362.24s: The strike price, which is 443
366.24s: So now you can see up at the top here. We're in for 200 shares. I had a basis of 443 total cost of
374.16s: 1860
375.20s: so as the underlying sits right now at 435
380.48s: You can see that the P&L on the stock is negative 1600 bucks
384.56s: So we're net negative including the premium received
387.92s: And now is when we would look to try to sell some calls. So let's do that as part of the wheel
393.92s: So let's go out 28 days to the next primary expiration
397.92s: Our basis is 443 so we can easily sell stuff above our basis
402.64s: So we'll just default to like a 30 delta here
406.00s: And
406.96s: We can sell two of these so I'm going to input this into the sheet and then I'll show you after it's done
412.40s: So 15 feb 22 current stock prices 435
415.84s: The expiration date is 18 March the strike price that we're looking at here is 449
421.44s: The delta is a point three the premium that we're going to get is 455 and we can do two of these we have a two law
429.28s: so
432.32s: This is what we're looking at now again the reason why
436.88s: This looks all messed up for like the return on invested capital and then the P&L for the return on invested capital
445.52s: It's just because of the dates. We're missing a days in trade
448.32s: So don't worry about that that has everything to do with using historic dates
453.20s: So now we fast forward and we see how we did
456.08s: So let's do that we're going to go from 18 feb and we're going to go straight to the expiration of March which is 18 March
464.08s: So let's see
465.76s: How these two calls did it doesn't matter to it just that here just tracking it for our use and convenience
473.12s: And it looks like this stock is trading at 437 here our strike would be 449 so we should be in the clear
481.44s: This should show us a whole profit. Yep, so these come down for a penny
486.24s: I'll just say that we choose to exit it a little bit early just so that we don't have
493.52s: Anything lingering and we can add more over the weekend. That's the more important part
498.40s: Because if you take it all the way to expiration and allow it to expire that's fine, but then you
505.92s: Don't have the opportunity to lay them out again over the weekend, which is suboptimal
512.80s: So here's our trade from the call perspective. We'll take this down
517.04s: This will go into our little call section down here. This is nothing we can clear that out
522.56s: And let's take a look at the trade as it sits so the stock is currently trading at 439
528.56s: So
529.60s: If we had bought outright at 457 we would be down
534.80s: 4.1 percent
536.88s: But our position is actually up just a little bit, which is really cool. That's one of the benefits of
544.56s: Trading something like the wheel where we can have satellite positions like these puts like these calls
550.24s: Make a little bit of money as we move along. So let's continue the experiment
556.24s: Today's date in the thing is 18 March 22
559.76s: And then the stock at entry will be the same as the stock is exit for the last position
565.60s: And I'll move this out of the way. So again, I can go a little quicker
569.12s: And let's go out here to 14 April we'll do 14 April 22
574.80s: Let's see if we can get another 30 delta that's above our basis. We can so this is 452 our basis is 443
581.52s: So let's find
582.96s: For strike price is going to be that 452 delta is 0.3 again the premium we're going to get is 4.1
590.48s: Lot size will be 2
592.48s: and
593.28s: Let's
594.80s: Forward
596.24s: Now one of the reasons why I'm taking you through the fast forwarding and everything so that you literally can see
601.36s: How to do this for yourself
604.24s: Because the ability to run through and test ideas like this is massive
608.80s: It helps so much with developing a better understanding of how things look
616.08s: During different market conditions how we might manage things and there's also a reason why I insist
621.20s: Unusing a manual input process
623.36s: I used to have everything fully automated and then I realized that by fully automating stuff
628.72s: You become a little more detached from it and more detached than I cared to be so this will come down for a penny
635.12s: Which is great
636.48s: The underlying is currently trading at 441.8
641.12s: 441.8
644.08s: Let's move this trade down here
647.36s: So now from the call side we've realized
649.76s: 1700 bucks from the put side we've realized 14
653.68s: 28 and with the stock at 441.8
659.20s: We are showing a stock loss unrealized of 240
663.44s: So we are now in the black officially showing a profit so 14 april
670.00s: 14 april 22
673.28s: Now let's get our next series or short calls out
677.28s: This will take us to 20 May
681.84s: 22
683.04s: Strike price again. Let's see if we can get that 30 delta we should be able to that's above our basis 455
688.48s: That's great
689.68s: So our strike price in this case will be 455 which is again a 30 delta premium that we're going to take in is 364
696.32s: We'll have another two lot that goes out
698.96s: And you know what's next we going fast forward. Let's go now to 20 May next expiration
706.00s: And let's see how we do
709.44s: So now it looks like the stock is dropping pretty heavy. It's down to
713.44s: 397.98 on here
715.92s: So this is going to look fine
718.80s: This will essentially be able to come down for a full profit
721.84s: But the underlying position is going to look a little bit unhealthy
726.80s: so we can see
729.20s: This is essentially we would take that down for a penny or zero just let it expire
735.52s: Let's take it down for a penny so that we can try to add something else out there
738.96s: And then the current underlying is 387
742.08s: Let's take a look at 387
744.56s: And let's drop this
748.00s: Down here for the call side of things
750.88s: Because I copy this over from another the formatting gets a little messed up
754.72s: But we can fix it just like that
756.88s: And
757.92s: Now let's update the price for what it is which is 37
761.68s: So now the stock is showing an $11,200 unrealized loss
765.76s: So we are now very very clearly losing money. Let's go to 20 May
771.12s: 22 which will be our entry date at 387
775.92s: And then let's see what we can find
778.56s: There is a potential that we might not be able to find anything within a reasonable amount of time
783.04s: Let's try 28 days first
784.88s: Our basis is 443
787.20s: So you can see as we go out to something above our basis
790.08s: We essentially collect like 15 cents so you have a choice here
793.12s: You can either sell below your basis and plan to manage it
796.16s: Or you can accept that you're not really going to collect a bunch of money
799.12s: Or you can go further out in time those are your series of choices
802.96s: So let's see what the 443s will get you out here
806.48s: Which is 5657
809.52s: It's not a lot not a lot at all
811.92s: Here's how I do it
813.44s: My preference is if I'm going to sell below my basis
816.08s: I'm going to be much closer in time
818.08s: If I'm going to sell at my basis
820.24s: And there's not a lot in it
821.68s: I'm going to be much closer in time
823.68s: The reason is because I want to maintain as much spot price sensitivity
827.76s: As compared to getting stock with a long expiration
830.80s: And then if the stock starts moving up
832.72s: I'm kind of stock
833.92s: I don't really want that
835.52s: So let's go here and let's just pretend we're going to keep it at our basis
840.00s: Following like the standard approach a lot of people do
842.72s: There's a more advanced version of this of selling below the basis
845.52s: Which is what I would do
847.04s: If you guys are interested in that
848.48s: Let me know we can do a video on it at some point
851.36s: That's something that we've done a couple of focus topics on for the patreon
856.64s: Because it is a little bit nuanced but it's very doable
859.52s: So now let's take a look at a strike price of $443
862.48s: Our delta is going to be quite low of a .02
868.32s: Premium $0.14 lots too
871.44s: So let's fast forward one more time
875.04s: And then I just want to show you
877.52s: What's going on here with the wheel in this scenario
882.72s: We got to go to 17 June which is here
886.08s: And I want to talk about a couple of ways to enhance what's going on
889.68s: If you find yourself in this scenario
891.28s: Because now the stock is plummeting even more
894.08s: Down to 362
895.76s: So let's see what this shows up at
899.52s: We should be in a pretty healthy spot in terms of the calls being essentially worthless
904.32s: So we can start actually filling that in
906.96s: I'm pretty sure there'll be like a penny minus point
909.12s: On just call it that
911.20s: And let's see what the underlying itself is trading at
916.24s: Yeah, so it's essentially a penny
917.92s: And the underlying now is at $364
921.60s: So let's grab that workbook again
924.40s: $364
927.20s: So we essentially made $26 there
931.12s: Not much to write home about
932.64s: It's something
934.16s: And the underlying itself right now
937.92s: Is at $364
939.44s: So let's update this 364
941.44s: So we are we are deep deep in
944.64s: We're down 15,000
946.80s: So if we had $100,000 allocated to this trade
949.52s: This might be a good time to kind of use the rest of it
952.16s: Now my general approach is a little more nuanced
954.56s: I would scale in in different time frames and whatnot
957.60s: But let's just say that we're going to come in at 364.11
962.08s: And the purpose of doing this is to help reduce our basis a little bit
965.60s: And we have the ability to use what a little under
969.84s: Well a little over 10k
971.04s: So let's take a look at starting with like a 50 lot
974.32s: Not quite let's do like a 30 lot
976.88s: That's closer maybe 35 lot
980.24s: Just too much so we'll keep it at like a 30 lot
982.72s: We'll use 99,523
985.36s: So that now reduces our basis to 432
988.08s: A pretty meaningful basis adjustment
990.16s: All things considered
991.44s: However
992.48s: If we take a look and we go out 28 days
994.48s: We go to that 432
996.32s: You're now only making like 10 cents
999.04s: You're just not making one
1001.04s: So this is one of the limitations of trading the wheel for income
1006.40s: Income specifically
1008.00s: Because if your approach is to trade this for income
1011.92s: If we take a look at the overall duration
1014.16s: That we're into this whole thing
1015.44s: We started on 19 Jan 22
1018.16s: The date that we're at in here is 17 June
1020.72s: We're about halfway through the year
1022.72s: And our overall PNL is much better
1027.44s: Than if we had just bought outright
1029.04s: It's about half
1030.00s: But you're still down 12%
1031.76s: That's still not good
1032.64s: That's not good enough
1034.24s: And this is one of the reasons why I like the coverage
1036.40s: Strangles so much more than this
1038.24s: Is because we use calls inputs
1040.80s: As satellite positions around the underlying itself
1044.72s: And we get much better adjustments out of it
1047.60s: But the main issue with this idea of trading
1050.56s: Something like Spivey of the wheel for income
1053.20s: Is that if you go through periods like this
1055.20s: You have to have another approach
1057.12s: Otherwise you just you don't really have income coming in
1060.80s: Once we get into this right so like
1062.72s: The last couple short calls that we traded
1065.60s: We made $26 on those
1067.84s: And we just
1070.08s: Don't have a lot
1071.68s: To show for the risk that we're putting out
1074.16s: And I think what did we get on these up here
1078.72s: Yeah the 26 bucks
1080.72s: So
1081.84s: Here's a couple things to keep in mind
1084.24s: If we're trading the wheel for income
1085.76s: The first thing that you can do is the biggest favor to yourself
1088.48s: Is don't use the income for the same month or even the same year
1092.48s: My advice is if you're trading for income
1094.96s: Essentially pad at least one full year of your required income
1099.20s: That's padded meaning you give it a buffer
1101.52s: So that this way as we're going through a negative period like this
1105.36s: We can stomach it
1106.72s: The fact that we're only taking $26 in
1109.12s: Wouldn't be sufficient for income
1110.88s: But if I'm able to trade other things
1113.04s: At the same time I'm doing this to take advantage of the current
1116.56s: And then eventually this recovers and start to show a profit
1119.12s: That compensates for the loss
1121.04s: Then that pluses back up where I need to be
1125.12s: For my 12 month buffer of income
1128.96s: I actually would do no less than 24 months
1131.92s: Two years personally
1132.80s: So the market can have
1134.16s: Pro long down periods
1135.36s: And this is one of them
1136.16s: If we continue this exercise
1137.76s: It's the same thing for the next six months
1139.84s: You're just not able to collect much
1141.60s: We've used all the money
1142.96s: So now it's sitting and waiting
1144.40s: Which can be problematic
1146.00s: So this is not to disparage the wheel
1149.76s: Or using this as a way to make money or to make income
1153.52s: It's just to make sure that we're going into this with eyes wide open
1156.96s: As always
1157.76s: If you have any questions
1158.96s: Let me know if you're in the Patreon
1160.56s: You have access to templates for stuff like this
1163.36s: If not just literally recreate what you see here
1166.56s: If you don't have an idea of where to start
1168.32s: I recommend at least something like this
1170.32s: This is a super simple one
1171.76s: Be an outlier
1172.64s: I will see you all later
