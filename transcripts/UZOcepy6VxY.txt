0.00s:  What's up everyone? Welcome back to the outlier podcast. I have a familiar face. Tom Baso coming
8.24s:  to hang out again. First off, happy birthday. Hey, it was a good day. I fixed an irrigation leak
15.92s:  in the backyard and I was flagged by that I couldn't figure out and I finally found the leak and
22.24s:  got to it and repaired the header and everything's working beautifully now. So
27.84s:  I love that. Happy day. I find a big part of home ownership is irrigation maintenance because
34.08s:  I literally have two little like hand carts, one upstairs, one downstairs, literally for fixing
41.60s:  irrigation, which I do all the time. So it sounds like it's a mutual experience because I forgot
47.20s:  you're up in the mountains. I am now. Yeah. I got two houses. We go down to the valley
54.64s:  in the Scottsdale area in North Scottsdale for the winter usually. But I'm going down this afternoon
60.56s:  because I'm meeting up with some family or coming in from the airport. So I get to go out to
66.08s:  dinner with everyone tonight. That's so awesome. I'm stoked. Well, you're looking great. You're
71.60s:  probably healthier than I am right now. That's telling you I got a pernated disk. So your boy is
76.96s:  I had a bulging disk that blew when I was, let's see, I would have been about 50 years old.
87.20s:  It finally ruptured and oh my gosh, bad pain. Yeah. But unfortunately I got one of those
94.72s:  fancy shots with the very long needles and surprisingly 15 minutes later after the shot,
101.92s:  I walked out completely normal and I haven't had any problem since.
105.68s:  Well, maybe I need to find that shot because mine's been going on for like two weeks and it's not been
110.56s:  super fun. So I'll have to look into it. But enough about my broken back. Let's talk about some
119.12s:  markets. So I figured a good place to start actually is with the recent sell-off that we had.
126.08s:  What do you make of that? We saw it kind of across the indices and yeah, what are your thoughts there?
131.44s:  Yeah, I just think it's we had a long time of a lot of upmove, a lot of
140.16s:  concentration of the money into things like NVIDIA. And I think what ended up happening is
146.64s:  everybody was sitting there, you know, having made some nice money and getting a little itchy
153.52s:  to take those profits. And I think when the things started falling in for any excuse,
159.04s:  it was like a match on a bunch of gasoline. It just, you know, a little sudden you had a firestorm.
167.20s:  And then now the the last week or so it's been trying to climb its way back out of the hole, but
174.08s:  boy today was one of the quietest days I've ever seen. I gave up and went and fixed irrigation.
180.56s:  It was a lot more interesting and I tied down some netting in the vegetable garden and did some pruning
188.00s:  and had a nice day outside. Took a shower, put on the uniform for the interview. And
194.80s:  yeah, it's been a nice relaxing day, but there was no point for me to be at my desk for sure.
201.52s:  Yeah, one of the things that I thought was interesting to your point, I felt very similar with
206.24s:  the sell-off. It felt like we had a very just one-sided move. It's hard to classify like what over
212.72s:  done is, but it just seemed like we were going up. And to me, when the market does that for long
218.08s:  enough to your point, I always get the sense that you kind of never know what's going to tilt it,
222.72s:  but something typically does. What I thought was interesting though was the series of gap
228.88s:  downs into kind of that really strong support day on the fifth where I mean, it had a pretty nasty
238.16s:  previous two days. So when you see the market take a bite on a day like the fifth,
244.88s:  what do you make of that? Do you think that's kind of just where the market is deciding this is a
248.56s:  value area? I like it here, sell-offs enough, or what do you think? Well, what I think actually is
256.00s:  a supply and demand of orders with a lot of computer power behind it means things are going to move
261.76s:  very fast and a lot of people are going to adjust their positions very, very quickly. And because
268.24s:  of the speed they can do that, I don't know that the support area to me at least would be magical
276.32s:  at all. I think it's just that everybody that wanted to take a profit or sell or get nervous or
284.08s:  do whatever they want to do had done it. So the selling kind of subsides a little bit and then
290.72s:  everybody starts looking at everybody and deciding do I want to be the hero that steps in and
296.32s:  starts making it go up again? And judging from the last week, they haven't been really excited about
302.96s:  that. They've been really, it's been very quiet and making new highs every day, but it's not very
311.44s:  much of a new high and the bars are getting skinny. Yeah, that's funny. I was actually,
318.72s:  that was my next question is I noticed for the first three to four days of kind of that, I don't
324.08s:  want to call it a V because it's not yet. I like L. But the first the first three or four days were
331.04s:  I thought kind of moving up, I thought semi-quickly, but then it seemed to really start slow down
338.32s:  and it sounds like from your opinion, it's been mostly slow across the board. So what do you think
344.64s:  of the buying behavior that you saw over the first few days compared to what it looks like now?
350.40s:  I would say the buying behavior hasn't been really strong in that boy, the selling was pretty
357.04s:  definitely panic mode. And so if this thing touches off again, you could have another
362.72s:  leg down and you could be into a full fledged bear market. And a lot of the traders that got their
368.40s:  stimulus checks back in 2000 when we had COVID and all that have been trading largely in
376.00s:  market. They have not seen a major bear like down 50 percent. It could get ugly and could get ugly
384.24s:  quickly and it could be take a real bite out of a lot of people's portfolios that they aren't
389.12s:  careful. The answer is just to simply think about what you're doing and have a plan.
395.12s:  I can head stuff, I can time out of things, I can go short on some of my strategies.
405.36s:  I'm not at all worried about a market sell off, it could be actually profitable, but
411.28s:  to not have a plan is to fail. Yeah, completely.
417.12s:  I hate to see that. What will end up happening is I have a big presence on Twitter and everything.
424.96s:  People DM me all the time. And unfortunately, a month or two into the next bear market whenever
432.00s:  it occurs. And if I'm still alive, we will get these DMs and say, some to Bob Mr. Baso.
442.80s:  I am a bi, I'm a long, only trader in stocks. And I noticed that you went to a down direction and
453.04s:  your portfolio, but I didn't do that. And now I'm down 25 percent. And I'm wondering if you could
461.60s:  advise me on what I should do now. I get those all the time. That question for you. What's the
467.76s:  response? What do you say to that? I usually start with, I don't know what to say. I kind of have
477.12s:  been warning people over and over and to have a plan. You didn't develop a plan. I also talked
482.64s:  about hedging your portfolio. You didn't hedge it. Now that the cat has left the building and is
490.80s:  wandering around the neighborhood, you want to know what you should do to keep your cat in.
497.28s:  You know, I don't, I don't know what to tell you. I'm developing a plan in Mexico.
502.00s:  You get it right the next time. Yeah, those two late now. I mean, people, and I get those all the
509.04s:  time right in the middle of big bear markets or bear moves, you know, the COVID crash for instance.
514.96s:  Everybody was panicking, so thoroughly panicking. And when they did that, they ended up
524.00s:  getting to the point where they were really losing a ton of money. And they ended up
535.20s:  asking me what to do. And I'm thinking, all right, let's see. You could start looking at whether or
540.96s:  not you want to buy or whatever get ready for the next cycle the other way. It's a little early
546.72s:  to do that because you're in the middle of the downswing, but you know, it's crazy. People just
552.24s:  think ahead. They'll have one way of thinking, one strategy and they, you know, and their
558.08s:  ten favorite stocks or something. And there's a whole world. I mean, there's thousands of
563.60s:  physicians out there that you could diversify into. I'm trading 35 futures markets now. I'm trading
570.56s:  multiple indicators, multiple time period rates. So, you know, in any, I look at a screen any one
577.92s:  day, I've got red and green on the screen. I just hope that the green is a little more than the red.
584.80s:  You just can't, you know, do one thing one way. If you're going to do that, you're going to have to
590.72s:  expect some severe drawdowns with no place to hide. You just can't avoid it. Yeah, part of
597.68s:  seems to be part of the game. Now, exploring that scenario a little further, let's pretend that
604.56s:  that person DMed you before the market dropped. And let's say it's a similar scenario though. Let's
611.12s:  say that there's still long only, which to me is kind of a big crutch because you miss a lot of
617.84s:  different things you can do, but keeping that same level set long only. When you're talking to them
624.40s:  about creating a plan, what kind of things would you tell them to take a look at with that plan?
629.12s:  The first thing I'd always ask is do you have stock losses on your positions? If you're buying hold
635.04s:  and you have no idea where you're going to get out of anything, you don't have a complete trading plan.
640.16s:  Think you should have an entry, you should have an exit, trailing stock of some sort. If you have
646.48s:  profit objectives and you're trying to limit your gains, not a big fan of that, but there's some
651.60s:  strategies where it makes some sense, I suppose. And if you're going to have that, put the limit order
657.76s:  in there and take your profit on part of your position or whatever you want to do, but have a total
662.88s:  plan. So it's the plan to get in, the plan to get out, plan to for your initial stop, any kind of
668.96s:  trailing stop and any kind of method of taking profit if there is going to be one. Then on top of that,
676.56s:  you got to have a plan for how to size your position. Number two, and that's sometimes more important
682.88s:  than I think the first things we talked about, all the buying and selling. Because if you
688.00s:  size something too much, you put yourself in harm's way. If you size yourself too small,
694.08s:  you might have a great return, but it won't affect your portfolio positively enough for you to
700.56s:  make the money you needed to make on that one to pay for the losers that are no doubt going to
704.96s:  be there too. So you've got to be in balance all the time and position sizing is so important with
710.40s:  that. Then the last thing is if you're going to be long only, can you try to stretch your portfolio
717.36s:  out somehow? Example, you could be long only in stocks, but you could then also look at being
726.00s:  long only in corn. In corn and stocks don't have anything to do with each other, so they're going to
731.36s:  go up and down a different times. And I'll add to that things like gold, things like industrial
737.12s:  models, things like energy contracts, things like meats, things like softs like cocoa and orange
745.76s:  use. Cocoa is had a really good year. You could have a tough time in stocks and sometimes there's
752.64s:  some days where the cocoa position was pretty much providing the profits for the day. Just off of that
758.96s:  one position, it was just having that big of a move. Orange juice last year the same way.
764.56s:  They may seem like wacko markets to trade, but they move. They go up and down just like anything.
772.24s:  Crypto's futures. You don't have to trade just in crypto if you don't trust the wallets and all
778.08s:  that nonsense. And in the futures you can go long and short just as easily as anything. So
785.12s:  I trade the Bitcoin futures and the Ether futures. And they move. When they move a lot, you make a lot
793.92s:  of money. They can be doing that at a completely different time when, say, the NASDAQ is having a
803.68s:  rough day or the Russell's having a bad day. All of a sudden the crypto futures are having a good
809.52s:  day. So you just don't know. Or you could be short the crypto futures. And the whole thing is
814.64s:  caving in and the NASDAQ's down and the crypto's down and say you're losing money over there, but
820.08s:  you're making money on the other side. There's lots of different return streams you can
824.40s:  examine out there. And when you start blending them all together, all you do is smooth out your
828.88s:  equity curve. Right. So a lot of it building either inversely correlated, moderately,
834.48s:  inversely correlated or more so to your point non correlated returns things.
838.64s:  Non correlated. Non correlated is always the best. Yeah. inversely correlated if you're attacking
844.40s:  risk of a very specific nature like hedging a stockboard foils. So you're long only on stocks.
850.72s:  You're short on a futures contract of say the standard port is 500 or something. Those two are
856.72s:  intentional inverse correlation item. And you're trying to knock down the risk of the long port
862.80s:  foilio. In the case of just trading diversified contracts. And if you want to be long only,
869.52s:  you can do that or if you want to in some cases, you can go short just as easily as you can go long
875.04s:  in the futures markets. So I like that aspect of it. And yeah, it's you can get so many different
882.56s:  return streams. It's just I can't even keep track of which way I'm leaning on most markets.
888.24s:  Unless I look at the screen 35 is getting beyond my 72 year old brain to absorb almost tickers and
897.04s:  and realize which way I am. So thank goodness for computers and spreadsheets.
903.76s:  So when you're especially in your scenario, 35 markets, you have to size thoughtfully because
912.64s:  the volatility of those markets will be different and those kind of capital value at risk will be
918.88s:  different. So going back to our our DM, this person reaches out, you give them those three
924.40s:  pieces of general advice. And if they have a follow up question, something like, do you have any
930.64s:  general guidance on sizing positions? What would that look like? Sizing positions is a little bit
937.84s:  of a function of the size of your account, your risk tolerance, I would say. And how well you've
947.52s:  designed your trading strategies to in some cases intentionally diversify or oppose each other.
954.40s:  For an example, I have a long term future strategy with those 35 markets where I could be in a
960.96s:  Japanese Yandreid for a year and a half. Okay. But then there's going to be times when the Japanese
966.32s:  Yand goes down, let's say, and I have the potential to pick up a shorter term profits. So I have a
974.24s:  counter trend trading strategy that's on the order of days that would quickly reverse. And I
982.00s:  sized them so that the counter trend strategy is roughly twice the size of the long term strategy.
992.00s:  And the reason for twice is very quickly as it pops off of an overbought oversold condition,
1000.00s:  I take half of that profit off the table and it pays for the trade. So this is an attempt to get
1006.24s:  my reliability up to 50% or more. And I'm not looking to get rich off those counter trend shades,
1013.44s:  I'm just looking to buffer what I know will be a drastic pullback in a long term strategy from a peak
1020.08s:  or a trough as it gets back all the way to its stop loss, which because it's a long term strategy
1026.40s:  is going to be fairly far away. So I have all these different things going on, but those two
1031.76s:  strategies are going to tend to completely fight each other during certain periods of time and
1038.48s:  essentially take my net position down to near to zero. Right, roughly. Now, but that's by design,
1046.16s:  notice I designed it that way. So if you're careful about doing stuff like that, then you can up
1052.08s:  your amount of position sizing because you know that you're protected from that drastic drawdown
1059.44s:  that would happen if you didn't have that second counter trend strategy in there, you know that
1063.76s:  long term strategy is really going to hit you hard. If you size it, what's the long term strategies,
1069.44s:  I run in my own case, it's a retirement portfolio and I'm pretty seasoned. I can handle some rest,
1076.40s:  but I don't like to take on a huge amount. I run my positions at a half of 1% of equity.
1082.96s:  So I would take say a corn contract, I calculate where the stop was,
1088.96s:  I would calculate the value in dollars per bushel or since per bushel of how far that stop is,
1097.04s:  and then I would equate that to my equity and figure out how many contracts do I need to get to a
1102.48s:  half of 1%? Yeah, which immediately answers the second question, actually, funny enough,
1109.04s:  which was thinking about the stop losses, which I think the way that you're doing it there for
1116.24s:  people, it simplifies it exactly to your point quite a lot because some people they go back
1120.64s:  and forth on if they should size something based on the cost of the position relative to the value
1127.12s:  of the portfolio, but in your scenario, kind of you're highlighting a giant gap with that,
1132.24s:  where is what's the risk on that as a value of the portfolio if you're putting it on based on
1137.44s:  overall portfolio size? Yeah, so I think on dollars has also the problem of if you think about it,
1144.72s:  let's say you get in the video and your portfolio and you have some utility stock.
1149.36s:  They're different prices drastically, they're very different in the speed that they move in the
1155.20s:  percentages that they move per position each day. So one might be going up and down per
1163.84s:  cent a day, and the other one's going up a tenth of one per cent a day. If you get the same size
1169.68s:  of both of those positions, then the second one, which is going up a tenth of a percent a day,
1174.96s:  is not really contributing a heck of a lot mathematically. So you kind of start realizing, well,
1181.44s:  I'm just trading this one stock and I've got a few other hidden misses in my portfolio, but
1189.68s:  you're not getting a diversified portfolio, are you getting one thing, one name, and then a
1195.12s:  collection of other garbage that really doesn't make much difference to run a portfolio in my opinion.
1201.92s:  Yeah, just kind of noise. So I always do this. I always make sure, use your price charts, use your
1208.32s:  technique, use your calculator bands and Bollinger bands and Dungeon bands and whatever you use for
1214.16s:  your buying cell. Set your stops first per one share. That's the easy way to do it.
1220.88s:  Now that you know one share or in the case of futures, one contract, same way, then do your
1230.16s:  calculation and say, okay, what would be a half of one per cent of my current equity? And I use
1235.68s:  today's equity. I don't screw around with realized equity and unrealized. It just makes a more
1241.68s:  complicated and you get roughly the same answer. It's not worth a trouble. If you can just look at
1248.08s:  your equity and get that right off your trader's screen usually, multiple times a half a one percent,
1255.12s:  that's how much risk you can take in dollars. How many dollars there are per share? You do
1261.28s:  math that you learned in seventh grade, I believe. Divided out and it tells you, I don't know,
1268.88s:  do 8.9 shares or 80, 89 shares and that's the number you do. It's easy. Yeah, yeah. When you're looking at
1281.44s:  the positions that you're building in futures and you have a longer term position, shorter term
1286.88s:  position, what time frames are you using for those? I don't build positions typically because
1294.24s:  a study I did once showed that the initial trend following signal is always your best return to
1300.64s:  risk and I'm a big return to risk fan. So I really don't want to build additional positions on.
1311.44s:  Are there trades where it would make sense and that you possibly could even find some low risk
1317.52s:  add-ons where you could build a bigger position? Yeah, there probably are, but on average,
1322.80s:  when I did the studies, it diminished the return to risk over time until you get to the day that you
1329.12s:  actually sell out of the thing and then the trades over. So I don't build other positions, but
1337.52s:  so what was your point you were asking then? I was curious about the time frames that you use for
1342.80s:  the longer term positions and the time frames you said it's just a few days. Time frames I would say
1349.12s:  long term would be anything say three weeks or beyond roughly. So something like 21 days
1359.12s:  or beyond something like that. 21 trading days is roughly a month. You're starting to get into
1366.24s:  pretty long term periods there. Counter trend trading I'd be done in the three days or less.
1372.16s:  Right. So two are in very different time frames. I think if you do that, you get a little bit of the
1381.52s:  action where if markets are going sideways, you're going to get that short term one kicking in and
1387.04s:  out and trying to whipsaw a little bit, but hopefully taking small losses. Meanwhile, the long one
1392.32s:  is so long term that it just sort of sits there and doesn't do anything. That'd be kind of what I'd
1397.68s:  try to be getting to. Yeah. And then two other questions off that. The first one is for that long
1405.36s:  position. That's about three weeks out. Are you taking that into expiration and then rolling it
1410.40s:  back out? Or do you have an earlier role period to maintain that exposure? I try to take each contract
1418.96s:  to the point where the new contract is trading at a larger volume and open interest than the
1425.36s:  all content. I just roll it. So in the case of a year and a half trade, depending on what you're
1432.40s:  talking about, I might if it was like a crude oil contract and I happen to be in it that long,
1437.12s:  it'd be something like 15 or 18 rolls that I would go. Got it. And then what's the way that you
1446.00s:  think about adding the counter term trade? Is that just kind of a consistent carry or is it
1451.84s:  something that gets turned on when one of your signals says momentum slowing or whatever the
1456.72s:  case is put on the counter? I traded every day. I just I look for an overbought oversold condition.
1463.20s:  I use a let's see what do I use? I use a daily data and I use a 21 day RSI stochastic.
1476.56s:  And I use 80 for overbought and 20 for oversold. So if I get an overbought condition in an up
1483.60s:  direction, my long term is probably clean and clock and making money. I'm then set up for a short
1490.32s:  sale in the counter trend. And what you'll find many times or I find is that even though I'm overbought,
1498.24s:  you can stay overbought and you can stay overbought and you can stay overbought and day after day,
1503.92s:  I just keep moving up the stop and I keep looking for my next counter trend trade with as long as
1509.92s:  it doesn't want to come, I'm happy. The long term positions just make a money. On the day when it
1516.72s:  starts going the other way though and you get a day like Monday last week where the stocks
1523.44s:  are crashing, then all your counter trends are hitting in and you're just cleaning up. So
1530.48s:  I see. And then when you're rotating this P&L on the shorter term counter trend trades,
1538.40s:  does that impact the way you think about your stop on the longer term trade or they completely
1544.96s:  disparate? Completely separate design to be separate, designed to counter or pose each other,
1551.36s:  but I trade each strategy distinctly according to the prices and the mechanisms and the timing
1558.96s:  period and parameters sets and all that that were the original design for us. It's a very specific
1565.84s:  purpose. Each strategy has its own sort of job in the crew. The crew comes together and does
1572.48s:  its thing and builds my portfolio every day, but each one has a job to do and then on after worry
1580.08s:  about what Joe over here is doing. Right, right. He's got a bit of attention to what he's doing. So
1587.20s:  makes total sense. Now if you were thinking about the same portfolio structure, you were saying
1593.76s:  35 names, obviously you're a season pro and you're kind of like, that's about where I want to be.
1599.60s:  If you were talking to somebody that has a little bit less experience or maybe not the bandwidth
1606.00s:  to monitor 35, what kind of number of positions do you think would make sense for just like a general
1613.92s:  guidance? Let's say it's somebody that's trying to that DM or they're trying to grow their account over
1618.32s:  the next 20 years. I'll give you a couple answers. If you're starting out and you've scratched together
1623.60s:  5,000, you're really putting yourself in a tough spot, but hey, I started with 5,000 back when
1630.96s:  yeah, yeah, a lot of 5,000 I started with it was worth a lot more than 5,000 as today, but
1638.08s:  you know, 5,000 back in the day when I started, probably is more like 15 or 20 today. If you can
1645.12s:  get that together, you got a reasonable shot at now, diversifying a little bit. I'd be shooting
1650.88s:  for probably about 10 positions. You know, if you're just going to be in the stock market, you're
1657.36s:  going to get a lot of correlation amongst stocks. So do which you can define different industries
1662.80s:  that you can put your positions in. Don't just all go out and put it all in tech names or something.
1668.48s:  You're going to take a much wilder ride if you do that. Then I'd also consider micro futures.
1676.96s:  There's some very small futures contracts that you could do five stocks and maybe five futures
1682.48s:  contracts and get a little blend going. That way you got better diversification, you're gaining
1687.28s:  your experience level on both sides. Keep trying to make money and keep trying to add to the
1692.80s:  portfolio. Keep your capital growing. You get up into the, say, a hundred thousand, a hundred thousand
1700.72s:  area and maybe at that point I would see maybe 20 positions would be logical. Maybe 10 of them in
1708.40s:  futures and 10 of them in stocks, something like that spread it around a little bit and then it's
1715.04s:  just more of the same as you get larger. Got it. Quick question on the smaller portfolio,
1720.72s:  the idea of like five futures, give or take five individual names. What kind of futures would
1725.92s:  you focus on? Obviously, if you're trading the micros, you are heavily limited by finding things
1731.52s:  that are good and liquid. There's a handful of things that probably would fit that category. But
1736.64s:  I'm curious which you'd be thinking about. Well, I would look for the smallest possible contracts.
1743.12s:  So the micro ether is fairly small. So the crypto futures contract on the ether side,
1751.04s:  not the bitcoin, that's bigger. But the ether is very small. The number, the new lumber contract,
1756.72s:  they just came out with is very small. You could probably find a micro soybean contract or
1765.44s:  corn contract that would be fairly small. British pound contract isn't massive. You could
1777.76s:  probably do that one. I would give you a start at least. Make sure if you do silver, make sure you
1785.12s:  do the 1000 ounce, not the 5000, which is five times larger. Sugar is not over
1795.36s:  really large. Micro or many natural gas is not very large. Probably trade that one.
1810.96s:  Aussie dollar is not massive. You could probably look at that one.
1817.12s:  Those are some of the start at least. I think it's a great list. The reason I asked those
1821.52s:  questions is a lot of people will ask me about starting like an options portfolio with $5,000.
1827.04s:  And I always struggle with that one. It's like as soon as you place a single trade, you're
1831.68s:  missized. Like you already are in a bad spot. So I kind of asked you the hard question.
1836.56s:  I made you do the heavy work there by coming up with a bunch of good names. So thank you for that.
1840.32s:  The options options are a hands-on problem for a lot of people. I guess if you're trading full-time
1847.36s:  fine, but if you got a $5,000 portfolio, chances are you've got a job someplace I use this.
1853.68s:  But when you're on options, you got the tricky problem of time premium and expiration and
1862.08s:  volatility of the market at that point in time and how emotional people are getting. So
1868.40s:  trying to get that reduced down into the actual underlying underpinning of your profits and
1874.80s:  losses is far more difficult. Futures to me seems simple compared to options.
1880.56s:  Absolutely. Yeah, they absolutely are. And I can put in stops and go out and fix irrigation or go
1887.36s:  play golf or whatever. No problem. I come back in and do my afternoon work, my data run, and I find
1896.08s:  out what I got executed today. Right. Yeah. It's one of the nastiest things I find about
1904.32s:  just the market in general and what expectations are. Because a lot of people, they find their way into
1910.80s:  options thinking that it's fast, easy, leveraged money and exactly to your point. It's why so many
1918.88s:  people just evaporate their money because it's essentially anything but that. So
1925.68s:  yeah. You know, if you're trying to get the lottery ticket and become a billionaire next
1930.40s:  year starting with 5,000, I mean, you got to do you're going to have to take massive amount.
1934.48s:  To leverage. And yeah, okay, maybe the options are the way to go if you that's your total objective.
1940.96s:  Mine, I'm a return to risk. I wanted to make as much money as I can for the minimal risk as possible.
1948.08s:  Right. And I am not. As I said, the other day in an interview, if you dropped another $10,000
1955.04s:  in my portfolio, I would just add it to the account and I would live in the same houses I live and
1960.96s:  drive the same 2019 Serrento Kio that I love. And my life is all kind of planned out. And I know
1972.16s:  where I'm going with my wife on vacation in the next six months and so on. Nothing changes. So
1979.52s:  if my portfolio gets larger, it just gets larger. I just my positions get larger. I probably go to
1985.20s:  the 40 markets and set a 35 and I keep growing and everything and adding maybe another strategy or
1991.12s:  to if it can handle it. Yeah. So when you think about going back to the different markets that you
1997.92s:  participate in, how do you think about divvying up your strategies between the different markets?
2004.48s:  Do you find some markets get the same strategy? Other markets get different strategies? Or how do
2011.60s:  you think about splitting those? I do it more on the basis of what time period and what kind of
2018.56s:  math I'm trying to put in place on a portfolio. And then I apply it uniformly to everything in
2026.00s:  the portfolio. Everything that I think has a shot at being liquid. I mean, before it gets into
2031.76s:  any portfolio, I'd like markets that are liquid and can handle the size that I'm going to throw at it.
2038.24s:  If it's a, I don't know, milk or something and it trades, you know, 20 contracts a day and that's
2047.28s:  for five minutes of the day, yeah, chances are that's not going to be in my portfolio. But if it's
2052.32s:  something like crude oil that's trading 24 hours a day practically and can handle as much sizes I
2059.84s:  want to throw at it, then that's a natural one that's going to be in the portfolio. Once I get
2064.08s:  the portfolio of liquid reasonably sized contracts or stocks or ETFs or whatever it is I'm trying to
2074.08s:  trade. At that point, it would apply the math across the board. Got it. Yeah. And to your point,
2081.12s:  it sounds like one of the things I really enjoy listening to the way that you structure your
2084.64s:  portfolio, it's it's built seemingly for robustness, right? You're coming up with something that
2091.68s:  works and it's not overly complicated. You're not overlaying it so that it becomes this really
2096.72s:  niche thing so that you can step away and fix your irrigation where a lot of other people, they
2102.72s:  might not have that that structure. If it starts getting too complicated and your volatility
2107.04s:  adjusting everything, it seems traders start going down that rabbit hole sooner or later where they
2113.04s:  really start trying to overfit and over modulate every single component. Yeah, I'm not a fan. I keep
2121.20s:  the parameter sets very low and I try to keep the robustness up as high as possible so that basically any
2127.92s:  major run that has happened in the last three, four years I'm in on. Right. Without without a doubt. Yeah.
2140.64s:  One of the one of the other questions I wanted to ask you specifically about the the RSI
2146.08s:  stochastic that you like to use, how do you avoid things like whipsaw in oscillators in general?
2154.24s:  I use a timing indicator or a trunfiling indicator to trigger it. Okay. I don't go in on the overbought
2161.76s:  oversold. I just go in, I look at the okay, the conditions overbought so I need to think about going
2168.96s:  short so where is my short going to come in? I put a stop in and what if the execute is starting to
2174.48s:  relieve itself from that overbought condition and I will not go in until the trunfiling model goes over.
2183.36s:  So I miss I miss out on a little bit of the overbought condition. If you're really doing true mean
2190.16s:  reversion then you're now you got a lot of trouble with your overbought but you stay overbought and
2198.80s:  you stay overbought and you keep shorting and stopping out and then you're still overbought and
2205.76s:  eventually you'll be right and you'll end up making even more money than say a countertrend
2212.16s:  with a countertrend to me means you're using a trunfiling model but sort of in a short term
2217.12s:  direction against a long term trend. Got it. And I prefer to do that. I'm not a main reversion guy. It
2225.68s:  just makes me super uncomfortable. Yeah. Yeah. You have to have a very specific view of markets for that.
2232.32s:  I also it's funny because I identify a lot with your concept. I call it like not trying to top tick
2238.08s:  or bottom tick is the way I think about it. I'm not trying to catch the very tippy top or the very
2243.20s:  low bottom because I find timing those pivots to be as difficult as it sounds to get the day right
2249.92s:  is real real tricky. When you're using your most you almost need to be sitting there all the time and
2256.16s:  I don't want to be sitting there all the time. Yeah. I mean trying to time that is really tricky.
2263.60s:  Yeah and even if you stare at it all day there's a good chance you still get it wrong. So yeah.
2269.12s:  Yeah. Not a not a great return on time in general I would say. Now we have a few minutes left
2274.72s:  when you're overlaying your trend following with your oscillators. How have you dialed in what
2281.60s:  you're using for your trend following so that it fits well with your oscillators?
2290.80s:  I don't know that I have. I'm just using the shorter term. I'm using a conditional indicator to
2297.28s:  say that it's overbought oversold over 21 days. So that's just I feel like if I can look at the
2304.80s:  last month of prices and this is stretched one way or the other that's all I care about knowing.
2310.56s:  I don't need that. And then to time it I am picking a time period that is so short compared to my
2317.92s:  long term that I know it will offset a lot of the drawdown risk of the long term strategy. So
2325.92s:  it's all in a design. I'm not trying to match my short term trend following trigger to the
2334.32s:  overbought oversold condition because to me it's two two separate things. I just want to know that I'm
2341.28s:  stretched and then I want a very short term trigger. So it's all designed to give me what I want.
2348.24s:  I see. Yeah. Makes a ton of sense. And it fits together really well is in it fits like the
2353.68s:  broader portfolio like you're talking about with the way that the risk interacts with each piece.
2358.96s:  The last thing I wanted to ask you is looking out kind of rest of the year. Long time frame. Nobody
2364.56s:  really knows what's going to happen. But I'm curious what your general senses. What kind of things
2369.76s:  interest you going into the tail half of the year? Well, I'm looking at adding the Nika futures to
2377.60s:  my portfolio. So that'll be number 36. And I'm trying to figure out if there's a
2382.88s:  WEC and trade one of the Singapore markets that intrigues me. And it says in the instructions that
2391.20s:  I have to be an institution. I'm not an institution. I'm trading an individual portfolio. So I don't
2397.44s:  know if I can even get the data for this market. But we're going to do some more research on that.
2402.56s:  I'm still working on SIM Trader. So we're still trying to automate that last
2408.72s:  now seventh strategy that I run that I still do by hand every day. It doesn't take a lot of time.
2415.36s:  But you know, it could be 25 minutes on a good day, something like that. But I'd like to get it done
2420.24s:  to about five minutes and free up my time more. So that's being done. And
2427.52s:  just watch what's happening with the election. And going a couple of trips, we've got a seminar
2435.76s:  coming up with Lauren's Benzdorp in October. And we're going to hold it in Malagas, Spain. Perfect.
2442.08s:  Look, we've got we've got lower cost structure over there. So it's a less expensive. So for all those
2448.80s:  US people that have been interested in going to a seminar and didn't like the price tag of the
2454.32s:  Las Vegas one. This one's about $2,000 cheaper because of the cost of paying. And you get Malagas
2462.48s:  Spain, which is right on the Mediterranean tucked right behind Gibraltar. The weather there is
2468.56s:  like Scottsdale with the senior by it is gorgeous. I've been there once before. And Lauren's Benzdorp
2477.44s:  used to live there. So he fixed a super nice hotel right on the right on the sea dinner Friday night
2486.88s:  with sunset and a champagne toast, looking out over the sunset and the Mediterranean. It'll
2492.72s:  should be pretty spectacular. Well, it's awesome. I'll definitely grab links for all of this stuff
2498.32s:  from you to throw in the notes below for everybody to grab a hold so that they can reach out to you
2503.12s:  if they're interested. And then obviously I'll throw a link to your Twitter slash X account.
2510.08s:  We'll get the right one there for everybody so that they're on the correct one. But is there
2514.96s:  anywhere else that you want people to be aware of to go check you out beyond your website?
2520.00s:  Yeah, the website is probably the collection of everything Tom Baso. There's that contains just
2527.36s:  about everything in my career a lot of research papers I've written. Lots of thoughts on lots of
2535.44s:  topics. So you can get that all the interviews as you get this interview package stop. I'll try to
2541.60s:  add it to the interviews page. People can watch there. Yeah, it's pretty extensive website these days.
2549.44s:  So perfect. Then I'll get everybody there because we have to get you down the valley because you have
2555.76s:  a birthday. We have to go get out there and celebrate. But thank you for celebrating some of it
2560.32s:  with us. We're absolutely stoked to chat with you. I always enjoy the opportunity to pick your
2565.52s:  brain a little bit and hopefully pull nuggets out for people to think about how it can apply to
2570.16s:  their own trading because it's always awesome to be able to talk with seasoned folks like you. So
2573.76s:  thanks for hanging out. Yeah, my pleasure Eric. It's always fun talking to you as well.
2578.88s:  Awesome. Beautiful. We'll catch everybody next time. Be an outlier. See you all later.
