0.00s: What's up everyone? Welcome back to the outlier podcast. I have a familiar face. Tom Baso coming to hang out again. First off, happy birthday.
11.00s: Hey, it was a good day. I fixed an irrigation leak in the backyard and I was flagged by that I couldn't figure out and I finally found the leak and got to it and repaired the header and everything's working beautifully now.
27.00s: So I love that. Happy day. I find a big part of home ownership is irrigation maintenance because I literally I literally have two little like hand carts one upstairs, one downstairs, literally for fixing irrigation, which I do all the time. So it sounds like it's a mutual experience because I forgot you're up in the mountains. So I am now. Yeah, I got two houses. We go down to the valley.
55.00s: In the Scottsdale area north Scottsdale for the winter usually, but I'm going down this afternoon because I'm meeting up with some family are coming in from the airport. So I get to go out to dinner with everyone tonight.
68.00s: That's so awesome. I'm stoked. Well, you're looking you're looking great. You're probably healthier than I am right now. So I got a pernated disk. So your boy is.
77.00s: I had a bulging disk that blew good when I was see what I would have been about 50 years old. It finally ruptured and oh my gosh, bad pain.
91.00s: Yeah, and I got a good one. Fortunately, I got one of those fancy shots with the very long needles and surprisingly 15 minutes later after the shot, I walked out completely normal and I haven't had any problem since.
106.00s: Maybe I need to find that shot because mine's been going on for like two weeks and it's not been super fun. So I'll I'll have to look into it. But enough about my broken back. Let's talk about some some markets. So I figured a good place to start actually is with the recent sell off that we had. What do you make of that?
127.00s: We saw it kind of across the indices and yeah, what are your thoughts there?
132.00s: Yeah, I just think it's we had a long time of a lot of up move, a lot of concentration of the money into things like NVIDIA.
144.00s: And I think what ended up happening is everybody was sitting there, you know, having made some nice money and getting a little itchy to take those profits. And I think when the thing started falling in for any excuse, it was like a match on a bunch of gasoline.
162.00s: You know, all of a sudden you had a firestorm.
167.00s: And then now the last week or so it's been trying to climb its way back out of the hole, but.
174.00s: Boy today was one of the quietest days I've ever seen. I gave up and went and fixed irrigation. It was a lot more interesting. And I tied down some netting in the vegetable garden and did some pruning and had a nice day outside took a shower put on the uniform for the inner.
191.00s: And yeah, it's been a nice relaxing day, but there was no point for me to be at my desk for sure.
201.00s: Yeah, one of the things that I thought was interesting to your point, I felt very similar with the sell off. It felt like we had a very just one sided move.
210.00s: It's hard to classify like what over done is, but it just seemed like we're going up.
215.00s: And to me, when the market does that for long enough to your point, I always get the sense that you kind of never know what's going to tilt it, but something typically does.
224.00s: What I thought was interesting though was the series of gap downs into kind of that really strong support day on the fifth where I mean, I had a pretty nasty previous two days.
239.00s: So when you see the market take a bite on a day like the fifth, what do you make of that? Do you think that's kind of just where the market is deciding this is a value area?
249.00s: I like it here. Sell off enough for what do you think?
253.00s: Well, what I think actually is a supply and demand of orders with a lot of computer power behind it means things are going to move very fast and a lot of people are going to adjust their positions very, very quickly.
266.00s: And because of the speed they can do that, I don't know that the support area to me, at least, would be magical at all. I think I think it's just that everybody that wanted to take a profit or sell or get nervous or do whatever they want to do had done it.
287.00s: So the selling kind of subsides a little bit and then everybody starts looking at everybody and deciding, do I want to be the hero that steps in and starts making it go up again.
299.00s: And judging from the last week, they haven't been really excited about that. They've been really, it's been very quiet and making new highs every day, but it's not very much of a new high and the bars are getting skinny.
316.00s: Yeah, that it's funny. I was actually going to, that was my next question is I noticed for the first three to four days of kind of that. I don't want to call it a V because it's not yet.
326.00s: Probably go L. But the first, the first three or four days were I thought kind of moving up. I thought semi quickly.
335.00s: But then it seemed to really start slow down and it sounds like from your opinion, it's been mostly slow across the board.
343.00s: So what do you think of the buying behavior that you saw over the first few days compared to what it looks like now?
350.00s: I would say the buying behavior hasn't been really strong in that boy, the selling was pretty definitely panic mode.
359.00s: And so if this thing touches off again, you could have another leg down and you could be into a full fledged bear market.
366.00s: And a lot of the traders that got their stimulus checks back in 2000 when we had COVID and all that have been trading largely and up market.
378.00s: I've not seen a major bear like down 50%. It could get ugly and could get ugly quickly and it could be take a real bite out of a lot of people's portfolios that they aren't careful.
391.00s: The answer is just to simply think about what you're doing and have a plan.
397.00s: On long positions I can hedge stuff, I can time out of things, I can go short on some of my strategies.
405.00s: I'm not at all worried about a market sell off. It could be actually profitable, but to not have a plan is to fail.
415.00s: Yeah, yeah, completely.
418.00s: To see that, you know, what'll end up happening is, you know, I have a big presence on Twitter and everything and people DM me all the time.
428.00s: And unfortunately, a month or two into the next bear market, whenever it occurs, and if I'm still alive, we will get these DMs and say something to Bob Mr. Baso.
443.00s: I am a bi, I'm a long, only trader in stocks. And I noticed that you went to a down direction and hedged your portfolio, but I didn't do that.
457.00s: And now I'm down 25% and I'm wondering if you could advise me on what I should do now.
464.00s: I get those all the time.
467.00s: I'm asking for you, what's the response? What do you say to that?
471.00s: I usually start with, I don't know what to say. I kind of have been warning people over and over and they have a plan.
481.00s: You didn't develop a plan. I also talked about hedging your portfolio. You didn't hedge it.
487.00s: I mean, I think that the cat has left the building and is wandering around the neighborhood. You want to know what you should do to keep your cat in.
498.00s: You know, I don't know what to tell you.
501.00s: Develop a plan in executed.
504.00s: Get it right the next time.
506.00s: Yeah, those.
507.00s: It's too late now.
508.00s: And I get those all the time right in the middle of big bear markets or bear moves, you know, the COVID crash for instance everybody was panicking so thoroughly panicking.
521.00s: And when they did that, they ended up getting to the point where they were, they were really losing a ton of money.
532.00s: They ended up asking me what to do and I'm thinking, all right, let's see.
539.00s: You could start looking at whether or not you want to buy or whatever get ready for the next cycle the other way.
546.00s: It's a little early to do that because you're in the middle of the downswing, but you know, it's crazy. People just don't think ahead they'll have one way of thinking one strategy and they, you know, in their 10 favorite stocks or something.
560.00s: And there's a whole world. I mean, there's thousands of physicians out there that you could diversify into I'm trading 35 futures markets now I'm trading multiple indicators multiple time period.
574.00s: So, you know, in any, I look at a screen any one day I've got red and green on the screen. I just hope that the green is a little more than the red.
585.00s: You just can't, you know, do one thing one way if you're going to do that, you're going to have to expect some severe drawdowns with no place to hide. You just can't avoid it.
597.00s: Yeah, part of seems to be part of the game.
600.00s: Now, exploring that scenario a little further, let's pretend that that person DMed you before the market dropped.
609.00s: And let's say it's a similar scenario though, let's say that there's still long only which to me is that it's kind of a big crutch because you you miss a lot of different things you can do, but keeping that same level set long only.
622.00s: When you're talking to them about creating a plan, what kind of things would you tell them to take a look at with that plan?
629.00s: The first thing I'd always ask is do you have stop losses on your positions?
634.00s: If you're buying hold and you have no idea where you're going to get out of anything, you don't have a complete trading plan.
640.00s: Think you should have an entry, you should have an exit, trailing stop of some sort.
646.00s: If you have profit objectives and you're trying to limit your gains, not a big fan of that, but there's some strategies where it makes some sense, I suppose.
655.00s: And if you're going to have that, put the limit order in there and take your profit on part of your position or whatever you want to do.
662.00s: But have a total plan. So it's the plan to get in the plan to get out plan to for your initial stop any kind of trailing stop and any kind of method of taking profit.
673.00s: If there is going to be one.
675.00s: Then on top of that, you got to have a plan for how to size your position.
680.00s: Number two, and that's sometimes is more important than I think the first things we talked about, all the buying and selling.
687.00s: Because if you size something too much, you put yourself in harm's way. If you size yourself too small, you might have a great return, but it won't affect your portfolio positively enough for you to make the money you needed to make on that one to pay for the losers that are no doubt going to be able to get out.
704.00s: So you've got to be in balance all the time and position sizing is so important with that.
711.00s: And then the last thing is if you're going to be long only.
715.00s: Can you try to stretch your portfolio out somehow example, you could be long only in stocks, but you could then also look at being long only in corn.
728.00s: And stocks don't have anything to do with each other. So they're going to go up and down at different times.
733.00s: And I'll add to that things like gold things like industrial models things like energy contracts things like meats things like soft like cocoa and orange juice cocoa is at a really good year.
748.00s: You could have a tough time in stocks and sometimes there's some days where the cocoa position was pretty much providing the profits for the day just off of that one position it was just having that big of a move orange juice last year the same way.
766.00s: They may seem like wacko markets to trade, but they move they go up and down just like anything crypto is futures.
774.00s: You don't have to trade just in crypto if you don't trust the wallets and all that nonsense.
779.00s: And in the futures you can go long and short just as easily as anything. So I trade the Bitcoin futures and the ether futures.
789.00s: And they and they move when they move a lot you make a lot of money.
795.00s: It's they can be doing that at a completely different time when say the NASDAQ is having a rough day or the the Russell's having a bad day all of a sudden the crypto futures they haven't a good day.
810.00s: So you just don't know or you could be short the crypto futures and the whole things caving in and the NASDAQs down and the cryptos is down and say you're losing money over there but you're making money on the other side it.
822.00s: There's lots of different return streams you can examine out there and when you start blending them all together all you do is smooth out your equity curve.
830.00s: Right so a lot of it building either inversely correlated moderately inversely correlated or more so to your point non correlated returns things.
839.00s: Non correlated non correlated is always the best.
842.00s: Yeah inversely correlated if you're attacking risk of a very specific nature like hedging a stockboard foils so you're long only on stocks.
851.00s: So you're short on a futures contract of say the stand in port is 500 or something those two are intentional inverse correlation item and you're trying to knock down the risk of the long port for you.
865.00s: In the case of just trading diversified contracts and if you want to be long only you can do that or if you want to in some cases you can go short just as easily as you can go long in the futures markets.
877.00s: I like that aspect of it and yeah it's you can get so many different return streams it's just I can't even keep track of which way I'm leaning on most markets unless I look at the screen 35 is getting beyond my 72 year old brain to absorb almost ticker and and realize which way I am so thank goodness for computers and spreadsheets.
904.00s: So when you're especially in your scenario 35 markets you have to size thoughtfully because the volatility of those markets will be different and those kind of capital value at risk will be different.
920.00s: So going back to our or DM this person reaches out you give them those three pieces of general advice and if they have a follow up question something like do you have any general guidance on sizing positions what would that look like.
935.00s: Sizing positions a little bit of a function of the size of your account your risk tolerance I would say and how well you've designed your trading strategies to in some cases intentionally diversify or oppose each other for an example I have a long term future strategy with those 35 markets where I could be in a Japanese and trade for a year and a half.
964.00s: But then there's going to be times when the Japanese young goes down let's say and I have the potential to pick up a shorter term profits so I have a counter trend trading strategy that's on the order of days that would quickly reverse and I've sized them so that the counter trend strategy is roughly twice the size of the long term strategy and the reason for twice.
993.00s: Twice is very quickly as it pops off of an overbought oversold condition I take half of that profit off the table and it pays for the trade.
1005.00s: So this is an attempt to get my reliability up to 50% or more.
1011.00s: I'm not looking to get rich off those counter trend shades I'm just looking to buffer what I know will be a drastic pullback in a long term strategy from a peak or a trough as it gets back all the way to its stop loss which because it's a long term strategy is going to be fairly far away.
1029.00s: So I have all these different things going on, but those two strategies are going to tend to completely fight each other during certain periods of time and essentially take my net position down to near the zero right roughly now you but that's by design notice I designed it that way.
1048.00s: So if you careful about doing stuff like that then you can up your amount of position sizing because you know that you're protected from that drastic drawdown that would happen if you didn't have that second counter trend strategy in there you know that long term strategy is really going to hit you hard if you size it what's the long term strategies I run in my own case that's a retirement portfolio and I'm pretty seasoned I can handle some rest but I don't like to take on a lot of things.
1077.00s: I don't like to take on a huge amount I run my positions at a half of 1% of equity so I would take say a corn contract I calculate where the stop was I would calculate the value in dollars per bushel of or sense per bushel of how far that stop is and then I would equate that to my equity and figure out how many contracts do I need to get to a half of 1%
1105.00s: Yeah, which immediately answers the second question actually funny enough which was thinking about the stop losses which I think the the way that you're doing it there for people it simplifies it exactly to your point quite a lot because some people they go back and forth on if they should size something based on you know the cost of the position relative to the value of the portfolio but in your scenario kind of you're highlighting a giant gap with that where is what's the risk on that as a value of 1%
1134.00s: on that as a value of the portfolio if you're putting it on based on overall portfolio size.
1139.00s: Yeah, so I think on dollars has also the problem of if you think about it let's say you got in the video in your portfolio and you have some utility stock.
1149.00s: There are different prices drastically they're very different in the speed that they move in the percentages that they move per.
1158.00s: So you know, you know, one might be going up and down a percent a day and the other one's going up a tenth of 1% a day if you get the same size of both of those positions then the second one which is going up a tenth of a percent a day is not really contributing heck of a lot mathematically so you kind of start realizing well I'm just trading this one stock and I've got a few other hit and misses in my portfolio but I think that's a good thing.
1187.00s: I think I'm not going to get a portfolio but it's you're not getting a diversified portfolio you're getting one thing one name and then a collection of other garbage that really doesn't make much difference right to run a portfolio in my opinion.
1202.00s: Yeah, just kind of noise.
1205.00s: You do that's always make sure use your price charts use your technique use your kelton or bands and Bollinger bands and Dungeon bands and whatever you use for your buying cell set your stops first per one share that's the easy way to do it right now that you know one share or in the case of futures one contract same way.
1230.00s: If you're a calculation say okay what would be a half of 1% of my current equity and I use today's equity I don't screw around with realized equity and unrealized it just makes a more complicated and you get roughly the same answer it's not worth of trouble.
1247.00s: If you can just look at your equity and get that right off your trader screen usually multiple times a half of 1% that's how much risk you can take in dollars you know how many dollars there are per share.
1259.00s: You do math that you learned in seventh grade I believe divided out and it tells you you know I don't know do 8.9 shares or 80 89 shares and that's the number you do it's easy.
1278.00s: Yeah yeah when you're looking at the positions that you're building in futures and you have a longer term position shorter term position what time frames are you using for those.
1290.00s: I don't build positions typically because a study I did want to show that the initial trend following signal is always your best return to risk and I'm a big return to risk.
1304.00s: So I really don't want to build additional positions on are there trades where it would make sense and that you possibly could even find some low risk add-ons where you could build a bigger position yeah there probably are but on average when I did the studies it diminished the return to risk over time until you get to the day that you actually sell out of the thing and then the trades over.
1333.00s: So I don't build other positions but what so what was your point you were asking then I was curious about the time frames that you use for the longer term positions and the time frames you said it's just a few days time frames I would say long term would be anything say three weeks or beyond roughly so something like 21 days or beyond something like that 21.2.3.
1362.00s: 21 trading days is roughly a month you're starting to get into pretty long term periods there counter trend trading I'd be done in the three days or less right so two are in very different time frames I think if you do that you get a little bit of the action where if markets are going sideways you're going to get that short term one kicking in and out and trying to whipsaw a little bit but hopefully taking small losses.
1391.00s: Meanwhile the long one is so long term that it just sort of sits there and doesn't do anything that be kind of what I try to be getting to.
1400.00s: Yeah and then two other questions off that the first one is for that long position that's about three weeks out are you taking that into expiration and then rolling it back out or do you have earlier role period to maintain that exposure.
1416.00s: I try to take each contract to the point where the new contract is trading at a larger volume and open interest than the only time night just roll it so in the case of a year and a half trade depending on what you're talking about I might if it was like a crude oil contract and I happen to be in it that long it'd be something like 15 or 18 rolls that I would go.
1443.00s: Got it and then what's the way that you think about adding the counter term trade is that just kind of a consistent carry or is it something that gets turned on when one of your signals says momentum slowing or whatever the case is put on the count.
1458.00s: I traded every day I just I look for an over bought over sold condition I use a let's see what do I use I use a.
1467.00s: Daily data and I use a 21 day.
1473.00s: RSI still cast it and I use 80 for over bought and 20 for over sold so if I get an over bought condition and an up direction my long term is probably clean and clock and making money.
1488.00s: I'm then set up for a short sale in the counter trend and what you find many times or I find is that even though I'm over bought you can stay over bought and you can stay over bought and you can stay over bought and day after day I just keep moving up the stop and I keep looking for my next counter trend trade with as long as it doesn't want to come I'm happy the long term positions just make a money.
1515.00s: On the day when it starts going the other way though and you get a day like Monday last week where the stocks are crashing.
1525.00s: Then all your counter trends are hitting in and you're just cleaning up so.
1530.00s: I see and then when you're rotating this P N L on the shorter term counter trend trades does that impact the way you think about your stop on the longer term trade or they completely disparate.
1546.00s: Completely separate design to be separate design to counter pose each other but I trade each strategy distinctly according to the prices and the mechanisms and the timing and time period parameters sets and all that that were the original design for it's a very specific purpose.
1566.00s: Each strategy has its own sort of job in the crew the crew comes together and does its thing and builds my portfolio every day but each one has a job to do and then on after worry about what Joe over here is doing right right yeah you've got to be a touch on what he's doing so makes total sense now if you were thinking about the same portfolio structure you were saying 35 names obviously you're a season of the same.
1595.00s: So you're actually you're a season pro and you're kind of like that's about where I want to be if you were talking to somebody that has you know a little bit less experience or maybe not the bandwidth to monitor 35.
1608.00s: What kind of number of positions do you think would make sense for just like a general guidance let's say it's somebody that's trying to that DM are trying to grow their account over the next 20 years.
1620.00s: I'll give you a couple answers if you're starting out and you've scratched together 5000 you're really putting yourself in a tough spot but hey I started with 5000 back when yeah the question 5000 I started with it was worth a lot more than 5000 is today but you know 5000 back in the day when I started probably is more like 15 or 20 today if you can get that together you got a reasonable shot at now diversifying a little bit.
1649.00s: I'd be shooting for probably about 10 positions you you know if you're just going to be in the stock market you're going to get a lot of correlation amongst stocks so do which you can define different industries that you can put your positions and don't just all go out and put it all in tech names or something you're going to take a much wilder ride if you do that.
1671.00s: Then I'd also consider micro futures there's some very small futures contracts that you could do five stocks and maybe five futures contracts and get a little blend going that way you got better diversification you're gaining your experience level on both sides keep trying to make money and keep trying to add to the portfolio keep your capital growing you get up into the.
1696.00s: Say a hundred thousand hundred thousand area and maybe at that point I would see maybe 20 positions would be logical maybe 10 of them in futures and 10 of them in stocks something like that spread it around a little bit and then it's just more of the same as you get larger.
1717.60s: Got it quick question on the smaller portfolio the idea of like five futures give or take five individual names what kind of futures would you focus on obviously if you're trading the microse you are heavily limited by finding things that are good and liquid there's a handful of things that probably would fit that category but I'm curious which which you'd be thinking about.
1739.60s: Well I would look for the smallest possible contracts so the micro ether is fairly small so the crypto futures contract on the ether side not the Bitcoin that's bigger but the ether is very small the lumber the new lumber contract they just came out with is very small.
1761.00s: You could probably find a micro soybean contract or corn contract that would be fairly small.
1769.00s: Um.
1774.00s: British pound contract isn't massive you could probably do that one.
1780.00s: I'll give you a start at least make sure if you do silver make sure you do the 1000 ounce not the not the 5000 which is five times larger.
1792.00s: Sugar is not overly large.
1797.00s: I think it's a great list the reason I asked those questions is a lot of people will ask me about starting like an option portfolio with 5000 dollars.
1807.00s: And I always struggle with that one since it's like as soon as you place a single trade you're miss sized like you already are in a bad spot so I kind of asked you the hard question a major question.
1817.00s: Do the heavy work there by coming up with a bunch of good names so thank you for that.
1821.00s: Options options are a hands on problem for a lot of people I guess if you're trading full time.
1827.00s: I'm not going to be able to do that.
1837.00s: I'm not going to be able to do that.
1840.00s: I'm not going to be able to do that.
1842.00s: I'm not going to be able to do that.
1843.00s: I'm not going to be able to do that.
1846.00s: I'm not going to be able to do that.
1847.00s: I'm not going to be able to do that.
1848.00s: I'm not going to be able to do that.
1849.00s: I'm not going to be able to do that.
1850.00s: I'm not going to be able to do that.
1851.00s: I'm not going to be able to do that.
1852.00s: I'm not going to be able to do that.
1853.00s: I'm not going to be able to do that.
1854.00s: I'm not going to be able to do that.
1855.00s: I'm not going to be able to do that.
1856.00s: I'm not going to be able to do that.
1857.00s: I'm not going to be able to do that.
1858.00s: I'm not going to be able to do that.
1859.00s: I'm not going to be able to do that.
1861.00s: I'm not going to be able to do that.
1862.00s: I'm not going to be able to do that.
1863.00s: I'm not going to be able to do that.
1865.00s: I'm not going to be able to do that.
1866.00s: I'm not going to be able to do that.
1867.00s: I'm not going to be able to do that.
1868.00s: I'm not going to be able to do that.
1869.00s: I'm not going to be able to do that.
1870.00s: I'm not going to be able to do that.
1871.00s: I'm not going to be able to do that.
1872.00s: I'm not going to be able to do that.
1873.00s: I'm not going to be able to do that.
1874.00s: I'm not going to be able to do that.
1875.00s: I'm not going to be able to do that.
1876.00s: I'm not going to be able to do that.
1877.00s: I'm not going to be able to do that.
1878.00s: I'm not going to be able to do that.
1880.00s: I'm not going to be able to do that.
1881.00s: It's me seems simple compared to options.
1883.00s: Right.
1884.00s: Yeah.
1885.00s: Yeah.
1886.00s: Yeah.
1887.00s: Yeah.
1888.00s: Absolutely.
1889.00s: Yeah.
1896.00s: Yeah.
1897.00s: Yeah.
1898.00s: Yeah.
1899.00s: Yeah.
1901.00s: Yeah.
1902.00s: Yeah.
1903.00s: And I can put in stops and go out
1905.00s: and fix irrigation or go to play golf or whatever.
1906.00s: general and what expectations are because a lot of people, they find their way into options
1911.34s: thinking that it's fast, easy, leveraged money and exactly to your point. It's why so
1918.64s: many people just evaporate their money because it's essentially anything but that.
1923.84s: So, yeah.
1925.84s: You know, if you're trying to get the lottery ticket and become a billionaire next year,
1930.56s: starting with 5,000, I mean, you got to do, you're going to have to take massive amount
1934.56s: of leverage.
1936.40s: And yeah, okay, maybe the options are the way to go if you, that's your total objective.
1941.32s: Mine, I'm a return to risk guy. I wanted to make as much money as I can for the minimal
1946.44s: risk as possible.
1948.60s: And I am not, as I said the other day in an interview, if you dropped another $10,000
1955.12s: in my portfolio, I would just add it to the account and I would live in the same houses
1960.36s: I live and drive the same 2019 Serrento Kio that I love.
1967.16s: And my life is all kind of planned out. And I know where I'm going with my wife on vacation,
1975.12s: the next six months and so on. Nothing changes.
1978.96s: So if my portfolio gets larger, it just gets larger. My positions get larger. I probably
1984.96s: go to 40 markets and so on to 35. I keep growing and everything and adding maybe another
1990.40s: strategy or two if you can handle it.
1993.28s: Yeah, so when you think about going back to the different markets that you participate
1998.72s: in, how do you think about divvying up your strategies between the different markets? Do
2004.64s: you find some markets get the same strategy, other markets get different strategies?
2011.20s: Or how do you think about splitting those?
2014.24s: I do it more on the basis of what time period and what kind of math I'm trying to put in place
2021.36s: on a portfolio. And then I apply it uniformly to everything in the portfolio, everything
2027.64s: that I think has a shot at being liquid. I mean, before it gets into any portfolio, I'd
2033.36s: like markets that are liquid and can handle the size that I'm going to throw at it. If
2039.52s: it's milk or something and it trades 20 contracts a day and that's for five minutes of the day,
2049.60s: chances are that's not going to be in my portfolio. But if it's something like crude oil,
2053.76s: it's trading 24 hours a day practically and can handle as much sizes I want to throw at it,
2060.72s: then that's a natural one that's going to be in the portfolio. Once I get the portfolio of liquid,
2066.16s: reasonably sized contracts or stocks or ETFs or whatever it is I'm trying to trade,
2074.40s: I at that point would apply the math across the board.
2078.96s: Got it. Yeah. And to your point, it sounds like one of the things I really enjoy listening to
2083.60s: the way that you structure your portfolio, it's it's built seemingly for robustness, right?
2089.04s: You're coming up with something that works and it's not overly complicated. You're not overlaying
2095.44s: it so that it becomes this really niche thing so that you can step away and fix your irrigation,
2100.80s: where a lot of other people they might not have that that structure if it starts getting too
2105.44s: complicated and your volatility adjusting everything. It seems traders start going down that
2111.20s: rabbit hole sooner or later where they really start trying to overfit and over modulate every
2117.92s: single component. Yeah, I'm not a fan. I keep the parameter, so it's very low and I try to keep
2124.56s: the robustness up as high as possible so that basically any major run that has happened in the
2131.84s: last three, four years I'm in on. Right. Without a doubt. Yeah. One of the other questions I wanted
2143.52s: to ask you specifically about the the RSI stochastic that you like to use, how do you avoid things
2149.68s: like whipsaw in oscillators in general? I use a timing indicator or a trunfiling indicator to
2157.68s: trigger it. Okay. I don't go in on the overbought oversold. I just go in, I look at the conditions
2166.96s: overbought so I need to think about going short. So where is my short going to come in? I put a stop
2172.08s: in and when it executes it's starting to relieve itself from that overbought condition. And I will not
2179.84s: go in until the trunfiling model goes over. So I miss I miss out on a little bit of the overbought
2187.52s: condition. If you're really doing true mean reversion, then you're now you got a lot of trouble with
2196.40s: your overbought, but you stay overbought and you stay overbought and you keep shorting and stopping
2202.40s: out and then you're still overbought and eventually you'll be right and you'll end up making
2209.04s: even more money than say a countertrend would countertrend to me means you're using a trunfiling
2215.28s: model, but sort of in a short term direction against the long term trend. And I prefer to do that.
2223.76s: I'm not a main reversion guy. It just makes me super uncomfortable.
2228.48s: Yeah, yeah, you have to have a very specific view of markets for that. I also, it's funny
2233.68s: because I identify a lot with your concept. I call it like not trying to top tick or bottom tick
2239.20s: is the way I think about it. I'm not trying to catch the very tippy top or the very, you know, low
2243.84s: bottom because I find timing those pivots to be as difficult as it sounds to get the day right
2249.92s: is real real tricky. When you're using your most you almost need to be sitting there all the time
2256.08s: and I don't want to be sitting there all the time. Yeah, I mean, trying to time that is really tricky.
2263.60s: Yeah, and even if you stare at it all day, there's a good chance you still get it wrong. So yeah,
2269.12s: yeah, not a not a great return on time in general, I would say. Now, we have a few minutes left
2274.48s: when you're overlaying your trend following with your oscillators. How have you dialed in
2281.36s: what you're using for your trend following so that it fits well with your oscillators?
2290.80s: I don't know that I have. I'm just using the sharder term. I'm using a conditional indicator to say
2297.52s: that it's overbought oversold over 21 days. So that's just I feel like if I can look at the last
2305.04s: month of prices and this is stretched one way or the other, that's all I care about knowing.
2310.64s: I don't need that. And then to time it, I am picking a time period that is so short compared to my
2317.92s: long term that I know it will offset a lot of the drawdown risk of the long term strategy. So
2325.92s: it's all in a design. I'm not trying to match my short term trend following trigger to the
2334.24s: overbought oversold condition because to me, it's two two separate things. I just want to know
2340.40s: that I'm stretched and then I want a very short term trigger. So it's all designed to give me
2346.88s: what I want. I see. Yeah, it makes a ton of sense. And it fits together really well is in it fits
2353.36s: like the broader portfolio like you're talking about with the way that the risk interacts with
2357.76s: each piece. The last thing I wanted to ask you is looking out kind of rest of the year, long time
2363.92s: frame. Nobody really knows what's going to happen. But I'm curious what your general sense is.
2368.64s: What kind of things interest you going into the tail half of the year? Well, I'm looking at adding
2375.44s: the Nikke futures to my portfolio. So that'll be number 36. And I'm trying to figure out if there's
2382.80s: a way I can trade one of the Singapore markets that entrace me. And it says in the instructions that
2391.20s: I have to be an institution. I'm not an institution. I'm trading an individual portfolio. So I don't
2397.44s: know if I can even get the data for this market. But we're going to do some more research on that.
2403.52s: Still working on SIM trader. So we're still trying to automate that last
2408.72s: now seventh strategy that I run that I still do by hand every day. It doesn't take a lot of time,
2415.36s: but you know, it could be 25 minutes on a good day, something like that. But I'd like to get it
2420.00s: down to about five minutes and free up my time more. So that's being done. And just watch what's
2430.32s: happening with the election and going a couple of trips. We've got a seminar coming up with Lauren's
2436.88s: Benzdorp in October. And we're going to hold it in Malagas, Spain. Perfect. Love that. We've got
2444.24s: lower cost structure over there. So it's a little less expensive. So for all those US people that
2450.00s: have been interested in going to a seminar and didn't like the price tag of the Las Vegas one.
2455.60s: This one's about $2,000 cheaper because of the cost of paying. And you get Malagas,
2462.48s: Spain, which is right on the Mediterranean tucked right behind Gibraltar. The weather there is
2468.64s: like Scottsdale with the senior by it is gorgeous. I've been there once before. And Lauren's Benzdorp
2477.44s: used to live there. So he fixed a super nice hotel right on the right on the sea dinner Friday night
2486.96s: with sunset and a champagne toast looking out over the sunset and the Mediterranean. It'll
2492.72s: be pretty spectacular. Well, it's awesome. I'll definitely grab links for all of this stuff from
2498.48s: you to throw in the notes below for everybody to grab a hold so that they can reach out to you.
2503.04s: If they're interested and then obviously I'll throw a link to your Twitter slash X account. We'll
2510.32s: get the right one there for everybody so that they're on the correct one. But is there anywhere else
2516.08s: that you want people to be aware of to go check you out beyond your website? Yeah, the website is
2521.20s: probably the collection of everything Tom Baso. That contains just about everything in my career.
2528.96s: A lot of research papers I've written. Lots of thoughts on lots of topics. So you can get that.
2538.24s: All the interviews as you get this interview package stop. I'll try to add it to the interviews page.
2543.28s: People can watch there. Yeah, it's pretty extensive website these days. So perfect. Then I'll
2551.36s: get everybody there because we have to get you down the valley because you have a birthday. We have
2557.04s: to go get out there and celebrate. But thank you for celebrating some of it with us. We're absolutely
2561.52s: stoked to chat with you. I always enjoy the opportunity to pick your brain a little bit and hopefully
2566.72s: pull nuggets out for people to think about how it can apply to their own trading because it's always
2571.60s: awesome to be able to talk with seasoned folks like you. So thanks for hanging out. Yeah, my pleasure
2576.32s: Eric. It's always fun talking to you as well. Awesome. Beautiful. We'll catch everybody next time
2581.36s: being outlier. See y'all later.
