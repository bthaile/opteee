0.00s: All right, you guys. I thought today was an off day, but GameStop is well being GameStop.
6.72s: Today I was looking at the options chain kind of going through markets doing my standard
11.68s: scan quiet Wednesday afternoon. I thought we were just going to be managing existing
17.60s: positions, maybe see if anything weird is going on. And then GameStop does this, something
23.88s: super weird. And I'm curious if you could tell what it is right from what you're seeing
28.08s: here. It might be a little difficult to see this one, but this is the options chain
31.40s: from today, the 19th of June, and it's in the evening. It's like seven o'clock Pacific
37.80s: time. And this is what I see. That's really super surprising to me at this point. There
45.40s: is a 47 point increase in the volatility in the front expiration cycle that is due to
53.84s: expiring two days. The market was closed today, yet this is up massively from where the
61.08s: market closed yesterday. Now, if you were called from the conversation yesterday, the
67.60s: move down here didn't surprise me after the shareholders meeting came through, made sense.
72.68s: I actually thought after the shares shareholders meeting, we would have gone closer to this
76.44s: right from the jump, took an extra day, sometimes all bleeds out a little more slowly. But
82.04s: then I did not expect at all to see a near 50 point increase in volatility with two days
90.80s: left to go. The other thing is right now, I cannot see a clear catalyst of sorts. I genuinely
100.48s: do not know why this would be up 47 points. In addition, that I also find really interesting
107.28s: is the next expiration cycle also went up 10 points. It went from 151 24 up to 161 17.
117.80s: That is also not in insignificant move for something like this. It's almost a 10% increase.
124.60s: So something again is going on. And as I was looking through trying to figure out what
131.88s: this is, why this might be happening, what this, what's driving it? I cannot find a clear
138.96s: answer here. I don't see anything in the options chain that's absolutely out of place to
143.96s: me. We did talk about these series of really large orders at the 30s, which is still massive.
151.12s: And then the 35s. But the problem that these orders are going to face is the insane theta
156.92s: decay that they're going to experience over the next couple days. So for example, the 35s,
162.04s: they have 18, 19 cents left of total value, but the theta decay is 17 cents on the day.
167.16s: So it means after a day passes, essentially, these become worthless. Even the 30s, they're
172.28s: going to lose essentially their entire value after the pass of a single day. Right now,
177.56s: they're worth 33 cents. Theta to K. And then it's 27 cents. So unless there's this some sort
183.80s: of massive accommodating move that I still genuinely don't see. And as I continue to remind
190.40s: people, I am not here to spread hype or fudge. I'm doing my best just to look at the data
197.36s: and share what I'm seeing. And right now, I'm confused. I don't see what's driving this
203.44s: as of right now. So part of the reason for this video is to ask you guys, if you're seeing anything
208.32s: that can explain what's happening right now, because I don't see it. Now a couple of other things
213.60s: that I wanted to take a look at was the volatility smile. We've been looking at this pretty regularly
218.56s: together now. And one of the things I did notice compared to what I was looking at yesterday
224.72s: was kind of twofold. The first thing was this kind of smile on the next week expiration is about
233.20s: the same. It flattened out a little bit in the tail. But the smile for this expiration did actually
239.92s: see an uptick in the implied volatility being applied to the out of the money calls. So I can't fully
247.60s: tell if that's just the market kind of dealing with this excessively high open interest with a really
253.52s: short duration left. And we need to see what happens to the 70,000 open interest at the 30s,
260.80s: because there was 42,000 volume yesterday. And these obviously didn't update yet. Today's not
266.16s: a trading day. The update tomorrow. So I'm really interested to see what this 70,000 turns into.
273.36s: And if there's significant buying going on here, that does start to get a little interesting.
279.28s: We can see that there's a lot of volatility wrapped around this specific strike 258%. But
286.80s: again, I don't see what's driving us here. So interesting. Fine. This has even gone up since we're
294.08s: talking literally already. It was 207 85 when we were looking at it last and it's ready up to 20860.
301.52s: So this is not moving an insignificant amount. I wanted to share it with you guys. I don't know
306.40s: exactly what's going on yet, but this looks interesting to me. So we will see what happens tomorrow.
312.08s: Catch you guys later.
