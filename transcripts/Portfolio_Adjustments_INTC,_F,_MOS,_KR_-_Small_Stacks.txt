0.88s: hey everyone eric here we got some small
3.04s: stacks updates to get through so wanted
5.60s: to jump into those very quickly
8.32s: in short the account is actually pretty
11.04s: allocated a little more than i was
12.24s: expecting it to be but
13.76s: i like what i have on so let's go to the
15.44s: screen okay so right now
18.56s: the account value is 5917
22.08s: utilization's 4092 and we're about
25.84s: 70 utilized total p l
29.12s: not just over 9 900 bucks and that
31.36s: represents a 15.
33.24s: 15.5 return
36.16s: um and right now we have 255
41.12s: out which is a 4.31
44.48s: return on the account so let's see the
47.04s: uh the
47.84s: trades that have been made first off if
49.68s: you'll notice ford
50.96s: is down so i took that entire trade down
54.64s: um total p l in it was 124
58.08s: after closing the short calls
61.68s: and that's a 13.7 percent return on
65.12s: invest capital in that trade so
67.36s: that was pretty much an easy win as far
70.08s: as i could tell
71.28s: i do like ford still it's something that
73.20s: i might revisit
74.88s: but just seeing the move that it made it
76.88s: essentially made the move that i was
77.92s: looking for it to
78.72s: so i didn't maintain exposure
82.64s: so if we take a quick look and kind of
84.48s: see what i'm talking about when i first
86.96s: entered ford it was quite a bit lower um
89.84s: definitely in the sevens
91.76s: like mid sevens and or maybe yeah
94.64s: definitely mid sevens i don't totally
96.24s: remember what the price was on entry i'd
97.76s: have to look at the date
99.92s: but essentially after it made this high
101.76s: i was getting ready to unwind
103.68s: and then just on the down date today it
105.52s: just made sense
107.52s: to take the whole position down so
110.08s: that's where we're at
111.28s: in ford then
114.40s: for uh uh
117.52s: kroger the only adjustment that i'm i
120.32s: think that's this one
121.68s: yeah so for in kroger it's pretty simple
124.24s: all i did was take the
125.76s: short call down at a profit and i did
129.28s: not
129.92s: lay anything new out and the reason for
133.04s: that
133.52s: is as things sit right now
137.12s: um i would i could sell at the 35.5 or
141.44s: at the 36
142.88s: strike but uh short calls but it
145.84s: wouldn't make that much money
147.20s: so i would rather just leave it uncapped
149.68s: for now
150.72s: the trade itself is still returning well
152.88s: i've realized 288 dollars in profit with
156.16s: uh
156.56s: 1357 outlay so overall it's returning
160.00s: well
160.40s: i i'm not gonna um prematurely close off
164.16s: the potential profit now one strategy i
167.76s: am looking at in here is maybe
171.04s: selling one call on a rebound
174.72s: and then leaving it at a ratio
177.84s: kind of like that so if we take a look
179.36s: real quick at kroger
181.12s: you'll see it's made a move down
184.96s: it's made a move back down to this minus
186.88s: two and that's why i'm not really in a
188.88s: big rush
190.00s: to sell the calls it could obviously
192.88s: continue down
193.84s: for sure but just based on general
197.12s: my general approach to trading seeing it
199.92s: hold
201.28s: this 200-day moving average and be at a
203.36s: negative two
204.48s: standard deviation i think overall
207.76s: i probably would favor at least some
210.32s: sort of move to the upside even if it's
212.40s: limited
213.44s: so if i see that that's when i'll start
216.48s: adding a couple short calls there is
219.12s: definitely some premium
220.56s: in there even at the lower deltas like
223.28s: if i were to sell 35.5 but it's just not
225.28s: enough
226.80s: compared to what i know i can get
231.36s: so this is one that i intend to
234.56s: keep an eye on and then
237.92s: finally you'll notice a new
241.04s: diagonal in intel so this is actually a
244.00s: position that
245.28s: i'm mirroring a similar version in my
248.32s: margin account
249.20s: not quite the same simply because i just
252.00s: went with short puts in there but
253.20s: generally bullish
254.72s: and obviously couldn't afford that
257.36s: realistically in the small stacks
258.96s: account so instead i went with
261.12s: the diagonal and i took in the
264.40s: 18 june 21 37 and a half calls and i
268.24s: paid 10 dollars 35 cents
270.56s: and then i sold the four ds 47 calls
274.48s: and i got a dollar 65 at a 48 delta
277.76s: so that's a 165 credit
281.44s: and almost a 16 return on invested
284.48s: capital which again
285.60s: would be completely happy with that
288.64s: this is a slightly tricky position
292.16s: because i do not want it to take a third
294.64s: of the account
295.60s: third represent 33 of of the account or
298.72s: so
300.00s: and i say that because right now i have
301.84s: two thousand dollars allocated to it
304.00s: that was more just kind of taking a look
306.00s: more probable than anything
308.72s: i will not add to this trade unless it
311.60s: comes down significantly
313.12s: and i could add something for like six
315.92s: hundred dollars
317.28s: that i would consider kind of taking
319.12s: that allotment down from 2000 like 1500
321.68s: is probably the way forward here and
324.56s: i really like intel but just general
327.44s: good portfolio management i don't want
329.68s: this position to represent that much of
332.00s: the account
333.36s: and then so in here i did sell the
336.80s: short call against it and it's mostly
340.08s: because the premium was really good
342.40s: i still think that the propensity for
345.68s: this trade is
346.72s: for that short call to fall in the money
349.28s: at least some point
350.80s: relatively in the future i i don't see
353.12s: intel you know necessarily staying down
355.04s: here at 46
356.64s: but nonetheless i wanted to make sure
359.60s: that i kind of realized that premium up
361.84s: front so
362.72s: best case scenario just like any other
364.72s: diagonal is the
366.64s: short call falls in the money and then i
368.96s: have to manage it that way which would
370.16s: be totally cool
371.68s: no sweat with that but um otherwise this
375.36s: trade will kind of be set and forget and
376.80s: we'll revisit it in
378.32s: closer to december and then lastly
381.44s: i have a short put out in mosaic at 17.
385.76s: this was honestly a really good trade
389.12s: for me because i like mosaic
391.44s: and this bit of a down move has moved it
394.40s: closer to where i could reasonably enter
397.36s: now there is earnings coming up which i
400.88s: perceive to be a positive catalyst this
404.16s: is not necessarily an earnings play
405.92s: outright if you'll notice how far out in
407.60s: time i went but i was using the earnings
411.52s: increase in volatility to try to
413.12s: increase the return on the position
414.64s: collecting 90 cents on a 17 strike is
417.20s: obviously really good premium
419.04s: if i do get a balance leading into
420.96s: earnings or
422.32s: you know bleed off of volatility i will
424.16s: take the trade down
426.08s: for a smaller profit maybe 20 or so but
429.36s: if it doesn't happen and i run this into
431.68s: earnings i'm okay with it
433.20s: we'll see you know how earnings goes but
435.20s: this is a cash secured put for me so
436.88s: this is something that i would not mind
438.88s: owning longer term it would utilize
441.36s: seventeen hundred dollars
442.56s: and that's fine so all in all the
445.60s: account is relatively utilized at this
448.16s: point i found a few trades to put on
449.68s: that i like
451.04s: and we'll see big dependency really is
454.96s: kroger i want to add those short calls
456.88s: when i
457.36s: pretty much soon as i can because that's
458.64s: realized money i just don't want to do
460.40s: it down here
461.44s: for intel and mosaic those are almost
463.76s: set it and forget just kind of check it
465.20s: in a few weeks and see what they're
466.32s: doing
467.12s: but right now i like where the account
469.36s: is unlike my margin account
471.92s: small stacks is staying allocated it's
473.84s: too little money
475.20s: again if there's some sort of big down
478.00s: move
478.80s: after the election i don't really care
481.52s: because
482.24s: i'll hold the products that i have and
486.00s: the small stacks account i can't say it
487.84s: enough it's not going to be the thing
489.36s: that's going to make anybody rich it's
490.88s: you're not going to turn that
492.08s: 5000 even 100 000 into your future you
495.04s: know wealth
496.08s: this is working through mechanics and
498.00s: strategy
499.12s: and really proof of concept that we can
502.64s: implement a successful strategy so
504.32s: that's why i'm not as concerned about
505.76s: preservation of capital in this account
508.08s: as compared to what i'm doing in my
509.60s: margin account which is more so
511.44s: scaling into the election just to limit
514.56s: uh exposure to that binary event i'm not
517.12s: applying that same paradigm here
519.28s: so we'll see what this looks like i do
522.32s: think that this will be
523.36s: relatively quiet at least for a week or
525.76s: two
526.48s: and the next trade i expect to make
528.64s: would be short calls in kroger
530.72s: to add some short premium there or
534.16s: i'm closing mosaic out leading into
536.00s: earnings otherwise
537.52s: we should be pretty static as always if
539.84s: there's any questions or anything
540.88s: anybody wants to work through let me
542.16s: know
542.80s: and i will catch everybody later
