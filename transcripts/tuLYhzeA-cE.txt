726.00s:  you
750.00s:  And let's say I do the same thing here. So what is that? One, two, three, four.
753.44s:  So we go from here, one, two, three, four. Unfortunately, it's really close to this.
760.40s:  What's the difference between these bands? Let's say that there's tension as you can see on the first
766.08s:  band. And then what I was trying to make clear on the second band is that there's some slack.
770.08s:  So as I expand, as I pull these bands up, what's the difference between these two bands? If I were
777.04s:  maybe to just let go of the band, what do you, what do you think would happen if we were to run
782.48s:  a little, little trading experiment together? And we have these two bands, top band, bottom band.
788.40s:  I expand them both the same distance through the same length pretend they're the same length.
793.12s:  They're not really this one should be over here. There you go.
798.88s:  Lauren is on it. This top band would have probably much greater downward force as soon as I let go
806.88s:  of it. The one with slack can kind of take up some space. So maybe the band with looks like this
815.60s:  once we stretch it out, right? The point that I'm trying to make here is the concept of actual mean
822.48s:  reversion. Mean reversion is this function, whereas something gets too extended one way or the other.
831.68s:  So in this case, if we extend it this way or this way, these bands, this band wants to come back
839.04s:  here, wants to be about this range here. This band doesn't really care as much. This band will say,
848.88s:  okay, well, you you stretch me to this point up here. And once the slack is out, I'm already at this
855.28s:  point. So then if you let go of me from here, I'm just going to cover this distance. I don't really
859.44s:  care that much. This is the difference of a mean reverting asset compared to a standard
866.32s:  growth asset of some sort. So to bring all of this back to the current chart that we're looking at,
873.68s:  I want you to take a look at every single time. Well, that's a terrible line. Every single time
881.28s:  price moves away from this midline. It pops up and then it goes back down. It pops up a whole lot
889.44s:  and then it goes back down. It goes below and then it goes back up.
894.24s:  The other thing I want you to notice is the slope of this channel. We have one endpoint here.
901.36s:  This is for a five year weekly chart. We have one endpoint here. So let's take a look at this from
909.28s:  this midpoint here is at 2865. Now this is after the COVID crash. So actually, let's zoom this out
916.72s:  even more. Let's do a 10 year and we'll clean those off. Let's use a 10 year chart. So 10
922.88s:  year chart, we have 20.7 here and then back here, we have 16 to 20.7. So it's four points. Let's
937.28s:  take a look at an example together. Now I want you as we're doing this, I want you to remember what
942.16s:  we're doing. We're understanding why volatility itself is an interesting asset class.
950.64s:  So the difference here from 16 call it to what is this 20 20.7. The difference between 16 and 20.7
963.44s:  is a 29.38% slope in terms of absolute return. That means from here to here, we move 29%
975.12s:  obviously it's a smaller asset, so a smaller move. Let's now keep the same chart 10 year monthly,
981.52s:  but let's go to SPX. What do you notice right out of the gate? What do you notice? There's a couple
988.40s:  things that should strike you as very different than what we just looked at.
998.56s:  This should help you understand what mean reversion actually is. Now, not to get too far off
1010.08s:  topic and get into the world of mean reversion too much, but the other thing we have to pay attention
1015.44s:  is time frame. When we're comparing long term mid term short term because if you look on a shorter
1022.72s:  term cycle, first let's start with the comparison we were doing in the other one. What's the
1027.92s:  difference between these two points? This is going to tell us the slope. This is going to tell us
1033.20s:  how much has this changed over the same reference period compared to the other. So it starts down here
1039.52s:  at 1645, let's log that here, 1645, and then it caps out here at 5197, 5197.
1053.68s:  It's a 216% return from here to here. Compare that to the 20% return that you saw
1066.40s:  in VIX here. The point that I'm making is that in a long term time frame, something like equities
1077.44s:  do not exhibit mean reversion. They exhibit drift, very different function.
1086.56s:  Mean reversion is essentially a compelling force where as things move out of a band,
1094.40s:  they are literally migrated back into a relation of the original band. In this case, the line of best
1102.80s:  fit of the standard deviation channel. You do not see that on SPX. Why does this matter? Why am I
1110.16s:  spending so much time at the beginning of this in terms of recapping this point? Why trade options?
1117.12s:  Why am I spending so much time on this point about mean reversion and volatility? It's because as
1122.32s:  an options trader, you literally gain access to one of the most predictable, the most predictable
1131.20s:  market functions that exist. Volatility in mean reversion. You get that right here. You do not get
1139.20s:  that with price. Price sometimes will go up a day in a row. Well, this is a month. Sometimes it'll
1145.04s:  go up a month in a row. Sometimes it'll go up seven months in a row. Then it'll be down one up,
1149.60s:  one up. It'll be all over the place. Now, one admin note. When we're talking about
1157.12s:  order term time frames, price in equities driven by sentiment can exhibit some elements of mean
1165.76s:  reversion. But it's not true mean reversion because the difference is exactly as I've painted for
1170.48s:  you here. This is appreciated over 200% over this time frame. There's nothing that's pulling it down
1177.28s:  every time it goes up. It's pulling it down a little bit, but then net net. It's moving up higher
1183.28s:  over time. That's called drift. When we look at something like VIX, it's the opposite. Literally
1189.60s:  VIX starts to pop a lot. It literally gets ripped back down. This is exactly why for those that were
1197.28s:  in some of the live streams throughout the past week is soon as VIX cracked above 20 literally
1202.48s:  recently. I had just spoke about trading it and trading it to the downside. I gave two different
1208.32s:  ways that a trader could trade it to the downside. I actually suggested people paper trade it.
1213.36s:  You could see how this works. You can either do it via short puts, which is a little anti-intuitive
1218.96s:  that's more of a volatility specific kind of approach. Or you could literally just trade it
1223.20s:  directionally. If you'll recall what I said is if you trade this directionally and you do something
1229.28s:  like buy puts, you're not going to make much money on it. Why did I say you're not going to make
1234.00s:  much money on it? Because everybody fucking knows this exact thing. But highly tradable.
1243.92s:  So going back to this, these are the reasons why options can be so interesting to trade and why
1254.88s:  they can be so lucrative. Okay, cool. Next one, key market participants. Last time we connected,
1260.88s:  we spoke about this graph art thing here. And the cliff notes version of this section and why it
1268.96s:  matters is because we are small fish in a big pond. We have to learn some of our advantages
1277.52s:  and how we can play those advantages. Because in general, we have very, very few of them.
1284.08s:  So some of the advantages of retail traders is that we're very small. It means that we can trade
1291.20s:  things that are literally too small for larger institutions to get into. Sometimes this is where
1296.48s:  you can find true edge because it can't be tackled by larger entities that have the resources that
1303.84s:  can see things that look really appealing there. But it's just too small. It just doesn't make
1308.08s:  sense for them anymore. The other thing is our ability to move around however we need to.
1319.84s:  And what I mean by that is we can be full long one day, full short the next day for a lot of
1325.20s:  people that kind of movement actually can lead to negative performance because we get whipsawed,
1329.84s:  we don't have a defined plan. But if you learn to master that, it allows you to move much more
1334.48s:  quickly with the market. You essentially are riding the tide, the coattails of the larger participants.
1341.04s:  That's the cool part about being a retail trader. Is there is a small niche for us that we can operate
1347.12s:  that even as a small retail trader, meaning you have sub 50 million dollars essentially,
1353.84s:  you have plenty of room to move around. Once you start getting above like 25, 50 mil, then you do
1359.76s:  start running into some positioning problems. You're kind of like the size of a small fund almost
1364.64s:  at that point. Really once you get over 100 mil. Okay, the next thing, when do we decide to trade an
1371.60s:  option versus the underlying? We already talked about options adding complexity. Options give us more
1377.76s:  things that we have to track and pay attention to. So when would we want to trade options as compared
1384.24s:  to the underlying? There are a few instances, and that's cool part. There's really not a whole lot
1388.56s:  of them. There's just a few instances. In general, equity outright is a simpler position.
1395.76s:  So if I wanted to trade options instead of equity outright, why might I do that? Well, one of the
1401.04s:  first reasons is for leverage. I can control. This is an old thing obviously before the split
1407.84s:  and Nvidia. But it's a good example because at the time that I made this, Nvidia was trading at
1414.08s:  11.05. And if I wanted to buy 100 shares of Nvidia, I need to put up 110K. The option equivalent at
1422.08s:  that point was 15K. That's leverage. I am controlling a much larger amount of money, which a much
1427.68s:  smaller amount of money. So that's one of the reasons why we might decide to trade options.
1433.04s:  The other thing is if we want to isolate other profit mechanisms, meaning if I want to trade
1438.16s:  something that's going sideways and actually capitalize on volatility, or if I just want to capitalize
1442.72s:  on theta and take in risk premium, that's another completely viable approach. So the main times we look
1450.40s:  to add options is when they make sense. The way they make sense is if we're doing things like this,
1457.68s:  that are specific to an asset like options and are not available in something like equities.
1464.40s:  I make this point because sometimes traders can make the mistake of automatically always defaulting
1473.60s:  to something like options. And that's not always the right answer. Because let's say that I have
1478.56s:  a portfolio. I don't really care how much money I'm using because it's a large enough portfolio.
1482.72s:  And I'm going to be controlled more by risk than position size. And I put on something. And
1489.84s:  when the trade goes on, I can either put it on with options or equities. Well, if I don't care
1494.64s:  how much money I'm using, and I don't want the leverage because I can put on the size that I want
1499.76s:  in the underlying itself, I just use the Delta one. I just use the underlying because now I don't
1504.72s:  have to deal with days to expiration. Now I don't have to deal with Vega as volatility changes
1509.20s:  and how that impacts the premium of my option. I don't have to deal with
1513.52s:  slowly dealing with theta decay as the premium is eroding out day over day of those options.
1519.44s:  So the point is just avoid automatically backing into something because there can be other periods,
1526.24s:  other approaches that might make sense. Okay, so now we can get into the session for today.
1532.80s:  Reading an options chain literally is going to be done as we go through this. So close that down.
1539.04s:  Open this one up. Here we are buying versus selling options. First thing, let me update our
1548.32s:  little timestamp here. We are at 26 minutes. This is for anybody that wants to rewatch these.
1557.28s:  So this will be buying versus selling. Okay, so when we look at an options chain, we know,
1567.52s:  let's grab a ticker. Let's grab something like so-fi. Just grab an a random ticker.
1576.24s:  And if we go into the options chain, if you guys have any questions on how to read this, let me know.
1580.80s:  The expectation is most people for this will at least be somewhat familiar with what this thing
1586.80s:  looks like and how to read it. So looking at the options chain, we can see that there's a bunch of
1594.72s:  different expressions, a bunch of different vultilities that are specific, all relative to the
1600.32s:  expiration duration itself. We can click in here and we can see all our different strike prices.
1605.44s:  We can see calls on the left, puts on the right, all that kind of stuff. So this number here is
1612.24s:  premium. What the fuck is premium? One of the things you'll notice in options trading in
1619.04s:  finance in general is we use a lot of stupid words to make shit more confusing than it needs to be.
1626.32s:  And this is an artifact of that. This is simply the value. This is equivalent of the stock price.
1632.72s:  This the premium is the stock price effective of an option itself. So this 17 call is currently bid
1643.28s:  at 132 offered at 135. So what this means is right now the most somebody is willing to buy it for
1651.60s:  as a dollar 32, the cheapest somebody is willing to sell it for as a dollar 35. Typically, what's
1657.92s:  resting here will be orders placed by market makers. They rest orders to provide liquidity. And they
1664.32s:  have specific regulations on how much they need to offer liquidity, meaning how often they have to
1670.72s:  have their quote machines turned on and provide those numbers. Now they can fuck with those numbers.
1675.28s:  They can make it really illiquid. They can make it really unattractive, but they still have to
1679.68s:  provide it. So we're faced with the choice. The first choice with every single option is do we want
1688.88s:  to buy it or do we want to sell it? The way we answer that is pretty simple. And on the slide,
1697.52s:  we're going to go through a series of decisions together. Then I want to give you some considerations
1704.08s:  to keep in mind as you apply this practically. And then at the end, I want to walk through
1710.96s:  actually structuring a few trades with you in making the decision together live on current names
1717.20s:  that are happening right now if we might want to buy or sell. So first, let's start with understanding
1724.32s:  the differences between buying and selling premium. The first thing is we know, hopefully we should
1732.48s:  know. Let me grab one. I need a, you know, like a peacock. I got to be able to draw. I need
1740.08s:  this up here so I could draw. Let me draw. Here we go. We're ready to rock.
1744.16s:  Beautiful. Grab my notepad. So the first thing we have to identify is that we have an options
1759.84s:  contract. And we know for every single options contract, there are two people.
1771.60s:  Fire and a seller. Typically, there's a facilitating party in the center of this,
1782.24s:  which is a market maker. The main point I want you to take away from this section is that there are
1788.96s:  two components, a buyer and a seller. Every single contract needs a buyer and a seller. Think of
1797.36s:  your insurance for anything that you have insurance on. There are two parties to your insurance.
1804.96s:  The first party to your insurance, this is actually better done here. The first party to your
1811.60s:  insurance is you. You want insurance. You're going to buy insurance. You're the first party. The second
1818.24s:  party is the insurance provider. Whoever the agency is, all state, state, farm, whoever you're
1824.48s:  going through for your insurance. One entity is selling the insurance. The other entity is buying
1833.44s:  the insurance. That insurance has a contract. There are different rules that apply to the insurance
1840.48s:  that typically amount to how can we not pay you but take your money, you know, standard insurance
1847.28s:  shit. That's an insurance contract. It's the same thing in options. In options, there's a contract
1856.08s:  with two components, two people that are tied to that contract. Let's start now with understanding
1866.88s:  the differences between those two perspectives. I'm grabbing an overview somewhere.
1883.04s:  Here we go. We're not going to go through this whole thing. It doesn't really matter. I want you
1889.76s:  specifically focus on this section. This section here gives you an outline of what things look like
1901.20s:  for the buyer of an option as compared to a seller. Again, just keep the insurance thing in the back
1907.20s:  of your brain because that's what it is. If you think about the purchaser of an insurance,
1913.04s:  they're paying a premium. I'm giving you money. The deal is if there's a covered loss,
1922.32s:  you cover the loss, the point and why people buy insurance beyond the insurance that's just
1930.80s:  literally legally mandated, it's to reduce severity. What that means is I might pay two
1937.60s:  200 bucks a month, whatever it is for my insurance. I just pay that 200 bucks every month. I
1943.76s:  can fit it into the budget, losing the 200 bucks isn't fun, but I can stomach it. It's okay.
1949.28s:  If I have a covered loss, let's say that there's unfortunately a car accident and the car is
1953.68s:  totaled. Let's say I'm found at fault in some capacity. Maybe it wasn't my fault at all,
1959.84s:  but somebody hits my car, totals, it drives away. We have no idea who they are.
1964.48s:  Well, then me as the consumer, as the end point, the buyer of the insurance, well, I'm like,
1968.88s:  shit, I don't want to go buy a $60,000 car. That's a lot of money to come up with at once to replace
1975.04s:  this thing. I don't want to pick up a car payment that's going to be double whatever my prices,
1978.40s:  which, fun fact, offshoot, you should never have a car payment. You should never have a car
1983.60s:  payment. One of the worst possible kinds of payments you can have. It's dumb. You don't have a
1987.76s:  car payment just by a car that fits within your budget. That aside, you don't want to come up with
1994.72s:  the money out of pocket. So that's the point of insurance. I pay $200 every month to make sure
2002.96s:  that if some shit happens, I'm covered and it reduces my overall severity. Even if in the aggregate,
2012.96s:  I pay more than the value of the car over the entire life cycle of the car.
2017.76s:  I'm okay with that. And the reason why I'm okay with that is because it reduces the severity
2022.32s:  so that I'm not stuck having to pay $60,000 at one point in time. So
2030.64s:  the buyer receives something. Now, the difference in the departure from options versus insurance
2041.36s:  is the way settlement occurs because in options, the buyer, if it's an American style option,
2050.64s:  they can exercise whenever they want, even if it doesn't make sense, they can.
2059.44s:  So a big, big difference in something to be aware of in options, especially specifically American
2064.96s:  style option is that they can be exercised at any point in time. The seller is to be aware of that
2070.80s:  because you can be on the hook to deliver whatever your end of the bargain is, whether you sold a call
2077.28s:  or sold a put two different scenarios. And you can see those down here, I purposely give you,
2083.60s:  and I recommend grab a screenshot. I actually think what's better is you make your own, the process
2088.32s:  of making your own is valuable. But this here just gives you a quick little cheat sheet on how these
2094.96s:  things move with respect to stock price volatility and then opening closing transactions. And who's
2102.40s:  on the hook to do what? But what you'll notice is that the seller is on the hook to do some shit.
2109.20s:  If you sell a call, you're on the hook to buy, I'm sorry, you're on the hook to sell shares.
2116.08s:  So if you sell a, if you sell a call, you're on the hook to sell somebody shares at a set price,
2121.12s:  the strike price. And then if you sell the put, you're on the hook to buy shares.
2129.60s:  One thing to know is that the majority of options are closed before expiration. So the majority
2138.48s:  of instances will not include these transactions here. And it's because in general, they're just
2144.08s:  inefficient. It doesn't make sense. And we can get into that at another point in time. But the
2149.68s:  way to think of it is when we talk about the premium of an option, the premium of an option has
2155.60s:  a couple key components. One of them is time value. When you exercise your option, whether you bought a
2161.20s:  caller or put and you exercise it, you give up your time value that otherwise you could recover.
2167.52s:  So that's why in general, it doesn't make sense. Now again, there's nuances to this that we can
2172.40s:  get into it. Some okay. So to recap what we just talked about, we now understand the perspective
2179.44s:  of buyers. We now understand the perspective of sellers. We now understand that people that sell
2185.20s:  calls have an obligation to sell shares at a certain price. We now know that people that sell
2191.12s:  puts have the obligation to buy shares at a certain price. We also now know that in general,
2197.52s:  it doesn't make sense to exercise the options. So what does that tell you? It tells us that most
2202.32s:  of us are trading the options contract itself without necessarily why going into why
2213.84s:  got to real learn says, Oh, I understand why selling puts can be bullish. Bingo. There you go.
2218.08s:  That's exactly correct. So this becomes a useful exercise. And we can sell options by options,
2225.76s:  depending on what we're trying to do. But most of us are simply trading the contract. And we're
2230.56s:  using those unique aspects of an options contract that we talked about earlier as the rationale
2236.32s:  for trading and options contract. So quick, pause here. After we just talked a whole lot
2245.04s:  about premium of an option, buying, selling. Are there any questions? And in the meantime,
2251.28s:  I'm going to update our timestamps. So premium,
2258.64s:  buying, selling, settlement. And that's pretty good. Any questions on any of this stuff?
2270.40s:  I made like a liquid IV, but I've watered it down too much. So it just kind of tastes like
2282.88s:  slightly, slightly off flavored water. Lauren says I have questions, but I think they might be
2290.96s:  answered later looking at your sidebar. Sure. Well, let's get over to that now because that's the
2296.32s:  next step. The next step in this process is comparing buying versus selling options kind of
2304.72s:  line by line. So let's do that now. So we're at 3830. And we are talking about combining or comparing
2314.00s:  to carrying buying versus selling option. And then don't worry because at the end, I'm literally
2322.32s:  going to give you like a specific framework. And it's not like Eric's secret framework. There's
2327.60s:  nothing secret about this shit. It's just to give you a way to think about this so that it at
2333.04s:  least makes sense. Now, I'm going to slide this over just a little bit so that my head isn't
2338.64s:  directly over this. I think it's good now. And let's kick off. So the difference between buying
2345.52s:  and selling, we're going to start with the entering transaction. Pretty simple. When we're buying
2351.44s:  something, we're buying to open. When we're selling something, we're selling to open BTO, STO.
2359.52s:  Now, what this means is if I'm buying to open, it means that I'm giving money. And after I give
2366.16s:  the money, I have an open position. Selling to open means I am taking money. I am receiving money.
2373.04s:  We call it a credit. I get a credit. And then I have an open position. When we're buying, it is a
2378.88s:  debit. So the inverse is the inverse. Pretty simple. Probably can move through this part a little
2386.24s:  quickly because I don't think this should be a big shock. We're just going to do the opposite
2390.80s:  of what we did to get in. And again, for those that are wondering, this is how the majority of
2397.60s:  options contracts are going to be settled is through this transaction process of buying and selling
2403.20s:  just like that. Okay. Risk profile. Now we start getting into the differences. The differences
2409.68s:  that matter a lot. So one of the first differences here is you'll notice that if I buy premium,
2418.08s:  I have defined risk. That means the most I can lose is whatever I bought it for. And if I sell
2425.36s:  premium, I have undefined risk. That means I can lose a non-symmetric amount to whatever I
2433.44s:  collected up front. So let's take a quick look at what this can look like. We'll stay in so
2437.60s:  far just because we're here. Let's keep it on the 17 call just because and let's take a look at
2441.84s:  buying and selling the same call. And let's do... Yep, this is fine. So let's get rid of this. I'm
2453.36s:  actually going to do the opposite trade as well in the same spot. Let's delete this. So it's out
2457.92s:  of the way. And let's take a look first at buying it. This is called a risk profile. So risk
2463.20s:  profile, you can plot this for yourself. You literally can make this in Excel. It's super simple.
2467.52s:  It just looks across different strike prices and then different PNLs based on... I'm sorry, this is
2472.88s:  in strike prices. This is prices of the underlying. And it looks at different PNLs at different values
2479.20s:  of the underlying. So here, notice two things. The first thing is the loss component, which is what's
2486.96s:  below zero on the y-axis here. And you can see that it levels off. It's flat. That means once you get
2494.48s:  to that point, that's all you got. And again, think of it logically. If I pay $100 for something,
2503.04s:  that's what I give up. That $100. Even though if, let's say, I'm flipping shoes, I know people do
2509.28s:  that, which is just such a crazy thing to make, because I don't know anything about shoes. But
2514.56s:  somebody will pay for shoes. You give money upfront and then you get the shoes. And then the idea
2520.24s:  is that the shoes might be worth more if you're good at this. So you're given the money upfront,
2525.20s:  you get the shoes. And then later, you're going to try to give the shoes to somebody and collect more
2529.76s:  money. It's the same thing that's going on here. But if you buy those shoes and then those shoes turn
2534.64s:  out to be worthless because they're fake, the most you can lose is whatever you paid upfront for those
2539.92s:  shoes. Same thing here. So when you're buying an option, the most you can lose is what you pay for
2544.40s:  the option. The inverse occurs when we sell options. You'll notice that if I squish this down,
2552.24s:  and we go further and further and further and further and further out, and we see so far, I
2557.12s:  imagine I've never actually done this. I'm curious how far this goes. 900 that this is actually
2563.20s:  kind of fun. I'm not going to lie. 41 million. It's got to stop at some point.
2570.64s:  600 million, 30 billion. I did not think that this would go into the billions. This is crazy.
2578.16s:  If this goes into trillions, I'll stop after trillions because I cannot believe that this is
2589.52s:  still going. Oh, no, it's stuck. I think we're stuck. No, we're still in the billions. This is
2599.92s:  crazy. Okay. Well, anyways, the point hopefully is proved because now it can't even calculate it.
2609.44s:  It literally just says infinite. So what this is actually showing you though is you have unlimited
2616.80s:  risk in the direction that it goes against you. Now it's not truly unlimited risk. It's just
2624.96s:  really big risk. It's not truly unlimited risk because sooner or later, as weird as this is
2633.20s:  going to sound, sooner or later, the world literally runs out of resources. Right? There's only
2641.84s:  so much value on planet earth of things at a given point in time. This is theoretical and conversation,
2648.72s:  but I want the point to be clear. So what that means is even though we can just chart this of going
2655.04s:  into the hundreds of billions of dollars in terms of stock price, that's not in terms of market
2660.72s:  cap. That's in terms of stock price. There comes to be a natural cap in terms of literally what
2667.04s:  code, what is the total amount of value that literally exists today? So just be aware of that. It's
2674.24s:  the same thing to the downside. When we sell an option like if we sell a put, we typically say that
2679.84s:  the risk profile is undefined, which is always comical to me. It's actually defined, right? A stock
2686.40s:  can go to zero. That's defined, but we refer to it as undefined risk. The reason why we refer to it as
2695.60s:  undefined risk is that it can go to those extremes and it can go as far along those extremes technically
2703.28s:  as it wants. Now the reality is obviously that's not how price works. It's not very frequent that you
2709.44s:  see stocks go to zero. And I've never seen a hundred million dollar stock price for a stock, right?
2717.84s:  So there becomes natural limitations to it. But the point I'm making is that defined versus undefined.
2726.48s:  A travel says when you sell an option, don't you also know the max you can lose as long as you do
2731.76s:  not do naked? For example, on selling a put is the strike minus premium received.
2740.80s:  There's not a max loss. That's incorrect. So travel says so it is undefined, but there is a max loss.
2747.28s:  Nope, that's incorrect. What you're calculating there is your break even point, which actually is
2753.44s:  a couple away from here. But say, for example, you sell, what did you do? You use an example of
2760.64s:  selling a put. If you sell a put and you have your strike price less the credit received,
2767.44s:  that's just giving you your break even point. You still have undefined risk of that option.
2772.96s:  Technically, technically undefined risk as I was talking about before, the stock can only go to zero.
2778.00s:  Travel says no max. I can lose because I get assigned and the underlying goes to zero.
2791.36s:  Correct. That's literally the point I was just making is that we refer to it as undefined.
2797.36s:  But on that option, it still has technically undefined risk, even for a short put to your point,
2804.72s:  it's defined down at zero. And same thing like I was just making the point of going all the
2810.32s:  way to the upside, making the hypothetical that so far is trading at $100 million in terms of stock
2816.24s:  price. We've never seen anything even close to that. You literally run out of resources literally
2822.32s:  on earth to call the value infinite of any stock. Any stock is going to have a cap somewhere.
2832.32s:  Now the commensurate value can slowly rise and whatnot, but the value literally the value on
2838.32s:  earth is not infinite. So the main point is when we're referring to short options as undefined,
2846.24s:  we're talking about the severity. That's the primary point. So even in the example of a short put,
2852.24s:  it technically speaking has undefined risk down to zero. Just as any of these stocks have undefined
2858.96s:  risk up to whatever price it can go to, which leads to the profile, which is the inverse.
2865.92s:  So the reward is what you make and we just saw this on those options. So if we buy an option,
2871.76s:  we have undefined profit, but to find risk. If we sell options, we have undefined risk, but to find
2877.12s:  profit. Begs the question. We'll fuck with do this. Why would I do this? Why on earth would I accept
2888.16s:  unlimited risk, but limited profit from just a logical perspective that in and of itself
2898.00s:  makes no fucking sense. It makes absolutely no sense to do something like that.
2906.08s:  But there are specific reasons why it actually does make sense in practice, which we'll talk about.
2915.60s:  So let's take a look at the next one. This is one of those reasons. Because when you buy premium,
2925.04s:  you need the stock to move. The stock has to move. And you also need the stock to move
2935.52s:  in your direction, has to move in your direction. If it doesn't, you will slowly start losing money.
2943.92s:  So if we go back to this example, let's go back to this long option, you'll notice that there are
2948.48s:  two lines purple and blue. Purple represents today. Blue represents at expiration. Notice how the
2956.96s:  purple line right now is much higher than the blue line. Why is the purple line higher than the
2961.68s:  blue line? Because of x, intrinsic value, time value. What ends up happening is with current price
2971.04s:  right now. If I buy this option right now, the 17 call, and I buy it with the stock price at
2977.60s:  1657, you'll notice that I need this to move in order for me to make anything at expiration.
2989.44s:  You need the stock price above your strike price plus the premium to make any money with a long call.
2998.96s:  What you don't need is the stock price above your strike price in order to make money before that time.
3012.08s:  What this means is right now the strike price is 17 and paying a dollar 35.
3019.68s:  Strike price is 17. Stock is at 1657. Let's zoom this in a little bit so that you can see a little
3026.00s:  easier. Let's pretend that the stock goes to 1675. Stock moves to 1675. That's not my strike price yet.
3037.84s:  But I will make money. So if I go to 1675, I make $7.77 today. That doesn't include the
3049.68s:  passage of time yet. That is if it happens today. So this is to short circuit a really common
3057.44s:  misconception of people who buy options that think the underlying has to go past your strike in
3066.48s:  order to make money and it doesn't. It does only at expiration. Before expiration, I'm showing you
3075.12s:  right now an example where that is not the case. Now this is a really small case of it because
3082.32s:  the numbers are so close 1657 to 17. So let me show you another example quickly that will hopefully
3088.88s:  make this point even more clear. Let's pick something that's super far out of the money. Let's pick
3092.48s:  the 25s. Doesn't have to go to 25 before you make money. So my strike is all the way over here at 25.
3101.20s:  What do you notice about that purple line before we get there? So the stock can rally to 20.
3112.32s:  I would pay 17 cents or $17 for this option right now looking at the 21 Feb 25 call and I would make
3120.64s:  $55. This is where you see people placing and placing options trades and saying I made 5800 percent.
3131.36s:  That's going to be tied to a smaller cheap out of the money option that compounded a lot that
3137.36s:  compounding is due to gamma which we'll talk about later. So let's go back here and let's take a look
3154.00s:  at the selling premium component that has that built in buffer. If I sell a call and right now
3163.20s:  spot price is 1657, what do you notice that's different than if I sell that call versus buying it?
3171.20s:  The stock cannot move at all and if it doesn't move before we get into expiration,
3180.48s:  I make the maximum amount of money I can on this trade if it doesn't move at all.
3185.92s:  The other thing you'll notice is that even if it moves against me a little bit, I can still make money,
3193.84s:  won't be max profit, but I can still make money. This is a big difference between selling and buying
3201.12s:  and this is one of the benefits of selling is you have a built in buffer to be wrong. But
3209.36s:  notice the difference here. Take a look at the purple line to the blue line. At this point right here
3215.76s:  at 1740, that means that the underlying would have rallied against me if I sell a call it's bearish,
3223.52s:  so the rally would be against the position. It would rally against the position about one point.
3231.04s:  That's still, if you look at the blue line, still in profit, but today it's not. I would be showing
3238.48s:  the loss of $44. Even though if I held that position and I took it into expiration, it would be
3245.36s:  worth this case 95. I would literally make money even though the underlying moved against me.
3251.92s:  So that's another one of the benefits of selling. Okay, relationship with volatility,
3257.76s:  really, really simple. This is the standard relationship of long options versus short options.
3262.80s:  Long options, enjoy expanding volatility and shrinking volatility decreases the extrinsic value,
3270.96s:  decreases the value of the option. So to make this point, I don't know, I honestly don't know the
3277.44s:  general understanding of most of the people that are in here. So I'm going to draw this out really
3281.68s:  quick so that hopefully will make sense. So if we have, let me get this keyboard out of the way.
3292.24s:  If we have a premium, so let's say it's a dollar premium and we break this premium out,
3297.36s:  it will have intrinsic and extrinsic value.
3308.40s:  Let's say that this option is out of the money.
3312.80s:  That means that there is zero intrinsic value, nada. And then extrinsic value is broken down
3321.76s:  into two sub components. I'm
3327.84s:  and vol.
3331.20s:  The reason why there are two sub components in here is volatility lives essentially,
3338.08s:  volatility essentially lives in time. But there's separate factors because time is linear.
3348.56s:  I know the days to expiration. I know the expiration of every single option out there.
3357.12s:  So I inherently know how much time I should decay out per day based on the time input itself.
3365.92s:  It's linear time is linear. The non-linear component to this is volatility. Because if something is
3373.68s:  more volatile, it's more likely to have bigger moves. If something is less volatile,
3381.52s:  it has smaller moves. So then the value of that option is different.
3388.88s:  Lawrence says, I thought volatility made profits from call options go down. It depends on which
3393.68s:  side of the trade your own. So it inherently does not do that. Volatility impacts options
3401.20s:  like this. Let me hide this so it's not your way.
3409.92s:  Here. Notice how there's no catty corner relationship here, meaning it impacts one call or put,
3417.52s:  depending on what you've done differently. What it is entirely based on is if you're long or short
3426.72s:  the option. So get rid of this component for now. Just make all this go away in your brain.
3439.84s:  I didn't mean to do that. I thought there was like a fill color. That's not it either.
3446.08s:  What I was trying to do is hide this. But what I want you to think about is all options. Every single one
3453.36s:  of them call, put all of them. All options across the board, all of them. Their premium will go up
3464.16s:  if volatility goes up. All of them calls and puts. If volatility goes down, all options,
3472.16s:  calls or puts, the premium will contract all of them across the board. They will be obviously different
3480.32s:  levels of severity, different scale, depending on the other Greeks of the option. But it affects them
3487.68s:  it affects them all in this way. So now it depends if this change in volatility if it helps or hurts
3499.76s:  my position is if I've bought or sold the option. Because remember, if I buy something, I want it to
3508.80s:  be worth more in the future. So if I buy a call or if I buy a put, volatility expanding helps me.
3517.92s:  My option is now worth more. It's the inverse if I sell. But I'm selling options. I want to sell
3523.52s:  something high and then buy it back to cover lower cheaper. So if volatility goes up, that hurts my
3532.08s:  position. Whether it's a color put, if I sold it, it's going to hurt me. So the way to think about
3538.16s:  volatility's impact on options is think of it in terms of the impact on all options. There's new
3544.40s:  wants, right? We're obviously talking about things in a vacuum. We're talking about no changes in time
3550.24s:  and all that kind of stuff. There's layers that will factor on to it. But Cedrus Parabus, everything
3554.88s:  else remaining the same. If we move this component, that's what you will see. So good question.
3563.12s:  Okay. Let us continue down. Capital requirement is different. Whether you buy or sell premium.
3572.96s:  Capital requirement when you buy is whatever you paid. You're going to pay that out of your cash
3577.36s:  and sweep. When you sell premium, you're actually going to collect money upfront that's going to go
3582.88s:  into your cash and sweep. However, there's going to be a margin requirement. The margin requirement
3589.76s:  can be different. If you're in a cash security account and you try to sell a call, it won't let
3594.80s:  you because you can't cash secure a short call. There's no cash securing it. It's undefined.
3601.76s:  If you want to sell a put, you can cash secure a put because you can take a Simon of the underlying
3611.20s:  and hold the equity itself and then your max risk and the equity is the value of the equity.
3617.12s:  So a little bit different. Now, in the context of like a regulation T margin account or
3622.72s:  a portfolio margin account, they calculate the margin requirement differently. The way to think
3628.64s:  about margin requirements is it's essentially your broker's method to put the risk of the position
3635.68s:  onto you. They're not going to take the risk for you. So what that means is they're very guarded
3640.96s:  against people having a bunch of options positions on because if there's some sort of big move
3646.64s:  that goes against you and you lose on a bunch of these options positions and you don't have the
3650.88s:  money in the account for it, they've now just taken your risk because they still have to make
3655.52s:  that position whole. So that's why when markets become more volatile, typically speaking, you will
3661.76s:  see margin requirements go up because your broker is essentially saying, I see more risk out there
3668.08s:  today. I'm not going to take that risk for you. You're going to have to put some more money in this
3671.76s:  account to cover that risk. This is what we call a margin call to satisfy a margin call. You have
3677.76s:  to add money into the account. Otherwise, there's a chance your broker will start liquidating your
3682.88s:  positions for you and that's to reduce the broker's risk. Okay. Greeks, this one, I'm a little hesitant
3693.28s:  to put up, but we'll see how this goes for you guys. When you're buying premium, you're going to
3701.04s:  be short theta long game a long row. Feel good? That makes sense. Partially joking, but partially not.
3715.76s:  We'll go through them all.
3723.36s:  There are a bunch of different Greeks. People have so many misconceptions about the Greeks and we're here
3739.92s:  to clarify as many as we can. So let me update our little timestamp here so this will be
3744.32s:  the Greek impacts you buying or selling. And we are at 10230. Beautiful. Right on schedule.
3755.92s:  Okay.
3758.32s:  So let's take a look at some examples. Notice how I'm not saying if your long calls, long puts,
3765.44s:  short calls, short puts, I'm talking about it across all options here. Let's keep that in mind.
3773.60s:  So let's get an example going. Buy, buy to open, a call or a put, literally a call or a put,
3783.44s:  it doesn't matter either one. If I buy one of these, we already know that when you buy an option,
3794.72s:  you're gaining leverage, you have defined risk, you have undefined profit. That's a really solid
3803.36s:  place to be for an investment. So there are compensatory elements to this that makes this not the
3812.88s:  Goldilocks scenario that otherwise this would be. If there were not drawbacks to this, there's nobody
3819.12s:  that wouldn't do this. One of those drawbacks is Theta decay.
3828.88s:  So Theta decay simply tells us Theta itself tells us the rate of decay of an options premium
3839.52s:  per one day passing. So options decay. The reason why that matters is because let's take it back to
3848.80s:  basics. If I bought those sneakers and let's say that those sneakers had a magical spell on them
3856.64s:  where at the end of one week, the sneakers aren't there anymore. They've fucking decay away into
3861.92s:  nothing. And my goal is to offload these sneakers super fast because I don't want, I paid $100
3868.48s:  for those sneakers. I'm going to try to sell them for more because I think they're worth more.
3872.48s:  But if I hold on to them for too long, they're not going to be worth anything. That kind of sucks.
3876.96s:  So to short circuit, this magical sneaker scenario, I'm going to try to move on them quickly.
3884.32s:  I'm going to try to sell them off quickly and move on with my day. And do the human thing of
3891.84s:  give somebody else the problem. All right, cool. Theta decay is the same for options.
3899.20s:  Options or contracts, all of these contracts will conclude at some point. So if we take a look,
3907.12s:  here, let's take a look at a couple scenarios. These are out of the money options. Let's take a look
3914.80s:  at the out of the money, 30 delta option here in SoFi. If we take a look at the 30 delta put,
3921.36s:  it's bid 80 offered at 82. Now, let's go into zero days to expiration. Let's see if we can find
3928.64s:  the 30 delta. It won't be there technically. Since it landed right at 1650, it's actually kind of
3936.00s:  funny. It's quoting a penny. But notice the value of all these options. Zero gone. No value left,
3944.32s:  decayed away out of there. So when you are buying options, you're paying money upfront. And we know
3955.36s:  that they're stated decay. Dated decay is the decay of the extrinsic value of the options.
3963.20s:  So what ends up happening is as you bought this thing for a dollar, if nothing else changes,
3968.64s:  but time passes, it's worth a little bit less each day. Theta is the Greek that tells you how much less.
3977.44s:  So that you know,
3978.40s:  make sense so far. I want to isolate this theta component. So theta decay negatively impacts holders.
3998.56s:  The inverse for sellers, delta open, all are put. Yay, theta decay.
4010.56s:  Now, let's talk about a really common misconception for sellers. Sellers, a lot of sellers will
4019.92s:  mistakenly tell you that their edge is theta. There is exactly zero edge in theta. Theta will not
4033.76s:  provide you in ounce of edge. Theta is a linear metric that is known. There's no edge in it.
4044.24s:  The reason why they say theta is their edge is because they collect money and they think falsely
4053.44s:  that that provides them a bait in edge. The way to think about in edge in the market is that if there's
4064.16s:  any sort of edge that's easily accessible by everybody, there's no edge there. It's not a thing.
4075.04s:  So there are risk premiums. And theta does not even provide you a risk premium out right. It's
4084.64s:  the volatility component that provides you a risk premium. We can get into risk premiums in
4089.60s:  efficiencies versus edge. Don't even worry about that right now. The way to summarize this
4095.36s:  component is sellers benefit from the decaying of an option. Because again, if I sold something for
4104.80s:  $100 and then I'm going to look to buy it back, I want to buy it back cheaper so that decay helps
4113.44s:  my position as a seller. Okay, so let me take a pause there. And I would love to hear if that
4123.84s:  so far makes sense. Are we on board? Any questions about the difference between these? Why it is what
4132.48s:  it is? Why the behavior is what it is specifically for this Greek? And then, okay, great. So now let's
4140.64s:  get into gamma. Let me update my little thing. We're at 10902. Oh, two. Let's get it. Gamma. Gamma is the rate
4155.92s:  of change of delta. So let's go back to basics here. Every time that we do these, I specifically want
4166.56s:  you to get into the mental habit of taking it back to the basics of something. So let's grab
4176.56s:  the options chain. And let me grab this again. I'll just clear all that off.
4185.12s:  So let's go further out in time here. And here. What happens
4196.64s:  if I buy this option and the price goes up? Well, if the price goes up, my option right now is
4210.40s:  that a 51 delta, it will appreciate by 11 cents. This column here is gamma. Gamma represents
4221.28s:  this movement. If things start to move, we know that that can impact volatility. That can
4231.84s:  ultimately benefit our position. So typically speaking, let's use a simpler example, not of single
4242.32s:  options, but let's use a long straddle to show you how the gamma component works.
4253.04s:  What do you notice about this straddle? Does it care if price goes up or if price goes down?
4262.56s:  Based on this risk profile, does it have a preference?
4274.40s:  Next time I am not watering down the liquid IV, not terrible, but it just doesn't really taste like
4281.60s:  much. It's kind of boring. Risa says, no, that's correct. Lauren, where you at? Lauren,
4288.40s:  talk to me. Why do you think yes? Why? Yes, Lauren, Lauren, I don't know if you know this. You're
4296.48s:  the proxy for the group. So yes or no, you tell me the green line cares. Lauren, you've got to be
4316.72s:  fucking with me right now. That's, I think that has to be what's currently happening. That's the
4324.96s:  only rational explanation for this so far. There's not a fucking green line on here, Lauren. Are you
4336.48s:  colorblind? Are you actually colorblind? Because if so, that's colorblindness, I feel like is one of
4342.32s:  those afflictions that's so fun to make fun of, like you can make fun of somebody's disability
4349.04s:  if they're colorblind. It's not like making fun of somebody that was born without a leg. Like,
4353.68s:  if you can't see color, sucks to be you, but that's also one of those ones that you're just going
4357.60s:  to be made fun of for. Rightfully so. So joking aside, what this is showing you is that it really
4366.24s:  doesn't care which way it goes. It technically has a slight preference based on underlying price
4371.44s:  and where the strike of the straddle is technically speaking, right? Because this is the 17
4378.40s:  strike. So technically speaking, but if I grab the 16 and a half, which is actually exactly where
4385.76s:  it landed, it doesn't have one that's, let me see if there's one of them in here. Here we go. This
4389.52s:  will be a better example. Yeah, there you go. So this one doesn't really care which way it goes
4399.68s:  because we're buying it at the money straddle. What I'm showing you is that your long options
4403.20s:  right now. We don't care which way this goes. That's why this position is long gamma because as long
4414.08s:  as it moves, that's all we want. We just want it to move up or down. Don't care. Just want it to move.
4422.24s:  Gamma helps us understand the rates of change of delta. Gamma is the ultimate way that this
4429.36s:  ends up making money is if it gets in a accommodating move big enough to overcome ad expiration to be
4437.52s:  outside the break even points before expiration doesn't care as long as it moves either way doesn't
4442.80s:  care it off. So this is why buying premium depending on the premium will be long gamma in some
4452.96s:  capacity. Now it's a little bit different because if you use single options, you can have single
4460.16s:  option positions that benefit from favorable gamma moves. So it's a little bit of nuance in there.
4469.28s:  The main thing to think about is gamma, like if gamma expands or if gamma starts to increase,
4476.72s:  that means that volatility is increasing which feeds back into the options. Now the actual
4482.32s:  impact of selling a single option, buying a single option, not all gamma would help a position.
4490.48s:  When we say long gamma, we're talking about all of gamma increasing, not the change of gamma as
4498.24s:  the underlying moves. Let me clarify that point a little bit. What ends up happening is this
4506.56s:  number here gamma represents the rate of change of delta and gamma helps us understand how volatile
4514.32s:  something is. If we're trading something that's a little bit more volatile, you will find that the
4521.44s:  gamma numbers as a raw number, the gamma will be higher and then the gamma as a relative number to
4527.20s:  the price of the underlying will be higher because it's expected to move more. That again is
4534.00s:  essentially a proxy for volatility. If gamma starts to increase, it means volatility is increasing.
4539.12s:  If gamma is contracting, that means volatility is decreasing. That means that the overall
4544.32s:  values of the options will be decreasing. Now the reason why it's kind of nuanced and there's
4550.32s:  two levels to think about this one is because if I buy this call here, that means net net, I'm long gamma.
4559.60s:  But if this moves against me by a dollar here, like goes this direction, well, gamma is actually
4569.20s:  hurting me in that case. That's not good. So two different ways to think of it. The way I want you to
4576.80s:  think of it for the context of this conversation here is long gamma as a general metric across
4584.72s:  the volatility surface, across aspirations, across strikes. Now, row.
4590.88s:  Row is actually really easy, believe it or not. And row doesn't impact stuff that much. So this
4595.84s:  one should be pretty easy to understand. Row tells us how much options, the rate of change
4605.76s:  of an options premium relative to changes in interest rates. Interest rates matter across
4614.08s:  different time frames. So one of the really common misconceptions you'll see is people will say like,
4620.16s:  oh, this is a direct reflection of the federal funds rate or the sofa rate or things like that.
4627.20s:  And it's not. It is tied to it for sure because both of those rates will impact the broader rate
4634.24s:  environment. But it's different for different aspirations. So something like a sofa rate is
4640.80s:  pretty short term in nature. If I'm trading something like this, that's 364 days out. The overnight
4651.28s:  rate is important. But there's a different rate that's appropriate for this duration as compared
4657.36s:  to a really short term duration. So just think of it this way again, across all options, just like
4664.40s:  we looked at volatility from before. Remember how we said volatility, whether it's a color of put,
4669.20s:  doesn't matter across all options if volatility goes up, it makes options more expensive.
4675.44s:  So then that would naturally benefit buyers and naturally hurt sellers. It's literally the same
4680.48s:  exact thing with row. If interest rates go up, options become more expensive. That's immediately
4686.88s:  going to benefit buyers. It's immediately going to hurt sellers. So gamma and row, gamma is a
4695.76s:  little more confusing row, I think is pretty straightforward. Okay. Time to take a pause before we
4703.36s:  get into a little bit of Prak app. We have a little longer left. I'm not in a big rush and I want
4708.00s:  to make sure that you guys get this stuff. So let's do any questions on this stuff first. Okay.
4715.20s:  Reese, oh no, your answer and somebody which is good.
4717.68s:  EHodge says gamma is how much the delta of a contract moves per dollar. Yep.
4724.96s:  That's exactly correct. We typically refer to it as a one point move. It's just like a dollar is fine.
4732.08s:  The reason why we call it a one point move is because there are some things that move in handles
4736.96s:  like options on futures and stuff, which is just a little bit different. But yeah, it's per dollar
4742.08s:  move. That's fine. You'll also heard it referred to as one point move, which is really annoying,
4750.08s:  by the way, because when we're talking about points in relation to percentages, it's different
4755.76s:  than like a one point move in relation to the underlying, which would be synonymous with the dollar
4760.88s:  as compared to percentages of percentages. You know, just another little fun quirk to
4767.04s:  completely annoy the living shared out of everybody trying to learn this stuff.
4772.08s:  Thanks, markets. Cool. So it seems like so far we're good. Let's talk about
4784.00s:  two things now. These should be pretty quick. Some costly misconceptions and then
4791.76s:  making the decision on when to buy versus when to start. I'm going to update our time stamps,
4798.16s:  costs, costly misconceptions, of buying, uh, pieces like type over here, buying for selling.
4812.24s:  And yeah, we'll just start there.
4818.88s:  Beautiful. Okay. So the decision between buying and selling
4826.72s:  becomes really simple once we understand the individual inputs. One of the big mistakes
4833.20s:  that people make is before they even start looking at what they're doing, they immediately try to
4839.52s:  answer should I buy or sell? And that approach doesn't really make sense because we need more
4846.96s:  information before we make the choice to buy or sell. Now there's another video. I'm going to link to
4853.92s:  it in the chat there and then I'll also link to it in the time stamps when they come out.
4861.36s:  But that video is literally, it's a 10 minute video or so that directly compares buying versus
4867.20s:  selling across all different parameters that we're going to talk about some now. But let's start
4873.92s:  here. One is not better than the other. There's a reason why that is such an important point. One
4886.00s:  is not better than the other. The reason why one is not better than the other is because if that were
4892.48s:  the case, um, it's time for the dude to grab his dinner. Give me one sec. Let me pop the door.
4903.84s:  It's funny because he knows as soon as I pop that door that it's like his dinner time, he gets
4918.56s:  out of here like a bad out of hell. So if one was better than the other, why would anybody do the other?
4926.56s:  This is a really, really, really common misconception. And it's a common misconception that I notice
4935.36s:  definitely impacts sellers because sellers have this total misunderstanding that they think what they
4941.84s:  do is superior to buying. And it's not, it's not worse than buying. It's just different. It's just
4950.40s:  different than buying. That's the way to think about it. Lauren says that's why so many strategies
4955.44s:  include both. It's not, that's not the reason here. The reason why so many strategies include both
4962.56s:  is because for smaller accounts, you have to make a series of concessions that inherently suck.
4971.44s:  That's the reality of it. So for a small account, you are automatically going to be backed into
4978.24s:  having to make small adjustments and include elements of a trade because you can't afford to buy
4984.96s:  something outright or you can't afford to sell something outright. Now there are absolutely
4992.64s:  instances where it still makes sense to blend both of them together. And it's because each of them
4998.40s:  has different behavioral inputs in terms of how the trade will move. So it's less so that just because
5006.72s:  one is not better than the other, do them both and make it better. It's more because of those two
5011.12s:  reasons. Smaller accounts have to make concessions, trading things like verticals, horizontal spreads,
5016.16s:  stuff like that are cheaper and they're more accessible. The second thing is for more developed
5020.64s:  accounts, even though you're not necessarily worried about use of sizing and whatnot in terms
5026.00s:  of how much money. It's, it allows you to take advantage of the built-in components of buying versus
5033.60s:  selling and the benefits thereof, which is exactly what we're going to talk about when we get down
5040.00s:  here. Lawrence is hedging. Yeah, so you can buy or sell to hedge technically depending on how much
5046.40s:  you want to hedge, but that's another big reason why people will trade verticals is because it has a
5052.72s:  hedge baked in technically speaking. Cool. So let's take a look at the other, which is overweighting
5062.24s:  volatility. I say this because of tasty trade nation and you guys know I really like Tom
5070.24s:  Soznov. I love that dude. I have him on the podcast every couple months. I have a lot of respect for
5075.20s:  what he does. So this is in no way talking shit about him or what they do. But if you get into the
5082.48s:  habit of every single time bar none, you see volatility is high and you automatically default
5091.04s:  to selling just because volatility is high, you're making a mistake. You're making an objective mistake
5097.12s:  for a few reasons. One of them is depending on the ticker that you're trading, some of the most
5102.24s:  lucrative times to sell premium is when volatility is actually low. Weird, right? Probably haven't
5109.04s:  heard that. It's an absolute, absolute fact. The second thing is let's take a look at an example.
5116.24s:  Let me, I'm going to close this thing for now. And what's the vol in here? 79%.
5128.88s:  Implied volatility percentile 81%. I think most people would objectively say that's pretty high
5134.40s:  volatility, especially implied volatility percentile metric, correct? We would say that that's
5143.60s:  generally high-vol. So with generally high-vol, again, let's get back to basics. What does
5156.56s:  high-vol tell us? It tells us something very specific. What is it? What does high volatility tell us?
5166.64s:  Yes. Any guesses?
5179.04s:  And while you're thinking about that, Riz says expectations for future volatility good, so
5184.80s:  expand on that a little bit more. There you go. We'll stretch those right on target.
5190.56s:  But breaking the wall right on target. Good. Nathan Burke right on target. When we see volatility high,
5198.56s:  it means we expect larger movements. Okay. So then let's say let's go back here.
5211.04s:  Volatility was also high here in SoFi. Let's go back. I'm going to use on demand. We're going to go
5216.24s:  back in time and look at an example together. We're going to go back to 8 November. Let's do that.
5227.84s:  8 November.
5237.44s:  While this is loading, I want to talk about a couple other things. A lot of times there's a
5242.40s:  relationship between volatility and price movement, but it's not direct. What that means is a lot
5248.08s:  of times when you see a stock going up heavily, volatility will contract. And as the stock starts
5254.64s:  plummeting, volatility will expand massively. But it's not always. You can have things that are going
5260.72s:  up that are still highly volatile. So let's take a look at an example here. Let's pretend the
5268.32s:  date is not here because it's on demand. Let's pretend that the implied volatility percentile
5273.44s:  on the 8th of November right now is the same as what we just looked at. Right. So like 82%. Let's just
5281.68s:  pretend. Would that mean we would want to buy or sell if we were defaulting based off of the
5289.84s:  volatility level itself? And if we were making the mistake of overweighting the volatility input,
5305.84s:  we would be primed to sell. The taste is right on it. That's exactly correct. Again,
5312.24s:  we're generally taught if implied volatility percentile, if implied volatility rank,
5316.88s:  if implied volatility is high, we sell. One of the reason why we're primed to say that or we're
5324.64s:  primed to learn that is for this reason here. And again, this is probably easier to understand
5332.56s:  drawn out like this. So let's say you have an option. And let's say that this is the band.
5341.92s:  Let's say that this is 0% vol. This is 100% vol. And in this case, when I say 100%, I simply mean as high as
5355.44s:  it can go for the underlying, not actually 100%. So this, let me actually make this easier. So it's clear.
5362.40s:  So this will be the lowest. This will be the highest.
5371.76s:  So so far, just using today's metrics, I already forgot what they were, but I remember that it was at
5377.12s:  82% percentile. So 82% represents maybe about here. So there's still a little more room that it
5388.64s:  can go to the upside before it conceivably gets near wherever its highest point is. One important
5395.52s:  admin note is that there's not a cap. It can go. It can go as high as it wants, right? Volatility can
5402.08s:  be 1000. It can be 10. It can be one. It can be zero. Volatility can run all of this and it can
5408.80s:  be 15 hot, right? There's not a cap. There's not a natural ceiling to it. So what this is telling us,
5417.84s:  if you remember from the beginning, we spent a lot of time talking about one of the very important
5423.60s:  aspects of volatility from the beginning of this. Do you remember what it was? We talked about it
5430.16s:  for a hot minute, but there's a very specific element to this that you have to be aware of. And
5437.12s:  while you guys are telling me that, give me one second. I got to go check on the dog because my wife
5443.04s:  had a pop out. I will be or be give me one second. Put you guys over on this one.
5474.00s:  All right. Hi, A to sober. Nothing. Do you guys not remember the beginning of the the episode?
5493.44s:  There is a very specific thing we are talking about with respect to volatility. One of the most
5499.20s:  important traits of volatility and why we care about it so much. You guys have to know this.
5507.76s:  We compared VIX to SPX. And we talked about one of the key differences between VIX and SPX. We saw
5517.12s:  that SPX exhibited something called positive drift. We noticed that VIX, which is literally the
5524.08s:  volatility of SPX exhibited mean reversion. Lauren's on it. Mean reversion, also known as the snap.
5537.52s:  The reason why all this matters and the reason why you're taught to sell when IV is high is because
5543.68s:  the expectation is mean reversion. The expectation is that this vol will be more compelled to contract
5552.56s:  down to whatever the mean is. So this is why you are taught to sell volatility when volatility is high.
5565.76s:  There's a problem here. Big problem. The big, big problem here is this oversimplifies a really important
5576.64s:  function. What this does is it over emphasizes the impact of volatility as compared to the impact
5589.92s:  of delta. Take a pause there. I want to make sure that that point is clear.
5596.88s:  When we see this, it means we're prioritizing mentally, the movement of volatility. We are
5610.96s:  de-sensitizing the prioritization of delta. Unless you are truly isolating delta, it can overwhelm
5624.56s:  this volatility input. And I'll show you exactly what that looks like. I got to let floor.
5637.36s:  So we're being a straight diva. So let's take a look. We'll clear this off.
5644.48s:  Let's use this as an example. You are taught here to sell premium. The other thing that you're
5654.48s:  technically taught for a lot of people if you go with the Tasty Trade approach, which is to trade
5663.20s:  mean reversion and price extensions. So from a Tasty Trade perspective, we might look at something
5669.92s:  like this and say, well, this is like really overextended to the upside. Valtility is super high.
5674.96s:  Let me come in and sell a call, something like this. And somebody else might say, well, I'm actually
5681.84s:  expecting this to continue in this direction. I think it looks really good here. I'm going to trade
5688.80s:  at bullish and I'm going to sell a put. Let me see if I can enter these as single trades. The
5694.80s:  reason why I want to do this is so that you can see how each one of these will behave. Yeah,
5698.72s:  let me clear all this nonsense out. Perfect. We have this one. We have the person that sold a put.
5711.68s:  I'm giving you three scenarios. And then we have somebody else, the enterprising trader,
5717.44s:  who is more interested in isolating profit mechanisms that instead says, you know what,
5722.08s:  I'm actually going to buy a call instead of these other ones. And now this, I, one of these I have
5728.56s:  to move us back in time. I think maybe this one, which is November 8th. So you guys can see what
5742.64s:  this there goes. So first person says, price is extended to the upside. I favor it to the
5752.00s:  downside. Volatility is high. I'm going to sell a call. Second person says, I like it to the upside.
5757.76s:  I don't want to trade against the trend, but I'm going to sell premium because volatility is high.
5763.84s:  Third person says, I think it's going to go up more. And I don't care that volatility is high.
5770.32s:  I think the price movement is going to be bigger than any change in volatility. The price movement
5776.96s:  is represented by delta. So if we take a look at the options chain quickly, you can see that Vega
5783.92s:  here, which we know Vega is the rate of change premium relative to changes in implied volatility.
5792.56s:  Vega is 0.02. So every one point move involved will change this by 0.02. Whereas delta for every
5802.32s:  one point move in the underlying is going to change it by 64 cents. So what that tells us in order
5809.92s:  for this move to overwhelm the delta component of this trade, you literally can do the math.
5818.00s:  You need this essentially, you need volatile change by 32%. In order for that volatility to overwhelm
5826.48s:  a one point move in the underlying. So somebody knows that and they're playing the directional move
5834.64s:  instead. Okay, so let's just fast forward this quickly and we'll go straight to expiration,
5840.08s:  which is in this example 20 days. We'll go here.
5845.20s:  And let's see how this does.
5851.44s:  Thorne.
5854.08s:  Like digging through his bed. He is on a whole crackhead vibe right now.
5860.32s:  Okay, let's see what this gives us.
5865.28s:  Sick. So let's start with the short call. The short call got ran over. The short call stepped
5872.72s:  in front of something they thought that they knew better than what market price was.
5876.96s:  Something was overextended and they just decided to step in front of the trend and they got
5881.44s:  ran over to the upside. Fun fact, this is what happens in the majority of those instances.
5887.12s:  Just keeping it a buck. You can be a good price mean reversion trader. It is a thing,
5892.24s:  but it is so much more complex than simply saying this thing's gone up a lot. I think it should
5898.32s:  go down now. That ain't it. If that's the thesis, that's not a good thesis. Okay, so the short call
5906.96s:  ran over crushed. Second one, we have the short put. The short put we originally sold it for 56 cents
5916.08s:  and as of today in here, it should be what put did we have? The 12 put.
5925.84s:  The 12 put is, I mean, technically trading a liquid. Let's just say that it's trading at zero.
5933.84s:  It should be about zero, meaning this would be a full profit. This short put would be a full
5940.96s:  profit of 56 cents or 56 dollars. Let's take a look at the long call. The long call as of today
5949.12s:  is up $223. What does all of this tell you? This tells you that if you're making the trade decision
5961.76s:  based solely on volatility, you make two wrong decisions, possibly. The first decision is if you're
5971.52s:  a contrarian trader trying to trade a downside move and you default to that, you just stepped in
5976.00s:  in front of a moving trade and just lost in terms of direction. The volatility did not help you.
5980.56s:  Your Vega, the volatility contracting as this thing made its up move did not help you. You were
5985.52s:  overrun by Delta. It ran you over. This one, best case scenario, you made Max profit. That's awesome.
5994.96s:  But you traded something that was defined profit potential on something that maybe you thought it
6002.96s:  was going to move a lot. If you think something's going to move a lot, why would we define our profit?
6011.44s:  That doesn't make a lot of sense. Then there's the third scenario, the long call, the call that you bought,
6019.68s:  even though volatility was high and you're told if volatility was high, you're supposed to default to
6025.12s:  sell. Even though you did not do that, you made more money than both of these other scenarios.
6033.68s:  This is precisely why we do not overweight volatility and we don't just automatically default to
6042.80s:  one or the other. So now let's talk about when to buy when to sell.
6051.12s:  The first factor in deciding when we want to buy an option is what fits the portfolio.
6059.28s:  That's the first thing. The reason why portfolio fit matters is because that ultimately is the
6067.44s:  governing decision of what needs to go on. So you all know in terms of my approach to trading
6073.60s:  and portfolio management, it always starts at the portfolio. So what I mean by this is if I have a
6079.36s:  portfolio that's full of short premium strategies, meaning defined profit undefined risk.
6087.92s:  I might start trying to look for some long premium strategies to try to offset some of that
6095.76s:  convexity that is against me in that scenario as compared to being in my favor.
6102.64s:  That's why we started the portfolio. That's the first factor. The second is your risk
6109.36s:  preference, meaning the downside risk, meaning downside the loss risk, I should say. It's not
6116.48s:  relegated to stock going down. This risk preference is your loss management preference.
6125.20s:  It's what are we comfortable with taking in terms of risk in the trade. So what that means going
6132.72s:  back to this example. The difference, let's just get rid of the short call because it's a completely
6139.60s:  different thesis. If I'm comparing this short put against the long call, the difference is on the
6146.96s:  short put, I have undefined risk and defined profit. If I'm uncomfortable with this undefined risk,
6154.24s:  because maybe as I'm looking at so far, I think maybe it can go up a lot or down a lot. And I'm
6160.08s:  just not sure which one I have a slight favor to the upside, but it's not it's slight. It's not a
6166.40s:  ton. So I don't want to step in front of this to the downside in case I'm wrong, because then I
6172.16s:  can have something where I stand to make $56, but let's say it drops to nine and I lose $282.
6179.68s:  That's not a great risk reward profile. That's the risk preference. So then there's this risk
6188.16s:  preference where we can say, okay, my max risk at the time of entering this trade is 117.
6194.80s:  I'm okay with that because that means if it moves a lot of my favor, I make more than the other
6199.20s:  scenario. And if it moves a lot against me, I make a lot in this scenario. I lose less in this
6206.24s:  scenario, slightly more optimal. Joseph's straddle or strangle, that's if you don't have a directional
6214.16s:  preference. And the straddle or strangle won't make as much money if it does, in fact, move in the
6221.12s:  direction that you might think it does. So the way to think about using a long straddle or strangle
6227.36s:  is if you just expect movement, but you really don't have a sense of which way it's going to go.
6231.84s:  In this case, we were talking about trading a breakout strategy, trading breaks break out to the
6236.16s:  upside means we have a directional preference, but we just don't want to get ran over if it goes
6240.64s:  against us. So that's the risk preference. The third profit mechanism. This goes back to the
6249.12s:  prior example that I just gave you. If we have something, we got in here on this day.
6264.96s:  We got in here. Here, I think I was here. We got in here. We're here, whatever, one of these do.
6276.56s:  While it's doing this, if my profit mechanism
6288.16s:  is a bullish price movement,
6292.00s:  break out, which is the subtype, I know based on my trading approach, break out's
6314.64s:  carry more severity, which means bigger moves, higher severity.
6325.60s:  So if I'm trading this profit mechanism, if I come across so far, I think it's about to
6332.80s:  break out for whatever reason based on my analysis, based on my approach, and it looks like it'll
6337.92s:  have a breakout, which again, typically means it has bigger moves. Do I want to sell a put
6346.32s:  or do I want to buy a call? Which fits this better? Selling a put or buying a call,
6357.52s:  based on the scenario that I just laid out for you, what takes best advantage of this profit
6365.20s:  mechanism? It's very clearly one of these. This is a primary differentiator between the way that I
6375.60s:  think about markets compared to what I see a lot of other people think about markets. And I don't
6380.08s:  actually know why. I think it's because of trying to oversimplify things a little bit. The problem
6385.36s:  is if you oversimplify things too much, it kind of sucks. And it kind of sucks because it sabotages
6392.80s:  the nuance, which is where a lot of the potential is. Because in this scenario, both of these would
6399.36s:  have won. Both of these made money. But the difference is this made way more money four times
6408.56s:  the amount of money than this one did. So what ends up happening is you have people that defaults
6415.52s:  to selling options because it's a higher probability trade. They like the idea of winning frequently.
6422.00s:  But then this might not make any sense based on the profit mechanism. So that goes back to this point.
6436.64s:  When we're making the decision on buying versus selling, one of the factors portfolio fit. Second
6445.52s:  factor risk preference of the difference between buying and selling premium, which you're aware of now.
6451.20s:  The third factor is what is the profit mechanism and what makes more sense for that profit mechanism.
6461.52s:  The fourth factor is now and salary overlays as I refer to it as this is where we get into the fine
6470.32s:  tuning details of things like do I have an opinion on being short theta long gamma do I have an
6478.72s:  opinion on that for this specific trade if nothing here stacked up in my favor. Or if nothing here
6486.24s:  naturally diverted me into buying versus selling. Ancillary overlays is if I get through all of this
6492.96s:  agnostic to buying or selling risk preference don't care buying or selling profit mechanism is
6498.32s:  price direction up. But it's not really I'm not expecting a whole lot of movement although it
6504.64s:  so we're still at the point where buying or selling can make sense. Now.
6511.44s:  Now it might make sense to say what's implied volatility percent highlight.
6516.72s:  Does that make sense for this position.
6522.32s:  Matea says I prefer sold the put and Joe says I prefer selling puts as well and that's okay.
6527.84s:  People will have preferences. The problem with preferences like that is they're objectively
6532.56s:  suboptimal. So you have to accept that. But that's okay. You can trade suboptimally. You don't
6541.52s:  have to overfit and have things as optimized as possible. What I can tell you is it's better
6548.64s:  to have things as optimized as possible. It's how I've been trading like I said I just wrapped up my
6553.76s:  18th year of trading. It's how I've been doing this for so long. So there's nothing wrong.
6559.68s:  If you choose and you're like, I'd rather just sell the put versus buying the call. I prefer it
6564.96s:  for these X, Y and Z reasons. The problem is is that we have an arbitrary preference based on
6572.48s:  not logic at that point. It's based on an underlying assumption. Matea says you don't know if the
6579.52s:  call is going to have profits. You don't know if the put is either. If you're that that tells me
6584.40s:  that there's a breakdown in the strategy that's not the problem with buying versus selling.
6589.04s:  If you buy a call or sell a put, you don't know if that put's going to have profit either. It can
6592.32s:  go against you. You can be directionally wrong. The point is if you buy a call and you're
6596.88s:  directionally correct in this scenario, you simply make more money. It's based on your strategy.
6600.88s:  That's not a fault with buying versus selling. And this goes back to the broader point. Because
6607.12s:  in this case for the people that say, well, I prefer to sell the put again, that's cool.
6611.60s:  But the reality is if you sold a put in that scenario, you made 56 bucks. The person that bought the
6616.40s:  call in that scenario made literally four times the money. So what that leads to long-term
6622.80s:  is significant outperformance. This is why people who like getting into selling and start defaulting
6629.20s:  to selling, which is way, way more common than people defaulting into buying beyond just being
6635.28s:  more comfortable with the concept of buying. But sellers are notorious for that. It's because it
6640.24s:  becomes a comfort zone. It becomes comfortable because it's a higher probability trade. And it's
6644.88s:  okay, you can be comfortable. But there's a cost for comfort. You're not going to make as much
6649.84s:  money. That's just how it's going to go. And that's okay. For some people that might be slightly
6658.00s:  more preferential. And that's totally cool. It really is totally cool. It's up to the individual
6663.36s:  trader to figure it out. But as I always try to remind traders, what's most important in my opinion
6670.00s:  is going into things. Eyes wide open. Objectively saying, I prefer selling puts, I know it's suboptimal.
6679.12s:  It's suboptimal for this reason, this reason, this reason, these reasons. But I still prefer it for
6684.48s:  these reasons. And I'm okay with that trade off. That's cool. That is completely cool. But what a
6690.16s:  lot of people do is they shy away from that because they get uncomfortable. And they don't want to
6695.04s:  look at the suboptimal components of what they're doing because then we're acknowledging that what
6699.68s:  we're doing like truly isn't fully logical. And that can be difficult for people to swallow.
6706.56s:  But yeah, I have absolutely no issue with people that have a general preference one way or the
6713.68s:  other. The again, the downside to it is you're going to see it in your performance. And you could
6718.16s:  be okay with that. But for somebody like me, it's not okay. My job is to trade as effectively as I
6726.96s:  can given my sets of parameters to make as much money as I possibly can. And it's how I made so much
6733.44s:  money through trading before I was 30 is by optimizing in this way. So just food for thought.
6740.96s:  Okay. So that wraps us up for the session today. Now I have some homework for you guys.
6750.08s:  One of the things I'm going to give you and then we'll get into Open Q&A. I'm not done yet.
6754.72s:  But I just want to give you your homework in case you do have to bounce because I know we've
6758.80s:  been on for a little while. Which is here. Let me find it.
6770.24s:  Here.
6782.24s:  So this is your homework. The takeaway for today is to go and select
6792.72s:  four stocks. Actually, you could do two stocks. You don't even need four. Select two stocks.
6799.68s:  And you want one that you're bullish in and you want one that you're bearish in.
6806.08s:  Then in both of those stocks based on aligning with your disposition,
6814.88s:  create a long premium strategy and a short premium strategy and just compare. See how they go.
6822.08s:  So the way that this would work just to summarize actually, I realize I need to add the time stamp
6828.32s:  here for homework. 53. Just call it one for the three. This will be episode two homework.
6836.64s:  So what you'll do is you'll say stock XYZ. I'm bullish.
6843.60s:  The profit mechanism, if you're following the outlier strategy process, we codify
6848.88s:  what the profit mechanism is. If you're unfamiliar with what the outlier strategy or outlier trade
6853.60s:  processes, I have two videos. It's completely free. There's nothing attached to it. It's just to
6858.32s:  give you a framework on how to think about these things a little more effectively.
6864.00s:  Because they're frameworks that I built for myself for that exact reason. So those are the two.
6870.64s:  So I threw them in the chat there and then I'll also throw it in the video notes so that you have that.
6879.76s:  Let me grab this one really quick.
6885.84s:  Okay. So profit mechanism here is going to be price direction up.
6890.88s:  The subtype is whatever the subtype is. It can be drifted and be breakout.
6900.96s:  It can be catalyst. Whatever it is. And then based on that, I'm going to structure
6909.84s:  two different trades in the same underline. So I know I'm going to trade two. I'm going to put
6916.64s:  on two bullish trades in here. So this one I might sell a put and this one I might buy a call.
6924.32s:  So this is the first one. Then you do it for another stock that you're bearish in. So stock
6934.80s:  ABC, we're bearish. You go through the same process and then here, maybe we sell a call and then
6944.80s:  buy a put like that. So that's the homework. And for those that are in the discord, which again,
6955.52s:  it's completely free to join, you can throw it in the channel. I've built a thread for the learning
6963.76s:  lab. I'll share a link here, which is a thread for essentially collating stuff around this.
6982.40s:  Okay.
6994.48s:  So the link to that is here. I thought it was here. How do I share this link?
7003.28s:  Copy link. Here you go. It's here. And then for those that are not in there and you don't want to
7011.68s:  join total equal, you can throw it as comments to the video. One of the things, the reason I'm asking
7017.60s:  you to do this is because the process of seeing what other people do will help you generate some
7022.88s:  ideas. And that, I think, is worth your time. So that's why that is your homework. Okay. So now is
7032.64s:  literally the perfect time. If you have ancillary questions, things that we didn't hit throughout the
7038.40s:  episode, now is the perfect time. And it doesn't have to be specific to the episode. If there's just
7043.36s:  random stuff you saw this week in the options markets that you're curious about. If there's a
7047.76s:  burning options question that you've had for some time. If there's a concept you're unclear on,
7052.64s:  if there's a step in your process and you're like, I don't know where to go now. This is the
7057.92s:  perfect time for all that stuff. And while you guys are doing that, I'm going to start going through
7062.48s:  and figure out what the dinner plan is going to be because I don't really know this will work.
7074.72s:  That was actually easier than I thought. And then I'll pop up and see what you guys are thinking.
7083.28s:  Good, good, good. That's all good.
7093.36s:  And that's good. Cool. All right. What questions you guys have?
7099.68s:  Anything from here sticking out. And then in the meantime, a quick preview of the next one
7107.36s:  is going to be looking at option pricing. So we want to get more close to things like early assignment.
7117.68s:  Thinking through when we might choose to close trades. That kind of stuff. Let's talk about early.
7125.92s:  Well, let's do exercise.
7130.48s:  Assignment.
7133.44s:  Process and risks.
7136.80s:  And then the other note is if there are specific options trading topics that we want to hit,
7146.16s:  we still have a handful of flex sessions that we can build out. So just keep that in mind.
7152.32s:  All right. Let's get into some Q and A and see where we at. I will probably keep this up because
7159.68s:  there's a good chance I'm a draw. I bet.
7167.52s:  And Reese says toss head and video IV R at zero, which may be tempted to buy options.
7175.28s:  Is that miss miss guided all selling premium because IV? Yep, that's correct. That's miss guided.
7184.32s:  The reason why it's miss guided is based on that alone, there are two things to keep in mind.
7191.92s:  And let's again, let's take it back to basics.
7199.60s:  There all this up. If I buy to open, we know I need movement.
7208.00s:  If ball. Well, in this case, IV R equals zero, that equals very low ball, which equals very low
7230.88s:  movement. Very low movement does not equal need movement.
7247.44s:  So while you might say I'm going to buy to open a straddle, because I think
7265.36s:  VAL will go up. This is still a secondary profit mechanism.
7281.92s:  Primary is still Delta. So the way that I would look at that specific trade
7291.20s:  race is let's say that I was bullish in Nvidia or bearish whichever. I have a directional preference
7299.52s:  in Nvidia. And then let's say I look at the portfolio. Portfolio doesn't need anything specific,
7304.40s:  doesn't matter. I look at the different risk profile between those. I'm indifferent. It doesn't
7308.72s:  matter. So now I'm at the point of structuring the trade. Then I might say, okay, I'm slightly
7314.88s:  bullish in this idea. And I don't really know how much it's going to move. I don't necessarily
7320.72s:  think this is going to be a moonshot. So then what I do is super, super simple.
7328.40s:  We come out of on demand. We go into Nvidia. And then we say, let me just clear this out.
7337.84s:  We can close one of these programs down. And then I say, where do I think it's going to go?
7347.28s:  I think it's going to go up. I think it's going to go up by how much. So let's say my profit
7352.24s:  target is going to be 150 in the next couple of weeks. So then I say, how do I compare these?
7359.04s:  I say, well, I have a bullish tilt IV super low. Let me take a look at selling this put.
7368.40s:  Let me compare that selling that put against to buying this call. Maybe we go further out on the call.
7378.16s:  Something like this. And my preference, my price target here is going to be a dollar 50. I'm
7385.36s:  sorry, 150. That's the initial price target, 150. So all I do is I say, what do I make at 150 here?
7391.60s:  I make $102 on this one. What do I make here? A thousand sixteen. So let me say, well,
7397.12s:  you're going to put up more money on this one because you have to buy 1485, 1485 bucks.
7403.28s:  So what's the margin requirement for this one? 13,000. It's already the same, right? Because this
7408.80s:  is a pass through IRA account. So it's requiring it to be cash secured on a regulation T margin
7414.40s:  account. You might be able to get two or three. I have portfolio margin. So I'm actually not sure
7418.48s:  what the margin requirement would be and how many you could put on. But let's just say you could put
7422.80s:  on a multiple of whatever it is. So let's say you put on five. Well, if I put on five and I get
7429.20s:  that move to 150, I make five 14. If I buy this one and I get that move to 150, I make 1016.
7439.44s:  Right. So you see what I'm you see what I'm highlighting is that the profit mechanism here is
7444.88s:  still direction. Now, if I look at these and the difference is negligible based on my price target,
7451.52s:  let's say I don't think it's going to go up that high. Let's say looking at this price and
7456.32s:  all this stuff, I think it might go to 141 and we analyze the difference instead at 141, it will be
7462.96s:  much tighter. So 141, we make 405 here, 141 on the put why is that showing it losing money?
7482.48s:  I'm confused. Oh, is that because it's lower than I know? It's not.
7494.96s:  For the dates messed up. There it is. The thing down here was using old dates. That's why I was so confused.
7506.48s:  So if I sold five of these and it goes to 141, I make 415. If I buy one of these, I make 195.
7517.44s:  So now it's actually stacking in favor of selling. And then I also have the secondary benefit
7523.76s:  of expecting maybe some sort of expansion involved, but I don't care. Like the selling perspective
7531.36s:  still makes more money here. So the dominant feature is still direction. That's the takeaway there.
7541.52s:  Cool. Let me know if that makes sense for you. Next is from Peter, when you sell a put versus buying
7550.96s:  a call for a bullish thesis, doesn't selling the put have a higher probability of making money
7556.00s:  depending on the delta you choose? Yep. It does. And you can calculate all of that stuff
7562.16s:  depending on how you intend to manage it. That's an important element because let's use the same
7568.08s:  example that we're looking at now. And I'm just going to reduce it to, we'll keep it out of five
7572.48s:  lot. And let's say that I'm going to manage this trade, meaning if it goes to different prices,
7583.04s:  I'm going to exit. So let's say that I'm going to exit. If it goes below this handle, the 128,
7592.48s:  let's say it goes to 128. And that's where I would exit. Well, if I go in here and I take a look at
7598.72s:  128, let's say that I'm going to have this trade on for two weeks. And I take a look at the
7604.96s:  probability of touching 128. The probability of touching 128 is 30% chance. So what I'm showing
7613.04s:  you is that that higher probability will help you. But if you're going to manage it based on different
7620.00s:  touches like this in terms of a directional trading approach, that that benefit actually decreases
7626.72s:  a little bit, not a ton, but it decreases a little bit. So what that ends up meaning for you is
7632.56s:  then we can analyze at the 128 loss handle, which one of these looks better based on how much you
7640.24s:  can make. And then you can literally conduct it. You can literally conduct an expected return
7645.92s:  calculation. So if we take a look at the 128, let's say that we think it's going to go between 141
7653.76s:  and 128. Those are our two targets. And let's go into the scratch here so that is there not
7660.64s:  an expected return in here that's annoying? Give me one sec. I'm just going to drop an expected
7666.72s:  return calculation in here. And then I'll get rid of whatever all this nonsense is.
7677.76s:  And let's do this one.
7696.96s:  Now, we'll take a peek.
7712.48s:  Our target is going to be the 142 for the profit. Our loss is going to be 128. This will be
7721.44s:  for the long call. This will be for the short puts. So we already know, we already did some of the
7730.56s:  math here. And we already know that the probability of hitting the 128 was what, like 30% or 28%
7740.48s:  I already forgot because you know, the memory of a goldfish, 28.5%.
7758.16s:  And then the probability of us hitting 142 in that same time frame.
7761.44s:  64.4%. This is based on our managed targets, 64.4. Meaning once it hits these levels, we would do
7775.60s:  something. And depending on what it is that we would do. So now, let's take a look at the PNL
7784.40s:  levels. So the long call at 142 and 128. Let me wish this down so that we can look at this stuff
7795.76s:  at the same time.
7808.08s:  And then we'll go to the risk profile. So now, all we do,
7812.32s:  we're on the short puts. So we'll start with that at 142. We make 555 up to 1650.
7825.92s:  So we'll put 555 to start. And then we have to add another column specifically
7832.88s:  for the short puts because it's going to change the time frame.
7836.40s:  So this will be short puts managed and then there will be short puts,
7841.84s:  X-Berry. And then at X-Berry, that would be 1650.
7847.20s:  Now, we need to also do the loss side at expiration, which would be for those short puts 21FAB.
7871.04s:  So we'll use that here. The reason why it's important to do that is because you'll see that it
7875.20s:  actually opens up the expected moves quite a lot. So then there will be two series of
7882.40s:  probabilities that we're going to be talking about. There will be at expiration and then prior to
7887.60s:  expiration. And we'll do this for both. So this will be probability at a management point.
7894.96s:  And then this will be probability at expiration. This will be at a management point.
7904.96s:  And then this will be the long call, same thing. And this is literally something you all can do
7911.92s:  for yourselves to understand how this stuff works and to get more comfortable with the behavior of
7917.92s:  these. So right now, we're starting with the management point. Let's just finish the management
7926.00s:  point through for all of them. And the management point, I'm using a perspective two week time frame
7931.12s:  for something like that. So then the 128s or at 128, this would make lose 2064. 2064.
7948.48s:  And now let's take a look at the long calls quickly.
7960.40s:  At the profit target of 142,
7965.84s:  our long call itself would make 195.
7971.04s:  And then at 128, it loses 530. So these are, it's not a totally fair comparison because you could tell
7982.64s:  by these numbers, we're using a different overall size and scope, right? Because I didn't actually do
7987.60s:  the math to see for regulation T how many calls I could put on, but it doesn't matter.
7993.60s:  You'll still see the the important output here. So now let's take a look,
7998.80s:  update the probabilities based on at expiration. So the probability
8008.56s:  of hitting 142 and being there at expiration, we have to update this.
8016.72s:  So expiration for the short, let's just 21 Feb here. And the probability of 142
8029.60s:  is 37. Realistically, the top side doesn't matter that much actually is we're looking at this.
8036.24s:  For the short put, what matters is our strike, which is the 131. So what's the probability 21 Feb
8043.04s:  of being above 131? 66.6. 66.6% chance. And then the probability
8059.28s:  of being below that less the credit, which is 131 minus 3. So let's just call it 127.5.
8070.80s:  Damn expiration.
8077.52s:  127.5 below that 25% chance.
8088.64s:  And then our risk at that level at expiration would be 2064. So I have to move this number over.
8100.56s:  And then at 128 before that would be 1840.
8111.12s:  And then I'll summarize all this for you so that you kind of know what the fuck is going on.
8119.44s:  So then the short puts at 142 before
8124.48s:  will be 583. That's good. Okay. So now let's take a look at the long calls really quick.
8132.40s:  Long call at 142 will be like 527.
8140.32s:  And then at 128, I'm an idiot at 142.
8151.04s:  So it will be 266. And then 128 would be 522.
8167.12s:  Negative. And then this is negative.
8172.00s:  And then this is negative.
8185.76s:  Now what I've just made is an entire matrix that we can objectively analyze this.
8194.16s:  Now one thing to keep in mind is you don't have to do after each trade that you do or you'll
8199.60s:  get a sense of what these numbers are going to be. So that's the benefit. You'll develop a little
8204.24s:  bit of intuition here. But what we can do is we can figure out the expected return for both of
8209.44s:  these scenarios. So we can do expected return for a managed position and we can do expected return
8216.56s:  at X-PRI. And then we can compare these.
8220.56s:  Expected return. We'll just do it actually down here.
8231.92s:  So this will equal this.
8252.00s:  Well, hold on, you guys know how to do this.
8258.96s:  What? Yeah, I just realized I'm about to start building this whole thing out for you.
8262.48s:  But you guys know how to do this, right?
8265.60s:  So if we take a look and compare the two different strategies, we would have an expected return
8271.52s:  for the long call. And we would have an expected return.
8276.64s:  So this should be expected return for managed. This will be expected return for managed.
8285.28s:  And there will be two different expected returns. There will be one for the long call.
8290.88s:  And then there will be one for the short puts. And then you literally make the decision based
8296.24s:  on this. So then there will be an expected return at expiration for the long call and expected
8302.56s:  return at expiration for the short puts. And then you compare these.
8309.84s:  And now you can make an actual decision. And I think you guys already know how to do this.
8316.40s:  I'll show you just hold on.
8324.72s:  I think you guys, well, let's just do the first one. And then I'll have you guys do the other
8329.84s:  ones. So let's do the expected return for the long call. The expected return for the long call
8334.08s:  is the wind probability or the wind size times the wind probability. And in this case,
8339.76s:  we have to do plus because this is negative number plus the loss times the loss probability.
8348.08s:  And then for the short put, the wind size times the wind probability plus the loss times the loss
8363.52s:  probability. And you can see from this perspective, which one looks good out of the gate. And then you
8373.04s:  could do the same thing. This is looking at a managed position. This is looking at expiration.
8403.52s:  And then you can literally make the comparison, which one of these fits better.
8407.84s:  So you guys can fill out this other side because you guys can obviously follow along with what I
8412.80s:  did. And when you have the answer to this side, again, either throw it as a comment, throw it in
8416.96s:  the chat or throw it in the discord. And let me get through the rest of these. And then your boy
8423.60s:  is going to wrap up. Um, Alberto said, okay, so you guys already answered that.
8433.20s:  M 54 says how often do options traders exercise their contracts or is it mostly trading the contract?
8438.24s:  The overwhelming majority has traded. It's like over 70%. Exercise is a subset of that. I want to say
8444.72s:  it's like 15 or 18% or maybe the low 20s, but it's a minority of interest.
8451.84s:  The TAS says, what would be a good strategy for you that combines both selling and buying?
8457.52s:  Um, for me, it would be ratio diagonals. That is a way that I combine both buying and selling.
8467.68s:  But the reason why I combine both buying and selling in that context is to take advantage of
8474.80s:  the risk profile of buying and selling specifically, which is a little bit different than the
8484.72s:  sake of like buying and selling again, just for like the sake of reducing risk or something like that.
8491.52s:  For me, when I'm including both buying and selling components of a trade, it's for a very,
8496.40s:  very specific risk profile. It's not because I'm trying to like reduce risk. The thing is,
8502.00s:  is traders get obsessed with reducing risk with their positions and thus in doing so, you
8508.16s:  inherently reduce your profitability. And becoming too risk adverse literally becomes a disease.
8515.60s:  It becomes a really, really big thing that we like the feeling of it. It's less scary. But if you
8522.72s:  condition yourself to trade, for example, like naked premium strategies and you just size appropriately,
8528.00s:  you realize that's actually not that scary. And the risk is completely capable of being controlled
8534.16s:  effectively. So yeah, that's the main time that I would be mixing buying and selling or doing
8540.96s:  buying and selling at the same time would be via ratio call diagonal. The other example could be
8546.96s:  something like the coverage strangle that I run, which is what I consider to be a superior alternative
8553.76s:  to the wheel. But that's buying equity and then selling options. So a little bit different.
8559.44s:  Capital Apes is do you recommend selling premium on leveraged ETFs? If you want, I have a
8566.24s:  coverage strangle on right now and you prone T triple cues. So it can be fine, but you just have to
8571.52s:  understand the ticker like the product in that case that you're trading and be comfortable with it.
8577.68s:  But yeah, I mean, it can work. Okay, you just have to have a solid management plan in place for
8584.96s:  it because it can also be really, really destructive at the same time if you don't.
8592.56s:  Lauren says this is the part that stresses me out not because I'm lazy and don't want to do it
8596.56s:  because I don't know how. And that's why we're doing this exact thing together here is to show you how.
8603.12s:  And this is a really easy way to think about managing risk. And I have a video that talks about this
8611.60s:  exact process of how to do this kind of thing. And the main goal here is to quantify different levels
8625.04s:  so that we can make an objective decision of a virtual numbers.
8630.96s:  Mark says for long calls, are we better off targeting strikes in the money or out of the money?
8635.28s:  And how far in and out is there a method to madness and picking the strikes? They're absolutely
8638.88s:  as there's an entire science box. And you guessed it, I have a video that walks through literally
8647.60s:  that entire process in detail on. Let me see.
8659.12s:  Where is it? Here you go.
8673.68s:  This one. So, Mark, this video will walk you through that in its entirety. There's a lot to it.
8680.56s:  That's why it's not a it's not a small question. I literally think that video I just dropped in.
8684.48s:  There was like 20 minutes long. And it's because it goes through the striking a balance between
8689.28s:  the various deltas and stuff. The Cliff Notes version is you have to think through what
8694.64s:  expiration makes sense. Then within that expiration, the strike selection really is not about the strikes
8701.36s:  at all. It's all about delta gamma and theta. Those are the main inputs in deciding what you want to
8707.68s:  buy. So the way I look at it is I don't even care what the strike price is. It literally is
8712.48s:  meaningless to me. What matters are the Greeks that I'm trying to pick up for the trade idea.
8718.88s:  And that will depend on how much you're expecting the thing to move. If you expect something to move
8724.24s:  a lot, then you can make way more money by building what we call units, which is using further out
8729.92s:  of the money options that have high gamma. So they're not super far out in time. So that they'll
8734.32s:  compound a lot. If you're expecting a medium amount of movement, then that's typically how I structure
8741.92s:  them. I'll use options that are at least 60 days. Texturation preferably 90 as at a minimum
8748.80s:  for the long option component. That's because it decreases the overall theta decay per day.
8754.24s:  Even though you're paying more money outright, I'm not taking it into expiration. Then I use a higher
8759.76s:  delta to start one because it also decreases theta decay, but you will also get a better dollar for
8764.88s:  dollar move with the underlying. So if I have a delta that's 80 or 70 or even 60 as the underlying
8770.80s:  goes up one dollar, that is going to move by 60 cents. So the underlying gives you a dollar move
8777.28s:  that gives you 60 cents. You're collecting a good bit of that. If you have a really low delta option
8782.32s:  of 10 delta, if the underlying moves a dollar, you get fucked and just have $10 to show for it,
8788.08s:  meaning a 10 cent move. So the only time that the out of the money start to make a lot more sense is
8793.84s:  if you're expecting a really, really big movement, which for me, a lot of times I will add them to
8800.16s:  something like a ratio called diagonal, I call them kicker options. They add like a little bit of
8805.28s:  a kicker to the trade if it goes in your favor. But then you still have the primary base of the
8810.00s:  trade, which is the in the money options, lower theta decay, but they move better for dollar with
8816.48s:  the underlying itself. So that's the high level overview of that 20 minute video.
8823.36s:  All right.
8828.24s:  Wheat. All right, guys, I am tired. I really enjoy doing these. I try to make sure I'm doing a good
8835.20s:  job for you guys. I want to give you really, really good information as best as I possibly can.
8840.08s:  The only thing I ask from you all is if you can, please share what we're doing with other people.
8847.60s:  The reason why I care about that so much is you can tell there's not even ads that run during
8852.00s:  the livestream or anything like I literally make nothing from doing this. But this is like,
8858.16s:  this is the pay it forward part of what that mentor did for me. And do you be clear? He never did
8865.36s:  anything like this for me. He doesn't even know how to trade. That's funny. But he's the one that
8869.76s:  introduced me to investing. And I feel so indebted because of where and how it's changed the
8878.96s:  trajectory of my life. And I know how important this stuff can be for people. So that's the
8886.72s:  main thing that you guys can do to help me with this is literally just to share it with other
8892.72s:  people that are trying to figure out how to trade options because there's so much information out
8898.80s:  there that's a lot of it is meant in good faith. But it's just not great information, unfortunately.
8906.40s:  So my goal is to try and connect people with better information and not all of it's going to be
8912.16s:  mine. Like one of the biggest books I recommend is Options as a strategic investment, stuff like that.
8917.60s:  So yeah, hope the session was useful. Absolutely enjoy talking about this stuff. We have a big one
8925.92s:  set up for next week. Lauren, the homey just hooked people up, five people without
8932.64s:  liar trading memberships. Really it's just a way to support the channel. So super, super
8935.92s:  thankful for doing that and hooking some people up. And yeah, if you guys need anything, you guys
8940.88s:  can hit me up in the discord in the comments. Whatever. Happy to help as best I can be an outlier.
8945.92s:  I'll see you guys later. Enjoy the weekend.
