720.00s: you
722.00s: we're looking at. We have this band and then we have this band.
734.40s: If I were to take this band and I were to stretch it and you can see that I actually
739.36s: lined it up pretty well with these the grid lines here. And let's say that I take this band
744.96s: and I stretch it up to this point here. And let's say I do the same thing here. So what is
751.84s: that one, two, three, four? So we go from here, one, two, three, four. Unfortunately,
756.88s: it's really close to this. What's the difference between these bands? Let's say that there's tension
765.12s: as you can see on the first band. And then what I was trying to make clear on the second band is
768.48s: that there's some slack. So as I expand, as I pull these bands up, what's the difference between
775.36s: these two bands? If I were maybe to just let go of the band, what do you what do you think would happen?
781.44s: If we were to run a little little trading experiment together and we have these two bands,
786.72s: top band, bottom band, I expand them both the same distance through the same length, pretend
792.08s: they're the same length. They're not really this one should be over here. There you go.
798.88s: Lauren is on it. This top band would have probably much greater downward force as soon as I let go
807.84s: the one with slack can kind of take up some space. So maybe the band with looks like this once we
816.16s: stretch it out, right? The point that I'm trying to make here is the concept of actual mean reversion.
823.84s: Mean reversion is this function, whereas something gets too extended one way or the other. So in this
832.16s: case, if we extend it this way or this way, these bands, this band wants to come back here.
840.40s: Wants to be about this range here. This band doesn't really care as much. This band will say,
848.88s: okay, we'll use you stretch me to this point up here. And once the slack is out, I'm already at
855.04s: this point. So then if you let go of me from here, I'm just going to cover this distance. I don't
859.20s: really care that much. This is the difference of a mean reverting asset compared to a standard
866.32s: growth asset of some sort. So to bring all of this back to the current chart that we're looking at,
873.68s: I want you to take a look at every single time. Well, that's a terrible line. Every single time
881.28s: price moves away from this midline. It pops up and then it goes back down. It pops up a whole
888.88s: lot. And then it goes back down. It goes below. And then it goes back up.
894.24s: The other thing I want you to notice is the slope of this channel. We have one endpoint here.
901.36s: This is for a five year weekly chart. We have one endpoint here. So let's take a look at this from
909.28s: this midpoint here is at 2865. Now this is after the COVID crash. So actually, let's zoom this
916.48s: out even more. Let's do a 10 year and we'll clean those off. Let's use a 10 year chart.
922.48s: So 10 year chart, we have 20.7 here. And then back here, we have 16. 16 to 20.7. So it's four points.
936.96s: Let's take a look at an example together. Now I want you as we're doing this, I want you to
941.52s: remember what we're doing. We're understanding why volatility itself is an interesting asset class.
950.64s: So the difference here from 16 call it to what is this 20 20.7. The difference between 16 and 20.7
963.44s: is a 29.38% slope in terms of absolute return. That means from here to here, we've moved 29%
975.12s: obviously. It's a smaller asset, so a smaller move. Let's now keep the same chart 10 year monthly,
981.52s: but let's go to SPX. What do you notice right out of the gate? What do you notice? There's a couple
988.32s: things that should strike you as very different than what we just looked at.
998.56s: This should help you understand what mean reversion actually is. Now, not to get too far off
1010.08s: topic and get into the world of mean reversion too much, but the other thing we have to pay attention
1015.44s: is time frame. When we're comparing long term mid term short term, because if you look on a shorter
1022.72s: term cycle, first, let's start with the comparison we were doing in the other one. What's the
1027.92s: difference between these two points? This is going to tell us the slope. This is going to tell us
1033.20s: how much has this changed over the same reference period compared to the other. So it starts down here
1039.52s: at 1645. Let's log that here 1645. And then it caps out here at 5197. 5197.
1053.68s: It's a 216% return from here to here. Compare that to the 20% return that you saw
1066.40s: in VIX here. The point that I'm making is that in a long term time frame, something like equities
1077.44s: do not exhibit mean reversion. They exhibit drift. Very different function.
1086.56s: Mean reversion is essentially a compelling force where as things move out of a band,
1094.40s: they are literally migrated back into a relation of the original band. In this case, the line of best
1102.80s: fit of the standard deviation channel. You do not see that on SPX. Why does this matter? Why am I
1110.16s: spending so much time at the beginning of this in terms of recapping this point? Why trade options?
1117.12s: Why am I spending so much time on this point about mean reversion and volatility? It's because as
1122.32s: an options trader, you literally gain access to one of the most predictable, the most predictable
1131.20s: market functions that exist volatility in mean reversion. You get that right here. You do not get
1139.36s: that with price. Price sometimes will go up a day in a row. Well, this is a month. Sometimes it'll
1145.04s: go up a month in a row. Sometimes it'll go up seven months in a row. Then it will be down one up,
1149.68s: one up. It'll be all over the place. Now, one admin note. When we're talking about
1157.04s: order term time frames, price in equities driven by sentiment can exhibit some elements of mean
1165.76s: reversion. But it's not true mean reversion because the difference is exactly as I've painted for
1170.48s: you here. This is appreciated over 200% over this time frame. There's nothing that's pulling it down
1177.28s: every time it goes up. It's pulling it down a little bit, but then net net. It's moving up higher
1183.28s: over time. That's called drift. When we look at something like VIX, it's the opposite. Literally
1189.60s: VIX starts to pop a lot. It literally gets ripped back down. This is exactly why for those that were
1197.28s: in some of the live streams throughout the past week is soon as VIX cracked above 20 literally
1202.48s: recently. I had just spoke about trading it and trading it to the downside. I gave two different
1208.32s: ways that a trader could trade it to the downside. I actually suggested people paper trade it.
1213.36s: You could see how this works. You can either do it via short puts, which is a little anti-intuitive
1218.96s: that's more of a volatility specific kind of approach. Or you could literally just trade it
1223.20s: directionally. If you'll recall what I said is if you trade this directionally and you do something
1229.28s: like buy puts, you're not going to make much money on it. Why did I say you're not going to make
1234.00s: much money on it? Because everybody fucking knows this exact thing. But highly tradable.
1243.92s: So going back to this, these are the reasons why options can be so interesting to trade and why
1254.88s: they can be so lucrative. Okay, cool. Next one, key market participants. Last time we connected,
1260.88s: we spoke about this graph art thing here. And the cliff notes version of this section and why it
1268.96s: matters is because we are small fish in a big pond. We have to learn some of our advantages
1277.52s: and how we can play those advantages. Because in general, we have very, very few of them.
1284.08s: So some of the advantages of retail traders is that we're very small. It means that we can trade
1291.20s: things that are literally too small for larger institutions to get into. Sometimes this is where
1296.48s: you can find true edge because it can't be tackled by larger entities that have the resources that
1303.84s: can see things that look really appealing there. But it's just too small. It just doesn't make
1308.08s: sense for them anymore. The other thing is our ability to move around however we need to.
1319.84s: And what I mean by that is we can be full long one day, full short the next day for a lot of
1325.20s: people that kind of movement actually can lead to negative performance because we get whipsawed,
1329.84s: we don't have a defined plan. But if you learn to master that, it allows you to move much more
1334.48s: quickly with the market. You essentially are riding the tide, the coattails of the larger participants.
1341.04s: That's the cool part about being a retail trader. Is there is a small niche for us that we can operate
1347.12s: that even as a small retail trader, meaning you have sub 50 million dollars essentially,
1353.84s: you have plenty of room to move around. Once you start getting above like 25, 50 mil, then you do
1359.76s: start running into some positioning problems. You're kind of like the size of a small fund almost
1364.64s: at that point. Really once you get over 100 mil. Okay, the next thing, when do we decide to trade an
1371.60s: option versus the underlying? We already talked about options adding complexity options give us more
1377.76s: things that we have to track and pay attention to. So when would we want to trade options as compared
1384.24s: to the underlying? There are a few instances, and that's cool part. There's really not a whole
1388.40s: lot of them. There's just a few instances. In general, equity outright is a simpler position.
1395.76s: So if I wanted to trade options instead of equity outright, why might I do that? Well, one of the
1401.04s: first reasons is for leverage. I can control. This is an old thing obviously before the split
1407.84s: and Nvidia. But it's a good example because at the time that I made this, Nvidia was trading at
1414.08s: 11.05. And if I wanted to buy 100 shares of Nvidia, I need to put up 110K. The option equivalent at
1422.08s: that point was 15K. That's leverage. I am controlling a much larger amount of money, which a much
1427.68s: smaller amount of money. So that's one of the reasons why we might decide to trade options.
1433.04s: The other thing is if we want to isolate other profit mechanisms, meaning if I want to trade
1438.16s: something that's going sideways and actually capitalize on volatility, or if I just want to capitalize
1442.72s: on theta and take in risk premium, that's another completely viable approach. So the main times we look
1450.40s: to add options is when they make sense. The way they make sense is if we're doing things like this,
1457.68s: that are specific to an asset like options and are not available in something like equities.
1464.40s: I make this point because sometimes traders can make the mistake of automatically always defaulting
1473.60s: to something like options. And that's not always the right answer. Because let's say that I have
1478.56s: a portfolio. I don't really care how much money I'm using because it's a large enough portfolio.
1482.72s: And I'm going to be controlled more by risk than position size. And I put on something. And
1489.84s: when the trade goes on, I can either put it on with options or equities. Well, if I don't care
1494.64s: how much money I'm using, and I don't want the leverage because I can put on the size that I want
1499.76s: in the underlying itself, I just use the Delta one. I just use the underlying because now I don't
1504.72s: have to deal with days to expiration. Now I don't have to deal with Vega as volatility changes
1509.20s: and how that impacts the premium of my option. I don't have to deal with
1513.52s: slowly dealing with theta decay as the premium is eroding out day over day of those options.
1519.44s: So the point is just avoid automatically backing into something because there can be other periods,
1526.24s: other approaches that might make sense. Okay, so now we can get into the session for today.
1532.80s: Reading an options chain literally is going to be done as we go through this. So close that down.
1539.04s: Open this one up. Here we are buying versus selling options. First thing, let me update our
1548.32s: little timestamp here. We are at 26 minutes. This is for anybody that wants to rewatch these.
1557.28s: So this will be buying versus selling. Okay, so when we look at an options chain, we know,
1567.52s: let's grab a ticker. Let's grab something like so-fi. Just grab an random ticker.
1576.24s: And if we go into the options chain, if you guys have any questions on how to read this, let me know.
1580.80s: The expectation is most people for this will at least be somewhat familiar with what this thing
1586.80s: looks like and how to read it. So looking at the options chain, we can see that there's a bunch of
1594.72s: different expressions, a bunch of different vultilities that are specific, all relative to the
1600.32s: expiration duration itself. We can click in here and we can see all our different strike prices.
1605.44s: We can see calls on the left, puts on the right, all that kind of stuff. So this number here is
1612.24s: premium. What the fuck is premium? One of the things you'll notice in options trading in
1619.04s: finance in general is we use a lot of stupid words to make shit more confusing than it needs to be.
1626.32s: And this is an artifact of that. This is simply the value. This is equivalent of the stock price.
1632.72s: This the premium is the stock price effective of an option itself. So this 17 call is currently bid
1643.28s: at 132 offered at 135. So what this means is right now the most somebody is willing to buy it for
1651.60s: as a dollar 32, the cheapest somebody is willing to sell it for as a dollar 35. Typically, what's
1657.92s: resting here will be orders placed by market makers. They rest orders to provide liquidity. And they
1664.32s: have specific regulations on how much they need to offer liquidity, meaning how often they have to
1670.72s: have their quote machines turned on and provide those numbers. Now they can fuck with those numbers.
1675.28s: They can make it really illiquid. They can make it really unattractive, but they still have to provide it.
1680.96s: So we're faced with the choice. The first choice with every single option is do we want to buy it or
1690.16s: do we want to sell it? The way we answer that is pretty simple. And on the slide, we're going to go
1698.08s: through a series of decisions together. Then I want to give you some considerations to keep in mind
1705.44s: as you apply this practically. And then at the end, I want to walk through actually structuring
1712.48s: a few trades with you in making the decision together live on current names that are happening
1717.84s: right now if we might want to buy or sell. So first, let's start with understanding the differences
1725.28s: between buying and selling premium. The first thing is we know, hopefully we should know. Let me grab
1735.04s: one. I need a, you know, like a peacock. I got to be able to draw. I need this up here so I could
1740.96s: draw. Let me draw. Here we go. We're ready to rock. Beautiful. Grab my notepad.
1752.48s: So the first thing we have to identify is that we have an options contract.
1764.00s: And we know for every single options contract, there are two people.
1771.60s: Fire and a seller. Typically, there's a facilitating party in the center of this.
1782.48s: Which is a market maker. The main point I want you to take away from this section is that there are
1789.04s: two components, a buyer and a seller. Every single contract needs a buyer and a seller. Think of
1797.36s: your insurance for anything that you have insurance on. There are two parties to your insurance.
1805.04s: The first party to your insurance, this is actually better done here. The first party to your
1811.60s: insurance is you. You want insurance. You're going to buy insurance. You're the first party.
1817.84s: The second party is the insurance provider. Whoever the agency is, all state, state, farm,
1823.84s: whoever you're going through for your insurance. One entity is selling the insurance. The other
1832.00s: entity is buying the insurance. That insurance has a contract. There are different rules that apply
1839.76s: to the insurance that typically amount to how can we not pay you but take your money,
1845.84s: you know, standard insurance. So that's an insurance contract. It's the same thing in options.
1853.60s: In options, there's a contract with two components, two people that are tied to that contract.
1863.12s: So let's start now with understanding the differences between those two perspectives.
1876.40s: I'm grabbing an overview somewhere.
1883.04s: Here we go. We're not going to go through this whole thing. It doesn't really matter.
1888.56s: I want you to specifically focus on this section. So this section here gives you an outline of what
1899.84s: things look like for the buyer of an option as compared to a seller. And again, just keep the
1906.32s: insurance thing in the back of your brain because that's kind of what it is. If you think about the
1911.04s: purchaser of an insurance, they're paying a premium. I'm giving you money. And the deal is
1919.44s: if there's a covered loss, you cover the loss. The point and why people buy insurance beyond
1929.68s: the insurance that's just literally legally mandated, it's to reduce severity. What that means is
1936.08s: I might pay two two hundred bucks a month, whatever it is for my insurance. And I just
1942.32s: pay that two hundred bucks every month. I can fit it into the budget, losing the two hundred
1945.84s: bucks isn't fun, but I can stomach it. It's okay. And then if I have a covered loss, let's say that
1951.28s: there's unfortunately a car accident and the car is totaled. Well, let's say I'm found at fault
1957.20s: in some capacity. Maybe it wasn't my fault at all, but somebody hits my car, totals, it drives
1962.80s: away. We have no idea who they are. Well, then me as the consumer as the end point, the buyer of
1968.08s: the insurance, well, I'm like, shit, I don't want to go buy a $60,000 car. That's a lot of money to
1973.28s: come up with at once to replace this thing. And I don't want to pick up a car payment that's
1976.96s: going to be double whatever my prices, which fun fact offshoot, you should never have a car payment.
1982.56s: You should never have a car payment. One of the worst possible kinds of payments you can have.
1986.56s: It's dumb. You don't have a car payment. Just buy a car that fits within your budget.
1991.44s: That aside, you don't want to come up with the money out of pocket.
1996.72s: So that's the point of insurance. I pay $200 every month to make sure that if some shit happens,
2005.76s: I'm covered and it reduces my overall severity. Even if in the aggregate, I pay more than the
2014.24s: value of the car over the entire life cycle of the car. I'm okay with that. And the reason I'm okay
2019.76s: with that is because it reduces the severity so that I'm not stuck having to pay $60,000 at one
2025.52s: point in time. So the buyer receives something. Now, the difference in the departure from options
2039.44s: versus insurance is the way settlement occurs because in options, the buyer, if it's an American
2049.44s: style option, they can exercise whenever they want, even if it doesn't make sense, they can.
2059.44s: So a big, big difference in something to be aware of in options, especially specifically,
2064.40s: American style option is that they can be exercised at any point in time. The seller,
2069.76s: it's to be aware of that because you can be on the hook to deliver whatever your end of the
2075.36s: bargain is, whether you've sold a call or sold a put two different scenarios. And you can see those
2081.52s: down here, I purposely give you and I recommend grab a screenshot. I actually think what's better
2086.40s: is you make your own, the process of making your own is valuable. But this here just gives you a
2092.88s: quick little cheat sheet on how these things move with respect to stock price volatility and then
2099.68s: opening closing transactions and who's on the hook to do what. But what you'll notice is that the
2105.68s: seller is on the hook to do some shit. If you sell a call, you're on the hook to buy, I'm sorry,
2113.84s: you're on the hook to sell shares. So if you sell a, if you sell a call, you're on the hook to sell
2119.36s: somebody shares at a set price, the strike price. And then if you sell the put, you're on the hook,
2127.12s: the buy shares. One thing to know is that the majority of options are closed before expiration.
2136.96s: So the majority of instances will not include these transactions here. And it's because in general,
2143.76s: they're just inefficient. It doesn't make sense. And we can get into that at another point in time. But
2149.44s: the way to think of it is when we talk about the premium of an option, the premium of an option
2155.28s: has a couple key components. One of them is time value. When you exercise your option, whether you
2160.96s: bought a caller or put and you exercise it, you give up your time value that otherwise you could
2166.56s: recover. So that's why in general, it doesn't make sense. Now again, there's nuances to this that
2172.16s: we can get into at some point. Okay. So to recap what we just talked about, we now understand the
2178.96s: perspective of buyers. We now understand the perspective of sellers. We now understand that people
2184.48s: that sell calls have an obligation to sell shares at a certain price. We now know that people that
2190.80s: sell puts have the obligation to buy shares at a certain price. We also now know that in general,
2197.52s: it doesn't make sense to exercise the option. So what does that tell you? It tells us that most of us
2203.20s: are trading the options contract itself without necessarily why going into why
2213.84s: got to real learn says, oh, I understand why selling puts can be bullish. Bingo. There you go.
2218.08s: That's exactly correct. So this becomes a useful exercise and we can sell options by options,
2225.76s: depending on what we're trying to do. But most of us are simply trading the contract. And we're
2230.56s: using those unique aspects of an options contract that we talked about earlier as the rationale for
2236.56s: trading and options contract. So quick pause here after we just talked a whole lot about
2245.68s: premium of an option buying, selling. Are there any questions? And in the meantime, I'm going to
2251.68s: update our timestamps. So premium, buying, selling, settlement, and that's pretty good.
2268.56s: Any questions on any of this stuff?
2270.40s: I made like a liquid IV, but I've watered it down too much. So it just kind of tastes like
2282.88s: slightly, slightly off flavored water.
2288.88s: Lauren says I have questions, but I think they might be answered later looking at your sidebar. Sure.
2292.96s: Well, let's get over to that now because that's the next step.
2297.84s: The next step in this process is comparing buying versus selling options kind of line by line.
2305.84s: So let's do that now. So we're at 3830. And we are talking about combining or comparing to
2315.28s: buying first, selling option. And then don't worry because at the end, I'm literally going to give
2322.56s: you like a specific framework. And it's not like Eric secret framework. There's nothing secret
2328.24s: about this shit. It's just to give you a way to think about this so that it at least makes sense.
2335.20s: Now I'm going to slide this over just a little bit so that my head isn't directly over this.
2339.76s: I think it's good now. And let's kick off. So the difference between buying and selling. We're
2346.08s: going to start with the entering transaction. Pretty simple. When we're buying something,
2351.92s: we're buying to open. When we're selling something, we're selling to open BTO STO.
2359.52s: Now what this means is if I'm buying to open, it means that I'm giving money. And after I give
2366.16s: the money, I have an open position. Selling to open means I am taking money. I am receiving money.
2373.04s: We call it a credit. I get a credit. And then I have an open position. When we're buying, it is a
2378.96s: debit. So the inverse is the inverse. Pretty simple. Probably can move through this part a little
2386.16s: quickly because I don't think this should be a big shock. We're just going to do the opposite of
2390.88s: what we did to get in. And again, for those that are wondering, this is how the majority of options
2398.08s: contracts are going to be settled is through this transaction process of buying and selling just
2402.72s: like that. Okay. Risk profile. Now we start getting into the differences. The differences that
2410.08s: matter a lot. So one of the first differences here is you'll notice that if I buy premium,
2418.08s: I have defined risk. That means the most I can lose is whatever I bought it for. And if I sell
2425.36s: premium, I have undefined risk. That means I can lose a non-symmetric amount to whatever I
2433.44s: collected up front. So let's take a quick look at what this can look like. We'll stay in so
2437.68s: if I just because we're here, let's keep it on the 17 call just because and let's take a look at
2441.84s: buying and selling the same call. And let's do... Yep, this is fine. So let's get rid of this. I'm
2453.36s: actually going to do the opposite trade as well in the same spot. Let's delete this. So it's out
2457.92s: of the way. And let's take a look first at buying it. This is called a risk profile. So risk
2463.20s: profile, you can plot this for yourself. You literally can make this in Excel. It's super simple.
2467.52s: It just looks across different strike prices and then different PNLs based on... I'm sorry, this is
2472.88s: in strike prices. This is prices of the underlying. And it looks at different PNLs at different values
2479.20s: of the underlying. So here, notice two things. The first thing is the loss component, which is what's
2486.96s: below zero on the y-axis here. And you can see that it levels off. It's flat. That means once you get
2494.48s: to that point, so all you got. And again, think of it logically. If I pay $100 for something,
2503.04s: that's what I give up. That $100. Even though if, let's say I'm flipping shoes, I know people do
2509.28s: that, which is just such a crazy thing to me because I don't know anything about shoes. But somebody
2514.88s: will pay for shoes. You give money upfront and then you get the shoes. And then the idea is that
2520.56s: the shoes might be worth more if you're good at this. So you're given the money upfront, you get
2525.52s: the shoes. And then later, you're going to try to give the shoes to somebody and collect more money.
2530.32s: The same thing that's going on here. But if you buy those shoes and then those shoes turn out to be
2534.96s: worthless because they're fake, the most you can lose is whatever you paid upfront for those shoes.
2540.56s: Same thing here. So when you're buying an option, the most you can lose is what you pay for the option.
2545.52s: The inverse occurs when we sell options. You'll notice that if I squish this down and we go further
2553.28s: and further and further and further and further out and we see so far, I imagine I've never actually
2558.32s: done this. I'm curious how far this goes. 900 that this is actually kind of fun. I'm not going to lie.
2564.32s: 41 million. It's got to stop at some point.
2570.64s: 600 million, 30 billion. I did not think that this would go into the billions. This is crazy.
2578.16s: If this goes into trillions, I'll stop after trillions because I cannot believe that this is still going.
2590.16s: Oh no, it's stuck. I think we're stuck. No, we're still in the billions. This is crazy.
2601.68s: Okay. Well, anyways, the point hopefully is proved because now it can't even calculate it.
2609.36s: It literally just says infinite. So what this is actually showing you though is you have unlimited
2616.80s: risk in the direction that it goes against you. Now it's not truly unlimited risk. It's just
2624.96s: really big risk. It's not truly unlimited risk because sooner or later is weird as this is
2633.20s: going to sound sooner or later, the world literally runs out of resources. Right? There's only
2641.84s: so much value on planet earth of things at a given point in time. This is theoretical and conversation,
2648.72s: but I want the point to be clear. So what that means is even though we can just chart this of going
2655.04s: into the hundreds of billions of dollars in terms of stock price, that's not in terms of market
2660.72s: cap. That's in terms of stock price. There comes to be a natural cap in terms of literally what
2667.04s: code what is the total amount of value that literally exists today. So just be aware of that. It's
2674.24s: the same thing to the downside. When we sell an option like if we sell a put, we typically say that
2679.84s: the risk profile is undefined, which is always comical to me. It's actually defined, right? A stock
2686.40s: can go to zero. That's defined, but we refer to it as undefined risk. The reason why we refer to
2695.28s: it as undefined risk is that it can go to those extremes and it can go as far along those extremes
2702.88s: technically as it wants. Now the reality is obviously that's not how price works. It's not very
2708.88s: frequent that you see stocks go to zero. And I've never seen a hundred million dollar stock price
2716.08s: for a stock, right? So there becomes natural limitations to it. But the point I'm making is that
2723.92s: defined versus undefined. A travel says when you sell an option, don't you also know the max you
2729.76s: can lose as long as you do not do naked? For example, on selling a put, is the strike minus premium
2737.84s: received? There's not a max loss. That's incorrect. So travel says so it is undefined, but there is a
2746.32s: max loss. Nope, that's incorrect. What you're calculating there is your break even point, which
2752.56s: actually is a couple away from here. But say for example, you sell, what did you do? You use an
2760.24s: example of selling a put. If you sell a put and you have your strike price less the credit received,
2767.44s: that's just giving you your break even point. You still have undefined risk of that option.
2772.96s: Technically, technically undefined risk as I was talking about before, the stock can only go to zero.
2783.04s: A travel says no max. I can lose because I get assigned and the underlying goes to zero.
2791.36s: Correct. That's literally the point I was just making is that we refer to it as undefined.
2797.36s: But on that option, it still has technically undefined risk, even for a short put. To your point,
2804.72s: it's defined down at zero, right? And same thing like I was just making the point of going all the
2810.32s: way to the upside, making the hypothetical that so far is trading at $100 million in terms of
2815.84s: stock price. We've never seen anything even close to that. You literally run out of resources,
2821.76s: literally on earth to call the value infinite of any stock. Any stock is going to have a cap
2831.20s: somewhere. Now the commensurate value can slowly rise and whatnot. But the value, literally the
2837.52s: value on earth is not infinite. So the main point is when we're referring to short options as
2845.60s: undefined, we're talking about the severity. That's the primary point. So even in the example of
2851.28s: a short put, it technically speaking has undefined risk down to zero. Just as any of these stocks have
2858.40s: undefined risk up to whatever price it can go to, which leads to the profile, which is the inverse.
2865.92s: So the reward is what you make and we just saw this on those options. So if we buy an option,
2871.76s: we have undefined profit, but to find risk. If we sell options, we have undefined risk, but to find
2877.12s: profit. Begs the question. Who the fuck would do this? Why would I do this? Why on earth would I
2887.44s: accept unlimited risk, but limited profit from just a logical perspective that in and of itself
2898.00s: makes no fucking sense? It makes absolutely no sense to do something like that. But there are
2907.76s: specific reasons why it actually does make sense in practice, which we'll talk about. So let's take a
2916.08s: look at the next one. This is one of those reasons. Because when you buy premium, you need the stock
2927.28s: to move. The stock has to move. And you also need the stock to move in your direction,
2937.76s: has to move in your direction. If it doesn't, you will slowly start losing money. So if we go back
2944.80s: to this example, let's go back to this long option, you'll notice that there are two lines purple
2949.84s: and blue. Purple represents today. Blue represents at expiration. Notice how the purple line right now
2958.00s: is much higher than the blue line. Why is the purple line higher than the blue line? Because of
2963.52s: X, intrinsic value, time value. What ends up happening is with current price right now,
2971.84s: if I buy this option right now, the 17 call, and I buy it with the stock price at 1657, you'll notice
2979.76s: that I need this to move in order for me to make anything at expiration. You need the stock price
2992.64s: above your strike price plus the premium to make any money with a long call. What you don't need
3001.68s: is the stock price above your strike price in order to make money before that time.
3012.08s: What this means is right now, the strike price is 17 and paying a dollar 35. Strike price is 17,
3021.04s: stock is at 1657. Let's zoom this in a little bit so that you can see a little easier. Let's pretend
3028.24s: that the stock goes to 1675. Stock moves to 1675. That's not my strike price yet,
3037.84s: but I will make money. If I go to 1675, I make $7.77 today. That doesn't include the passage of
3050.24s: time yet. That is if it happens today. This is to short circuit a really common misconception of
3058.48s: people who buy options that think the underlying has to go past your strike in order to make money,
3067.60s: and it doesn't. It does only at expiration. Before expiration, I'm showing you right now,
3076.16s: an example where that is not the case. This is a really small case of it because the numbers
3083.04s: are so close. 1657 to 17. Let me show you another example quickly that will hopefully make this
3089.28s: point even more clear. Let's pick something that's super far out of the money. Let's pick the 25s.
3094.40s: It doesn't have to go to 25 before you make money. My strike is all the way over here at 25. What do
3101.44s: you notice about that purple line before we get there? The stock can rally to 20. I would pay
3113.20s: $17.17 for this option right now looking at the $21.25 call and I would make $55. This is where you
3123.76s: see people placing and placing options trades and saying, I made 5,800% that's going to be tied to
3132.48s: a smaller, cheap out of the money option that compounded a lot that compounding is due to gamma,
3138.96s: which we'll talk about later.
3139.92s: Let's go back here and let's take a look now at the selling premium component that has that
3156.40s: built in buffer. If I sell a call and right now, Spot Price is 1657, what do you notice that's
3167.12s: different than if I sell that call versus buying it? The stock cannot move at all. If it doesn't move
3176.08s: before we get into expiration, I make the maximum amount of money I can on this trade if it doesn't
3184.00s: move at all. The other thing you'll notice is that even if it moves against me a little bit,
3192.08s: I can still make money. Won't be max profit, but I can still make money. This is a big difference
3199.20s: between selling and buying and this is one of the benefits of selling is you have a built in
3206.32s: buffer to be wrong. But notice the difference here. Take a look at the purple line to the blue line.
3214.00s: At this point right here at 1740, that means that the underlying would have rallied against me,
3221.92s: if I sell a call it's bearish, so the rally would be against the position. It would rally against
3227.12s: the position about one point. That's still, if you look at the blue line, still in profit,
3234.88s: but today it's not. I would be showing a loss of $44. Even though if I held that position,
3242.80s: and I took it into expiration, it would be worth this case 95. I would literally make money
3249.84s: even though the underlying moved against me. That's another one of the benefits of selling.
3255.20s: Okay, relationship with volatility. Really, really simple. This is the standard relationship of long
3260.80s: options versus short options. Long options, enjoy expanding volatility and shrinking volatility
3269.04s: decreases the extrinsic value, decreases the value of the option.
3273.28s: So to make this point, I don't know, I honestly don't know the general understanding of most of
3278.80s: the people that are in here. So I'm going to draw this out really quick so that hopefully will make sense.
3286.64s: So if we have, let me get this keyboard out of the way. If we have a premium, so let's say it's
3294.08s: a dollar premium and we break this premium out, it will have intrinsic
3302.56s: and extrinsic value. Let's say that this option is out of the money.
3312.80s: That means that there is zero intrinsic value, not. And then extrinsic value is broken down
3321.76s: into two sub components. I'm
3327.84s: and vol. The reason why there are two sub components in here is volatility lives essentially
3338.08s: volatility essentially lives in time. But there's separate factors because time is linear.
3348.56s: I know the days to expiration. I know the expiration of every single option out there.
3357.12s: So I inherently know how much time I should decay out per day based on the time input itself.
3365.92s: It's linear time is linear. The non-linear component to this is volatility. Because if something is
3373.68s: more volatile, it's more likely to have bigger moves. If something is less volatile,
3381.52s: it has smaller moves. So then the value of that option is different.
3388.88s: Lawrence says, I thought volatility made profits from call options go down. It depends on which
3393.68s: side of the trade your own. So it inherently does not do that. Volatility impacts options
3401.20s: like this. Let me hide this so it's not your way.
3409.92s: Here. Notice how there's no catty corner relationship here, meaning it impacts one call or put,
3417.52s: depending on what you've done differently. What it is entirely based on is if you're long or short
3426.72s: the option. So get rid of this component for now. Just make all this go away in your brain.
3439.84s: I didn't mean to do that. I thought there was like a fill color. That's not it either.
3446.08s: What I was trying to do is hide this. But what I want you to think about is all options. Every single one
3453.36s: of them call, put all of them. All options across the board, all of them. Their premium will go up
3464.16s: if volatility goes up. All of them calls and puts. If volatility goes down, all options,
3472.16s: calls or puts, the premium will contract all of them across the board. They will be obviously different
3480.32s: levels of severity, different scale, depending on the other Greeks of the option. But it affects them
3487.68s: it affects them all in this way. So now it depends if this change in volatility if it helps or hurts
3499.76s: my position is if I've bought or sold the option. Because remember, if I buy something, I want it to
3508.80s: be worth more in the future. So if I buy a call or if I buy a put, volatility expanding helps me.
3517.92s: My option is now worth more. It's the inverse if I sell. But I'm selling options. I want to sell
3523.52s: something high and then buy it back to cover lower cheaper. So if volatility goes up, that hurts my
3532.08s: position. Whether it's a color put, if I sold it, it's going to hurt me. So the way to think about
3538.16s: volatility's impact on options is think of it in terms of the impact on all options. There's new
3544.40s: wants, right? We're obviously talking about things in a vacuum. We're talking about no changes in time
3550.24s: and all that kind of stuff. There's layers that will factor on to it. But Cedrus Parabus, everything
3554.88s: else remaining the same. If we move this component, that's what you will see. So good question.
3563.12s: Okay. Let us continue down. Capital requirement is different. Whether you buy or sell premium.
3572.96s: Capital requirement when you buy is whatever you paid. You're going to pay that out of your cash
3577.36s: and sweep. When you sell premium, you're actually going to collect money upfront that's going to go
3582.88s: into your cash and sweep. However, there's going to be a margin requirement. The margin requirement
3589.84s: can be different. If you're in a cash security account and you try to sell a call, it won't let
3594.80s: you because you can't cash secure a short call. There's no cash securing it. It's undefined.
3601.76s: If you want to sell a put, you can cash secure a put because you can take a Simon of the underlying
3611.20s: and hold the equity itself. And then your max risk and the equity is the value of the equity.
3617.12s: So a little bit different. Now in the context of like a regulation T margin account or a portfolio
3623.68s: margin account, they calculate the margin requirement differently. The way to think about margin
3629.28s: requirements is it's essentially your broker's method to put the risk of the position onto you.
3636.32s: They're not going to take the risk for you. So what that means is they're very guarded against
3641.20s: people having a bunch of options positions on because if there's some sort of big move that
3646.80s: goes against you and you lose on a bunch of these options positions and you don't have the money
3651.04s: in the account for it, they've now just taken your risk because they still have to make that position
3656.08s: whole. So that's why when markets become more volatile, typically speaking, you will see margin
3662.56s: requirements go up because your broker is essentially saying, I see more risk out there today.
3668.72s: I'm not going to take that risk for you. You're going to have to put some more money in this account
3672.08s: to cover that risk. This is what we call a margin call to satisfy a margin call. You have to add
3678.16s: money into the account. Otherwise, there's a chance your broker will start liquidating your positions
3683.76s: for you and that's to reduce the broker's risk. Okay. Greeks, this one, I'm a little hesitant to put up
3694.48s: but we'll see how this goes for you guys. When you're buying premium, you're going to be short
3701.68s: theta long game a long row. Feel good? That makes sense? Partially joking, but partially not.
3715.76s: We'll go through them all. There are a bunch of different Greeks. People have so many misconceptions
3734.40s: about the Greeks and we're here to clarify as many as we can. So let me update our little time stamp
3743.44s: here. This will be Greek impacts, you're buying or selling. We are at 10230. Beautiful. Right on schedule.
3758.48s: Let's take a look at some examples. Notice how I'm not saying if your long calls, long puts, short calls,
3766.48s: short puts, I'm talking about it across all options here. Let's keep that in mind. So let's get an
3776.32s: example going. Buy, buy to open a call or a put. Literally a call or a put. It doesn't matter either
3784.48s: one. If I buy one of these, we already know that when you buy an option, you're gaining leverage,
3796.56s: you have defined risk, you have undefined profit. That's a really solid place to be for an investment.
3805.92s: So there are compensatory elements to this that makes this not the Goldilocks scenario that
3814.32s: otherwise this would be. If there were not drawbacks to this, there's nobody that wouldn't do this.
3821.60s: One of those drawbacks is ThetaDK. So ThetaDK simply tells us Theta itself tells us
3835.20s: the rate of decay of an options premium per one day passing. So options decay. The reason why that
3846.40s: matters is because let's take it back to basics. If I bought those sneakers and let's say that
3853.84s: those sneakers had a magical spell on them, where at the end of one week, the sneakers aren't
3860.00s: there anymore. They've fucking decay away into nothing. My goal is to offload these sneakers super
3865.36s: fast because I don't want, I paid $100 for those sneakers. I'm going to try to sell them for more,
3871.04s: because I think they're worth more. But if I hold on to them for too long, they're not going to
3874.64s: be worth anything. That kind of sucks. So to short circuit this magical sneaker scenario,
3882.96s: I'm going to try to move on them quickly. I'm going to try to sell them off quickly and move on with
3887.52s: my day and do the human thing of give somebody else the problem. All right, cool.
3896.88s: ThetaDK is the same for options. Options or contracts, all of these contracts will conclude at
3902.80s: some point. So if we take a look here, let's take a look at a couple scenarios. These are out of
3913.52s: the money options. Let's take a look at the out of the money, 30 delta option here in SoFi.
3918.88s: If we take a look at the 30 delta put, it's bid 80 offered at 82. Now let's go into zero days to
3926.64s: expiration. Let's see if we can find the 30 delta. It won't be there technically.
3933.44s: Since it landed right at 1650, it's actually kind of funny, because it's quoting a penny.
3938.48s: But notice the value of all these options. Zero gone. No value left decayed away out of there.
3947.20s: So when you are buying options, you're paying money upfront and we know that they're
3955.68s: stated decay. Dated decay is the decay of the extrinsic value of the options. So what ends up
3964.00s: happening is as you bought this thing for a dollar, if nothing else changes, but time passes,
3970.40s: it's worth a little bit less each day. Theta is the Greek that tells you how much less. So that you know.
3986.40s: Makes sense so far? I want to isolate this Theta component. So ThetaDK
3994.96s: negatively impacts holders. The inversors for sellers,
4000.64s: they'll to open, call or put. Yeah, ThetaDK.
4010.56s: Now let's talk about a really common misconception for sellers. Sellers, a lot of sellers will
4019.92s: mistakenly tell you that their edge is Theta. There is exactly zero edge in Theta. Theta will not
4033.76s: provide you in ounce of edge. Theta is a linear metric that is known. There's no edge in it.
4044.24s: The reason why they say Theta is their edge is because they collect money and they think
4052.64s: falsely that that provides them a bait in edge. The way to think about in edge in the market is that
4063.28s: if there's any sort of edge that's easily accessible by everybody, there's no edge there.
4072.80s: It's not a thing. So there are risk premiums. And Theta does not even provide you a risk premium
4083.28s: outright. It's the volatility component that provides you a risk premium. We can get into risk
4088.88s: premiums in efficiencies versus edge. Don't even worry about that right now. The way to summarize
4095.12s: this component is sellers benefit from the decaying of an option. Because again, if I
4103.04s: sold something for $100 and then I'm going to look to buy it back, I want to buy it back cheaper.
4111.04s: So that decay helps my position as a seller. Okay, so let me take a pause there. And I would love to
4122.16s: hear if that so far makes sense. Are we on board? Any questions about the difference between these,
4131.36s: why it is what it is, why the behavior is what it is specifically for this Greek. And then,
4138.72s: okay, great. So now let's get into Gamma. Let me update my little thing. We're at 10902.
4145.84s: Oh, two. Let's get it. Gamma. Gamma is the rate of change of delta. So let's go back to basics here.
4163.76s: Every time that we do these, I specifically want you to get into the mental habit of taking it back
4170.08s: to the basics of something. So let's grab the options chain.
4179.20s: And let me grab this again. I'll just clear all that off.
4185.20s: So let's go further out in time here. And here, what happens if I buy this option,
4200.16s: and the price goes up? Well, if the price goes up, my option right now is that a 51 delta,
4211.92s: it will appreciate by 11 cents. This column here is Gamma. Gamma represents movement.
4223.44s: If things start to move, we know that that can impact volatility. That can ultimately benefit our
4234.24s: position. So typically speaking, let's use a simpler example, not of single options, but let's use
4244.96s: a long straddle to show you how the Gamma component works.
4253.04s: What do you notice about this straddle? Does it care if price goes up or if price goes down?
4265.52s: Based on this risk profile, does it have a preference?
4274.48s: Next time I am not watering down the liquid IV, not terrible, but it just doesn't really taste like
4281.60s: much. It's kind of boring. Reese says, no, that's correct. Lauren, where you at? Lauren,
4288.40s: talk to me. Why do you think yes? Why? Yes, Lauren. Lauren, I don't know if you know this. You're
4296.48s: the proxy for the group. So yes or no, you tell me the green line cares.
4312.56s: Lauren, you've got to be fucking with me right now.
4320.64s: That's, I think that has to be what's currently happening. That's the only rational explanation
4327.68s: for this so far. There's not a fucking green line on here. Lauren, are you colorblind? Are you actually
4337.76s: colorblind? Because if so, that's colorblindness, I feel like is one of those afflictions that's so
4343.68s: fun to make fun of, like you can make fun of somebody's disability if they're colorblind. It's not
4350.24s: like making fun of somebody that was born without a leg. Like if you can't see colors, sucks to be you,
4355.68s: but that's also one of those ones that you're just going to be made fun of for. Rightfully so.
4360.16s: So, joking aside, what this is showing you is that it really doesn't care which way it goes.
4367.60s: It technically has a slight preference based on underlying price and where the strike of the
4372.32s: straddle is technically speaking, right? Because this is the 17 strike. So technically speaking.
4381.68s: But if I grab the 16 and a half, which is actually exactly where it landed, it doesn't have one.
4387.52s: Let me see if there's one of them in here. Here we go. This will be a better example.
4394.48s: Yeah, there you go. So this one doesn't really care which way it goes because we're buying
4400.24s: an at the money straddle. What I'm showing you is that you're long options right now. We don't care
4407.44s: which way this goes. That's why this position is long gamma because as long as it moves,
4415.76s: that's all we want. We just want it to move up or down. Don't care. Just want it to move.
4422.24s: Gamma helps us understand the rates of change of delta. Gamma is the ultimate way that this
4429.36s: ends up making money is if it gets in a accommodating move big enough to overcome
4436.16s: ad expiration to be outside the break even points before expiration doesn't care as long as it
4441.68s: moves either way. It doesn't care it on. So this is why buying premium, depending on the premium,
4450.96s: will be long gamma in some capacity. Now it's a little bit different because if you
4457.60s: use single options, you can have single option positions that benefit from favorable gamma moves.
4466.24s: So it's a little bit of nuance in there. The main thing to think about is gamma,
4471.84s: like if gamma expands or if gamma starts to increase, that means that volatility is increasing,
4479.12s: which feeds back into the options. Now the actual impact of selling a single option, buying a single
4485.68s: option, not all gamma would help a position. So when we say long gamma, we're talking about all
4493.36s: of gamma increasing, not the change of gamma as the underlying moves. So let me clarify that point
4501.44s: a little bit. What ends up happening is this number here gamma represents the rate of change of
4510.08s: delta. And gamma helps us understand how volatile something is. If we're trading something that's
4517.20s: a little bit more volatile, you will find that the gamma numbers as a raw number, the gamma
4524.24s: will be higher. And then the gamma as a relative number to the price of the underlying will be higher
4529.52s: because it's expected to move more. That again is essentially a proxy for volatility. If gamma
4536.08s: starts to increase, it means volatility is increasing. If gamma is contracting, that means volatility is
4541.92s: decreasing. That means that the overall values of the options will be decreasing. Now the reason why
4549.04s: it's kind of nuanced and there's two levels to think about this one is because if I buy this call
4555.28s: here, that means net net, I'm long gamma. But if this moves against me by a dollar here,
4566.08s: like goes this direction, well, gamma is actually hurting me in that case. That's not good.
4573.52s: So two different ways to think of it. The way I want you to think of it for the context of this
4578.96s: conversation here is long gamma as a general metric across the volatility surface, across
4586.56s: aspirations across strikes. Now, row, row is actually really easy, believe it or not. And row
4593.84s: doesn't impact stuff that much. So this one should be pretty easy to understand.
4599.76s: Row tells us how much options, the rate of change of an options premium relative to changes in
4608.56s: interest rates. Interest rates matter across different time frames. So one of the really common
4617.28s: misconceptions you'll see is people will say like, oh, this is a direct reflection of the
4623.68s: federal funds rate or the sofa rate or things like that. And it's not. It is tied to it for sure
4631.44s: because both of those rates will impact the broader rate environment. But it's different for
4637.68s: different aspirations, right? So something like a sofa rate is pretty short term in nature.
4642.32s: If I'm trading something like this, that's 364 days out, the overnight rate is important.
4652.96s: But there's a different rate that's appropriate for this duration as compared to a really short term
4658.16s: duration. So just think of it this way again across all options, just like we looked at volatility
4665.60s: from before. Remember how we said volatility, whether it's a caller or put, doesn't matter,
4670.00s: cross all options if volatility goes up, it makes options more expensive, right? So then that would
4676.24s: naturally benefit buyers and naturally heard sellers. It's the same, it's literally the same exact
4680.72s: thing with row. If interest rates go up, options become more expensive. That's immediately going to
4688.00s: buyers. It's immediately going to hurt sellers. So gamma and row, gamma's a little more confusing
4696.80s: row, I think is pretty straightforward. Okay. Time to take a pause before we get into a little
4704.00s: bit of Prak app. We have a little longer left. I'm not in a big rush and I want to make sure that
4708.40s: you guys get this stuff. So let's do any questions on this stuff first. Okay. Reese, oh no, your
4716.16s: answer and somebody which is good. EHodge says gamma is how much the delta of a contract moves per
4723.52s: dollar. Yep. That's exactly correct. We typically refer to it as a one point move. It's just like
4731.12s: a dollar is fine. The reason why we call it a one point move is because there are some things
4735.84s: that move in handles like options on futures and stuff, which is just a little bit different.
4740.96s: But yeah, it's per dollar move. That's fine. You'll also heard it referred to as one point move,
4748.24s: which is really annoying, by the way, because when we're talking about points in relation to
4754.08s: percentages, it's different than like a one point move in relation to the underlying, which would
4759.20s: be synonymous with the dollar as compared to percentages of percentages. You know, just another
4765.12s: little fun quirk to completely annoy the living share out of everybody trying to learn this stuff.
4771.84s: Thanks, markets. Cool. So it seems like so far we're good. Let's talk about two things now. These
4785.44s: should be pretty quick. Some costly misconceptions and then making the decision on when to buy versus
4794.88s: ones. So I'm going to update our timestamps, costly misconceptions, of buying
4808.24s: pieces like type over here, buying for selling. And yeah, we'll just start there.
4815.92s: Beautiful. Okay. So the decision between buying and selling becomes really simple once we
4829.12s: understand the individual inputs. One of the big mistakes that people make is before they even
4836.16s: start looking at what they're doing, they immediately try to answer should I buy or sell.
4842.00s: And that approach doesn't really make sense because we need more information before we make the
4849.76s: choice to buy or sell. Now, there's another video. I'm going to link to it in the chat there and
4857.28s: then I'll also link to it in the timestamps when they come out. But that video is literally,
4863.76s: it's a 10 minute video or so that directly compares buying versus selling across all different
4870.00s: parameters that we're going to talk about some now. But let's start here. One is not better than the
4879.68s: other. There's a reason why that is such an important point. One is not better than the other.
4888.08s: The reason why one is not better than the other is because if that were the case,
4893.04s: it's time for the dude to grab his dinner. Give me one sec. Let me pop the door.
4915.04s: It's funny because he knows as soon as I pop that door that it's like his dinner time,
4918.24s: he gets out of here like a bad out of hell. So if one was better than the other,
4924.64s: why would anybody do the other? This is a really, really, really common misconception. And it's a
4933.12s: common misconception that I notice definitely impacts sellers because sellers have this total
4940.16s: misunderstanding that they think what they do is superior to buying. And it's not. It's not
4947.68s: worse than buying. It's just different. It's just different than buying. That's the way to think
4952.24s: about it. Lauren says that's why so many strategies include both. That's not the reason here.
4959.20s: The reason why so many strategies include both is because for smaller accounts,
4965.76s: you have to make a series of concessions that inherently suck. That's the reality of it.
4973.12s: So for a small account, you are automatically going to be backed into having to make small adjustments
4981.28s: and include elements of a trade because you can't afford to buy something outright or you can
4986.88s: afford to sell something outright. Now there are absolutely instances where it still makes sense
4994.40s: to blend both of them together. And it's because each of them has different behavioral inputs
5001.36s: in terms of how the trade will move. So it's less so that just because one is not better than
5007.52s: the other do them both and make it better, it's more because of those two reasons. Smaller accounts
5012.40s: have to make concessions, trading things like verticals, horizontal spreads, stuff like that are
5017.12s: cheaper and they're more accessible. The second thing is for more developed accounts, even though
5021.44s: you're not necessarily worried about use of sizing and whatnot in terms of how much money,
5027.20s: it allows you to take advantage of the built-in components of buying versus selling and the benefits
5034.96s: thereof, which is exactly what we're going to talk about when we get down here. Lauren says,
5040.80s: hedging. Yeah, so you can buy or sell to hedge technically depending on how much you want to hedge,
5047.76s: but that's another big reason why people will trade verticals is because it has a hedge baked in
5053.60s: technically speaking. Cool. So let's take a look at the other, which is overweighting volatility.
5063.28s: I say this because of tasty trade nation and you guys know I really like Tom Saznoff. I love
5071.20s: that dude. I have him on the podcast every couple months. I have a lot of respect for what he does.
5076.08s: So this is in no way talking shit about him or what they do. But if you get into the habit
5083.28s: of every single time bar none, you see volatility is high and you automatically default to selling
5092.16s: just because volatility is high, you're making a mistake. You're making an objective mistake for
5097.28s: a few reasons. One of them is depending on the ticker that you're trading, some of the most
5102.24s: lucrative times to sell premium is when volatility is actually low. Weird, right? Probably
5108.80s: haven't heard that. It's an absolute, absolute fact. The second thing is let's take a look at an example.
5120.16s: Let me close this thing for now. And what's the volume here? 79%.
5128.80s: Implied volatility percentile 81%. I think most people would objectively say that's pretty high
5135.04s: volatility, especially implied volatility percentile metric, correct?
5142.16s: We would say that that's generally high-vol. So with generally high-vol, again, let's get back
5152.64s: to basics. What does high-vol tell us? It tells us something very specific. What is it?
5164.40s: What does high volatility tell us? Any guesses?
5179.12s: And while you're thinking about that, Riz says expectations for future volatility good,
5184.56s: so expand on that a little bit more. There you go. We'll stretch those right on target.
5190.56s: But breaking the wall right on target. Good. Nathan Burke right on target. When we see volatility high,
5198.64s: it means we expect larger movements. Okay. So then let's say let's go back here.
5211.12s: Volatility was also high here in SoFi. Let's go back. I'm going to use on-demand. We're going to go
5216.24s: back in time and look at an example together. We're going to go back to 8 November. Let's do that.
5227.84s: 8 November.
5237.44s: While this is loading, I want to talk about a couple other things. A lot of times there's a
5242.40s: relationship between volatility and price movement, but it's not direct. What that means is a lot
5248.08s: of times when you see a stock going up heavily, volatility will contract. And as the stock starts
5254.64s: plummeting, volatility will expand massively. But it's not always. You can have things that are going
5260.72s: up that are still highly volatile. So let's take a look at an example here. Let's pretend the
5268.32s: date is not here because it's on demand. Let's pretend that the implied volatility percentile
5273.44s: on the 8th of November right now is the same as what we just looked at. Right. So like 82%. Let's just
5281.68s: pretend. Would that mean we would want to buy or sell if we were defaulting based off of the
5289.84s: volatility level itself? And if we were making the mistake of overweighting the volatility input,
5305.84s: we would be primed to sell. The taste is right on it. That's exactly correct. Again,
5312.24s: we're generally taught if implied volatility percentile, if implied volatility rank, if implied
5317.36s: volatility is high, we sell. One of the reason why we're primed to say that or we're primed to learn
5326.40s: that is for this reason here. And again, this is probably easier to understand drawn out.
5335.04s: Like this. So let's say you have an option. And let's say that this is the band.
5341.92s: Let's say that this is 0% vol. This is 100% vol. And in this case, when I say 100%, I simply mean as high as
5355.44s: it can go for the underlying, not actually 100%. So this, let me actually make this easier. So it's clear.
5362.40s: So this will be the lowest. This will be the highest.
5371.76s: So so far, just using today's metrics, I already forgot what they were, but I remember that it was at
5377.12s: 82% percentile. So 82% represents maybe about here. So there's still a little more room that it
5388.64s: can go to the upside before it conceivably gets near wherever its highest point is. One important
5395.52s: admin note is that there's not a cap. It can go. It can go as high as it wants, right? Volatility can
5402.08s: be 1000. It can be 10. It can be one. It can be zero. Volatility can run all of this and it can be
5409.36s: 15 hot, right? There's not a cap. There's not a natural ceiling to it. So what this is telling us,
5417.84s: if you remember from the beginning, we spent a lot of time talking about one of the very important
5423.60s: aspects of volatility from the beginning of this. Do you remember what it was? We talked about it
5430.16s: for a hot minute, but there's a very specific element to this that you have to be aware of. And
5437.12s: while you guys are telling me that, give me one second. I got to go check on the dog because my wife
5443.04s: had a pop out. I will be or be give me one second. Put you guys over on this one.
5474.00s: All right. Hi, A to sober. Nothing. Do you guys not remember the beginning of the the episode?
5493.44s: There is a very specific thing we are talking about with respect to volatility. One of the most
5499.20s: important traits of volatility and why we care about it so much. You guys have to know this.
5507.76s: We compared VIX to SPX. And we talked about one of the key differences between VIX and SPX. We saw
5517.12s: that SPX exhibited something called positive drift. We noticed that VIX, which is literally the
5524.08s: volatility of SPX exhibited mean reversion. Lauren's on it. Mean reversion, also known as the snap.
5537.52s: The reason why all this matters and the reason why you're taught to sell when IV is high is because
5543.68s: the expectation is mean reversion. The expectation is that this vol will be more compelled to contract
5552.56s: down to whatever the mean is. So this is why you are taught to sell volatility when volatility is high.
5565.76s: There's a problem here. Big problem. The big, big problem here is this oversimplifies a really important
5576.64s: function. What this does is it over emphasizes the impact of volatility as compared to the impact
5589.92s: of delta. Take a pause there. I want to make sure that that point is clear.
5596.88s: When we see this, it means we're prioritizing mentally, the movement of volatility. We are
5610.88s: de-sensitizing the prioritization of delta. Unless you are truly isolating delta, it can overwhelm
5624.56s: this volatility input. And I'll show you exactly what that looks like. I got to let it for.
5637.28s: So we're being a straight diva. So let's take a look. We'll clear this off.
5644.48s: Let's use this as an example. You are taught here to sell premium. The other thing that you're
5654.48s: technically taught for a lot of people if you go with the TastyTrade approach, which is to trade
5663.20s: mean reversion and price extensions. So from a TastyTrade perspective, we might look at something
5670.00s: like this and say, well, this is like really overextended to the upside. Valtility is super high.
5674.96s: Let me come in and sell a call, something like this. And somebody else might say, well, I'm actually
5681.84s: expecting this to continue in this direction. I think it looks really good here. I'm going to trade
5688.80s: at bullish and I'm going to sell a put. Let me see if I can enter these as single trades. The
5694.80s: reason why I want to do this is so that you can see how each one of these will behave. Yeah,
5698.72s: let me clear all this nonsense out. Perfect. We have this one. We have the person that sold a put.
5711.68s: I'm giving you three scenarios. And then we have somebody else, the enterprising trader,
5717.44s: who is more interested in isolating profit mechanisms that instead says, you know what,
5722.08s: I'm actually going to buy a call instead of these other ones. And now this, I, one of these I have
5728.56s: to move us back in time. I think maybe this one, which is November 8th. So you guys can see what
5742.64s: this there goes. So first person says, price is extended to the upside. I favor it to the
5752.00s: downside. Volatility is high. I'm going to sell a call. Second person says, I like it to the upside.
5757.76s: I don't want to trade against the trend, but I'm going to sell premium because volatility is high.
5763.84s: Third person says, I think it's going to go up more. And I don't care that volatility is high.
5770.32s: I think the price movement is going to be bigger than any change in volatility. The price movement
5776.96s: is represented by delta. So if we take a look at the options chain quickly, you can see that Vega
5783.92s: here, which we know Vega is the rate of change premium relative to changes in implied volatility.
5792.56s: Vega is 0.02. So every one point move involved will change this by 0.02. Whereas delta for every
5802.32s: one point move in the underlying is going to change it by 64 cents. So what that tells us in order
5809.92s: for this move to overwhelm the delta component of this trade, you literally can do the math.
5818.00s: You need this essentially, you need volatile change by 32%. In order for that volatility to overwhelm
5826.48s: a one point move in the underlying. So somebody knows that and they're playing the directional move
5834.64s: instead. Okay, so let's just fast forward this quickly and we'll go straight to expiration,
5840.08s: which is in this example 20 days. We'll go here.
5845.20s: And let's see how this does.
5851.44s: Thorne.
5854.08s: Like digging through his bed. He is on a whole crackhead vibe right now.
5860.32s: Okay, let's see what this gives us.
5865.28s: Sick. So let's start with the short call. The short call got ran over. The short call stepped
5872.72s: in front of something they thought that they knew better than what market price was.
5876.96s: Something was overextended and they just decided to step in front of the trend and they got
5881.44s: ran over to the upside. Fun fact, this is what happens in the majority of those instances.
5887.12s: Just keeping it a buck. You can be a good price mean reversion trader. It is a thing,
5892.24s: but it is so much more complex than simply saying this thing's gone up a lot. I think it should
5898.32s: go down now. That ain't it. If that's the thesis, that's not a good thesis. Okay, so the short call
5906.96s: ran over crushed. Second one, we have the short put. The short put we originally sold it for 56 cents
5916.08s: and as of today in here, it should be what put did we have? The 12 put.
5925.84s: The 12 put is, I mean, technically trading a liquid. Let's just say that it's trading at zero.
5933.84s: It should be about zero, meaning this would be a full profit. This short put would be a full
5940.96s: profit of 56 cents or 56 dollars. Let's take a look at the long call. The long call as of today
5949.12s: is up $223. What does all of this tell you? This tells you that if you're making the trade decision
5961.76s: based solely on volatility, you make two wrong decisions, possibly. The first decision is if you're
5971.52s: a contrarian trader trying to trade a downside move and you default to that, you just stepped in
5976.00s: in front of a moving trade and just lost in terms of direction. The volatility did not help you.
5980.56s: Your Vega, the volatility contracting as this thing made its up move did not help you. You were
5985.52s: overrun by Delta. It ran you over. This one, best case scenario, you made Max profit. That's awesome.
5994.96s: But you traded something that was defined profit potential on something that maybe you thought it
6002.96s: was going to move a lot. If you think something's going to move a lot, why would we define our profit?
6011.44s: That doesn't make a lot of sense. Then there's the third scenario, the long call, the call that you bought,
6019.68s: even though volatility was high and you're told if volatility was high, you're supposed to default to
6025.12s: sell. Even though you did not do that, you made more money than both of these other scenarios.
6033.68s: This is precisely why we do not overweight volatility and we don't just automatically default to
6042.80s: one or the other. So now let's talk about when to buy when to sell.
6051.12s: The first factor in deciding when we want to buy an option is what fits the portfolio.
6059.28s: That's the first thing. The reason why portfolio fit matters is because that ultimately is the
6067.44s: governing decision of what needs to go on. So you all know in terms of my approach to trading
6073.60s: and portfolio management, it always starts at the portfolio. So what I mean by this is if I have a
6079.36s: portfolio that's full of short premium strategies, meaning defined profit undefined risk.
6087.92s: I might start trying to look for some long premium strategies to try to offset some of that
6095.76s: convexity that is against me in that scenario as compared to being in my favor.
6102.64s: That's why we started the portfolio. That's the first factor. The second is your risk
6109.36s: preference, meaning the downside risk, meaning downside the loss risk, I should say. It's not
6116.48s: relegated to stock going down. This risk preference is your loss management preference.
6125.20s: It's what are we comfortable with taking in terms of risk in the trade. So what that means going
6132.72s: back to this example. The difference, let's just get rid of the short call because it's a completely
6139.60s: different thesis. If I'm comparing this short put against the long call, the difference is on the
6146.96s: short put, I have undefined risk and defined profit. If I'm uncomfortable with this undefined risk,
6154.24s: because maybe as I'm looking at so far, I think maybe it can go up a lot or down a lot. And I'm
6160.08s: just not sure which one I have a slight favor to the upside, but it's not it's slight. It's not a
6166.40s: ton. So I don't want to step in front of this to the downside in case I'm wrong, because then I
6172.16s: can have something where I stand to make $56, but let's say it drops to nine and I lose $282.
6179.68s: That's not a great risk reward profile. That's the risk preference. So then there's this risk
6188.16s: preference where we can say, okay, my max risk at the time of entering this trade is 117.
6194.80s: I'm okay with that because that means if it moves a lot of my favor, I make more than the other
6199.20s: scenario. And if it moves a lot against me, I make a lot in this scenario. I lose less in this
6206.24s: scenario, slightly more optimal. Joseph's straddle or strangle, that's if you don't have a directional
6214.16s: preference. And the straddle or strangle won't make as much money if it does, in fact, move in the
6221.12s: direction that you might think it does. So the way to think about using a long straddle or strangle
6227.36s: is if you just expect movement, but you really don't have a sense of which way it's going to go.
6231.84s: In this case, we were talking about trading a breakout strategy, trading breaks break out to the
6236.16s: upside means we have a directional preference, but we just don't want to get ran over if it goes
6240.64s: against us. So that's the risk preference. The third profit mechanism. This goes back to the
6249.12s: prior example that I just gave you. If we have something, we got in here on this day.
6264.96s: We got in here. Here, I think I was here. We got in here. We're here, whatever, one of these do.
6276.56s: While it's doing this, if my profit mechanism
6288.16s: is a bullish price movement,
6292.00s: break out, which is the subtype, I know based on my trading approach, break out's
6314.64s: carry more severity, which means bigger moves, higher severity.
6325.60s: So if I'm trading this profit mechanism, if I come across so far, I think it's about to
6332.80s: break out for whatever reason based on my analysis, based on my approach, and it looks like it'll
6337.92s: have a breakout, which again, typically means it has bigger moves. Do I want to sell a put
6346.32s: or do I want to buy a call? Which fits this better? Selling a put or buying a call,
6357.52s: based on the scenario that I just laid out for you, what takes best advantage of this profit
6365.20s: mechanism? It's very clearly one of these. This is a primary differentiator between the way that I
6375.60s: think about markets compared to what I see a lot of other people think about markets. And I don't
6380.08s: actually know why. I think it's because of trying to oversimplify things a little bit. The problem
6385.36s: is if you oversimplify things too much, it kind of sucks. And it kind of sucks because it sabotages
6392.80s: the nuance, which is where a lot of the potential is. Because in this scenario, both of these would
6399.28s: have won. Both of these made money. But the difference is this made way more money four times
6408.56s: the amount of money than this one did. So what ends up happening is you have people that defaults
6415.52s: to selling options because it's a higher probability trade. They like the idea of winning frequently.
6422.00s: But then this might not make any sense based on the profit mechanism. So that goes back to this point.
6436.64s: When we're making the decision on buying versus selling, one of the factors portfolio fit. Second
6445.52s: factor risk preference of the difference between buying and selling premium, which you're aware of
6450.56s: now. The third factor is what is the profit mechanism and what makes more sense for that profit
6459.84s: mechanism? The fourth factor is now ancillary overlays as I refer to it as this is where we get into
6469.52s: the fine tuning details of things like do I have an opinion on being short theta long gamma? Do I
6478.48s: have an opinion on that for this specific trade? If nothing here stacked up in my favor,
6484.80s: or if nothing here naturally diverted me into buying versus selling. Ancillary overlays is if I get
6492.00s: through all of this agnostic to buying or selling risk preference, don't care buying or selling.
6496.56s: Profit mechanism is price direction up, but it's not really I'm not expecting a whole lot of
6502.88s: movement, although it could be. So we're still at the point where buying or selling can make sense.
6509.28s: Now, now it might make sense to say what's implied volatility percentile at. Does that make sense
6517.60s: for this position? Matea says I prefer sold the put and Joe says I prefer selling puts as well.
6526.88s: And that's okay. People will have preferences. The problem with preferences like that is they're
6531.92s: objectively suboptimal. So you have to accept that. But that's okay. You can trade suboptimally.
6541.04s: You don't have to overfit and have things as optimized as possible. What I can tell you is it's
6547.92s: better to have things as optimized as possible. It's how I've been trading like I said, I just wrapped
6553.44s: up my 18th year of trading. It's how I've been doing this for so long. So there's nothing wrong.
6559.68s: If you choose and you're like, I'd rather just sell the put versus buying the call. I prefer it
6564.96s: for these X, Y and Z reasons. The problem is is that we have an arbitrary preference based on
6572.48s: not logic at that point. It's based on an underlying assumption. Matea says you don't know if the
6579.52s: call is going to have profits. You don't know if the put is either. If that tells me that there's
6584.72s: a breakdown in the strategy, that's not the problem with buying versus selling. If you buy a call
6589.92s: or sell a put, you don't know if that put's going to have profit either. It can go against you. You
6593.12s: can be directionally wrong. The point is if you buy a call and you're directionally correct in this
6598.00s: scenario, you simply make more money. It's based on your strategy. That's not a fault with buying
6602.88s: versus selling. And this goes back to the broader point because in this case for the people that say,
6608.72s: well, I prefer to sell the put again. That's cool. But the reality is if you sold a put in that
6613.60s: scenario, you made 56 bucks. The person that bought the call and that scenario made literally
6618.56s: four times the money. So what that leads to long term is significant outperformance. This is why
6626.16s: people who like getting into selling and start defaulting to selling, which is way, way more common
6632.16s: than people defaulting into buying beyond just being more comfortable with the concept of buying.
6637.44s: But sellers are notorious for that. It's because it becomes a comfort zone. It becomes
6642.32s: comfortable because it's a higher probability trade. And it's okay. You can be comfortable.
6646.72s: But there's a cost for comfort. You're not going to make as much money. That's just how it's
6652.80s: going to go. And that's okay. For some people that might be slightly more preferential. And that's
6660.08s: totally cool. It really is totally cool. It's up to the individual trader to figure it out. But
6665.44s: as I always try to remind traders, what's most important in my opinion is going into things
6672.40s: eyes wide open, objectively saying, I prefer selling puts. I know it's suboptimal. It's suboptimal
6680.08s: for this reason, this reason, this reason, these reason. But I still prefer it for these reasons.
6685.28s: And I'm okay with that trade off. That's cool. That is completely cool. But what a lot of people do
6690.88s: is they shy away from that because they get uncomfortable. And they don't want to look at the
6696.08s: suboptimal components of what they're doing because then we're acknowledging that what we're doing
6700.48s: like truly isn't fully logical. And that can be difficult for people to swallow.
6706.64s: But yeah, I have absolutely no issue with people that have a general preference one way or the
6713.68s: other. The again, the downside to it is you're going to see it in your performance. And you could
6718.08s: be okay with that. But for somebody like me, it's not okay. Like my job is to trade as effectively
6726.72s: as I can, given my sets of parameters, to make as much money as I possibly can. And it's how I
6732.80s: made so much money through trading before I was 30 is by optimizing in this way. So just food for
6740.00s: thought. Okay. So that wraps us up for the session today. Now I have some homework for you guys.
6750.16s: One of the things I'm going to give you and then we'll get into open Q&A. I'm not done yet.
6754.80s: But I just want to give you your homework in case you do have to bounce because I know we've been
6758.96s: on for a little while, which is here. Let me find it. Here.
6770.96s: So this is your homework. The takeaway for today is to go and select four stocks. Actually,
6794.48s: you could do two stocks. You don't even need four. Select two stocks. And you want one that you're
6801.12s: bullish in and you want one that's your bearish in. Then in both of those stocks, based on aligning
6812.72s: with your disposition, create a long premium strategy and a short premium strategy. And just
6819.68s: compare. See how they go. So the way that this would work, just to summarize, actually, I realize
6826.72s: I need to add the timestamp here for homework. 53. Just call it one, 53. This will be episode two homework.
6837.68s: So what you'll do is you'll say stock XYZ. I'm bullish. The profit mechanism, if you're following
6845.68s: the outlier strategy process, we codify what the profit mechanism is. If you're unfamiliar with
6851.36s: what the outlier strategy or outlier trade processes, I have two videos. It's completely free.
6856.16s: There's nothing attached to it. It's just to give you a framework on how to think about these
6861.36s: things a little more effectively. Because there, I mean, it's their frameworks that I built for myself
6867.12s: for that exact reason. So those are the two. So I threw them in the chat there and then I'll also
6874.96s: throw it in the video notes so that you have that. Let me grab this one really quick.
6885.92s: Okay. So profit mechanism here is going to be price direction up.
6892.80s: The subtype is whatever the subtype is. It can be drift and be breakout. It can be a catalyst.
6903.60s: Whatever it is. And then based on that, I'm going to structure two different trades
6913.20s: in the same underline. So I know I'm going to trade two. I'm going to put on two bullish trades
6917.52s: in here. So this one I might sell a put and this one I might buy a call. So this is the first one.
6927.12s: Then you do it for another stock that you're bearish in. So stock ABC, we're bearish.
6937.60s: You go through the same process and then here maybe we sell a call and then buy a put.
6947.28s: Like that. So that's the homework. And for those that are in the discord, which again,
6955.52s: it's completely free to join. You can throw it in the channel. I've built a thread
6962.96s: for the learning lab. I'll share a link here, which is a thread for essentially collating stuff
6976.08s: around this. Okay.
6994.48s: So the link to that is here. My thought was here. How do I share this link?
7003.04s: Copy link. Here you go. It's here. And then for those that are not in there and you don't
7011.44s: want to join total equal, you can throw it as comments to the video. One of the things,
7016.64s: the reason I'm asking you to do this is because the process of seeing what other people do will
7021.68s: help you generate some ideas. And that I think is worth your time. So that's why that is your homework.
7030.72s: Okay. So now is literally the perfect time. If you have ancillary questions, things that we
7036.72s: didn't hit throughout the episode, now is the perfect time. And it doesn't have to be specific
7042.08s: to the episode. If there's just random stuff you saw this week in the options markets that you're
7046.72s: curious about. If there's a burning options question that you've had for some time. If there's
7050.72s: a concept you're unclear on, if there's a step in your process and you're like, I don't know where
7056.48s: to go now. This is the perfect time for all that stuff. And while you guys are doing that,
7061.36s: I'm going to start going through and figure out what the dinner plan is going to be because I don't
7067.60s: really know this work. That was actually easier than I thought. And then I'll pop up and see
7081.20s: what you guys are thinking. Good, good, good. That's all good.
7093.36s: And that's good. Cool. All right. What questions you guys have?
7099.68s: Anything from here sticking out. And then in the meantime, a quick preview of the next one
7107.36s: is going to be looking at option pricing. So we want to get more close to things like early assignment
7117.68s: thinking through when we might choose to close trades. That kind of stuff. Let's talk about early.
7125.92s: Well, let's do exercise.
7130.48s: Assignment.
7133.44s: Process and risks.
7136.80s: And then the other note is if there are specific options trading topics that we want to hit,
7146.16s: we still have a handful of flex sessions that we can build out. So just keep that in mind.
7152.32s: All right. Let's get into some Q and A and see where we at. I will probably keep this up because
7159.68s: there's a good chance I'm a draw. I bet.
7167.52s: And Reese says toss head and video IV are at zero, which may be tempted to buy options.
7175.28s: Is that miss miss guided all selling premium because IV? Yep, that's correct. That's miss guided.
7184.32s: The reason why it's miss guided is based on that alone, there are two things to keep in mind.
7191.92s: And let's again, let's take it back to basics.
7202.72s: If I buy to open, we know I need movement.
7208.00s: If ball.
7216.24s: Well, in this case, IV are equals zero. That equals very low ball, which equals very low movement.
7233.52s: Very low movement.
7244.48s: Does not equal need movement.
7247.44s: So while you might say I'm going to buy to open a straddle,
7260.96s: because I think
7265.36s: Vol will go up. This is still a secondary profit mechanism.
7281.92s: Primary is still delta.
7285.44s: So the way that I would look at that specific trade, Reese, is let's say that I was bullish
7295.36s: in Nvidia or bearish whichever. I have a directional preference in Nvidia.
7300.72s: And then let's say I look at the portfolio.
7302.72s: Portfolio doesn't need anything specific. It doesn't matter. I look at the different risk profile
7306.80s: between those. I'm indifferent. It doesn't matter. So now I'm at the point of structuring the trade.
7312.24s: Then I might say, okay, I'm slightly bullish in this idea.
7316.88s: And I don't really know how much it's going to move. I don't necessarily think this is going to be
7321.44s: a moonshot. So then what I do is super, super simple. We come out of on demand.
7331.04s: We go into Nvidia.
7334.72s: And then we say, let me just clear this out.
7342.56s: We can close one of these programs down.
7345.04s: And then I say, where do I think it's going to go?
7347.28s: I think it's going to go up. I think it's going to go up by how much.
7351.04s: So let's say my profit target is going to be 150 in the next couple of weeks.
7355.36s: So then I say, how do I compare these?
7358.16s: I say, well, I have a bullish tilt. I've used super low. Let me take a look at selling this put.
7368.40s: Let me compare that selling that put against to buying this call.
7374.72s: Maybe we go further out on the call. Something like this.
7379.76s: And my preference, my price target here is going to be a dollar 50. I'm sorry, 150.
7386.56s: That's the initial price target, 150. So all I do is I say, what do I make at 150 here?
7391.52s: I make $102 on this one. What do I make here? A thousand sixteen.
7396.16s: So let me say, well, you're going to put up more money on this one because you have to buy
7400.56s: 1485, $1485. So what's the margin requirement for this one?
7405.84s: 13,000. It's already the same, right? Because this is a pass through IRA account.
7410.40s: So it's requiring it to be cash secured on a regulation T margin account.
7414.64s: You might be able to get two or three. I have portfolio margins. So I'm actually not sure
7418.48s: what the margin requirement would be and how many you could put on.
7421.44s: But let's just say you could put on a multiple of whatever it is.
7425.52s: So let's say you put on five. Well, if I put on five and I get that move to 150,
7430.72s: I make five 14. If I buy this one and I get that move to 150, I make 1016.
7439.44s: Right. So you see what I'm you see what I'm highlighting is that the profit mechanism here is
7444.88s: still direction. Now, if I look at these and the difference is negligible based on my price target,
7451.52s: let's say I don't think it's going to go up that high. Let's say looking at this price
7456.16s: and all this stuff, I think it might go to 141 and we analyze the difference instead at 141,
7462.56s: it will be much tighter. So 141, we make 405 here, 141 on the put why
7476.96s: why is that showing it losing money?
7482.48s: I'm confused. Oh, is that because it's lower than I know? It's not.
7494.96s: For the dates messed up.
7499.28s: There it is. The thing down here was using old dates. That's why I was so confused.
7506.48s: So if I sold five of these and it goes to 141, I make 415. If I buy one of these, I make 195.
7517.44s: So now it's actually stacking in favor of selling. And then I also have the secondary benefit
7523.76s: of expecting maybe some sort of expansion involved. But I don't care. Like the selling perspective
7531.36s: still makes more money here. So the dominant feature is still direction. That's the take away there.
7541.52s: Cool. Let me know if that makes sense for you. Next is from Peter, when you sell a put versus
7550.56s: buying a call for a bullish thesis, doesn't selling the put have a higher probability of making money
7556.00s: depending on the delta you choose? Yep. It does. And you can calculate all of that stuff
7562.16s: depending on how you intend to manage it. That's an important element because let's use the same
7568.08s: example that we're looking at now. And I'm just going to reduce it to, we'll keep it out of five
7572.48s: lot. And let's say that I'm going to manage this trade, meaning if it goes to different prices,
7583.04s: I'm going to exit. So let's say that I'm going to exit. If it goes below this handle, the 128,
7592.48s: let's say it goes to 128. And that's where I would exit. Well, if I go in here and I take a look
7598.08s: at 128, let's say that I'm going to have this trade on for two weeks. And I take a look at the
7604.96s: probability of touching 128. The probability of touching 128 is 30% chance. So what I'm showing
7613.04s: you is that that higher probability will help you. But if you're going to manage it based on different
7620.00s: touches like this in terms of a directional trading approach, that that benefit actually decreases
7626.72s: a little bit, not a ton, but it decreases a little bit. So what that ends up meaning for you is
7632.56s: then we can analyze at the 128 loss handle, which one of these looks better based on how much you
7640.24s: can make. And then you can literally conduct it. You can literally conduct an expected return
7645.92s: calculation. So if we take a look at the 128, let's say that we think it's going to go between 141
7653.76s: and 128. Those are our two targets. And let's go into the scratch here so that is there not
7660.64s: an expected return in here that's annoying? Give me one sec. I'm just going to drop an expected
7666.72s: return calculation in here. And then I'll get rid of whatever all this nonsense is.
7677.76s: And let's do this one.
7696.96s: Now, let's take a peek.
7712.48s: Our target is going to be the 142 for the profit. Our loss is going to be 128. This will be
7721.44s: for the long call. This will be for the short puts. So we already know, we already did some of the
7730.56s: math here. And we already know that the probability of hitting the 128 was what, like 30% or 28%
7740.48s: I already forgot because you know, the memory of a goldfish, 28.5%.
7758.16s: And then the probability of us hitting 142 in that same time frame.
7761.44s: 64.4%. This is based on our managed targets, 64.4. Meaning once it hits these levels, we would do
7775.60s: something. And depending on what it is that we would do. So now, let's take a look at the PNL
7784.40s: levels. So the long call at 142 and 128. Let me wish this down so that we can look at this stuff
7795.76s: at the same time.
7808.08s: And then we'll go to the risk profile. So now, all we do,
7812.32s: we're on the short puts. So we'll start with that at 142. We make 555 up to 1650.
7825.92s: So we'll put 555 to start. And then we have to add another column specifically
7832.88s: for the short puts because it's going to change the time frame.
7836.40s: So this will be short puts managed and then there will be short puts,
7841.84s: X-Berry. And then at X-Berry, that would be 1650.
7847.20s: Now, we need to also do the loss side at expiration, which would be for those short puts 21FAB.
7871.04s: So we'll use that here. The reason why it's important to do that is because you'll see that it
7875.20s: actually opens up the expected moves quite a lot. So then there will be two series of
7882.40s: probabilities that we're going to be talking about. There will be at expiration and then prior to
7887.60s: expiration. And we'll do this for both. So this will be probability at a management point.
7894.96s: And then this will be probability at expiration. This will be at a management point.
7904.96s: And then this will be the long call, same thing. And this is literally something you all can do
7911.92s: for yourselves to understand how this stuff works and to get more comfortable with the behavior of
7917.92s: these. So right now, we're starting with the management point. Let's just finish the management
7926.00s: point through for all of them. And the management point, I'm using a perspective two week time frame
7931.12s: for something like that. So then the 128s or at 128, this would make lose 2064. 2064.
7948.48s: And now let's take a look at the long calls quickly.
7960.40s: At the profit target of 142,
7965.84s: our long call itself would make 195.
7971.04s: And then at 128, it loses 530. So these are, it's not a totally fair comparison because you could
7982.48s: tell by these numbers, we're using a different overall size and scope, right? Because I didn't
7987.28s: actually do the math to see for regulation T how many calls I could put on, but it doesn't matter.
7993.60s: You'll still see the the important output here. So now let's take a look,
7998.80s: update the probabilities based on at expiration. So the probability
8008.56s: of hitting 142 and being there at expiration, we have to update this.
8016.72s: So expiration for the short, let's just 21 Feb here. And the probability of 142
8029.60s: is 37. Realistically, the top side doesn't matter that much actually is we're looking at this.
8036.24s: For the short put, what matters is our strike, which is the 131. So what's the probability 21 Feb
8043.04s: of being above 131? 66.6. 66.6% chance. And then
8058.16s: the probability of being below that less the credit, which is 131 minus 3. So let's just call
8068.48s: it 127.5. Dame expiration, 127.5, below that 25% chance.
8088.72s: And then our risk at that level at expiration would be 2064. So I have to move this number
8098.16s: over. And then at 128 before that would be 1840. And then I'll summarize all this for you so
8113.44s: that you kind of know what the fuck is going on. So then the short puts at 142 before
8124.48s: will be 583. That's good. Okay. So now let's take a look at the long calls really quick.
8132.32s: Long call at 142 will be like 527. And then at 128,
8142.32s: I'm an idiot at 142 will be 266. And then 128 would be 522.
8165.12s: Negative. And then this is negative. And then this is.
8185.76s: Now what I've just made is an entire matrix that we can objectively analyze this.
8194.16s: Now one thing to keep in mind is you don't have to do after each trade that you do or you'll
8199.60s: get a sense of what these numbers are going to be. So that's the benefit. You'll develop a
8204.24s: little bit of intuition here. But what we can do is we can figure out the expected return
8208.80s: for both of these scenarios. So we can do expected return for a managed position and we can do
8215.44s: expected return at X-PRI. And then we can compare these.
8225.52s: expected return. We'll just do it actually down here.
8246.40s: So this will equal this.
8257.36s: Well, hold on. You guys know how to do this. What? Yeah, I just realized I'm about to start building
8261.28s: this whole thing out for you. But you guys know how to do this, right? So if we take a look and
8267.36s: compare the two different strategies, we would have an expected return for the long call.
8273.28s: And we would have an expected return. So this should be expected return for managed. This will
8282.08s: be expected return for managed. And there will be two different expected returns. There will be one
8289.12s: for the long call. And then there will be one for the short puts. And then you literally make
8295.04s: the decision based on this. So then there will be an expected return at expiration for the long
8301.28s: call and expected return at expiration for the short puts. And then you compare these.
8309.84s: And now you can make an actual decision. And I think you guys already know how to do this. I'll show
8316.88s: you just hold on. I think you guys will just do the first one. And then I'll have you guys do the
8329.04s: other ones. So let's do the expected return for the long call. The expected return for the long
8333.20s: call is the wind probability or the wind size times the wind probability. And in this case, we have
8340.00s: to do plus because this is negative number plus the loss times the loss probability.
8348.08s: And then for the short put, the wind size times the wind probability plus the loss times the loss
8363.52s: probability. And you can see from this perspective, which one looks good out of the gate. And then you
8373.04s: could do the same thing. This is looking at a managed position. This is looking at expiration.
8403.52s: And then you can literally make the comparison, which one of these fits better.
8407.84s: So you guys can fill out this other side because you guys can obviously follow along with what I
8412.80s: did. And when you have the answer to this side, again, either throw it as a comment, throw it in
8416.96s: the chat or throw it in the discord. And let me get through the rest of these. And then your boy
8423.68s: is going to wrap up. Alberto said, okay, so you guys already answered that. M54 says, how often do
8434.64s: options traders exercise their contracts or is it mostly trading the contract? The overwhelming
8438.96s: majority has traded. It's like over 70%. Exercise is a subset of that. I want to say it's like 15 or
8446.40s: 18% or maybe the low 20s, but it's a minority of instant. The day says, what would be a good
8453.20s: strategy for you that combines both selling and buying? For me, it would be ratio diagonals.
8462.24s: That is a way that I combine both buying and selling. But the reason why I combine both buying
8470.16s: and selling in that context is to take advantage of the risk profile of buying and selling
8479.44s: specifically, which is a little bit different than the sake of buying and selling, again, just for
8487.92s: like the sake of reducing risk or something like that. For me, when I'm including both buying
8494.40s: and selling components of a trade, it's for a very, very specific risk profile. It's not because
8499.60s: I'm trying to like reduce risk. The thing is, is traders get obsessed with reducing risk with
8504.56s: their positions and thus in doing so, you inherently reduce your profitability.
8511.60s: Becoming too risk adverse literally becomes a disease. It becomes a really, really big
8517.92s: thing that we like the feeling of it. It's less scary. But if you condition yourself to trade,
8524.16s: for example, like naked premium strategies and you just size appropriately, you realize that's
8528.88s: actually not that scary. The risk is completely capable of being controlled effectively.
8537.60s: That's the main time that I would be mixing buying and selling or doing buying and selling at the
8541.84s: same time would be via ratio call diagonal. The other example could be something like the
8548.96s: coverage strangle that I run, which is what I consider to be a superior alternative to the wheel.
8554.72s: But that's buying equity and then selling options. So a little bit different.
8560.40s: Capital Apes is do you recommend selling premium on leveraged ETFs? If you want. I have a coverage
8566.56s: strangle on right now and you prone to triple cues. So it can be fine, but you just have to understand
8572.72s: the ticker, like the product in that case that you're trading and be comfortable with it. But
8578.72s: yeah, I mean, it can work. Okay. You just have to have a solid management plan in place for it
8584.96s: because it can also be really, really destructive at the same time if you don't.
8592.56s: Lauren says, this is the part that stresses me out, not because I'm lazy and don't want to do it
8596.56s: because I don't know how. And that's why we're doing this exact thing together here is to show you how.
8603.12s: And this is a really easy way to think about managing risk. And I have a video that talks about
8611.36s: this exact process of how to do this kind of thing. And the main goal here is
8623.04s: to quantify different levels so that we can make an objective decision of virtual numbers.
8628.96s: Mark says for long calls, are we better off targeting strikes in the money or out of the money?
8635.20s: And how far in and out is there a method to madness and picking the strikes? They're absolutely
8638.88s: as there's an entire science box. And you guessed it, I have a video that walks through literally
8647.68s: that entire process in detail on.
8658.00s: Let me see. Where is it?
8667.76s: Here we go.
8673.60s: This one. So, Mark, this video will walk you through that in its entirety. There's a lot to it.
8680.56s: That's why it's not a it's not a small question. I literally think that video I just dropped in.
8684.40s: There was like 20 minutes long. And it's because it goes through the striking a balance between
8689.28s: the various deltas and stuff. The Cliff Notes version is you have to think through what
8694.64s: expiration makes sense. Then within that expiration, the strike selection really is not about the
8701.04s: strikes at all. It's all about delta, gamma and theta. Those are the main inputs in deciding what
8707.20s: you want to buy. So the way I look at it is I don't even care what the strike price is. It literally
8712.32s: is meaningless to me. What matters are the Greeks that I'm trying to pick up for the trade idea.
8718.88s: And that will depend on how much you're expecting the thing to move. If you expect something to move
8724.24s: a lot, then you can make way more money by building what we call units, which is using further
8729.76s: out of the money options that have high gamma. So they're not super far out in time. So that
8734.16s: they'll compound a lot. If you're expecting a medium amount of movement, then that's typically
8741.04s: how I structure them. I'll use options that are at least 60 days to expiration, preferably 90
8747.28s: as at a minimum for the long option component. That's because it decreases the overall theta decay per
8754.24s: day, even though you're paying more money outright. I'm not taking it into expiration.
8758.48s: Then I use a higher delta to start one because it also decreases theta decay, but you will also
8763.84s: get a better dollar for dollar move with the underlying. So if I have a delta that's 80 or 70 or even
8769.36s: 60 as the underlying goes up one dollar, that is going to move by 60 cents. So the underlying gives
8776.16s: you a dollar move that gives you 60 cents. You're collecting a good bit of that. If you have a really
8781.36s: low delta option of 10 delta, if the underlying moves at dollar, you get fucked and just have 10
8787.28s: dollars to show for it, meaning a 10 cent move. So the only time that the out of the money start to
8792.48s: make a lot more sense is if you're expecting a really, really big movement, which for me, a lot of
8797.92s: times I will add them to something like a ratio called diagonal, I call them kicker options.
8804.32s: They add like a little bit of a kicker to the trade if it goes in your favor. But then you still
8808.56s: have the primary base of the trade, which is the in the money options, low worth 80 to K,
8814.00s: but they move better for dollar with the underlying and so. So that's the high level overview of
8821.76s: that like 20 minute video.
8828.24s: Wheat. All right, guys, I am tired. I really enjoy doing these. I try to make sure I'm doing a
8835.04s: good job for you guys. I want to give you really, really good information as best as I possibly can.
8840.08s: The only thing I ask from you all is if you can, please share what we're doing with other people.
8847.60s: The reason why I care about that so much is you can tell there's not even ads that run during
8852.00s: the livestream or anything like I literally make nothing from doing this. But this is like,
8857.20s: this is the pay it forward part of what that mentor did for me. And you'd be clear, he never did
8865.36s: anything like this for me. He doesn't even know how to trade. That's funny. But he's the one that
8869.76s: introduced me to investing. And I feel so indebted because of where and how it's changed the
8878.96s: trajectory of my life. And I know how important this stuff can be for people. So that's the
8886.72s: mean thing that you guys can do to help me with this is literally just to share it with other people
8893.12s: that are trying to figure out how to trade options because there's so much information out there
8899.12s: that's a lot of it is meant in good faith. But it's just not great information, unfortunately.
8906.40s: So my goal is to try and connect people with better information and not all of it's going to be
8912.16s: mine. Like one of the biggest books I recommend is options as a strategic investment, stuff like that.
8917.60s: So yeah, hope the session was useful. Absolutely. Enjoy talking about this stuff. We have a big one
8925.92s: set up for next week. Lauren, the homey just hooked people up, five people without
8932.56s: liar trading memberships. Really it's just a way to support the channel. So super, super
8935.92s: thankful for doing that and hooking some people up. And yeah, if you guys need anything,
8940.64s: you guys can hit me up in the discord in the comments, whatever. Happy to help as best I can.
8945.04s: Be an outlier. I'll see you guys later and enjoy the weekend.
