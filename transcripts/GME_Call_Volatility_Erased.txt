0.72s: I got a DM asking what happened to the
4.00s: volatility in GameStop today and the
7.20s: goal of this video is to walk you
8.52s: through exactly that my hope is to try
10.76s: and help share more details on how we
13.72s: can interpret volatility from the
15.16s: options chain and review it for
18.32s: information and potentially some ideas
20.28s: on where the markets might be pricing
22.00s: and things to move options markets are
24.56s: very smart now another thing is if you
28.40s: haven't seen the video I put out earlier
29.96s: today on how to buy options smarter
33.00s: specifically in something like GameStop
34.84s: you should check that out I will throw
36.28s: it in the description below because
38.88s: volatility is such an important part of
41.24s: trading options and a lot of people got
44.32s: burned today because of that so let's do
47.68s: a quick recap on the 20th of June
49.88s: volatility was up to 247 per. this is
52.96s: very high and as we got closer into the
55.72s: expiration typically you will see
57.92s: volatility can do a bunch of different
60.04s: things but unless there's a perception
62.88s: of a big move that remains there
66.12s: typically you will see the expected move
68.16s: kind of contract volatility kind of
69.80s: contract because as there's less time
72.88s: there's typically a smaller expected
75.28s: range the way to think about that is if
77.44s: you were to guess about the total price
80.20s: range of GameStop over the next day or
83.68s: one 100 days which of those do you think
86.40s: would have a bigger price range 100 days
88.96s: right now what we do with this
90.64s: volatility is we adjust it based on the
93.48s: amount of time that's remaining so
95.76s: that's why you'll see in this instance
98.16s: this volatility is 247 with only an
100.64s: expected move of
102.48s: $22.70 but if we go super far out here
105.48s: this only has a 95% Vol but a 40 Point
108.84s: expected move that's why that is this is
110.84s: adjusted for time so what ended up
113.68s: happening today well this we fell off a
117.20s: cliff when I looked at the expiration
120.88s: volatility for today right before the
122.40s: close it had contracted massively after
125.88s: the close it dropped off so I don't have
128.16s: the figure for you in this screenshot at
130.12s: least but what I do want to look at with
132.08s: you is this actually which
135.76s: is next
137.60s: week's expiration and there's a couple
140.84s: things that I want to highlight here
142.56s: specifically this essentially we've gone
144.92s: from 189 down to
147.56s: 155 big drop really big drop the other
151.04s: thing that I want to highlight that I
152.20s: was talking about yesterday that we've
153.84s: now gone back on again is the rest of
156.96s: the chain has declined
160.16s: precipitously so if you take a look at
162.96s: the volatility that we saw yesterday it
165.88s: went 247 189 163 160 158 155 150 so on
171.96s: and so forth now if we look over here
175.12s: it's at 155 for next week then 139 139
180.28s: 139 the fact that these three are the
183.48s: same is actually very informative to me
187.48s: and it's because this is the first time
189.20s: we've seen the volatility surface here
191.36s: start to flatten out this much it's
194.88s: essentially 139 to 134 and this takes us
199.44s: all the way out essentially 60 days to
201.96s: expiration to the 16 August something
204.24s: like that so there's been a huge huge
208.40s: contraction in volatility so if we pop
210.48s: open the platform let's take a look at
212.64s: how to visualize this what this looks
214.24s: like you can see the volatility for the
217.40s: next couple weeks here I have us out to
219.48s: 28 June 5 July if I tick off this 28
225.08s: June and we look at July so 5 July 12
227.84s: July 19 July 26 July look how close all
230.96s: of those are there's not that much going
234.04s: on here now there are some really
236.88s: interesting inversions that I see that
239.84s: are tradable events for our volatility
242.40s: Traders out there but not diving super
244.64s: far down that rabbit hole let's take a
246.76s: look over the next two weeks what
248.52s: volatility looks like and I've already
250.76s: gone over a lot of detail about what
253.60s: you're looking at here the volatility
255.44s: smile and I want to focus your eyes on
258.64s: the 28th of June 1st next week's
261.24s: expiration the very first thing that I
263.32s: noticed we talk about these out ofth
265.48s: money options right and a lot of you
268.00s: have actually gotten really good at
269.24s: reading this it's very cool people are
271.04s: shooting me messages saying hey I'm
272.72s: seeing this what does this mean and
274.24s: that's it's honestly awesome from an
275.72s: options trading perspective this is a
277.12s: great tool to have so when I look at
279.72s: next week one of the very first things I
281.72s: noticed that's again unique is we see
285.40s: the call side actually have more total
288.60s: Volve for these super far out ofth the-
290.24s: money options than the put side and
292.12s: that's represented right above my head
293.56s: notice how the call side breaks up above
296.16s: this line whereas on the put side I
298.04s: guess I can't show you cuz my arm gets
299.48s: cover off but the put side over there
301.40s: that's essentially at the top of the put
302.92s: side my expectation would be as next
306.28s: week goes this putside will probably
308.76s: grow unless we start to see some sort of
311.08s: big move that warrants the volatility
313.20s: that we're seeing here but that's not a
314.80s: given that's the other thing that I have
318.04s: to highlight for you guys a lot of
319.92s: people were like yo what happened there
323.88s: was a million of these calls all the way
326.64s: out here at the 125 handle let's see if
328.68s: we can find them
330.48s: 32,000 what happened I thought there was
332.68s: this big call Wall here's what's
334.72s: happening here first thing this
337.28s: volatility I mean you can see at the
339.24s: close it was 6
341.52s: 6600 6, 600% IV as you get closer to the
347.04s: close especially on really far out of
349.04s: the money options on something like
350.84s: GameStop that could for whatever reason
353.44s: go parabolic if roaring Kitty puts out
356.36s: something or if Cohen puts out something
359.64s: that gets everybody up and just moving
362.24s: like crazy this poses an insane risk for
367.36s: whoever is making the market in this
369.04s: product to get ran over into a close on
372.44s: expiration that's why for something like
375.08s: this you will see the volatility jacked
376.80s: up so freaking High because I call it a
380.80s: puncher's chance if you kind of like
382.80s: martial arts I'm a martial artist myself
385.24s: there's always a puncher chance you can
387.04s: be against somebody that's grossly
389.56s: skilled compared to you but if they have
392.72s: enough power one shot literally can
396.00s: knock you out it could be the luckiest
397.32s: shot on Earth and it can knock you out
399.24s: it's devastating you lose the fight you
401.00s: could win the entire fight and lose it
402.52s: right at the very end it's kind of the
404.08s: opposite of actually what happened with
405.72s: Holloway and gaii where Holloway won the
408.88s: entire fight and then at the end called
410.96s: him out for a slugfest which was awesome
412.56s: by the way back to this this is a pun's
415.88s: chance the reason why these are priced
417.80s: so expensively is because in the crazy
420.16s: off chance that there was a massive
422.68s: parabolic up move a market maker could
425.16s: get ran over by that order flow so
428.04s: that's why they jack up the implied
430.00s: volatility on these things so much and
432.92s: if we look on the put side it's even
435.56s: higher the putside is
439.32s: 11,900
441.08s: absolutely chaos here if we take a look
443.72s: at Apple again I use this as a
445.04s: comparison just to give you some ideas
446.92s: the put side here is5 ,
451.00s: 206% so this is not novel to just
455.28s: GameStop this on this side is
459.84s: 1,756 what you'll notice though is that
462.88s: the relative volatility between the call
465.32s: and the put side is very different
466.64s: between these two products you can very
468.16s: clearly tell in apple there's definitely
470.48s: more fear for a perspective move to the
472.60s: downside because this is at 15,000
474.60s: compared to 1,700 whereas if we go to
478.24s: GameStop on the put side it's 12,000 is
483.56s: and then on the call side it's
486.08s: essentially half of that right very
488.08s: different than what I just showed you in
489.32s: apple but that that's what that is
491.36s: they're pricing in a punchers chance so
493.92s: this doesn't mean that anybody really
496.00s: thinks that this is going to go to the
497.20s: moon now for all of these buyers it's
499.92s: the same puncher chance they're taking a
501.84s: puncher chance these are insanely cheap
504.60s: options that are going to Decay away
506.24s: essentially to nothing as they did far
508.84s: more often then not this is a lottery
511.72s: and then some this is playing the
513.60s: lottery with the expectation of also
515.40s: getting struck by lightning in the same
517.04s: day that's the kind of probability
518.76s: that's being baked into this move but
520.24s: for some people it is just so cheap to
522.56s: put these on for a penny or two pennies
524.56s: that they don't care because you could
526.60s: put on thousands of those and if you get
528.56s: one that hits all of those thousands can
530.92s: be paid for not a great investment
534.08s: approach in general in my opinion this
535.60s: isn't the way that I personally trade
537.40s: it's a great way to throw money away
538.76s: again check out that video I talked
540.04s: about earlier it talks about this exact
541.84s: thing and trying to structure these
543.76s: options trades a little bit more smart
546.08s: so that we're not just bleeding money
547.92s: last thing let's take a look at it next
549.60s: week and there's not a lot going on in
552.60s: these options chains objectively this is
554.80s: interesting to me this is probably the
556.12s: most interesting thing I see in here
558.00s: where the 30s have 17,500 oi with 14,600
562.92s: transacted today I do want to see if
565.40s: these continue to build out but this is
567.64s: still all just a just
569.92s: small small small spec of what we've
573.00s: been seeing the other thing I want to
574.32s: show you is take a look at kind of the
576.48s: right out of the money call oi as
579.32s: compared to the put side and this at
581.60s: down here probably is another great view
583.28s: for that if we grab the oi and we look
585.44s: at at the out of the monies you can see
588.88s: if we go over here to like 24 and here
592.04s: where the centralization is let me grab
594.68s: next expiration cycle only and we're
598.12s: trading right about 20 four so like
600.04s: right around in here and again you'll
603.08s: notice that most of the depth is
605.76s: definitely out here in the put side in
607.84s: terms of like average size but take a
609.48s: look at this on the call side there are
612.32s: some crazy bastards out there at the 120
616.84s: something actually let's see what those
618.52s: are we have to add more strikes here and
620.88s: again this goes back to what I was just
622.24s: explaining to you guys the punchers
624.16s: chance these are really cheap options
626.52s: all the way up here in nose beds these
628.44s: look like what the 12 28s there's 32,000
631.08s: of them all the way up there and it's
632.44s: because they're 7even pennies the people
635.00s: that are buying these are paying through
636.72s: their freaking NOS in terms of implied
639.52s: volatility how expensive these are for
641.44s: what they are they're going to Decay
643.16s: away exceedingly fast again as a
645.88s: percentage of the premium look at this
647.80s: right now they're bid off or seven and a
649.92s: half wide something like that or seven
651.32s: and a half total the mid and if you take
654.12s: a look at the Theta Decay it's 4 cents
657.80s: after a couple days pass these are zero
660.00s: they're worth nothing so again it's that
662.68s: Punch's chance it's a tough way to make
664.16s: money in here so as always if there's
665.88s: any questions let me know I'm going to
667.52s: keep following this as I see anything
669.48s: interesting going on right now this
670.92s: looks like it's dying out to me that's
672.28s: what I'm seeing but if we get a poping
673.72s: ball or something that draws my eye I'm
675.68s: back in here with you guys but otherwise
677.40s: if there's any questions always let me
678.88s: know be an outlier see you guys later
