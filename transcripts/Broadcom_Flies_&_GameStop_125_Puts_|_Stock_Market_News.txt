0.64s: what's up allers time for a market
2.16s: update today we'll go over the market as
4.00s: a whole pretty quick then we'll take a
5.44s: look at broadcom couple other stocks and
7.32s: at the end I want to answer a question
9.20s: that somebody hit me up on Twitter or X
11.56s: or whatever the platform is known as
13.64s: we'll go with X because I want to
15.04s: support daddy Elon and it was about some
18.80s: deep in the money puts in GameStop and I
22.48s: think the conversation in GameStop is
25.60s: useful for non- GameStop traders to talk
28.96s: about those puts so we'll get to those
30.84s: towards the end now from a broad Market
34.04s: perspective definitely Tech led the
36.64s: dance today qes hit a high of 539 spy
40.92s: still trending sideways and I do believe
44.24s: internal to spy we're seeing a not
47.88s: insignificant amount of rotation so what
50.96s: I mean by that is we can see energy is
53.52s: really opening up to the downside I was
55.44s: actually shorting this specifically from
58.28s: the breakout perspective from the
59.56s: downside this has been unrelenting
61.96s: financials are still starting on this
64.80s: downside Trend we can see the different
66.48s: term moving averages 1020 are actually
69.20s: starting to roll over which is not good
71.60s: Industrials rolling over which is not
73.96s: great so we can see across the board
78.04s: other than discretionary which continues
79.96s: to just do literally whatever it wants
83.40s: um we can see healthc care down
85.76s: utilities down real estate
87.92s: down that means if we have a decent
92.88s: amount of sectors within the S&P 500
95.68s: rolling over even though the S&P 500 can
98.08s: be holding on and the reason for that is
99.92s: because it's propped up by a smaller
101.56s: number of names in com Services which is
103.44s: doing well along with a couple other
106.12s: tickers that happen to be doing well at
107.72s: the point but if we look across the
109.08s: overall breadth it's not good we lost
111.96s: another 5 oh you guys can't see this top
114.24s: line up here there's uh a little ticker
116.28s: bar that you can add now there's a
117.68s: couple things that I use up there like
119.20s: Advanced decline Advanced decline spread
121.28s: for the New York Stock Exchange for the
124.44s: S&P 500 and then one of the things I
126.72s: track up there is the percentage of
128.84s: stocks within the S&P 500 that are above
130.84s: a 50-day moving average and right now
133.04s: that's down like another five points to
135.96s: 43% so that's continuing to to roll over
139.04s: these are all early warning signals this
141.44s: is why when people get caught to the
143.68s: downside and again I'm not forecasting
145.76s: or expecting some sort of big downside
148.08s: move my job is to understand what's
149.32s: happening right now as best as I
151.44s: possibly can and but this is the comical
154.24s: part when people get caught to the
155.36s: downside and they're like well that came
156.56s: out of nowhere how did it happen this is
158.20s: how it starts now that doesn't mean that
160.32s: we're going down everything could level
162.08s: off and then start accumulating to the
163.72s: upside again you have to trade what's
165.32s: happening right now but right now there
167.64s: are warning signs that underlying
170.36s: conditions are changing and you should
172.08s: be aware of that that doesn't mean you
173.40s: have to take everything off and not put
174.88s: on a trade and and wait for the down
176.80s: tick because it might never come often
178.96s: it doesn't
180.36s: but it also can so that's why we have to
183.36s: pay attention to this stuff and then the
185.76s: equal weighted S&P 500 was down a little
188.60s: bit today so that was down a little over
190.84s: a quarter point so again that's showing
193.12s: you the Divergence between the S&P 500
195.36s: being propped up by a smaller number of
197.20s: names against the S&P 500 equal weighted
200.20s: which is looking at it as a whole very
203.00s: interesting overall Market movements
205.44s: today now from a general news
208.04s: perspective there was a couple things I
210.36s: wasn't paying super super close
212.72s: attention today there's a couple things
214.44s: in here that stuck out to me and then
216.24s: for those that don't know I actually I
217.44s: recently did a video for bar chart about
220.12s: some options trading tips if you've not
223.08s: seen it I encourage you to check it out
224.64s: and leave a comment to show up and show
226.56s: out for the outliers show some love over
228.92s: there um it's like five tips for options
231.28s: trading just general stuff a lot of you
233.08s: will know most of it but I actually
234.64s: think there might be a couple things in
235.84s: there that might be uh net new news so
240.60s: there's a ton of conversation going on
243.44s: around the AI theme which makes sense I
246.92s: totally understand that and this is
249.28s: interesting I I didn't know this
250.52s: actually Canada's Finance Minister
252.48s: resigns as unpopular Trudeau faces
254.64s: biggest test of his political career
256.40s: I've been seeing a lot of clips of
257.72s: Trudeau
259.48s: getting I don't want to call it slammed
261.76s: that's a little dramatic but definitely
263.12s: not seemingly to be in a in a great
266.04s: position during the the points that he's
267.76s: making and the counter points being made
269.16s: but fun fact I'm going to go visit the
270.64s: the Canadians out there if any of you
271.96s: are Canadian I'm coming to your place
274.20s: soon we're going to go to Calgary so
276.08s: that we can go to B and then go up to
278.60s: like Jasper just go do that whole Rocky
281.16s: Mountain Range thing there but we'll go
284.08s: see what's up maybe we'll run into the
285.36s: finance prime minister um let's see this
288.40s: next one us to require passenger
289.80s: vehicles to sound alarms if rear
291.24s: passengers don't fasten their seat belts
293.12s: that's terribly
295.28s: annoying um this is all just kind of
298.28s: speculative stuff I don't think we have
299.76s: to dive too far into that let's take a
301.84s: look at the just a couple other broad
303.76s: Market metrics that i' like to look at
305.84s: which are Advanced decliners more
308.36s: declining again today 58% 49% so we
311.20s: still are seeing decliners expand which
314.76s: we don't necessarily want to
317.48s: see
320.56s: and yeah so these are also growing a
323.40s: little bit so that's also not great
325.68s: stocks around their moving averages
327.52s: let's take a look at the sectors SES it
331.40s: definitely uptick on percentage above a
334.52s: 5 day 5 day so this is good this is
337.16s: stabilization normally what we want to
339.52s: see is the relationship and how these
342.08s: are trending so like take a look at
343.44s: materials for example 32% or above a 200
346.76s: day then 36% or above the the 150 let's
350.12s: just pretend that this trend continued
352.12s: going that means that something is
353.88s: generally in some sort of recovery or
356.64s: Ascent across the index as a whole but
359.40s: or the sector as a whole but that's not
361.08s: really so much the case for any of these
362.76s: most of this stuff is actually rolling
365.24s: over even it you can see it's 51% that's
368.80s: half of the sector is below short-term
372.48s: moving averages which is again tending
374.80s: to be stuff rolling over and then Comm
377.28s: Services was the the main leader here
380.08s: but take a look at this 50% of them were
382.48s: above their 20-day but 32 are above the
386.04s: five so literally all of that summarized
390.04s: into it does look like there's a bit of
392.56s: underlying rotation going on and it's
396.16s: something that I like to keep an eye on
398.28s: now let's take a look we'll take a look
399.48s: at GameStop in one second I want to take
401.28s: a look at avgo first really quick just
403.12s: take a look at this parabolic move it
405.20s: had earnings on the 12th after the
408.28s: market and it had a massive Gap up on
413.48s: the 13th and another Gap up
416.36s: here this is a big stock this is a
419.24s: really big stock to have this kind of
421.76s: move it had a really solid earnings it
425.32s: was expected at A113 came in at $142 big
428.48s: gap up this is the kind of thing that we
431.64s: try to pay attention to for post
434.08s: earnings announcement drift so for the
436.76s: way that I typically would trade that on
438.44s: this Gap this becomes bottom end stop
441.92s: which is might be something that's on
444.20s: right now to try to follow along with
445.72s: this thing and then the stop gets moved
447.24s: up to here because
450.32s: there's no reason especially on these
452.76s: really big parabolic moves a lot of
454.44s: times they will roll right back over and
456.68s: that doesn't mean that they're coming
457.56s: all the way back down but it typically
459.80s: shows an opportunity to take profits
462.68s: re-enter in a consolidation but this
464.80s: also could pull uh Tesla on us and Tesla
468.28s: just said see you later nerds and it's
470.08s: not come back well I guess it did come
471.56s: back a little bit in here but since here
473.48s: see you later nerds not come back okay
476.96s: so let's take a look on X there was
479.92s: somebody that uh tagged me on this who
484.36s: was it give props for Joseph GM Cobra
488.36s: Kai drop that and then I'll let you know
490.96s: that I'm doing a video I'll throw the
492.52s: video below this so what this is showing
496.32s: is this person saying been seeing a lot
498.44s: of volume on the 125 16 gen 26 put
501.40s: strike but today some unusual movement
503.28s: in the 125 the
505.52s: 25s and so the question then back ends
508.72s: like why are there these pretty big
511.32s: trades going on on these really deep in
513.72s: the money put so let's talk about it now
517.20s: there's a few things that we can glean
519.60s: from options the first thing that we
522.64s: have to keep in mind is pretty simple
525.52s: and that's there are a lot of parties
527.76s: doing a lot of different things so if we
530.32s: go out here to the 16 j26 if we go to
534.88s: the 12 125s we can see that there's
536.72s: 4,300 puts here and that's a lot lot of
539.68s: them especially if you look at the
541.16s: comparable ois for across the chain and
543.28s: whatnot that might beg the question
545.40s: what's why are people doing this way out
547.24s: here and let's talk about this trade
549.76s: first before we go to the the 2025
552.48s: example one of the things that will
554.84s: actively happen is what we call Delta
557.04s: trading and that's when we try it's what
560.24s: I do for my ratio call diagonals ratio
562.64s: put diagonals we go further out in time
566.00s: and we go really deep in the money you
567.92s: go further out in time because you pay
571.08s: overall more Theta but you have way less
575.64s: per day Theta Decay so if we take a look
577.88s: at this these are losing about 2 cents a
580.56s: day in Theta and then if we go to
582.92s: something like these 67s you'll and we
585.08s: take a look at the Theta these are
586.32s: losing three four five these are losing
589.72s: way more Theta so that's one of the
592.44s: reasons why we might go that far out in
593.92s: time we want to decrease our Theta but
595.68s: we want to play Delta because this
597.16s: essentially will have a Delta of one
598.64s: don't pay attention into this Delta it's
600.16s: all skewed because of the volatility in
602.24s: the underlying you can kind of follow
603.88s: the theme here right so 27 Delta 31 33
606.48s: 35 37 38 goes all the way up to 42
609.16s: before it breaks and here is when it
611.16s: would keep going up from 42 so this
612.88s: isn't actually lower Deltas here than
614.96s: this that's just skewed from volatility
617.04s: so these essentially would be a Delta of
618.88s: one not perfectly one because these
622.44s: still have plenty of extrinsic value on
624.08s: them but pretty close to a Delta of one
627.16s: so that's the first thing playing Delta
629.12s: this second thing is standard Arbitrage
633.48s: opportunities so a lot of times you'll
635.72s: notice that if you go deeper and deeper
637.64s: in the money what do you notice about
638.76s: the bidas spread if we take a look at
640.76s: these 29 puts the bitas spread is 50
642.80s: Cents if we take a look at these 50s the
645.52s: bass spread is almost $2 if we go even
649.20s: deeper this bid ass spread is over
652.92s: $3 so or I'm sorry over $2 so what's
656.32s: going on here there's a liquidity Gap so
660.04s: there will also be different entities
662.96s: high frequency traders alos that are
665.48s: looking for pricing discrepancies based
667.36s: on where they can get a fill and they're
669.92s: speculating this isn't necessarily a
672.28s: directional speculation but more on
674.52s: arbitraging out a mispricing of an
676.44s: option and that doesn't surprise me
678.96s: because this is a really really small
680.92s: overall series of Trades the volume
682.60s: today in these 125s in 2025 at the 125
686.80s: is
687.76s: 104 the net change oi was seven over
691.28s: prior meaning seven were added today so
693.36s: it's 144 total so this could be some
696.48s: sort of entity that is finding
698.92s: mispricings in these options which is
701.00s: very common especially notice how weird
702.60s: the Deltas get they're all over W
704.36s: they're all over the place they're all
705.52s: out of whack because volatility is out
706.84s: of whack the volatility on these right
708.96s: now is out of 590 so when things are at
711.08s: streams like this they become more prone
713.28s: for those kind of price Discovery moves
716.40s: now the final thing that this could be
720.52s: is part of a much bigger portfolio or
724.28s: bigger trade theme just because there's
727.52s: one individual strike that's being
729.36s: transacted in one individual expiration
732.44s: doesn't inherently mean that that's the
735.64s: only thing that that person is looking
737.04s: at so if we take a look at the size of
739.36s: the trades for these puts which are
742.36s: right here we can see this I would wager
744.68s: this is the same entity getting in at a
746.48s: couple different points in time I'm just
748.24s: guessing I don't know but that's what it
749.60s: seems like to me and the first trade
751.96s: went out for 620k the second one went
753.92s: out for 381k so these are not small this
757.00s: is not going to be a standard retail
758.56s: Trader this is probably going to be part
761.92s: of a much bigger book that's being
764.40s: traded and it could be hedging activity
767.84s: because of some short GameStop position
771.12s: that they're trying to take risk off
773.28s: coming out not this far in time for that
775.56s: hedge would be very sus to me it
777.92s: wouldn't make a lot of sense Beyond the
779.44s: fact that you're not paying a lot of
780.56s: extrinsic value this is essentially all
782.12s: intrinsic value so that could be the
784.28s: case or it could be something that just
787.68s: complements a broader portfolio rarely
791.08s: do options Traders look at each
794.04s: individual options tra uh trade and kind
797.52s: of analyze it in a vacuum we don't
799.52s: really care about that we care about it
801.08s: in context but what I really care about
805.00s: is if I have options in this stock this
806.96s: stock this stock this stock this stock
809.32s: what is my overall net Deltas across
811.76s: everything what is my overall gamma
813.76s: What's My overall Theta what's my vulga
815.92s: like I care about those things because
819.00s: all of those options are going to move
820.28s: in different ways and you have to pay
821.52s: attention to the total risk that you
822.80s: have out and how so Cliff noes version I
826.32s: have no idea who this is or what
828.24s: it is there's nothing in this that's
830.04s: like shocking to me this is pretty
832.00s: common for these really deep in the
833.56s: money options there's going to be trades
835.32s: that come through like this you can see
836.64s: that there was
837.68s: 268 that were
839.92s: um net added on the 105 so it's like
842.72s: that doesn't totally surprise me to see
845.68s: these changing the way that they are but
849.32s: it is always fun to talk about how
851.68s: markets behave and why these kinds of
853.52s: things can be going on so those are a
855.08s: few reasons it could be somebody
856.96s: speculating it could be somebody hedging
858.64s: it could be high frequency trading
860.28s: that's taking advantage of mispricings
862.08s: it could be part of a bigger trade some
863.96s: sort of pairish trade between these lots
867.12s: of lots of different things so
869.64s: markets are Dynamic lots of reasons for
871.84s: people to do what they want as always
873.40s: hit me up with what you're looking at
874.88s: what you want me to take a look at I
876.36s: love talking about the stuff that's
877.76s: interesting to you guys be an outlier
879.16s: I'll see you later
