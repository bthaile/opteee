0.00s: You ask I answer with another question from the homie Zach.
3.88s: The last one on this list is tips when buying leaps.
6.88s: It's a great question.
8.08s: Now leaps are really, really solid for serving as a levered stock replacement.
13.64s: However, there are a couple things that you have to pay attention to.
17.52s: If we think of different expiration cycles, so we have kind of the front expiration cycle
23.24s: here and then we have the back way out here.
26.00s: As you go further out, liquidity is going to drop.
31.12s: Most people will play the front portion of the expiration cycles.
36.16s: The other thing when liquidity drops is the bid-ass spread, widens.
42.16s: So when trying to find good leaps to trade, liquidity becomes even more important, not
48.12s: just from the context of your entry, but also your exit.
51.88s: The other thing is when you're playing leaps, you have to remember the effect of gamma.
56.64s: If we go back to this expiration thing, gamma is going to be high in the front.
62.28s: And gamma is low as you go further out here.
66.76s: So gamma down here is low.
68.96s: But the other thing we know is Vega is high and Vega here is low.
74.12s: We also know that there's more x-trends that value across the options chain because there's
78.32s: more time.
79.76s: So you need to balance all of these different factors to figure out what you want because
83.80s: if you're looking for something and your sandball, I don't know how much it's going to
88.28s: move, maybe it'll be more of a modest move, then maybe you need more deltas, but it's
92.28s: going to be a little bit more expensive.
94.00s: So the most important thing when you're looking to trade leaps is you have to understand
98.24s: how options behave in this way so that you can build what makes sense based on your idea.
104.40s: The liquidity is going to be the biggest thing hands down, then it's selecting Greeks that
109.60s: make the most sense.
110.60s: Great question.
111.60s: You know, I'll see you all there.
