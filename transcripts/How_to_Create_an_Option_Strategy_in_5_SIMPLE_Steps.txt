0.00s: if your idea of trading options
1.86s: successfully long term is predicated on
4.62s: listening to what other people or
6.60s: entities do and applying their
9.60s: strategies you're gonna be sadly
11.40s: mistaken it doesn't work very well that
13.98s: way so what I want to walk you through
15.72s: is how to become self-sufficient I'm
18.30s: going to show you five pretty simple
20.10s: steps on how to create your own
23.10s: strategies that you understand that you
25.80s: trust and that you can consistently
27.54s: deploy to make money Trading long term
30.24s: without relying on other people to do
33.00s: the work for you and haphazardly apply
35.64s: their approaches what's up everybody
36.90s: Eric here welcome back to all the
38.34s: outliers let's jump straight into it so
40.32s: the very first thing here our very first
42.54s: step is to outline the structure so what
44.88s: I'm talking about here and I have an
47.16s: excerpt from my kind of personal trading
50.52s: plan and this is the summary the
53.16s: executive summary aspect of the coverage
54.90s: strangle and the whole idea here is I
57.54s: wanna outline what this strategy is in
60.96s: general what it's supposed to behave
63.00s: like and what is included in it so what
66.00s: do I mean by that if you're a new Trader
67.74s: and you want to trade a vertical spread
69.66s: you would list the legs long call short
72.84s: call whatever it is and all we're doing
75.24s: is making sure that we understand at a
77.52s: base level what this thing even is then
79.98s: once we list out the legs as in what's
81.96s: in there we're gonna just highlight very
84.00s: quickly how it behaves what I like to do
86.04s: is set up a Word document as you can see
88.02s: over here and I split it up into
89.70s: different sections that essentially I
91.74s: call strategy outlines that's all this
93.96s: is and the purpose behind this is we are
96.60s: starting to add some structure around a
99.96s: very complex system so that we can then
102.78s: manipulate different variables and see
105.36s: what works best and I know what you're
107.22s: thinking Eric that sounds like a lot of
109.08s: work
110.04s: no we're trying to become
112.86s: successful Traders when we know 93 of
116.82s: Traders fall out within five years and
119.40s: then there's even a small subset of
120.96s: those that continue beyond five years
122.76s: that aren't even profitable so
124.56s: essentially out of a total pool of 100
126.48s: people you are trying to land somewhere
129.06s: in the top four percent of them you're
131.16s: not willing to do some work to get there
132.90s: you're not gonna get there so let's move
134.82s: on now to our next step which is the
136.56s: initial rules this is a really important
138.36s: one and it's primarily because new
140.52s: Traders they don't even know what to put
142.02s: in here and I don't blame them I didn't
143.70s: know either so the idea here is when
146.04s: we're creating our initial rule set we
148.62s: don't know what's important we don't
150.54s: know what's not important so the whole
152.94s: idea in doing this is to make some
155.64s: assumptions we are guessing that days to
158.40s: expiration matters to us in One Way Or
160.92s: Another We're guessing maybe Delta
162.96s: matters depending on the strategy so
164.76s: we're gonna pick different things that
166.92s: we think matter and over time as you
169.38s: deploy the stress strategy you'll find
171.30s: out and again in the beginning there's a
173.46s: lot of trial and error you can do as
174.96s: much research as you possibly can to
176.70s: shorten the time frame but realistically
178.68s: nonetheless it's going to take a little
180.30s: bit of time and that's okay so I want to
182.22s: like re-emphasize here that there was
184.08s: work involved but if you do your work in
186.60s: a diligent manner one of the Beautiful
188.22s: Things is what you do here will carry
190.62s: over to other strategies so say for
193.08s: example we're talking about the covered
194.46s: strangle specifically like right here
195.90s: and I don't know anything about it I'm
197.70s: gonna guess that I want to trade the
200.40s: short put 21 days out why I don't know
203.22s: I'm just picking a day later on we're
205.56s: going to track how this performs
207.72s: compared to other variants and then
209.52s: we'll start to understand what different
211.38s: days to expiration do to the strategy
214.26s: and how it behaves this is how we
216.78s: actually learn how options work this is
220.02s: a absolute must-have every single
222.36s: strategy needs to have profit and loss
224.46s: management baked into the strategy
226.08s: somewhere and again you can have
228.00s: different variants of this for the
229.62s: people that follow tastytrade you're
231.30s: going to hear a lot of 50 Max profit and
233.52s: things like that for people who don't do
235.50s: that you might try 65 Max profit which
238.50s: is actually for a lot of my strategies
240.18s: what I've found to work better than 50
242.22s: so you gotta test different things here
244.62s: and we'll walk into that but you got to
246.48s: Define it early so this is kind of like
248.34s: the max profit that we're wanting to
250.38s: take this is the max loss we are willing
252.60s: to allow and then life cycle management
254.52s: are things like if I sell a short put
257.04s: and it's a 30 Delta short put and it's
259.50s: in the money with 20 days left what do I
261.66s: want to do if it's in the money with 10
263.16s: days left what do I want to do do I want
264.90s: to roll out do I want to roll out and
267.06s: down do I want to wait do I want to take
269.10s: it to assignment there are different
270.72s: variables that you can list and again in
273.12s: the beginning you won't know all of them
274.92s: and that's okay you are just going to
276.60s: list your best guesses up front and then
280.14s: we're gonna get into how we can optimize
282.18s: this so leads into our next Point
283.92s: beautifully which is how do we track if
286.56s: 21 days is better how do we know if 30
289.14s: days for or a long haul is good for an
292.98s: 80 Delta deep in the money long call if
295.80s: volatility is high or low you can get to
298.26s: all of those answers but the way we do
300.36s: it is we are very structured so that
303.66s: it's not this haphazard approach this is
305.88s: probably one of the defining features
307.80s: about me and the way that I trade
310.02s: compared to other people is that I am
312.18s: the same idiot and degenerate is
314.58s: everybody else out here I literally am
316.56s: just a random dude now on the internet
318.54s: but I am straight up like everybody else
320.88s: but the difference is what I started to
323.40s: do was this work that people don't like
325.86s: to do but what it enables me to do is
328.26s: understand definitively what makes the
330.84s: most sense out of the different
332.16s: variables that can be tied into any
334.44s: individual trade or any individual
336.48s: strategy and then I can optimize off of
339.24s: those that is the purpose of this so
341.28s: when we're thinking about creating a
342.60s: trade log this I typically do in Excel
344.40s: or in a Google sheet and I'm going to
346.26s: list out what I think the key variables
348.24s: are what I emphasize here for people is
350.70s: do your best to include too many up
352.62s: front but enough that you will actually
354.84s: fill out the trade log that's the
357.06s: balance we want as much information when
359.22s: we're first learning as we possibly get
360.96s: our hands on but you have to make it
363.06s: that it's something that you'll actually
364.32s: fill out so if it's like something that
366.30s: you start you're like man this is a lot
367.56s: of work I'm not going to do it then you
368.82s: got to cut some stuff out but there's a
370.38s: trade-off you're cutting out probably
371.70s: usable information one way or another
373.50s: that you would like to have so think
375.36s: about that very carefully but some
377.64s: examples on what variables you'd want to
379.98s: track I think all of the Greeks are a
382.08s: great starting point the primary Greeks
383.64s: at least so um Delta gamma Theta Vega
387.18s: row if you're trading any sort of long
389.94s: dated options but otherwise I wouldn't
391.92s: worry about row if you're doing any
394.02s: buying or selling I would look at
395.58s: implied volatility implied volatility
397.56s: percentile realized or historic
399.84s: volatility those matter for most of
402.18s: those strategies I would want to track
404.40s: um also days to expiration what
406.38s: different you know windows we have when
408.12s: we're managing things because you'll
409.56s: start to understand if I am trading 30
412.26s: Delta short strangles what am I when are
414.66s: they getting challenged most frequently
416.28s: is it when I first put them on is it
417.90s: three days in seven days in you can
419.58s: create data sets around all of this and
421.74s: make informed decisions Next Step here
424.20s: we have create a log with different
426.84s: variables so we're creating the initial
429.12s: rules here then we're creating a log to
431.28s: track those rules then all we're doing
433.08s: is the same exact thing it could be in
435.00s: the same sheet wherever you want but
436.56s: just put in different rules so if we say
438.36s: that we're going to sell put seven days
439.92s: to expiration maybe try five days maybe
442.14s: try ten days pick different ones don't
444.36s: pick so many that you're not going to be
446.64s: able to track it but pick a bunch to
448.26s: start because the way that we make this
451.26s: consumable is we go in order of
454.44s: increasing Fidelity and increasing time
457.38s: commitment so what I mean by that is the
459.36s: back test is the least useful tool out
462.12s: of this and the most useful tool out of
464.94s: this what the hell does that mean well
466.74s: if I back test I don't trust those
468.90s: results I do not not think that if I do
471.42s: exactly what I did I'm gonna get back
473.46s: test results but if I back test and the
476.16s: results look bad I'm not even going to
477.96s: bother because if you can't make a
479.70s: strategy look good back testing good
482.04s:  luck making it look good using
484.68s: real markets real emotions actually
487.08s: trading so this is a very simple first
490.14s: step to process the information to get
492.78s: rid of all of the things that don't look
494.58s: good right out of the gate and then to
496.68s: focus on a smaller subset so if we have
499.20s: the initial rules this is our best guess
501.18s: what we think will be the best structure
503.34s: or the best strategy for an option
504.90s: structure then we try 15 different
507.00s: variables on all different conditions
509.34s: after that we backtest it we now have
511.92s: seven that still look okay now we go
514.38s: into some sort of on-demand or paper
516.48s: trading so say for example part of your
518.70s: process here includes technical analysis
520.56s: of some sort totally cool maybe when
522.72s: you're testing via on-demand meaning
524.70s: looking back in time that's a TD
526.56s: Ameritrade functionality where you can
528.24s: actually fast forward time which is
529.56s: really nice but if you can't do that you
531.30s: could just look at previous charts and
532.74s: you can say okay this is what it did
534.12s: here this is when I would have gotten in
535.80s: and let's see how it did so this is a
538.26s: more manual process it's the next step
540.36s: moving from back testing to actually
542.28s: seeing with a little more detail on how
544.56s: something would behave and then the last
545.94s: one is starting to go live we start
547.74s: small we put on smaller positions we try
550.80s: some different maybe the top one or two
553.02s: three variants but in a very small size
555.60s: control environment and we monitor how
558.12s: that works overall creating an option
561.18s: strategy from an option structure is not
563.70s: that difficult it requires some legwork
565.86s: so if you have any questions let me know
567.48s: don't forget like subscribe be an
568.98s: outlier I'll see you guys later
