2.08s: hey everybody eric here i was lucky
4.16s: enough to randomly find matt on twitter
7.28s: and i actually looked through your stuff
9.04s: a little bit like i was just telling you
10.40s: and
11.20s: i love a lot of what you talk about and
13.52s: you have an interesting background so
15.44s: first off welcome to the channel
17.60s: thank you thank you thanks for having me
18.80s: it's a pleasure yeah and i'm really
20.88s: looking forward to the conversation so
22.88s: um i figured as always it's really
24.72s: helpful to just start with a little bit
26.16s: of level setting maybe get a little bit
27.92s: of your background you know you gave me
29.28s: a little bit of a preamble but i would
31.44s: love to understand uh two main things
33.76s: the first one is how did you get started
36.24s: in trading or investing kind of
37.84s: whichever you more closely identify with
39.76s: i think it's trading but we'll see and
41.60s: then the second one is just walk me
44.72s: through kind of an evolution from that
46.64s: start to where you are now
49.60s: okay thanks well you know so uh first of
51.68s: all i'm just happy to be on your you
53.44s: know marine veteran like i was saying
55.12s: before we started the call i always
56.72s: respect people have such passion and
58.40s: work so hard that's i think that's key
60.48s: for success in anything that you got to
62.00s: do in life and i think the marines
63.60s: probably represent that better than
65.12s: anything else out there so
66.88s: um so just a bit of my background uh
69.68s: my dad you know he kind of loved the
71.28s: markets but it was it was in his day job
72.96s: it's something you like to do on the
73.92s: side and so from when i was a real young
75.92s: kid he always tried to like kind of talk
77.20s: to me about it about it and stuff and
78.96s: the first share i bought was wendy's i
80.80s: bought five shares i think i was eight
82.64s: or nine years old it's because we used
84.24s: to drive to florida every year in the
86.08s: summer time and i used to stop at
87.28s: wendy's and i said my dad said well if
88.56s: you like it buy buy some shares so i
90.08s: bought five and i kept track of it for
91.52s: years
92.40s: uh but really what really kind of got me
94.64s: really into the markets was i i think i
96.80s: was
97.76s: maybe 16 i forget now exactly but i read
99.84s: how to make money in stocks by william
101.68s: o'neill and that that book kind of like
104.24s: blew me away like my dad was a more
106.40s: value investor at the time warren
108.40s: buffett type stuff and i i tried to kind
110.16s: of read that in my you know glance at it
111.92s: and it was boring when i read bill
113.84s: o'neil's book that was like you know the
116.00s: angels sang and i said wow this is
118.16s: really interesting because i was always
119.60s: you know the market always appealed to
121.12s: me but i just never really clicked as a
122.56s: passion obviously i was a kid right so
124.40s: sure but once i read that book uh what i
126.64s: really liked about it was the charting
128.08s: section i just i just found it so
129.36s: interesting that because you know
130.72s: especially when you first approach the
132.16s: market your your only question is you
134.00s: know when do i buy when or what do i buy
136.16s: and and to see on a chart which i'd
137.84s: never seen a stock chart before that
139.44s: that book
140.56s: to say like you know if you draw a trend
141.92s: line here if this past this point this
143.20s: is where you buy and then this stock
144.40s: went up 200 percent it was like
146.72s: wow this
147.68s: that's how you you know that is the
148.80s: secret for the markets and
150.48s: i kind of went down my path and i became
152.88s: a chartered market technician i pretty
154.16s: much read every book i could on
156.08s: technical analysis i majored in
157.76s: economics
159.04s: and i basically traded ever since i got
161.60s: that i read that book even while i was
163.52s: in university
164.96s: and that kind of landed in my first job
166.56s: where i was a market maker pro trader
168.32s: right at university and um also i became
171.44s: president of the canadian society of
172.72s: technical analysts and that led to me
174.08s: actually i was a year out of university
175.68s: and i was asked to come back to be a
177.04s: finance professor for university
179.04s: graduates so finally and you know funny
180.64s: enough i was
181.76s: probably a year older than most people
182.96s: in the class and i was teaching that
184.00s: class and it's still being taught today
185.68s: actually i don't teach it anymore but
186.80s: it's still it's a very popular course
189.36s: and well you know long story short i i
191.36s: became a charter financial analyst in
193.12s: 2020 i joined the us investing
195.20s: championship where i gained a little bit
196.40s: of popularity and um today i still
199.04s: invest for myself and i have my website
200.96s: caruso insights
203.20s: awesome so it's funny be like i just
205.92s: really identify with how you got started
207.84s: it's super similar to to how i got
210.00s: started
210.96s: um where it was you know uh
213.76s: essentially just bought a couple shares
215.68s: of stuff that i liked and looked
217.60s: interesting it's i think that's so
219.60s: curious how for a lot of people that's
221.04s: how we get started right is you start
222.88s: with what you see what you know and
224.48s: you're like well i like wendy's so gonna
226.16s: start with them
227.60s: um
228.48s: so
230.08s: when you started finding this draw to
233.36s: technical analysis
235.44s: what was your initial impression towards
238.24s: it and the reason why i'm asking that
240.32s: specific question is
242.56s: my my background is
245.68s: very limited technical analysis i use
248.32s: some of it um but it's definitely a bit
251.12s: of a balance of
253.36s: technical fundamental and then a lot of
255.28s: just options data
257.04s: so i'm really curious when you were
259.28s: looking at or reading the book maybe
261.68s: that's you know really where it hit for
263.20s: you but what drew you to technical
264.80s: analysis over the value investing that
267.36s: your dad was doing was it simply the
269.44s: chart or what was it
271.60s: well you know most the like the
274.24s: the books at that time for for technical
276.72s: analysis were mostly futures guys
278.24s: commodity guys because in the in the 80s
279.84s: 90s up until recently the technical
281.52s: analysis was like in the realm of
283.36s: commodity futures trading not for stock
285.04s: stocks was the respectable place where
287.20s: you you looked at financial statements
288.80s: and that was what you looked at
290.40s: but you know i think when you're a young
291.84s: guy you know you're 16 years old i mean
294.16s: risk doesn't exist none of that matters
295.84s: you want to make as much money as
297.28s: possible and so for me to see that you
299.12s: know so trying to buy a stock you know i
300.64s: was reading i think benjamin graham was
301.84s: one of the first books i tried to read
303.12s: where they talk about utility companies
304.72s: and a 10 return and when you look in
306.96s: your bank account and you have like 500
308.40s: dollars yeah i gotta do all this work
310.16s: for fifty dollars but so when i when i
312.00s: saw what bill neil was talking about in
313.68s: his book and the first thing he mentions
315.92s: is about controlling your risk and so it
318.16s: just kind of dawned on me you know how
319.76s: do you control your risk unless you can
321.20s: time your entry even at a young age you
323.20s: know made a lot of sense to me
325.28s: and as i jumped into the technical
326.88s: analysis kind of stuff and all these
328.32s: guys were mostly futures commodity
329.76s: traders and i saw the leverage that
331.36s: existed out there so as a young guy
333.44s: again there's only one thing that you're
335.04s: focused on so i said oh so i with you
337.20s: know five or ten thousand dollars of
338.80s: money save part-time i can buy you know
340.96s: a hundred and twenty thousand dollars
342.32s: worth of like gold or crude oil
343.84s: contracts and and that's for a period of
345.92s: time when i was you know really young
347.36s: living at home and having like you know
348.80s: count moves up and down of like hundreds
350.56s: of percent and uh you know up and then
353.04s: crashes back down it wasn't there
354.56s: definitely not a stairway to heaven i'll
355.76s: tell you that much and um so that i just
357.92s: got immersed in tech it was all about
359.44s: timing and all of that and i became
361.28s: obsessed with it and and with time
363.68s: you know now i use a lot of fundamentals
365.20s: in my approach but the technical
366.64s: analysis served me well because my first
368.16s: job as a market maker and day trader was
370.64s: i mean really when it comes down to it
372.24s: it's all technical i mean okay it's not
374.32s: always chart some of it is also reading
375.76s: market data like you mentioned options
377.28s: data
378.48s: but you're talking about the mechanics
380.16s: of the market so it's really a different
381.84s: world than fundamental numbers i mean
384.48s: those there's impacts sometimes if
386.24s: there's news that comes out you have to
387.68s: assess the news what are they talking
389.12s: about and you learn that with time
391.12s: but ninety percent of what you're doing
392.64s: is technical in nature so it was a
394.64s: background especially for the first job
397.04s: and i guess you must be a mind reader
399.92s: because that was actually the next
401.12s: question i was going to ask you so talk
402.32s: to me a little bit about your time as a
403.52s: market maker you said you spent about
404.88s: what six years doing that
406.84s: yeah sorry i don't need to cut you off
408.96s: no go for it so it was six years uh one
411.60s: of the big banks here then they
413.04s: unfortunately they closed the division
414.56s: was post financial crisis reduced risk
416.80s: and i did a small stent another
418.24s: brokerage before i went on my own but
420.16s: the interesting thing is that you know
421.36s: when some people like kind of hear me
422.96s: speak now or whatever say oh you learned
424.48s: a lot of you know what you do now at the
425.84s: bank and
427.28s: ironically i remember i showed up
429.36s: i was 10 years younger than the next guy
431.04s: on the desk i was by far i was 22 the
433.12s: youngest guy and my supervisor said you
435.52s: know on the kids it was like one of
436.64s: those keyboard driven entry systems was
438.64s: like f1 is buy f4 sell f3 is short you
442.40s: know make us money and that was really
444.72s: pretty much
445.92s: all i had in terms of trading you know
447.68s: so the only training i got was really
449.60s: when a colleague next to me you know saw
452.00s: you know it was
453.28s: was you know saying hey matt why don't
454.56s: you try this you started doing all these
455.84s: charting and stuff and you showed me the
457.12s: kind of simpler methods they were doing
458.48s: the market making methods and no one
460.56s: ever puts that in the book because it's
461.92s: such my new detailed information and
464.48s: right and i learned quite a bit there so
466.24s: but uh but in general
467.92s: uh that was that was day one it was like
469.76s: this is buy sell and
471.36s: you know let's see at the end of the
472.40s: month how you do yeah get to clicking
474.00s: guy yeah yeah pretty much
476.64s: so if you were to synthesize i don't
478.64s: know maybe like the the top three or
480.96s: five things that you learned as a market
483.28s: maker what what are those things i think
485.60s: that first one is a interesting point
487.28s: you you feel free to add that to your
488.96s: list because i actually have a few
489.84s: friends who are market makers and i'll
492.24s: talk to them sometimes about trading and
494.00s: whatnot and it always surprises me
496.48s: the they have very nuanced information
499.36s: about their firm's approach but if
501.60s: you're to talk to them about other
503.12s: things they might know it because
504.56s: they're interested in it but they're not
506.00s: getting it from work necessarily
508.16s: and that always surprised me just how
510.08s: specialized a lot of the knowledge was
511.68s: for them but i'm curious what your maybe
513.28s: top three to five takeaways were from
514.96s: your time there
516.72s: uh well one is um
519.04s: you know what's interesting most people
520.64s: when they approach the market it's a big
522.00s: picture stuff you know fundamentals and
523.68s: that but there's there's a microcosm to
526.00s: the market the mechanics of the market
527.60s: much like you know you're in the
528.64s: military and and yeah you know everyone
530.72s: thinks about the strategy of war but
532.48s: then there's actually the actual
533.36s: day-to-day of what you're doing which
534.72s: are the two different skill sets so
537.04s: and and you know if ever you're trading
538.48s: in a volatile market even if you want to
540.48s: hold a stock for a 20 return but if the
542.56s: day-to-day swings in in a market like
544.48s: we're dealing with now or five or seven
546.16s: percent well if you step on you know the
549.20s: the wrong day and you're down seven
550.56s: percent the next day that dramatically
552.08s: impacts what you're doing so just the
553.36s: importance of the short-term mechanics
555.68s: and it's an important part of the
557.28s: toolbox to be able to control that even
559.12s: that short-term risk for long-term
560.84s: returns uh a second item i would i would
563.60s: really say is very important is is you
565.84s: get to read the buying and selling price
567.76s: you know pressure the buying and selling
569.20s: in canada we can all see the broker
570.48s: number so you could really read the data
572.00s: better and luckily i started before
574.64s: algos were there the hfts rather yep so
577.76s: i i really saw the impact of
579.44s: institutional investors it was was much
581.12s: clearer you can still see it but it was
582.48s: much clearer before it wasn't it wasn't
584.48s: distorted by like them trying to hide
586.64s: their tracks with algos and stuff like
588.16s: they do now so just that really the they
590.72s: really drive the trends and if you're
592.40s: gonna get this big uptrend you'll see
593.68s: that same buyer and and i you could
595.68s: notice it after time like oh you know we
597.12s: say hello you know number nine is back
598.48s: because that'd be the broker code and
600.24s: and bang you start buying all day again
602.08s: and you know you try and get ahead of
603.36s: him or whatnot and if you disappear you
605.36s: try and get out before the stock would
606.96s: come back down so just the real impact
609.84s: of institutional investors is not the
611.44s: retail investor it's not the day-to-day
613.12s: investor that moves the stock it's
615.12s: institutional that's so important
617.44s: and uh i guess you know let's say a
619.20s: third would be um
621.12s: the world i was in especially where i'm
623.44s: canadian it was a lot of resource
624.72s: companies
625.84s: and so you know i learned a lot about
628.00s: the um each company has a lot of
629.76s: specifics so you want to understand your
631.28s: company specifically but
633.20s: you know to be a good investor you also
634.64s: want to understand the macro picture so
636.08s: because i was in so many of these
637.20s: commodity stocks like you know oil gold
639.20s: they're really i mean you could be in a
640.48s: gold stock and oil opens down you know
643.36s: four percent the next day because of
644.64s: some geopolitical problem in kazakhstan
646.56s: or in russia you know and so so so it
649.12s: kind of made me
650.72s: ultra aware
652.08s: of all the variables that affect the
653.68s: stock and there's there's technical
655.12s: variables there's the individual stocks
656.72s: fundamental variables there's the
658.00s: institutional flows there's global macro
660.64s: problems so i think some people hear me
662.64s: talk and say well you know you have a
664.24s: lot of experience with different things
665.52s: just because i was kind of in a world
667.60s: where it kind of forced me to right you
669.36s: know you know each day you wake up you
670.72s: get slapped in the face you want to stop
672.16s: and say well what why did i why did i
673.44s: get slapped this time and you learned
674.96s: that skill set and it's just like this
676.40s: constant learning process so those are
678.48s: the three i guess big takeaways that i
680.80s: got from that experience that's pretty
682.88s: awesome especially that last one that
684.40s: you mentioned that's one of my favorite
685.44s: things about the markets in general is i
688.48s: always find that
689.92s: if you actively trade you generally are
692.48s: just a more informed human being because
695.92s: exactly what you're noting and one of my
697.84s: favorite things about
699.60s: the the markets as well especially in
701.20s: the u.s like we have a very polarized
703.60s: political environment every article you
705.52s: read leans one way or the other but a
707.52s: lot of financial stuff is pretty
709.04s: straightforward right it's like what
710.88s: impact does this have on making money
713.68s: and i actually always found a lot of
715.84s: reprieve in that perspective because i
718.00s: just get tired of reading the rest of
719.20s: the news you're like okay who wrote this
720.88s: what's their what's their angle right
722.88s: but
723.60s: that's interesting so what led to you
726.08s: jumping ship
727.60s: as a market maker to go be a professor
731.36s: so actually i did them simultaneously
733.20s: okay as i was trading i was it was a you
735.60s: know part-time professor gig so i i had
738.00s: one or two set first it was one section
739.60s: and two but it was you know night
741.28s: classes and my only the first section
743.44s: was during the day and you know i was a
745.28s: young guy 22 i had to ask my boss
746.88s: permission so i was actually i have
749.36s: i got some of my my students some of
750.80s: them are professional traders now too
752.24s: and and uh you know i'd be in the front
754.08s: of the class and i get a phone call from
755.28s: my buddy saying hey look you want me to
756.32s: hit the bid on this he told me to let me
757.60s: know if it's coming off and okay so i'd
759.20s: be giving like trades over the phone
760.64s: back then you know so that was that was
761.84s: fun but it was too much so after that i
763.84s: i spoke with the university to have it
765.36s: only uh night and night classes yeah
767.84s: well that's kind of cool that they're
768.96s: accommodating you though um yeah it was
771.28s: fun
772.64s: so what was your experience like as a
774.48s: professor dealing with um just you know
777.60s: students who are interested in it and
779.04s: again the caveat to this question is
781.12s: when i was working on my mba i actually
783.44s: took a handful of trading courses
786.88s: derivatives courses and
789.20s: i thought they were abysmal they
792.24s: were ancient it drove me nuts i was
795.68s: blown away that they were still trying
797.20s: to teach that stuff so i'm really
799.04s: curious what your experience was like
800.56s: you know creating materials and whatnot
802.72s: and just what the students were like
805.36s: so uh i was kind of fortunate with the
807.28s: school reached out to me it was a class
809.04s: that was like loosely based on technical
810.80s: analysis i i didn't get the outline of
812.64s: it but it was kind of that professor's
815.04s: own take on things and they said look
817.04s: you're the president of the csta and
818.88s: we'd like you to make a class so
820.64s: um
821.60s: i'm a cmt charterholder and so i reached
824.24s: out to the cmt association if they had
826.24s: any kind of tools and they actually had
827.68s: this program the mta educational
830.00s: foundation where they actually help you
831.60s: know professors get up and running so
832.88s: they have the kind of like curriculum
835.28s: so i kind of took that and that was
837.20s: probably 90 percent of what i used to
839.84s: it's basically the cmt program like
842.24s: level one was probably 80 to 90 percent
844.56s: of what i taught and then on top of that
846.72s: you know so the name of the class was
848.08s: how to build a profitable trading system
850.00s: oh cool so so i took basically all these
852.16s: technical tools but we have access to
854.16s: bloombergs and stuff like that terminal
855.76s: so
856.40s: you know the the course the had a
858.40s: project where they had to build a
859.44s: trading system they'd have to be complex
861.20s: sure but it had to be you know like
862.48s: moving average crossovers or you know
864.40s: 10-day breakout whatever it would be and
866.56s: so i kind of took all the technical
868.48s: tools but i made it that there would be
870.16s: um an application portion to it so
872.96s: that was that was fun it was interesting
874.56s: the only uh the reason i kind of stopped
877.04s: teaching at a certain point was you know
878.64s: time became difficult but out of a class
880.72s: of
881.52s: 50 60 students you know you have that
883.20s: four or five people that are really into
884.96s: it and everyone else would be you know
886.72s: arguing for grades i got a b plus could
888.56s: have an a minus and if you do it for one
890.40s: then after so it just kind of yeah i
892.64s: like i want to teach people who actually
894.08s: want to learn not because they're there
895.52s: to pass the class and and with trading i
898.32s: was so busy i just at a certain point i
899.68s: said look i had some you know
901.84s: some friends who wanted to teach are
903.12s: also you know in the field and they took
905.44s: over the class but that was uh that was
907.44s: my experience that's awesome it's i
909.60s: because i i find myself in the same
910.96s: exact just scenario where i really do
913.44s: enjoy teaching but i like teaching
915.12s: people who are interested in it right
916.96s: because i could totally see the the drag
919.04s: on you know just fighting over
920.56s: somebody's grades well b plus a minor
922.88s: well you should have done better then
924.16s: you get an a minus you know it's like
926.56s: you have a bad trading day you come to
927.92s: the class you teach like you don't feel
929.60s: like being here that day because you're
930.72s: thinking about what the heck you're
931.68s: gonna do with your position tomorrow and
933.44s: then this guy's saying like oh you know
934.72s: you gave he gave jim like uh you know an
937.28s: extra two days to work on the project
938.72s: because he said he wasn't feeling well i
939.84s: wasn't feeling well
942.08s: you know what you know like i mean like
943.36s: these are not
944.32s: 14 year old kids like you're 21 years
946.16s: old like you're like you're an adult
948.32s: like yeah like you know this is a an
950.16s: application course it's right before you
951.68s: graduate into the workforce you know
953.12s: like like i was my expectations are that
956.16s: you're here to learn because you want to
957.28s: apply you know but that's you know
958.48s: that's that's that's university right
959.92s: we're all there yeah at some point but
961.68s: just that was the situation that's
963.92s: interesting and then so you then you
966.24s: participated you said in the u.s
969.44s: championship yep okay and
971.92s: what what was that like i've heard of it
973.92s: before but i'm completely ignorant to it
976.00s: i don't know
977.04s: what i don't know what the you know the
978.40s: program is or anything like that so
980.24s: actually it goes back to the 80s i think
981.76s: some of the early participants were paul
983.28s: tudor jones who's the hedge fund
984.96s: multi-billionaire and yeah there's a lot
986.80s: of that you know david ryan who's a
988.48s: three-time champion mark minervini was
990.48s: champion it's a lot of the popular names
992.40s: that you know
993.44s: and so that went back to the 80s and it
995.44s: actually had stopped for for i think a
996.96s: good 15 years because the guy who runs
998.88s: it stopped through his own hedge fund
1000.16s: and so he came back to restart in 2019
1002.80s: and so when i saw that the competition
1004.16s: already started and all the guys i
1005.68s: looked up to starting out you know were
1007.76s: champions of this so i said wow i got to
1009.36s: get in there and try my hand at it and
1011.60s: so in 2020 i joined and uh i was always
1015.04s: top contender in september actually that
1017.04s: year i was in first place with 426
1019.60s: return which bro which broke the night
1021.68s: the uh the nine month record of the
1023.52s: championship going all the way back to
1024.80s: the 80s which i was proud of yeah and i
1026.56s: ended up finishing a top contender but i
1027.92s: didn't finish i kind of took my foot off
1029.20s: the gas i didn't realize stock's going
1030.40s: to go vertical or else i would have even
1031.84s: a better return but i finished with 346
1033.92s: percent but um
1035.44s: it gave me i think some good exposure
1036.88s: which uh i appreciate it and it's given
1039.04s: me a chance to teach again so that's
1040.32s: been a lot of fun so what like if you
1042.56s: were to summarize the experience
1045.36s: especially i'm curious what does that
1047.52s: experience feel like for you as compared
1050.08s: to just your normal trading career like
1052.80s: what what's the difference between what
1054.24s: you learned in that championship
1055.68s: compared to just your regular training
1057.76s: so it was it's funny because i didn't
1059.36s: have that pressure since i started
1061.20s: trading so when i started interesting
1063.52s: i i until i started trading
1065.04s: professionally i was trading for myself
1067.20s: so if i made
1068.56s: if i you know quadrupled my account and
1070.48s: futures contracts and then after i made
1072.32s: a mistake and it felt all the way back
1073.52s: down and i looked like a fool only i
1074.96s: knew that right so
1076.56s: you know when you love something you're
1078.40s: more concerned about being good at it
1080.40s: necessarily than making money like i
1081.68s: mean the point is to make money but
1083.20s: that's going to come with executing well
1085.28s: right and when i started trading
1086.64s: professionally at the bank and suddenly
1088.00s: had a manager watching my my p l saying
1090.00s: like oh no no you you can't have that
1091.60s: kind of drawdown or you know hey matt
1093.44s: how come how come it's two weeks where
1095.44s: you're struggling you know you're doing
1096.64s: great last month and this this month
1098.08s: your year down just that feeling of
1100.16s: someone watching over my p l when i
1102.24s: started that was the hardest part i
1104.24s: found that just psychologically um like
1106.64s: a pressure on me yeah then i got i got
1109.04s: used to that that was fine but then when
1110.48s: i entered the competition and this was
1112.72s: you know the competition was my
1114.56s: professional account so it wasn't like i
1116.24s: didn't take a small amount of money and
1117.92s: say hey let's let's rock it it was i
1119.52s: approached it like my my with my
1121.12s: professional funds that this is how i'm
1123.04s: going to trade
1124.24s: and then so suddenly like the whole
1125.68s: world while the whole world whoever is
1126.80s: watching the competition which became
1128.40s: very popular because myself and two or
1130.16s: three other guys were really knocking it
1131.60s: out of the park with right triple digit
1133.20s: returns
1134.16s: suddenly to have this month to month
1135.84s: where it's like you know you're trading
1137.20s: for money but then after saying oh but i
1139.20s: also you know am i out trading the other
1140.88s: guy and it created this pressure where
1143.36s: it's fun but at the same time like my
1145.44s: aim is supposed to be a profitable
1147.04s: trader it kind of created a bit of a
1148.40s: distraction that's why i didn't do it in
1149.84s: 2021 i said i want to kind of like
1151.52s: refocus and a lot of fun but it creates
1154.08s: kind of this like negative pressure in a
1155.84s: sense right so that would be the con of
1158.08s: the competition but the pro is that i
1159.52s: met some phenomenal people some really
1161.04s: nice guys and
1162.40s: you know we still still chat together
1163.84s: and so that's been a lot of fun good
1165.68s: that's awesome that's it's funny you
1167.60s: mentioned the part about having kind of
1170.08s: a second set of eyes on just your
1172.48s: performance
1173.84s: because that's one of the things that
1177.20s: my mentor started with me early on is
1180.40s: first he forced me to write out like a
1182.00s: trading plan but then we ended up doing
1184.48s: like a monthly review where it probably
1187.20s: obviously nowhere near the same degree
1188.72s: as you were you know it's like p l for a
1190.40s: company and they're like probably
1191.44s: looking at you every day but he and i
1193.60s: would do like a monthly review and i
1195.68s: found a lot of stuff that i would
1198.24s: rationalize in my head because of an ego
1201.04s: you know somebody starts poking holes
1202.64s: and you're like
1204.40s:  yeah i'm not making the greatest
1206.40s: decisions here and i found that to be
1208.56s: like actually tremendous growth
1210.08s: experience so i just resonated with me
1212.24s: when when you mentioned that you know as
1214.16s: part of your experience did they was it
1216.16s: like a daily you know review of your p l
1219.20s: with your boss and then like a weekly or
1221.92s: monthly roll up to
1223.84s: your boss's boss or something like that
1225.28s: or how did that work for you guys
1227.44s: to be honest it's funny like it was a
1229.20s: very laid-back experience as long as you
1231.20s: made money you could pretty much do
1232.64s: whatever you wanted as long as you were
1234.88s: making money and and almost every every
1237.44s: day week month i was making money i was
1239.12s: it was a fairly it was at that time it
1241.36s: was a very consistent type of strategy
1243.20s: yeah it's only if you got into like a
1244.88s: bit of a drawdown or something where
1246.16s: there'd be a conversation you know so
1247.84s: got it that was kind of i remember 2010
1249.92s: from for me was a really big year it was
1251.68s: probably as big as almost as big as my
1253.92s: 2020 year um and so then you know
1256.40s: whenever you have
1257.52s: i've had the experience whenever i have
1258.56s: a lot of big returns then after that's
1260.64s: where i would get hit because you know
1261.68s: you get maybe overconfident or you get a
1263.44s: little bit
1264.72s: cocky or or now you're just so
1266.72s: blindsided by profit like your your
1268.80s: mindset's not in a good place and um so
1271.52s: then after obviously that volatility
1272.72s: returns they said well we don't care
1273.76s: what you made last year just want to
1274.80s: remind you that was last year's profits
1276.32s: now this is a new year so i had you know
1278.72s: a bit of talking to at a certain point
1280.16s: where it's like okay like you know
1281.84s: in your mind it's like oh i made all
1282.96s: this money last year so if i give away
1284.32s: let's just average it out yeah no no no
1286.56s: that was a lot this is a company that
1288.08s: was already last year's earnings this is
1289.44s: a new year that we don't care about last
1291.52s: year anymore right so i learned you know
1293.84s: my buddy told me it was you know the guy
1296.16s: who stan explained that's like you're
1297.20s: only as good as your last trade matt
1298.56s: always remember that so just never never
1300.88s: blow up because they don't care what you
1302.16s: did before it's what you which what have
1303.36s: you done for me lately kind of thing
1304.88s: yeah that man what a that's crazy to me
1307.92s: like i get it but like as
1310.72s: i don't know like i'm a lifetime retail
1312.48s: trader so if i have a down year as long
1315.12s: as it doesn't hit like my kagger too
1317.04s: hard you know what i mean it like down
1319.44s: years might happen so it's just that's
1321.68s: an interesting perspective where you
1322.96s: might just knock it out of the park and
1324.40s: then the next you're like what the hell
1325.60s: is wrong with you guys yeah pretty much
1327.60s: yeah
1328.56s: that's wild
1329.92s: yeah um all right so
1332.40s: we talked a little bit about your
1333.76s: background um
1335.68s: i would love to know just a little bit
1338.00s: more about
1339.52s: your participation in the championship
1341.84s: so what was your general approach during
1345.28s: that and again just for my own
1347.12s: edification what was like the time frame
1348.88s: that you guys were trading like how long
1350.16s: does that championship go for so it's
1351.92s: the full year so it's okay from january
1353.84s: 1st to december 31st okay got it and so
1357.04s: that was you said 2020 yeah that's right
1359.44s: okay so what was like what was your
1361.84s: approach when you know january 1st
1363.76s: whatever the first trading day was um
1366.24s: you know
1367.12s: what were you thinking to start that
1368.56s: championship how are you going to crack
1369.92s: the nut
1371.76s: you know uh
1373.04s: my goal is really just to
1374.80s: to perform you know that's the funny
1376.00s: thing about the market you know is you
1377.76s: could think it's not like sports where
1379.20s: i'm going to try extra hard to make it
1380.80s: work
1381.84s: in the market i found just being as
1383.60s: disciplined as possible is just your
1385.28s: best chance i mean the market
1387.04s: may be conducive to your strategy that
1388.72s: year or may not because sometimes you
1390.48s: know you're not a bad trader it's just
1392.08s: the strategy you're you're implementing
1393.76s: this this current market environment is
1395.36s: not great but you know over the next
1396.88s: five years you're gonna make a ton of
1397.92s: money but over these three months it's
1399.20s: not so really my goal is just be as
1401.12s: disciplined as possible and and just
1403.44s: really make sure i i apply my strategy
1405.60s: to a key and it was just a great year
1407.76s: for it and um i the only difference is i
1410.48s: i started the year flat so with no
1412.00s: positions usually i'm always trading
1413.20s: myself i'm gonna really start at zero
1414.96s: and take it from there so there's no
1416.56s: impact of like last year's decision
1418.72s: making
1419.60s: and uh worked out really well i was uh
1422.32s: you know i think there was two big
1424.16s: things that really worked in my favor
1425.52s: that helped me to make them you know the
1427.12s: monster results were just basically i
1428.64s: was actually in florida
1430.40s: on vacation in february when covid was
1432.32s: starting and all my rules had me get the
1434.40s: cash and so i still remember you know
1436.48s: like my wife was at the beach with the
1437.68s: kids and i you know i'd go up in the
1438.88s: afternoon i'm sorry i wanted my son
1440.64s: would sleep in the afternoon so i'd go
1442.00s: up with him my wife would be at the
1443.44s: beach or the pool and i always have cnbc
1445.52s: honestly the dial is down a thousand
1446.96s: points a thousand every day and i was
1448.72s: like it was incredulous to just see the
1450.40s: market get smacked every day yeah so to
1453.04s: being 100 cash was a big advantage i was
1456.08s: already up in january and then full cash
1458.72s: and then right near the lows um
1461.52s: you know my understanding of monetary
1463.04s: policy the federal reserve i remember
1465.04s: was i think um it was i think a day off
1467.60s: the low and when the when the fed came
1469.04s: in and said you know we're bringing race
1470.48s: to zero we're doing qe we're making
1472.64s: reserve requirements zero i told my wife
1474.16s: it was a sunday night i said that's it
1475.36s: the bear market's over she's like come
1477.52s: on the world's shutting down around us
1478.96s: there's no bull market coming i said the
1480.72s: bear market is over that's what the
1481.92s: fed's doing and then
1483.52s: technically my technical tools triggered
1485.36s: a couple of days later because i'll
1486.48s: always wait for my tech and so it's like
1488.56s: i said you know it doesn't make any
1489.84s: sense the world is in a chaos but the
1492.32s: federal reserve is super accommodative
1494.40s: my tools are telling me it's a new bull
1495.84s: market
1496.80s: and i sat there and i told myself you
1499.60s: know what are the stocks that are going
1500.56s: to most benefit from the situation i
1502.00s: actually went back to like the 1914
1503.68s: world war one era
1505.20s: this is a health war and so i looked at
1506.96s: like the steel stocks from from you know
1508.72s: 1914 bethlehem steel as an example of
1511.44s: what to expect and i was able to key on
1513.68s: like some really stocks that would
1514.96s: really benefit for like levongo was for
1516.56s: health fastly was an internet uh
1518.80s: provider play
1520.48s: and matt you know the trade desk was a
1522.16s: digital advertising you know everything
1523.76s: that would benefit from being at home
1525.44s: and kind of like everything the strategy
1526.96s: really fell together and
1529.04s: it was like monster run so that was that
1531.04s: that's really it was really just a
1532.08s: matter of applying the strategy i didn't
1533.84s: do anything different or extra i didn't
1536.00s: some people think did you go extra
1537.44s: leverage like this is my
1539.44s: my livelihood i don't have a plan b so i
1541.84s: can't say that you know to win this
1542.88s: competition i'm gonna risk my uh my
1545.04s: family's uh you know uh money situation
1547.28s: you know so it was really just being
1548.40s: disciplined but you know also being
1550.40s: aggressive
1551.60s: right that that makes a ton of sense so
1554.56s: when like what were some of the
1556.56s: indicators that you saw that made you
1558.56s: make that transition to cash because i
1560.64s: think that obviously that was a
1562.88s: fantastic call
1564.64s: um but i am curious what led you to that
1568.32s: to that decision and kind of like when
1570.56s: when did that you know
1572.72s: when did those pieces line up that
1574.40s: you're like okay time to go to cash
1576.64s: so there's really three basic things
1578.72s: that i'll work with to go to cash uh one
1580.80s: is your own positions how they're acting
1582.40s: so
1583.12s: because i came into the year without any
1584.48s: positions i had like i had one really
1586.48s: good trade early in the year where i
1588.00s: think i i mean like brought my account
1589.44s: up 20 but i closed that out and then all
1591.60s: the new trades i initiated started to
1593.76s: break down okay and then but rather
1595.92s: initiate new trades um you know william
1598.32s: o'neill tracks what he called
1599.76s: distribution day so he looks at the
1601.04s: market index to see if there's you know
1603.20s: increased selling on down days to see if
1605.20s: there's a shift of what institutions are
1606.72s: doing and that was picking up at the
1609.12s: same time
1610.40s: i look at um yeah i don't want to get
1612.32s: too technical but uh each day there's a
1614.56s: number of stocks making new highs
1616.08s: 52-week highs a number of stocks making
1617.92s: new 52-week lows oh it's like evidence
1619.60s: decline or something like that yeah but
1621.44s: it's really yeah it's similar but if
1622.72s: you're looking at 52-week highs versus
1624.24s: also so when there's more stocks making
1626.64s: lows and highs that's a negative and if
1628.88s: you get three days in a row for me
1630.24s: that's that's a big negative and right
1631.76s: near the top
1632.96s: that's what that that's what was really
1634.32s: key about that market in 2020 is
1636.32s: everything started to break down like it
1638.16s: wasn't like oh you know this sector is a
1639.52s: little bit weak it was like no it's
1640.72s: across the board selling so that
1641.92s: crosstalk selling and my own you know
1644.40s: recent sellouts of my stocks was just
1646.48s: had me in cash i said there's no there's
1648.80s: no reason to be long and i was able to
1650.24s: just sit back and
1651.68s: and see the the carnage from the
1653.28s: sidelines and when you're trading during
1656.24s: this championship is are there
1657.84s: limitations on the products you can
1659.28s: trade or can you trade equities can you
1661.04s: trade derivatives or how does that work
1663.28s: so different categories i was in the
1664.96s: stock category so with stock only you
1666.88s: could use leverage margin but you know
1668.48s: standard whatever your broker you know
1670.16s: provides nothing
1671.44s: abnormal
1672.56s: and but only equity so i you know
1674.64s: there's no options no futures or
1675.92s: anything and then can you trade both
1678.08s: sides can you be long enough and okay
1680.24s: got it yeah so during the the covey drop
1683.20s: when you get that sort of indicator
1685.04s: that's like okay you know we're seeing
1687.52s: 52 week highs and lows and you know just
1689.52s: a breakdown between what you typically
1691.04s: look for there
1692.24s: um did you start saying and your
1694.64s: positions obviously like you're you know
1696.24s: citing where we're looking hurt other
1698.24s: than that one outlier that was
1699.76s: performing
1700.88s: um
1702.16s: did you say i'm gonna trade the short
1704.32s: side here or did you just say i'm gonna
1706.72s: wait and see how this thing pans out
1708.96s: you know to be honest i'm not a good
1710.56s: short side trader so i think i think we
1712.24s: have to all know like our strengths and
1713.36s: weaknesses like me either my first year
1715.12s: trading pros was 2008 so the financial
1717.12s: crisis
1718.16s: i i had a good year especially for a
1720.08s: first year novice like for pro trading i
1722.24s: think i treated the long side that
1724.08s: entire year yeah i just you know i was
1726.40s: always able to you know pick my
1727.44s: positions pick my spots you know short
1729.28s: term i did some shorting you know like
1731.28s: like i have my technical tools but i
1732.64s: don't personally feel comfortable i
1734.48s: think
1735.68s: the the main reason for me is it's
1738.56s: always appealed to me what's called the
1740.08s: asymmetry you know so
1741.76s: you know
1742.72s: on the upside you could have a five
1744.08s: percent loss is where you say look i'll
1745.84s: get out but i have a stock that can
1747.44s: potentially go up 50 100 200 on the
1749.84s: short side
1751.12s: what's great about the short side is it
1752.56s: happens fast so if you're right it's
1754.08s: like you know wow big profits quickly
1756.08s: but
1756.80s: a stock is gonna break down what ten
1758.64s: twenty thirty percent you knock it you
1759.92s: can't get a 300 drop the stock gets a
1761.84s: zero by then you know so so for me like
1764.32s: the risk reward i just prefer that long
1766.80s: side and i think
1768.08s: i'm an optimistic person by nature so i
1770.24s: like to always feel things will improve
1772.00s: and get better at some point so
1774.16s: i don't like living in that negative you
1776.00s: know world of trying to be short i'd
1777.52s: rather pick my points and try and get
1779.36s: long or be cash and just get ready for
1780.96s: the next you know up leg that's my
1782.88s: personality so if you play craps you pay
1785.12s: the pass line you don't play the don't
1786.40s: pass i don't know if you get craps but
1788.08s: that's you know what i've been trading
1789.28s: my whole life and unless besides a bit
1791.68s: of poker with friends to go somewhere
1793.12s: where i have a negative edge a negative
1794.48s: negative expectancy and put me on the
1795.76s: table it goes against everything i
1797.04s: believe in like
1798.24s: i want to be the casino i don't want to
1799.68s: play in the casino that's all i'm not a
1801.12s: big craps player that makes a ton of
1803.04s: sense yeah but yeah that's it's that's a
1805.68s: big thing in craps anyways is the the
1807.60s: pass line is what the whole table is
1809.76s: typically rooting for and they don't
1811.84s: pass typically is playing with the house
1814.80s: essentially okay okay um but yeah that
1817.12s: that's funny um
1819.68s: so
1820.96s: the
1821.68s: it's interesting that you say that
1823.04s: because
1824.00s: i actually i almost always have some
1826.80s: sort of short market deltas on but
1830.08s: they're always painted against a
1832.48s: generally long disposition portfolio
1835.44s: so it's it's interesting but for me if
1838.56s: i'm shorting something that's going to
1839.76s: be via like short calls i
1842.00s: have tried shorting stock a couple times
1844.48s: and i i don't like it i don't like
1847.76s: just the the carrying cost and then
1850.16s: sometimes i don't know it's probably
1851.60s: just because i'm relatively new to it
1854.00s: but the the liquidity part freaks me out
1856.56s: sometimes um you know if it starts to
1858.72s: dry up i'm just
1860.24s: so
1861.28s: i i tend to tend to avoid that um
1864.64s: okay so
1865.60s: it's funny what you mentioned though
1866.56s: because i remember once i was having a
1868.56s: discussion with one of the higher ups at
1870.00s: the bank and we were just you know just
1872.00s: talking back and forth and you were
1873.20s: talking about you know those those are
1874.40s: very small options trading a team much
1877.60s: smaller than the equities and i remember
1879.76s: asking you know i said you know how
1880.88s: they're performing well do i mean do you
1882.56s: like do you did you have a preference
1883.84s: yourself stocks you know options like
1885.44s: now he's like i'm more stock guy but we
1886.88s: like having the options guy they don't
1888.16s: do exceptionally great whenever there's
1890.24s: a really bad market or a steep decline
1892.48s: the options guys almost are always like
1894.08s: you know are always positioned to make
1896.00s: more money if the markets are dropping
1897.44s: you know for all the reasons of how
1898.80s: options are pricing you know the way
1900.16s: things have changed you know so it's
1901.68s: like it's all it's kind of like always a
1902.80s: good hedge to the equity division so
1904.16s: it's funny that you know the way you
1905.52s: think is really um typical of an options
1908.48s: trader i guess or someone with that dual
1910.80s: personality of options and equities that
1912.96s: and but that's exactly it is i'm sure
1915.04s: you've heard the saying but you know the
1916.40s: markets crash down not up so
1918.96s: it's always having something ready for
1920.64s: that crash down it's the to me
1922.96s: it's interesting because the
1924.96s: during the you know the bull market post
1927.12s: 08 that was a tough trade to keep on
1930.16s: because after a while you're like okay
1932.88s: 20
1934.80s: yeah it's like four years in a row
1936.00s: you're getting killed on this thing and
1937.36s: you're like
1938.40s: come on give me a payout here but when
1940.96s: it when it does hit it it typically is
1943.12s: is pretty nice
1944.56s: um
1945.44s: so
1946.16s: when the the market you know going back
1948.72s: to the covet drop
1950.48s: working capitulated you saw the stuff
1952.32s: come out with the fed obviously um big
1955.20s: daddy j-pal turned on his printer and
1957.12s: just let that thing go into overdrive
1959.04s: that's right um
1961.12s: so what kind of other than the fed's
1963.92s: statements
1965.04s: what technical tools were you looking at
1967.92s: that started making you comfortable with
1970.40s: like your re-entry postcode
1972.88s: so when the fed statement came out i
1974.96s: always use
1976.48s: the technical side to confirm my bigger
1978.88s: thoughts so i'm just a natural i guess
1980.96s: strategist so you know even when i was
1982.56s: even i was day trading i was always
1984.40s: reading like macro news or company news
1986.64s: but but you know i always use the
1988.48s: technicals to confirm whatever my
1990.00s: thoughts are because you can have this
1991.12s: great idea and to be totally wrong and
1993.68s: it's such a it could be such a a
1995.28s: well-argumented argument i mean if you
1997.92s: go online you read some stuff on
1999.04s: different websites and then say wow this
2000.64s: guy is
2001.60s: he's thought of everything and then he's
2002.72s: dead wrong you know so i find the market
2004.88s: will always surprise you so even though
2006.32s: all that came out by the fed
2008.16s: i was waiting for the follow-through day
2009.52s: which again william o'neill teaches in
2010.88s: his book
2011.92s: a very simple concept basically what he
2014.08s: looks for is you know the first two or
2015.68s: three days after market bottom you can't
2018.16s: really look at those to confirm a new
2019.60s: uptrend because that could be short
2020.72s: covering just people kind of saying i
2021.92s: gotta get out but starting on the fourth
2023.68s: day or later if you get a day where the
2025.60s: market's up like you know one and a
2026.88s: quarter one and a half percent or more
2028.56s: and with increasing volume that's a sign
2030.96s: that institutions are confident to come
2032.48s: back into the market and you may have
2033.76s: the beginning of a new bull market
2035.76s: so when i saw all that fed news i was
2038.00s: really waiting for that follow-through
2039.12s: day or net new highs to come out and
2040.96s: when i got the follow-through day at
2042.80s: that same time i saw all these great
2044.40s: setups and these again these stocks that
2046.08s: would benefit from stay at home and it
2047.44s: was like the perfect textbook setup and
2049.84s: that really is what allowed me to get in
2051.36s: there aggressively
2052.96s: and
2054.00s: just a personal question i have for you
2056.40s: out of curiosity you're in this
2058.32s: championship
2059.68s: you know markets going to hell you
2061.60s: decided to go to cash
2063.36s: how did that feel because i imagine
2065.60s: my mind would be racing like oh my you
2067.76s: know other people are shorting right now
2069.12s: you know other people are making money
2070.64s: or were you just more focused on this is
2073.28s: my real money so i'm gonna do what i
2075.44s: need to do to protect my real money
2077.44s: irrespective of you know the impact of
2079.44s: the championship here
2080.88s: yeah absolutely and
2082.72s: you know that brings up a really good
2083.92s: point though you know this whole this
2085.04s: whole idea of the championship and and
2086.96s: you know some people say they're trained
2088.24s: just for fun or i mean but the
2089.60s: championship was real money but
2090.88s: obviously i don't know other
2093.04s: participants to what degree they're
2094.40s: invested i mean the statements i'm
2096.00s: handing in are my company statements you
2097.68s: know i don't know what everyone else is
2098.88s: handing in you know there's a i think
2100.56s: the minimum is 20 000 or something i'm
2102.08s: not sure if there's just somewhat of a
2103.28s: minimum but um but that really goes back
2105.52s: to i think
2106.64s: people underestimate what it's like to
2108.24s: trade for a living you know for you when
2110.24s: i was at the bank especially now that i
2112.00s: trade my own capital
2113.60s: there are so many different pressures
2115.36s: that people don't realize because if you
2117.12s: have a full-time job and you have a
2118.40s: trading account nobody wants to lose
2119.92s: money but at the end of the day if you
2121.84s: mess up you're still going to be able to
2123.20s: eat that night you're still going to get
2124.24s: paid you know and for myself when i'm
2126.96s: trading for a living
2129.04s: you know the first of all there's a
2130.48s: higher tax rate because now this is your
2131.84s: income right so you have a higher tax
2133.12s: rate which is against you uh your
2134.88s: capital you can't use it for other
2136.24s: things in life you're using it for this
2137.60s: and if you go into drawdown
2139.36s: every time you go into drawdown that's
2140.72s: less buying power to make more money in
2142.32s: the future that impacts all your future
2143.76s: income
2144.56s: and and then on top of that you have
2145.84s: your living expenses that come out of
2147.36s: your trading so there's a lot of hurdles
2149.44s: and a lot of pressures
2151.04s: that you have trading for a living that
2152.72s: don't exist when you're trading
2153.84s: part-time so right so maybe just because
2156.48s: i'm used to that and so in the
2158.24s: championship you know it's just like
2160.16s: look this it's again discipline execute
2162.08s: your strategy even though other people
2163.60s: are doing whatever they're doing
2165.52s: you know be diligent be disciplined and
2167.76s: um because again i can't risk blowing up
2169.84s: everything just for a championship but
2171.36s: right there's really that a really big
2173.36s: difference between trading pro and
2174.88s: trading as a side business just like
2177.04s: drastically different on the mentality
2178.56s: and psychology yeah it makes a ton of
2180.88s: sense i was curious because
2183.04s: and it's i re it really resonated with
2185.20s: me when you started talking about some
2186.88s: of the impacts of the championship you
2188.96s: know just on your your mental
2191.76s: approach to the markets because like by
2194.00s: nature i i am just a hyper competitive
2196.64s: human being
2197.84s: so same here you know during the covid
2200.48s: drop for me
2202.24s: as a retail trader i literally couldn't
2204.88s: have cared less zero difference like i
2207.20s: you know i had some positions that were
2208.80s: hurting real bad i had other stuff that
2210.64s: was doing just fine and it was all
2212.48s: whatever because i knew if i needed to
2215.28s: roll and manage positions
2217.36s: sooner because i was mostly trading
2218.72s: index etfs i was trading like iwm
2221.04s: so
2221.76s: i didn't care right if i have to wait
2223.60s: three years for it to make a move and
2226.16s: whatever fine
2227.60s: but if i was in a championship
2230.08s: my mind would be racing it would be what
2232.64s: am i not doing that you know other
2234.32s: people are doing to take advantage of
2235.60s: this so i i actually think it's really
2237.76s: impressive you know that you're able to
2240.40s: balance the pressure of trading you know
2243.12s: for for your livelihood but then also
2245.68s: keeping keeping really your priorities
2247.52s: in place despite that competitive
2249.84s: environment that's that's really
2250.96s: impressive but i think that also
2252.24s: highlights
2253.36s: a really important skill set that you've
2255.36s: developed over time as a trader right
2257.20s: which is to be less mentally perturbed
2259.76s: by the market moves and staying
2261.52s: disciplined so it's it's an interesting
2263.84s: yeah it's an interesting culmination of
2265.44s: that you know i think it's really it's
2267.20s: really interesting that all the traders
2268.64s: i know like the guys i traded with or
2270.48s: even other that i've met through you
2272.16s: know online and stuff
2273.76s: people who trade for a living or have
2275.60s: traded let's say even if you don't trade
2276.96s: for a living but you've traded
2277.76s: aggressively for many many years
2280.80s: it's funny we can't tend to have a lot
2282.88s: of similarities in how we view the world
2284.72s: how we think sure um even in politics
2287.84s: very similar views like it and it's like
2289.92s: really strange like you really become
2291.44s: this subset i think it's um the market
2294.08s: kind of
2294.96s: forced you to be a very independent
2296.48s: person self-reliant confident
2299.68s: you have to
2301.12s: read between the lines you need a new
2302.64s: statement comes out what is that person
2304.16s: really trying to say you know or is it
2305.84s: the ceo trying to make a bad situation
2307.68s: look good you have to be resourceful you
2309.84s: know you only have so many funds you got
2311.20s: to make these work you know you know
2312.40s: what are your costs how do i grow this
2314.32s: so it i mean i think that's why even
2316.32s: yourself as a as a marine you know it's
2319.04s: these are these are the things they're
2320.16s: trying to instill with you and i always
2321.84s: i always compare
2323.84s: the markets with uh battle with war i
2326.32s: mean the book the battle for investment
2328.56s: survival by uh gerald loeb which is one
2330.56s: of the classics
2332.56s: i find that's probably the best title
2334.48s: book of any book because it's like you
2336.96s: know for investment it's really a battle
2338.32s: for for investment survival the market's
2340.24s: a hard place i mean if you're going to
2341.36s: buy stocks all this for retirement 40
2343.36s: years out i'm buying a t okay you'll do
2345.84s: it right i mean but that's
2347.36s: that's not active investing if you
2349.04s: really want like that's not a business
2350.64s: that's the same like buying a condo and
2352.48s: renting it out you're not you can't say
2354.16s: you're running a real estate company you
2355.52s: know what i mean so
2356.80s: so you know
2358.48s: so most traders that psychology what it
2360.32s: builds into you because of the the
2362.16s: adversity and and you know there's
2364.40s: months where the market's hurting you
2365.92s: and you have to get the confidence to
2367.28s: come back and it really creates a
2369.60s: specific unique set of still skills
2371.76s: mindset that um
2373.92s: i think now i was you know talking with
2376.08s: my wife and some friends and with all
2377.52s: this covet stuff and so many people are
2379.52s: down and they're having a hard time
2381.52s: and and you start to realize when you're
2383.20s: through always dealing with your day job
2385.36s: where there's an adversary kind of like
2387.20s: attacking you all the time you kind of
2389.28s: become almost numb to it it's part of
2391.04s: life and i got to get over this and it's
2392.48s: just another hurdle to success but then
2394.64s: you know you kind of realize that that's
2396.40s: not normal for most people that's not
2398.40s: that's not that's not most people's
2400.32s: day-to-day life you know they have a
2402.00s: nice job and and that's great it's just
2403.52s: a choice of livelihood but the skill
2406.08s: sets that that we develop as active
2408.08s: investors is a and i think it makes you
2410.96s: um a very strong uh independent a
2413.92s: confident human being so if you can get
2415.68s: through all the adversity much like i'm
2417.60s: sure like if you can get through marine
2418.72s: boot camp you come out the other side a
2420.88s: different person a stronger person you
2422.40s: know so that's i think that's something
2423.52s: that that's a life skill that you get
2426.00s: that you won't you don't even know that
2427.52s: you're gonna get by getting into this
2429.44s: i think that that's a huge point and i
2431.44s: think that another thing that i would
2433.44s: add on that i find that most traders
2435.76s: identify very closely with not always
2438.32s: the same approach but
2440.40s: the way that we perceive and assess risk
2443.76s: is very different than most other
2446.00s: categories that i see
2447.84s: and i find that to be useful just in
2450.16s: general life right i mean even using
2452.24s: covet as an example you know you there's
2454.48s: different perceptions of the risk
2456.72s: and the way that we mitigate the risk
2458.88s: and i think trading at least for most of
2461.44s: the traders that i've
2462.96s: had the the pleasure of talking with in
2465.44s: terms of approach
2467.12s: risk assessment is always something
2469.20s: that's top of mind it's not always you
2471.68s: know a huge concern but definitely top
2474.24s: of mind and then the other thing that
2476.16s: that you were saying that really
2477.28s: resonated with me was just
2479.36s: the the concept i haven't met a
2482.00s: successful trader that's been in the
2483.36s: business for longer a decade that isn't
2485.44s: disciplined i haven't found one i found
2488.16s: a couple that were really lucky early on
2490.96s: and then they stopped which you can
2492.48s: consider that discipline of some sort
2494.56s: but you know i've met some people like
2496.56s: that that just hit a good bankroll early
2499.12s: on and then switch to long-term
2500.96s: investing and you know let that sit but
2503.04s: i haven't met an active trader that's
2505.28s: been at it longer a decade that hasn't
2507.04s: learned discipline and the ability to
2509.44s: follow to follow a plan
2511.60s: um
2512.40s: so something i'm curious about with you
2514.64s: is
2516.40s: you were talking
2517.76s: a bit about institutions driving trends
2520.72s: this is a little bit of a nuanced
2522.08s: question but i'm just curious your take
2523.44s: on it
2524.32s: um what do you think about dark pools
2528.64s: well in what sense what i mean i'm
2530.48s: curious
2531.52s: so
2532.72s: to just give you know for the for
2534.40s: anybody that's listening that may not be
2536.64s: familiar essentially dark pools are a
2539.04s: way
2539.84s: for large institutions to send block
2542.16s: trades through right um and obviously
2544.80s: they'll have a pretty significant impact
2546.96s: if they were traded on the open market
2548.40s: may not be able to get a full fill
2550.00s: prices be all over the place all that
2551.12s: kind of stuff but one of the the main
2553.44s: benefits to dark pool is a little bit of
2555.68s: obscurity and you know movement
2558.48s: and i'm curious when you're going
2561.52s: through using institutions it seems
2563.84s: institutional volume is like part of
2565.52s: your information data gathering to make
2567.44s: decisions off of
2568.88s: how do do dark pools you know factor
2571.36s: into that at all or since they're not
2572.88s: traded on the open market are they
2575.28s: things that exist you know they exist
2577.20s: but they don't necessarily impact your
2579.28s: deployment as a trader
2581.28s: for myself personally i don't think it
2582.88s: really impacts what i'm doing that
2584.48s: that's really i think the biggest impact
2586.16s: there is if you're a very short-term
2588.16s: trader like well what i was doing
2590.24s: market making pro trading there's more
2592.08s: of an impact significant gotta but you
2594.48s: know most institutions they're gonna cut
2596.00s: up their orders they're never gonna go
2597.20s: to one venue you know so dark pools is
2599.12s: gonna be one venue they're gonna go to
2600.96s: and look i mean i don't have the stats
2602.88s: behind me to go over all this but like
2604.40s: you know basically
2605.76s: let's say they even they send 20 to dark
2608.00s: pools that's probably gonna be like
2609.20s: across the board going to be a
2610.24s: consistent number so
2612.16s: you know the majority of the volume is
2613.68s: still going to trade on the open markets
2615.44s: and
2616.48s: at the end of the day is that demand and
2617.68s: supply you know in fact if the sellers
2619.20s: are being absorbed by these big buyers
2620.72s: that's going to come through in price
2622.00s: and volume and i'm looking more for you
2624.32s: know
2625.28s: trends that last you know several weeks
2626.96s: at least two months and so that very
2629.52s: small nuance is not going to really hide
2631.28s: the fact if you're if you're the
2632.72s: fidelity contra fund you're 130 billion
2634.80s: dollar fund you want to have one percent
2636.24s: of your portfolio in a stock that's 1.3
2638.88s: billion dollars and the market cap on
2640.88s: that portfolio is 20 billion dollars
2642.24s: that's you need to buy five percent of
2643.44s: that company the fact that there's dark
2645.36s: pools or not is not going to impact that
2647.52s: you know it's not going to stop the
2648.96s: impact that you're going to have on that
2649.92s: stock price
2651.44s: yeah that makes a ton of sense and that
2652.80s: leads me to my follow-on question and
2654.96s: you've answered some of it but i'm
2656.24s: curious you know uh a more specific
2658.56s: answer so like
2659.76s: obviously that time frame impact is
2662.24s: different what time frame are you
2664.16s: normally looking at if there is a normal
2666.40s: for you or does it vary widely and if so
2668.56s: what does that range look like
2670.24s: so i mean if i get into a stock and if
2672.16s: it falls tomorrow it gets me out i'll be
2674.00s: out tomorrow but my holding period my
2676.40s: aim is going to be
2678.40s: at least four to six weeks up to nine
2680.48s: months or so that's that's what i'm
2682.16s: looking to you know if the trade is
2683.60s: successful
2684.72s: it's gonna be six to nine months if it's
2686.00s: a real rocket trade if it's
2687.84s: uh mediocre and i'm taking my profits
2689.84s: because it's not going to be the big
2691.36s: move that i was expecting i'm probably
2692.80s: in it for four or five weeks and i'm
2694.56s: taking my profit so that's kind of the
2696.80s: the two sides of what i'm i'm probably
2698.40s: doing typically got it okay and to start
2701.28s: with just the the risk understanding
2703.52s: first when you find a stock that you're
2705.44s: interested in
2706.64s: what is your general approach to
2709.04s: deciding how you're going to manage risk
2710.64s: in it
2711.84s: so the way i've developed my strategy
2713.68s: over the years the way i deploy my risk
2715.84s: now is every trade has the same risk all
2718.24s: the time my position sizing is standard
2720.64s: uh regarding regardless of the chart or
2722.32s: the volatility i have a fixed maximum
2724.88s: loss that i'll take that's a fixed
2726.64s: amount of my account and i'll build my
2729.12s: position over time so that that's also a
2731.36s: way for me to avoid gap down risk so
2734.40s: let's say i want to have i you know i'm
2736.00s: a concentrated guy i'm an aggressive guy
2737.60s: if i have a third of my account in a
2738.96s: stock i don't want to do that day one
2740.72s: because if i if i do a day one and they
2742.48s: announce uh you know we expect sales
2744.56s: that you know sometimes there's an early
2746.00s: announcement sales are going to be a
2746.88s: little lower than we expected we open
2748.08s: down 20 i'm going to get hit pretty hard
2750.24s: so if i want to get that 30 exposure on
2753.12s: the stock i'll do it over a number of
2755.20s: days or a couple of weeks so that it's
2756.96s: going my way and i have some profit
2758.48s: cushion to buffer my initial capital at
2760.72s: risk
2761.92s: but but even as i do that my my maximum
2764.56s: risk will stay the same so i end up
2765.92s: using kind of open profits to finance
2768.48s: additional risk
2770.16s: got it so when you're looking at that's
2774.08s: an interesting perspective so
2776.08s: the if the position side is is generally
2778.80s: standard you know again regardless of
2780.88s: the product are you using i assume then
2783.60s: just like a percentage of the position
2785.12s: size as your max risk in that position
2787.68s: so it's i just think like kind of unique
2789.68s: that i for me that i've never seen
2791.60s: anyone's do
2793.12s: is i call i call the crucial dollar stop
2795.12s: so basically i i said gotta name it i
2797.76s: love that name i gotta name it you know
2799.28s: it's so funny i i created like an
2801.12s: investing course and there's all the
2802.64s: stuff i've been doing for years and and
2804.32s: you know when you're teaching someone
2805.28s: you got to name these things right
2807.12s: i'm just horrible like if you look at
2808.32s: some of the names
2809.36s: i choose it's just like literally like
2810.64s: what i think of it you know like i see
2812.24s: people have these you know my voodoo
2813.76s: tool and the xyz you know i like i have
2816.72s: the worst things possible anyways i like
2819.28s: that one
2820.24s: yeah yeah i guess you know i'm sure it's
2821.68s: out there somewhere but yeah so
2823.52s: basically my initial position will be a
2825.76s: percentage of my account but you know
2827.52s: i'll put in dollar terms day to day so
2829.12s: it's easier to deal with so because you
2830.56s: know if i buy in the stock falls x
2832.24s: number of dollars
2833.36s: instead of calculating a percentage got
2835.28s: it but as i add to that position
2837.68s: that initial dollar stop doesn't get
2839.68s: bigger just because the position gets
2841.04s: bigger
2841.92s: that's a way for me to
2844.16s: build a position size but never risk
2846.16s: more uh than what i initially risked
2849.52s: got it
2850.48s: and
2851.68s: how do you balance
2853.60s: you know giving the the position a
2855.84s: little bit of room to move um so that
2858.16s: you're not prematurely stopped out with
2860.24s: controlling your risk like what's your
2861.44s: mindset with that
2863.12s: yeah and so uh that's a good point so
2865.20s: whenever i make a purchase i usually
2866.88s: wait for it to advance at least about
2868.16s: five percent you know so okay a lot of
2870.00s: the stocks i deal with you know this
2871.76s: will probably be different if you're
2872.72s: dealing with a utility stock or you're
2874.24s: dealing with a
2875.44s: i don't know a penny stock you know
2877.04s: which have really different on the two
2879.28s: extremes in terms of volatility but you
2881.52s: know for most of the growth stocks i
2882.96s: deal with i i just through i guess
2884.48s: experience that i've worked with once it
2886.48s: advances five percent or more if you get
2888.56s: another good buy signal
2890.24s: i have enough breathing space for normal
2891.92s: volatility if i add to that position i
2894.00s: just notice i used to get in trouble
2895.20s: sometimes where i'd buy a stock and go
2897.36s: up you know one one and a half percent
2898.80s: pause and i got another buy point and
2900.64s: you know okay i'll buy some more so
2901.84s: basically i'm building this big position
2903.36s: all within a one or two percent range so
2905.12s: here by the time right by the time i put
2907.28s: on a full position it's probably
2908.80s: advanced 10 from my original purchase so
2912.16s: all of that that gain and my initial low
2914.80s: cost buys give me a lot of breathing
2916.80s: room for normal volatility if the stock
2918.32s: dropped 20
2919.44s: i'm stopped but that's not a normal
2920.96s: downside move for a stock that's in a
2922.96s: bull market you know so right okay
2925.44s: and then when you're deciding for me i
2928.48s: always term it scaling in that's
2930.24s: actually a big part of my general
2931.68s: approach too is like i i
2933.92s: come up i call it like a trade
2935.36s: allocation however much money i'm gonna
2937.20s: put into a specific trade and then i
2939.28s: come up with scaling rules so my initial
2941.52s: outlay will be x percent of that total
2943.76s: amount of money and then you know
2944.96s: initial skills from there which is hard
2947.12s: for a lot of people i mean like we have
2948.64s: a same mindset yeah for most people who
2950.88s: come to the market
2952.40s: and i've noticed as i've you know
2954.08s: interact with more people is that you
2955.52s: know they have a hard time thinking that
2956.96s: way for them it's like i buy and when do
2958.48s: i take my profit to think that you're
2960.16s: adding to a stock that you're making
2961.60s: money on is um a unique mindset that
2964.56s: people have to get used to typically
2966.32s: yeah yeah oh absolutely and sometimes
2968.40s: it's even difficult you know if you get
2970.24s: a big move in your direction and then
2971.92s: you're like
2973.12s: you now what do i just take this profit
2975.52s: and walk away or but anyways i'm curious
2978.72s: when you're deciding to scale
2981.20s: um into our you know let's say if the
2984.08s: position's moving in your favor um when
2986.64s: like how do you approach scaling what's
2988.16s: your thought process there
2990.48s: so this whole part of it becomes uh
2992.40s: really my technical analysis base you
2994.88s: know so i i always try and start my
2997.68s: positions when the stock is making a
2999.36s: larger base
3000.96s: and what i like to do though is all the
3002.72s: the swing trading tools that the
3004.16s: technical tools that i use for my years
3006.00s: of you know being a market maker and pro
3007.52s: trader which are so short term
3009.28s: i use a number of those tools to keep
3011.28s: adding as a stock is breaking out in my
3013.52s: direction so i kind of i kind of bring a
3016.16s: larger base structure but i time that
3018.96s: with smaller type of trading patterns
3021.28s: and
3022.16s: i got to that point because at one point
3023.68s: i remember
3024.64s: i was i think i forgot what it was like
3026.56s: i had made a couple of buys you know
3028.00s: because i you know i always ran two
3029.36s: strategies my short-term strategies and
3031.12s: my growth portfolio and it's very
3032.80s: different kind of logic
3034.72s: and i remember like i take a couple of
3036.56s: losing positions on my growth portfolio
3038.72s: and it's like i knew when i was putting
3040.24s: them on like from a short term basis i i
3042.48s: wouldn't be doing this if it was my
3043.68s: short so i had these two sides of my
3045.44s: brain so i said you know if institutions
3047.12s: and i see these guys coming in buying
3048.72s: every day for three months if they can
3050.64s: buy every day why do i feel just because
3052.96s: i'm using this strategy i have to
3054.08s: blindly follow it as i learned it why
3055.76s: can't i adapt it to all the other tools
3057.44s: that i learned that i know work short
3058.80s: term because
3059.92s: sometimes i was being stopped out
3061.92s: because of a bad short term entry but
3063.60s: the longer term idea was correct so i
3065.20s: said look one of my skills that i've
3066.96s: fortunately developed is a great
3068.56s: short-term entry pattern so i that's how
3070.96s: i kind of at one point said like you
3072.96s: know duh why don't we like join all the
3075.04s: skills that we have instead of keeping
3076.40s: them separated
3077.76s: i love that i literally love that that's
3080.00s: so one of my favorite strategies that i
3081.84s: use it's kind of like a
3085.60s: it's a bit of an abomination but it's
3088.32s: like uh in options we have diagonals so
3091.20s: a big strategy that my mentor liked to
3093.04s: use was leap diagonals then we you know
3095.04s: add a ratio to it
3096.80s: but long story short on the strategy it
3099.52s: really
3100.64s: capitalizes on a lot of that where the
3103.28s: entire base of the trade is typically
3105.52s: over a year in terms of you know
3108.40s: assessment thinking you know from here
3110.24s: to here we're expecting it to go up or
3111.76s: down over the course of a year
3113.60s: but there's a short-term component to
3115.60s: that trade it's one of my favorite
3116.64s: trades
3117.52s: and it's you know it's designed exactly
3120.32s: you know kind of like you're you're
3121.76s: explaining your approaches which is
3123.04s: interesting to hear that with like an
3124.88s: equities base i'm i'm fascinated by that
3128.16s: so
3129.68s: thinking and just being mindful of of
3132.08s: your time um but i i would be remiss if
3134.80s: i didn't ask a couple questions about
3136.24s: just your general technical approach so
3138.48s: when you think about you know that some
3140.56s: of the stocks you're looking at do you
3142.48s: typically arrive at your stock picks by
3146.56s: looking at your portfolio and saying uh
3149.12s: you know i need to fill this gap
3151.04s: whatever you know that risk app looks
3152.72s: like if you want a specific product or
3154.80s: are you generally looking at the market
3157.04s: and just saying well this looks
3158.72s: interesting to me or this looks like an
3160.24s: opportunity do you start at the
3161.68s: portfolio or do you typically start by
3163.60s: looking at the market and seeing what
3165.44s: opportunities are there
3167.52s: so portfolio-wise obviously i'm a trader
3169.36s: so i always want to be like 200 invested
3171.68s: right but so it's i have to always hold
3173.44s: myself back so i i usually use the
3175.52s: market in general uh like the way i look
3178.24s: at new highs new lows to kind of gauge
3180.08s: my exposure i have some rules for you
3181.84s: know should i be fully invested should i
3183.60s: should i have 30 cash or should i be at
3185.68s: least 70 cash so i have kind of a
3187.84s: technical gauge just to keep me uh on
3190.24s: the road instead of being too off of
3191.76s: what the market's telling me but that's
3193.76s: kind of like my big picture idea but
3195.84s: typically what i do is i run a lot of
3197.84s: scans to find which stocks have the
3199.76s: biggest growth numbers fundamentally
3202.08s: that of those i want to see which are
3203.68s: performing the best technically and then
3205.52s: the market's telling you the story right
3206.88s: so for example let's say
3208.48s: um
3209.68s: i don't know let's think of a company
3210.88s: like or let's go back to we were talking
3212.32s: 2020. you know like this company lavongo
3214.56s: has 200 earnings growth and it's 5 from
3218.08s: its 52-week high well okay something's
3220.32s: going on the company's obviously doing
3222.08s: it fantastically fundamentally the
3224.08s: market's recognizing that because it's
3225.76s: paying up it's at its 52 week highs what
3228.08s: is going on so then that's where i like
3229.84s: to dive into the story of the company
3231.36s: you can go to investor relations website
3232.88s: ceo read online and okay this is what
3235.52s: they're doing and when you do that
3236.96s: enough times eventually you know no
3239.36s: company is like an island you know if
3241.76s: someone's gonna do something it's
3242.88s: usually just a slightly better iteration
3244.80s: of something else someone's already done
3246.16s: and then it's a matter of implementing
3247.44s: so when you do this with company after
3249.20s: company after company you kind of say
3250.80s: like oh okay that's the trend they're
3252.00s: working on and so then after once once
3253.76s: you see that you start to build a
3255.04s: picture of will this scale who else is
3257.12s: going to benefit and
3258.64s: once you build that idea and then after
3260.32s: these other companies that you thought
3261.44s: would have benefited start coming in oh
3262.96s: now they have huge monster growth and
3264.80s: they're sitting at 52 week highs okay so
3266.88s: i guess that trend of different so it's
3268.16s: you want to have
3269.52s: an idea that you build with a
3270.80s: fundamental basis but then you want to
3272.24s: have okay the market's recognizing it
3273.92s: the funds are paying up for it how do i
3275.84s: get on board with a good low situation
3277.84s: and that's kind of how i bring it
3279.36s: together i love that that's that's
3281.92s: really a fascinating perspective
3283.76s: especially i think most of when i
3286.56s: venture into individual stocks
3289.44s: i almost always start with fundamentals
3292.32s: just to make sure if it's something that
3294.08s: i get stuck in for a little longer than
3295.60s: expected because again for me if i if i
3297.28s: have to hold on to something for three
3298.48s: years i i really don't care i'll do it
3300.72s: you know it is what it is i'll figure it
3302.72s: out not for me if i can't use my money
3304.48s: i'm dead so it's gonna work or it's
3306.24s: gotta go yeah
3308.40s: um
3309.28s: so when you're looking at fundamentals
3312.08s: it sounds like
3313.52s: you're looking at kind of a very i don't
3316.16s: wanna say stereotypical but like just
3317.84s: common common concepts like making sure
3320.24s: that we're generating you know cash is
3322.96s: somehow you know via earnings per share
3325.52s: metrics or you know revenue whatever
3328.32s: just some sort of valuation metrics
3330.00s: there
3330.80s: are there any other like really
3332.96s: fundamental tools that you like to
3335.12s: integrate when you're looking at these
3336.32s: stocks
3337.84s: i think
3339.28s: you know if you boil it down and you
3340.88s: know you can go into academic papers and
3343.20s: people can argue this more that way but
3344.96s: but you know earnings are what investors
3347.36s: are going to pay for and even if it's
3348.96s: not current earnings it's future
3350.32s: earnings for example amazon for years
3352.00s: everyone argued like oh but they're
3353.04s: barely making any money well at that
3354.80s: time investors believe though they spoke
3357.44s: they heard the message from bazel so
3358.96s: they said okay you don't have great
3360.56s: earnings now but we we believe you
3362.72s: enough you're executing enough on
3364.16s: different variables that we're going to
3365.28s: put that faith in you so
3367.04s: typically the earnings will be present
3368.72s: they'll be booming the rare exception
3370.80s: that won't be the case but then at least
3372.16s: sales are going to be booming right so i
3373.68s: mean
3374.32s: you could say i'll postpone earnings but
3375.84s: you better be at least selling the
3377.20s: product and you're gonna get the
3378.00s: earnings later when when you could when
3379.28s: you have more pricing power or whatever
3380.72s: it is you know so those are the two
3382.40s: factors i look at either you know record
3384.24s: earnings or at least the highest
3385.60s: earnings of the past eight or ten years
3387.12s: or at least record sales or the you know
3389.12s: the highest sales of the past eight to
3390.48s: ten years but growing aggressively now
3392.40s: if you look at a company where this is
3394.32s: well let's assume it's a younger company
3396.16s: those usually have the best uh growth
3398.08s: stories
3399.28s: if this is the most money as a company
3401.12s: you ever made and you're gonna grow by
3403.28s: another 50 next year and your sales have
3405.60s: been up quarter after quarter 40 percent
3408.08s: you are doing something right now
3410.96s: if
3411.92s: if if you know the economy doesn't fall
3413.84s: apart or or if you don't make a a big
3415.92s: mistake you know as a company and you
3417.36s: pivot the wrong way
3419.04s: you are selling a product that your
3420.72s: customers love and you're doing it well
3423.12s: so if you can continue executing like
3424.88s: that you're going to keep those earnings
3426.56s: growing and that's the best candidate to
3428.88s: have huge upside this is where the
3430.40s: asymmetry comes in if you can find
3432.40s: companies that are doing that and if
3434.24s: you're growing aggressively your stock
3435.92s: price is going to advance aggressively
3437.12s: so your upside is huge because if you
3439.36s: compound earnings growth of 30 percent
3441.36s: over four or five years and institutions
3443.44s: pay up you're gonna get hundreds of
3444.48s: percent return but if you're wrong and
3446.64s: you're disciplined you're gonna lose
3448.64s: what three four percent of your of your
3450.80s: trade so it gives you the chance to find
3452.72s: a stock that has this huge runway that
3454.80s: you can potentially
3456.24s: really significantly you know build with
3457.92s: position building like we mentioned
3458.96s: scale into size and if you're right you
3461.52s: have this massive upside but if you're
3463.52s: wrong okay i lost i lost what i was
3465.28s: willing to lose for this trade i can
3466.48s: move on so that asymmetrical setup you
3469.04s: could be wrong at the end of the year
3470.40s: you could be wrong seven out of ten
3472.08s: times and have a great year right so
3474.40s: it's just a different which when i was
3476.32s: day trading it was the opposite i
3478.08s: probably had you know a success ratio
3479.84s: north of 50 but right gains were small
3481.84s: wins were small so
3483.44s: there's not a one perfect way to trade
3485.28s: but that's this is the strategy i'm
3486.64s: using now and that's the logic behind it
3488.48s: i think for most retail investors
3490.88s: that's you know
3492.56s: the best way to approach the market
3493.92s: because that asymmetry is huge and you
3496.96s: you catch one nvidia or apple and you're
3499.36s: retired you know it's
3502.32s: it's interesting so many thoughts coming
3504.40s: to my mind when you say that because i
3506.08s: feel like
3507.20s: for most retail traders lower risk high
3510.56s: return is very appealing which is you
3513.36s: know a version of you know what you're
3515.20s: discussing we essentially want to
3516.32s: control risk to the downside fairly
3517.84s: tightly but give ourselves runway to the
3519.52s: to the to the upside
3521.12s: but i always feel like retail traders
3524.24s:  it up for themselves because when
3526.48s: you look at like the behavior of even
3529.36s: there's a couple white papers that i
3530.80s: really like one of them is individual
3532.56s: investor behavior and it was by the
3535.44s: university of california berkeley and
3538.56s: it talked about the propensity for
3540.48s: retail traders to let losers run
3543.60s: and cut winners short literally they
3546.16s: have the idea that you do but they don't
3548.72s: have the discipline to make it happen
3552.00s: what was
3553.28s: i don't know your approach to allow i
3555.68s: always feel like cutting losers you know
3558.16s: it's it's difficult but once you get
3559.92s: used to it it is what it is it's part of
3561.60s: the business but i find when i talk to
3564.56s: people one of the more difficult
3566.08s: components when we once we get the risk
3567.76s: under control is letting winners move
3571.36s: how do you arrive at that like what's
3573.12s: your approach to letting some of these
3575.36s: trades run you know 30 50 100 you know
3579.44s: whatever you're seeing how do you you
3581.36s: know force yourself to keep your hands
3582.88s: out of it and say nope i'm gonna let
3584.32s: this run um this is my strategy
3587.36s: and it's hard because for example in
3588.88s: 2020 levongo was my best my best trade
3591.52s: and that was up about 400 percent so
3593.36s: when you're already up 100
3594.80s: to let it ride and you have 200 it's
3596.64s: very hard but you know i was
3599.12s: and and this concept you bring up is as
3601.52s: old as investing is because if you if
3604.16s: you read the book reminiscence of the
3605.44s: stock operator i don't know if you ever
3606.64s: read that book jesse livermore that's
3609.28s: written in 1927. and he's saying that
3611.44s: you know men should should fear when
3613.20s: they hope and they should hope when they
3614.40s: fear which is yeah people do the because
3615.92s: i think it's just that human nature
3617.84s: of it's gonna come back and when you're
3619.60s: making money oh no i'm scared i'm gonna
3620.96s: lose my profit it's just this weird
3622.32s: psychological pro uh you know block that
3624.72s: almost most people have
3626.32s: yeah and another another part of it is
3628.56s: that people don't like to be wrong so
3630.88s: if you're making money and you take your
3632.16s: profits you're right if you're losing
3633.68s: money but i don't sell you're not yet
3635.92s: wrong you are wrong the mark your broker
3637.92s: will tell you wrong the money is no
3638.96s: longer there but you can feel like
3640.40s: you're not wrong right so i think i'm
3643.04s: very very very fortunate that the first
3645.28s: book that appealed to me was how to make
3646.56s: money in stocks by william o'neill
3647.84s: because he really explained it in such a
3650.16s: way that it made so much sense to me
3652.08s: logically from day one that that
3654.64s: it became part of my dna as a trader and
3656.56s: that's probably why you know you look at
3658.08s: most traders even professionals a lot of
3659.68s: them had a period where they blew up i
3661.20s: never blew up because i never broke the
3663.12s: cardinal rule of limiting risk and he
3665.68s: just really made it he made it he made
3667.12s: it sound so simple i think he was a
3669.28s: was it the dress story i think he told
3670.80s: he's like let's say you're a businessman
3671.84s: and you have you buy red and yellow
3673.36s: dresses
3674.48s: and the yellow dresses are not selling
3676.00s: and the red dress is you're sold out
3677.92s: well what are you gonna do you can
3678.96s: discount the yellow dress just to get
3680.24s: rid of it and you take that money and
3681.84s: you're gonna buy some more red dresses
3683.76s: and i just said you know i don't know
3685.52s: they just just clicked with me i said
3686.72s: like yeah the stock's not trading
3687.84s: they're just there's something wrong
3688.72s: with it take it out and right
3690.40s: approach it like a businessman rather
3692.00s: than
3692.96s: a gambler let's say come on you gotta
3694.56s: come back like
3695.76s: people
3696.64s: because it's buying and selling and
3698.72s: numbers are flashing it has that
3700.32s: gambling component of course
3702.48s: yeah and and it's very easy that the
3704.64s: line is very fine it's more about how
3706.32s: you treat it than what it is whether
3707.68s: it's gambling or investing or a business
3710.00s: totally but if if logically you could
3712.48s: approach it like a business person
3714.64s: then it totally makes sense to hey
3716.56s: what's not working get rid of it and
3718.32s: start focusing on what's working because
3719.92s: any business person in any business ever
3721.92s: that was successful focused on what was
3724.24s: executing in the company and getting rid
3725.76s: of what wasn't so i think if you just
3727.76s: look at it from that perspective and you
3729.84s: really internalize that idea in your
3731.76s: mind
3732.72s: you won't you won't be hoping anymore so
3734.72s: you'll just again that just resonated
3737.12s: with me from day one so yeah i had that
3739.28s: out of me and some people are gonna have
3740.80s: to work through that psychologically but
3742.72s: once you get that inside you and inside
3744.64s: your mindset it's gonna it's for me it's
3747.04s: impossible to go the other way i just i
3748.80s: can't sit when i see a stock turn red
3750.88s: and i'm bleeding money it like itches me
3753.04s: to get rid of it and more is the
3754.88s: opposite so i think it's just a mindset
3756.40s: you have to build that's awesome yeah
3758.56s: that that's just a really powerful story
3760.72s: and i and i really like that analogy
3762.48s: because i am one of those idiot traders
3765.84s: that at one point had to go through that
3767.76s: uh you know phoenix from the ashes bit
3770.16s: where
3771.04s: nearly nearly imploded but i'm
3773.68s: you are a very rare exception to that
3776.08s: and it's actually really awesome to hear
3777.52s: how you're able to do that that's pretty
3779.44s: that's pretty impressive to me
3781.36s: um
3782.56s: okay so i have one other question again
3784.48s: i i don't want to take up too much of
3785.92s: your time i really appreciate chatting
3787.36s: with you um
3789.12s: 2022
3790.40s: yeah hell of a year coming up um
3792.80s: especially here in the us you know we're
3794.80s: talking about three to four interest
3796.88s: rate rises one of them starting as early
3798.96s: as march they're talking about easing
3801.04s: the quantitative easing bond but all
3802.64s: these sorts of things
3804.08s: i am really curious just what your
3807.12s: general hypothesis is
3809.68s: for the markets you know heading into
3812.00s: 2022 obviously
3814.40s: just basing the discussion on what we
3816.08s: know right now which is what 18 jan and
3819.44s: everything is subject to change based on
3821.04s: new information all that stuff a lot of
3822.88s: people get really wrapped around the
3824.08s: axle when somebody's like well you said
3825.60s: this and it's like yeah i said that
3827.28s: three weeks ago changes like
3829.76s: stay with the times here you know i'm
3831.44s: not an analyst i'm an investor trader so
3833.60s: if i said something you know
3835.36s: what's the saying you know like uh i
3837.20s: can't remember now i'm trying to think
3838.40s: um
3839.68s: i you know i have very strong opinions
3841.28s: very weakly held you know what i mean so
3842.72s: like when i'm on something yeah yeah
3844.40s: when i'm really on to something like i'm
3845.84s: gonna be in there i'll position my
3846.88s: account but it doesn't work like oh
3848.08s: maybe i'm wrong and i think right
3849.44s: flexibility is important you know yeah
3851.52s: so i i agree you know so what my outlook
3854.32s: if i'm reading the you know the market
3856.24s: as i see it now the federal reserve
3858.64s: wanting to raise rates is the elephant
3860.72s: in the room the federal reserve is
3861.92s: always the elephant actually yeah but
3864.00s: you know but the thing is there's it's
3866.16s: rare that the federal reserve is making
3867.52s: big moves so 2020 forced their hand and
3869.84s: now inflation is forcing their hand
3871.20s: again usually in the in the meantime
3872.96s: between major tightening or losing
3874.72s: policies
3875.76s: you kind of don't hear from them very
3876.80s: much the date it's you know day-to-day
3878.40s: nor is normal
3879.68s: but with them wanting to raise rates
3880.96s: aggressively that's definitely going to
3882.80s: put pressure on the market i mean you're
3884.56s: pulling money out of the market the
3885.76s: lifeblood of the market is money and
3887.52s: you're taking money away because you're
3888.72s: making money more expensive but the
3890.64s: other side of that coin as well is
3892.32s: whenever you raise your lower interest
3893.60s: rates you change which sectors are going
3895.68s: to be attractive for institutional
3897.04s: investors within the market
3899.28s: that's why you're seeing technology get
3900.72s: killed and energy is and other things
3902.48s: are so strong because of inflation and
3903.92s: all that
3904.96s: i think those trends are going to
3905.92s: persist the trade i'm most excited about
3908.32s: now is probably the oil trade oh
3910.64s: interesting
3911.68s: i i think again this kind of goes back
3913.52s: funnily enough funny enough to to my
3915.36s: early years where again resource
3916.72s: companies and my global macro
3918.16s: perspective but you know so many oil
3920.08s: companies were really beat up last year
3921.60s: well now two years ago 2020 because oil
3924.16s: was negative at one point right in the
3925.60s: march contract they couldn't find
3926.96s: storage for it
3928.08s: so you know when you're gonna you know
3929.84s: there's a way i kind of build my overall
3931.44s: thesis right so when i'm approaching the
3932.88s: markets and i always time it technically
3935.28s: so the fed's raising rates that makes
3937.60s: companies with current real earnings
3939.44s: more attractive you know if rates are
3941.12s: going up and you're a tech stock
3942.56s: promising earnings 10 years from now
3944.72s: well as rates are higher it's more
3946.48s: expensive for me to sit there and wait
3948.08s: for those right so so that's why that
3950.24s: attracting this shifts from
3952.16s: high p e
3953.44s: uh lower no earning stocks to lower p e
3955.84s: higher news so that's why that's the
3957.20s: sector switch that the flows will be
3959.20s: towards energy i believe
3961.04s: a second reason i like energy is there
3962.48s: are in the current oil environment
3964.08s: they're basically printing money the
3966.08s: profits are huge some of these companies
3968.40s: are making record earnings already
3970.48s: um
3971.60s: they're very reluctant especially
3973.12s: american shale producers are very
3974.64s: reluctant to put to put out more oil
3976.80s: rigs to take out more oil right they got
3978.32s: slammed so hard yep a lot of companies
3980.24s: went through restructuring board of
3981.28s: directors says uh you're going to be
3982.56s: very careful with what capital you put
3984.24s: out because we don't know is kobe going
3985.60s: to come back
3986.72s: are they going to you know keep putting
3988.24s: pressure on oil companies for you know
3990.08s: climate change or whatever so you're not
3991.68s: going to go out there and put out more
3993.60s: drilling unless you're really sure of
3996.32s: the demand situation and the rest same
3998.56s: with the opec countries exact same
4000.32s: situation in fact with russia on the
4002.32s: ukrainian border if there's some kind of
4003.84s: a conflict that would be even more
4005.84s: pressure on the oil price so you put all
4007.92s: of this together and i think personally
4010.80s: i don't know if you know peter lynch
4011.92s: who's the great investor fidelity
4013.20s: investor his his ethos was always buy
4015.52s: what you know buy what you like buy the
4018.08s: the products around you and these are
4019.60s: these great companies well
4021.12s: i don't want to buy anything right now
4022.64s: what i want to do is i want to go out
4023.92s: and live a normal life i want to travel
4025.52s: i want to take a drive and so if if the
4028.00s: world i think come out of this
4029.60s: unfortunate situation and depending
4031.76s: where you are there's still some rather
4033.12s: you know big restrictions if everyone
4034.48s: starts driving in flying again even if
4036.32s: it's incrementally but in in that
4038.08s: direction
4039.12s: because oil companies and oil producing
4041.12s: nations are so
4042.64s: uh restrictive and careful and putting
4044.72s: out new supply
4046.08s: your supply equation is very tight for
4047.84s: oil that's why
4049.28s: uh president biden put oil out with the
4051.04s: strategic petroleum reserve what
4052.40s: happened oil fell well right back up it
4054.24s: was just consumed by the market so the
4055.92s: mar that's telling you the market is
4057.12s: already very tight supply is very tight
4059.60s: and if that demand comes on even if it's
4062.08s: two three four five six months from now
4064.00s: people say that's it i wanna i wanna
4065.52s: take a drive
4066.64s: uh
4067.44s: that increase in demand i think could
4068.80s: take oil up significantly
4071.04s: uh and on top of that with inflation
4073.60s: put yourself in the shoes of the opec
4075.44s: nations our oil will still start your
4077.36s: car but your dollar we can't buy the
4079.76s: same amount of bread at the store
4081.28s: because the dollar has been printed so
4083.28s: they're not as willing to accept lower
4085.36s: prices for the oil so all of this to me
4087.52s: provides a backdrop where there's an
4088.96s: asymmetric setup on oil the downside is
4091.36s: limited maybe
4092.56s: my idea could be wrong maybe we come
4093.84s: down a little bit but if if i'm correct
4095.76s: in my analysis can you see 100 plus oil
4098.88s: absolutely sure and if the oil companies
4100.96s: are already doing great now
4102.72s: well if oil gets to 100 plus they're
4105.04s: really going to be killing it and so and
4106.48s: also then if you look at higher rates
4108.56s: and institutions moving towards these
4110.96s: current earnings type companies now i
4112.96s: can see
4113.92s: this place where this final torrent of
4116.16s: money can come in these oil stocks that
4117.52s: have been so out of favor for so long
4120.16s: and technically the action is great
4121.60s: again you can have all the idea these
4123.36s: ideas and pass on them but for myself
4125.76s: why i'm actually committed i've been
4127.04s: buying oil stocks for for a little while
4128.96s: now
4129.84s: is technically they're acting great
4131.60s: who's making 52-week highs it's not tech
4133.36s: stocks this year
4135.12s: so the market is agreeing with me and no
4137.68s: one's paying attention because oil is no
4139.12s: longer sexy right it's about supposed to
4140.56s: be about green investing and all of that
4142.32s: and so it's kind of been abandoned but
4143.92s: when the earnings come
4145.52s: the money will follow it's just the law
4147.12s: of the market so
4148.48s: that's how i'm reading the market i
4149.84s: think you're going to see pressure on
4150.96s: general markets in general um i think
4153.60s: probably growth stocks are going to wash
4155.28s: out sometime later this year because
4157.04s: it's already a year they've topped i
4158.40s: mean we top basically february 2021 for
4160.88s: a lot of growth stocks
4162.40s: so but in the meantime i think the best
4164.40s: upside trades probably oil beyond that i
4167.44s: think general market gains are going to
4169.52s: be limited just because the federal
4170.56s: reserve's going to be this big weight on
4172.24s: the market
4173.28s: yeah i think that's a obviously
4175.60s: really comprehensive analysis i feel
4177.60s: like a lot of what we experienced in
4179.76s: covid was an experiment by the fed and i
4182.88s: think that
4184.08s: you know
4185.52s: we don't know how the story ends i'm
4188.08s: generally just market bearish like going
4191.28s: into this year
4192.88s: not to say that the year couldn't end up
4195.28s: but i don't think we're seeing 29 return
4198.00s: this year you know with everything
4199.60s: coming towards us
4200.96s: and it's also interesting that you
4202.24s: highlight
4203.68s: um oil specifically so i i do a live
4206.72s: session pretty much every monday and you
4209.04s: know i just about the markets
4210.56s: whatever and anyways for the last few
4213.44s: weeks i i like to pull up um a sector
4216.80s: performance of the
4218.08s: s p 500 and just look at it essentially
4220.56s: week over week and
4222.16s: energy has been at the top and you know
4224.80s: obviously you've already arrived at that
4226.64s: conclusion and have been moving your way
4228.56s: into oil just an interesting point i'm
4231.60s: curious your thoughts on with regards to
4233.52s: oil
4235.20s: is your trade
4237.76s: hypothesis
4239.44s: something within a year or you expecting
4242.48s: slash planning for like a longer term
4245.04s: upside to oil and i asked that just
4246.88s: because for me
4248.40s: i think
4249.60s: there definitely a short term potential
4251.44s: in oil but i really do feel like in a
4253.04s: lot of ways its head is on a chopping
4254.48s: block um once we start getting out like
4257.44s: five plus years like way further out in
4259.12s: time i don't think we're getting rid of
4260.32s: oil anytime soon i think it'll be around
4262.16s: for the foreseeable future but i do feel
4264.80s: like they're constantly under fire you
4267.04s: know for something so i'm just curious
4269.28s: you know when you when you
4271.20s: discuss your trade hypothesis what's the
4272.80s: kind of time frame that you're thinking
4274.80s: for that
4275.68s: yeah it's usually like 12 months out
4277.60s: like again most of my trades are
4279.52s: three months to nine months you know can
4281.36s: they go maybe a year and a half sure
4283.52s: but that's the the rarity you know but
4285.68s: that that's usually like the wheelhouse
4287.12s: i like i like to focus in because once
4289.20s: you start getting beyond nine months or
4290.88s: or more even if it is a five year trade
4292.88s: let's let's say you have this great five
4294.48s: year vision you're gonna have to sit
4296.40s: probably through some some points where
4298.24s: three six nine months where the stock
4299.52s: consolidates drops hard underperforms
4302.16s: again myself is where this is what i do
4304.16s: for a living i don't have i don't have
4305.76s: the uh you know the um ability to just
4307.92s: sit there and say okay i'm gonna sit
4309.28s: here for nine months and have the stock
4310.88s: fall thirty percent while the s p like
4312.64s: i'll rotate elsewhere i just know it's
4314.40s: my personality and i think at a certain
4316.40s: point
4317.20s: you really have to pick what worked for
4318.48s: you as a person and your your situation
4320.80s: so that's what works for me so i'm not i
4322.96s: never myself even focused on five-year
4324.80s: projections because it doesn't really
4325.92s: interest me i'm shorter term guy so it's
4327.84s: really that three nine months twelve
4329.36s: months is the is the you know the
4330.96s: wheelhouse i usually focus on got it
4333.36s: okay yeah and to wrap up i do have one
4335.52s: last question
4336.72s: i am curious i think um the the
4339.52s: technical analysis folks from my
4341.52s: community would probably hang me up to
4344.24s: die if i didn't ask you this
4346.24s: um
4347.28s: when you think about your you obviously
4350.08s: mentioned a few times your your
4351.44s: technical tools looking for confirmation
4353.92s: um what are your top two or three
4358.08s: technical analysis tools that you deploy
4362.88s: i i think uh critical for me are are the
4366.24s: bases that william o'neill taught about
4368.00s: uh i mean some of them are or even
4369.76s: textbook i mean technical analysis basis
4371.68s: but there's real specific criteria he
4373.28s: provides
4374.32s: uh so i i think that's just so important
4376.48s: to to start on a foundation of which
4378.56s: stocks to look at i mean and it's not
4380.48s: just the sh the shape of the pattern
4382.72s: people think you know it looks like a
4384.24s: head and shoulders or this or that
4385.76s: there's also depth you know requirements
4388.00s: it's got to be a certain length of time
4389.84s: and the way he got to these parameters
4392.80s: is he went back to look at all the best
4394.32s: stocks
4395.36s: as they had their major advances in
4396.88s: history and he looked at the basing
4398.56s: patterns to find what are all the
4399.68s: commonalities in the minimum criteria
4401.68s: because a base if you're looking at a
4402.88s: technical price action you can see that
4404.80s: on a five minute chart you can see it on
4406.24s: a monthly chart right but if you're
4407.92s: looking for these stocks they're going
4408.96s: to have these explosive runs as they're
4410.96s: being accumulated by institutions they
4412.80s: have a commonality as to how they form
4414.48s: these bases so that would be step one as
4416.80s: to what i i do
4418.24s: um
4419.36s: i think just you know people are varying
4421.20s: experience and technical analysis just
4422.72s: something basic like the 50-day moving
4424.40s: average like keep your stocks above the
4426.96s: 50-day moving average for your purchases
4428.80s: i mean
4429.60s: um if you're below there i mean
4431.84s: you're you're dealing with a stock
4432.96s: that's maybe either in a correction or
4434.48s: has already started a downtrend so just
4436.16s: at least above a 50-day
4438.08s: and beyond that well the technical tools
4440.56s: there's many that i use i probably have
4441.84s: to show you on a chart but i think
4443.52s: there's no real super secret i i picked
4445.60s: the ones over the years that are i feel
4447.60s: are most effective that work best with
4449.36s: me
4450.08s: uh for me as well i would say but keep a
4452.48s: variety so by that i mean some people
4454.88s: let's say like an oscillator some people
4456.40s: like short-term chart patterns if you
4458.24s: have a variety for different types of
4459.52s: situations
4461.04s: not every stock advance will be the same
4462.72s: so for some sometimes a stock advance is
4464.64s: quick and you'll get like a flag pattern
4466.80s: because it's a quick pattern sometimes a
4468.24s: little bit slower and other patterns
4469.60s: will show up so
4471.04s: you know if you have a a larger you know
4473.92s: a diverse set of tools you'll be able to
4475.92s: capture entries on a variety of type of
4478.64s: stock moves that's the way i would i
4480.16s: would look at it so awesome yeah that's
4482.40s: really helpful thank you i'd love to you
4484.56s: know set up another session with you
4486.16s: sometime to chat about that a little bit
4487.52s: more because i know a lot of people are
4488.88s: super interested in that and it would be
4491.28s: really cool you know even for for me to
4493.84s: to learn a little bit more about your
4495.36s: general technical analysis approach
4497.20s: because
4498.00s: there's i'm kind of similar in that way
4500.56s: where my again most of what i do is via
4503.84s: what i learned from from that mentor of
4505.84s: mine i i mention him so frequently not
4508.08s: to talk about it like it's this
4509.68s: mysterious dude but it's because i don't
4511.44s: feel comfortable taking credit for most
4514.08s: of what i do because it literally is
4515.92s: from him but anyways he was really big
4517.76s: into like super simple you know
4519.92s: technical analysis he uses like 150-day
4522.24s: moving average 50-day moving average and
4525.44s: that's about it so it's funny most
4528.08s: people i know uh
4530.00s: after years of experience become very
4531.76s: simple myself included i like again i
4534.32s: did my charter market technician the cmt
4536.56s: designation which is everything
4538.00s: technical analysis and i just have
4539.76s: oscillators indicators and bands and all
4541.44s: this on my charts and right now my
4544.24s: charts are so simple it's just it's just
4546.00s: candlestick charts with my moving
4547.52s: averages other tools i use like net
4549.36s: highs and lows is it's breadth it's not
4551.28s: you know it's the market itself
4552.24s: composition it's not it's not a
4553.60s: technical indicator right the same
4555.60s: definition and so i've just become so
4557.68s: simple over time and my goal now is less
4559.84s: about
4560.80s: you know looking at all these these
4562.32s: lines and indicators more about trying
4563.84s: to understand is there more are
4566.48s: institutions net buyers or net sellers
4568.48s: so i i come to the stock chart not by
4571.12s: trying to see a pattern but trying to
4572.64s: read what is the pattern telling me i
4574.00s: think that's a really important
4574.96s: distinction to me yeah
4577.04s: yeah i i think that that is
4579.44s: a kind of a profound distinction because
4581.44s: a lot of people
4582.64s: see a chart and they try to impose
4584.48s: whatever their you know analysis says
4587.04s: yeah absolutely that's a really profound
4588.96s: statement
4590.16s: um and then i i think i lied to you
4592.40s: because i have one final question um do
4595.12s: you do you use any sort of like volume
4597.44s: profile or v-wap anchored v-wap anything
4600.24s: like that because it sounds like when
4601.68s: you're talking about institutional
4603.76s: pricing that you know those tools at
4606.32s: least for me come to come to mind but
4607.92s: i'm curious if that's something that you
4609.04s: use for that
4610.16s: it's not it's not something i use uh to
4612.24s: be honest really i like to look at uh
4614.64s: the volume on the chart versus what a
4616.72s: stock average typically trades in a day
4618.48s: you know but uh i never really got
4620.08s: beyond that what i find a very key
4621.76s: important tool and that's nothing i
4623.60s: created but you know if you're buying a
4625.04s: stock during the day
4626.80s: that's breaking out or something and
4628.16s: these these kind of more advanced
4629.20s: discussion but you know
4631.36s: the the day is not created equal so for
4633.60s: example
4634.48s: at 10 o'clock in the day you know you're
4636.64s: only a small fraction you know into the
4638.72s: day
4639.52s: so if you just kind of say like oh you
4641.04s: know let's say we're 10 of the trading
4643.28s: day is complete are we doing 10 of the
4644.80s: volume that's not a fair analysis you
4646.24s: have to know how much your stock
4647.76s: typically trades in the first half hour
4649.52s: because you know where stocks you're the
4651.04s: openers that's their most active time of
4652.80s: the day so in real time in real time
4655.36s: application you want to know is it above
4657.60s: average volume but is it also above
4659.28s: average volume for that time of day yeah
4661.68s: so so that's that's like a way i like to
4663.92s: use volume real time when i'm putting my
4666.40s: position on to understand is this is
4668.56s: this move real right now i mean either
4670.80s: i'm buying on a pullback or
4671.76s: consolidation but if i'm buying into
4673.28s: strength because i think there's a
4674.32s: breakout or something you know happening
4676.64s: that's an important way i like to
4677.84s: approach the market
4679.12s: got it yeah that's awesome thank you i
