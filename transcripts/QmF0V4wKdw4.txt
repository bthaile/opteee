0.00s: What's up everybody Eric here? We are back with another outlier podcast and today I got David Hunter back again. I think this is like your fifth or sixth time. These are actually becoming really, really cool for me to be able to see how things progress over our quarters, you know, in between conversations. So welcome back yet again.
22.00s: Yeah, thanks. You're glad to be back.
24.48s: One of the interesting things I noticed from our conversations is unlike the the bull market, like just about every time we talk.
32.36s: There's some sort of crisis or just crazy stuff going on that I'm really eager to get your opinion on and obviously the latest well, the latest goes on and on. But one of the things that's been invoked lately is the debt ceiling.
46.68s: And I want to get your thoughts on that because here's the primary part I truly don't understand and this is the fun part of these is I get to ask really smart people questions and learn.
56.28s: So when the federal government does their budget, I feel like they have a general idea of our spend our run rate decent projections.
66.08s: Yet we almost always at least recently run into this debt ceiling problem where unless we pass something in a certain amount of time, the government defaults on its debt.
77.28s: Why like why does that happen? I don't understand why it always comes to this crisis moment. Is it down to the two sides kind of ball King and trying to use
87.40s: The debt ceiling is a way to pass other initiatives or is there something economically intertwined that leads to a defunct between budgeting projections and then when it comes time for kind of the debt ceiling conversations.
100.64s: Yeah, it's a good question. I'll answer it in a few kind of few different pieces to it.
106.40s: Years ago and I don't remember when the debt ceiling was put in there, but they put it in to kind of put a some kind of a breaker on things to at least instill what they thought would be a little bit of a conscious or you know some kind of limitation on our spending.
125.04s: Obviously I haven't I haven't worked that we've grown our deficits from you know sub trillion to 30 some trillion now so you know that didn't work very well, but it was I think that was the intent initially was that if you have a ceiling you're going to have to consciously and with a vote come back to approve a higher ceiling.
149.76s: So, but it's gotten silly because we we hit the ceiling so quickly every you know couple of years and and so you know there are people that are saying we shouldn't have a ceiling but you know it's a silly thing anyway where it's really you know you voted in a budget and you need to honor your you know if you're if you're going to have a budget and it exceeds you've got it unless you want to default you've got to honor it.
178.60s: So, so you know it's almost an automatic you got to have the ceiling up tire I get that but the Republicans in particular have used the ceiling as something to at least give them some negotiating leverage versus a left that wants to just tax on spend.
199.88s: Right so I mean at least from my view the Republicans have done a great job on fiscal discipline themselves but if you're going to look at two parties one is definitely tax and spend and the other one at least gives lip service and tries to some extent and still some discipline not very much these days but some so you know particularly in in the where we are now or left.
225.96s: So much or the Democrats have so much power you know they control the Senate they control the the presidency and they don't have you know the Republicans have very small majority in the house you know that Republicans don't have a lot of places where they can gain leverage so the debt ceiling is something where some people say you shouldn't negotiate over that you should you know do a clean debts ceiling increase.
255.00s: And you know negotiate the budget separately well with real in reality the House would not have much leverage and get anything you know the they'd be run over so they're trying to use this to instill a little bit of discipline and I certainly from my perspective it's correct to try to put in some kind of limitations on future spending and you know talking about 1% increases per year.
282.60s: Um the in truth those increases are you know what when we say we're only increase 1% it's it's not truly 1% increase it's a 1% over what we would normally increase right there's they build in so many automatic increases that it's it's kind of a silly comment say it's 1% but so they're not even really instilling tremendous discipline but it's some and even that you know the Biden administration and the Democrats are blocking that because I feel they're in the middle of the Senate.
312.60s: And the driver's seat they want everything so and so what happens is you come down and we saw this in 2011 we've seen it in past that ceiling negotiations it and we've seen it and frankly in almost everything it's you know the House and Senate I mean the Democrats from public it's always come down to the last minute before they get budget to grade 2 etc so so I think this is no different you're going to come down to the last minute.
342.60s: You know both sides are going to post your both sides are going to tell you that they're not giving in an inch or that there's very little they they can't see the other sides argument they think they have the you know the better argument and then in the end I think they'll they'll reach some kind of an agreement on it.
359.60s: You know it's part of it is silliness part of it is the art of you know this is what compromise is in Congress and it just doesn't happen to you are forced to make it happen so you get a lot of rhetoric around that you get the media playing it up you get the markets nervous over it and there's always possibility that you know they can't come to that the both sides get entrenched and you don't get.
389.60s: An agreement initially and you do go past some deadline and you do run it to you know some payments not being made or what have you I think the fault is unlikely they'll probably they can they can go other places and not make you know not.
405.60s: Cover the outlays you know hopefully not so secure your medicare but it's a place like that they don't have they can pay their interest on the death there's enough cash flow that they don't have to default on the death.
418.60s: If they understand the importance of maintaining that triple A and maintaining credibility in the world so it's probably not a June one deadline but it's going to get a lot of messier after June one so so the odds are we get an agreement I don't think they're really that far apart if.
438.60s: If the Biden administration is willing to not feel like they got all the cards you know it's silly after what we just spent in our last few bills because of the pandemic it's silly for them to say we we don't want to put anything you know they so so I think that's probably you know you're going to give your strongest.
463.60s: You're going to show your strongest cards first and then you know negotiate as you have to but so I'm I'm expecting the debt ceiling to be raised I'm expecting the house to get something they're probably not going to get all what they have and they're you know the bad budget they passed.
482.60s: And you may you may see the Biden administration get something on the other side in terms of tax increases in some of the areas are cutting some loopholes you know from certain higher and income or corporate corporations would have you so I expect you're going to see compromise on this and it will happen but until it does we know we have a very dysfunctional government with two sides that don't agree on anything.
510.60s: You know pretty polarized so it's right for markets to be nervous until they see the likelihood of something so that's what we're going through and I think that's what we've been going through this week markets you know we're getting closer and it's still both the I dream and trying to so markets get nervous you know that's what they do.
533.60s: So yeah that's you know that's the biggest thing hanging over us right now it would be easy to say we do this all time just move past it but you really can because you know there's always that chance.
546.60s: Yeah and it's interesting you say there's always that chance because from like a trading perspective ever since we started going through these cycles I started really carefully tracking the market around the debt ceiling discussion since because like since 2002 to 2021 we've had like
562.60s: 20 of these conversations literally 20 and I started realizing these are actually pretty tradable events because bonds are pretty predictable leading into the conversation the markets pretty predictable in terms of volatility leading to the conversation but there's always that black swan race on the back end if if we did default and funny enough for that I typically will use teeny options I'll go far out of the money and I'll just scoop up some cheap options literally do you know what I'm going to do.
591.60s: So I'm just going to do this literally just in that it's a lot of it's just in case that happens the pal would be massive so that's what I will say though is that it's unlikely you know when we say default it'd be a temporary default they're not going to let this thing go very far you know if if one side or the other decides you know it's worth us to get something to hold our position and let it get past that deadline and see what you know get people scared.
620.60s: You could go past to a point where you know ratings agencies say we're about to downgrade you because you guys haven't you know come doing agreement that's the only haven't been raised or you know something else so you can have you know it may not be a dead June first deadline or may not happen right you may not get the agreement right when you ideally should get it but they're not they're not going to go months beyond that and just watch the country fall.
650.60s: So I think that's the only thing that I think is the agreement that's going to be a real deal is that the agreement can be made there's there definitely ability for the two sides compromise and get this done.
661.60s: The sad part is and at the very least I can kick the can down the road a handful of months agree to some kind of compromise short term that you know gives them more time.
672.60s: So I think that's the only thing that I think is the only thing that I think is the only thing that I think is the only thing that I think is the only thing that I think is the only thing that I think is the only thing that I think is the only thing that I think is the only thing that I think is the only thing that I think is the only thing that I think is the only thing that I think is the only thing that I think is the only thing that I think is the only thing that I think is the only thing that I think is the only thing that I think is the only thing that I think is the only thing that I think is the only thing that I think is the only thing that I think is the only thing that I think is the only thing that I think is the only thing that I think is the only thing that I think is the only thing that I think is the only thing that I think is the only thing that I think is the only thing that I think is the only thing that I think is the only thing that I think
702.60s: that they can turn it around as soon as they want to. It's just the matter of their posture. They're playing who's gonna you know, each one. It seems so it'll all of us by standards. But to them, they each want to win. You know. Who's going to get a win out of this? And frankly, we're losers because they play that game. But. So it's just follow. I think it gives you more volatility. But I don't think it's.
732.60s: That's a game break anyway.
734.60s: Totally agree. And that actually is a beautiful segue into my follow on question, which is
739.40s: if we typically know that on the back end there are these series of resolutions and we also,
745.96s: because I completely agree with you, the propensity for them to just let go of the wheel and let
750.28s: this thing crash is so unbelievably unlikely. Why do we even see the level of volatility that we do
757.00s: leading into these events? Because that really has baffled me because I typically trade volatility
760.84s: around bonds and markets into the announcement. And I am well obviously you can't always completely
767.16s: isolate the volatility, right? There's other stuff happening in the world, but it does seem to
771.56s: kick up around these debt ceiling conversations and it just confuses me as to why that even exists.
777.96s: Yeah, well because there is uncertainty. I mean, it does seem like the uncertainty gets over
782.84s: blown. You know, the media should, investors should be able to ignore the media and say,
788.28s: we've been here before, we see you guys always overreact etc. But there's still that uncertainty,
794.92s: you know, uncertainty of what could happen if this happens, you know. So that's part of it.
801.32s: And part of it certainly this time is where are you when you go into this? And we're overbought.
808.12s: We've had this run since October and of late we've had this run back up from below 4,000 up to 4,200.
817.56s: So there was, you know, a bit of overbought and you were beginning to get people nervous that they
823.00s: were missing the market. So there's more talk about and probably some activity in terms of people
829.16s: repositioning back for the upside. So you were at a point where if we were very oversold and this
835.40s: was going on, you might have not seen this, but because we were short term overbought and there
842.20s: were becoming more believers in the market because of the momentum. You know, the, the
849.08s: seal debt ceiling problem is an excuse to set up. I mean, it gives you a reason to set up. So
858.52s: And before you comment it a little bit on the capacity to serve as debt, I'm curious what you make
863.48s: of the, it's kind of out of the limelight now, but I'm still wondering your thoughts on the
870.12s: conversation about the reserve currency status of the dollar and the overall strength of the dollar.
874.60s: What do you make of that dialogue? I think most of it, keep in mind, there's been, there's been
881.48s: that school out there, particularly the Austrians that have been pushing this for a long time. You
886.44s: know, we've been talking about this for several years. So this is kind of, they jump on this because of,
894.28s: you know, what, what, obviously what China and Russia are doing, what the Saudis recently did with China,
901.00s: you know, all that just fits into that expectation that, hey, the dollar is vulnerable and we're
906.84s: going to lose reserves to that. So, so that crowd is expecting. So this just feeds into what they're
913.16s: expecting and others have jumped onto it because that's all over, you know, social media now and
920.44s: somewhat in Wall Street about that possibility. I continue to say, and I've consistently said it for
926.92s: years, I think we can lose reserve status down the road, but I don't think it's in the next five
932.76s: years. We will, you know, see it continually be roaded away with some of this stuff independent
939.32s: deals. And certainly we gave, you know, we gave our enemies an excuse or, or more firepower to
946.44s: go out and do this with using the dollar is kind of a weapon, you know, we've weaponized a dollar
954.68s: in terms of trying to use it in the Ukraine war situation and against Russia, you know, do
961.56s: one thing. So, so I think I'm not sure we thought that through and I think we have heard ourselves
968.04s: in that. And I think the rest of the world, even those that aren't having happened to them right now,
973.96s: see us as a bit of a bully with the dollar, you know, we have that power and we exercise it to get
979.88s: our way on things. So, so I get where, you know, that's a risk. I just don't think there's anything to
987.32s: replace it in the near term. I think the IMF, I didn't go farther than the headlines, but I think the
993.24s: IMF commented in the last couple days about they don't see the, you know, dollar going away as reserve
999.32s: currency for any time soon. And I would agree with that. So, and kind of parallel to that, as you
1007.64s: well know, is this worry about a, you know, digitized currency, you know, a central bank currency
1017.80s: or coming out of that. And I, that I have less conviction on. I certainly am worried about the
1029.80s: underlying agenda that seems to be sweeping through this, you know, new world-ordered agenda,
1035.00s: whatever you want to call it. And this feeds into that, gives, gives them more control over the
1040.84s: population and population of money. So, I hope we avoid that for many years to come. I think it's
1048.84s: dangerous, you know, central bank digital currency, but, but I don't want to make a conviction in terms
1056.20s: of timing for that. I think the global bus that's coming will sidetrack any of that stuff.
1063.80s: They may think they can introduce it in the next year. They're going to have so much more on their
1068.68s: plate that I think is going to get postponed. So, I don't know when it comes. I don't look forward
1075.72s: to it coming. I think it's a huge danger. And I hope we can keep, okay, in the can down the road
1083.56s: or keep fighting them on it. But that one I don't feel as confident I can say is, you know,
1089.72s: one five years away. Got it. What do you make of the previous earning season as it pertains to
1097.88s: the overall strength of the market? And then more importantly, do you think that impacts the flow
1103.64s: of funds into equities out of equities? Certainly, earnings are a part of, you know, a big part of
1111.72s: what drives stock prices. And we've certainly had a hit to earnings or decline in earnings in the
1119.24s: last 12 months because of, you know, what's going on with central bank and interest rates, etc.
1127.88s: But what the interplay is the interesting part, I think, because what you have, as you well know,
1133.88s: there's a quarterly game where the company's lower expectations. So when the reports come out by
1139.16s: then, you know, they're beating expectations. And that's what gets reported on off a lot of the time.
1145.64s: But I think that whole process is why stock discount things going in. You know, one particular bear
1155.48s: out there who shall be nameless, but I think you can pretty much figure out who it is, was really
1163.80s: talking about first quarter earnings being the catalyst for a move, you know, down to 3,500 or below.
1172.20s: And it didn't manifest. And I think a lot of a number one, I think he
1178.60s: overestimated the degree to which the earnings were decelerating. And number two, you know,
1185.48s: underestimated how much has already been discounted. My whole argument, and you know, I'm calling for
1191.64s: a melt-up. My whole argument is that the market's not ignoring, you know, what's going on in
1199.48s: economy and just, you know, people unfortunately, particularly retail investors, think markets move
1206.28s: on current information. I keep saying they discount many months in advance, six, nine months in advance.
1211.56s: You know, last year, so off, what's about what we're getting now, you know, there's enough
1216.84s: bleeding indicators and things that you can look at to know what's coming. And so I think, you know,
1223.00s: we bottomed in October. And what we're doing now is we're, we're, we had the first leg of, you know,
1229.80s: first part of that move up towards the, you know, final highs that I'm calling for. And we've kind
1235.80s: of gotten stuck in a train range of, you know, the last few months because everything, you know,
1243.40s: earnings are not moving for. There's, you know, the central banks are not showing. They're ready to
1248.68s: ease. They're all that thing, all those things, I think, put the markets on hold. So they've been
1253.96s: under trading range with upward bias, but a trading range. I think we pretty soon with the Fed having
1260.52s: to, I won't say capitulate, but having to, you know, move to the sidelines, pause. I think that's
1268.36s: going to help as a catalyst to move us up passes 4200. I think next stop is 42, 4600, 4600,
1280.68s: and from there, you know, I think we keep going. Still with you. Still out for a second.
1287.72s: Yeah, no, that was, but yeah, no, I'm still, yeah, I got you at 4600, so one of the, the things
1296.20s: I'm curious about when the last three times we've talked, we've kind of covered this idea of the
1301.80s: melt up into the, the bust and definitely when we first started talking about it, the timeline
1306.84s: has moved a few times and new information comes out that's part of the game. So based on what you're
1313.56s: seeing now in like the current markets, where does your forecast stand? Yeah, it's true. I mean,
1320.92s: I'm moving target in terms of timing because that's an end of cycle. So yeah, and frankly,
1328.04s: it frustrates traders because traders are, and even though I say don't do it, don't listen to me
1333.48s: as a trader because my timing's not going to be right. It's, it's basically just laying from a
1341.88s: market standpoint, not the kind, but just the market. Every time you get a consolidation, it extends
1348.12s: if a consolidation to month or two, it extends to maybe a month or two, but if consolidation's
1353.08s: gone for a while, like they did last year, it extends everything. So, and so I give some, and maybe
1362.84s: the problem is I give some idea of what could happen if this thing all falls into place,
1368.28s: how fast it could happen. But I'm not saying that's, that's some kind of time frame and it's almost
1375.48s: a given that it's going to get extended if the market extends. So if the consolidation's take time.
1381.80s: So right now, I'm kind of using late summer as the next time, you know, the, where everything
1390.76s: if everything falls into place, if the rally gets going as soon as I think it's going to, which is,
1395.24s: you know, soon as soon as this thing, you know, this next week or whatever the sell-off ends, pull
1401.72s: back ends, you could get this back in. The big question is for me is 46, 50, let's say,
1409.96s: or maybe 40, even the old highs around 4,800, if that's where the next step is, the real million
1417.24s: dollar question from there is, do we get a sizeable pullback of say 10%, I see some of, you know,
1423.64s: possibility of that, and that could take you, you know, a couple months and stretch everything out.
1430.28s: If you, if you instead kind of, you know, pause at the highs and then push right on through,
1437.80s: I think the meltup gets going very quickly. And when I think people don't understand is the
1442.28s: meltup part of this, you could, you could cover 2000 points in, you know, four to eight weeks.
1450.76s: So it's really, it's the time that it takes to get to that point where the meltup really kicks in
1457.40s: is the unknowable, you know, does it happen? Do we get 40, 100 next month? And then
1465.88s: spend three months or two months pulling back before we go, or do we push through the new highs
1471.64s: and that gets everybody saying, oh, the bear market's over, I'm going, and you get that final
1476.92s: search, because, you know, this is the last stage. It's going to be, once it gets going, it's going
1481.72s: to be vertical. And so that's, so I think it's definitely this year. I think it's probably by
1489.80s: Labor Day, but if it push back beyond that, that doesn't bother me either. You know, again,
1496.36s: it's the end of the cycle. It's also the end. When I say the end of cycle, it's the end of a 41-year
1502.04s: bull market cycle, a bull market cycle. Yeah, I'm not worried about picking a pretty
1507.64s: slice time that that ends. It's, it's, you know, we're on our way.
1511.96s: So for like a 2000 point rally in eight weeks or so that would, at least from here,
1518.28s: represent like a 50% gain, something like that. I think the question there is, I mean, that's
1524.04s: kind of an unprecedented move. So what, what precipitates that? What causes that move? Is it the
1531.00s: rakes? I know last time we talked about the conversation around whenever the Fed chooses to
1535.32s: finally pause, which we're starting to see some of that being priced into the bond market.
1540.44s: I'm wondering like, what's the primary catalyst here? Yeah, actually, the bond market in late
1545.64s: day, in recent days, it's not pricing in that. They're pricing in, you know, more concerned, but I
1550.36s: think it's over the debt ceiling primarily. You know, you, you had, and I've talked about it for
1555.16s: not to jump around, but I've talked about for the last month or two that there are gaps up,
1561.96s: you know, 10 Europe around 390 and even another one a little higher in the 30 Europe around 4%.
1568.76s: And when the 10 year was down at, you know, 330, 335, I said, there's still a possibility we might
1575.80s: go back to age 4%. And that seems to be where we're headed. You know, we got up to 375 yesterday.
1583.48s: So, you know, to me, those things are just, you know, you don't go in a straight line.
1589.80s: You know, the markets love to get you looking one way and go the other, correct.
1595.64s: And so, that's a part of it, but I forgot what your question was.
1603.80s: I'm curious about the catalyst for like 2000 points, essentially, in a short timeframe.
1608.28s: Yeah, so, so I think ultimately, you're going to have as the tailwinds for this run will be first and
1617.64s: foremost, the Fed going from tightening to pause. I know, you know, it's possible or sometimes
1627.72s: during the meltup phase that they, they, you know, things get really ugly in the economy and they
1634.76s: or in the financial system and they say we got to cut rates. But more likely, I think they're
1639.24s: going to be on pause and pause to a lot of people is going to be, you know, to the Fed, pause may be,
1646.20s: we're going to pause for a few months and see what happens and then we may come back and tighten.
1651.48s: But I think a lot of investors are going to hear pause as the Fed's tightening cycle is over.
1657.72s: And I can't stress enough that the all the bearishness that we've had from the end of 2021 to now
1666.76s: has been doing and and and and the talk of bearishness even six months prior to that, you know,
1671.40s: middle of 2021, we start talking about the need for Fed tightening. That's been a headwind for the
1678.12s: market for, you know, basically a year. I should say basically almost two years, you know, year and
1685.08s: half. And so if you remove that, if investors say, wow, tight things ending, that, I think people
1693.88s: underestimate how important that is. Now, I know there's a chart out there saying when the Fed cuts
1699.00s: rates, that's time to get bearish, right? You've seen that chart that, you know, past cycles.
1706.60s: But pause is cutting rates. Pause is just giving investors reasonably the Fed may be ending
1713.80s: tightening. And for for knowledgeable institutional investors, the end of tightening, they can then
1721.24s: and the beginning of ease, they can then look over the trough and say, with a six to month,
1727.64s: nine months lag, we can now start factoring in increases in earnings. We can now factor in a
1735.40s: new cycle or recovery cycle. So that's why that's also important. And that will be a big tailwind.
1741.64s: Along with that, I expect will be a big decline in the dollar. I think the dollar, you know,
1747.72s: has been backing up here short term came down 14 points. It's it's resonant, you know, to
1752.84s: and a half points. I could go another point or two. But ultimately, I see the DXY down to 95,
1760.28s: six very quickly, you know, during next two, three months. And then might pause there and before it
1768.60s: had a lot lower than that. So the dollar is going to be, I think, a big catalyst or a big tailwind.
1775.08s: And then also interest rates. Once they get done with this backup, and I think we're 90% of the
1782.12s: way through the rate backup, you're going to then head for my target is 250 is the next
1788.68s: place where the 10 year goes. So if you're up, let's say you're up at 4%, that's a, you know,
1794.12s: 150 base point drop in rates, probably this summer. So, you know, you get rates on your side,
1801.96s: you get the dollar on your side, you get the Fed on your side. And the one that I think
1809.08s: is not economic, but it certainly is a big factor is then you got momentum and momentum may be
1815.72s: the biggest thing that drives people, pulls people into the market. Everybody can talk about fundamental
1821.24s: reasons for why they're bullish or bearish. Basically, if you look at, you know, look at Twitter
1827.96s: or look at anywhere, watch, listen to investors, most of it's driven by momentum. They're bearish when
1833.88s: the market's going down, they're bullish when the market's breaking above resistance.
1838.20s: That big, yep, it will be a big part of it. So they can talk all they want about them, and you could,
1845.64s: you could, um, practice, you know, you can list all the investors, all the pundits who are bearish
1853.08s: because the market's heading down right now. If that thing pushes above 4,200 and certainly
1858.60s: above 4,300, those same guys that are so sure we're going lower, I'm going to be so sure we're going
1865.08s: north at that point because, you know, whether they, whether they even know what themselves,
1871.08s: they're driven by the tape. Last question, I know we're at time, but the David Hunter precious metal mafia
1879.72s: will murder me if I don't ask you about metals. I've learned this the hard way.
1884.68s: Last time we spoke, you were looking at 3000 on gold. This was back on 23 January. You were
1890.44s: looking at 3000 and gold 50 to 60 for silver gold. It looks like we've gotten a bit of that rally
1895.96s: same for silver, but how does, how do those targets stand? And again, just succinctly, you know,
1903.40s: not to take too much your time, but like what's the catalyst for us to complete the move? Yeah, I
1907.32s: think I'm glad you asked because I think it is an important part of the market. And I think we're
1913.00s: very close to a huge turn. It's been frustrating for both gold and silver investors. No question.
1922.04s: You know, they have, I consider gold and silver to be the most undervalued sector of the market.
1931.32s: And a lot of that is because they've underperformed so long. Gold interestingly, the metal
1936.92s: you're right. It's pushing up, it pushed up against the highs actually ticked up to the highs,
1941.88s: the ultimate highs. So it's not like it's acting poorly, but it's had a pullback of late.
1947.96s: So we're back down, you know, 1960s. Yeah, so I think I think maybe 1940, 50 is where I think it turns.
1959.80s: So if we're that close, I mean, basically that can happen in an hour or a day. So I think we're
1966.76s: very close to a turn and so we'll track that. Silver is pretty close to what I would call a level.
1974.76s: And so my my near term expectation is that you see, you know, gold push through those highs.
1981.08s: And then, you know, it'll find the level when there it's 23, 4, 500, probably closer to 4,
1986.36s: 524 or 500, where it might have to pause again, but I still see 3000 this year. I still see
1995.00s: silver at 60. Silver is a harder one because of farther than a lot farther ago. Of course, in a
2001.80s: bull market, in a metal bull market, silver will outperform gold, but that's a big out performance.
2007.48s: And so, you know, 35 is kind of a natural place where it could get to where it runs into some
2013.88s: resistance. Once it pushes through there, I think you're going to see a really gain momentum and
2018.92s: and get up to 50 and then 60. So, but it doesn't, yeah, I don't want people to get ahead of them.
2025.00s: So I was I think that it just runs from, you know, 23 where it's at now to 60 without any stair steps.
2032.20s: It's going to, you know, it's going to have pauses along the way and pull backs along the way. So, but
2038.44s: but I think those are areas that are going to be front and center in the meltup. I think sick
2045.00s: locals in general, you didn't ask this, but I think sick locals in general in this last three
2051.24s: month pullback where everybody's talking about the the narrowness of a rally, you know, up until today.
2058.52s: You know, it was a rally, you know, we were 4,200 just a couple days ago. And it was driven by the
2064.36s: fangs and by, you know, a handful of, you know, tech technology stocks that are growth stocks.
2072.20s: Because the economies, you know, people are worried about the economy. And, you know, the
2077.56s: growth stocks aren't, it's not so important what the economy is doing. So, so they have and they were
2083.40s: very, they came into this year very oversol, very undervalued or at least had come down more than
2089.40s: anything else. So, they've had reasons to rally. I think sick locals, which had a pretty good
2095.16s: early this year, you know, they ran in January. And they have been consolidating their gains for a
2102.28s: while several months. They look poised for big returns or big moves up here. So, I think you
2110.28s: can see a much broader rally from here. With sick locals doing well copper, interestingly to me,
2117.88s: has come down to a pretty good trend line and pretty important trend line. And I suspect copper is
2124.60s: going to do very well in this run to the top. You know, industrial should do pretty well. Housing
2131.40s: home builders are surprising. Everybody didn't surprise me because I said, when his rates are coming
2136.04s: down, you're going to see another bounce in housing. It doesn't mean you're going to see new highs
2140.76s: and home prices. But you're going to see activity pick up this spring. And I said that, you know,
2145.80s: late last year, when it looked crummy for, you know, housing. And that's what you're seeing. I think
2153.00s: the home builders have outperformed this year. They've pulled back of late just recently the last
2158.60s: couple days. But I do expect new highs on home builders. I think airlines are waking up here. I
2166.84s: think you're hearing talk of a pretty good summer season for the airlines travel season. So,
2173.24s: and with a whale down where it is, that's a benefit to airlines. So, you know, you got a lot of
2179.24s: areas that have been out of favor for a long time. But they don't have to go sky high. But if they
2186.12s: have big rallies off a pretty low basis, that can be a big contributor to, you know, where the
2192.28s: indexes go. And of course, you know, I continue to push, continue to talk about the semis.
2199.24s: And Vity gets all the focus. But, you know, there's others, you know, even, you know, the kind of
2209.64s: commodity side, you know, the chip, the commodity chips like micro. You see, and you see,
2216.44s: and things pick up. And I, you know, SMH, I think can go to 400. And I think that's a low,
2224.36s: low target. I would expect it probably to exceed my target. So, you know, there's plenty of
2230.76s: runway here ahead to drive this meltup. Dig it. Yeah. And Vity is reporting right now too. I'm
2237.72s: curious how they do. Yeah, that is it out. Yeah, I didn't see the press release yet, but they're
2246.04s: after the market. Yeah, they should be out anytime. Yeah. Yeah, they should be really soon. Well,
2251.64s: I got to say, David, as always, it really is a pleasure. I get to learn a lot about how you view
2256.52s: the markets, the economy, connect dots. It's like really educational. And I want to continue to
2261.56s: implore people that I think some of the most thoughtful value that you provide is how to view
2269.40s: relationships between things. And I think people should really key into that into the conversation.
2275.00s: So before we sign off, though, for the people that want to look you up, how can they get a hold
2280.44s: sure? Yeah, I'm on Twitter every day, as you know, and my handle is at Dave H. Contrarian.
2288.44s: And I've had to say this lately in my in my interviews is there are a lot of fake accounts out there.
2294.84s: So be very careful. You know, I've got over 190,000 followers of fake accounts.
2300.68s: Typically have under a thousand and sometimes under, you know, a few hundred. So, you know,
2307.24s: it's kind of the, the nuisance that anybody with a big following has, you know, you go across
2314.04s: board and you see others that are complaining about their fake accounts of people are being fooled by.
2319.08s: But, you know, I had one recently that I was blocked, so I didn't see it. But somebody said,
2324.52s: he's basically taken all of your tweets and put them on his and it looks like you. He's got your profile
2331.64s: picture and your profile. And yet it's, you know, it's fake accounts. So you've got to look carefully
2337.24s: at the, you know, the user name, the handle at Dave H. Contrarian. What they do a lot is they'll
2344.84s: take one letter and change it. So Contrarian, they might put an M in where the N is or put an L in,
2351.56s: just stick another letter in. So you really got to be, it's buyer beware or you just got to look at it.
2358.60s: But there, you know, dozens of them out. Yeah, that's no problem. I'll throw the correct link in
2363.96s: the notes below so that people can get over. Yeah. And I do have a investment letter that comes
2369.64s: out quarterly. It's by subscription. So there's, you know, subscription fee with it. And I always tell
2375.32s: people I don't promote it on Twitter. But if they want information, they can come, you know,
2381.16s: direct message on Twitter. So come to my private message. And I'll provide them information.
2388.52s: Awesome. Yeah. I'll get all that in the notes below. And thank you so much for joining us for
2392.60s: everybody that's watching. Don't forget to like, subscribe, be an outlier. And we'll see you guys later.
2396.76s: Yeah. Thanks Eric. You'll see you again.
