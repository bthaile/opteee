0.00s: Do you know the answer to this question up here?
2.28s: It is pretty simple.
3.48s: This is called put skew.
4.84s: And the reason why it exists
6.68s: is because market participants typically are willing
8.76s: to overpay for downside protection.
11.60s: Now, markets are pretty smart.
14.00s: So you can also find instances where there's call skew,
18.00s: but more often than not in general,
20.88s: you're gonna see put skew.
22.24s: And this is simply because in order for somebody
24.60s: to logically take the other side of that trade,
27.24s: where markets tend to take the elevator down,
30.04s: the stairs up, meaning there's velocity.
32.28s: And that's where your risk direction is,
35.04s: and it's unlimited compared to your profit potential,
37.76s: which is limited.
39.80s: It doesn't create a super great risk profile in general,
43.32s: and that's why there's a premium typically in puts.
46.24s: Again, it's not always the case,
47.48s: but more often than not, you'll see it that way.
49.76s: But once you get sensitive to this idea of skews,
53.16s: you can actually look for where markets
55.36s: are pricing in the direction of things.
58.04s: Be an all-air sealer.
