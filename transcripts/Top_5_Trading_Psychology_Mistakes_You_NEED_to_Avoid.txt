0.12s: adal we have enemy ships in SE 27 it's a
4.12s: trap you heard it from the man here
6.76s: first it's a trap uh that's kind of the
9.32s: nature of our brains with respect to
11.84s: trading there are a lot of traps that
14.04s: are very easy to find your way into and
17.16s: we all will experience these to
18.60s: different degrees now one of the main
20.04s: things is to do your best and learn from
23.76s: these potential circumstances before you
25.60s: go through them yourself so that you
27.36s: have a little bit of an idea before you
29.68s: get too far into the weeds so cognitive
33.48s: biases believe it or not we as human
36.96s: decision makers are literally riddled
40.60s: with cognitive biases these are just
42.36s: some of them from my website you can pop
44.12s: on go look through at your leisure but
46.64s: there are some of these that are really
48.64s: really dangerous so things like the
51.76s: disposition effect is one that you have
54.20s: to be aware of this is where we have a
56.28s: tendency to cut winning trades too short
58.12s: and let losers run which is CPL with
60.40s: something called loss aversion
63.04s: confirmation bias is another really
65.52s: really important one this is where we
68.16s: focus more so on information that
70.36s: confirms what we want to see and not
72.68s: what the objective reality might be
75.96s: hindsight bias really important
78.20s: hindsight bias is when things seem ever
81.64s: so clear when we're looking at stuff in
83.96s: the rearview mirror meaning stuff that
85.52s: has happened before and I have a video
88.20s: that goes through all of these way more
89.92s: more in detail we're not going through
91.24s: one by one you have to be aware of these
93.56s: that's what it boils down to you have to
95.08s: be aware of the presence of each and
97.08s: every one of these because they have
98.64s: ways to slowly siphon money away from
100.96s: you or to lead you into making really
104.48s: poor decisions in a really short-term
106.92s: time frame so the main fix here is to
110.16s: conduct a landscape analysis what I mean
112.16s: by this is to take a look at how Traders
114.72s: tend to behave and tend to perform and
116.96s: you'll actually see in a little bit I
118.40s: have a bunch of examples from places
119.68s: like reddit reddit is not my favorite
122.48s: place to learn about trading but it
125.56s: definitely is my absolute favorite place
128.08s: to learn about the experience of Traders
131.12s: because you're going to come across a
132.48s: wide gamut of it and a lot of them will
134.88s: be unfortunately unsuccessful but
137.12s: there's a learning point for you in
139.40s: every single one of those instances you
141.92s: also can Implement things like external
144.44s: audits this is when you ask a friend to
146.88s: take a look at what you're doing and if
148.68s: you're part of our Discord Community is
150.68s: completely free to join you can always
152.68s: ask another Trader in there that's why
154.56s: I'm built the community for you as a
157.52s: resource for Traders among one another
159.60s: to connect with other quality people
161.52s: that are genuinely interested in some of
163.36s: the same stuff and finally the way you
166.16s: can identify a lot of these things is if
168.52s: you track what you're doing because we
171.28s: have a really faulty memory when we're
174.40s: trying to remember what we did why we
176.88s: did it so if you're taking notes as
178.64s: you're doing things all of of your
180.08s: different cognitive biases they're all
181.88s: going to Bubble Up you're going to see
183.12s: them clear as day and then you can
184.76s: create controls to make sure that you're
188.40s: analyzing things objectively that you're
191.24s: examining things holistically from an
193.40s: objective bias as compared to just
196.40s: trying to confirm what you want to see
198.40s: the next one here is called Good Old
200.64s: Goldilocks analysis this is the
203.28s: propensity for Traders and people in
206.00s: general to either not suff ently and
210.72s: objectively analyze themselves or in
213.92s: Endeavor what they're doing in
215.24s: individual trade all of those things
217.40s: this is why a lot of times let's use a
219.52s: basic example if somebody says hey how
221.52s: long is it going to take you to get
222.56s: ready people will say oh it take me 5
224.48s: minutes and then 15 minutes later
226.40s: they're still not there you're like what
227.56s: the hell's going on that's Goldilocks
229.32s: analysis they think they're going to
230.44s: move a lot faster than they actually do
232.88s: this translates to trading in a lot of
235.00s: really nefarious ways but this is where
237.32s: we spend way more time looking at what
239.96s: we think we want to see happen in a
242.04s: trade as compared to what might actually
244.12s: happen in a trade so let's take a look
246.36s: at an example of that right here so we
248.80s: can see that this is from a while ago on
251.80s: Theta gang and we have this person that
254.28s: got ass sign on Arc down 50% what now so
258.28s: they sent a bunch of cash secured puts
261.12s: and they got assigned on some shares
262.56s: they were waiting for a time to wheel it
264.52s: and they're down 15% from their entry
267.20s: this goes back to that loss aversion
269.40s: thing I was telling you about there's a
270.64s: lot of issues that you can pick apart
272.52s: from this thing but the really
274.76s: interesting thing about this is you can
276.28s: tell when they first entered this trade
278.48s: the only thing they're considering is
280.04s: what they were making from those cash
281.60s: secured puts they clearly did not
283.76s: consider this side of the trade and for
287.60s: their question of how do I avoid this in
289.28s: the future you analyze both sides of the
293.16s: trade you don't just analyze the side of
295.96s: the trade that you're interested in that
297.48s: you want to see happen that's a primary
299.36s: driver of what you see here the next
301.68s: thing Detachment from your trading
304.28s: Capital these instances are really
307.32s: interesting and there's a couple ways we
309.96s: can overcome this and this is a
312.20s: nefarious nefarious thing so Detachment
315.04s: from Trading Capital allows us to cope
317.80s: with losses and you can see that that's
319.76s: a problem for a lot of people here's the
321.88s: deal when you put in your hard-earned
324.80s: money into your trading account it takes
327.28s: you weeks and you can literally count
329.96s: the hours of time hourly income that it
333.16s: took for whatever you lost if you don't
337.20s: control this sensation of when you're
340.08s: moving money from your regular bank
343.04s: account into your trading account and if
344.64s: you don't control the sensation where
346.32s: it's like oh I just lost 40 hours worth
349.28s: of my money or whatever the case is
351.64s: you'll never fully be able to detach
353.68s: from the capital so one of the things
355.60s: that I do is the money that goes into
358.00s: the trading account while I have zero
359.96s: intention of losing it I will mentally
362.96s: assign it as gone and I actually think
365.28s: that's a very important process because
367.36s: we can look at somebody that really has
369.80s: done a great job at this and they are
372.28s: one of my favorite people to take a look
374.52s: at what they're doing dfv AKA roaring
376.80s: Kitty and we looked at a bunch of his
378.84s: different trades and his account has
380.72s: gone through massive changes and it's
382.64s: because you'll notice that these are
384.48s: YOLO Updates this is because it's very
387.00s: likely he set up a separate account to
388.72s: be really risky with his money and
391.28s: mentally detached from the capital
393.12s: that's how he's able to watch it EB and
395.28s: flow
396.72s: $160,000 in a day as compared to up
400.04s: $130,000 the day before and then
401.92s: eventually this scolls into million most
403.88s: of us if we were up 1.5 million we would
406.20s: take that down in an instant and move on
408.32s: forever meanwhile the next day because
411.64s: he didn't unwind there he was up $7
413.76s: million that's the point so the way that
417.12s: we overcome our ability to let trades
419.92s: and systems work is by giving them time
423.00s: space and room to move and mentally
425.80s: decoupling ourselves from the money that
427.80s: goes into it the other thing is through
430.24s: exposure therapy the way that works is
432.96s: let's say that you're you think $100 is
435.68s: a lot of money still and you put on a
437.68s: trade you lose $100 and it's really
439.40s: really painful the way that you slowly
441.48s: get over that is maybe you put on a
443.16s: trade that's a little bit smaller that
444.56s: maybe loses up to 80 bucks and then you
447.32s: slowly ratchet that up as you get more
449.76s: and more comfortable with the size of
452.20s: the trades that you see that builds up
454.28s: over time okay next one false
456.00s: attribution this one's really really
457.88s: really tricky false attribution is where
461.28s: we have a tendency to not holistically
465.32s: capture what went on or the thought
468.32s: process behind something and the reason
470.56s: why this is so nefarious is because it
473.16s: can lead us to making changes based on
475.96s: something that's not the actual primary
477.84s: driver of a problem and there's a few
479.96s: really really easy ways to get over this
481.84s: but let's take a look this person says
483.80s: greed is one hell of a drug they say
485.56s: I've been scalping spy for a few weeks
487.68s: I've been profitable almost every day
489.28s: but it's always greed that gets me I
491.12s: have a target of 500 a day been up 2,000
493.20s: only to lose it on a trade it be down
494.68s: like 400 bucks so they're attributing
497.00s: this to Greed but is this actually greed
501.64s: it's certainly seems like there's an
503.12s: element to it but the problem is is that
505.04s: if this person thinks it's greed and
506.56s: only greed they're probably not
508.12s: capturing some of the important details
510.80s: that I can pick up from this from actual
513.24s: positive attribution of what's going on
514.88s: here one of them is I can tell you that
516.64s: they don't have a written plan because
518.36s: if they did this short circuits
521.24s: essentially all of this if you have a
522.92s: plan that you really trust and you just
524.68s: want to deploy that plan then this
526.84s: sensation goes away the other thing I
529.08s: can tell is that there's no risk
530.40s: management plan to the downside because
532.40s: if we're worried about making $500 a day
534.76s: up $22,000 to allow that $2,000 to turn
538.20s: into down $400 tells us we have an issue
541.12s: managing risk to the downside that's
542.76s: also loss of version which we learned
545.00s: from the first cognitive bias overview
546.84s: section so the point is we need to at we
549.28s: need to dig deeper we can't just stop at
551.16s: a superficial answer and say okay greed
553.32s: is one hell of a drug I'm sure that
555.04s: that's a a a part of what we see here
557.40s: but then we have to ask why is greed one
559.08s: hell of a drug here because I want to
560.44s: make more money why and so on and so
562.44s: forth you'll start to illuminate way way
565.60s: way more details about your process as
567.64s: compared to what seems to be a smart
571.16s: superficial answer the reason why I say
573.16s: smart is because you're taught not to be
574.72s: greedy you're taught to take profits
576.52s: fast in all of these kinds of things but
578.88s: it might not actually be the plaguing
581.40s: issue underneath and it can lead you
582.96s: down the wrong path last thing UND
585.16s: disiplined approach this is super easy
587.68s: you need to have Trader documentation
589.80s: and I have videos about all of this but
592.12s: this simply comes down to doing the work
594.28s: before you ever place a trade and fun
596.44s: fact that's where all the work is done
598.76s: if you go through the process of
600.64s: outlining what you're trying to do
602.12s: before you do it you're quantifying
603.72s: things you can avoid this really really
606.56s: dangerous dangerous path so we have an
608.72s: example here where somebody's saying is
610.92s: should I sell the option or exercise
613.28s: guess what this person should define
616.56s: this before they get into the trade just
618.68s: as this person should have defined what
622.40s: their exit point would be in the unhappy
626.40s: path meaning avoiding Goldilocks
628.28s: analysis in the unhappy path of the
630.36s: trade going against us we should Define
632.64s: where we would get out the problem here
636.36s: is not having a clear plan in place if
639.60s: you go through that ahead of time you
641.40s: short circuit literally all of this so
644.88s: these are five of the most impactful
648.00s: psychological traps that impact not just
650.48s: individual repetitions and actions but
653.68s: the entire path of a Trader as always if
656.36s: you have any questions or anything you
657.80s: want me to do a video on let me know in
659.48s: the comments be an outlier I'll see
661.04s: youall later
