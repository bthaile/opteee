0.00s: What's up everybody? So as you could tell it is me alone and unafraid today
8.32s: But I still wanted to make sure that we're kind of keeping the cadence
13.20s: Unfortunately Newton was busy today, which I mean the man has family is stuff to do
18.96s: I totally understand but he and I were gonna connect back up next weekend
23.50s: So for the session today what I wanted to do is use it is a little bit more of
29.84s: Learning session for me and hopefully to understand more of what you guys are looking at how you're receiving and thinking about the information
38.56s: And then obviously if there's
40.24s: Questions that you guys have one I would do my best especially if it's options related and stuff
45.60s: Yeah, I can handle that no problem
47.36s: But if there's questions that you guys have or ideas that I don't know about
50.56s: I'm gonna keep it a buck with you and I'll tell you I have no idea
53.04s: And then but what I can do is keep those in my back pocket for when we have this session with Newton next weekend
58.72s: Because he and I we we text most days a little bit here and there at least so I can always run some of the stuff by him as well
66.48s: And ask him to cover some of the questions and want his videos. He's awesome, right? So
73.04s: I just wanted to be super super clear that I have a very limited knowledge about the subject the goal for today is to learn more about it
81.60s: And also to hang out with you guys. I find the more I hang around the ape community the
87.36s: Really that the happy R.I.M. I think overall
92.24s: I have to be honest
93.76s: I've been in markets for a while and I've already mentioned this before but it's not super
101.36s: It's not super frequent where I come across elements of markets that are like
105.68s: Generally foreign to me and this is that in a lot of ways a lot of the things that you all are looking at are
112.88s: highly highly unique to the ape community to the game stock community which is very cool to me
119.68s: because I've said this before
122.00s: If you look at other kinds of market participants and you ask them like hey explain to me what a FTD is or explain to me the concept of an ETF creation and redemption cycle like
134.64s: They won't know that most people don't know that stuff
137.84s: And that's been one of the cool things from my perspective is I'm getting an opportunity to learn more about that stuff with you guys
144.40s: So overall that's the goal of the session
146.72s: So I have a handful of things on my docket that I specifically want to cover and learn more about
152.80s: and then
154.08s: We can dive further into whatever offshoots you guys have
157.52s: So I would ask that if there are like specific resources specific reddit posts
164.16s: Anything like that that you think is useful for us to take a look at or for me just to help me understand more about the story
169.76s: I would love it and please throw that in the chat
172.16s: So the first thing I want to start with though
174.80s: is
175.76s: Just taking a closer look at
178.40s: The Andrew left case and citron research
181.52s: Then I want to take a look specifically at there is a video
186.96s: brought up to me by roaring kitty about like a spreadsheet that he uses like his tools
192.32s: I think it was in this yeah, so
196.16s: They mentioned that he has like this really intricate series of tools that he uses
202.32s: So I want to take a look at that
204.80s: And then I want to talk a little bit about chewy
208.32s: Because there's a lot of conversation around the movement of capital between those two positions and obviously they're very interesting to me
216.00s: So those are the main topics I have and then like I said we'll go left right wherever
221.52s: else you guys you guys take me so
224.88s: Welcome and I'm stoked to spend some time
228.08s: Looking at game stop learning more about I gotta say hello to everybody Joe says is it starting now?
232.88s: It is yeah, that's that's actually what this is it's a great question
236.96s: Zach says how believable do you think most of the dd on reddit is I want to believe it but I'm not sure
243.20s: As much as I love Newton every big jump over the past few months has a clear arcade catalyst. Yeah
249.04s: So this is a great question and again, I want to be abundantly clear
255.52s: I'm not the authority on any of this stuff right so I'm gonna share what I can from my background in trading in just my
263.28s: Market analysis, but I do not pretend to be the oracle on any of this stuff when I look at a lot of the due diligence on reddit
272.16s: I see a mix of things
274.16s: I see a lot of people trying to solve a really difficult puzzle
280.72s: I also see a lot of people scouring
286.08s: All ends of available information to come up with ideas
291.84s: I also see a lot of overfitting I see a lot of pattern seeking
298.72s: I see a lot of oversimplification
302.32s: I see a lot of cognitive bias that comes out in a lot of the analysis that I see and it's not because it's gamestop analysis
310.32s: It's because it's human analysis and it's being conducted by a lot of people that are trying really hard
316.24s: And they're coming across a lot of great pieces of information
320.32s: But I do think a lot of those data points you like let me put it this way
326.48s: I haven't found at least yet and it might be there
329.84s: But I haven't found like a comprehensive piece of due diligence
335.20s: That I follow it all the way through and I'm like yeah, okay. This is connecting some serious dots for me
342.48s: each piece of dd that I read it adds
346.72s: Puzzles that I can fit into the whole picture right like so if I'm trying to
351.84s: Finish a puzzle
353.12s: I can get a couple pieces from this one a couple pieces from this one a couple pieces from this one
357.52s: And that that's literally just because not only is the system highly complicated, which I think we've talked about
363.84s: But there's an even bigger reason than that and it stems a lot from the fact that we're dealing with
371.52s: A system where people don't follow the rules
375.36s: And again like we can clearly see that and the reason why that matters is because that's happening
381.76s: How can you solve a problem set like that
385.44s: With standard analysis per say
390.24s: And you know that you're kind of playing a game where the other counterparties aren't
396.96s: Really following the rules
399.44s: So it makes it really complex, I think so the short synopsis of that specifically your question Zach
407.52s: um
408.96s: I think a lot of it is very believable
411.20s: I think almost every piece of dd on there has tons of great data and believable components to it no doubt
418.80s: Do I think that they are fully comprehensive and fully depict what we're looking at now? I don't
425.60s: And more over than that and I talked to Newton about this actually because there's another thing I think is going on
432.00s: Which is who doesn't want to be the one to get it right and I think that that incentivizes people on places like
440.88s: Superstong or GameStop and that's actually another question I have for you guys
445.68s: I'm trying to
447.28s: I'm trying to understand more about the differentiation between these communities
452.16s: Because I actually don't fully I don't fully grasp that and again
456.08s: I'm coming at this from in
458.64s: Outside of perspective. I'm trying to learn
460.64s: So if I say anything in the process of this that is offensive or um sounds ignorant
465.20s: It is because I'm highly ignorant on the topic
468.40s: I don't actually understand this like why are these two different places not
474.48s: like
475.60s: Joined because everything that I can see
478.96s: From Superstong
480.48s: Seems to be about GameStop and I see that that's in the description here
484.72s: And I think Newton explained a little bit about the breakoff between
489.76s: Superstong
491.04s: From Wall Street bats so that part I get to a degree I think
495.76s: But this one I don't fully understand
499.52s: And the other thing is I don't actually know who came first. I guess
503.68s: Is there a way for me to see that here?
505.92s: So Ruta Biggest says divergencies. Okay, so it's just slightly different
510.48s: slightly slightly different perspectives on what they can focus on
514.24s: Eric what up Eric Eric says usually people banned from Superstong head over to GME okay got it
520.00s: That's helpful
521.52s: so
522.80s: And then gravittarius says I've noticed Superstong is a bit more hardcore interesting
528.64s: I also wouldn't have guessed that
530.64s: So that's really helpful context for me. So I appreciate it. Thank you
533.84s: Yeah, I was just trying to understand how these two communities operated in conjunction with one another
539.12s: Because they both have really interesting data sets what I like to do in here what I'm trying to like learn more about this stuff as I just go into the top post of all time
548.16s: and see
550.64s: What we have
552.16s: So this is
554.48s: That's interesting
557.68s: And this is another interesting component that I find is that like there is just a universal
563.76s: hate towards this homie which makes sense to be clear that that also doesn't surprise me at all
569.84s: Zack says there's also one called D.F.V. I've seen the D.F.V. one that one looks to be a little bit different in tone at least as far as I could tell
579.68s: but
581.20s: Yeah, it looks like
583.20s: It looks like the what I could see across these two communities. There's a lot of similarities right like literally this
588.80s: The top handful of posts or from the homie D.F.V.
592.32s: And then we just immediately go to essentially hating this dude which is awesome
597.04s: I love that
598.08s: And that's another thing that I was talking to about with Newton is I think it's awesome that there's just this very distinct common enemy
606.32s: I always love me a good common enemy
608.48s: It's the greatest when people with all different backgrounds can unite and just hate one person or one thing that
615.04s: Objectively probably is not super great. It's awesome big fan
619.20s: So yeah, this is one of the things I was noticing all right, so back up to Zach
624.72s: I think that was as much of the the question is at least as far as I can I can think of right now
630.56s: Jonathan says have you seen a decal single deep dive PNL?
633.60s: That was actually a question I was gonna have for you guys because I personally have not
637.76s: And I think it's because there's a lot of elements and I think a lot of people really really really want to be the person that solves it
644.96s: And what that means is if you're trying to do that it becomes like how many darts can you throw at the dart board and how many of them will stick
652.40s: Right and I made a comment about that in the gm e video I did yesterday where
657.92s: people are incentivized to guess a lot because I can tell you what will happen
663.60s: Is as soon as one person guesses a meaningful portion of this correct that's all that they will care about
672.48s: And the preceding track record of you know x number of missed guesses doesn't matter anymore
677.60s: And I'm not saying whether it should or shouldn't but
680.56s: It's just how kind of the human brain works with stuff like this which I can't help but find kind of kind of interesting
688.24s: I
690.24s: Um, I'm just catching up on the chat to see if there's anything else
696.48s: Mike says hi, what up Mike? Good to see you
699.60s: All right, let me get back up here
703.44s: Money thinks says Ken Griffin is a fraud him and his currently manipulate and take advantage of back door policies
708.40s: Yeah, I and again to me I really try to avoid being too hyperbolic and stuff
714.48s: But I cannot but I cannot help but see the same thing there
719.84s: So one of the things I notice about oh first let me actually we can do that
730.08s: So there's two things I want to share with you guys if you guys haven't seen it
733.04s: There's a video that I was going to share this one is it's kind of long
738.80s: But it's a it's a really really good video that I think is worth your time, which is this one
745.36s: This one is about FTDs if you guys haven't seen this
750.08s: I assume pretty much I'm probably the last person on earth to to have come across this with you guys
754.88s: But if if that's not the case, I think you guys should take a look at this because this dude does just an absolutely fantastic job
763.44s: Of describing this process of FTDs naked short selling and stuff like that if you guys want to go through this in a little bit
771.12s: I am very very happy to do that
774.96s: So
776.16s: Let's focus on a couple starting points here. I guess
781.44s: One of the things that I wanted to do was actually start with one of these older roaring kitty videos
787.68s: because this was shot in
790.64s: quite a bit earlier and
793.28s: I think so I was going through his old videos and one of the things that I find fantastic and
799.60s: Super disenfranchising at the same time
801.92s: Is that he has 85 videos and like a million subscribers, which is I mean, it's a joke
807.04s: It's awesome the dude is awesome and he should have every single one of those. Well, I'm not subscribed. We just got to turn that off
815.68s: anyways
817.84s: We I love this and one of the funny things is when I look at this stuff
824.40s: it's like
826.00s: I was looking at the views and I can see the stuff that you guys cared a lot about and then the things that didn't really hit the rickter scale
834.56s: Which I also found that pretty interesting. I wanted to ask about some of this
840.32s: But anyways, this is the video I wanted to start with
843.60s: So
847.76s: I'm going to pause this I'm going to make sure that you guys can hear it through here
851.60s: A quick admin note youtube sometimes can be really weird about
856.56s: A copyright infringement which I don't care like if that happens he it doesn't matter to me in terms of like ad revenue
862.48s: Like I don't even put ads in for this right there's a thing right now for youtube that says focus on your live stream and let youtube insert ads
869.04s: We're in I literally always dismiss it
871.04s: But anyways all that is to say that the that I think youtube looks at this stuff really carefully
875.76s: So if the stream cuts I essentially just have to turn this off and then they'll turn the stream back on
881.84s: I've had that happen with I during the apple vision pro thing I was looking at it
889.12s: And essentially that happened so if we cut out for a second that's what's going on just a quick heads up
893.76s: But I want to watch through some of this now
896.96s: For you guys if there's specific pieces in here or elements of this that you want us to focus on let me know
903.28s: When I was listening to this I there was a couple things that I've really found interesting
908.32s: And this is just from a background perspective right so
911.52s: I know that he has a little bit of a financial background
914.88s: And I know that he started out his journey as a very very heavy heavy
921.44s: Value investor
923.44s: Which is interesting to me and
927.20s: When I look at this
929.68s: I I can see how that starts
931.68s: But then he talked about some of this stuff in here about his movement
936.00s: From value investing which I thought was super interesting
938.96s: so
940.16s: I typically listen to things at two times speed
942.40s: I think that that might be a little too fast for some people for the uninitiated it might sound just like gibberish
948.88s: so maybe I'll do like
952.48s: Like one and a half and see
955.28s: How you guys feel about one and a half
957.76s: Because obviously it's a two hour video. We're not going to get through the whole thing
960.72s: I want to kind of find through a couple different spots. Are you the main ones? Okay
965.76s: So the three let's see if I can show each one quickly without diving teacher
969.28s: I'm secretly excited about this
972.16s: What happens is what gets pulled into the universe tab is only the latest iteration of a particular company
976.40s: No, right? So that's why I have to have data there not time usually. I don't think I'm gonna make more than one submission per day
980.56s: I just come to the DB and edit it there
982.72s: So what he's talking about here is super cool and I love this
985.52s: It's it's actually kind of similar to what I do, but it's a different
989.28s: Approach
990.24s: But he has kind of individual data components. It seems that he's aggregating up
996.08s: To a very specific view that he wants to co-late and have data in one spot super efficient makes it ton of sense
1003.92s: So that's why you're always going to have a few on the universe that's only getting the latest version that's gonna be
1006.24s: Do you look at yours? I think more and more it's and then something something tracking are
1009.76s: I get into it on some tab but um it is and so the way this should work like this is what I'm so I've worked with
1015.04s: I've worked with some serious
1016.08s: Developers in the past like legitimate badass programmers. They've like each rent like millions of lines of codes
1021.04s: And um and so in spreadsheets someone you may look at this by that's kind of nice right but like in my mind
1024.64s: I think of I think these these two guys in particular who are looking at this that they're like all right
1027.76s: Yeah, that's pretty basic stuff and anyway what I'm doing here is can just be done so much more simply and efficiently
1032.24s: Elsewhere, but this is how I do in spreadsheets and I from me it's really helpful in
1035.92s: That's another funny thing that he's talking about here. I couldn't agree more with him
1040.24s: Just from the idea of doing this stuff in spreadsheets
1042.72s: Also, I want to make sure the audio is coming through for you guys when I'm playing this
1046.16s: Let me know um if there's any audio issues from his side now one of the things that I agree with him on just from a broader trading
1053.92s: Perspective is the idea of using spreadsheets. I still use them. I can automate way more of what I do if I so choose
1059.92s: But you'll find that there's a lot of traders in my case that have kind of do this as like our our primary
1067.52s: Income source right?
1068.96s: We try to remain close to the information and if you're not at the institutional level that's moving just massive size
1076.56s: Where you're literally prohibited from being that close to the data. I find some
1082.72s: Very very commonalities between us where we like to manually input what we can
1088.80s: But we automate a lot of the inputs as well
1091.36s: So it's kind of a mix between still a manual process and
1096.40s: Automated but like the overwhelming majority of friends that I have that are in this business with me
1101.60s: They do the same thing they use spreadsheets
1104.16s: All right back to this
1106.16s: And if um and hopefully you might be able to do this some stuff if you care if you care
1109.36s: I like to think you're watching this video you care, but I don't know so I do care
1113.12s: Okay, so let's go let's go to submit tab um and submit tab is where I'll submit to the database um
1118.80s: So let's say so when I first of all anything below this black line
1122.56s: So he's just kind of talking about his approach on how he's filling in information
1128.08s: This all makes sense to me
1134.08s: I'm just skipping through to see the pull up and I'm spreadsheet. I just want everything ready for me
1137.28s: And some tags of the example I was getting tied or tied in the same shit over and over again
1140.72s: So I wanted uh, yeah, what's this a script that I found and um using my was complimenting I think it's just either on Google form
1146.32s: I think it was Google forms not exactly for like it doesn't matter both the right but watch this if I get wrong
1149.04s: So like that run anything up there. It's just most of that rickidates but never
1152.00s: But this actually does fuck show sidebar. Let's check this out
1155.12s: Most of it
1157.36s: So this looks like mostly about just data input
1160.40s: Yeah, not great. So it's so dumb and then so now it's in there and I just uh nice roll over
1165.12s: Well, I got a scroll because this is open but you know I don't really scroll it's me just x out and I click some in and watch this
1168.64s: Oh, and now it should it should submit it over and then clear out this mid and then should it should clear out that whole
1173.52s: Uh, blue row um that one that part of the script takes a little bit time to run some let's go check on the DB
1177.28s: We should see what he down the bottom there it is
1179.76s: Yeah, that's super cool. So
1182.32s: This he's over viewing a general approach he has to inputting the data
1187.36s: Zach says if we type in the URL at the top can we go to his spreadsheet? No, I doubt it because
1192.88s: That's where he's accessing his spreadsheet and more likely than not
1199.28s: You will not have access to it because it's going to be probably on his Google Drive
1203.60s: And unless he externally shares it like under his own volition it uh it won't be available to you
1210.40s: All right, I gotta stand up for a second for those that don't know your boys working with a uh fresh herniated desk
1216.24s: So we got to move around a little bit keep these hip flexors nice and loose
1220.80s: Oh as I just get this really fun random pain that starts shooting around it's kind of like a fun game
1227.28s: I I like to see where it goes
1231.04s: And how debilitating it is
1233.20s: You
1237.92s: Which is moderately so
1240.64s: All right
1241.92s: Let's take a look at some of the the chat here
1244.00s: Obviously, I'm happy to go through this as much as we want if we want to move on as something else we can
1247.60s: You guys let me know right now. I'm just kind of getting a sense of how he analyzes information
1252.00s: That's what I'm personally deriving from this
1255.76s: Uh, Rolando says hello. Yo, what up? Rolando good to see you
1260.00s: Um, Rolando says I have a question about buying calls on ETFs
1264.00s: I'm thinking on iwm sep or no slightly at the money. Yeah, what about it?
1268.96s: Obviously we can take a look at that
1271.60s: No problem
1273.12s: Running D. Jen says hope you recover. Okay, Scott says rough. Hope he heals. Yeah, you and me both. I gotta be honest with you
1279.92s: It's uh, it's not any big surprise especially after a bunch of time in the Marine Corps you'd kind of beat the shit
1286.08s: Out of the out of your body
1287.76s: So it does not surprise me, but uh, yeah, you know, you know it goes gotta gotta rehab
1294.40s: I'm still super super active
1295.92s: So this one I think was from training just like uh, like lifting somebody to slam them
1300.72s: But I did it in such a way that the body was a little tired. So yeah, that's enough about me nobody cares. I don't care
1309.04s: So let's take a look through the rest of this
1312.40s: So
1313.36s: So this is all general value. He said something in the beginning. I think I might have skipped it. Let me go back
1320.32s: The three let's see if I can show you each one quickly
1322.40s: That Lauren says Ben from the knees. Yeah, unfortunately, that's that like really old bad gouge
1328.40s: Because a lot of a lot of the reason why people start to have herniated disc unlike people like me because it me
1334.32s: It's it's a completely different uh a completely different reason right like people that end up generally herniating discs or if
1341.52s: They're not in good shape and they actually don't bend over their back and stuff and they become too rigid
1348.32s: People like me. It's a little bit more of just overuse and impact right like I still lift every day train most days
1356.72s: So yeah, I mean you're gonna have injuries. That's the South as shit goes
1361.12s: Um
1364.32s: Max says would you care to plug the software you trade with why you choose it over others? Yeah
1368.40s: I use thinkorswim. I mean, it's not really much of a plug. That's it in the background
1372.88s: And we can take a look through this you know if you guys are interested at all
1376.48s: But I I use it because thinkorswim's a good platform. That's really the the punchline
1385.28s: Um
1386.64s: Let me play this real quick because I think there's something he says
1392.08s: To save a couple of clicks I hate scrolling to something I want to say well we'll talk about
1396.80s: Um
1398.00s: A powerful these bridges are after the fact like I don't consider them so powerful. They do you can just do a lot. That's all but um
1402.64s: I like to try to build them out so that I don't have to do as much work as you see
1406.72s: But anyway, let me get into it. Let me stop wasting your time. We'll get into the spreadsheets. We'll start with trackers
1409.60s: Spread sheet here. I you may have seen me mentioned that I
1411.68s: Most of the process is just tracking stuff and so I need a spreadsheet to facilitate that tracking
1416.00s: And that's this one so you there's a whole bunch of stuff in here. We'll spend most of our time
1418.56s: I think in this spreadsheet. I also have um
1421.60s: Also, can we give a quick shout out
1424.16s: To the fact that uh
1428.48s: Can we give a shout out to the fact that he has a white t-shirt and a white hat on
1433.68s: I can't have white clothing for more than like a week because apparently
1437.84s: I'm a fucking child and it always gets dirty somehow
1441.84s: I always think it's like a magnet for dust
1444.96s: So the fact that my boy is decked out in this white kit is inspiring to me another type of spreadsheet that is like
1451.36s: Six or seven of them in fact, I found a report time I get one two three four five six these types of spreadsheets where I analyze on the methods, okay?
1457.60s: And that's what this spreadsheet is and I'll show you this one this is where I'm analyzing
1461.36s: Um the business and I start a profitability and trying to realize everything to inform me. I don't have anything to values
1465.60s: I could do that work like might be I put together some formulas and forecasts what the value could be. I self-fuel it doesn't matter
1471.60s: And then there's the universe spreadsheet in the universe spreadsheet a little bit less exciting
1475.12s: It's kind of like meeting stuff and I submitted to my DB um and uh
1479.44s: I take notes on it and um yeah, so what are I showing you in just the universe some of the so you know
1483.04s: Well, let me just start with this spreadsheet. I think that makes the most sense and they're only drug connected
1486.08s: They're helping I can weird ways you'll see we'll just start with this spreadsheet and um
1490.00s: All right, so this let's start with
1492.16s: 3420 first I say 3500 I don't know sometimes it was like just one of that. It used to be like 2500
1496.08s: I started like the rest he had a really interesting
1500.96s: He had a really really interesting video. I wish I could find it. I don't know if it's in here or if it's somewhere else
1507.76s: um
1509.04s: But there is a video where he was talking about his approach
1515.20s: Thought it was in this
1517.04s: So anyways, I think it's in this video somewhere. I just don't know exactly where it's at
1520.80s: But here's what I remember he was talking about his basis as like oh it might have been like uh
1527.04s: Like how he does things there is one of them this is it
1531.92s: Hey, what's up everybody? I wanted to make a video about my investment style like a high level overview of my investment style
1536.48s: Because I feel like some people might join a
1539.28s: Lightroom expecting excitement or some bait creating hot stop tips or stuff like that and you're gonna be disappointed because it's not gonna be like that
1545.20s: I'll drop this bomb when you're ready to start. I'm a valium investor
1547.76s: And I feel like some of you are rolling your eyes now laughing at me your bastards
1551.12s: Just kidding. I don't care. It's whatever. I'll just say this. I'm not your traditional valium investor
1554.56s: And I jot it down a couple reasons why and um the first is I'm not in the can that things values have been underperforming
1559.28s: I actually think it's been tremendously successful over the past decade
1561.60s: So I think it's funny when I see those headlines is valued dead is valued dead is coming back and that
1564.96s: So this yeah, so this is it in this video he talks about the the origin of his value investing philosophy
1571.36s: And then between this and that spreadsheet video he actually starts talking about how he is like approach to value investing has changed
1580.64s: And he doesn't really think that highly of it is much anymore and he essentially was talking about
1586.40s: How he would find that he would go through this rigorous process of valuing something and then it just wouldn't happen
1591.36s: And I thought that that was really interesting for two reasons one
1594.88s: With his background and I honest I don't know how old is at this point is four years ago
1600.24s: He looks super young
1601.84s: But I also just aged terribly so that he might be the same ages me. I have no idea
1608.88s: But the I don't know how old is and I don't know how long he's been in markets
1613.20s: But I know that he's savvy
1615.44s: Even at this point this four years in point and I can tell by a lot of what he's doing obviously
1620.00s: The reason why I say that is because it surprises me to hear the evolution in his thoughts
1627.04s: Value investing essentially between this time frame. I to me. I just took that as somewhat noteworthy. I thought it was interesting
1636.08s: Coffee donut says is it a service connected injury. It's a great question. I you talked about my back
1641.44s: I think it's like something that probably started a while ago with general stress and strain and then I think it just came to
1647.92s: ahead really because the dude that I was picking up was pretty
1651.36s: fucking heavy to be honest with you
1653.36s: so yeah
1655.36s: um
1657.36s: Let's see
1658.72s: Ape of traits this area has unusual high options volume for short-term dates isn't it in the xrt ETF with gm
1666.16s: So a couple things I actually don't know what's in xrt anymore. Let's see because I think it recently changed
1675.12s: So let's take a look at
1677.68s: xrt holdings
1680.48s: because
1684.08s: Let me see
1691.28s: I have to download all the holdings. That's what I'm grabbing right now for you guys
1695.20s: Oh
1704.48s: Well, and then I'm just opening up the excel sheet cool
1710.64s: All right, so this is as of 25 July
1714.88s: So let's see what's in this bad boy first. Let's check out what gmme holding it has how much
1720.32s: So right now it's holding I assume this is shares. Yeah, okay
1727.76s: the
1730.32s: 164,000 shares
1732.32s: So it's just really not that much
1735.84s: So in this case
1738.32s: Big A saying should have pulled guard that is like the most offensive thing I've ever heard in my life
1744.64s: Oh god you and you know that too you know that that's gonna piss me off
1749.84s: I
1750.88s: Can't even deal with that
1752.96s: Now it wouldn't surprise me though if we see Craig Jones pulled guard with Gabi Garcia. I think that would be hilarious
1759.04s: But anyways, so this is holding
1762.08s: relatively small amount of
1765.36s: GameStop
1767.52s: So it's like 1.12% of the ETF. It's I'm using this as like a line for you guys so you could see
1773.76s: And then the other question is is Siri in here and Siri is not in here. I didn't think so
1781.36s: So no, Siri obviously would be in other ETFs, but oh shit. Siri is now listening to me
1788.00s: That's sketchy bro my phone literally started listening in it obviously. It's already already already listening
1794.32s: But yeah, okay, so I don't see that here
1799.76s: Fun fact
1803.52s: Adam says iwb we can take a look
1816.80s: Holdings
1821.84s: Detailed holdings iwb it's funny. I literally have all these downloaded already, but I don't know where they are
1829.60s: All right, let's see jamey
1832.08s: Damn it back up to the top. I hate that
1836.56s: So I'm just expanding all these so that I can see like what it actually is
1842.00s: Wait
1843.76s: Actually, I guess we literally could just filter by up here. That would be kind of nice because this way we can see
1850.08s: Both of them side by side
1854.00s: So let's
1855.84s: Get rid of that and then let's look at gme
1862.56s: I
1864.56s: Didn't know what gme d was
1867.68s: That's interesting
1869.68s: All right, so let's go back in here and let's grab just gme this time for real
1874.00s: And then let's grab cf series in here it is
1880.16s: So okay now I'm confused
1886.48s: How is this the case
1889.04s: So this is telling me that the it's a zero way
1894.16s: Notional values
1898.40s: How is it zero way is it am I just missing desmos here
1906.00s: Rital me that batman how does that make sense
1909.36s: I
1916.32s: Mean I get that it would be so small right so right now I'm looking at the holdings on this
1922.88s: here
1924.88s: And obviously it shows the weight
1927.76s: But like it just doesn't make sense because the weight on this is 0.01 percent
1934.16s: Like there should be a third or fourth decimal right because
1938.24s: The market value here is 2.4 versus 1.6 that's not that far apart
1943.76s: So like they should have a third decimal or fourth decimal if they need
1947.68s: But they just cut it at two so
1950.56s: The cliff notes of that is
1953.60s: They're both in here for sure
1956.16s: But this is obviously so so so so light weighted that they didn't include the the
1963.20s: Desmos which I mean I have to be honest with you. It's kind of annoying. I wish I wish they did
1972.40s: And GameStop is also very very small GameStop is 0.01 percent
1979.92s: So Scott Copeland says I guess it's weighted as a zero zero x yeah, but like I thought they would at least because
1986.56s: When I downloaded it from the website it says that this is like the detailed holdings right so like where's the fucking detail
1992.96s: I would like to be able to see the
1995.68s: I'd like to be able to see it
1997.20s: Ryan O'Ducks says 0.00 percent is tiny. Yeah, definitely. Well, it's okay. That's actually incorrect
2003.44s: So it's that means it's tiny as it relates to the underlying
2008.48s: But when you're talking about products like this I'm just different cheating right like I don't think you should draw the conclusion that
2014.16s: Linearly although I think in this case. It's not wrong. So
2018.80s: in this case
2020.40s: The because like for example, let me just give you a null the null example here is what if the
2027.36s: The ETF that it's in is massive absolutely massive
2032.40s: You can have something that's weighted really lightly, but still represent a large gross position
2038.24s: Again, this is not that I want to be clear. This is not that and I agree with you
2043.60s: Rhino duck, which is also I have to be honest one of the like
2047.68s: picturing a fucking Rhino duck is awesome. I don't know actually let's we have to look real quick
2053.12s: Should we run that through?
2055.36s: What do you think chat GPT something like that?
2058.80s: Let me see rhino duck
2061.68s: I just gotta see what they look like
2064.96s: Hey, they look kind of cool
2067.36s: In case you guys were wondering where our friend rhino duck is from
2072.32s: Is this thing which I like a lot but things pretty sick
2075.84s: Or like this little cute rhino duck like that one too
2080.00s: But yeah, so anyways the the punchline though is our friend rhino duck is spot on like these are very small
2086.56s: But they're not small just because it's a lightweight
2090.00s: Of the ETF. I just wouldn't draw that conclusion that would infer that it's small
2095.04s: Relative to this ETF of course, but it could still be a large gross position
2100.64s: In this case it does not look like much this I see 450k
2106.40s: On Siri shares and then 190 games up
2110.72s: So but that's the problem with this like redemption cycle
2115.28s: Is it's difficult. It's actually quite difficult to navigate for them
2121.60s: Um, I think we can kill this one
2124.00s: That's so funny. I just every time I see this I can't help but laugh
2128.40s: I wanted to revisit another part of this because there's been a lot of kind of follow on questions about it
2135.44s: It looks like we need to take a look at
2139.44s: Rhino duck and dally you guys got it give me one sec we'll grab some dally
2149.68s: Start chat okay create an image of a game stop inspired
2158.64s: Rhino duck
2163.76s: All right, see we get
2171.36s: Generating image
2178.80s: Oh wow, what do you guys think
2181.76s: This is like they need to combine it so we need to edit this and it needs to be an inspired combined
2192.72s: Rhino duck
2195.44s: Except maybe I need to spell combined right that might help
2205.84s: Well, that's a yo grino all right, let's see I didn't spell right that was that was my fault
2211.84s: Let's see
2216.08s: League says can you advise on my fantasy football team? I know jack shit whoa
2221.36s: About fantasy football look at this thing. I like this one
2225.52s: It still looks there this one's terrifying. I don't like this one
2228.96s: This one gets a thumbs down. I don't like that
2231.20s: This one I like because he has nice little feathers look at these little wings
2234.64s: I know that's another critter behind them
2236.96s: But I wish there is a little more duck going on
2240.00s: Rudevegas says first one is curse. Yeah, this one not not a fan. This one is not a fan at all
2244.56s: It's it's very nerve-racking all right. Let's run a little more time see what it comes up with and then we'll move on from this
2253.60s: Um
2255.36s: But yeah, League I know jack shit about football. I oh god these are
2262.00s: Oh my god
2264.56s: This
2266.56s: Looks like a mutant experiment this nestled
2270.56s: All right, let's let's try one more time. Let's try this one more time
2273.76s: So let's do game stop inspired duck with
2280.08s: a rhino
2281.84s: Head I think this might get us closer on to target
2285.44s: Because that I don't like the nestled duck underneath it sketches me out a little bit
2290.96s: That learns is it's a rhino mallard. Yeah, it did there we go. This is more what I'm thinking about
2297.04s: He's look good
2300.40s: I like these a lot these are good. All right. I am I'm pleased with this visual. I think that this looks
2307.52s: Uh good. I'll save this
2310.96s: So that we have that for our reference
2313.68s: Whatever we possibly need that as a reference, but we have it
2317.12s: That's the important part and nobody can take it from us. It is our reference
2323.04s: All right
2324.40s: Now back to this ETF thing there's a reality
2328.64s: behind this ETF
2331.12s: redemption and creation cycle
2334.24s: So this is something that Newton has been starting to track more and more and more if you guys don't know
2339.84s: Newton has this absolutely crazy
2344.00s: crazy GME sheet where he's tracking essentially everything so
2348.64s: I mean, I imagine all of you are familiar with this, but if you're not it's it's literally accessible to everybody and
2355.28s: There's just a ton of great resources in here
2358.64s: It takes a while to even figure out how to read it to be completely honest with you
2362.96s: But it's worth it's definitely worth your time if you're following this at all now
2368.24s: Again, this is a thing that he and I actually look at together quite often
2372.16s: And one of the things that I notice people do is they
2377.20s: I they focus too much on positive identification
2382.08s: And not enough on total correlation analysis
2386.64s: So
2387.84s: What I've been doing is downloading the sheet
2391.20s: So that I can run in a broader data set when I'm looking at things like FTDs
2397.12s: I'm looking at redemption cycles
2399.36s: And I'm trying to understand like the actual correlations
2403.36s: It's important in my opinion to be as objectively
2408.24s: Is humanly pot is objective is humanly possible
2412.08s: So what I mean by that is like some of the issues I see are like there are a lot of instances where there's like these weird off cycle movements
2420.08s: Meaning we might think that there's a tailwind of some sort or there might be some sort of crazy pop in ETF volume or something
2428.96s: But then it doesn't translate to anything so sometimes it does sometimes it doesn't and that's one of the
2436.64s: Really the the anomalies that continues to go in with this
2440.32s: So we take a look we and I again when I say we it's I am
2445.52s: Nothing in this story. It's almost all Newton
2449.76s: I'm just running broader data analysis on the back end because there's a lot of individual things that you can look at
2456.64s: That look really interesting to me
2459.68s: Uh, Ukraine says back to the topic bro. What topic is this not we're talking about game stop
2467.04s: Ukraine what should we be talking about um
2472.32s: But so he's starting to build out this here
2476.56s: So we're trying to get a sense um for all of these different ETFs and
2485.60s: The FTD cycles
2489.52s: This is creation and redemption
2492.32s: over here
2494.72s: So when I look at creation and redemption this is another relatively new piece of the puzzle again
2501.52s: Um Newton has a lot a lot of detail on this as is but there does seem to be some interesting correlations here
2509.20s: But again the issue that we have is that there are a lot of non flag events as well that happened
2516.08s: so I want to be
2519.04s: Yeah, I want to be really clear about that because as I'm analyzing these larger data sets
2525.04s: There's instances where you see like massive massive creation and redemption
2529.76s: But the other problem behind this is
2534.24s: There's it's not just limited to game stop
2538.64s: Right, that's one of the problems is
2542.64s: When we see creation redemption. It's not limited to just to just
2548.88s: This specific entity. So it's something to look at it's something to try to bake into the picture
2554.64s: I think just out of curiosity, but
2557.84s: I also don't think um, yeah, I don't necessarily I think there's a lot of noise is the way I should say that
2565.60s: Um
2567.12s: Let me see
2568.72s: Markets says can you talk about the upcoming
2572.00s: 16 all GME options who are bag holding yeah definitely
2575.28s: I
2577.28s: Can absolutely do that that is
2581.12s: I'm way way more well versed in that
2584.88s: Before we take a look at that though Marquette really quick. I just wanted to share a few studies with you guys
2591.04s: this one is really cool
2595.20s: So
2598.64s: Let me throw this in here. So these are all different papers
2603.04s: Share to ton with newton to include on like short squeezes gamma squeezes
2608.48s: This is how I analyze information is I'm looking for broad objective data sets that I can then integrate into my own data set
2616.56s: And try to learn if you don't like reading white papers. This will be terribly annoying for you
2621.36s: I recommend just dropping it into chat gpt
2624.24s: But when you do that stuff with chat gpt always ask it for what are the limitations of this research
2629.92s: Don't just say what what are the takeaways because if you just get the takeaways and you don't understand the limitations of the research
2636.64s: You're getting a highly skewed picture that I don't think is the best use of your time and effort. So yeah anyways
2644.56s: I wanted to share those with you guys before we moved on. Okay, so now
2649.28s: following up
2651.28s: with
2653.44s: Marquette asking about
2655.20s: 16 all GME options. Yes, we can do that
2658.40s: I guess maybe we could start with just a quick broad overview. I'll do a lot of this in the in kind of like my standard video update tomorrow
2665.04s: So we don't have to go super far in depth
2669.12s: Also, this is a Arnold Palmer absolutely fantastic big fan um but
2676.96s: right now
2679.60s: Right now as I look at the stock
2682.88s: It is
2685.84s: It's behaving strangely to me is what I think
2689.44s: And the reason why I say that is because the way that I'm noticing the volume coming through
2696.48s: and the percentage of sale to buy volume and the price behavior of the underlying is very weird
2703.84s: So what I mean by that is let me get my ugly face out of your way
2708.56s: So that you can see the volume down here clearly
2711.36s: And of a few things stick out to me one of them is notice all of the sale volume over the last
2720.00s: Essentially from the 17th of July
2723.12s: We did have one slightly favorable day on the 22nd and then one more on the 23rd but other than that
2729.44s: Mostly sale volume
2730.96s: So sale volume on the 18th on the 19th it was almost all sale volume the overwhelming
2737.52s: majority of volume that we saw that day literally was sale volume
2742.72s: and then
2746.32s: We see
2748.32s: On the 24th
2750.40s: majority sale volume yet again and then also here on the 26th
2756.32s: So the reason why I think that's weird is because price isn't necessarily cratering
2763.84s: As much as I would expect it to given that amount of sale volume
2768.96s: Now the total average volume is also being siphoned out heavily and there's a there's somebody sent me a theory that
2775.12s: I think we should take a look at in a few minutes
2777.52s: That I actually think it's really really important because they're starting at least some of the things
2784.40s: That I was told or I haven't looked it yet
2786.32s: But some of the things that I think are in there will will be slightly informative as we look at this
2791.12s: but
2792.40s: punchline I see on a chart highly highly range bound
2797.04s: and we are not necessarily
2801.20s: We're not making great headway here
2804.16s: I think we're at a bit of an inflection point here
2807.28s: And the reason why I think we're at a bit of an inflection point is because we're seeing a series of
2813.92s: higher lows
2815.44s: and thankfully we pivoted here
2818.64s: Otherwise we would have broke down into a downtrend like a fully confirmed downtrend
2823.44s: but this isn't
2825.28s: to
2827.28s: This doesn't look great still
2829.60s: And it's because we have the lower low here
2831.76s: higher lows higher lows higher lows we kind of hit a term high here
2836.00s: And it came back down it essentially started testing previous lower lows
2841.52s: And it's still hovering down here
2843.92s: So what I'm highlighting is just in standard technical analysis
2848.00s: Typically when something is in an uptrend
2850.40s: You'll see both higher highs and higher lows
2853.52s: You're going to expect to see lows that's normal but they're they're typically higher
2858.32s: If something is in an uptrend
2860.64s: This is starting to look to me something that's in very much a sideways trend
2865.76s: Like we are just grinding sideways here
2870.16s: So I think in this case the the price behavior is strange is really the the summary of that now
2878.40s: If we take a look at the options
2880.96s: There's a bunch that sticks out to me
2884.88s: The first thing I mean just take a look at the ally after expiration
2891.04s: After expiration on
2894.48s: Friday
2895.60s: We lost a ton of options as you would expect
2899.28s: But the call oh I right now is 569 gigity
2903.44s: And the put oh I is at 347
2909.60s: So
2912.40s: So from like in oh I skew perspective
2916.88s: I don't actually love this and the reason why I don't love this is because in my opinion
2925.36s: This is something that is very very much
2928.80s: starting now to
2930.88s: trend sideways and
2934.48s: The options are also
2937.92s: They're backing that idea which I don't love here
2940.88s: The reason why I say that is because I'm just I'm not seeing the massive
2945.84s: Option skew that we typically see when gme is really poised to start moving higher
2952.32s: So when I see these almost at a one to one that is fairly anomalous to what this looks
2959.04s: And I mean let's take the time right like we're in a live stream. Let's take a look at it together
2962.24s: Let's go back here to three may
2965.28s: And we'll go to on demand so that we can go back in time and then let's go to three may
2973.20s: And I just want to well, let's go to the second. Let's take a look at these options
2977.12s: Uh
2980.00s: Nick says
2985.36s: Uh, I'm missing
2989.36s: I'll take a look. Oh, I see you copy. So gme is tracking AMC 2021 May uh
2995.76s: I don't know if I would make those comparisons personally. I could see why somebody might do that
3001.12s: But I don't think it actually makes a lot of sense
3004.72s: We can talk about it, but
3007.52s: I wouldn't personally make that comparison
3010.88s: But this is what I wanted to show you guys
3014.32s: When games stop starting to get like really poised to move higher
3019.36s: Take a look at the disposition and the options before the move started
3024.08s: So this is this is still
3027.12s: When it was down grinding lower it created this
3031.04s: Look like short-term base at about 10
3034.40s: And then it was grinding a little bit higher
3036.32s: But it hasn't even made that breakout move yet to the upside the initial leg up
3041.12s: It hasn't made that yet
3042.80s: And if you take a look at the options
3045.12s: There's 414,000 calls
3048.64s: To 106,000 puts
3052.48s: So it's it's literally almost four times calls to puts
3058.24s: And this is before that move. This is why options are so informative
3062.80s: You can see a lot of information and options. It's how I caught this most recent move. It's how I traded the squeeze
3069.44s: Back in 2021 is through identifying stuff like this
3075.44s: So anyways
3076.88s: What I'm highlighting to you is before the move even started and even if you include
3081.52s: Roaring kiddie's position in here, which was 120,000 right
3085.84s: Take those 120,000 out of this it's still three times
3092.00s: Calls to puts
3093.68s: So massive massive callsque when this thing started wanting to make some pretty pretty meaningful
3101.12s: Movements up when I look at it now, right there's a there's much denser options
3108.72s: But they're also much more balanced
3111.52s: It's not even two to one at this point calls to puts it's contracted quite a lot
3117.36s: so now
3118.96s: Looking out at the
3121.20s: expiration cycle of choice which is 16 aug
3125.84s: And the reason why I think it's important to look out at 16 aug because two aug is really quiet
3130.48s: Nine aug is even more quiet still
3133.04s: 16 aug is the first chance we get a look at something that even offers something active
3138.48s: And I say this a lot to remind people
3141.36s: Because the monthly
3143.20s: Explorations are almost always going to be busier than the other
3148.00s: Explorations available to us and it's specifically from a liquidity perspective
3152.64s: This is very very common behavior. This is not anomalous in any stretch of the imagination
3158.16s: So I think it's just important to know
3161.44s: That this is
3163.68s: Overall I would consider it like generally standard fare essentially
3168.56s: We're at the
3173.12s: Raspberry lime spin drift big fan
3176.64s: I got to stop drinking on the onal Palmer because
3179.04s: It's black teaks the caffeine and we're coming up on 6 p.m. We're not about be we're not about that life
3185.60s: So when I look at 16 aug I see a few things
3188.48s: I see the very standard massive massive build out of options here at the
3194.32s: 125 and I continue to see this every single cycle
3198.48s: I this is actually something that I try and trade myself not the 125s, but the mispricing of the 125s and the rush of volume
3206.88s: It's something that I can actually see happening
3210.64s: And try to front run it a little bit
3213.04s: The other primary strikes that I see look like here. I'm going to guess these are the 30s. Yep
3219.12s: These look like the 40s
3221.60s: Yep, these look like 25s
3225.04s: Yes, these look like 20s
3227.52s: Yes, these look like 50s
3230.16s: What I'm highlighting is that this is standard human behavior
3234.24s: Where we pick the round numbers right? So there's a 15 to 16 to 17 and 18 19 20 20
3239.36s: So yeah, I can count believe it or not. I got a check. Do you see that? See that shit counted right there
3244.88s: No problem can do it
3246.88s: and
3248.24s: So when I look at this though, I can still see that that's where most people are
3254.08s: Really centralizing their options
3256.56s: Nighthams says 125 can't be retail. They did the mistake once trace three times. What else could it be? Oh no
3261.92s: I definitely think it's largely retail. Yeah
3265.84s: I wouldn't say that
3268.24s: It's all retail
3269.92s: This is also a place for institutions to get cheap hedging depending on what kind of trades they're putting on
3277.28s: But
3278.80s: This is yeah, I mean, it's pretty clear that like this is absolutely a mix of retail
3284.80s: The reason why it's so clear to me is because if you look at the transactions so many of them are one lots
3290.16s: And again like institutions
3292.40s: They're not going to use one lot. It's just so grossly inefficient for them to try to place those trades
3299.92s: So it just in order to build any sort of size that they would want
3303.84s: So
3305.84s: Yeah, I don't really think
3308.88s: Yeah, like I don't really think
3311.36s: It's not retail. I think it's a mix of retail and institutions for sure
3317.12s: But I would 100% argue back that it can be retail
3321.36s: There's probably a lot of them in there actually is based on the the purchasing behaviors that I see
3327.20s: Which we can actually validate a little bit
3330.72s: all right, I got a
3333.12s: Minimize some of these screens so realize I got like way too many windows open and I'm getting lost
3339.92s: Navigating between these windows. Oh, that didn't like that
3343.76s: So that we can turn off
3345.92s: This will take up close that all right, we're looking better here
3355.36s: This we need this we don't need
3358.80s: And then this is the post I'm going to work through with you guys
3363.36s: All right, great great great great. We're looking good
3368.00s: Here we go
3373.68s: All right
3375.84s: Let's see
3378.16s: If we take a look and the reason I'm using this is because there's well there's a couple other sources
3384.72s: I like using this one. I'm talking with you guys about it because I feel like it's easier for you guys to see based on this tool is compared to what I use
3394.00s: So yeah
3395.52s: Dust to dust what up does says I appreciate the unbiased like a gm. That's awesome
3399.60s: I'm I'm not gonna lie there was a couple instances where I've been talking about the stuff that I was kind of concerned
3404.96s: That like people might be upset to not hear always like just great stuff about what might be going on
3413.28s: But I've always really I mean that that's like the platform that I started the YouTube channel on right?
3418.08s: It's like the whole ideas finance with the bullshit
3421.12s: So my I say to everybody in a lot of the videos as well my goal really is not to spread hype or fide it's
3428.96s: To try and
3430.96s: present information for people to then synthesize on the room and figure out what they think of it and how it fits into their broader picture
3439.20s: I'm very very
3441.28s: personally invested into like the empowerment of individual traders
3447.84s: That's the basis behind it and
3451.84s: It's because like I feel
3454.08s: Trating is changed my life. I and I don't want to go into this whole fucking story in my background
3458.32s: But like unequivolously has changed my life. I grew up poor and now because of trading
3463.52s: I'm at a completely different echelon in my life. I literally retired my mom because I figured out how to do this shit
3470.24s: And it's a really powerful skill set once it's understood the problem is
3475.44s: So many instances people start trading like myself with really terrible terrible understanding of what they're getting into
3483.20s: And expectations and then it leads to people just losing tons of money unnecessarily
3487.68s: so one of my
3489.44s: Big objectives there is to try to put stuff out to slow people down from doing that like that's
3495.76s: There's a video that I have here and I'll I'll share it in here
3499.20s: Literally every single time I have an opportunity to share this video. I do and
3505.36s: The video is about buying call options smarter and that's literally exactly what it's called
3511.44s: It's a 16-minute video about this exact thing
3516.32s: so
3517.68s: that video
3519.52s: Goes into structuring trades at least what I would consider to be smarter
3524.64s: So that it's not necessarily just lighting money on fire continually. But anyways back to this
3531.44s: So we're gonna get rid of the bids. We're gonna look at the 125s specifically so we can kill the puts
3539.12s: And then we need to look specifically for people that are gaining exposure in 18
3547.12s: Sure, I'm sorry
3548.72s: 16
3550.00s: Oh and then let's do strike price minimum 125 which is also the maximum so we don't have to put into
3558.16s: So let's see
3560.16s: So for the past week
3562.48s: There's and again this is limiting by size right? This is not tracking all of the transactions
3567.44s: This is looking at the larger transactions. That's what these platforms do
3572.00s: I have another platform
3573.76s: Well, really it's a data source opera that I can pull all of the data for if we wanted
3579.60s: But really I just want to highlight the fact that a lot of these positions in general
3584.72s: Are being entered in much smaller size right? So like the total premium for this trade is a thousand bucks
3590.56s: This one right here. So it's just there's just not much size going on here
3597.28s: So more often than not there's
3599.76s: Again, like this isn't probably an institution building some sort of position
3603.92s: They would have to do a lot of this and you can look the way it's deconflected by time
3608.48s: That's probably not the case
3610.24s: Like these look like smaller traders or it could be you know smaller institutions. It's not all institutions are huge
3616.16s: But still um the the idea there that I'm just trying to highlight for you guys
3620.64s: Is that it absolutely looks like there's a mix of activity going on there
3624.24s: I think that's kind of the general synopsis on that
3629.52s: Um
3632.00s: Let me see I'd rather be seeing saying I'd rather be skiing is saying yep
3636.40s: I'm trying to learn proper options so I can stop doing straight equity all the time. Yeah the way that I think about
3642.64s: Trading is options are a tool and
3647.12s: they
3648.72s: They have their place
3650.56s: They're not inherently better than a bunch of other tools
3654.72s: But they do afford a lot of opportunities that are not afforded by things like
3665.20s: equity
3666.80s: So that that is a reality behind these products and I absolutely think that that's something to be aware of for people
3674.96s: Because it's there's they offer a lot of opportunity is what it boils down to
3679.20s: I
3683.44s: Adam says don't understand why there's zero interest in two stocks that have almost perfect correlation
3688.64s: Uh, I didn't see your talk. I'm I'm happy to take a look at whatever you want to take a look at
3693.28s: If there's another stock that you want to look at um, I'm totally down
3699.60s: The I just wanted to be correlated in some degree to to GME because
3705.04s: That mean that's the whole point of this stream specifically
3709.44s: In the meantime, let's take a look
3713.52s: Costs and GME
3715.84s: Yeah, I
3718.08s: So what what like what is the link you guys see maybe we can start there
3724.48s: So Adam could you outline for me the way that you see like the the correlation because here's one of the things to be aware of if you're looking at just the way that price performs
3737.44s: But yeah, I mean let's just take a look. Let's just take a look together really quick because my guess is there will be a few things
3745.44s: Uh, let's go to a parish trade
3749.04s: And then let's take a look at costs and then let's take a look at GME and then let's take a look at costs and then let's take a look at GME
3759.92s: So
3763.28s: They're not that correlated
3767.76s: Adam says their charts are the same. They're the charts are not the same
3771.60s: Again, this is one of the problems that I think people have in the community is they really seek super hard to overfit stuff
3779.92s: That is just not it's just not the same
3784.64s: So for example GME on the 13th it had this move on the 13th cost had this move
3794.00s: Like it's just it's not the same did cost move absolutely but is it the same absolutely not the other data point
3803.20s: I would show to you that shows that it's not the same is if I look at three June I see this move and then if I look at three June I see this move
3813.36s: So
3814.88s: Yeah, I just I don't actually agree that they're the same because they're they're really really not
3822.64s: If I look at something like three July
3826.56s: I see this move and then if I look at three July I see this move
3832.32s: The other thing is looking at just the actual again like an objective analysis of the price behavior
3838.16s: Take a look at the correlations and
3841.20s: How
3842.24s: sporadic they are
3844.00s: 3-day correlation 60% 5-day correlation negative 5% 10-day correlation 53%
3851.12s: 30-day correlation
3852.64s: 3% like this is not a product that's correlated at least in terms of price behavior like again
3858.88s: This is one of the problems is like when you want to see something so bad you can make yourself see it
3865.12s: but like as I look at this
3868.96s: And try to identify that that pattern you're seeing it's just not here
3874.56s: Now I want to be again also very clear
3877.52s: That doesn't mean that there's no
3879.76s: No overlap of course. There's overlap they operate in similar communities to one another
3886.80s: But beyond that I just don't I just don't see
3892.48s: The broader correlation that you're seeing here
3896.00s: Yeah
3897.12s: Even down from like a volume perspective. I don't see it
3900.88s: There's some overlap zero doubt 100% agree with that point
3905.20s: But they do not like going back to the original point. I think that this person made
3910.64s: Is that the their charts are the same and like they they are not the same that is an objective
3917.28s: fallacy
3918.56s: They are correlated in different instances in different degrees, but not the same
3924.24s: Rudevega says why would two completely different stocks correlate
3928.64s: Uh, well a bunch of different reasons like they're they can be part of some of the same ETFs
3934.00s: They can be part of
3936.16s: similar industries
3937.92s: so
3939.20s: I don't know much about costs
3940.80s: So I mean, let's take a quick look and
3943.68s: Specifically just take a look at what industry and like what they do
3950.72s: Consumer discretionary for costs
3954.08s: So there's your first overlap just from a very high perspective. They're both in consumer discretionary straight straight from the jump
3961.20s: So one of the questions uh, Rudevega asks is why would they be why would they correlate a bunch of different reasons
3967.76s: Stocks can correlate if they're in similar industries
3971.12s: Even if they're not having similar experiences
3974.16s: So you'll see this in the financial sectors all the time
3977.92s: And you'll see this across the airlines all the time you'll find things that operate in similar industries like this
3986.00s: that move
3987.60s: Generally similarly to other things
3991.36s: so
3993.36s: Max says cost makes headphones and audio gear they are not the same, but there's several instances where costs had jumps right before gm
3999.20s: moved
4000.40s: Yeah, yeah, I could see why people will say that and I'm not saying it didn't happen
4005.12s: The reason why I have that exasperated response is because
4009.68s: I think in issue like again like let's let's let's look at it
4014.96s: I
4015.60s: We're in this chart over the last six months did cost move before gm
4021.36s: I see some of the similar price movements on the same days
4025.68s: But I don't actually see where costs moved before gm
4031.84s: cake uh k crescia says we're new today today was new and z union break he's off today
4037.76s: But he will be back with us next week and then yeah because we we definitely need the oracle here with all the back
4044.40s: of the scribe I should say
4048.24s: The gm e scribe that's got all this information down pat
4053.04s: But yeah, like I don't even see the the reference there to be completely honest
4058.48s: I see
4060.00s: Like the third cost went up, but so did gm e
4065.44s: I see cost went up ever so slightly here on the 23rd, but so did gm e
4071.36s: So
4073.36s: That that's kind of the that's kind of the problem right is again like I think we attempt to pattern seek to a degree
4081.44s: and over
4083.44s: Over correlate mentally
4085.44s: I'd rather be skiing says I would say they're being manipulated be the same basket of ETF
4089.20s: So they move similarly with big action, but no, uh, I'd rather be skiing
4093.28s: I think that makes a ton of sense that's if I were to
4097.52s: To do what I think is going on in terms of the general correlation
4101.04s: I would see two things. I would see the first thing is they they literally are in the same sector
4106.16s: Right, they're both consumer discretionary that in and of itself will lead them to behave slightly similarly
4113.92s: After that they if depending on how much overlap for those ETFs
4120.24s: I absolutely
4122.32s: Could see the the
4124.32s: Redemption and creation cycle impacting this and the FTD cycle impacting this through the ETFs
4130.32s: So yeah, of course. I I think that there's a lot of credence behind similar similarities here
4137.92s: It's just I don't I wouldn't take the concept of similarities and extrapolate that out into saying they're the same or the charts of the same
4146.48s: again
4147.68s: They are not
4149.12s: And I can see that they are not with my eyeballs
4151.68s: So yeah, it's a and it's a totally fair point like I said
4154.40s: I'm always down to look at whatever you guys want to look at or the ideas
4158.00s: but
4158.96s: I think the the ideas have to be somewhat well-founded
4163.60s: And this again, I see correlation here, but I don't necessarily see the same degree of correlation that it looks like others might see
4174.96s: um
4176.56s: Night harm says can you check blackberry no matter what happens with cyber security or text docs
4182.00s: It doesn't move as all and it's connected to Jimmy basket
4185.92s: I don't know shit about blackberry. So I don't have like a big I forgot how many
4193.76s: Bees it needs
4198.16s: Yeah, I mean, I don't feel much about this
4201.20s: I also have to be honest with you guys like I essentially do not trade stuff that's below five bucks
4206.48s: Like I just don't care
4208.48s: It's from a liquidity perspective stuff that I consider if it's under five bucks, I consider it a penny stock
4214.16s: It's too small and they are very difficult to trade or make money
4219.12s: I know it's alluring to other people
4221.60s: Because they're cheap and if you have a really small account
4224.56s: It might seem attractive, but they're probably not as attractive as people might think they are in my opinion
4229.76s: So I don't have a giant opinion here
4232.64s: You
4235.60s: Ukraine says what about AMC and gme lots of people say they're on the same algo
4240.32s: Uh, that's another tricky one. So first let's dissect this idea of this same algo quote-unquote and I don't think that that's accurate
4248.96s: Because that that's not even how the algorithms for high frequency traders in high frequency trading firms work
4256.64s: Could they be looked at and traded against one another in different baskets and stuff by different algorithms
4262.48s: Of course absolutely and I and I would expect them to be
4266.72s: but
4268.24s: Like again, if I look across this over the last six months and I compare this to the gme chart for the past six months
4275.68s: But they're just they're different. They are different things. That's what I see
4280.88s: Does that mean that they have no overlap or no correlation? Of course not they still seem to too have that
4289.28s: But it's they're different and like I can see that they're different
4294.64s: Running gg.j. running degen says talks about meltup happening in gme next week
4301.28s: I mean, what's the avid again? I think that's one of the problems that blagues the community is that people just say stuff
4307.36s: And maybe that maybe this this person has like great due diligence. I just haven't seen it
4311.92s: So first from your perspective running degen like what what's the theory? What's the thesis behind it?
4318.08s: And why what makes you believe that?
4321.20s: Because I don't necessarily
4324.32s: Like from what you say there it essentially doesn't mean anything to me
4329.36s: If you have a post about anything that they've talked about or like their their ideas
4337.52s: Happy to look at it
4338.72s: But based on that comment alone I can't really do anything with it because it doesn't have any data for me to look up
4345.28s: Speaking of DD though, this one's interesting
4349.28s: So this one got sent over to me
4352.00s: And I think this one is interesting because it apparently looks to speculate on the relationship
4358.24s: between
4360.08s: GME and Chewie which
4362.80s: You can't help but find it interesting right because there is a reality here where
4367.68s: Rory and Kitty who to be very clear is not a cat as indicated by this tick box here very important for everybody to understand not a cat
4379.76s: Has 9 million or access to 9 million 1000 shares. So that's actually one of the first things we need to analyze here is
4388.48s: When filing a 13g do options count
4398.08s: And then as always I prefer to go to the horse's mouth
4406.56s: Should shares that an issue were repurchased to fund a stock option plan the outstanding so that's no
4418.48s: When a 13 d or g sells a security short does the beneficial ownership change
4427.84s: Uh
4429.36s: The same analysis applies to the pledge of a net or the writing of call options
4438.64s: So what I want to what I'm trying to I like discreetly identify because I thought the answer was yes
4444.80s: But I want to actually get to the bottom of it is do options are they part of this
4449.92s: Both
4454.88s: Says check out James Rowan
4457.76s: If
4458.72s: Bo if you have something from James that we should look at put it in here
4463.12s: I don't I don't go chasing like individual ideas
4467.36s: Because there's so many of them
4469.04s: But if you guys have
4470.96s: Accessor if you guys have come across some
4473.52s: That again like look like they have good due diligence. Let's take a look at it like that's the whole point of these sessions
4479.12s: But if the due diligence is you know quote-unquote the melt up with the rocket ship
4482.80s: That's that's not due diligence to me. That's just a hope
4485.92s: Which I do hope that it works out for whoever wants that to happen
4489.76s: But that's personally not what I go off of or anything that I would consider to be like efficacious or like usable information for me
4500.00s: Um
4501.12s: But back to this I really am curious because so let let me take a step back and let me explain to you why I care about this
4508.64s: So
4509.84s: The reason why this matters is because if you can do this with options
4516.00s: You do not need anywhere near the same amount of money that you need if it is not options
4522.88s: So for example, it looks like the purchase happened on June 24
4526.80s: So if we go to Chewy
4529.84s: And we look at 24 June
4533.36s: Which lines up right there's a ton of buy volume
4537.20s: And let's say on 24 June let's give them
4540.00s: Even an advantageous price. Let's say it's like towards the bottom
4543.12s: Let's say he gets in at like 255 his other trades do tend to seem to be like towards the morning
4549.04s: So I imagine it would be close. So let's call it like 2529 or 253 25.3
4555.84s: I literally just typed in 25.6 as I said 25.3 because I'm an idiot
4560.80s: So 9 million
4562.40s: 1000 shares
4564.48s: He needs 227 million 725,300
4569.44s: So what I'm going to do is drop that in the chat here so I keep track of that number. So 227
4576.88s: 725
4578.24s: 300
4580.72s: For shares at
4584.64s: 25.3
4586.72s: So that that's the position
4589.36s: As reported here at least
4592.24s: Now if this was done via options
4596.80s: There's actually a very different position that can be put on
4601.28s: So again, let's go back in time. Let's literally look at this on that day. Let's go to 24 June
4607.84s: In Chewy and we'll go back in time. Welcome to the time machine June 24 Monday
4615.12s: Let's see
4618.64s: So what I can tell you
4622.16s: Is that it didn't happen very first thing on the open at least as of yet
4626.96s: Because I do not see any meaningful volume coming in although it is starting to drift up
4633.04s: indicating to me
4635.76s: some level of
4639.92s: Some level of buying
4642.00s: And then just so you know right now it's pre-buffering. That's why we're just chilling
4648.48s: James says
4650.16s: That's funny James Barrett says James Rowland is saying stuff about weekly and monthly triggers
4654.72s: I don't know what that means, but it would be interested. Yeah
4657.92s: If again if you guys literally just throw in the chat whatever I'm supposed to look at and I'm happy to take a look at it
4664.40s: Uh-oh, so apparently
4669.36s: Apparently the feds the feds is watching we try to go back in time we try to look at this and it disconnected now
4676.96s: It's reconnecting
4679.20s: Max says he he would have have bought on the 13th through the 24th to fill
4684.96s: For options to fill in the 13G
4687.36s: Yeah, exactly I agree with you
4689.36s: Yeah, if it was options until he accumulated whatever total position it would have been
4694.48s: because
4696.24s: The but this lists the date of the event so I know what you're doing there. I think that that makes sense
4704.08s: Yo, what is going on?
4708.96s: This thing is like fully locked up. This is nuts. Let me try change in the time. We'll do like 0732
4721.28s: This is crazy
4728.32s: Masha says I just watched the James video and he just draws random lines on the video and it's from 13 days ago. Yeah
4734.24s: And again, maybe there's more due diligence behind it, but
4742.48s: Yeah, I mean if it amounts to that it doesn't really mean that much to me
4750.56s: Rhino duck
4752.72s: I advise arcade to come back you to weekly or perhaps we're a suit that's funny
4759.20s: Let me see
4762.08s: I'm just curious if I can get this to work like I'm actually kind of fascinated right now
4772.00s: If not we can use current options. It's not a big deal. It just won't be quite as accurate
4778.08s: As I would like it to be
4780.80s: What's happening here? Let me try another ticker. Let's try like apple
4784.24s: Well, let that run for a second. Anyways, back to this in the general hypothesis. So
4795.68s: The reason why I care about this is because if you can use options when filling in a 13G so does a 13G
4804.88s: Apply to options
4807.60s: The reason why this matters because if you can use options you can put this position on much more cheaply
4814.96s: than before
4817.28s: so
4819.52s: This says yes. This is from
4823.28s: This whatever this is
4827.12s: This says 13G of Securities Act 1934 applies to cash settled options
4833.12s: That use okay, so that's actually helpful because this says cash settled options, which is not these
4842.00s: This includes derivatives that are not offered sold originate with the issuer
4848.72s: Uh
4850.32s: Item six to form to include the description. So it would have to be in here. It have to be in item six where's item six
4857.44s: Well, this is seem exactly right
4860.96s: But yeah, anyways this this looks like
4865.92s: This looks like shares to me like based on that based on that quick cursory overview
4871.36s: And the reason why that matters is because in order for that to have happened
4875.12s: Again going back to that comment. I left up and up above for us reference. He needs 227 million 725,300
4882.64s: What we do know
4884.48s: Is that he doesn't have that much money in the account as of 13 June
4889.04s: Meaning to be able to do both positions at once
4895.12s: Now there's some people speculating and Newton and I we went through an exercise
4899.92s: This is just not working up here
4901.92s: We went through an exercise where we
4905.36s: Annelot whoa where we analyzed you know one of his ideas was could he have traded enough options with the residual cash here
4913.36s: The 6.3 million to essentially get another 200 million dollars in the time frame from this update
4919.92s: Which was the 13th of June
4923.60s: Until the trade was reported in July and
4928.40s: Again, I'm very against speaking definitively about things that may or may not be true
4933.76s: But what I can say is the probability that he turned that six million dollars into the requisite
4939.76s: 227 million dollars while completely maintaining this gme position is obscenely low
4945.92s: Just just wildly low
4948.72s: Is it impossible? No not impossible
4951.92s: But is it probable? No not probable at all
4956.16s: So then it leads to the question of does he have other accounts with other money?
4960.32s: Could be again the the only thing I can say about that that I'm unsure of is in his
4967.20s: Live stream that he did which I'll grab real quick. He explicitly said that he doesn't and
4974.08s: I kind of just believe him
4977.92s: Here
4981.76s: Worses
4985.60s: Yeah, no wrong one
4994.32s: Wait
4996.88s: I'm confused
4999.12s: Oh, okay, there it is. I was gonna say is it gone
5003.20s: Here we go
5010.24s: Listen to this real quick because they think he's about to pull his account up. Yeah
5014.96s: It hurts doing my best here. I'm trying to learn them. Oh, but it like it's like a check
5021.44s: Oh, all right, it's not haunted. All right. Don't I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it
5026.80s: Don't try to don't try to do it. All right, let me bring it over here. I think it's I think it's fine if I bring this over
5031.04s: Let me check let me refresh oh
5033.60s: We got it all right. I'm gonna bring it over don't hold it don't hold it. There you go. All right. There you go. Is it on the chat there?
5041.44s: There you go
5043.84s: Cheers
5047.36s: So those yeah those are my only positions, you know as you know about me. I'll take
5053.36s: I
5055.36s: So I true yolo again. I suppose
5057.84s: I know there's some cash that's what I made it depends on your positions, but
5062.88s: So that's it right so he says those are my only positions
5066.40s: He said I know there's some cash there it depends on your position right because
5070.40s: He makes the comment of is cash a position which makes total sense because some people
5075.04s: Genuinely that and that's why he makes that reference is because some people
5079.36s: They legitimately do consider cash a position
5082.64s: So that's why he's making that comment
5085.20s: Uh, it's another yellow again. You know what I'm saying? It's how I roll so that's that's out there, but I see those headlines
5092.72s: e-trade
5094.24s: e-trade I see those headlines
5097.12s: I gotta check I'm checking in every day a long and I'm like my position still actually
5101.20s: I wasn't even like paying attention to the details. They're still there
5104.88s: But I'm each morning. I'm like I don't know what's happening. So I go all right. Well, don't make this
5109.84s: Arm to think oh
5112.40s: He's waking up
5114.40s: They're going down. Oh is it halted again because if um if if it's halted it doesn't show yeah there you go
5120.80s: There you go
5122.96s: It's going down in general educational advice here in general not not specific to
5127.76s: So yeah anyways that I think that's informative right? So then it goes back to the idea of
5135.04s: Begging the question of word is that $227 million come from
5139.28s: So
5141.92s: I don't know. I really don't know the simplest answer in my opinion aligns actually with what this
5149.44s: I think this person is talking about we have to go through this really quick because somebody was talking about this
5154.24s: This post they send it to me and I wanted to look through so this is from
5158.80s: green
5164.72s: You gonna see this person's name
5168.64s: This is crazy
5170.64s: This is crazy
5173.68s: The person's name is green Carly Gatling gun
5177.76s: Oh, it's so awesome
5179.76s: Masha says he has a fidelity tab. It's possible that he has a lot of cash sitting in that account
5184.64s: But it's just pure speculation
5186.56s: Yeah, and I think it's it's okay to guess right
5190.16s: but
5191.44s: the way I look at it at least is
5194.32s: I just go off of what he's saying
5197.36s: and
5199.60s: Could there be something else sure actually let's see
5204.40s: Yes, so I see because here's my guess with fidelity
5209.20s: My guess is that his prior employment is through there
5213.52s: And my guess is that's like a retirement account
5216.08s: Because he used to work at a financial institution and I'm sure that he probably got a 401k through them
5221.84s: So my guess is that's probably a retirement account if if I had to guess
5226.56s: That's a pretty standard
5229.76s: That's a pretty standard provider for those especially for financial companies and stuff
5235.68s: so
5237.12s: Yeah, anyways again
5239.60s: Masha to your point you could be completely cracked there could be another account and he goes in there and checks it out or it could be a bunch of cash could be absolutely could be
5247.60s: It also again in my opinion could be just a retirement account
5251.04s: That's my guess
5252.16s: But we have no idea could be either or
5259.92s: Banana says retirement account lol, but yeah could be yeah like my my guess is probably a
5268.16s: Like if you work at an employer that offers a 401k they have like specific people they offer them through you don't get to pick like I have
5275.84s: Um, I don't know if it's on it's not on here. I because I use their fidelity but like my I have a 401k through there
5281.12s: When I worked at Deloitte so yeah
5285.84s: It's really really common for those kinds of things at least in my opinion
5292.88s: To be provided by
5294.88s: Somebody like fidelity so yeah, it's it's completely possible
5300.32s: Anyways now that I got over this really really fun this really fun thing let's take a look
5307.92s: so
5310.08s: They're trying to solve the puzzle
5312.88s: Um, I'm just trying to get to the part where they start talking about stuff
5318.16s: Jacob Walter says how would you play an event like six three if you had calls going into it
5323.20s: I assume you're talking about in game stop
5330.16s: Like this event
5332.80s: And
5334.80s: And
5335.76s: Jacob give me more context are you talking about like on the day of the event into the event? Do we know about the event or not
5343.76s: You have to give me way more information
5346.00s: So following that it's this following that word we have calls of some sort
5352.40s: Going into it and we didn't know it was going to happen
5354.56s: But
5359.28s: But then that leads to a couple follow on questions of like what what's the what's the position?
5365.68s: What's the point of the original position?
5367.92s: What's the objective for it that kind of stuff because I mean for me
5372.16s: If you had calls leading into this you made money right like it started up
5376.48s: So for me, I'll tell you guys right now like I played this move
5380.96s: I played not this move but this end into this and then I played from this down to this
5387.92s: I played from this down
5392.32s: I played this up
5395.52s: I played this down
5397.52s: I actually got stopped out on this one
5399.92s: And then this is for like options plays. I've had long shares in game stop for a while now
5407.20s: um, I just kind of hold them
5409.20s: But the options plays are completely different like the options plays are really designed to take advantage of momentum and movement
5416.00s: So every time that I see these larger moves, I'm playing them
5419.92s: now for something like this if I had long calls I like just figure out where the profit point is and take the damn profit
5426.88s: But that kind of stuff has to be decided before you enter and then what I like to use are
5433.04s: A series of different stop orders
5436.08s: To phase me out of a position to give it time in case there's some sort of intraday reversal
5441.36s: because those happen
5443.04s: so
5444.08s: I think
5445.44s: Yeah, I mean that's the general idea is I'm trying to capture the the most
5450.40s: movement that I can and
5453.44s: Specifically with options the movement that's one of the cool parts about options is I get to trade movement to
5458.96s: To different directions up and down and sideways
5462.24s: So like right now the positions I'm using are I have long shares
5466.80s: I don't have any long options anymore. I'm completely out of them
5469.68s: But I have short options against some of my shares
5473.52s: Meaning sold calls against some of the shares
5476.88s: And it's literally to just make it easier to hold those shares as the underlying is trending sideways
5483.76s: But I already started phasing out of my long share position as well. I paired it down quite a lot
5488.96s: Because of these two moves
5491.76s: And then this is also where I exited essentially all of the remaining long options that I had
5496.80s: And it's just because options are decaying asset
5500.00s: And the I know that a lot of folks in the ape community they you know want to hold and just kind of diamond hand it
5508.32s: But if you do that
5510.72s: With something like options you will be holding dust
5514.96s: Because they go away you can't just hold them otherwise you will be holding nothing
5521.76s: Black swan says what made you exit the set call position
5525.52s: The stock wasn't accommodating. Yeah, I mean that's really what it boils down to the that position was put on
5532.48s: To attempt to capitalize on an upward price movement
5535.84s: There was not a corresponding upward price movement. So again for me the calculus literally is quite that simple right like
5543.68s: If I'm trading long calls. I want something to go up if it's not going up. I don't have the right position on
5549.20s: That's essentially the basis
5554.64s: Uh, Jacob says if you know it's going to dump at market open would you risk selling at open when it's volatile sure
5562.00s: Because if you have long calls selling when it's volatile is good anyways that expansion and volatility helps your helps the long calls
5569.68s: If you have long calls and volatility starts to decay out your long calls will decline in premium as well
5578.24s: All other options as volatility starts to bleed out
5582.40s: So the problem you'll have in that instance is depending on the expiration of the long calls is how illiquid they are
5588.16s: That's one of the reasons why I took my options positions that I'm buying to the upside my long calls further out in time
5594.88s: Because one of the problems you're going to have and we went through an example of this before and if on demand works
5599.60s: I'd love to show you again because it's a it's a good message to share with you guys
5603.92s: because
5605.76s: One of the the issues that you'll have is if there is a big accommodating move even if it's in your favor
5611.76s: liquidity is going to widen out and something like game stop massively
5615.36s: So then it's really difficult to get out of your options at a fair price. It's a actually kind of a giant problem
5623.52s: so that's also why I use a mix of
5627.28s: options and shares
5629.28s: Because I don't want to get stuck if liquidity dries up too much and I can't get a decent fill
5635.76s: That would be really annoying if you get a good price move in your favor
5639.68s: But then the the markets don't accommodate moving through it
5643.04s: This doesn't look like it's going to work for us. Sorry gang
5648.80s: Hey, hey, hey, there we go
5651.76s: It worked
5653.12s: Beautiful so yeah, let's take a look at an example. Oh, this makes me super excited
5657.76s: The chart doesn't work. Well, who cares? We don't really need the chart. I do need to go back and pick a day though
5663.84s: So let's pick
5667.52s: one may
5670.40s: And then let's pick
5673.44s: I guess we could do the 14th. It doesn't even have to be the 14th, but we could we could use the 14th 14th may
5679.04s: Now let's take a look at a quick example together
5682.08s: So if I go to one may
5686.08s: One may
5688.16s: Let me go to the options
5693.20s: If this works that would be absolutely fantastic. That would be a giant fan
5707.04s: And there we go cool. This is great. So now let's pick something like let's take a look at this 17 May
5716.40s: And let's pretend that we want to buy this at the money
5720.48s: So let's analyze this trade
5723.68s: And then let's take a look at the risk profile here
5726.56s: So this will take a look at all the different positions that we want to compare
5730.96s: So that's that now let's take a look at and I'm building just different kinds of positions
5737.68s: So in the 17 May expiration
5741.68s: I'm using a mix of
5744.72s: At the money in the money out of the money that kind of stuff
5749.28s: and then
5751.36s: Let's take a look at something closer to what I would put on
5757.84s: Which would be something like this
5765.84s: Yeah, something like that. All right now let's fast forward to 14 May
5770.96s: What I want to do is show you what the liquidity looks like on these different contracts
5777.84s: Right now you can see that there you know, maybe 30 cents wide, 32 cents wide something like that for these tens
5784.80s: Right, so just remember the let me get out of your way the bid asks spread there
5796.48s: I think my I got an alert from oh perfect
5801.84s: My door dashes on the way
5805.28s: So now take a look at the width here. Let me get out of the way
5809.36s: On those further out of the monies
5811.76s: We would have got them at a pretty good price
5816.00s: But still if you take a look at the width of these they were like 32 cents wide
5821.36s: Now
5822.72s: They're like a dollar 45
5826.00s: Massive massive massive expansion in the bid asks spread these have become
5834.48s: Way less liquid
5835.92s: So even though the position would make a lot of money because of the overall appreciation which is fantastic
5841.20s: It still has that problem in front of it where when you're getting out you're still going to essentially give a pound of flesh
5848.72s: In order to get out
5850.48s: Which is annoying
5852.00s: So yeah, anyways, that's the the overall background behind that I want to make sure if that point makes sense to you guys
5857.84s: the idea that as things become more volatile
5861.52s: The premium of options will increase but the liquidity of options will also widen out to a degree it leads to a bit of a problem
5871.52s: Because if you're trading options and stuff like this you have to be aware of that
5875.04s: Otherwise, you're going to find yourself in a really terrible scenario even if something starts working out
5880.72s: in your favor
5884.48s: All right, so now back to this so this person says they're good at logical gluages, which is great
5891.76s: And
5893.12s: This okay, so it talks about the 13G
5897.12s: in Chewie and
5902.16s: He's guessing that by doing by taking 6.6 percent
5906.96s: That
5910.80s: Interesting
5915.28s: Oh, yeah, sorry, I missed a question in here
5918.24s: Nathan says what are your thoughts on our case final beer emoji given the fact that international beer days
5926.32s: I have no idea how to interpret those emojis. I have to be honest with you
5929.68s: I'm not weighing them very heavily myself
5932.24s: And it's just because they're they're so obscure
5936.32s: and
5939.04s: Yeah, I think
5944.00s: I don't think that much of them in terms of direct connections
5947.52s: I just think it's too obscure and the other thing is remember
5952.32s: Well, first you guys tell me I don't remember when did he put that that those stream of emojis out when did when did that happen
5961.44s: Do you guys know you guys probably know better than me
5967.92s: Afonso says I checked there's no fidelity tab on his live stream. It's a bookmark
5972.32s: You would seem fidelity on his regular source of yeah exactly when yeah, oh, I see you're correct
5977.28s: And somebody else calling it a tab. Yeah, I just inferred bookmark when I saw it, but I see what you mean
5983.92s: Um
5986.88s: But yeah, like when did when did he make that thing with all the emojis do you guys know
5996.40s: Damn it you guys are making me look it up our uh roaring kitty
6001.60s: emoji
6003.76s: Timeline
6005.20s: Video was it a video that he made
6007.60s: You
6013.60s: There we go at the end on May 15th
6019.36s: Yeah, so it was May 15th is when this came out
6025.84s: Here
6030.32s: So
6032.32s: 15 may he made this
6036.08s: The problem in my opinion is well a few things
6042.16s: Like the dog here
6045.60s: Would I have guessed that he was
6049.76s: projecting out in time from the 15th of May
6054.88s: That on the 20 what the was it the 24th?
6059.92s: Is that right? Let me see the
6062.88s: Uh, we don't need this anymore this
6067.28s: June 24
6069.52s: So do I think that this here is him flagging
6074.16s: On the 15th of May that on the 24th of June that he's gonna buy Chewie I personally don't see that
6082.56s: personally and the reason being is because
6087.76s: I
6088.96s: And he he could have
6091.92s: Done that I want to be very clear like this just my guess
6095.76s: He could have done that but my guess is against that specifically because
6101.52s: he's
6103.52s: He can't know what Chewie's gonna look like
6106.80s: On that day at that point
6108.88s: and there's a really really good chance
6112.40s: That if things didn't look right for some reason or if new information was injected into this scene
6118.96s: Gearies before it happened
6121.28s: That that probably wouldn't have happened
6123.68s: right
6124.64s: so
6126.24s: I think
6127.44s: Yeah to me I just think that he might be trolling a little bit grabbing this from a missie Elliott song which is hilarious
6136.72s: And I think he also knows that people really really look into things
6141.68s: And my guess is he probably has some fun with that
6144.72s: So if we take a look I want to show you guys this interview really quick with uh
6149.12s: Ryan Cohen
6151.68s: And there was a really funny part in this interview that I saw
6160.64s: I think it was maybe a podcast this
6169.04s: This here so I'm gonna you guys should be able to hear the volume and stuff but there's
6174.96s: There's one in particular we need to look at
6177.60s: Yeah
6178.96s: For go for it
6185.44s: All right no
6189.44s: No no no no no no no no no no no no
6196.80s: Good shorts this one
6199.60s: And while this is playing I'm actually gonna grab my dog real quick
6203.20s: So you guys should be able to hear this and I'll be back in two seconds
6207.36s: Okay, you can't hear that because I can't hear it. Why can't I hear that
6213.12s: And it's okay here you go
6215.84s: All right, then Virginia it's a photo of you in a game stop store
6220.48s: May 12th 2021. I think that's pretty self-explanatory
6224.64s: I think there was an article that came out that claimed you were ghost shopping is that what you do?
6229.68s: I mean, I'm always kind of you know when I go into the stores ghost shopping
6234.08s: checking out the place
6236.48s: Seeing what the inventory and you don't get recognized yeah
6239.60s: Yeah, more more recently. I have a harder to do okay, okay now when I wrote about this on our website
6246.08s: I noted what was in your hand and we spent a lot of time trying to figure out we thought it was a scooter electric scooter
6253.20s: Yes, it was not an electric scooter though, but it was a scooter
6257.12s: Just a non-electric scooter. Do you do that a lot? Do you ride a normal scooter around?
6262.56s: No, it was in mine actually it was my son. All right. All right
6265.52s: That's fair. So we got that one right
6268.16s: These kind of things we look at every every detail matters
6271.92s: Yeah, of course people were looking at the way the games were set up on this part right here thought maybe there's a message there
6277.68s: So you hear that and then listen literally perfect timing listen to his response
6282.88s: Yeah, there wasn't one right no message in the games. I mean
6289.04s: No, there wasn't no
6291.36s: So that right there and also so that you guys have a chance to see the
6294.72s: This is the gmme master. Wow. I need to get a haircut my hair is way too long don't like that
6300.64s: So anyways, this is Thor he wanted to come by say hello show some love for GameStop
6306.08s: He is right now is this like little feed up
6309.68s: Little tiny kind of little baby feed
6312.56s: He's a little baby
6314.08s: But anyways, what I want to highlight from this video in particular
6319.60s: Is the fact that
6321.60s: You know the the interviewer when so far as to say like oh
6326.08s: you know people are
6328.64s: um
6329.44s: Like people are guessing that there is some hitting meaning behind the arrangement of the games
6336.48s: and
6338.32s: He obviously jokes. He's like no, there's no meaning right so I the reason why I think that's a really important part for people to see
6346.80s: Is that it just shows this idea of like pattern seeking and we want to look for all this meaning in all these different things
6355.20s: and sometimes when you have like a collective intellect looking for those things all at the same time with all of their combined resources
6363.36s: They can find a lot of shit. I had somebody sending me literally like binary code about the color scheme
6370.72s: That roaring kitty used in the chewy post that he put up
6375.52s: and then he turned that
6378.32s: He had turned the binary code. I it was into another language
6383.04s: And the like I don't it was an old language. I don't want to say it was like sans sprint
6387.92s: But it was something like that and there was a semi-intelligible message in there and this person had thought
6395.84s: That roaring kitty changed the color of chewy
6399.28s: think using a specific color coding scheme that then translated into a binary code that one translated into sans sprint
6408.96s: Had a message
6411.52s: Right
6413.04s: probability of that is is pretty low
6418.88s: As I continue to always say it's not zero and there are hidden meanings in things that he does because also
6426.80s: To the other side of
6429.36s: this equation
6431.36s: Is there is a reality behind how roaring kitty communicates and he does use memes right
6440.80s: He makes subtle changes
6443.60s: to these different memes
6446.24s: And this is exactly how he does right so like I can see why people do that
6452.32s: Because he makes these memes with game stop there the little kitty in the pocket that right like
6457.52s: So I totally get it. I totally get why people
6460.80s: Read into this stuff because it's meant to be read into to a degree
6464.48s: But the problem again is that when your brain is primed to do that
6469.36s: Then it can go overboard
6471.68s: Especially when there are a lot of people
6474.72s: Again like the combined intellect is so so much
6481.36s: smarter
6482.56s: Than any individual
6484.56s: Joe Fonacelo who did that interview is now game stop social media head. That's awesome. That's I love that
6491.12s: Big big fan
6492.64s: So yeah anyways, that's part of what I see there
6496.56s: And I think this is a good reminder of
6499.92s: sometimes
6501.60s: That there it's just it's just not meant to be you know necessarily something that in depth
6507.04s: In that the games weren't associated in a specific manner
6511.20s: You know nothing like that
6514.40s: So yeah back to the emojis thing I just I have a hard time seeing it personally
6519.36s: That's not like of course a bunch of this stuff could line up with different things that that's the nature of something like emojis is that
6526.16s: There's so simple and open ended that you can look at these things in a million different ways
6533.28s: So it makes them highly applicable
6536.40s: It's like the same thing that you'll find with a lot of bullshit internet stock gurus
6541.36s: Who they'll say shit like
6543.44s: blah blah blah blah
6544.88s: Could be support or could be resistance
6548.40s: Well, so there was no shit Sherlock like price can move. Thank you for that revelation
6554.24s: But the point being is it's just it's just a broad statement
6558.88s: So that if something happens even closely aligned to what that person said then they get to say like oh well
6564.72s: It means this which that's probably not what they meant at the point of saying it
6572.96s: Um
6574.00s: De Swag says but the Larry Chang aspect is a direct vision for the future of the company. That's all I need
6578.96s: Yeah, I agree
6579.76s: I think Larry Chang from what I've read is he seems like a really cool dude
6583.68s: I'd love to talk to him and just learn a little bit more about how he views all this stuff
6588.00s: Because it's very interesting to me
6590.88s: Now let's keep going with this
6593.28s: so
6595.04s: The idea here is that he's trying to reenact 2021 and why would he use
6601.20s: Chewy over game stop
6604.00s: Um, it talks about it being heavily shorted
6608.24s: That the buyback pulled away liquidity
6611.68s: An enormous buy and triggered a VWOP order to settle the trade
6618.88s: This I need to learn more about the way that you guys think about VWOP orders
6624.32s: Because it's it looks like the way you guys might think about them
6630.88s: Might differ a bit from the way I would think about it
6636.00s: But anyways, uh the biggest holding of XRT shorted 300 percent. Yep, that makes sense Sanworm is approaching
6644.24s: There's no way this trade settled. Okay, okay
6647.92s: So far this looks reasonable to me
6652.64s: DFE sold 225 million worth of game stop
6657.92s: To buy Chewy
6661.44s: Yeah, I think I mean I think that that makes sense
6668.32s: I probably would assume the same thing there. I think that's okay
6671.60s: Oh
6675.52s: I get why that's such a big deal this makes sense
6680.24s: Uh stories of opacity says Richard said his favorite thing is a VWOP order
6686.32s: Um, yeah, no, so to be clear like I know what they are
6689.84s: I'm just trying to understand the way that you guys think about it in terms of like why that would be so impactful here
6696.32s: A VWOP order why not a different kind of order why not any other order
6701.28s: type why specifically a VWOP order what the reason why I asked that question is I'm gaining context about how the community in this
6709.60s: In this context
6712.32s: The the tool itself
6714.80s: because
6716.32s: Again, like there's a million other order types that could occur here
6720.00s: So I'm trying to understand that emphasis specifically on a VWOP order from like a standard practitioner standpoint
6726.00s: I totally understand why like for somebody like Newton
6729.52s: I could see why he would like a VWOP order because it's essentially putting you in where a lot of other people like something
6735.68s: so yeah, I
6737.68s: From a from Newton standpoint, I get it, but from something like this I don't fully get it and that's what I'm trying to understand
6748.40s: Because in this
6750.88s: Yeah, because in this case it literally could be a million of different kinds of things
6756.72s: VWOP is described as a price insensitive buy order to satisfy an order left to the last data settle
6769.92s: Wait, that confuses me now
6773.20s: Now I'm now I'm not following
6775.52s: You
6785.76s: I'm trying to see if I can find any articles on it if you guys know any let me know
6799.52s: Mm-mm-mm
6802.32s: Because I know
6805.36s: Well, I know a few things that might be useful
6813.60s: But I'm guessing it might be an HFT
6820.00s: Let me see
6822.24s: Yeah, so all right, let me
6825.60s: I think he means VWOP is a buying order no matter what the price is because they need to settle
6829.60s: Yeah, see that's the thing that was that's not what a VWOP order is
6835.20s: Stories of opacity says I think Richard believes when a VWOP order hits it can be used to help figure out a timeline. I'm also
6843.76s: Let me see I am going to
6847.36s: Add this to our to-do list for next week so that I can learn more about it
6854.48s: Because here's here's what I would think
6857.84s: My guess is that
6860.72s: There this is more so like a dark pool
6866.16s: A dark pool slash HFT triggered
6871.60s: Movement that's my guess
6875.12s: So from like my interpolation of this is that it's expected that there's some some sort of
6884.00s: um
6885.84s: There's an expectation that funds use VWOPs specifically and
6891.52s: And because
6892.96s: funds and other entities use VWOPs as conditional buying circumstances that it would lend efficacy behind
6901.28s: If he buys moving into other VWOP resting VWOP or penning resting VWOP order types that it would cause a big move
6909.76s: Like that's my guess, but I don't know and that's exactly why I'm asking the question to see if you guys are looking at this in the context of some sort of value
6918.80s: Idea if it's some sort of technical component like I'm talking about in terms of um
6925.52s: HFT inclusion or fund inclusion stuff like that
6935.84s: Jotato says perplexity a waps says VWOP order can decrease volatility on large orders. Yeah, definitely
6941.76s: so
6943.28s: Yeah, I totally get that
6946.00s: Nightham says what the fuck did you say can you explain it to me? Can you explain it as if we eat crayons?
6957.20s: Oh, that's so funny
6962.80s: Um
6966.32s: How do I think that's so funny. I love that response so much
6974.00s: Um
6975.92s: Yeah, let me think about it. So there's a there are different order types that mean things to different entities
6986.16s: There's things like T-wops and VWOPs
6989.92s: T-wops are time weighted average price VWOP is volume weighted average price
6997.28s: So they mean slightly different things
7000.72s: But when you look at
7003.36s: big institutions they're incentivized to try and manage entry price
7008.64s: That's essentially why we have things like dark pools is it is the effort of those entities to manage
7016.96s: their entry prices to avoid being pushed around or people front running the orders and moving things
7022.56s: so
7024.00s: Like a great example of this is the flash crash in 2010 that was essentially a
7031.04s: A messed up
7033.04s: Order entry where they used VWOP instead of T-wop which would have helped their exposure and it would have moved completely different
7042.08s: So they'll use those kinds of order types to fill positions while trying to be more sensitive to entry price and
7049.12s: To not be front ran. This is again like institutional side of things
7055.20s: so
7056.48s: When I think about this theory in general
7061.52s: That's what I would personally take away that it's predicated on that behavior
7067.68s: But I didn't know from your guys's perspective like what this looks like or why this would be a thing
7073.12s: So let me know if that makes sense
7076.64s: um
7078.72s: As if you e crayons
7081.68s: the
7082.88s: summary of that is
7086.16s: institutions
7087.76s: might want to use these
7091.28s: and
7092.96s: It's to try and be more price sensitive. I think that's the best guess
7099.60s: So anyways back to this
7102.24s: This makes sense to me
7105.68s: and then
7108.64s: This also makes sense
7110.64s: Right like because I know and this is something that Newton is brought up and we've had good conversations about it
7115.52s: I'm still unsure because from Newton sheet
7119.04s: It shows that essentially rk is never
7123.04s: Decreased his position size
7126.32s: One of the problems with Newton sheets is that he has so much stuff in here that's difficult to find
7132.72s: And
7136.64s: Uh, did I pass it already
7140.32s: So over here there it is
7142.48s: Over to the right. It was a cheeky over to the right
7145.84s: So what Newton showed me is that he's never decreased his shares
7150.64s: Now again, I see Newton's point
7154.48s: But the way I look at it is
7158.00s: I am not convinced
7161.04s: That rk is maintained static positions essentially from the time that he's added each of these we know this
7168.48s: Probably not to be true with the most recent trade in
7174.00s: chewy like
7175.60s: it probably is not the case like I just
7180.72s: I'm not sure that he has
7183.20s: 400 million dollars now after the recent pullback and gamestopp unless because I don't think he pulled anything out
7190.16s: At least based on the subsequent account updates
7193.12s: could of
7194.32s: But I don't think he did
7196.64s: so
7198.80s: This to me I'm unsure
7202.24s: Kev says what if he used capital for selling calls
7206.08s: I think the problem is with the the call theory one I would see more of that volume especially against nine million shares
7215.36s: and
7216.40s: It but he could and he could be generating
7219.84s: premium by selling calls
7221.92s: the problem he would have if he does that
7225.44s: Is that he would be capping some of the upside on his position and I'm just not sure that he would do that
7233.28s: So I don't know maybe you guys have seen him sell calls before like in some of his other updates
7238.08s: I just haven't seen that yet
7239.84s: and it doesn't necessarily fully seem to align with the positions that I've seen him share with us
7245.84s: Because he could have sold calls at a bunch of different points here
7251.60s: so
7254.48s: Yeah
7255.28s: Kev said bought to me call calls and sold Jamie or even Chewy yeah maybe
7260.96s: Banana says his last
7262.96s: Yolo update fell ages ago. It was the 13th of June so a month ago
7267.92s: and in this he had nine million
7270.40s: Game stop at
7272.40s: 23 4135 for 262 mil 6 mil cash total account value 268 mil
7280.00s: So yeah, it's definitely been a minute
7284.56s: Yeah, interesting
7287.76s: Um, let's
7289.28s: Finish going through this before a hop off and if there's anything else that you guys want to hit quick before I balance feel free to start throwing those in now so that I don't leave you hanging
7300.32s: This makes sense
7302.08s: Essentially saying that he probably
7304.88s: Exited and he's just providing you know basis for it
7311.04s: Uh, this is looking at potentially when he sold it looks like
7315.68s: Which I could see right that's a lot of volume down volume
7322.72s: Purchased nine million 25 to 25 you up that lines up
7327.36s: selling price 27 and a half a point two
7331.68s: Yep, I could see this
7336.56s: All right, so what's the plan
7339.92s: So he thinks the move is going to be in Chewy
7344.64s: And essentially that the buy-in is going to create
7348.88s: A bit of a movement which I could see
7353.84s: So that happened on
7356.96s: 24 June is when the entry
7361.28s: looked like it occurred
7364.32s: June
7367.28s: 24
7369.92s: So then one
7373.36s: two three four
7376.32s: five
7378.40s: So then this week if this thesis is correct this week we should see
7383.68s: Some pretty significant movement
7388.88s: Now we're doing the emojis thing which I don't know
7392.24s: Like this here, right? Like if he posted that on 15 May
7397.44s: Again, like this being interpreted as spy crashing 2%
7402.72s: I just don't see
7405.52s: Like I don't see how we could logically conclude that on the 15th of May
7411.28s: When he posted that that he knew that on the 22nd of July spy would fall 2%
7418.00s: Like I just just don't see that
7423.20s: Peyton welcome to outliers supporter thanks for supporting the channel really appreciate that. Thank you very much
7428.16s: I
7430.16s: Don't know about cycles, but from buy to squeeze 27 trading days
7437.28s: So this is postulating 20s or I say so he's going back
7450.80s: Um
7451.76s: Nightham said but the famous guy predicted stock market housing crash. Yeah Michael Burry
7457.20s: What about it?
7458.80s: Michael Burry saw something completely different and I think you might be misinterpreting what I'm saying
7463.12s: I'm not saying things can't be predicted of course they can
7465.92s: Right like I can predict where I think the stock market is going to go in two years
7471.28s: And with something like positive drift I know it's pretty fair certainty that it will be higher
7476.64s: Now the other thing to know about Michael Burry in the big short though is he missed time to his entry terribly
7483.04s: And he almost went insolvent he almost had to close the fund he had he had to go to extremes
7489.76s: Essentially disallowing people from pulling their money out because if they did
7495.28s: He wouldn't have been able to hold the position long enough in order for it to potentially pay out
7501.60s: But the other thing is Michael Burry's position was predicated on really hard data
7507.60s: Observable data that can you literally can draw
7511.52s: Very logical conclusions from the idea that
7515.84s: With those kinds of positions and seeing essentially the way that MBS securities were being built
7522.88s: That like his conclusion was very very much
7526.80s: Um
7528.08s: Yeah, very much reasonable
7529.60s: And the other thing I would offer
7531.60s: With just context for Burry is that if you watch the rest of his calls
7535.52s: He's been wrong a ton and that's not to cast rocks. I'm wrong a ton myself. We're all wrong a lot
7541.28s: But that's the nature of predictions right is Michael Burry is really remembered for that one that he got right in a really big way
7550.32s: Because of how harrowing of a story that was
7555.04s: The kind of overshadows all the other times that were completely wrong and that's essentially some of what you see there
7561.84s: So yeah, I think
7565.68s: Yeah, I think it's important because it's completely reasonable to make predictions and it's part of the process of being a traitor
7573.04s: But it's a difficult game I think
7577.92s: Uh, Peyton says the flag emoji mic emoji and then music ls xm plus Siri
7586.00s: Uh, I don't know I again like
7589.44s: I don't really mess with the emoji change too much. I just I just struggle way too much
7595.28s: To believe that he
7597.76s: Again, like even that right there, right if he made that post on 15 May
7604.72s: I just do not see him essentially forecasting the creation of those three emojis to mean
7612.96s: 16 aug calls
7615.68s: Like I just I don't see that
7620.56s: So yeah, I mean to me I don't really I don't see much there
7624.88s: Uh
7629.36s: Peyton says what do you think about
7633.92s: No, he is in the 16 aug calls now that's what I'm saying is like I don't see
7639.76s: I don't see the connection there Peyton you're saying that
7642.88s: He knew that uh, yeah, so
7645.52s: Here's the deal that merger has been on the table for a long time. I think people are really really mistaken
7651.84s: About this the Siri merger. This has been announced for literally since December of 2023
7659.60s: So what he did not know is when this merger would gain any semblance of traction because it's been underway for so long
7668.88s: Mergers take a long time
7672.16s: So what I'm saying is of course you knew about the merger we all knew about the merger literally from last year
7679.52s: We knew about the we knew about the merger
7682.72s: so
7684.80s: What I'm uh
7686.80s: Fonzos says first emoji was not on the 15th but the 12th if it matters. Thanks for thanks for the the
7692.80s: Correction it at least it doesn't matter in the context that I'm talking about it
7696.96s: But it's useful and I'd rather have the correct date anyways, so I appreciate it
7701.36s: um
7702.40s: But what I'm highlighting here is like this merger is not new
7706.00s: And when he made that post specifically on the 12th then
7711.04s: I don't think that there was any reality where he was like combining those three emojis to forecast the 16 uh calls
7720.08s: You know as part of a position for him based on some expected new emergence of information regarding this merger
7726.88s: That has been underway for half a year
7729.60s: So again
7731.36s: I want to go all the way back could that have been the case? It could
7734.96s: It could
7736.16s: Like technically it could
7738.40s: But I just view that as a highly low probability event personally
7744.64s: So
7747.20s: Paynes is what do you think of the chain?
7750.24s: He could be anybody could be yeah, so the the thing is is like I have no idea what we're in kitty is trading
7756.56s: I have no idea
7758.00s: but
7759.20s: It there's a lot of activity in here
7762.00s: Anything that's going through the process of a merger or
7766.00s: acquisition
7767.44s: It's going to be super active because people are going to speculate on
7772.40s: Whatever they believe the terminal value of the product is going to be that's being bought out
7777.44s: Because there's a potential trade opportunity there now the risk in the trade is if it doesn't happen
7783.68s: And again a great example of this is if we use twitter
7787.20s: Because twitter shows you the exact price performance of something that is going through a series of maybe maybe nots
7795.60s: So let me move this out to like I don't need five years and you look four years
7800.40s: So here's the deal there's the original
7803.92s: Rumor of a buyout right stock shoots up on the buyout news hangs out
7810.48s: Then news of the buyout starts to get digested it looks like it's complicated looks like it might get blocked
7816.48s: And it starts to decline
7818.48s: Then it looks like there's better news about the buyout higher probability price drifts up towards the buyout price
7824.80s: Then it essentially falls through Elon starts seeing all these shit about fake accounts starts trying to back out of the buyout
7832.16s: And then all of a sudden twitter falls back down to pre buyout levels
7837.28s: hangs out hangs out hangs out until it starts looking like buyout probability is going to start going up
7842.64s: And then you can see when the probability of the buyout became near terminal
7846.40s: With this giant skyrocketing price and then post price drift
7850.64s: This is when the market became more certain that the buyout was going to happen
7854.64s: And it eventually happened what on 28 October something like that is that right
7862.00s: Erden uh
7863.84s: Is it I don't remember
7865.84s: No, not October I forgot exactly when the buyout happened
7870.00s: But the cash merger this says 1028
7874.00s: So in this case anyways what I'm highlighting is you're seeing something that from the literally April
7880.56s: Out until November
7883.36s: Was going through this cycle of trying to understand this buyout opportunity
7888.72s: It's the anything that's going through a merger acquisition goes through a similar path because there's a lot of hurdles
7893.92s: They have to get over some of them are still happening that you've heard of before
7898.48s: With really big companies
7900.72s: So yeah all I'm saying is that
7903.28s: This the buyout with Syria is nothing new the information there is nothing new. It's been digested for a long time
7910.24s: And the options chains being active in something like Siri is completely predictable
7917.20s: Because of the merger news people like me will trade that all the time
7921.76s: Now something like this you can come up with a lot of interesting ideas
7926.72s: Based on where you see most of the activity
7929.84s: So yeah, there's a ton of different ideas you can draw from this but yeah
7936.24s: It does not surprise me at all that there's activity in here, but that is not the point of this stream
7943.92s: We look in at some game stop and it is actually time for me to run
7950.40s: It's been absolutely awesome hanging out with you guys. Thank you guys so much
7954.16s: For sharing more of the story with me. I look forward to next weekend getting back in with really our scribe was all the history our boy Newton
7962.48s: But thank you guys for helping me learn more
7965.44s: I'm enjoying the story tremendously
7968.40s: As always if there's anything that you want me to take a look at let me know right like that's I'm happy to look at things
7973.52s: I'm trying I'm happy to try to share what level of information and knowledge and experience I can with you guys
7979.44s: Make good decisions out there
7981.44s: Do not forget to be an outlier and I'll see you guys later
