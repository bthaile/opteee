0.00s:  What's up everybody?
2.40s:  So as you can tell, it is me alone and unafraid today, but I still wanted to make sure that
10.64s:  we're kind of keeping the cadence.
13.24s:  Unfortunately, Newton was busy today, which I mean, the man as a family is stuff to do,
19.08s:  I totally understand.
20.84s:  But he and I were going to connect back up next weekend.
24.00s:  So for this session today, what I wanted to do is use it as a little bit more of a learning
30.36s:  session for me.
31.88s:  And hopefully to understand more of what you guys are looking at, how you're receiving
36.48s:  and thinking about the information.
38.84s:  And then obviously if there's questions that you guys have, one, I would do my best,
43.88s:  especially if it's options related and stuff, yeah, I can handle that, no problem.
47.68s:  But if there's questions that you guys have or ideas that I don't know about, I'm going
51.00s:  to keep it a buck with you and I'll tell you I have no idea.
53.36s:  And then, but what I can do is keep those in my back pocket for when we have this session
57.56s:  with Newton next weekend, because he and I, we, we text most days a little bit here and
62.24s:  there at least.
63.84s:  So I can always run some of the stuff by him as well and ask him to cover some of the
68.00s:  questions and want his videos.
70.20s:  He's awesome, right?
71.28s:  So I just wanted to be super, super clear that I have a very limited knowledge about the
78.60s:  subject, the goal for today is to learn more about it.
81.96s:  And also to hang out with you guys, I find the more I hang around the ape community,
86.80s:  the really that the happy RIM, I think overall, I have to be honest, I've been in markets
94.64s:  for a while and I've already mentioned this before, but it's not super, it's not super
102.08s:  frequent where I come across elements of markets that are like generally foreign to me.
107.60s:  And this is that in a lot of ways.
109.76s:  A lot of the things that you all are looking at are highly, highly unique to the ape community,
116.44s:  to the game stock community, which is very cool to me because I've said this before.
122.24s:  If you look at other kinds of market participants and you ask them like, Hey, explain to me what
126.80s:  a FTD is or explain to me the concept of an ETF creation and redemption cycle.
133.72s:  Like they won't know that.
136.00s:  Most people don't know that stuff.
138.12s:  And that's been one of the cool things from my perspective is I'm getting an opportunity
141.36s:  to learn more about that stuff with you guys.
144.68s:  So overall, that's the goal of the session.
146.88s:  So I have a handful of things on my docket that I specifically want to cover and learn
151.36s:  more about.
153.12s:  And then we can dive further into whatever offshoots you guys have.
157.72s:  So I would ask that if there are like specific resources, specific Reddit posts, anything
164.68s:  like that that you think is useful for us to take a look at or for me just to help me
168.24s:  understand more about the story.
169.68s:  I would love it.
170.88s:  And please throw that in the chat.
172.44s:  So the first thing I want to start with though is just taking a closer look at the Andrew
179.20s:  left case and Citroen research.
181.92s:  Then I want to take a look specifically at there is a video brought up to me by Rowan
188.16s:  Kitty about like a spreadsheet that he uses like his tools.
192.48s:  I think it was in this.
194.72s:  Yeah.
195.72s:  So they mentioned that he has like this really intricate series of tools that he uses.
202.52s:  So I want to take a look at that.
205.12s:  And then I want to talk a little bit about Chewie because there's a lot of conversation
210.52s:  around the movement of capital between those two positions.
213.48s:  And obviously they're very interesting to me.
216.20s:  So those are the main topics I have.
218.52s:  And then like I said, we'll go left right wherever else you guys you guys take me.
223.80s:  So welcome.
225.84s:  And I'm stoked to spend some time looking at GameStop learning more about I got to say hello
230.88s:  to everybody.
231.88s:  Joe says is it starting now?
233.12s:  It is.
234.12s:  Yeah, that's that's actually what this is.
235.56s:  It's a great question.
237.12s:  Zach says how believable do you think most of the D.D. on Reddit is I want to believe
241.28s:  it, but I'm not sure.
243.40s:  As much as I love Newton, every big jump over the past few months has a clear arcade catalyst.
248.24s:  Yeah.
249.24s:  So this is a great question.
252.92s:  And again, I want to be abundantly clear.
255.64s:  I am not the authority on any of this stuff, right?
257.92s:  So I'm going to share what I can from my background in trading and just my market analysis.
264.96s:  But I do not pretend to be the oracle on any of this stuff when I look at a lot of the
270.08s:  due diligence on Reddit.
272.28s:  I see a mix of things.
274.20s:  I see a lot of people trying to solve a really difficult puzzle.
280.76s:  I also see a lot of people scouring all ends of available information to come up with
289.72s:  ideas.
291.92s:  I also see a lot of overfitting.
296.40s:  I see a lot of pattern seeking.
298.80s:  I see a lot of oversimplification.
302.48s:  I see a lot of cognitive bias that comes out in a lot of the analysis that I see.
308.32s:  And it's not because it's game stop analysis.
310.56s:  It's because it's human analysis.
312.72s:  And it's being conducted by a lot of people that are trying really hard.
316.48s:  And they're coming across a lot of great pieces of information.
320.68s:  But I do think a lot of those data points, you like, let me put it this way.
326.48s:  I haven't found at least yet.
328.80s:  And it might be there.
330.12s:  But I haven't found like a comprehensive piece of due diligence that I follow it all
336.36s:  the way through.
337.36s:  And I'm like, yeah, okay, this is connecting some serious dots for me.
342.80s:  Each piece of DD that I read, it adds puzzles that I can fit into the whole picture, right?
350.40s:  So if I'm trying to finish a puzzle, I can get a couple pieces from this, one a couple
355.16s:  pieces from this, one a couple pieces from this one.
357.88s:  And that's literally just because not only is the system highly complicated, which I think
362.68s:  we've talked about, but there's an even bigger reason than that.
367.24s:  And it stems a lot from the fact that we're dealing with a system where people don't
373.76s:  follow the rules.
375.68s:  And again, like we can clearly see that.
378.76s:  And the reason why that matters is because that's happening, how can you solve a problem
383.96s:  set like that with standard analysis per se?
390.64s:  And you know that you're kind of playing a game where the other counterparties aren't
397.16s:  really following the rules.
399.64s:  So it makes it really complex, I think.
402.48s:  So the short synopsis of that specifically your question, Zach, I think a lot of it is
410.00s:  very believable.
411.36s:  I think almost every piece of DD on there has tons of great data and believable components
417.44s:  to it, no doubt.
419.04s:  Do I think that they are fully comprehensive and fully depict what we're looking at?
424.16s:  No, I don't.
425.92s:  And more over than that, and I talk to Newton about this actually, because there's another
430.36s:  thing I think is going on, which is who doesn't want to be the one to get it right.
437.76s:  Because I think that that incentivizes people on places like Superstong or GameStop.
443.00s:  And that's actually another question I have for you guys.
446.76s:  I'm trying to understand more about the differentiation between these communities.
452.44s:  Because I actually don't fully grasp that.
455.96s:  And again, I'm coming at this from an outsider perspective.
459.68s:  I'm trying to learn.
460.88s:  So if I say anything in the process of this that is offensive or sounds ignorant, it
465.36s:  is because I'm highly ignorant on the topic.
467.96s:  But I don't actually understand this.
470.72s:  Like why are these two different places not like joined?
476.92s:  Because everything that I can see from Superstong seems to be about GameStop.
482.44s:  And I see that that's in the description here.
485.04s:  And I think Newton explained a little bit about the breakoff between Superstong from Walls
491.96s:  Street bats.
492.96s:  So that part I get to a degree, I think.
496.04s:  But this one I don't fully understand.
499.92s:  And the other thing is I don't actually know who came first.
502.76s:  I guess is there a way for me to see that here?
506.16s:  So Ruta Biggest says divergencies.
507.80s:  Okay, so it's just slightly different, slightly different perspectives on what they can focus
513.12s:  on.
514.12s:  Eric, what up?
515.12s:  Eric says usually people ban from Superstong head over to GME.
518.76s:  Okay, got it.
520.36s:  That's helpful.
521.68s:  So and then Gravitt Terris says I've noticed Superstong is a bit more hardcore.
527.28s:  Interesting.
528.76s:  I also wouldn't have guessed that.
530.76s:  So that's really helpful context for me.
532.64s:  So I appreciate it.
533.64s:  Thank you.
534.64s:  Yeah, I was just trying to understand how these two communities operated in conjunction with
538.12s:  one another because they both have really interesting data sets.
542.04s:  What I like to do in here when I'm trying to learn more about this stuff is I just go
545.44s:  on to the top posts of all time and see what we have.
552.32s:  So this is, that's interesting.
558.16s:  And this is another interesting component that I find is that like there is just a universal
563.80s:  hate towards this homey, which makes sense to be clear that that also doesn't surprise
568.76s:  me at all.
569.76s:  Zach says there's also one called DFV.
571.80s:  I've seen the DFV one.
573.64s:  That one looks to be a little bit different in tone, at least as far as I could tell.
580.04s:  But yeah, it looks like it looks like what I could see across these two communities,
585.80s:  there's a lot of similarities, right?
587.48s:  Like literally this, the top handful of posts are from the homey DFV and then we just
593.60s:  immediately go to essentially hating this dude, which is awesome.
597.12s:  I love that.
598.20s:  And that's another thing that I was talking to about with Newton is I think it's awesome
602.96s:  that there's just this very distinct common enemy.
606.36s:  I always love me a good common enemy.
608.44s:  It's the greatest when people with all different backgrounds can unite and just hate one person
613.64s:  or one thing that objectively probably is not super great.
617.04s:  It's awesome.
618.04s:  Big fan.
619.40s:  So yeah, this is one of the things I was noticing.
623.24s:  All right.
624.24s:  So back up to Zach, I think that was as much of the question as at least as far as I
627.80s:  can think of right now.
630.68s:  Jonathan says, have you seen a single deep dive pan out?
633.76s:  That was actually a question I was going to have for you guys because I personally have
637.00s:  not.
638.00s:  And I think it's because there's a lot of elements.
641.00s:  And I think a lot of people really, really, really want to be the person that solves it.
645.24s:  And what that means is if you're trying to do that, it becomes like how many darts can
649.52s:  you throw out the dart board and how many of them will stick, right?
653.04s:  And I made a comment about that in the GME video I did yesterday where people are incentivized
659.36s:  to guess a lot because I can tell you what will happen is as soon as one person guesses
666.28s:  a meaningful portion of this correct, that's all that they will care about.
672.72s:  And the preceding track record of, you know, X number of missed guesses doesn't matter
677.12s:  anymore.
678.12s:  And I'm not saying whether it should or shouldn't, but it's just how kind of the human brain
682.00s:  works with stuff like this, which I can't help but find kind of kind of interesting.
690.96s:  I'm just catching up on the chat to see if there's anything else.
696.68s:  Mike says, hi, what up, Mike, it's you.
698.84s:  All right, let me get back up here.
703.72s:  MoneyTing says Ken Griffin is a fraud.
705.56s:  Him and his current manipulative intake advantage.
707.48s:  You're up back to our policies.
708.48s:  Yeah.
709.48s:  And again, to me, I really try to avoid being too hyperbolic and stuff, but I cannot,
716.84s:  but I cannot help but see the same thing there.
720.08s:  So one of the things I notice about, well, first let me, actually we can do that.
730.36s:  So there's two things I want to share with you guys.
732.20s:  If you guys haven't seen it, there's a video that I was going to share.
736.68s:  This one is, it's kind of long, but it's a, it's a really, really good video that I think
742.24s:  is worth your time, which is this one.
745.60s:  This one is about FTDs.
748.44s:  If you guys haven't seen this, I assume pretty much, I'm probably the last person on Earth
753.12s:  to have come across this with you guys.
755.16s:  But if, if that's not the case, I think you guys should take a look at this because this
759.76s:  dude does just an absolutely fantastic job of describing this process of FTDs, naked
767.16s:  short selling and stuff like that.
768.76s:  If you guys want to go through this in a little bit, I am very, very happy to do that.
775.20s:  So let's focus on a couple starting points here.
780.24s:  I guess one of the things that I wanted to do was actually start with one of these
785.52s:  older, roaring kitty videos because this was shot in quite a bit earlier.
793.00s:  And I think, so I was going through his old videos.
796.56s:  And one of the things that I find fantastic and super disenfranchising at the same time
802.04s:  is that he has 85 videos and like a million subscribers, which is, I mean, it's a joke,
807.28s:  it's awesome.
808.28s:  The dude is awesome.
809.28s:  And he should have every single one of those.
811.60s:  Well, I'm not subscribed.
813.36s:  We just got to turn that off.
815.96s:  Anyways, we, I love this.
821.08s:  And one of the funny things is when I look at this stuff, it's like, I was looking at
826.76s:  the views and I can see this stuff that you guys cared a lot about.
831.28s:  And then the things that didn't really hit the Richter scale, which I also found that
836.56s:  pretty interesting.
837.56s:  I wanted to ask about some of this.
840.52s:  But anyways, this is the video I wanted to start with.
843.84s:  So I'm going to, I'm only going to show you, I'm going to pause this.
848.72s:  I'm going to make sure that you guys can hear it through here.
851.92s:  A quick admin note, YouTube sometimes can be really weird about copyright infringement,
858.12s:  which I don't care.
859.12s:  Like if that happens, he, it doesn't matter to me in terms of like ad revenue.
862.64s:  Like I don't even put ads in for this, right?
865.16s:  There's a thing right now for YouTube that says, focus on your live stream and let YouTube
868.56s:  insert ads for you.
869.56s:  I literally always dismiss it.
871.36s:  But anyways, all that is to say that the, that I think YouTube looks at this stuff really
875.08s:  carefully.
876.08s:  So if the stream cuts, I essentially just have to turn this off and then they'll turn
880.52s:  the stream back on.
882.04s:  I've had that happen with during the Apple Vision Pro thing, I was looking at it.
889.44s:  And essentially that happened.
890.60s:  So if we cut out for a second, that's what's going on, just a quick heads up.
894.04s:  But I want to watch through some of this.
897.08s:  For you guys, if there's specific pieces in here or elements of this that you want us
901.28s:  to focus on, let me know.
903.44s:  When I was listening to this, there was a couple of things that I really found interesting.
908.60s:  And this is just from a background perspective, right?
910.64s:  So I know that he has a little bit of a financial background.
915.04s:  And I know that he started out his journey as a very, very heavy, heavy, value investor,
923.52s:  which is interesting to me.
926.44s:  And when I look at this, I can see how that starts.
932.00s:  But then he talked about some of this stuff in here about his movement from value investing,
937.52s:  which I thought was super interesting.
939.16s:  So I typically listen to things at two times speed.
942.56s:  I think that that might be a little too fast for some people for the uninitiated.
947.24s:  It might sound just like gibberish.
949.08s:  So maybe I'll do like one and a half and see how you guys feel about one and a half.
958.24s:  Because obviously it's a two hour video.
959.60s:  We're not going to get through the whole thing.
960.84s:  I want to kind of find through a couple of different spots.
963.44s:  Are you the main ones?
965.00s:  Okay.
966.00s:  So the three, let's see if I can show each one quickly without diving into each one.
969.12s:  I'm secretly excited about this.
970.80s:  Because what happens is, what gets pulled into the universe is only the latest iteration
975.32s:  of a particular company.
976.32s:  So that's why I have to have data there.
978.00s:  I don't think I'm going to make more than one submission per day.
980.20s:  I just come to the DB and edit it there.
982.92s:  So what are you talking about here?
983.92s:  Super cool.
984.92s:  And I love this.
985.92s:  It's actually kind of similar to what I do, but it's a different approach.
990.56s:  But he has kind of individual data components.
993.88s:  It seems that he's aggregating up to a very specific view that he wants to co-late and have
1000.72s:  data in one spot.
1001.96s:  Super efficient makes it ton of sense.
1003.48s:  So that's why you're always going to have a few on the universe.
1005.28s:  It's only taking a latest version.
1006.28s:  It's going to be good to get yours.
1007.28s:  And then some things I'm not tracking are getting to it on something tab, but it is.
1012.28s:  And so the way this should work, like this is, what I've worked with, I've worked with
1015.48s:  some serious developers in the past, like legitimate bad ass programmers.
1018.84s:  They've like, each rent like millions of lines of codes.
1021.32s:  And so in spreadsheets, some of you may look at this, but it's kind of nice, right?
1024.04s:  But like in my mind, I think of these two guys in particular who are looking at this,
1027.36s:  they're like, all right, yeah, that's pretty basic stuff.
1029.40s:  And anyway, what I'm doing here is just to be done so much more simply and efficiently
1032.36s:  elsewhere.
1033.36s:  But this is how I do it in spreadsheets.
1034.36s:  And for me, it's really helpful.
1036.20s:  That's another funny thing that he's talking about here.
1038.28s:  I couldn't agree more with him just from the idea of doing this stuff in spreadsheets.
1042.88s:  Also, I want to make sure the audio is coming through for you guys when I'm playing this.
1046.36s:  Let me know if there's any audio issues from his side.
1050.40s:  Now one of the things that I agree with him on just from a broader trading perspective
1054.48s:  is the idea of using spreadsheets.
1056.08s:  I still use them.
1057.08s:  I can automate way more of what I do if I so choose.
1060.24s:  But you'll find that there's a lot of traders in my case that have kind of do this as
1065.84s:  like our primary income source, right?
1069.16s:  We try to remain close to the information.
1072.68s:  And if you're not at the institutional level that's moving just massive size where you're
1077.40s:  literally prohibited from being that close to the data, I find some very, very commonalities
1084.96s:  between us where we like to manually input what we can.
1089.04s:  But we automate a lot of the inputs as well.
1091.56s:  So it's kind of a mix between still a manual process and automated.
1097.24s:  But like the overwhelming majority of friends that I have that are in this business with
1101.16s:  me, they do the same thing.
1102.64s:  They use spreadsheets.
1103.64s:  All right, back to this.
1106.28s:  And hopefully you might be able to do this on the stuff if you care.
1108.68s:  I like to think you're watching this video.
1110.68s:  You care, but I don't know.
1111.68s:  So I do care.
1112.68s:  That's the DB tab.
1113.68s:  Okay, so let's go to the submit tab.
1116.04s:  The submit tab is where I'll submit to the database.
1119.12s:  So let's say so when I first of all, anything below this black line, right?
1122.84s:  So he's just kind of talking about his approach on how he's filling in information.
1128.36s:  This all makes sense to me.
1131.36s:  I'm just skipping through to see the pull up and I'm spreadsheet.
1136.20s:  Just one, everything ready for me in some tax example.
1138.72s:  I was getting tired of typing the same shit over and over again.
1140.92s:  So I wanted a, was this a script that I found?
1143.72s:  I was using, I was complimenting, I think it was either a Google form.
1146.40s:  I think it was Google form.
1147.40s:  It doesn't matter both of great.
1148.40s:  But watch this.
1149.40s:  I get a rank.
1150.40s:  So like that rank anything up there.
1151.40s:  Most of the rank things put in there for you.
1152.40s:  But this actually does show sidebar.
1153.40s:  Let's check this out.
1154.40s:  It was most helpful.
1155.40s:  There's a bit of work for the unit.
1156.40s:  So this looks like mostly about just data input.
1159.80s:  Yeah, that's great.
1161.80s:  So it's so dumb.
1162.80s:  And then so now it's in there.
1163.80s:  And I just, nice roll over.
1164.80s:  Well, I got a scroll because this is open.
1166.80s:  You know, I don't like scroll.
1167.80s:  So I'm going to text out and I click submit and watch this.
1168.80s:  And now it should, it should submit it over and then clear out this.
1171.72s:  And then it should, it should clear out that whole blue row.
1174.24s:  And that went to part of the script.
1175.64s:  It takes a little bit time to run some of the, let's go check on the DB.
1177.40s:  We should see see you on the bottom.
1178.72s:  There it is.
1179.72s:  Yeah, that's super cool.
1181.20s:  So this is over viewing general approach he has to inputting the data.
1187.60s:  Zach says if we type in the URL at the top, can we go to his spreadsheet?
1190.72s:  No, I doubt it.
1192.12s:  Because that's where he's accessing his spreadsheet.
1197.00s:  And more likely than not, you will not have access to it.
1200.96s:  Because it's going to be probably on his Google Drive.
1203.96s:  And unless he externally shares it like under his own volition, it won't be available to
1209.12s:  you.
1210.12s:  All right, I got to stand up for a second.
1212.20s:  For those that don't know, your boys working with a fresh, herniated desk.
1216.44s:  So we got to move around a little bit, keep these hip flexors nice and loose.
1220.56s:  Although, as I just get this really fun random pain that starts shooting around, it's
1225.60s:  kind of like a fun game.
1227.36s:  I like to see where it goes and how debilitating it is.
1238.20s:  Which is moderately so.
1239.92s:  All right, let's take a look at some of the chat here.
1244.20s:  Obviously, I'm happy to go through this as much as we want.
1246.28s:  If we want to move on to something else we can, you guys let me know.
1248.88s:  Right now, I'm just kind of getting a sense of how he analyzes information.
1252.28s:  That's what I'm personally deriving from this.
1256.24s:  Roland says hello, yo, what up?
1257.80s:  Roland, good to see you.
1261.16s:  Roland says I have a question about buying calls on ETFs.
1264.08s:  I'm thinking on IWM, Sep or no slightly at the money.
1267.92s:  Yeah, what about it?
1268.92s:  Obviously, we can take a look at that.
1271.84s:  No problem.
1273.44s:  Running DGN says, hope you recover, okay?
1276.24s:  Scott says, Ralph, hope he heals.
1277.76s:  Yeah, you and me both.
1278.76s:  I got to be honest with you.
1280.64s:  It's not any big surprise, especially after a bunch of time in the Marine Corps, you
1284.52s:  kind of beat the shit out of the body.
1288.00s:  So it does not surprise me, but yeah, you know, you know, it goes.
1292.76s:  Got to, got to rehab.
1294.48s:  I'm still super, super active.
1296.12s:  So this one I think was from training, just like, like, lifting somebody to slam them,
1300.92s:  but I did it in such a way that the body was a little tired.
1305.08s:  So yeah, that's enough about me.
1306.60s:  Nobody cares.
1307.60s:  I don't care.
1309.28s:  So let's take a look through the rest of this.
1313.60s:  So this is all general value.
1315.36s:  He said something in the beginning.
1316.52s:  I think I might have skipped it.
1317.52s:  Let me go back.
1318.52s:  The three.
1319.52s:  Let's see if I can show you each one quickly.
1322.72s:  That Lauren says Ben from the knees.
1324.60s:  Yeah.
1325.60s:  Unfortunately, that's that like really old bad gouge because a lot of a lot of the reason
1330.84s:  why people start to have herniated disc unlike people like me, because it's, it's a completely
1335.24s:  different, a completely different reason, right?
1338.28s:  Like people that end up generally herniating discs are if they're not in good shape and
1343.32s:  they actually don't bend over their back and stuff and they become too rigid.
1348.72s:  People like me, it's a little bit more of just overuse and impact, right?
1353.52s:  Like I still lift every day, train most days.
1357.00s:  So yeah, I mean, you're going to have injuries.
1359.20s:  That's the South of Chicago's.
1364.68s:  Max says would you care to plug the software you trade with while you choose it over others?
1368.24s:  Yeah, I use thinkorswim.
1369.24s:  I mean, it's not really much of a plug.
1371.60s:  That's it in the background.
1373.16s:  And we can take a look through this, you know, if you guys are interested at all, but I
1377.88s:  use it because thinkorswim is a good platform.
1380.08s:  That's really the punchline.
1386.88s:  Let me play this real quick because I think there's something he says.
1389.16s:  I'm secretly excited about this.
1391.16s:  Because like the hoops out of the trunk are going to save a couple of clicks.
1393.36s:  I hate scrolling.
1394.36s:  I want to say, well, we'll talk about how powerful these spreadsheets are after the
1399.04s:  fact.
1400.04s:  I don't consider them as powerful.
1401.04s:  They can just do a lot.
1402.04s:  That's all.
1403.04s:  But I like to try to build them out so that I don't have to do as much work as you'll
1406.04s:  see.
1407.04s:  I don't talk to explain.
1408.04s:  But anyway, let me get into it.
1409.04s:  Let me start wasting your time.
1410.04s:  We'll get into the spreadsheets.
1411.04s:  We'll start with track spreadsheet here.
1412.04s:  You may have seen me mention that most of my process is just tracking stuff.
1413.04s:  And so I need a spreadsheet to facilitate that tracking.
1416.28s:  And there's a whole bunch of stuff in here.
1418.08s:  We'll spend most of our time, I think, in this spreadsheet.
1419.76s:  I also have...
1421.84s:  Also, can we give a quick shout out to the fact that...
1428.76s:  Can we give a shout out to the fact that he has a white t-shirt and a white hat on?
1433.84s:  I can't have white clothing for more than like a week because apparently I'm a fucking
1438.76s:  child and it always gets dirty somehow.
1441.96s:  I always think it's like a magnet for dust.
1445.24s:  So the fact that my boy is decked out in this white kit is inspiring to me.
1449.80s:  Another type of spreadsheet that is like six or seven of them, in fact I found a report
1452.92s:  time, like a one, two, three, four, five, six of these types of spreadsheets where I analyze
1455.64s:  fundamentals, okay?
1457.96s:  And that's what this spreadsheet is.
1459.56s:  And I'll show you this one, this is where I'm analyzing the business and historical profitability
1463.20s:  and trying to realize everything to inform me.
1464.72s:  I don't have estimate values.
1465.72s:  I could do that where it might be.
1467.04s:  I put together some formulas and forecasts where the value could be.
1469.24s:  I sell them for you.
1470.24s:  It doesn't matter.
1471.88s:  And then there's the universal spreadsheet.
1473.88s:  In the universe spreadsheet, a little bit less exciting.
1474.88s:  It's kind of like maintenance stuff.
1476.40s:  And I submitted it to my DB and I take notes on it.
1480.52s:  And yeah, so what are I showing you?
1482.04s:  Interesting universe and DB.
1483.04s:  So let me just start with this spreadsheet.
1484.04s:  I think that makes the most sense.
1485.04s:  And they're all connected.
1486.04s:  They're all connected in weird ways.
1487.04s:  You'll see, we'll just start with this spreadsheet.
1489.36s:  And so let's start with 3, 4, 20 first.
1492.68s:  I say 3,500.
1493.68s:  I don't know.
1494.68s:  Sometimes it was like a swaner, it was more than that.
1495.68s:  It used to be like 2,500.
1496.68s:  I started with like a run.
1497.68s:  He had a really interesting video.
1501.20s:  He had a really, really interesting video.
1502.96s:  I wish I could find it.
1503.96s:  I don't know if it's in here or if it's somewhere else.
1509.28s:  But there was a video where he was talking about his approach.
1513.28s:  I thought it was in this.
1517.28s:  So anyways, I think it's in this video somewhere.
1519.60s:  I just don't know exactly where it's at.
1521.00s:  But here's what I remember.
1522.56s:  He was talking about his basis as like, it might have been like how he does things.
1528.76s:  There was one of them this.
1529.76s:  Is this it?
1530.76s:  Hey, what's up everybody?
1532.76s:  I wanted to make a video about my investments.
1535.04s:  Like a high level overview of my investments.
1536.56s:  I think this one's it.
1537.56s:  I feel like some people might join the live stream expecting excitement or some big creating,
1541.68s:  hot stock tips or stuff like that.
1543.00s:  And you're going to need to disappoint because it's not going to be like that.
1545.40s:  I'll drop this bomb when you're ready to start.
1546.88s:  I'm a valiant investor.
1547.88s:  And I feel like some of you are rolling your eyes out and laughing at me.
1550.28s:  You're bastards.
1551.28s:  I'm just kidding, I don't care.
1552.28s:  I'll just say this.
1553.28s:  I'm not a traditional valiant investor.
1554.80s:  And I jot it down a couple of reasons why.
1556.64s:  And the first is, I'm not in the can that things value has been underperforming.
1559.36s:  I actually think it's been tremendously successful over the past decade.
1561.64s:  So I think it's one of the ones who's headlines is value dead.
1563.64s:  It's like, does it come back?
1565.20s:  So this, yeah, so this is it.
1567.44s:  In this video, he talks about the origin of his value investing philosophy and then between
1572.52s:  this and that spreadsheet video, he actually starts talking about how he is like approach
1577.88s:  to value investing has changed.
1580.88s:  And he doesn't really think that highly of it is much anymore.
1583.96s:  And he essentially was talking about how he would find that he would go through this rigorous
1588.60s:  process of valuing something and then it just wouldn't happen.
1591.60s:  And I thought that that was really interesting for two reasons.
1594.28s:  One, with his background, and I honestly, I don't know how old he is at this point is four
1599.52s:  years ago.
1600.52s:  He looks super young, but I also just aged terribly.
1604.08s:  So that he might be the same ages as me.
1606.92s:  I have no idea.
1609.16s:  But the, I don't know how old he is and I don't know how long he's been in markets, but
1613.52s:  I know that he's savvy.
1615.76s:  Even at this point, this four years end point, and I can tell by a lot of what he's doing,
1619.28s:  obviously.
1620.28s:  The reason why I say that is because it surprises me to hear the evolution in his thoughts of
1627.16s:  value investing, essentially between this timeframe.
1629.60s:  I mean, I just took that as somewhat noteworthy.
1632.72s:  I thought it was interesting.
1636.28s:  Coffee Donut says, is it a service connected injury?
1638.88s:  It's a great question.
1639.88s:  I, he's talking about my back.
1641.36s:  I, I think it's like something that probably started a while ago with general stress and
1645.56s:  strain.
1646.56s:  And then I think it just came to a head really.
1648.84s:  Because the dude that I was picking up was pretty fucking heavy to be honest with you.
1653.56s:  So yeah.
1657.60s:  Let's see.
1658.92s:  Ape of trade, Cicero has unusual high options, volume for short term dates.
1663.28s:  Isn't it in the XRT ETF with GME?
1666.36s:  So a couple of things.
1667.76s:  I actually don't know what's in XRT anymore.
1671.84s:  Let's see.
1672.84s:  Because I think it recently changed.
1675.40s:  So let's take a look at XRT holdings.
1681.48s:  Because let me see.
1691.52s:  I have to download all the holdings.
1693.16s:  That's what I'm grabbing right now for you guys.
1697.60s:  Cool.
1705.60s:  And then I'm just opening up the excel sheet.
1708.60s:  Cool.
1709.60s:  All right.
1710.60s:  So this is as of 25 July.
1715.12s:  So let's see what's in this bad boy.
1716.72s:  First let's check out what GME holding it has.
1719.64s:  How much?
1720.64s:  So right now it's holding.
1724.12s:  I assume this is shares.
1726.64s:  Yeah, okay.
1727.92s:  The 164,000 shares.
1732.60s:  So it's just really not that much.
1736.04s:  So in this case, big A saying should have pulled guard.
1740.72s:  That is like the most offensive thing I've ever heard in my life.
1744.88s:  Oh God.
1745.88s:  And you know that too.
1746.96s:  You know that that's going to piss me off.
1748.84s:  I can't even deal with that.
1753.20s:  Now it wouldn't surprise me though if we see Craig Jones pull guard with Gabi Garcia.
1757.32s:  I think that would be hilarious.
1759.28s:  But anyways, so this is holding a relatively small amount of GameStop.
1767.76s:  So it's like 1.12% of the ETF.
1770.92s:  It's I'm using this as like a line for you guys so you could see.
1775.00s:  And then the other question is is Siri in here and Siri is not in here.
1780.24s:  I didn't think so.
1781.60s:  So no, Siri obviously would be in other ETFs.
1785.32s:  But oh shit, Siri is now listening to me.
1788.28s:  That's sketchy bro.
1789.28s:  My phone literally started listening in.
1791.32s:  Obviously it's already already listening.
1794.68s:  But yeah, okay, so I don't see that here.
1800.04s:  Fun fact.
1803.84s:  Adam says IWB, we can take a look.
1811.60s:  Holdings.
1818.60s:  Detailed holdings.
1823.20s:  IWB.
1824.36s:  It's funny.
1825.36s:  I literally have all these downloaded already, but I don't know where they are.
1829.20s:  All right, let's see.
1830.20s:  Jimmy.
1831.20s:  Damn it.
1832.20s:  Back up to the top.
1834.20s:  I hate that.
1836.84s:  So I'm just expanding all these so that I can see like what it actually is.
1842.28s:  Wait, actually, I guess we literally could just filter by up here.
1847.40s:  That would be kind of nice because this way we can see both of them side by side.
1854.24s:  So let's get rid of that.
1857.20s:  And then let's look at Jimmy.
1861.52s:  I didn't know what Jimmy D was.
1868.00s:  That's interesting.
1869.00s:  All right, so let's go back in here and let's grab just Jimmy this time for real.
1874.28s:  And then let's grab C of series in here.
1877.32s:  It is.
1878.32s:  So, okay, now I'm confused.
1886.72s:  How is this the case?
1889.36s:  So this is telling me that it's zero weight, notional values.
1898.68s:  How is it zero weight?
1899.88s:  Does it just miss and does most here?
1906.36s:  It'll me that Batman.
1908.36s:  How does that make sense?
1916.56s:  I mean, I get that it would be so small, right?
1919.24s:  So right now I'm looking at the holdings on this here.
1925.12s:  And obviously it shows the weight, but it just doesn't make sense because the weight
1931.24s:  on this is 0.01%.
1934.60s:  There should be a third or fourth decimal, right?
1937.64s:  Because the market value here is 2.4 versus 1.6.
1942.40s:  That's not that far apart.
1944.04s:  So they should have a third decimal or fourth decimal if they need, but they just cut
1948.56s:  it at 2.
1949.56s:  So the cliff notes of that is they're both in here for sure, but this is obviously so,
1959.64s:  so, so, so light weighted that they didn't include the decimals, which I mean, I have
1964.56s:  to be honest with you, it's kind of annoying.
1966.08s:  I wish they did.
1972.92s:  And GameStop is also very, very small.
1976.12s:  GameStop is 0.01%.
1980.12s:  So Scott Copeland says I guess it's weighted as a 0, 0, x, yeah, but like I thought they
1985.52s:  would at least, because when I downloaded it from the website, it says that this is like
1989.88s:  the detailed holdings, right?
1991.72s:  So like where's the fucking detail?
1993.12s:  I would like to be able to see the, I'd like to be able to see it.
1997.48s:  Ryan O'Ducks says 0.00% is tiny.
1999.92s:  Yeah, definitely.
2000.92s:  Well, it's okay, that's actually incorrect.
2003.64s:  So it's, that means it's tiny as it relates to the underlying.
2008.84s:  But when you're talking about products like this, I'm just differentiating, right?
2012.08s:  Like I don't think you should draw the conclusion that linearly, although I think in this case,
2016.28s:  it's not wrong.
2017.68s:  So in this case, though, because like for example, let me just give you a null.
2023.84s:  The null example here is what if the, the ETF that it's in is massive, absolutely
2031.24s:  massive.
2032.64s:  You can have something that's weighted really lightly, but still represent a large gross
2037.28s:  position.
2038.28s:  Again, this is not that.
2039.56s:  I want to be clear, this is not that.
2041.60s:  And I agree with you, Ryan O'Ducks, which is also, I have to be honest, one of the like
2047.70s:  picturing a fucking Ryan O'Ducks is awesome.
2050.52s:  I don't know.
2051.52s:  Actually, let's, we have to look real quick.
2053.32s:  Should we run that through, what do you think, chat GPT?
2057.36s:  Something like that?
2059.12s:  Let me see, Ryan O'Ducks.
2060.92s:  I just gotta see what they look like.
2064.40s:  Hey, they look kind of cool.
2067.64s:  In case you guys were wondering where our friend Ryan O'Ducks is from, is this thing, which
2073.64s:  I like a lot, but things pretty sick.
2075.48s:  We're like this little cute Ryan O'Ducks.
2078.28s:  Like that one too.
2080.32s:  But yeah, so anyways, the punchline though, is, I'm not sure if I'm gonna say that,
2083.20s:  but the point is, our friend Ryan O'Ducks is spot on.
2085.44s:  Like these are very small, but they're not small just because it's a lightweight of the
2090.72s:  ETF.
2091.72s:  I just wouldn't draw that conclusion.
2092.72s:  That would infer that it's small relative to this ETF, of course, but it could still
2098.68s:  be a large gross position.
2100.92s:  In this case, it does not look like much.
2104.48s:  This I see 450K on Siri shares and then 190 games up.
2110.96s:  So that's the problem with this redemption cycle is it's difficult.
2117.16s:  It's actually quite difficult to navigate for them.
2120.96s:  I think we can kill this one.
2124.36s:  That's so funny.
2125.36s:  I just every time I see this, I can't help but laugh.
2128.60s:  I wanted to revisit another part of this because there's been a lot of kind of follow-on
2132.84s:  questions about it.
2135.68s:  It looks like we need to take a look at Ryan O'Ducks in Dalley.
2141.28s:  You guys got it.
2142.28s:  Give me one sec.
2143.28s:  We'll grab some Dalley.
2150.08s:  Start chat.
2151.08s:  Okay.
2152.08s:  Create an image of a game stop inspired.
2159.12s:  Ryan O'Ducks.
2161.12s:  All right.
2165.08s:  Do we get generating image?
2175.68s:  Oh, wow.
2179.68s:  What do you guys think?
2184.00s:  This is like they need to combine it.
2187.32s:  So we need to edit this and it needs to be an inspired combined.
2192.92s:  Ryan O'Ducks.
2195.84s:  Except maybe I need to spell combined right.
2198.84s:  That might help.
2202.84s:  Well, that's a yo-grino.
2207.60s:  All right.
2208.60s:  Let's see.
2209.60s:  I didn't spell right.
2210.60s:  That was my fault.
2214.20s:  Let's see.
2216.20s:  League says, can you advise on my fantasy football team?
2218.68s:  I know jack shit.
2220.24s:  Whoa.
2221.76s:  Fantasy football.
2223.08s:  Look at this thing.
2224.16s:  I like this one.
2225.80s:  It still looks very.
2227.20s:  This one's terrifying.
2228.20s:  I don't like this one.
2229.20s:  This one gets a thumbs down.
2230.20s:  I don't like that.
2231.48s:  This one I like because he has nice little feathers.
2233.48s:  Look at these little wings.
2234.80s:  I know that's another critter behind them.
2237.36s:  But I wish there was a little more duck going on.
2240.20s:  Rudebegg says first one is curse.
2241.56s:  Yeah.
2242.56s:  This one not a fan.
2243.56s:  This one is not a fan at all.
2244.92s:  It's very nerve-wracking.
2246.44s:  All right.
2247.44s:  Let's run a role more time.
2248.44s:  See what it comes up with and then we'll move on from this.
2252.76s:  But yeah, League, I know jack shit about football.
2258.40s:  I, oh God, these are.
2262.20s:  Oh my God.
2266.44s:  This looks like a mutant experiment.
2269.00s:  This nestled.
2270.00s:  All right.
2271.00s:  Let's try one more time.
2272.56s:  Let's try this one more time.
2274.00s:  So let's do GameStop inspired duck with a rhino.
2281.88s:  Head.
2282.64s:  I think this might get us closer on to target.
2285.56s:  Because that I don't like the nestled duck underneath.
2288.52s:  It sketches me out a little bit.
2291.16s:  That learns it's a rhino mallard.
2293.04s:  Yeah, there we go.
2294.96s:  This is more what I'm thinking about.
2297.28s:  He's look good.
2300.56s:  I like these a lot.
2301.68s:  These are good.
2302.64s:  All right.
2303.16s:  I'm pleased with this visual.
2305.92s:  I think that this looks good.
2308.72s:  I'll save this.
2311.16s:  So that we have that for our reference, whatever we possibly need that as a reference,
2316.44s:  but we have it.
2317.44s:  That's the important part.
2318.44s:  And nobody can take it from us.
2320.68s:  It is our reference.
2322.16s:  All right.
2324.60s:  Now back to this ETF thing.
2326.80s:  There's a reality behind this ETF redemption and creation cycle.
2334.44s:  So this is something that Newton has been starting to track more and more and more.
2338.56s:  If you guys don't know, Newton has this absolutely crazy, crazy GME sheet where he's tracking
2346.18s:  essentially everything.
2347.72s:  So I mean, I imagine all of you are familiar with this, but if you're not, it's literally
2352.12s:  accessible to everybody.
2354.24s:  And there's just a ton of great resources in here.
2358.92s:  It takes a while to even figure out how to read it to be completely honest with you,
2363.24s:  but it's worth, it's definitely worth your time if you're following this at all.
2367.72s:  Now again, this is a thing that he and I actually look at together quite often.
2372.60s:  And one of the things that I notice people do is they, they focus too much on positive
2380.52s:  identification and not enough on total correlation analysis.
2386.88s:  So what I've been doing is downloading the sheet so that I can run in a broader data
2393.80s:  set.
2394.80s:  And I'm looking at things like FTDs, I'm looking at redemption cycles.
2399.76s:  And I'm trying to understand like the actual correlations.
2403.64s:  It's important in my opinion to be as objectively is humanly, is objective is humanly possible.
2412.36s:  So what I mean by that is like some of the issues I see are like, there are a lot of instances
2416.76s:  where there's like these weird off cycle movements, meaning we might think that there's a tailwind
2422.48s:  of some sort or there might be some sort of crazy pop in ETF volume or something.
2429.32s:  But then it doesn't translate to anything.
2432.68s:  So sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't.
2435.36s:  And that's one of the really the anomalies that continues to go in with this.
2440.52s:  So we take a look, we, and I again, when I say we, it's I am nothing in this story.
2447.04s:  It's almost all Newton.
2449.92s:  I'm just running broader data analysis on the back end because there's a lot of individual
2455.08s:  things that you can look at that look really interesting to me.
2460.48s:  Ukraine says back to the topic, bro, what topic is this not, we're talking about GameStop.
2467.32s:  Ukraine, what should we be talking about?
2472.68s:  But so he's starting to build out this here.
2476.80s:  So we're trying to get a sense for all of these different ETFs and the FTD cycles.
2489.84s:  This is creation and redemption over here.
2494.96s:  So when I look at creation and redemption, this is another relatively new piece of the puzzle.
2500.68s:  Again, Newton has a lot, a lot of detail on this as is.
2505.76s:  But there does seem to be some interesting correlations here.
2509.48s:  But again, the issue that we have is that there are a lot of non flag events as well that
2515.04s:  happened.
2516.32s:  So I want to be, yeah, I want to be really clear about that because as I'm analyzing
2523.56s:  these larger data sets, there's instances where you see like massive, massive creation
2528.60s:  and redemption.
2530.12s:  But the other problem behind this is there's, it's not just limited to GameStop, right?
2539.84s:  That's one of the problems is when we see creation, redemption, it's not limited to just,
2547.70s:  to just this specific entity.
2550.96s:  So it's something to look at.
2553.08s:  It's something to try to bake into the picture.
2554.72s:  I think just out of curiosity.
2556.92s:  But I also don't think, yeah, I don't necessarily, I think there's a lot of noise is the way
2563.32s:  I should say that.
2567.36s:  Let me see.
2568.96s:  Markets says, can you talk about the upcoming 16-OGGME options who are back holding?
2574.68s:  Yeah, definitely.
2577.44s:  I can absolutely do that.
2579.88s:  That is, I'm way, way more well versed in that.
2585.40s:  Before we take a look at that though, Marquette, really quick.
2587.84s:  I just wanted to share a few studies with you guys.
2591.28s:  This one is really cool.
2595.44s:  So let me throw this in here.
2600.32s:  So these are all different papers.
2602.40s:  I shared a ton with Newton to include on like short squeezes, gamma squeezes.
2608.76s:  This is how I analyze information is I'm looking for broad objective data sets that I can
2614.24s:  then integrate into my own data set and try to learn.
2618.08s:  If you don't like reading white papers, this will be terribly annoying for you.
2621.52s:  I recommend just dropping it into chat GPT.
2624.60s:  But when you do that stuff with chat GPT, always ask it for what are the limitations of
2629.32s:  this research.
2630.32s:  Don't just say, what are the takeaways?
2633.28s:  Because if you just get the takeaways and you don't understand the limitations of the
2636.32s:  research, you're getting a highly skewed picture that I don't think is the best use of
2641.24s:  your time and effort.
2642.68s:  So yeah, anyways, I wanted to share those with you guys before we moved on.
2647.88s:  Okay, so now following up with Marquette asking about 16 all GME options.
2657.00s:  Yes, we can do that.
2658.60s:  I guess maybe we could start with just a quick broad overview.
2661.00s:  I'll do a lot of this in the in kind of like my standard video update tomorrow.
2665.28s:  So we don't have to go super far in depth.
2669.52s:  Also this is a Arnold Palmer.
2672.24s:  Absolutely fantastic, big fan.
2675.60s:  But right now, right now as I look at the stock, it's behaving strangely to me is what
2688.28s:  I think.
2689.84s:  And the reason why I say that is because the way that I'm noticing the volume coming
2695.48s:  through and the percentage of sale to buy volume and the price behavior of the underlying
2702.32s:  is very weird.
2704.08s:  So what I mean by that is let me get my ugly face out of your way so that you can see
2709.28s:  the volume down here clearly.
2711.84s:  And a few things stick out to me.
2714.72s:  One of them is notice all of the sale volume over the last, essentially from the 17th of
2722.16s:  July.
2723.36s:  We did have one slightly favorable day on the 22nd and then one more on the 23rd.
2728.20s:  But other than that, mostly sale volume.
2731.20s:  So sale volume on the 18th on the 19th, it was almost all sale volume, the overwhelming
2737.68s:  majority of volume that we saw that day literally was sale volume.
2743.04s:  And then we see on the 24th, majority sale volume yet again, and then also here on
2754.72s:  the 26th.
2756.52s:  So the reason why I think that's weird is because price isn't necessarily cratering as much
2764.36s:  as I would expect it to given that amount of sale volume.
2769.12s:  Now the total average volume is also being siphoned out heavily.
2773.24s:  And there's somebody sent me a theory that I think we should take a look at in a few
2776.68s:  minutes that I actually think is really, really important because they're starting at least
2782.64s:  out some of the things that I was told or I haven't looked at it yet.
2786.56s:  But some of the things that I think are in there will be slightly informative as we look
2790.20s:  at this.
2792.44s:  Punchline I see on a chart highly, highly range bound.
2797.52s:  And we are not necessarily, we're not making great headway here.
2804.24s:  I think we're at a bit of an inflection point here.
2807.56s:  And the reason why I think we're at a bit of an inflection point is because we're seeing
2812.32s:  a series of higher lows.
2815.80s:  And thankfully we pivoted here.
2818.92s:  Otherwise we would have broke down into a downtrend like a fully confirmed downtrend.
2823.76s:  But this isn't too, this doesn't look great still.
2829.84s:  And it's because we have the lower low here, higher lows, higher lows, we kind of hit a
2834.64s:  term high here.
2836.24s:  And it came back down.
2837.32s:  It essentially started testing previous lower lows.
2841.96s:  And it's still hovering down here.
2844.12s:  So what I'm highlighting is just in standard technical analysis, typically when something
2849.12s:  is in an uptrend, you'll see both higher highs and higher lows.
2853.76s:  You're going to expect to see lows, that's normal, but they're typically higher if something
2859.12s:  is in an uptrend.
2860.96s:  This is starting to look to me something that's in very much a sideways trend.
2866.00s:  Like we are just grinding sideways here.
2870.72s:  So I think in this case, the price behavior is strange is really the summary of that.
2877.96s:  Now if we take a look at the options, there's a bunch that sticks out to me.
2885.08s:  The first thing, I mean, just take a look at the OI after expiration.
2891.44s:  After expiration on Friday, we lost a ton of options as you would expect.
2899.48s:  But the call OI right now is 569, gigity.
2903.80s:  And the put OI is at 347.
2909.84s:  So from like an OI skew perspective, I don't actually love this.
2919.68s:  And the reason why I don't love this is because in my opinion, this is something that is
2927.00s:  very, very much starting now to trend sideways.
2933.80s:  And the options are also, they're backing that idea, which I don't love here.
2941.16s:  The reason why I say that is because I'm just, I'm not seeing the massive option skew
2947.36s:  that we typically see when GME is really poised to start moving higher.
2952.56s:  So when I see these almost at a one to one, that is fairly anomalous to what this looks.
2959.20s:  And I mean, let's take the time, right?
2960.40s:  Like we're in a livestream.
2961.40s:  Let's take a look at it together.
2962.60s:  Let's go back here to 3 May.
2965.68s:  And we'll go to on demand so that we can go back in time.
2969.20s:  And then let's go to 3 May.
2973.44s:  And I just want to, well, let's go to the second.
2975.64s:  Let's take a look at these options.
2980.40s:  Make says, I'm missing.
2987.40s:  I'll take a look.
2990.36s:  Oh, I see you copy.
2992.04s:  So GME is tracking AMC 2021 May.
2995.84s:  I don't know if I would make those comparisons personally.
2998.80s:  I could see why somebody might do that, but I don't think it actually makes a lot of sense.
3005.28s:  We can talk about it, but I wouldn't personally make that comparison.
3011.32s:  But this is what I wanted to show you guys.
3014.64s:  When GME stopped starting to get like really poised to move higher, take a look at the
3021.20s:  disposition and the options before the move started.
3024.32s:  So this is still when it was down grinding lower.
3029.76s:  It created this short term base at about 10.
3034.68s:  And then it was grinding a little bit higher, but it hasn't even made that breakout move
3038.48s:  yet to the upside.
3039.48s:  The initial leg up.
3041.32s:  It hasn't made that yet.
3043.00s:  And if you take a look at the options, there's 414,000 calls to 106,000 puts.
3052.68s:  So it's literally almost four times calls to puts.
3058.52s:  And this is before that move.
3059.72s:  This is why options are so informative.
3062.96s:  You can see a lot of information and options.
3065.80s:  It's how I caught this most recent move.
3067.68s:  It's how I traded the squeeze back in 2021 is through identifying stuff like this.
3075.64s:  So anyways, what I'm highlighting to you is before the move even started.
3079.60s:  And even if you include roaring kiddie's position in here, which was 120,000, right?
3086.16s:  Take those 120,000 out of this.
3089.20s:  It's still three times calls to puts.
3093.84s:  So massive, massive calls to you when this thing started wanting to make some pretty,
3100.04s:  pretty meaningful movements up.
3102.72s:  When I look at it now, right, there's a, there's much denser options, but there are also
3109.60s:  much more balanced.
3111.76s:  It's not even two to one at this point calls to puts.
3115.16s:  It's contracted quite a lot.
3117.56s:  So now looking out at the expiration cycle of choice, which is 16 aug.
3126.08s:  And the reason why I think it's important to look out at 16 aug because two aug is really
3129.72s:  quiet.
3130.72s:  Nine aug is even more quiet still.
3133.28s:  16 aug is the first chance we get a look at something that even offers something active.
3138.56s:  And I say this a lot to remind people because the monthly explorations are almost always
3145.04s:  going to be busier than the other explorations available to us.
3149.52s:  And it's specifically from a liquidity perspective.
3152.88s:  This is very, very common behavior.
3154.60s:  This is not anomalous in any stretch of the imagination.
3158.36s:  So I think it's just important to know that this is overall, I would consider it like
3165.28s:  generally standard fare, essentially.
3173.44s:  It has very lime, spin drift, big fan.
3176.84s:  I got to stop drinking on the onal Palmer because it's black tea.
3180.08s:  It's got caffeine and we're coming up on 6 p.m.
3182.64s:  We're not about to be, we're not about that life.
3185.92s:  So when I look at 16 aug, I see a few things.
3188.60s:  I see the very standard, massive, massive build out of options here at the 125.
3195.76s:  And I continue to see this every single cycle.
3198.92s:  This is actually something that I try and trade myself, not the 125s, but the mispricing
3203.52s:  of the 125s and the rush of volume.
3207.16s:  It's something that I can actually see happening and try to front run it a little bit.
3213.24s:  The other primary strikes that I see look like here, I'm going to guess these are the
3217.52s:  30s.
3218.52s:  Yep.
3219.52s:  These look like the 40s.
3221.52s:  Yep.
3222.52s:  These look like 25s.
3224.72s:  Yes, these look like 20s.
3227.36s:  Yes.
3228.80s:  These look like 50s.
3230.48s:  What I'm highlighting is that this is standard human behavior where we pick the round numbers.
3235.96s:  Right.
3236.96s:  So there's a 15 to 16 to 17 and 18 19, 20, 20.
3239.56s:  So yeah, I can count, believe it or not.
3241.48s:  I got to check.
3242.48s:  Do you see that?
3243.48s:  You see that shit counted right there?
3245.12s:  No problem.
3246.12s:  Can do it.
3247.12s:  And so when I look at this though, I can still see that that's where most people are really
3254.60s:  centralizing their options.
3256.80s:  My ham says 125 can't be retail.
3259.08s:  They did the mistake once, twice, three times.
3260.64s:  What else could it be?
3261.64s:  Oh no, I definitely think it's largely retail.
3264.72s:  Yeah.
3265.72s:  I wouldn't say that it's all retail.
3270.20s:  This is also a place for institutions to get cheap hedging, depending on what kind of
3275.68s:  trades they're putting on.
3278.00s:  But this is, yeah, I mean, it's pretty clear that like this is absolutely a mix of retail.
3285.16s:  The reason why it's so clear to me is because if you look at the transactions, so many of
3288.72s:  them are one lots.
3290.40s:  And again, like institutions, they're not going to use one lot.
3294.20s:  It's just so grossly inefficient for them to try to place those trades.
3300.16s:  So it just in order to build any sort of size that they would want.
3305.08s:  So yeah, I don't really think, yeah, I don't really think it's not retail.
3313.16s:  I think it's a mix of retail and institutions for sure.
3317.48s:  But I would 100% argue back that it can be retail.
3321.52s:  There's probably a lot of them in there actually is based on the purchasing behaviors that
3326.20s:  I see, which we can actually validate a little bit.
3330.00s:  All right, I got to minimize some of these screens.
3334.72s:  So realize I got like way too many windows open and I'm getting lost navigating between
3340.92s:  these windows.
3341.92s:  But didn't like that.
3343.96s:  So that we can turn off.
3346.36s:  This will take up close that.
3349.16s:  All right, we're looking better here.
3355.68s:  This we need this we don't need.
3360.04s:  And then this is the post I'm going to work through with you guys.
3362.96s:  All right, great, great, great, great.
3365.60s:  We're looking good.
3366.60s:  Here we go.
3368.60s:  All right, let's see.
3378.56s:  If we take a look and the reason I'm using this is because there's well, there's a couple
3383.52s:  other sources.
3384.52s:  I like using this one.
3385.52s:  I'm talking with you guys about it because I feel like it's easier for you guys to see
3388.72s:  based on this tool is compared to what I use.
3394.24s:  So yeah, dust to dust.
3396.40s:  What up?
3397.40s:  I appreciate the unbiased like a GME.
3399.24s:  That's awesome.
3400.24s:  I'm not going to lie.
3401.24s:  There was a couple of instances where I've been talking about this stuff that I was kind
3404.04s:  of concerned that like people might be upset to not hear always like just great stuff
3410.72s:  about what might be going on.
3413.60s:  But I've always really, I mean, that's like the platform that I started the YouTube channel
3417.60s:  on.
3418.60s:  Right?
3419.60s:  It's like the whole ideas finance with the bullshit.
3421.36s:  So my I say to everybody in a lot of the videos as well.
3424.60s:  My goal really is not to spread hype or fide.
3428.52s:  It's to try and present information for people to then synthesize on the room and figure
3434.64s:  out what they think of it and how it fits into their broader picture.
3439.32s:  I'm very, very personally invested into like the empowerment of individual traders.
3448.20s:  That's the basis behind it.
3451.72s:  It's because like I feel trade trading has changed my life.
3455.56s:  And I don't want to go into this whole fucking story of my background.
3458.56s:  But like unequivocally has changed my life.
3460.12s:  I grew up poor.
3461.76s:  And now because of trading, I'm at a completely different echelon in my life.
3466.08s:  I literally retired my mom because I figured out how to do this shit.
3470.68s:  And it's a really powerful skill set once it's understood.
3473.84s:  The problem is so many instances people start trading like myself with really terrible
3480.36s:  terrible understanding of what they're getting into and expectations.
3484.40s:  And then it leads to people just losing tons of money unnecessarily.
3487.84s:  So one of my big objectives there is to try to put stuff out to slow people down from
3493.68s:  doing that.
3494.68s:  Like that's there's a video that I have here and I'll I'll share it in here.
3499.28s:  Literally every single time I have an opportunity to share this video, I do.
3503.88s:  And the video is about buying call options smarter.
3509.96s:  And that's literally exactly what it's called.
3511.68s:  It's a 16 minute video about this exact thing.
3516.52s:  So that video goes into structuring trades at least what I would consider to be smarter.
3524.92s:  So that it's not necessarily just lighting money on fire continually.
3529.64s:  But anyways, back to this.
3531.72s:  So we're going to get rid of the bids.
3534.16s:  We're going to look at the 125s specifically so we can kill the puts.
3539.36s:  And then we need to look specifically for people that are gaining exposure in 18 or I'm
3547.68s:  sorry, 16 and then let's do strike price minimum 125, which is also the maximum.
3555.40s:  So we don't have to put into.
3558.44s:  So let's see.
3560.36s:  So for the past week, there's and again, this is limiting by size, right?
3565.38s:  This is not tracking all of the transactions.
3567.68s:  This is looking at the larger transactions.
3571.00s:  That's what these platforms do.
3572.16s:  I have another platform.
3573.68s:  Well, really, it's a data source opera that I can pull all of the data for if we wanted.
3579.92s:  But really, I just want to highlight the fact that a lot of these positions in general
3584.88s:  are being entered in much smaller size.
3588.00s:  Right?
3588.84s:  So like the total premium for this trade is a thousand bucks.
3590.80s:  This one right here.
3592.00s:  So it's just there's just not much size going on here.
3597.48s:  So more often than not, there's again, like this isn't probably an institution building
3603.04s:  some sort of position.
3604.04s:  They would have to do a lot of this.
3606.16s:  And you can look the way it's deconflicted by time.
3608.80s:  That's probably not the case.
3610.52s:  Like these look like smaller traders or it could be, you know, smaller institutions.
3614.32s:  It's not all institutions are huge.
3616.48s:  But still, the idea there that I'm just trying to highlight for you guys is that it absolutely
3621.88s:  looks like there's a mix of activity going on there.
3624.40s:  I think that's kind of the general synopsis on that.
3632.24s:  Let me see.
3633.24s:  I'd rather be seeing saying, I'd rather be skiing is saying, yep, I'm trying to learn
3637.00s:  proper options so I can stop doing straight equity all the time.
3639.68s:  Yeah.
3640.68s:  What I think about trading is options are a tool and they have their place.
3650.84s:  They're not inherently better than a bunch of other tools, but they do afford a lot of
3658.24s:  opportunities that are not afforded by things like equity.
3667.08s:  So that is a reality behind these products.
3671.68s:  And I absolutely think that that's something to be aware of for people because it's, they
3676.76s:  offer a lot of opportunity is what it boils down to.
3683.84s:  Adam says, don't understand why there's zero interest in two stocks that have almost
3687.52s:  perfect correlation.
3688.52s:  I didn't see your talk.
3690.12s:  I'm happy to take a look at whatever you want to take a look at.
3693.52s:  If there's another stock that you want to look at, I'm totally down.
3699.84s:  The I just wanted to be correlated in some degree to to GME because that, I mean, that's
3705.72s:  the whole point of this stream specifically.
3709.72s:  In the meantime, let's take a look.
3713.92s:  Costs in GME.
3715.92s:  Yeah.
3718.24s:  So what, what, like, what is the link you guys see?
3722.72s:  Maybe we can start there.
3724.72s:  So Adam, could you outline for me the way that you see, like the correlation?
3732.64s:  Because here's one of the things to be aware of.
3734.48s:  If you're looking at just the way that price performs.
3737.28s:  But yeah, I mean, let's just take a look.
3740.64s:  Let's just take a look together really quick because my guess is there will be a few things.
3745.96s:  Let's go to a parish trade.
3749.28s:  And then let's take a look at costs.
3751.72s:  And then let's take a look at GME.
3754.00s:  And then let's take a look at costs.
3756.72s:  And then let's take a look at GME.
3760.12s:  So they're not that correlated.
3768.16s:  Adam says their charts are the same.
3769.88s:  The charts are not the same.
3771.76s:  Again, this is one of the problems that I think people have in the community is they really
3776.64s:  seek super hard to overfit stuff that is just not, it's just not the same.
3784.92s:  So for example, GME on the 13th, it had this move on the 13th cost had this move.
3796.28s:  Like it's just, it's not the same.
3798.24s:  It costs move absolutely, but is it the same?
3801.52s:  Absolutely not.
3802.52s:  The other data point I would show to you that shows that it's not the same is if I look
3806.52s:  at three June, I see this move.
3810.20s:  And then if I look at three June, I see this move.
3813.60s:  So yeah, I just, I don't actually agree that they're the same because they're, they're
3820.88s:  really, really not.
3822.92s:  If I look at something like three July, I see this move.
3827.92s:  And then if I look at three July, I see this move.
3832.48s:  The other thing is looking at just the actual, again, like an objective analysis of the
3837.32s:  price behavior, take a look at the correlations and how sporadic they are.
3844.28s:  Three day correlation, 60% five day correlation, negative 5%, 10 day correlation, 53% 30 day
3851.68s:  correlation, 3% like this is not a product that's correlated, at least in terms of price
3857.08s:  behavior.
3858.08s:  Like again, this is one of the problems is like when you want to see something so bad,
3863.60s:  you can make yourself see it.
3865.44s:  But like as I look at this and try to identify that pattern you're seeing, it's just not
3873.72s:  here.
3874.72s:  Now I want to be again, also very clear.
3877.84s:  It doesn't mean that there's no, no overlap.
3880.92s:  Of course there's overlap.
3882.36s:  They operate in similar communities to one another.
3887.12s:  But beyond that, I just don't, I just don't see the broader correlation that you're seeing
3894.16s:  here.
3895.16s:  Yeah, even down from like a volume perspective, I don't see it.
3901.12s:  There's some overlap zero doubt 100% agree with that point.
3905.56s:  But they do not like going back to the original point.
3908.60s:  I think that this person made is that their charts are the same and like they are not the
3914.76s:  same.
3915.76s:  That is an objective fallacy.
3918.80s:  They are correlated in different instances in different degrees, but not the same.
3924.48s:  Rudabegas says why would two completely different stocks correlate?
3928.44s:  Well, a bunch of different reasons, like they're, they can be part of some of the same ETFs.
3934.28s:  They can be part of similar industries.
3938.16s:  So I don't know much about costs.
3941.08s:  So I mean, let's take a quick look and specifically just take a look at what industry and like
3947.36s:  what they do.
3951.24s:  Consumer discretionary for costs.
3954.32s:  So there's your first overlap just from a very high perspective.
3957.60s:  They're both in consumer discretionary, straight from the jump.
3961.52s:  So one of the questions Rudabegas, who's why would they correlate a bunch of different
3966.80s:  reasons, stocks can correlate if they're in similar industries, even if they're not
3972.04s:  having similar experiences.
3974.40s:  So you'll see this in the financial sectors all the time and you'll see this across the
3979.92s:  airlines all the time.
3981.68s:  You'll find things that operate in similar industries like this that move generally similarly
3989.40s:  to other things.
3991.50s:  So Max says, cost makes headphones and audio gear.
3995.82s:  They are not the same, but there are several instances where costs had jumps right before
3998.90s:  GME moved.
4000.38s:  Yeah, I could see why people will say that and I'm not saying it didn't happen.
4005.38s:  The reason why I have that exasperated response is because I think in issue, like again, like
4013.14s:  let's let's look at it.
4015.06s:  I wear in this chart over the last six months that cost moved before GME.
4021.50s:  I see some of the similar price movements on the same days, but I don't actually see
4027.38s:  where costs moved before GME.
4032.02s:  Kate, Kate Kresher says we're new today.
4034.54s:  Today was Newton's union break.
4036.74s:  He's off today, but he will be back with us next week.
4040.74s:  And then, yeah, because we definitely need the Oracle here with all the back of the
4044.74s:  scribe, I should say.
4048.50s:  The GME scribe that's got all this information down pat.
4053.30s:  But yeah, like I don't even see the reference there to be completely honest.
4058.62s:  I see like the third cost went up, but so did GME.
4065.54s:  I see costs went up ever so slightly here on the 23rd, but so did GME.
4073.50s:  So that's kind of the problem, right?
4076.78s:  Is again, like I think we attempt to pattern seek to a degree and over, over correlate
4084.42s:  mentally.
4085.42s:  I'd rather be skiing.
4086.42s:  Says I would say they're being manipulated be the same basket of ETF.
4089.42s:  So they move similarly with big action.
4091.54s:  But no, I'd rather be skiing.
4093.42s:  I think that makes a ton of sense.
4095.50s:  If I were to deduce what I think is going on in terms of the general correlation, I would
4101.38s:  see two things.
4102.38s:  I would see the first thing is they literally are in the same sector, right?
4106.46s:  They're both consumer discretionary.
4108.14s:  That in and of itself will lead them to behave slightly similarly.
4114.34s:  After that, they, if depending on how much overlap for those ETFs, I absolutely could
4122.58s:  see the redemption and creation cycle impacting this and the FTD cycle impacting this through
4129.30s:  the ETFs.
4130.54s:  So yeah, of course, I think that there's a lot of credence behind similarities here.
4138.18s:  It's just I don't, I wouldn't take the concept of similarities and extrapolate that out into
4143.14s:  saying they're the same or the charts are the same.
4146.38s:  Again, like they are not.
4149.34s:  And I can see that they are not with my eyeballs.
4151.94s:  So yeah, it's a, and it's a totally fair point.
4154.18s:  Like I said, I'm always down to look at whatever you guys want to look at or the ideas.
4158.42s:  But I think the, the ideas have to be somewhat well-founded.
4164.06s:  And this, again, I see correlation here, but I don't necessarily see the same degree of
4169.18s:  correlation that it looks like others might see.
4176.66s:  And I, harm says, can you check blackberry, no matter what happens with cyber security
4181.42s:  or text stocks, it doesn't move as all in this connected to Jimmy basket.
4186.02s:  I don't know shit about blackberry.
4188.82s:  So I don't have like a big, I forgot how many bees it needs.
4196.10s:  Yeah, I mean, I don't feel much about this.
4200.86s:  I also have to be honest with you guys.
4202.98s:  I essentially do not trade stuff that's below five bucks.
4206.70s:  Like I just don't care.
4208.74s:  It's from a liquidity perspective.
4210.78s:  Stuff that I consider, if it's under five bucks, I consider it a penny stock.
4214.46s:  It's too small.
4215.94s:  And they are very difficult to trade or make money.
4219.26s:  I know it's alluring to other people because they're cheap.
4223.38s:  And if you have a really small account, it might seem attractive, but they're probably
4226.50s:  not as attractive as people might think they are, in my opinion.
4229.98s:  So I don't have a giant opinion here.
4235.82s:  Ukraine says, what about AMC and Jimmy?
4237.94s:  Lots of people say they're on the same algo.
4240.62s:  That's another tricky one.
4242.54s:  So first, let's dissect this idea of the same algo, quote unquote.
4246.58s:  And I don't think that that's accurate because that's not even how the algorithms for
4252.34s:  high frequency traders in high frequency trading firms work.
4256.98s:  Would they be looked at and traded against one another in different baskets and stuff
4261.28s:  by different algorithms?
4262.60s:  Of course, absolutely.
4263.60s:  And I would expect them to be.
4267.06s:  But like again, if I look across this over the last six months and I compare this to the
4272.58s:  GME chart for the past six months, they're different.
4277.82s:  They are different things.
4279.54s:  That's what I see.
4281.26s:  Does that mean that they have no overlap or no correlation?
4284.86s:  Of course not.
4285.86s:  They still seem to have that.
4289.54s:  But it's they're different.
4291.46s:  And like I can see that they're different.
4294.98s:  Running DGen says talks about meltup happening in GME next week.
4300.50s:  I mean, what's the avid?
4302.50s:  Again, I think that's one of the problems that plagues the community is that people just
4306.78s:  say stuff.
4307.78s:  And maybe this person has great due diligence.
4310.70s:  I just haven't seen it.
4312.10s:  So first, from your perspective, running DGen, what's the theory?
4316.70s:  What's the thesis behind it?
4318.38s:  And why what makes you believe that?
4321.78s:  Because I don't necessarily, like from what you say there, it essentially doesn't mean
4327.50s:  anything to me.
4329.54s:  If you have a post about anything that they've talked about or like their ideas, happy
4337.86s:  to look at it.
4339.06s:  But based on that comment alone, I can't really do anything with it because it doesn't have
4343.22s:  any data for me to look at.
4346.18s:  Speaking of DD though, this one's interesting.
4349.54s:  So this one got sent over to me.
4352.50s:  And I think this one is interesting because it apparently looks to speculate on the relationship
4358.34s:  between GME and Chewie, which you can help find it interesting, right?
4365.02s:  Because there is a reality here where Rory and Kitty, who to be very clear, is not a cat
4373.78s:  as indicated by this tick box here, very important for everybody to understand not a cat, has
4380.34s:  9 million or access to 9 million 1000 shares.
4384.66s:  So that's actually one of the first things we need to analyze here is when filing a 13
4391.86s:  D, do options count.
4400.30s:  And then as always, I prefer to go to the horse's mouth.
4406.90s:  Should shares that an issue were repurchased to fund a stock option plan, the outstanding,
4413.46s:  so that's no.
4419.06s:  Then a 13 D or G sells a security short does the beneficial ownership change.
4429.58s:  The same analysis applies to the pledge of an or the writing of call options.
4438.86s:  So what I want to what I'm trying to like, discreetly identify because I thought the
4443.26s:  answer was yes, but I want to actually get to the bottom of it is do options?
4449.10s:  Are they part of this?
4454.94s:  Both says checkout James Rowland.
4458.06s:  But if, Bo, if you have something from James that we should look at, put it in here.
4463.26s:  I don't, I don't go chasing like individual ideas because there's so many of them.
4469.38s:  But if you guys have access or if you guys have come across some that again, like look
4474.98s:  like they have good due diligence, let's take a look at it.
4477.34s:  Like that's the whole point of these sessions.
4479.42s:  But if the due diligence is, you know, quote unquote, the melt up with a rocket ship,
4483.06s:  that's, that's not due diligence to me.
4484.70s:  That's just a hope, which I do hope that it works out for whoever wants that to happen.
4490.10s:  But that's personally not what I go off of or anything that I would consider to be like
4496.06s:  efficacious or like usable information for me.
4501.34s:  But back to this, I really am curious because so let me take a step back and let me explain
4506.22s:  to you why I care about this.
4508.86s:  So the reason why this matters is because if you can do this with options, you do not need
4517.06s:  anywhere near the same amount of money that you need if it is not options.
4523.10s:  So for example, it looks like the purchase happened on June 24.
4526.98s:  So if we go to Chewy and we look at 24 June, which lines up, right, there's a ton of
4535.66s:  buy volume.
4537.50s:  And let's say on 24 June, let's give them even an advantageous price.
4541.90s:  Let's say it's like towards the bottom.
4543.42s:  Let's say it gets in at like 25.5.
4545.42s:  These other trades do tend to seem to be like towards the morning.
4549.30s:  So I imagine it would be close.
4550.74s:  So let's call it like 2529 or 2538, 25.3.
4555.98s:  I literally just typed in 25.6 as I said, 25.3 because I'm an idiot.
4560.98s:  So 9 million 1000 shares.
4564.74s:  He needs 227 million, 725,300.
4569.66s:  So what I'm going to do is drop that in the chat here so I keep track of that number.
4575.26s:  So 227, 725, 300 or shares at 25.3.
4586.94s:  So that's the position as reported here at least.
4592.42s:  Now if this was done via options, there's actually a very different position that can be put
4600.62s:  on.
4601.62s:  So again, let's go back in time.
4602.86s:  Let's literally look at this on that day.
4605.02s:  Let's go to 24 June in Chewie and we'll go back in time.
4610.38s:  Welcome to the time machine.
4611.78s:  June 24 Monday.
4615.38s:  Let's see.
4618.90s:  So what I can tell you is that it didn't happen very first thing on the open at least as
4625.78s:  of yet because I do not see any meaningful volume coming in.
4630.74s:  Although it is starting to drift up indicating to me some level of some level of buying and
4642.22s:  then just so you know right now it's pre-buffering.
4644.22s:  That's why we're just chilling.
4648.78s:  James says, oh, that's funny.
4650.82s:  James Barrett says James Rowland is saying stuff about weekly and monthly triggers.
4654.86s:  I don't know what that means, but it would be interested.
4657.06s:  Yeah.
4658.14s:  Again, if you guys literally just throw in the chat, whatever I'm supposed to look at
4662.18s:  and I'm happy to take a look at it.
4665.50s:  Uh oh.
4666.50s:  So apparently, apparently the feds, the feds is watching.
4672.90s:  We try to go back in time.
4673.90s:  We try to look at this and it disconnected.
4677.02s:  Now it's reconnecting.
4678.50s:  Max says he would have have bought on the 13th through the 24th to fill in for options
4685.70s:  to fill in the 13G.
4687.46s:  Yeah, exactly.
4688.06s:  I agree with you.
4689.34s:  Yeah.
4690.34s:  If it was options until he accumulated whatever total position it would have been because
4696.06s:  the, but this lists the date of the event.
4699.22s:  So I know what you're doing there.
4700.38s:  I think that that makes sense.
4704.22s:  Yo, what is going on?
4709.06s:  This thing is like fully locked up.
4710.90s:  This is nuts.
4712.42s:  Let me try changing the time.
4713.70s:  We'll do like 0732.
4717.18s:  This is crazy.
4723.70s:  Maxion says I just watched the James video and he just draws random lines on the video
4729.90s:  and it's from 13 days ago.
4731.22s:  Yeah.
4733.70s:  And again, maybe there's more due diligence behind it, but.
4740.46s:  Yeah, I mean, if it amounts to that, it doesn't really mean that much to me.
4745.10s:  Rhino duck.
4746.10s:  I advise RK to come back YouTube weekly or perhaps we're a suit.
4757.02s:  That's funny.
4758.34s:  Let me see.
4759.34s:  I'm just curious if I can get this to work.
4763.90s:  Like I'm actually kind of fascinated right now.
4766.22s:  If not, we can use current options.
4774.10s:  It's not a big deal.
4774.86s:  It just won't be quite as accurate as I would like it to be.
4780.10s:  What's happening here?
4782.22s:  Let me try another ticker.
4783.30s:  Let's try like Apple.
4790.42s:  We'll let that run for a second.
4792.10s:  Anyways, back to this in the general hypothesis.
4795.74s:  The reason why I care about this is because if you can use options when filling in a 13G,
4801.78s:  so does a 13G apply to options.
4806.86s:  The reason why this matters is because if you can use options, you can put this position
4812.54s:  on much more cheaply than before.
4817.46s:  So this says yes.
4821.70s:  This is from this, whatever this is.
4827.38s:  This says 13G of Securities Act 1934 applies to cash settled options that use, okay, so
4835.46s:  that's actually helpful because this says cash settled options, which is not these.
4842.26s:  This includes derivatives that are not offered sold, originated with the issuer.
4850.70s:  It's a 6 to form to include the description, so it would have to be in here.
4854.10s:  It would have to be in item 6, where's item 6?
4857.26s:  This is the same exactly right.
4861.26s:  But yeah, anyways, this looks like, this looks like shares to me based on that, based
4868.78s:  on that quick cursory overview.
4871.70s:  The reason why that matters is because in order for that to have happened, again, going
4875.78s:  back to that comment, I left up above for a reference, he needs $227,725,300.
4882.90s:  What we do know is that he doesn't have that much money in the account as of 13 June,
4889.34s:  meaning to be able to do both positions at once.
4895.34s:  Now there's some people speculating, and Newton and I, we went through an exercise, this
4900.22s:  is just not working up here.
4902.22s:  We went through an exercise where we analyzed, one of his ideas was, could he have traded
4910.58s:  enough options with the residual cash here, the 6.3 million, to essentially get another
4916.78s:  $200 million in the time frame from this update, which was the 13th of June until the trade
4924.82s:  was reported in July.
4927.94s:  And again, I'm very against speaking definitively about things that may or may not be true, but
4934.14s:  what I can say is the probability that he turned that $6 million into the requisite $227
4941.06s:  million while completely maintaining this GME position is obscenely low.
4946.22s:  Just wildly low.
4948.98s:  Is it impossible?
4950.06s:  No, not impossible.
4952.26s:  But is it probable?
4953.86s:  Nope, not probable at all.
4956.38s:  So then it leads to the question of, does he have other accounts with other money?
4960.58s:  Could be, again, the only thing I can say about that that I'm unsure of is in his live
4967.58s:  stream that he did, which I'll grab real quick, he explicitly said that he doesn't, and
4974.22s:  I kind of just believe him.
4978.14s:  Here.
4982.14s:  This is...
4983.14s:  Nope, wrong one.
4989.14s:  Wait.
4993.78s:  I'm confused.
4998.06s:  Oh, okay, there it is.
5000.06s:  What's he gonna say?
5001.06s:  Is it gone?
5002.46s:  Here we go.
5005.30s:  This.
5010.30s:  So let's listen to this real quick, because I think he's about to pull his account up,
5013.74s:  yeah.
5014.74s:  It hurts.
5015.74s:  It hurts doing my best here.
5017.74s:  I'm trying to learn him to do it.
5018.74s:  But it like it's like a check.
5020.74s:  Oh, all right, it's unhaulsed.
5023.22s:  All right, I'm gonna do it.
5025.58s:  I'm gonna do it.
5026.58s:  Don't try to do it.
5027.58s:  All right, let me bring it over here.
5029.50s:  I think it's fine if I bring this over.
5031.30s:  Let me check.
5032.30s:  Let me refresh.
5033.30s:  Oh, we got it.
5034.30s:  All right, I'm gonna bring it over.
5036.10s:  Don't hold it.
5037.10s:  Don't hold it.
5038.10s:  There you go.
5039.10s:  Is it on the chat there?
5041.66s:  There you go.
5042.66s:  All right.
5043.66s:  Cheers.
5044.66s:  Cheers.
5045.66s:  So those, yeah, those are my only positions.
5049.78s:  You know, as you know about me, I'll take a, it's a true yellow again, I suppose.
5057.34s:  I know there's some cash there.
5059.18s:  That's what I mean.
5060.18s:  It depends on your positions, but that's it.
5063.14s:  So that's it, right?
5064.14s:  So he says those are my only positions.
5066.66s:  He said, I know there's some cash there.
5068.22s:  It depends on your position, right?
5069.98s:  Because he makes the comment of is cash a position, which makes total sense.
5074.38s:  Because some people genuinely, and that's why he makes that reference, is because some
5078.62s:  people, they legitimately do consider cash a position.
5082.86s:  So that's why he's making that comment.
5084.70s:  It's another yellow again.
5086.46s:  You know what I'm saying?
5087.46s:  It's how I roll.
5088.46s:  So that's out there.
5089.46s:  But I see those headlines.
5092.94s:  I see those headlines.
5097.26s:  I got to check, I'm checking in every day.
5099.06s:  A long enough, like, I'm right position still.
5101.06s:  Actually, I wasn't even paying attention to the details.
5103.62s:  They're still there.
5104.62s:  But I'm each morning, I'm like, I don't know what's happening.
5107.26s:  So I go, all right, well, don't make this.
5109.30s:  Just burn the thing.
5110.30s:  Headlines being too worthy guy wakes up, but he's waking up.
5114.66s:  They're going down.
5115.66s:  Oh, is it halted again?
5116.66s:  Because if, if it's halted, it doesn't.
5119.66s:  Yeah, there you go.
5120.98s:  There you go.
5122.98s:  It's going down in general, educational advice here in general, not specific to.
5128.02s:  So yeah, anyways, that I think that's informative, right?
5131.62s:  So then it goes back to the idea of begging the question of where does that $227 million
5137.78s:  come from.
5139.54s:  So I don't know.
5143.22s:  I really don't know.
5144.58s:  The simplest answer in my opinion aligns actually with what this, I think this person is
5150.54s:  talking about, we have to go through this really quick because somebody was talking about
5154.10s:  this post they sent it to me and I wanted to look through.
5156.66s:  So this is from Green Guard.
5160.54s:  You guys see this person's name?
5168.94s:  This is crazy.
5169.94s:  This is crazy.
5173.94s:  The person's name is Green Carly Catling.
5177.38s:  Oh, that's so awesome.
5179.94s:  The matchin says he has a fidelity tab.
5182.62s:  It's possible that he has a lot of cash sitting in that account, but it's just pure speculation.
5186.50s:  Yeah, and I think it's okay to guess, right?
5190.54s:  But the way I look at it at least is I just go off of what he's saying.
5197.78s:  And could there be something else?
5201.22s:  Sure.
5202.22s:  Actually, let's see.
5203.82s:  Yeah, so I see because here's my guess with fidelity.
5209.34s:  My guess is that his prior employment is through there.
5213.74s:  My guess is that's like a retirement account because he used to work at a financial institution
5218.22s:  and I'm sure that he probably got a 401k through them.
5222.06s:  So my guess is that's probably a retirement account.
5225.10s:  If I had to guess, that's a pretty standard provider for those, especially for financial
5234.34s:  companies and stuff.
5235.90s:  So yeah.
5237.90s:  Anyways, again, a matchin to your point, you could be completely cracked.
5242.18s:  There could be another account and he goes in there and checks it out or it could be
5245.18s:  a bunch of cash could be absolutely could be.
5247.86s:  It also, again, in my opinion, could be just a retirement account.
5251.26s:  That's my guess.
5252.54s:  But we have no idea.
5253.54s:  Could be either or.
5257.14s:  Banana says retirement account.
5261.58s:  LOL, but yeah, could be.
5263.18s:  Yeah, my guess is probably a, if you work at an employer that offers a 401k, they have
5271.90s:  specific people they offer them through.
5273.66s:  You don't get to pick.
5274.66s:  I have, I don't know if it's on, it's not on here because I use their fidelity, but
5279.46s:  I have a 401k through there when I worked at Deloitte.
5283.50s:  So yeah, it's really, really common for those kinds of things, at least in my opinion.
5293.10s:  It could be provided by somebody like Fidelity.
5296.58s:  So yeah, it's, it's completely possible.
5299.58s:  Anyways, now that I got over this really, really fun, this really fun thing, let's take
5305.42s:  a look.
5308.18s:  So they're trying to solve the puzzle.
5313.42s:  I'm just trying to get to the part where they start talking about stuff.
5318.34s:  Jacob Walter says, how would you play an event like six three if you had calls going
5322.42s:  into it?
5323.34s:  I assume you're talking about in GameStop.
5330.46s:  Like this event.
5335.34s:  And Jacob, give me more context.
5337.90s:  Are you talking about like on the day of the event into the event?
5341.14s:  Do we know about the event or not?
5342.90s:  You have to give me way more information.
5346.18s:  So following that it's this, following that where we have calls of some sort going into
5352.98s:  it and we didn't know it was going to happen.
5359.54s:  But then that leads to a couple of follow on questions of like what's the position?
5366.06s:  What's the point of the original position?
5368.30s:  What's the objective for it?
5369.30s:  That kind of stuff.
5370.30s:  Because I mean, for me, if you had calls leading into this, you made money, right?
5374.90s:  Like it started up.
5376.78s:  So for me, I'll tell you guys right now, like I played this move.
5381.06s:  I played not this move, but this end into this.
5385.22s:  And then I played from this down to this.
5388.02s:  I played from this down.
5392.38s:  I played this up.
5395.66s:  I played this down.
5397.54s:  I actually got stopped out on this one.
5400.18s:  And then this is for like options plays.
5402.78s:  I've had long shares in GameStop for a while now.
5407.54s:  I just kind of hold them.
5409.58s:  But the options plays are completely different.
5412.50s:  Like the options plays are really designed to take advantage of momentum and movement.
5416.22s:  So every time that I see these larger moves, I'm playing them.
5420.06s:  Now for something like this, if I had long calls, I'd like just figure out where the profit
5424.82s:  point is and take the damn profit.
5427.22s:  But that kind of stuff has to be decided before you enter.
5430.46s:  And then what I like to use are a series of different stop orders to phase me out of
5437.26s:  a position to give it time in case there's some sort of intraday reversal because those
5441.94s:  happen.
5443.18s:  So I think, yeah, I mean, that's the general idea is I'm trying to capture the most movement
5451.14s:  that I can.
5452.94s:  And specifically with options, the movement that's one of the cool parts about options is
5457.14s:  I get to trade movement to two different directions up and down and sideways.
5462.46s:  So like right now, the positions I'm using are I have long shares.
5466.94s:  I don't have any long options anymore.
5468.34s:  I'm completely out of them.
5469.98s:  But I have short options against some of my shares, meaning sold calls against some of
5475.86s:  the shares.
5477.14s:  And it's literally to just make it easier to hold those shares as the underlying is trending
5482.90s:  sideways.
5484.06s:  But I already started phasing out of my long share position as well.
5487.02s:  I paired it down quite a lot because of these two moves.
5492.02s:  And then this is also where I exited essentially all of the remaining long options that I had.
5497.06s:  And it's just because options are a decaying asset.
5500.50s:  And the I know that a lot of folks in the eight community, they, you know, want to hold
5506.30s:  and just kind of diamond hand it.
5508.54s:  But if you do that with something like options, you will be holding dust because they go
5515.78s:  away.
5516.98s:  You can't just hold them.
5518.46s:  Otherwise you will be holding nothing.
5522.06s:  Black Swan says, what made you exit the set call position?
5525.74s:  The stock wasn't accommodating.
5527.46s:  Yeah.
5528.46s:  I mean, that's really what it boils down to.
5530.34s:  That position was put on to attempt to capitalize on an upward price movement.
5536.06s:  There was not a corresponding upward price movement.
5539.02s:  So again, for me, the calculus literally is quite that simple, right?
5543.34s:  Like if I'm trading long calls, I want something to go up.
5546.10s:  If it's not going up, I don't have the right position on.
5551.58s:  That's essentially the basis.
5555.02s:  Jacob says, if you know it's going to dump at market open, would you risk selling at
5560.18s:  open when it's volatile?
5561.50s:  Sure.
5562.50s:  But if you have long calls selling when it's volatile is good anyways.
5565.82s:  That expansion and volatility helps the long calls.
5569.98s:  If you have long calls and volatility starts to decay out, your long calls will decline
5577.18s:  in premium as will all other options as volatility starts to bleed out.
5582.66s:  So the problem you'll have in that instance is depending on the expiration of the long
5586.22s:  calls is how illiquid they are.
5588.46s:  That's one of the reasons why I took my options positions that I'm buying to the upside.
5592.38s:  My long calls further out in time because one of the problems you're going to have, and
5596.82s:  we went through an example of this before and if on-demand works, I'd love to show you
5600.46s:  again, because it's a good message to share with you guys.
5604.42s:  Because one of the issues that you'll have is if there is a big accommodating move, even
5610.34s:  if it's in your favor, liquidity is going to widen out in something like GameStop massively.
5615.58s:  So then it's really difficult to get out of your options at a fair price.
5620.26s:  It's actually kind of a giant problem.
5623.74s:  So that's also why I use a mix of options and shares because I don't want to get stuck
5631.66s:  if liquidity dries up too much and I can't get a decent fill.
5636.02s:  That would be really annoying if you get a good price moving your favor, but then the
5640.50s:  markets don't accommodate moving through it.
5643.38s:  This doesn't look like it's going to work for us.
5645.22s:  Sorry, Gang.
5647.58s:  Hey, hey, hey, hey, there we go.
5651.94s:  It worked.
5652.94s:  Beautiful.
5653.94s:  So, yeah, let's take a look at an example.
5656.18s:  Oh, this makes me super excited.
5657.94s:  The chart doesn't work, but who cares?
5659.34s:  We don't really need the chart.
5661.02s:  I do need to go back and pick a day though.
5664.06s:  So let's pick one May and then let's pick, I guess we could do the 14th.
5674.62s:  That doesn't even have to be the 14th, but we could use the 14th, 14th May.
5679.34s:  Now let's take a look at a quick example together.
5682.34s:  So if I go to 1 May, 1 May, let me go to the options.
5693.30s:  If this works, that would be absolutely fantastic.
5695.54s:  That would be a giant fan.
5705.62s:  And there we go.
5708.34s:  Cool.
5709.34s:  This is great.
5710.34s:  So now let's pick something like, let's take a look at this 17 May and let's pretend
5717.82s:  that we want to buy this at the money.
5720.66s:  So let's analyze this trade and then let's take a look at the risk profile here.
5726.86s:  So this will take a look at all the different positions that we want to compare.
5731.18s:  So that's that.
5732.70s:  Now let's take a look at and I'm building just different kinds of positions.
5737.90s:  So in the 17 May expiration, I'm using a mix of at the money in the money out of the
5746.66s:  money, that kind of stuff.
5749.58s:  And then let's take a look at something closer to what I would put on, which would be
5758.46s:  something like this.
5761.46s:  Yeah, something like that.
5767.30s:  All right.
5768.30s:  Now let's fast forward to 14 May.
5771.26s:  What I want to do is show you what the liquidity looks like on these different contracts.
5778.18s:  Right now you can see that there, you know, maybe 30 cents wide, 32 cents wide, something
5782.74s:  like that for these tens, right?
5785.26s:  So just remember the, let me get out of your way.
5787.94s:  The bin asked spread there.
5789.94s:  I think my, I got an alert from, oh, perfect.
5803.10s:  My door dashes on the way.
5805.58s:  So now take a look at the width here.
5807.66s:  Let me get out of the way.
5809.62s:  On those further out of the monies, we would have got them at a pretty good price.
5816.30s:  But still, if you take a look at the width of these, they were like 32 cents wide.
5821.54s:  Now they're like $1.45, massive, massive, massive expansion in the bid asked spread.
5832.66s:  These have become way less liquid.
5836.18s:  So even though the position would make a lot of money because of the overall appreciation
5839.98s:  which is fantastic, it still has that problem in front of it.
5843.86s:  Where when you're getting out, you're still going to essentially give a pound of flesh
5848.74s:  in order to get out, which is annoying.
5852.22s:  So yeah, anyways, that's the overall background behind that.
5855.34s:  I want to make sure that if that point makes sense to you guys.
5858.06s:  The idea that as things become more volatile, the premium of options will increase, but
5864.02s:  the liquidity of options will also widen out to a degree.
5868.58s:  It leads to a bit of a problem.
5871.90s:  Because if you're trading options and stuff like this, you have to be aware of that.
5875.26s:  Otherwise, you're going to find yourself in a really terrible scenario even if something
5879.22s:  starts working out in your favor.
5882.54s:  All right, so now back to this.
5886.38s:  So this person says they're good at logical conclusions, which is great.
5892.30s:  And this.
5893.30s:  Okay, so it talks about the 13G in Chewie.
5899.58s:  And he's guessing that by doing, by taking 6.6% that interesting.
5912.38s:  Oh, yeah, sorry, I missed a question in here.
5918.38s:  Nathan says, what are your thoughts on our case final beer emoji given the fact that
5923.06s:  international beer days?
5926.54s:  I have no idea how to interpret those emojis.
5928.70s:  I have to be honest with you, I'm not weighing them very heavily myself.
5932.50s:  And it's just because they're so obscure.
5936.94s:  And yeah, I think I don't think that much of them in terms of direct connections.
5947.62s:  I just think it's too obscure.
5950.14s:  And the other thing is remember, well, first, you guys tell me, I don't remember.
5955.34s:  When did he put that those stream of emojis out?
5959.34s:  When did that happen?
5963.70s:  Do you guys know?
5964.70s:  You guys probably know better than me.
5968.14s:  Afonso says I checked there's no fidelity tab on his live stream.
5971.06s:  It's a bookmark.
5972.54s:  You would see him fidelity on his regular source of it.
5974.54s:  Yeah, exactly.
5975.54s:  When, yeah, oh, I see you're correct in somebody else calling it a tab.
5978.74s:  Yeah, I just inferred bookmark when I saw it.
5981.74s:  But I see what you mean.
5984.74s:  But yeah, like when did when did he make that thing with all the emojis?
5991.94s:  Do you guys know?
5993.94s:  Damn it.
5996.94s:  You guys are making me look it up.
5998.82s:  Our Roryne Kitty emoji timeline video.
6006.10s:  Was it a video that he made?
6013.86s:  Here we go.
6014.86s:  At the end on May 15th.
6017.86s:  Yeah, so it was May 15th is when this came out here.
6030.58s:  So 15 May he made this.
6036.34s:  The problem in my opinion is well, a few things like the dog here.
6046.04s:  Would I have guessed that he was projecting out in time from the 15th of May that on
6055.54s:  the 20 what was it the 24th?
6059.18s:  Is that right?
6060.74s:  Let me see.
6062.74s:  We don't need this anymore.
6065.74s:  This June 24.
6069.70s:  So do I think that this here is him flagging on the 15th of May that on the 24th of June
6077.18s:  that he's going to buy chewy?
6079.38s:  I personally don't see that.
6082.06s:  Personally.
6084.74s:  And the reason being is because I and he could have done that.
6092.70s:  I want to be very clear like this is just my guess.
6095.98s:  He could have done that.
6097.14s:  But my guess is against that specifically because he's he can't know what Chewy's going
6105.54s:  to look like on that day at that point.
6109.30s:  And there's a really, really good chance that if things didn't look right for some reason
6115.18s:  or if new information was injected into this series before it happened, that that probably
6122.26s:  wouldn't have happened.
6123.82s:  Right.
6124.82s:  So I think yeah, to me, I just think that he might be trolling a little bit grabbing
6133.38s:  this from a Missy Elliott song, which is hilarious.
6137.18s:  And I think he also knows that people really, really look into things.
6142.10s:  And my guess is he probably has some fun with that.
6144.98s:  So if we take a look, I want to show you guys this interview really quick with Ryan Cohen.
6151.94s:  And there was a really funny part in this interview that I saw.
6160.82s:  I think it was maybe a podcast.
6163.62s:  This year.
6170.62s:  So I'm going to you guys should be able to hear the volume and stuff, but there's there's
6175.30s:  one in particular we need to look at.
6177.86s:  For go for it.
6184.86s:  All right.
6188.86s:  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
6196.94s:  Good shorts.
6198.26s:  This one.
6199.86s:  And while this is playing, I'm actually going to grab my dog real quick.
6203.42s:  So you guys should be able to hear this and I'll be back in two seconds.
6207.46s:  Okay, you can't hear that because I can't hear it.
6209.46s:  Why can't I hear that?
6213.46s:  And it's okay.
6214.46s:  You got the self affair.
6215.46s:  All right, Virginia.
6217.06s:  It's a photo of you in a game stop store.
6220.66s:  May 12, 2021.
6222.66s:  I think that's pretty self explanatory.
6224.86s:  I think there was an article that came out that claimed you were ghost shopping.
6227.66s:  Is that what you do?
6229.66s:  I mean, I'm always kind of, you know, when I go into the stores, goes shopping,
6234.16s:  checking out the place, seeing what the inventory.
6237.56s:  And you don't get recognized.
6239.16s:  Yeah.
6240.16s:  Yeah, more recently, I have a harder to do.
6242.16s:  Okay.
6243.16s:  Okay.
6244.16s:  Now, when I wrote about this on our website, I noted what was in your hand.
6248.36s:  And we spent a lot of time trying to figure out we thought it was a scooter,
6251.96s:  an electric scooter.
6252.96s:  Yes, it was not an electric scooter though, but it was a scooter.
6257.16s:  Just a non electric scooter.
6259.36s:  Do you do that a lot?
6260.36s:  Do you ride a normal scooter around?
6262.36s:  No, it wasn't mine actually was my son.
6264.96s:  All right.
6265.96s:  That's fair.
6266.96s:  So we got that one right?
6267.96s:  These kind of things we look at every detail matters.
6271.96s:  Yeah.
6272.96s:  Of course, people were looking at the way the games were set up.
6274.96s:  This part right here thought maybe there was a message there.
6277.76s:  So you hear that and then listen literally perfect timing.
6280.76s:  Listen to his response.
6282.96s:  Yeah.
6283.96s:  There wasn't one right.
6285.76s:  No message in the games.
6286.96s:  I didn't.
6287.96s:  I mean,
6288.96s:  No, there wasn't no.
6290.76s:  Wall Street.
6291.76s:  That right there and also so that you guys have a chance to see the.
6294.76s:  This is the GMM master.
6296.16s:  Wow, I need to get a haircut.
6297.76s:  My hair is way too long.
6298.96s:  Don't like that.
6300.76s:  So anyways, this is Thor.
6301.96s:  He wanted to come by say hello, shows some love for GameStop.
6306.16s:  He is right now is this like little feed up.
6309.76s:  A little tiny, a little baby feed.
6312.76s:  He's a little baby.
6314.16s:  But anyways, what I want to highlight from this video in particular.
6319.66s:  Is the fact that you know the interviewer went so far as to say like,
6325.06s:  Oh, you know, people are.
6329.66s:  Like people are guessing that there is some hitting meaning behind the arrangement of the games.
6336.46s:  And.
6338.46s:  He obviously jokes.
6339.66s:  He's like, no, there's no meaning, right?
6341.86s:  So the reason why I think that's a really important part for people to see is that it just shows.
6348.66s:  This idea of like pattern seeking and we want to look for all this meaning and all these different things.
6355.06s:  And sometimes when you have like a collective intellect looking for those things all at the same time with all of their combined resources, they can find a lot of shit.
6365.06s:  I had somebody sending me literally like binary code about the color scheme that roaring kitty used in the chewy post that he put up.
6375.56s:  And then he turned that.
6378.46s:  He had turned the binary code.
6380.46s:  It was into another language.
6383.06s:  And the like I don't it was an old language.
6386.06s:  I don't want to say it was like Sanskrit, but it was something like that.
6390.06s:  And there was a semi intelligible message in there.
6393.76s:  And this person had thought that roaring kitty changed the color of chewy.
6399.56s:  The using a specific color coding scheme that then translated into a binary code that one translated into Sanskrit.
6409.06s:  Had a message.
6411.56s:  Right.
6412.56s:  Probability of that is is pretty low.
6419.06s:  As I continue to always say it's not zero and there are hidden meanings in things that he does because also to the other side of this equation is there is a reality behind how roaring kitty communicates.
6436.96s:  And he does use memes right.
6440.96s:  He makes subtle changes to these different memes.
6445.96s:  And this is exactly how he does right.
6448.96s:  So like I can see why people do that because he makes these memes with game stop there the little kitty in the pocket that right like.
6457.46s:  So I totally get it.
6458.96s:  I totally get why people read into this stuff because it's meant to be read into a degree.
6464.46s:  But the problem again is that when your brain is primed to do that, then it can go overboard, especially when there are a lot of people.
6474.46s:  Again, like the combined intellect is so so much smarter than any individual Joe, Fana, sell who did that interview is now game stop social media head.
6487.46s:  That's awesome.
6488.46s:  That's I love that.
6490.46s:  Big big fan.
6492.46s:  So yeah, anyways, that's part of what I see there.
6496.46s:  And I think this is a good reminder of sometimes that there it's just it's just not meant to be you know necessarily something that in depth in that the games weren't associated in a specific manner.
6511.46s:  You know, nothing like that.
6514.46s:  So yeah, back to the emojis thing, I just I have a hard time seeing it personally.
6519.46s:  That's not like of course a bunch of this stuff could line up with different things that that's the nature of something like emojis is that they're so simple and open ended that you can look at these things in a million different ways.
6533.46s:  So it makes them highly applicable.
6536.46s:  It's like the same thing that you'll find with a lot of bullshit internet stock gurus who they'll say shit like blah blah blah blah.
6544.46s:  Could be support or could be resistance.
6548.46s:  Well, so well, no shit Sherlock like price can move. Thank you for that revelation.
6554.46s:  But the point being is it's just it's just a broad statement so that if something happens even closely aligned to what that person said then they get to say like oh well, it means this which that's probably not what they meant at the point of saying it.
6574.46s:  So the lag says but the Larry Chang aspect is a direct vision for the future of the company that's all I need. Yeah, I agree. I think Larry Chang from what I've read is he seems like a really cool dude.
6584.46s:  I'd love to talk to him and just learn a little bit more about how he views all this stuff because it's very interesting to me.
6591.46s:  Now let's keep going with this.
6594.46s:  The idea here is that he's trying to reenact 2021 and why would he use chewy over game stop.
6604.46s:  It talks about it being heavily shorted that the buyback pulled away liquidity and enormous buy and triggered a VWOP order to settle the trade.
6618.46s:  This I need to learn more about the way that you guys think about VWOP orders because it's it looks like the way you guys might think about them.
6630.46s:  Might differ a bit from the way I would think about it.
6635.46s:  But anyways, the biggest holding of XRT shorted 300% yep that makes sense Sanworm is approaching.
6643.46s:  There is no way this trade settled okay okay so far this looks reasonable to me.
6652.46s:  DFE sold 225 million worth of game stop.
6657.46s:  To buy chewy.
6661.46s:  Yeah, I think I mean I think that that makes sense.
6668.46s:  I probably would assume the same thing there I think that's okay.
6674.46s:  Oh, I get why that's such a big deal this makes sense.
6680.46s:  Stories of opacity says Richard said his favorite thing is a VWOP order.
6687.46s:  Yeah, no so to be clear like I know what they are I'm just trying to understand the way that you guys think about it in terms of like why that would be so impactful here a VWOP order why not a different kind of order why not any other order type why specifically a VWOP order.
6704.46s:  But the reason why I asked that question is I'm gaining context about how the community in this in this context interpolates the the tool itself because again like there's a million other order types that could occur here.
6720.46s:  So I'm trying to understand that emphasis specifically on a VWOP order from like a standard practitioner standpoint I totally understand why like for somebody like Newton I could see why he would like a VWOP order because it's essentially putting you in where a lot of other people
6733.46s:  like something so yeah I from a from Newton standpoint I get it but from something like this I don't fully get it and that's what I'm trying to understand.
6747.46s:  Because in this yeah because in this case it literally could be a million of different kinds of things VWOP is described as a price insensitive by order to satisfy an order left to the last data settle.
6762.46s:  Wait that confuses me now now I'm now I'm not following.
6777.46s:  I'm trying to see if I can find any articles on it if you guys know any let me know.
6792.46s:  Because I know I know a few things that might be useful.
6813.46s:  But I'm guessing it might be an HFT.
6822.46s:  Yeah so all right let me.
6825.46s:  I think he means VWOP is a buying order no matter what the price is because they need to settle yeah see that's the thing that was that's not what a VWOP order is.
6835.46s:  Stories of opacity says I think Richard believes when a VWOP order hits it can be used to help figure out a timeline I'm also.
6843.46s:  Let me see I am going to.
6847.46s:  Add this to our to do list for next week so that I can learn more about it.
6854.46s:  Because here's here's what I would think my guess is that there this is more so like a dark pool.
6866.46s:  A dark pool slash HFT triggered.
6871.46s:  That's my guess.
6874.46s:  So from like my interpolation of this is that it's expected that there's some some sort of.
6885.46s:  There's an expectation that funds use VWOPs specifically.
6891.46s:  And because funds and other entities use VWOPs as conditional buying circumstances that it would lend efficacy behind if he buys moving into other VWOP resting VWOP or penning resting VWOP order types that it would cause a big move like that's my guess.
6911.46s:  But I don't know and that's exactly why I'm asking the question to see if you guys are looking at this in the context of some sort of value idea if it's some sort of technical component like I'm talking about in terms of.
6925.46s:  HFT inclusion or fund inclusion stuff like that.
6935.46s:  Jotato says perplexity a Wops is view outboarder can decrease volatility on large orders. Yeah, definitely so yeah, I totally get that night ham says what the fuck did you say can you explain it to me can you explain it as if we eat crayons.
6956.46s:  That's so funny.
6966.46s:  How do I think that's so funny I love that response so much.
6976.46s:  Let me think about it so there's a there are different order types that mean things to different entities there's things like T Wops and VWOPs T Wops or time weighted average price VWOP is volume weighted average price.
6997.46s:  So they mean slightly different things but when you look at big institutions they're incentivized to try and manage entry price that's essentially why we have things like dark pools is it is the effort of those entities to manage their entry prices to avoid being pushed around or people front running the orders and moving things.
7022.46s:  So like a great example of this is the flash crash in 2010 that was essentially a messed up order entry where they used VWOP instead of T WOP which would have helped their exposure and it would have moved completely different.
7041.46s:  So they'll use those kinds of order types to fill positions while trying to be more sensitive to entry price and to not be front ran this is again like institutional side of things so when I think about this theory in general that's what I would personally take away that it's predicated on that behavior but I didn't know from your guys perspective like what this looks like or what I'm going to do.
7070.46s:  So let me know if that makes sense as if you e crayons the summary of that is institutions might want to use these and it's to try and be more price sensitive I think that's the best guess.
7099.46s:  So anyways back to this this makes sense to me and then this also makes sense right like because I know and this is something that Newton is brought up and we've had good conversations about it I'm still unsure because from Newton sheet it shows that essentially R K is never decreased his position size one of the problems with Newton sheets is that he has so much stuff.
7129.46s:  So often here that's difficult to find.
7137.46s:  Did I pass it already.
7140.46s:  Over here there it is over to the right is a cheeky over to the right so what Newton showed me is that he's never decreased his shares now again I see Newton's point but the way I look at it is.
7157.46s:  I am not convinced that R K is maintained static positions essentially from the time that he's added each of these we know this probably not to be true with the most recent trade in chewy like it probably is not the case like I just I'm not sure that he has
7182.46s:  a lot of things for 100 million dollars now after the recent pullback and game stop unless I don't think he pulled anything out at least based on the subsequent account updates could have but I don't think he did so this to me I'm unsure
7202.46s:  what if he used capital from selling calls I think the problem is with the call theory one I would see more of that volume especially against 9 million shares and it but he could and he could be generating premium by selling calls the problem he would have if he does that is that he would be capping some of the upside on his position and I'm just not sure that he would do that.
7231.46s:  So I don't know maybe you guys have seen him sell calls before like in some of his other updates I just haven't seen that yet and it doesn't necessarily fully seem to align with the positions that I've seen him share with us because he could have sold calls at a bunch of different points here.
7251.46s:  So yeah.
7255.46s:  Kev said bought to call calls and sold Jamie or even chewy yeah maybe banana says his last yellow update fell ages ago it was the 13th of June so a month ago and in this he had 9 million game stop at 23 4135 for 262 mil 6 mil cash total account value 268 mil.
7279.46s:  So yeah it's definitely been a minute.
7284.46s:  Yeah interesting.
7287.46s:  Let's finish going through this before a hop off and if there's anything else you guys want to hit quick before I bounce feel free to start throwing those in now so that I don't leave you hanging.
7299.46s:  This makes sense essentially saying that he probably.
7304.46s:  Exited and he's just providing you know basis for it.
7311.46s:  This is looking at potentially when he sold it looks like which I could see right that's a lot of volume down volume.
7322.46s:  Purchased 9 million 25 to 25 up that lines up selling price 27 and a half a point to yep I could see this.
7336.46s:  Alright so what's the plan.
7340.46s:  So he thinks the move is going to be in chewy.
7345.46s:  Hopefully that the buy in is going to create a bit of a movement which I could see so that happened on 24 June is when the entry look like it occurred.
7364.46s:  So then one two three four five.
7378.46s:  So then this week if this thesis is correct this week we should see some pretty significant movement.
7388.46s:  Now we're doing the emojis thing which I don't know like this here right like if he posted that on 15 May again like this being interpreted as spy crashing 2% I just don't see.
7405.46s:  Like I don't see how we could logically conclude that on the 15th of May when he posted that that he knew that on the 22nd of July spy would fall 2% I just just don't see that.
7423.46s:  Peyton welcome to outliers supporter thanks for supporting the channel really appreciate that thank you very much.
7430.46s:  I don't know about cycles but from buy to squeeze 27 trading days so this is postulating 20s or I say so he's going back.
7452.46s:  So I said but the famous guy predicted stock market housing crash you up Michael Burry what about it.
7459.46s:  Michael Burry saw something completely different and I think you might be misinterpreting what I'm saying I'm not saying things can't be predicted of course they can.
7466.46s:  Right like I can predict where I think the stock market is going to go in two years and with something like positive drift I know it's pretty fair certainty that it will be higher.
7477.46s:  I'm going to know about Michael Burry in the big short though is he missed time to his entry terribly and he almost went insolvent he almost had to close the fund he had to go to extremes essentially disallowing people from pulling their money out because if they did he wouldn't have been able to hold the position long enough in order for it to potentially pay out.
7502.46s:  So the first thing is Michael Burry's position was predicated on really hard data observable data that can you literally can draw very logical conclusions from the idea that with those kinds of positions and seeing essentially the way that MBS securities were being built that like his conclusion was very very much.
7529.46s:  And the other thing I would offer with just context for Burry is that if you watch the rest of his calls he's been wrong a ton and that's not to cast rocks I'm wrong a ton myself we're all wrong a lot.
7540.46s:  But that's the nature of predictions right is Michael Burry is really remembered for that one that he got right in a really big way because of how harrowing of a story that was.
7554.46s:  The kind of over shadows all the other times that were completely wrong and that's essentially some of what you see there so yeah I think.
7565.46s:  Yeah I think it's important because it's completely reasonable to make predictions and it's part of the process of being a trader but it's a difficult game I think.
7577.46s:  Payton says the flag emoji Mike emoji and then music L S XM plus Siri.
7585.46s:  I don't know I again like I don't really mess with the emoji change too much I just I just struggle way too much to believe that he would again like even that right there right if he made that post on 15 May.
7604.46s:  I just do not see him essentially forecasting the creation of those three emojis to mean 16 aug calls like I just I don't see that.
7620.46s:  So yeah I mean to me I don't really I don't see much there.
7624.46s:  Payton says what do you think about.
7630.46s:  No he is in the 16 aug calls now that's from saying is like I don't see I don't see the connection there Payton you're saying that.
7641.46s:  He knew that yeah so here's the deal that merger has been on the table for a long time I think people are really really mistaken about this the Siri merger.
7653.46s:  This has been announced for literally since December of 2023.
7658.46s:  So what he did not know is when this merger would gain any semblance of traction because it's been underway for so long.
7667.46s:  Mergers take a long time so what I'm saying is of course you knew about the merger we all knew about the merger literally from last year we knew about the we knew about the merger.
7681.46s:  So what I'm a fonds of says first emoji was not on the 15th but the 12th if it matters thanks for thanks for the correction at least it doesn't matter in the context that I'm talking about it but it's useful and I'd rather have the correct date anyway so I appreciate it.
7701.46s:  But what I'm highlighting here is like this merger is not new and when he made that post specifically on the 12th then I don't think that there was any reality where he was like combining those three emojis to forecast the 16 aug calls you know as part of a position for him based on some expected new emergence of information regarding this merger that has been underway for half a year.
7729.46s:  So again I want to go all the way back could that have been the case it could it could like technically it could but I just view that is a highly low probability event personally.
7744.46s:  So.
7746.46s:  Pains is what do you think of the chain.
7749.46s:  He could be anybody could be yeah so the thing is is like I have no idea what we're in kiddie is trading I have no idea but it there's a lot of activity in here anything that's going through the process of a merger or acquisition it's going to be super active because people are going to speculate on whatever they believe the terminal value of the product is going to be a lot of activity in here.
7776.46s:  And then I'm going to be that's being bought out because there's a potential trade opportunity there now the risk in the trade is if it doesn't happen and again a great example of this is if we use Twitter because Twitter shows you the exact price performance of something that is going through a series of maybe maybe not so let me move this out to like I don't need five years and look for years.
7800.46s:  So here's the deal there's the original rumor of a buyout right stock shoots up on the buyout news hangs out then news of the buyout starts to get digested it looks like it's complicated looks like it might get blocked and it starts to decline then it looks like there's better news about the buyout higher probability price drifts up towards the buyout price.
7824.46s:  Then it essentially falls through Elon starts seeing all these shit about fake accounts starts trying to back out of the buyout and then all of a sudden Twitter falls back down to pre buyout levels hangs out hangs out hangs out until it starts looking like buyout probability is going to start going up and then you can see when the probability of the buyout became near terminal with this giant skyrocketing price and then post price drift this is when the market became more certain that the buyout was going to happen.
7854.46s:  And it eventually happened what on 28 October something like that is that right.
7861.46s:  Jordan is it I don't remember no not October I forgot exactly when the buyout happened but the cash merger this says 1028 so in this case anyways what I'm highlighting is you're seeing something that from the literally April out until November was going through the
7883.46s:  cycle of trying to understand this buyout opportunity it's the anything that's going through a merger acquisition goes through a similar path because there's a lot of hurdles they have to get over some of them are still happening that you've heard of before with really big companies.
7899.46s:  So yeah all I'm saying is that this the buyout with serious nothing new the information there is nothing new it's been digested for a long time and the options chains being active in something like Siri is completely predictable because of the merger news people like me will trade that all the time now something like this you can come up with a lot of interesting ideas based on where you see most of the activity.
7929.46s:  So yeah there's a ton of different ideas you can draw from this but yeah it does not surprise me at all that there's activity in here but that is not the point of the street.
7943.46s:  We look in at some game stop and it is actually time for me to run it's been absolutely awesome hanging out with you guys thank you guys so much for sharing more of the story with me I look forward to next weekend getting back in with.
