0.00s: Okay, awesome.
2.06s: I could even
2.60s: everybody air here. Welcome back to all the outliers. We're kicking off another
6.56s: outlier podcast. I got my friend Patrick here. We were literally just talking about
10.00s: TA. So one, welcome back, but two, let's get right back to that conversation. You were
14.32s: talking me through the context of using technical analysis and relative time frames. And I thought
19.80s: it was too good not to record it.
21.44s: And well, I'm happy to be here. It's always been like that. Like always the conversations
25.28s: I have with the interviewer before. It's like, man, even me when I we host people, I say,
31.64s: okay, I should have a habit of hitting record. And then just because there's stuff, it's
37.12s: gold. And yeah, I look time frames. I posted something on Twitter. I could maybe share
42.92s: my screen there. Yeah, just to show people.
48.52s: Right. You should have rights.
51.80s: Yeah, there you go. So I did this a while back because
56.12s: okay, chart basics on charts, guys, chart trading. And I'm always trying to, I don't want to
61.64s: use the word educate, but just share this information in chart trading. Everything is defined by
66.92s: time frame. And often you'll say somebody, oh, I have a breakout breakouts confirmed. But
71.88s: people who don't know about chart trading, they just hear the word break out. And they think it's a
75.48s: buy. And then they take their mindset, their time scale and they apply it to that word.
82.44s: But you have to know where did that breakout? Where was it defined in what realm? Because if
86.52s: the guy says it's a daily chart, define breakout. And you think, okay, I have a breakout.
91.16s: I'm going to write this for eight years. No, there's going to be many breakouts and breakdowns
95.88s: on the daily chart. While if you have a long-term scope, you should probably be looking at
100.52s: quarterly charts. And because if you have a chart, define breakout on a quarterly chart,
104.92s: that thing's probably before it breaks down, you're going to get five, six years, whatever you're
111.00s: able to run. But within that, there'll be runups. Then you'll have breakdowns on the smaller time
115.24s: frames. And then we could use like shorter term moving averages to be able to exit into that,
120.92s: like, you know, shorter term, formal. So depending on the chart type, candle, candle charts,
127.16s: line charts, point figure charts, they each have their own parameters because I can't,
133.48s: and they each have their own time frame. And all that has to be pondered and weighed accordingly.
141.64s: So that's why I love December. December, it's crazy. I reckon we're coming up. December,
146.04s: guess what guys? December 29th, it's a yearly candle close. It's a semestual candle close.
151.72s: It's a quarterly candle close. It's a weekly candle close and a daily candle close.
155.72s: Man, I'm going to be working during the holidays. If ever you get, you do it only once a year,
160.92s: guys, look at those yearly charts, those semestual charts and quarterly charts like now because you
164.76s: might have the greatest entries right now after Christmas when you get those yearly candle closes.
172.44s: And if you get a synergy of all those breaking out at the same time, it's like,
177.24s: gold and it's like people looking at the gold chart, gold had a weekly defined breakout,
181.72s: had a monthly defined breakout. They not have a daily yet. It could possibly get a quarterly
188.36s: breakout and yearly and semestual in a week or two. So if you're patient before just like jumping
195.24s: in all in, just give yourself a week or two, let the dust settle. Let's see how the year closes.
201.16s: And that could remove a lot of noise because I've seen so many times people jump in.
208.76s: Let's say even somebody says, Oh, look, Patrick, I'm on the monthly chart. The price is way
212.68s: above. Let's have a breakout line at a thousand. And during the month, the price, a thousand,
217.32s: two hundred, it's convincing. And I've seen it so many times, even me, I fell for it. Oh, man,
221.96s: it's not going to go back down below the breakdown line. There's only two, three training days.
225.32s: And guess what happened? Bam, the price goes below the breakout line. It leaves a wick, which I
230.92s: call noise. That's why Japanese candles. They're like awesome because it's the clothes that matters,
236.28s: the body and the wicks was noise from the smarter time frames. And how many times I've seen
243.24s: these possible breakouts, but because I did not wait for the monthly close, I got track. Look,
248.60s: I could, you have the best example here. I'll show you the, let's go down memory lane. I'll show you
254.12s: the goal chart. Here is the monthly candle chart. And guys, it's always important to, if every
259.96s: you want to, on the chart, always look at the here, right here at the time frame. All these wicks
269.48s: here, somebody could have thought it was a breakout. Oh, look, during the month, during the
273.00s: month for one month here, it was out of the cloud, two months, three months, four months, it was
277.48s: above this breakout breakout line. But every time it's track people, track people, track people,
282.60s: which you want to do is you want to wait for a drastically convincing breakout.
288.52s: Like this removed all doubt, it cleared, even cleared the wicks, which is optional, but it solidly
295.08s: closed above all these, all these closes. And that's how you reduce noise. And this is how you
303.32s: have a higher probability of having a sustained run is once the market is clear. And look,
312.04s: this is another thing. People often tell me, well, Patrick, you missed that 70% move. Well, guys,
318.28s: this is a, a revelation I had recently is a good chart trader will learn to know which moves he
327.40s: needs to avoid, which moves to not enter, right? Like, you don't, you should never have formal,
333.72s: as you see this going up, but you know, you have a clear breakout line above. This move, yes,
338.36s: it's adrenaline rush and it's bonkers. And you say, I'm going to get in early because I'll be
342.92s: able to buy more. And then I'll make more money, right? The greed factor starts ticking, but you
348.76s: got to say, look, it's going up, but you want to be trapped, unless your play was to buy like the
355.24s: move up and sell at the resistance. But if your idea is to buy anywhere in this basing formation,
361.24s: because you wanted to play the fast, remote, reverse, mature upwards, then the probabilities.
367.88s: As long as you're below this line, the probabilities will always be lower for you to have a crazy move
374.68s: like that, then after you're above, because once you're above, then this resistance now becomes
379.96s: support. And so like 80% of the time you have a pullback. And, but this, this one was so convincing.
387.56s: We did practically didn't have a pullback, but most of the time you have some type of pullback to
391.80s: retest it. And then it shoots up. So never fear missing out the the line share. I tell people, it's
399.00s: this, this move here. This is a line share of the trade. And you can't even catch probably the top.
405.96s: I mean, somebody could have probably even sold even a previous highs, even here at the wall,
410.84s: the move, you could have just traded this, this move here, you know, huge base. And in two,
417.16s: three months, bam, hit your like, it's done, right? The move's done. But this, this is these are the
422.76s: lower risk plays. So this is like where we are today for gold. A lot of people like, oh, I can't go
429.56s: down. Well, look, I don't know if you, what if your thesis is wrong? That's why I tell people,
435.24s: people in hindsight, they say, oh, look, I told you Patrick, I bought here. I'm a genius. Well,
439.40s: okay, well, what if the price would have went down? Like, how do you, how do you conciliate all that?
447.16s: Always wait for the breakout. And even after you get a breakout, it could still fail. So it's not
452.92s: 100%, right? It's not 100% probability. But statistically, these, once you've cleared convincing
460.28s: convincing resistance and breakout line, you're supposed to, it's supposed to, to, to go like that,
467.64s: right? 80% of the time. But if it doesn't, then no, no problem. It fails. Falls breakout, you
474.20s: exit and you wait for a new pattern to morph into existence, right? And each felt time you get a
478.60s: felt breakout, a new pattern morph into existence. And then you just wait, you don't want to get trapped.
483.72s: Anybody who bought here, unfortunately, they, they got trapped. See all these weeks, that was crazy.
488.44s: I look at these weeks traps. Even me, you should, I was like, emotions, they get you, right? Oh, look,
494.36s: the price is above. But look, by the end of the month, the price sunk back, sunk back, all these
499.48s: weeks. But look, I know gold did a crazy spike overnight there, but it doesn't get more convincing
506.20s: than that there. Like, unless you get something like you had back here in June of 2019,
511.96s: that monthly camel clothes was very, very convincing. And even here in three months, this month,
518.12s: the price that, WIC, the price action was all the way down here during the month. It was red candle,
522.52s: it looked terrible. But then after that, the buyers, they came in. And what we have right now is
529.56s: some type of the spinning doji, it could be here, like here in January of 2020, February of 2020,
536.84s: we'll have to see if that's going to be a continuation or a top. But your above resistance,
541.88s: the trend, your above a one year moving average, above the each mucleague, above the three moving
545.64s: average, the bias is on the monthly timeframe, the bias is, it's upwards, right? I know I've been
553.16s: hearing people like giving some, some $1,200 target for gold and all that, which is fine, but you have to
561.64s: weigh that, what are the probabilities of having 1,200 gold at this stage today? So I would tell
569.32s: people as long as you're above an inklining when you're moving average and you're above a rising
573.80s: trend line above the three or moving average, then the probabilities are reaching 1,200 right now,
579.72s: they're just not there yet, right? It's just like here when the price is going down for gold,
584.44s: and somebody tell you, well, gold has to have to skyrocket back up to 2,000. Well, the
589.80s: probabilities of gold skyrocketing to 2,000, as it's trending below a three year, trending below one
596.36s: year, the lower, they're just lower and then just need time to heal.
602.12s: And yeah, I'm sorry, I just went off on a tangent there, but all these things, they all link up
608.92s: together. I could have done this on the, let's say we have the quarterly close for gold.
617.88s: So this is what we're dealing with for the quarterly close.
621.48s: Because even here, this is very aggressive. It's a rising trend line when it breaks to the
629.72s: upside, often either it's a false breakout and the price reverts down or you create some type
637.08s: of like sometimes some people call it a livermore accumulation there and it squeezes up and then
642.44s: it just goes bonkers. We have to wait now for the end of the month. There's that week. If gold is
648.68s: able to close, 2060, 2070, like anywhere, the higher it is, the better it is, then that's another
656.60s: milestone in favor of gold, just like, you know, pushing upwards. What about the yearly? I could
666.20s: even do a yearly chart for gold. Yeah, look at that. So on the yearly chart,
672.04s: that's a pull flag, right? Pull flag and that would be a continuation breakout, right? Then you
683.56s: could start doing measure moves. I don't know where maybe it starts here. You'd add that here and
691.24s: then that would be your measure move. Yeah, 2700. It looks great on the yearly. So there's a,
697.40s: people have to measure timeframes and you'll see here, this is another thing. The higher the time
703.80s: frame, it's kind of fun though. I hope a lot of people get to watch this. The higher the time frame,
708.28s: the lower the threshold for a breakout. Because the time frame is higher, there's more time for the
716.68s: wicks to form. The more noise, the higher time frame candle. So this is 12 months. It's the whole year.
725.56s: Look at the breakout line here. It's 1900, 1897. The breakout line for this continuation.
733.08s: It's much lower than on the, where was I on the monthly? On the monthly we had,
741.00s: see, here's the, the yearly one, the monthly, it was 1990. And even the daily,
749.40s: it's probably even higher because the daily chart is, there's a lot of closes on the daily chart,
755.24s: which is actually the wicks. Well, it will be the wicks. Most of the, a lot of the closes will be
760.28s: wicks from the higher time frames. So let's sum up the daily chart. It's like, there's no confirmed,
767.40s: I'll put here on the line chart, just to remove the noise. Look how much higher the price point
773.40s: you need on a daily close to breakout. So the higher the time frame, so often, I don't know,
779.72s: you know, sometimes they have some teachers, Eric at school, they let when they explain something,
783.72s: they put the pros and cons of each thing. So yes, oh, that's a big tank. It's strong, it's powerful,
788.68s: but on the downside, it's slow, you know, it can't maneuver. So the time frames is like that,
792.76s: the hard time frames, like the big tank, the powerful, once they get going, you don't want the,
797.32s: you want to buy the dips once you have a higher time frame, confirmed breakout. But the short
803.40s: time frame, there's not even a confirmed breakout on the daily chart, practically. It's, you'd have to
809.08s: maybe draw a slanted one, make a case, but it's noisy. You see, even here, you could have had a
813.80s: false breakout on the daily chart, it failed, but now because the monthly and the weekly broke out,
819.40s: it's offering that longer term support to help the daily chart, you know, push upwards.
825.96s: And you're letting me rant too much, Eric.
830.28s: I like listening. That's why I like doing these is I have an opportunity to learn with everybody else.
836.68s: One of the questions I had those early on, you were talking about the relevancy of a close versus
841.08s: a wick. Can you talk more about that? Yes, definitely. So let's go back to the candles.
852.28s: Here, I could even do, I have, I'll do one better. Move Drunks. I'll put a horizontal, a vertical line at
860.84s: three months. Okay, when did this, when did the year begin? The year began January 1st.
867.48s: Let's do, let's do the last September, October. So September was the quarter, quarter start,
873.00s: September. And here we are today. Right. I'm on the daily chart. So this is probably going to be here
882.04s: when this is September, October, November, no, October starts, October 1st.
891.40s: There's a whole bunch of closes here on the daily chart. Right. And here you could say I have a breakout
897.56s: right here. There's a breakout here. Then after that, it tests some longer term
903.96s: price action. There may be a, that's probably even a false breakout here on the daily chart.
908.84s: If I stretch, if I stretch that, possibly the false breakout on the daily chart.
914.52s: Now, the month started here. The price went all the way up here.
920.36s: Keep going up. So the quarterly, the quarterly, the quarterly,
924.76s: handle chart will start green at the bottom. Go up. But because right now we're below
932.60s: the, the beginning of the month, or we're not at the high, we're below the high of the month.
938.12s: This will be a week. All that noise here is going to be a week. And the higher the price goes
943.72s: before we close the end of the month, that noise intro month will disappear. And hopefully you
949.56s: get a Maribuzu candle where it's the close, the entry and the closures, practically no weeks,
956.52s: it's just power power, no starters coming in. I'll just put on the quarterly.
962.76s: Reset chart. Zoom in. And you'll see, look at that. So here, here's the quarterly close.
968.20s: It's beautiful. Here was October 1st. Well, yeah, it's going to be here when we're done. And now we
974.60s: have just that WIC here have to remove these lines. That's the WIC from the smaller timeframes,
978.60s: which needs, doesn't need to disappear, but that's that spike we had in the month going there.
984.12s: But right now that's noise. And if ever the price goes back all the way back down to 1971,
992.28s: then you don't even get that breakout there. It's totally, and that's
996.52s: currently the fine breakout is not there anymore. And it just it trapped anybody who
1002.92s: thought this will close. Above that breakout line here for the quarterly chart.
1008.68s: Did I help? I might have confused things a little bit. It's a, I think so. I think the way you
1014.28s: framed it is pretty clear in that you view the WICs as shorter term noise and the close is the
1022.76s: more dominant feature for you. It's yes. And look, another way to do it, guys, if you don't just
1028.36s: put a line chart, just put line chart. And that's it. There's no noise here. It's you get these are
1034.44s: closes, but yeah, you have to understand that there will be noise from the smaller timeframes. And
1040.44s: yeah, you could do it at old school, just just a line chart. And that's fine. I just like knowing
1045.48s: what's the beauty of being on the monthly chart and having candles is you're able as a chart
1051.96s: trader once like you used to it, you see the closes, right? You could practically visualize the
1055.80s: line chart there. But I like knowing the WICs because the WICs give you details from the intro month,
1061.32s: right? Was it an exhaustion WIC? Did some crazy action happen during the month? Because that's another
1067.16s: thing I put on Twitter is I would always rather a month that starts week, but calls it strong.
1075.08s: It leaves a WIC here like some type of capitulation WIC, you know? It went super weak. Here's
1081.24s: a WIC. The price goes up. It closed strong. I would always rather that than a month that starts
1087.64s: strong and then closes week and then leaves like here like a huge like the whoever's like the
1095.08s: hedge funds like I don't know they especially the quarterly chart, you know, the readjusts,
1099.56s: rebalanced ETFs, the you know, they're not day traders like huge money those capital flows,
1104.52s: the readjusts at the other month, end of the quarter, stuff like that. And they could just like
1109.16s: bring the price down back below. I don't know. Of course, I would always the best case is the month that starts
1116.60s: strong and end strong, right? Everybody wants that. But so that's why I never I don't feel too much
1122.92s: formal like intro months. Oh, the daily chart and gold's going crazy or any instrument there.
1127.32s: Now we're just picking on gold, but it goes bonkers. It kind of scares me sometimes because I said,
1132.12s: okay, if the sellers come in, they could create some type of ugly ugly candle because it might
1137.00s: like back in March of 2022, what do you think the feelings was for everybody here? Like I could
1142.52s: even do a trick here for you. I put the fast forward button. I put play. See, oh, it's too fast.
1150.20s: I'll slow it down. It's anyway just let me just back it up.
1159.32s: It's replaying the month. See, during the month, I just put on pause. During intro months,
1164.12s: that candle looked like that. How many people
1167.96s: gold's the best? The rest is the worst. You know, all the gold bugs jumping up and down there.
1172.52s: Like everybody was supposed to be crazy here. But if you continue playing it out,
1176.92s: oh, the sellers came in at the like and the buyers weren't able to bring it up. Then we get a new candle
1182.36s: and all hopes, hopes and dreams got shattered there. Like the the bulls of broken dreams are.
1189.00s: It's terrible. What do you think about picking the correct time frame to analyze something?
1197.56s: How do you do that? The Holy Grail of time frames. Well, the first thing
1204.76s: people have to match is the time frame. They have to match time frame with their emotional.
1209.40s: Yeah, the good trader has to understand his emotional state of mind.
1213.72s: Is he there's a guy want to be super active? Because if he's on the monthly candle chart,
1217.72s: he's not he's going to lose patience. Right. You have to match the time frame with your
1223.24s: emotional profile, your emotional capital. Like, are you going to want to check once per month for
1227.64s: breakouts? Then if that's all you want to do, then you have to go to the monthly candle because
1232.12s: you'll get all the advantages of the monthly candle with and the draw downs of over trading. You
1236.68s: don't care. You just want to trade once per month to readjust your assets. But if you're somebody
1241.72s: that wants to check every day, then maybe a daily chart could be good for you. But the advantage of
1246.76s: guy who does it for the daily, if he happens to coincide his buying at the beginning of a month,
1255.48s: then it's win-win for him because he gets to leverage a hard time frame and he's still in his
1260.60s: universe of the daily chart. Look, there's no, I'll tell you at the pros and cons, to
1266.52s: longer the time frame, the lower the threshold to get in, but you have to wait way more before
1272.36s: you get to enter, but it will create more powerful moves. The dips will be bought more often than sold
1281.08s: on the higher time frame you are and the shorter time frame while you get to participate more,
1284.76s: but you will get website so much more. So it's crazy on the daily chart there. But
1293.40s: it's funny you bring that up because when I look at my world, which is primarily derivatives,
1299.00s: it's the same thing. Traders like trading shorter-term time frames, but that's exactly what happens
1306.60s: there as well as they just get pieced up and then they wonder what happened. So it's just funny to
1311.72s: me to see completely disparate styles of trading, but some of the same underlying tones, one being
1317.56s: extended duration, and you might find things to work a little bit better for yourself.
1322.84s: Yes, and it gives you time to breathe. It gives you, like, you get to imagine if I told Michael
1327.32s: Jordan and he's in the playoffs and the defenseman will give him five, 10 seconds extra for him to
1332.36s: take a shot. Maybe okay, it's perfect, you know, but we're not all Michael Jordan's. We can't always,
1337.40s: we don't have his emotional capacity. We can't be rushed all the time with Twitter info with
1341.56s: fun and people do fundamentals on top and they're analyzing this and move so fast. Goodness man,
1346.36s: that's going to give me a heart attack, you know. So it's and you might make more, you might make
1351.96s: mistakes, you might make operational mistakes. Just hunching in the order, the sound stop,
1356.68s: your minute mistake and then something gets triggered. The markets of all tile,
1362.92s: the you could get crazy setups like you had in FedEx could go down 10% one day, up 8% the other day,
1368.84s: and then you're if you know what I count for like eight, if you don't use like ATR or some type of
1374.04s: thing to help you like measure the volatility, the man you the market loves just grabbing you,
1381.08s: you know, grabbing those self stops. I like I don't want to go in conspiracy theory, but
1385.48s: the the markets volatile enough to like if you're too close to the action, you're going to get
1393.24s: though you get triggered out before your profit limits will get hit like practically a lot of the
1397.72s: times, right? It's yeah, I did it. I used to do like a lot of forex. I was on the shorter time frames
1403.16s: playing the news releases, economic news releases. It was like it was, you know, you have to adjust
1411.24s: your style, the timeframe to your style. And so that's probably number one. Look at the mirror guys,
1417.00s: understand what type of personality you have, how much time you have to allocate to this,
1421.00s: and then I think your trade don't get a lot better once you match the timeframe to your emotional
1427.08s: state of mind. Makes a lot of sense. I think that applies to trading writ large. So again,
1432.44s: that's another very common theme I find even with derivatives trading again, people have to figure
1440.44s: out if they are looking for lower win rates, but bigger wins that necessitates a certain kind of
1446.12s: strategy. The inverse necessitates a different kind of strategy. So just another parallel, it's
1451.48s: funny because when you talk to traders, there are commonalities amongst all of us slightly differences
1457.96s: between what we might look at, what we might use, but threads like that, I find to repeat
1462.44s: themselves, you talk a lot about trading bullish directions. Do you view bearish trades as well? Do
1470.12s: you put those on or not so much? Well, not so much like, let's say somebody wants to short the SPX,
1479.32s: but if you look over long, long periods of time, let's pop up the SPX there. The SPX has everything
1484.92s: going for it, even the NASDAQ. Let's think like it's an index, the 500 top companies, it gets to
1490.92s: rotate out the least performing companies. So it's already that. It's got 11 sectors. So the least
1497.24s: performing sectors could pick up the slack. So when the top ones like don't really do that good,
1503.72s: so the draw downs, there will be draw downs, but it's got, it's like, I have a 200 year chart,
1510.28s: here's the SPX, 1871 guys. It's, if you zoom out, it had periods of time where I went sideways
1518.60s: for 10, 15 years, 10 years here, 10 years here, but overall, statistically, it's more up
1525.96s: than down over long periods of time, right? So on that basis, it's, you got to be really nimble,
1532.44s: you really got to understand the evidence. So let's say I want to short the SPX like, let's say the
1537.40s: GFC, well, here it was a higher probably short because it was SPX had already broken down versus
1544.20s: inflation or versus PPI versus CPI versus gold. So it was more at this stage here, it was more
1551.32s: probable of failing this rally and getting a rug pull. So here you had, I would, you could have
1555.64s: probably shorted, but it could have been shallow like here, you know, here, even SPX broke down
1560.84s: versus PPI back here, but they're tricky the short. So I rather, I'm currency pairs, I wouldn't
1568.12s: mind where it's a zero, zero sum game, like that direction there, but when I see a chart like that,
1573.96s: the SPX, I would rather wait until it's bullish and buy the dips, or instead of shorting the SPX,
1581.80s: see what it's underperforming and go the other asset that's going long, that's outperforming it. So
1587.64s: here is gold SPX here breaking down versus gold in 2002. Instead of shorting the SPX and because
1594.60s: of all the reasons I mentioned there, it's like all the money's flowing to that always, it's like,
1599.24s: it's a great adieu, it doesn't rush, everybody like goes bonkers, oh, the dowels down 800 points,
1604.68s: they have today, it's crazy feeling, right? Especially if you have a little bit of contrarian in you,
1609.08s: and you want the system to break, but statistically, it doesn't happen as much as people think it
1617.56s: should happen. So if the SPX is breaking down versus another asset class, I would probably look to go
1623.32s: along the other asset class, which is outperforming it because I'll show you something here, here's the
1629.32s: here is gold versus SPX, and I'll just overlay the SPX on top of it, and I'll overlay also gold,
1641.16s: and you'll see here that goodness, this scale has gotten this up, you'll see here that while the
1646.60s: ratio of SPX versus gold is just plummeting, look at this here from the 2003 bottom, here's gold,
1652.44s: 2003, SPX and gold go up together, but the ratio goes down once outperforming the other, and that
1660.44s: is good because liquidity is going in SPX, golds sensing or pricing in whatever the
1667.32s: montaire imbalances, the destruction of the fiat required to save the SPX, and then you get a double
1675.32s: whammy, now gold appreciates some price and gets the support that the SPX is getting on the way back
1682.84s: up until one day the SPX breaks out versus gold, like in back here, 2013, gold breaks down and then
1690.76s: just go long SPX, so yeah I would short stuff, I would short more, let's say like anything that
1699.96s: goes against like against this talk market, that probably short that while this talk market's
1707.16s: going hot, then the sectors that are doing so good, probably like let's say energy, gold and
1712.52s: silver miners, they're just terrible like 90% of the time, it's kind of weird Eric, I don't
1717.24s: know if you know this but people are attracted to what is statistically least probable because they
1723.88s: have some clickbait type of gain attached to it, it's like people want to play the miners all the time,
1730.12s: but statistically if you don't, if you don't have TA to time, your entry in the miners,
1735.00s: you have a higher likelihood of just dollar cost averaging in losers for long periods of time,
1740.52s: then actually piling on into something that's actually going up, right, it's like the mindset of
1750.76s: regular people is not what a trader's mindset should be, right, a trader's is like either we learn
1758.36s: because we've brought our narratives and biases to the chart and then it has to go up because
1764.04s: they need solar panels, so server has to go up, but you're not even looking at the price,
1768.52s: then after losing so much money, I guess people learn either they learn to accept that the market
1774.04s: is always right and we're always wrong because I, I definitely know that I don't know anything,
1779.72s: seriously, it's like whenever I think I know something, the market humbles me, so Patrick,
1783.88s: what are you doing? That's why I've learned to go back in my shell and look at the chart because
1789.88s: the price is never wrong, never, it's like I, I tell people that it's like you could have a story,
1796.28s: a fundamental story, the Pne, whatever, it looks great, but the price, you'll never make money,
1803.64s: if the price is not going in your favor, never, no matter what story you have, you know, and that's
1807.80s: nothing as dangerous as you have a story, a narrative, the price goes up and you're aligned
1813.80s: with your narrative, then you believe your narrative is driving the price and when the price
1817.72s: starts faltering, you don't believe that the market, you don't understand, and then you think the price
1821.88s: can go back up, it never does because the narrative never changed because you'll hear
1826.12s: echo chambers all the time about narratives, right? Tesla's, EV, the EV craze, you know, it's always
1833.08s: it piles on, right? And you seek those news also, you'll seek, you'll follow people who,
1839.16s: who will reinforce your bias, right? Even as the price is crumbling, 10%, 20%, 50%, and you'll
1844.28s: keep following these guys even more, it's a, it's tricky. I forgot, I think I went totally on the
1849.48s: tangent there, but it's, yeah, shorting, you could do it, but a zero sum game, much easier,
1857.56s: the probabilities, but in short, shorting a US stocks, you got to be like a surgeon precise and
1863.56s: make sure you have the weight of evidence that they're, they're really, really in a bear market there.
1868.60s: Yeah, it makes sense, especially for the time frames that you're looking at, I kind of generally
1873.24s: expected that answer from, from your side. You mentioned earlier some different candlestick patterns.
1880.12s: I spent quite a bit of time, probably 10 years ago, doing a lot of analysis and just regression
1887.48s: on the accuracy and efficacy of candlestick patterns. What are your findings on the highest
1895.24s: efficacy candlestick patterns? Well, let me just remove that.
1904.52s: The most efficient, it's practically, you have to think it like in their physics. The slanted lines,
1910.44s: the more as line is slanted, and I'm going to put my angle thick line here. So here you see the angle,
1918.76s: the more the angle, no matter what pattern you have, whether it's a bearish rising wedge or like,
1925.56s: this is not related to specifically to candles. Did you mean like doggies, reversals, engulfing
1933.32s: candles and all that? Did you mean specifically the Japanese candlestick patterns?
1940.20s: What I originally meant was the candlesticks themselves, but I actually like this direction more
1945.24s: anyways, because I'm more of a formation slash shape. I know trader, so this is a perfectly fine
1952.68s: direction. Yeah, I don't understand the Japanese candles, the patterns, the doggies, the spinning
1959.24s: tops, but I don't trade solely by those. I'm a classical TA guy first and foremost.
1965.72s: The angle, while a bearish descending wedge, maybe I didn't drop, the target is essentially this,
1973.00s: what I've what I've seen and with the like we have a trade tracker with performance dashboards,
1978.44s: this is what I call a one star breakout. These are low probably trades. These, while the targets here,
1983.96s: they don't often go there at the first time and that's often the bear market rally here that
1988.84s: traps everybody. Everybody thinks, oh man, it's breaking out, but you're breaking out of what,
1994.04s: you're breaking out of a steep descending trend line. So the momentum is, it's like you're jumping
2001.56s: down here. If you jump, if ever you want to get your foot again for jumping again, you might even
2007.48s: go lower. So sometimes often here you have like you even have you have a read goodness. See the
2013.96s: the read test while it wasn't that it went low here much lower than they went back all the way down
2019.00s: here. Maybe that's not a good example, but this has to go in loud chart. That's why that's why that's
2025.32s: why I look funny. The steeper the angle, the least probable the price goes in the V shape up.
2034.52s: After that here, you would have had a less steep angle, six degrees. So this is what I call the
2039.96s: early breakout line. A lot of the hard work, the basing is done by here. You went up, now it created
2044.92s: a swing, a pivot swing high here. After that, it did it again, again, whaling tight. So the early
2054.28s: breakout line is fine, but the best one is a horizontal plane. A horizontal plane has no more
2061.72s: bearish momentum, right? Because you have to see those trend lines or the steeper they are,
2066.76s: the more bearish momentum. There's still a lot of sudden pressure. The base, the horizontal breakout
2072.68s: line has it's a flat plane. There's zero momentum, but it's it's even more bullish because it has zero
2077.72s: momentum. And if every get a breakout, you know that's a zero momentum, but you're adding bullish
2084.84s: momentum because to break out of it, that means you're starting from below it and going above. And
2089.88s: that's creating the initial thrust of upwards momentum, but that upwards momentum is not
2095.88s: fighting a declining plane. It's fighting a flat plane. So it has almost no more, I don't know when
2101.32s: you want to call it type of gravity or kinetic energy, dragging it down as much as it did back here,
2106.68s: right? So this, these are very high probably like this. There's so much high probably these huge
2114.76s: basing patterns with flat planes. That's what I play. And we've played all these. That's why we know
2119.48s: statistically that these practically either they don't work out, we could have happened here. I'll
2125.80s: tell you one thing here. And it practically almost did back in. I'll have to cancel this thing here.
2134.36s: Look at here. Look at the gold chart here. It was a breakdown here. People that if you buy here
2142.84s: on those slanted planes, the more the slanted, that could have just kept going down was below the
2148.04s: one year, below the three year. Like this could have happened here. People don't think of that in
2153.08s: hindsight. Oh, the gold price went up and they forget that this was actually a roadmap. If you would
2157.08s: have asked me back in 2018 to see that chart, just like that without other way of learning, I
2162.68s: could I would have told you my bias is neutral bearish because when mommy to tell you, there's a
2169.56s: it's unless it's a false breakdown and reverse through the like a reverse move upwards. Until that
2176.76s: happens, this is what I have in front of my eye. I have to deal with this, right? So you cannot
2181.88s: be long here unless you're a knife catcher. If you want bragging rights, but I don't care. Like
2186.68s: nobody should be. I'm never impressed with somebody who tells me he bragged that he bought the low.
2191.56s: It's like it's nonsense. I rather have the low in the rear view mirror.
2199.40s: And the market's telling you that it's already trying to create upwards momentum. So that's a great
2203.16s: example. Same thing here. Look back in the low and the steep, even if the crazy move upwards,
2209.96s: you're still not on the park. And over time, it creates, oh, look at that minus eight degree instead
2215.48s: of minus six degree. So a lot less downwards force. And eventually you get a horizontal plane
2222.84s: above a wall. Here's a support turn resistance. It was resistance here. Sellers got in. And that was,
2230.92s: look at look how well it held on the on the the retrace. I said like I think four times out of five,
2236.12s: there's a there's a retrace to the breakout line. Retrace and bam, you buy that that was
2243.08s: off it went right. So horizontal planes are any pattern that has a horizontal plane in it.
2250.04s: And that's why people sometimes they said head and shoulders. Well, what is head and shoulders?
2253.48s: Why are they so powerful? Because the breakout is a horizontal plane. And I don't really care about
2259.08s: the the left shoulder, but the right shoulder will be, well, let's say it's a head and shoulders
2264.12s: bottom. The right shoulder will be a higher low, right? So in higher lows, what is that? That's the
2269.40s: beginning of a nap trend, right? All upwards trend have higher lows. And eventually once you're
2274.84s: above the horizontal plane, that means it confirms that you also have a higher high. So now you have
2280.44s: you have a channel, you have higher lows. And the horizontal plane confirms that you have a higher high.
2286.20s: And then that that's bullish evidence. It's a bullish momentum. It's a nap trend. It's all the
2293.40s: characteristics of a high of a higher probably trade. How well does this kind of thing apply to
2301.48s: various timeframes? Well, it's like inception in the movie. This everything I described here
2308.68s: applies to any single time frame. So the time frame is the multiplier of the pros and cons of
2314.92s: that. So I could have zoomed in this pattern here, this fractal here probably appears 100 times
2320.84s: on the hourly chart. You could probably see these like all the time there. I even did one recently
2325.72s: on Twitter. Let me just zoom in. I did the gold to I did silver. But here's silver to SPX. I'll just
2335.24s: go in here on the one hour chart. We said, charge you look at that. It's like, let's say I would hide
2340.92s: I would hide here the time frame. It's the same same concept here. I have a descending
2346.68s: 44 degree. You see that that breakout here. It's not the one that brought it back to the top.
2353.56s: Then after that, you have a slightly less deep. Oh, cool. The markets. It's creating a swing
2360.84s: highs. Then after that, you have a horizontal plane. Then each time these horizontal planes
2368.36s: are you have to always look to the left as far as you can to see meaning. So that's the same thing.
2377.80s: I'm on the one hour chart. If I go on the monthly, you sign on the monthly, right? This thing does
2384.28s: it's nothing on the monthly, right? You reset chart. Look, it's these are all my lines. I could
2389.00s: practice and I'll see it. But so it goes with the pros and cons of that time frame, right?
2392.92s: That let's say you have a bullish pattern on the one hour chart. But if you don't zoom out
2399.16s: to the higher time frame, that bullish pattern might get a rug pull because you might be hitting
2404.60s: monthly defined resistance might be hitting a 12 month and average going downwards. So if you ever
2410.68s: want to play a shorter term time frame bullish setup, make sure the time frames below it or above it
2417.24s: the four hour eight hour the 12 hour the daily, you're not going to hit any resistance and you're
2422.76s: actually in a nut trend in those because if you're in a higher time frame defined up trend,
2427.72s: there's more chances that capital flows go in and saves your butt from the instead of me having
2431.96s: a false breakdown on that one hour chart. I have more chances if there's just influx of money
2436.84s: coming in and oh, I reach my target. So it's all about probabilities, right? So you could zoom on
2442.12s: time frame, but always be aware of the entire ecosystem of time frames that are out there.
2449.08s: Yeah, makes total sense. It's one of the things I look at a lot. Most of my trades are shorter
2454.92s: duration than year plus, but I actually talk about a lot of the very same things. So again,
2462.20s: I can't help just find it funny that different styles of trading, but very similar things
2468.60s: that you're covering here, which is pretty interesting to me. When you look at these different
2475.00s: ratio charts, I remember the first time I talked to you, I thought that was pretty neat that you
2479.24s: looked at a lot of these different kind of ratio charts, we're looking at one now. What's the
2483.88s: thought process behind those? And if somebody was new to them, how should they dip their toe into
2491.24s: using them? Okay. So if I would do a ratio charts, like essentially people are looking at
2497.40s: ratio charts, they don't even know it because any instrument, it's a one unit. Let's say I go to
2503.48s: Amazon before that's a ratio chart. It's one share of Amazon divided by the numerator's Amazon
2510.52s: and the denominator is one unit of US dollar, right? Or it costs, yeah, so it's the unit. So here,
2520.36s: I need 250 or wherever the prices today. I need 153 units of US dollar to purchase one share of
2527.40s: Amazon. That's a ratio. So by using ratios other than Fiat, because Fiat has been the, there's a
2533.64s: destruction of purchasing power of the Fiat has been going on forever. So US purchasing
2539.88s: per just a preface this. This is your purchasing power guys since 1913. So unless we go in the
2552.84s: Great Depression, for anybody that's just listening in, it's essentially a completely negative
2559.00s: sloping line. The best way to describe it. Unless we have the destroy money, unless they
2565.80s: we have a huge deflation and the actual remaining US dollars are able to purchase more units of
2572.44s: more shares, et cetera. It's, it's, we've been destroying purchasing power forever, right?
2577.16s: Like it's our bread and gag. Everybody knows it. We have analogies, a cart of milk, as your grandfather
2581.64s: I love, like, you know, when I was young, I didn't understand there, but when you sit chart like
2586.60s: that, it just goes down. So yes, Amazon's going up, but the unit you're measuring it with might be
2594.36s: Amazon shares might be going up because the units you're measuring it comparing it to are
2599.48s: going down, you know. So are you really making money or you're just, it's just because the unit
2605.88s: is losing value. So if you go back to SPX divided by, so if you want to do racial charts,
2612.92s: the first, the easiest one to do guys, whenever you want to buy, price it in gold. I even have here
2618.52s: an indicator here where I have, by default, whatever instrument I have, let's say, let's go,
2627.00s: let's go pick on the Russell here. You always want to outperform. So here I have a ratio of the
2633.72s: Russell versus gold. So that's why it looks like the racial chart versus gold. Here's the rate,
2638.68s: the Russell versus SPX. So that's what the racial chart of SPX of the Russell is worth versus
2646.04s: SPX. So you want to compare with major asset classes. You want to, if you're the Russell or any
2653.24s: instrument, if you're not outperforming the SPX, you have to ask yourself, why am I, why am I
2658.04s: long this this company there Netflix or whatever? I'm not even outperforming the index. And if you're
2662.84s: not outperforming gold, the another different asset major class, because I've shown you where,
2670.12s: where there's secular bull markets and US growth stocks, there's often a bear market with gold,
2677.88s: with commodities, et cetera. And when commodities are in bull areas, then there's often a stagnation
2684.12s: period with possible rug bulls and US growth stocks. So you want to be outperforming SPX and
2691.40s: outperforming gold to have in your head, you should always imagine, what's my percentages of
2697.00s: headwinds versus my percentages of tailwinds I have in my trade to have a successful trade. So
2701.56s: Russell right now, while it's going up nominally, it's underperforming SPX and it's still underperforming
2707.16s: gold. It doesn't have all the tailwinds it needs to really be in the sustained uptrend. So that's
2713.40s: a lower probably play. I could pop in, let's say I put in, like segue, I trade a lot of IWM.
2722.28s: So I have to grace the IWM gods with a compliment because we're talking a lot of shit about IWM
2728.28s: right now and I don't need them pissed off at me. So IWM, you're looking great out there. Anyways,
2734.92s: back to you. Well, nomally could do great and like you told me, like if you're on a short time
2744.12s: frame, it's like that movie, the ant, you could tell me Patrick, I don't care about the hard time
2748.20s: frames. Hey, I'm on the 15th second candle, Patrick. And you're right. Sometimes you're so small
2753.56s: that it practically doesn't matter what happening to storm out there, right? It's like you're at the
2758.84s: atomic atomic level and I'm outdoors, you know, playing. So I've had that thought, like if the guy
2764.28s: really zooms in, like on, it might, he might get in and out of this trade and he's oblivious to
2771.00s: what's happening on the outer, outer realms, right? So that is a distinct possibility that the
2778.20s: gods of the, the Russell might still be happy with you. If you're trading on a short time frame,
2781.96s: it could, it could still look great. Well, I mean, realistically, I'm going to lose money in it.
2786.28s: Anyways, I just don't need more shit stacked again. I mean, I'm just trying to make sure I give
2791.40s: them a goat sacrifice later today to get back into their good graces. I do that also. I used to do
2797.24s: that when I used to play poker. I'll always sacrifice two goats before I go on the poker online.
2801.80s: Always. It never quite worked out for me though. I know it's not working at all, but I'm running out of
2807.40s: goats. Oh my goodness. Well, like Wells Fargo and they're their example versus gold. It looks
2815.24s: like it's trying to wake up and versus PX. What do you make of oil?
2823.56s: Oh goodness. Oil.
2829.00s: Oh man, it's a reset charge view. And that wig kills me. They really kill me with that negative
2834.28s: wig there. Oil is in, it's really, it's like hanging on. It's like it went up super strong.
2844.36s: You could still consider this a longer term back test from this peak in 2008, one touch, two,
2851.64s: three, four. Here was messy, broke out, retest. So this is a clear valid breakout. But again,
2857.32s: it's not a horizontal, you know, like we just talked about there. The final, final breakout is
2862.28s: probably going to be here. If ever oil is able to close above 115, then it's going to be probably
2869.32s: bonkers. So for me right now, it's in a back test configuration, but it's mixed signals because it's
2873.80s: below the three year, it's below the one year moon average. It's above the cloud. It's above right
2880.44s: here. There's some, it's like a pivot line resistance, support support resistance support.
2887.32s: It's, look, I'll zoom in here. It's, it's in survival mode right now. It's like it's above support.
2895.16s: But you really want, you can't, it's hard to have a position here because you want it to at least
2901.16s: clear, clear, clear this line here. And even this line, it's provisionary because it only has two,
2906.12s: two bounces for a line to morph into existence. You need three reactions. So we might have
2913.08s: what small reaction here to confirm that line exists. And then we probably have a move, a reverse
2918.92s: switch, move back to 115. That would probably be the play eventually there from 81 to 115.
2925.64s: I mean, but it's got a, that line, this has to support this confidence here of support.
2933.48s: All this, all this, this has to hold here. And there's a lot of volume base, like a huge volume
2938.36s: to find base right here, right below. But you want that seven year hold. Goodness, man. It's like,
2947.40s: yeah, that's how I see oil right now. But there's, there's some good signs because some of the
2952.12s: tankers, they do, they're doing great. So if you look at other, other instruments, like front line,
2960.04s: like there's some, the oil shippers have been doing great like for a long time. These things
2963.48s: paying 17% dividends. Like we've been in this thing for a while. And these, the, the oil tankers
2969.08s: have been nut trans for a while, right? So there's some bullish signs in the, for oil that what we're
2977.08s: living through right now is simply a more back test of that breakout line. And the markets are
2982.84s: pricing in ahead of time, a rebound in oil, because the, yeah, the oil plays are, they're not that
2991.00s: bad. The oil plays there. How do you view looking at subsidiaries of broader commodities like this?
2998.52s: Because that's actually an interesting angle that you're bringing up in. I'm curious how that
3002.36s: broadly applies. So in this case, we're looking at an oil tanker in relation to oil that apply
3008.04s: across sectors across commodities to you. Always, always. And if you wanted people to know the
3013.56s: next step for racial charts, it's the same thing. So let's say I would take, let's say oil was
3019.24s: breaking out. Okay, fine. Oil's breaking out. Then is oil breaking out versus exo p, let's say
3025.40s: the sector of the ETF. You would want the sector to be outperforming oil in a bull era. And look,
3034.60s: look at this man, this actually oil has broken down versus exo p, which is bullish for the sector.
3041.88s: So even if the oil price is has consolidated and retesting that 70 70 level, the,
3048.60s: the oil plays have actually are outperforming. I could have actually done maybe visually it's going to be
3056.52s: easier if I do exo p divided by oil.
3068.92s: And it's that. It's so messy.
3072.12s: I already have to zoom in. Sometimes to move noise, I go on the corley for the oil chart to remove
3079.32s: that wick. See that crazy wick? How it didn't because the price didn't last long there.
3087.32s: So yeah, there above the, that's a three year moving average. And that's the nine year because
3093.56s: I'm on the higher time frames. So it's looking not bad here. So the, that looks like a
3099.16s: pull flag expanding wedge here. A good decision.
3108.44s: So that's a good sign. Yes. So you could use like that if the underlying leverage plays to the
3114.36s: commodity or outperforming the commodity, that's full throttle for the bull era because often it's
3119.32s: the top layer commodity that has to fight versus yes px has to fight versus gold. But once the
3127.56s: major commodity has a capital flows, then after that, the metrics look so much better for the
3134.68s: companies that are dependent on the price of that commodity either going up or going up right,
3140.04s: they want that commodity price to go up. So this is very bullish actually there. I haven't
3143.96s: looked at that. Thanks. I'm going to have to divide that one because I haven't looked at the exo p
3147.64s: by oil price recently. I kept looking at exo p versus spx, which is a baseline, but this is a,
3154.84s: yeah, this is a good sign there. Interesting. I think what's even more interesting is that you said
3159.88s: you had a nine year moving average, which I can unequivocally say, I've never had one of those on
3165.48s: my chart. Are they fun to watch? I imagine they're boring as shit. Yeah, too long. Nine years, look,
3171.24s: nine years, it's a, when I do the big picture, seven years, eight years, moving average, just,
3176.92s: just a really, really long term moving average there. But to trade,
3181.16s: what you could, you could do is you could have that moving average. It's fine. Understanding where it
3187.64s: is, it's great because let's say here I'll put, instead of my 12 month moving average, I'll put the,
3193.24s: the nine year, which will be or eight year, even seven years long. I'll put seven year.
3199.96s: Understanding where you are, you see here when you had the breakout in June of 2019, you were
3205.16s: right above the seven year, which is great. And look, see how you got stretched away from the seven
3210.20s: year. Here was a pullback. You don't want to still, you don't want to be too stretched from any type
3215.16s: of moving average because the more stretch you are, the more you're at risk of exhaustion, right?
3222.68s: You want coiled and tight. Here's the, here it is, a seven year and the three year coiled and tight.
3228.20s: That's where the price of market is, okay, I don't know where to go anymore. And once it takes
3233.88s: a direction, then it allows for price expansion, right? Because the further you are from moving average,
3239.64s: the more formal there is, the more people are making money, the more they're talking about
3244.12s: they're making money, the more people at the water cooler are buying. But once everybody's bought
3249.88s: and you're super stretched from the moving average, then naturally there's only one place could go.
3254.60s: You have to let the moving average catch up either via a violent bear market or a sideways move,
3260.28s: where you could let those moving average catch up and replenish, let the, the ones who got in low
3267.08s: let them exit, let them take profits, get out of the game, and then after that let new people come
3272.04s: into buy. But you don't want to be too stretched from any moving average, right? The best is when the
3277.88s: seven year, three year, one year, one month, all those moving averages are, well, here I have a,
3282.92s: here I have a setup here called the heat map. I have the seven month all the way to the five day
3290.12s: moving average. And you'll see that often the best moves, look at that, it looks like a rainbow. You've
3296.20s: seen these rainbow type of indicators. Well, here in June of 2019, you have the shortest of time
3302.68s: frames, plus the seven hundred day moving average, which is not that bad a year and a half,
3307.64s: boiled and tight, boiled and tight, man, you got to get people have to focus on
3313.40s: queiled and tight, not, let's say you tell me about a Patrick, I think it golds a buy,
3319.88s: everybody's talking about it's a next thing, Peter Schiff says it's going to 5,000. Well,
3324.12s: I will look at often if somebody tells me or somebody from my family tells me to buy something,
3329.40s: often I'll look at the price chart and I'll have something like this where the price is getting
3334.04s: so stretched from the longer term moving averages, where it's just it's just asking for pullback.
3341.00s: Just like here, look at that, look at the beautiful pullback that GFC here, it was getting stretched
3345.08s: from the moving average, either consolidate sideways here, but it could also come in the severe retest
3350.84s: of the seven hundred day moving average, like a here goodness, look how tight and cruel that was,
3356.12s: goodness. So that these are the setups, the gen like the setups that don't happen often here
3362.44s: and here it's we've had it just again, this is just a coiling and tightening pattern and if it
3368.28s: starts moving up, the further you are away, the more the move has been engaged.
3375.80s: I couldn't agree with you more on the tight, I think everything's better tight, real big fan of
3385.08s: tight. So for anybody listening, I feel like if you needed a solid moniker to get better at
3392.04s: understanding moving averages, that's the real, I think that really sticks through for me as the
3397.16s: tight, just like a nice bench press, a solid tight elbows for that drive. Hell yeah.
3406.52s: Oh man, well, yeah, I'm gonna get in trouble. So I'm gonna usually get in trouble, but so hard
3413.88s: to do that joke. I've been watching the office recently and that's what she said jokes, they're just
3418.28s: the best man. It's like they just before the woke culture came in, you could see the woke
3423.64s: getting in towards the end of the office there in 2008 or whatever year, like, oh no, maybe later
3428.68s: there, but the beginning of the years, it was like just, I was bonkers at show, I love it.
3435.40s: That's exactly the setup for that joke I was just doing anyways, right? Obviously I'm talking
3439.96s: about other stuff, but I try to make everybody feel like they're fucking creeps by talking about a
3445.40s: sick bench press, which is also great. It gives some tight elbows and a good bench press, but
3450.28s: well, I'm sure we've made a lot of people laugh and good for them if they caught on there. I love it.
3456.68s: Yeah, good. A couple of other questions I had for you is looking back at 2023, what stood out to
3464.36s: you? So if you are a relatively new trader, you're building your technical analysis, understanding
3471.88s: and awareness, what are some things that you saw this past year that you think would be good for
3477.96s: them to take a look at as a reference point as a data piece that they can integrate into their
3483.72s: broader technical understanding. Well, goodness. Well, I think it'd be racial charts understanding
3491.80s: if you should trust or not a is it a bear market rally or not? Because sometimes even if like,
3497.48s: we did the Russell chart, even if nominally, I'll do it again for the Russell. I'm going to anger
3503.16s: the Russell. The Russell guy is going to say as long as we're not talking shit about the Russell,
3507.16s: we're good. If not, I'm going to have to start lining up more goats, man.
3511.88s: So look here, here's the Russell. I'm sorry. I like picking on the Russell because it's the weakest
3517.64s: of the Russell actually is the it looks exactly like the inflation, adjusted version of the Dow Jones
3524.68s: or the SPX. The Russell is like a play on the capacity of the major indices to outperform inflation.
3533.72s: But in any case, here's the Russell. So 2023, right here. So while we know the Russell is driving
3541.88s: upwards or trying to, it's still hasn't broken out versus gold. So it doesn't have the headwinds,
3547.56s: the tailwinds that it needs to be successful. So that's I would always look at racial charts. If
3553.56s: you're outperforming a competitive asset class, or let's say NASDAQ is probably outperforming gold
3559.08s: in 2023, hasn't broken out yet, but it had tailwinds more than had more tailwinds and headwinds
3568.76s: going into 2023. Oh my goodness, now in 2023, it had a broken it broke down in 2022.
3577.72s: Yeah, 2023 was starting to, let me just put my black line here.
3583.48s: Yeah. So that was a positive here. So somebody would have looked at the racial chart of NASDAQ versus gold
3591.56s: as it was bouncing above the cloud here. But goodness, it's not, it's not the best of scenarios here.
3599.24s: It's like it's still goodness, the way you'd still want, remember, like I said, those steep lines,
3607.72s: the off there, sometimes you have a rally, you have to wait until the dust settles. I'm really
3612.12s: curious to see how that's going to end the month, because what I'm expecting, I want to see if
3619.88s: we're going to get some type of a more coiling tightness. And that's probably a play I'd be more
3626.92s: interested in playing here. Something really, I can't even say the word anymore, but it is what it is.
3632.92s: It's tight and coiled above the moving averages. So I don't want the NASDAQ to break out here and
3637.72s: go bonkers because it's not creating the optimal entry port for me. I would rather it
3643.64s: has something like something like this here where it's really creating a strong base where I could
3648.92s: have a crazy move up here with less chances of ruckus. But yeah, look, the early twit, we're going
3655.80s: to know soon there, because here we had here here, did it pretty violently there.
3661.32s: Yeah, that was going to be my next question is when there is so many, I don't want to call
3665.72s: artificial factors because they're all market factors. But I look at Big Daddy J. Powell
3670.60s: interest rate scenario and how much that affected markets. How does having again, I don't know
3677.00s: what to frame them. I've always used them as artificial inputs because the market might want
3680.84s: to be do whatever it wants to do, but it has this constraint. Does that factor into these kinds
3686.68s: of setups for you? Like does it have to be quite as coiled in tight for you to respect it as much?
3692.12s: Or if that broader macroeconomic picture is changing, which would ultimately impact stuff like
3698.76s: this, does that give you a little bit more leeway with the setups that you would accept?
3705.80s: The macro, as a pure, pure chart trader, the answer is the macro, all macro known elements
3713.08s: are in the chart right there. So if the some crazy macro thing happens,
3718.44s: the the market is going to price it appropriately. If I don't get the pattern, the tight
3724.20s: coil pattern that I want to play, then I might not play it. So whatever the reasons are,
3730.76s: so let's say, because it's hard to tell like,
3733.32s: consumption example, because yeah, there's a specific scenario I'm thinking about. So right now,
3738.92s: we have, like what we see right now isn't quite as consolidated as you would like it to see.
3747.24s: Let's say in the next week, Powell came out for whatever reason and he says, I'm going to cut rates
3753.48s: and then all of a sudden that starts to fly off the handle. Does that lack of basing still impact
3761.48s: your decision cycle against that to your point new macroeconomic injection of information that
3767.48s: then might change the landscape? I'm curious how you view the basing patterns. Just so you understand
3772.44s: the meta portion of the question. My assumption is that all the aggregate of market participants
3780.60s: are going to price in the probabilities of Powell doing whatever he's going to do. And a lot of people
3786.12s: managing way more money than me are going to place their bets, right? According to, well, even the
3791.56s: Fed fund futures, right? People know actually like, if he's when he's going to cut or there's
3795.48s: pro odds of, you know, having cuts, all that stuff, all the mechanics, it's like, I clear my mind
3802.12s: and I just say the aggregate of market participants will be the price chart.
3810.76s: That macroelement, I kind of dismiss it. I'll say, look, I'll let the market participants figure
3814.84s: it out. If I don't get the setup that I would relish like something like this and I'll just move
3821.48s: on to another instrument where I can. And that's another thing. Sometimes on Twitter, I get
3825.88s: people, well, Patrick, you're not playing Bitcoin, whatever. Well, I tell, look, I don't have
3830.84s: the setup where I know I have higher probabilities of getting my target. If I don't have the setup
3836.12s: I'm looking for, even if the price goes up 10 fold, if it just rocketed 10 fold and I couldn't get
3843.24s: in because I couldn't anchor self stop appropriately, I couldn't get my risk to reward the three four
3849.08s: to one, whatever I'm seeking. I'm just not going to play. There's so many instruments. I'm not
3853.40s: attached to Bitcoin, I'm not attached to NASDAQ. I'm not attached to any single instrument.
3857.72s: If there's a chart with enough liquidity in a sector that's breaking out versus the other
3862.20s: asset classes, has that pattern that coiled like, like, I'll put PBR here. Here's another one.
3868.76s: Maybe like that. That's that's an oil play. That thing gives you 18% dividends.
3875.96s: I've been, we've been eyeing this thing for a while now because look, it's doing the coil. Look
3881.00s: at that thing. That's ready to, it hasn't broken out yet, but that thing is a candidate, like a 10-year
3889.48s: 13, what is that? 10-year base. Man, I rather play that than play NASDAQ going bonkers off a pattern
3898.84s: where I can't anchor my stops or like, it doesn't matter. I'm happy for you NASDAQ, people
3904.12s: whoever played it, they made, I probably have to go on a shorter time for him to play NASDAQ.
3907.96s: I probably get my coil then tight on the weekly or maybe on the daily, I could probably play it,
3912.60s: but on the monthly on that chart, it's going to be difficult, but this is what I'm seeking
3917.56s: there, these crazy patterns. They're all over the place. You just have to do the work and look
3924.20s: for them. That answers the question perfectly. It makes a ton of sense. You definitely have a
3930.52s: clear preference for your setup. If there's a specific catalyst that causes a movement, but your
3936.60s: setup still isn't fully formed, you seem to prefer looking for an alternative that has the setup
3942.76s: that you're looking for. Yes, yes. I dig it. Yeah, and it's fun. You say that about the, like,
3948.84s: the federal funds rate probabilities and whatnot, because I typically agree with you, I think the
3953.16s: markets are much smarter than I am, but obviously the injection of new information drastically changes
3961.40s: probabilities of things. That's why I'm always curious how that fits into your bigger probabilistic
3965.40s: outcomes. If you look at the probability of a cut a month ago, it was like 29% whereas if you
3971.16s: look at it now, it's like 82% for the March meeting, which is that much. That's a beauty of
3979.80s: charts because I don't have to look at everything. I have that there's 10,000 analysts on the planet
3987.24s: that are reporting to their Jamie Dymons of these worlds. They're doing the work for me. They're
3993.32s: spending hours and hours crunching all that data for me and doing recommendations and they're buying
3997.72s: and they're doing the work for me. I used to go look at the fed fund rate. I used to actually do T.A.
4003.32s: on the chart of the fed fund rates changing. And if I would see a breakout in the probabilities,
4007.96s: I would apply that same logic. Oh, I have a breakout. So I would go for it before there was actually
4013.88s: the cut. Let's say it was at 2020, 20%, and then it goes to 40, but I had a clear breakdown line
4019.32s: or breakout line. It's a man or it's going to happen. There's a hard probably chance that we
4023.96s: will cut and I get ahead of the curve and play that, but I haven't done that in a while. Right now,
4029.16s: like I'm focusing all that stuff there, the probabilities of everything. It's like sometimes it's
4034.84s: like I feel like I've done the I've done the down too much. It's like it'd be that simple. Like I'm
4041.40s: I'm letting everybody else do the hard work. I'm just focusing on finding the the end set of
4047.72s: their focusing on getting the higher probability plays pure like just on the charts there.
4054.36s: Yeah, I think it's a bit of a balance. I think we all go through that phase. I was actually
4059.56s: checking out your website just to get reacquainted with you guys a little bit more. And I saw you
4063.40s: essentially started trading right when I did in 2007. So looking over that time frame, I have done a
4070.84s: very similar process where things got very busy. A lot of noise, a lot of stuff. And then I look
4077.56s: at what I do now and a lot of it is very basic in its structure. So I really believe a lot in
4083.56s: Leonardo da Vinci's concept of like, you know, simplicity is the ultimate form of sophistication.
4092.36s: He did. And it's one of the best things that we talk about in the Marine Corps as well,
4096.68s: which is brilliance at the basics. If we have dudes that can do all sorts of really cool maneuvers,
4102.12s: but they can't fucking reload their rifle, that's useless to me. So we need to be really good at
4107.16s: the basic things. And it's really impressive. Actually, like the outcomes you can produce,
4112.52s: if you're really, really, really structurally sound at the basic stuff. So Patrick,
4118.36s: it's a blast chat with you, man. Like I really have it opportunity to learn a lot. That's one of my
4123.40s: favorite things about doing the podcast is I get a chance to really peer into other perspectives.
4128.28s: And one of the goals is to just promulgate these different approaches to markets. So thanks for
4134.12s: hopping on and spend some time chatting with us. Quick question for you. I will throw links to your
4139.80s: Twitter and your website in the notes below. But is there anywhere else that people can get a
4144.76s: hold of you that you want to drag them to? No, that's great. We have a YouTube channel also.
4149.80s: People could go check out there, North Star, bad charts. And yeah, no, it's fun, Eric,
4156.28s: there maybe we could host you there on our show there whenever you're available there. I could
4160.28s: be fun also there. It would be absolutely blast. And I can bring the goats so that we can get the
4165.16s: I go, we own gods on our favor. And I will be ready to talk about coiled and tight as much as you
4170.20s: are. So whenever you're ready to rock and roll, I am. Let's do it, man. All right, Eric.
4176.20s: Our products guys. Thanks for hanging out.
