0.00s: What's up, outliers? Quick market update before the live stream later today. We had a bit
5.32s: of a mix of bags. So although futures are now up slightly, we saw the S&P 500 down
12.04s: tick just a little bit and a couple of things unfolded here. First thing is XLR real estate
19.24s: fell off a cliff here. So did XLV. And I referred to these for the sectors, not the ticker
24.52s: self. So obviously real estate, healthcare, and then we have XLP, super staples. And interestingly
33.00s: enough, we see technology ticking up a little bit. This is actually because in video,
37.84s: his hit all time highs, which we're going to take a look at today. So I want to spend a minute
42.12s: just talking about the market in a broader sense here because there's a really interesting
47.00s: trend that's going on. One of them is notice how many of these sectors are read and how
54.24s: many of them are green. All of them are read. The only one that's green is tech. There's
61.36s: almost an inverse relationship at this point between the rest of these sectors and tech.
67.12s: Now it's not purely inverse. I'm using it pretty loosely here, but I am highlighting that
73.28s: there's a clear breakdown in the relationship between these. Now if we take a look at Nvidia,
80.36s: Nvidia just hit a high of 143 71 and it is pin there. So if we go out all the way, we are
87.64s: hovering literally at all time highs. And they have earnings coming up soon, which is really
94.60s: interesting. Their earnings is slated for the 20th of November. So really strong behavior in tech.
104.28s: If we take a look through the rest of the tech sector specifically, we'll look at information
109.56s: technology and video really leading everybody here. But Apple was also up, AMD was also up.
116.20s: But we can see that there's a little bit of a breakdown in relationship between something
119.80s: like Nvidia and micron, which is interesting to watch. That's stuff that I typically will try to
126.12s: look to play even Intel's playing along a little bit here. So this broad market rally is continuing,
134.12s: but it does look like it's starting to consolidate a little bit. And the performance of these
139.16s: sectors is going to become increasingly important as we're hovering around highs here. I personally
144.68s: come in, I look to set alerts, something below this consolidation low because right now I'm long
149.88s: SMP futures. And if we start dropping below there, I'm going to look to start exiting out until we
156.76s: finish this consolidation and then try to get back in during the next move. This is the same thing I'm
161.40s: doing in some stuff like Russell, even crude oil. I re entered a trade yesterday because crude oil
167.72s: has been running pretty hard. And it had a great day today. And it looks like it might want to
175.00s: continue the rally. So the market is definitely still in this bit of a holding pattern where holding
182.60s: right near highs, which is really good to see. But it's everybody's still waiting for the shooty drop.
188.76s: Now, speaking of the shoot to drop, if we take a look quickly at the Fed watch tool, I won't
193.48s: hurt your eyes with that one first. We'll start with this. But we can see that the probability of a
199.00s: 50 bips cut used to be over 50%. Now it's literally zero. It's completely gone and it's not come back.
205.16s: We're actually seeing an increase in the probability of no cut. So on the 18th of October,
212.28s: this was around 9.61%. Now it's at 13. It was as high as 16.4 within the last week.
219.48s: So what's going on here? It's a great question. But what this broadly tells me is that the market does
226.36s: not have a firm footing on how to think about this upcoming meeting. What the expectations are,
233.16s: because we continue to see this glorious mix of market data flowing through that
241.08s: causes a little bit of pause. Now this coming week, we have a few things on the docket.
246.68s: Series of different Fed speakers happening. We had a couple today. We have a few tomorrow.
252.92s: We have home sales on the 23rd. We have crude oil inventories. Which again, this is typically an
258.36s: important metric. But I think we already have a decent idea of what's going on here. The beige book
263.56s: has not been as impactful lately as it has been in other periods of time. So it's something to be
268.84s: aware of, but nothing to overweight too heavily. Jobless claims. This is kind of a big deal.
273.88s: PMI, very big deal. Because as we continue to get different kinds of economic data,
279.24s: specifically things that show economic strength, that moves the probability of a cut further and
284.68s: further away. The Fed is kind of working off of the luxury of time that they have afforded to
291.16s: them right now, because the economy continues to show so resilient. And the fact that this is an
296.36s: election year on top of that really makes things even more interesting in my opinion.
303.00s: So that's the broad swath of what's happening up to the 24th. We go to the 25th. We can see that
309.40s: there's durable goods, consumer sentiment from Michigan. These are typically pretty important
315.00s: from understanding the consumer standpoint of things. Because right now we do see the consumer
320.36s: is relying more on credit. And we're starting to see defaults, not massively, nothing, you know,
326.12s: lose in our minds. But there is a reliance on on credit leading to defaults, which that's not
332.52s: exactly a ideal look. The other thing that we have going on right now that's worth touching on
340.04s: quickly is earnings. So if we come back here and we grab the calendar, we can see that today
347.08s: we had NUE that was reporting after the market. We have a bunch reporting tomorrow before,
352.20s: after the market. These kinds of things are going to move sympathetically with other names. So
356.76s: what that means is if you have stocks in the same industry that are reporting. So for example,
361.56s: you have Lockheed, Raytheon, and you can better believe that there's a tie between these two
367.64s: and something like Boeing, although they're not the same company. There's differences. Boeing's
372.04s: planes don't fly apparently, but you know, that part aside, there's overlap. So when you see
377.80s: some of these other stocks moving on sympathetic moves that can lead to some pretty cool trade ideas,
382.92s: I think. So I've been playing both earnings releases, pare down because I'm not seeing the same
388.60s: kind of opportunities that I like to in terms of risk premiums. But I am playing the continuation
393.40s: moves very heavily because there's a lot of really heavily moving names. And speaking of heavily
400.92s: moving names, I want to show you one other thing. So you can see NUE ran 34% today. I actually
407.48s: reviewed this not too long ago on a live stream because I have a position on in here. I'm running
411.08s: it via long calls. And then OKLO and WLF are at the top of this list again along with IONQ.
418.28s: These have been running near the top of this list for some time now. And this is just looking
422.28s: at daily gainers. So if I grab a chart and we poke through these really quick, I want you to just
427.64s: take a peek. And any clearly breaking out. And you can see that I'm sliding up my alerts as it
433.96s: goes up. I already started pairing a little bit out of the trade after here. And I'm just going to
439.32s: leave the runners on at this point to see what I can squeeze out of it. But today was a massive,
443.24s: massive gain. This was a giant blow off here. And again, this is just a very standard breakout
450.52s: style play for me. We can talk about that on the live stream a little bit later. If we take a look
455.08s: at OKLO, same story up and up. It's been going up parabolically, essentially from what the 15th
463.48s: it's doubled in price from here, not even from down at the lows from here. So OKLO has been running
469.72s: at the top of this list for a little while. WLF has appeared a few times, same story,
474.36s: breaking up and out. And then IONQ also say like the charts look like I believe it or not. I
480.12s: changed it. It's a different ticker. It's like the same chart. These things are showing tremendous
483.88s: amounts of strength. So I offer this is another way to look for ideas, even though the rest of the
488.76s: market might be looking a little sad, not offering giant moves, giant opportunities all over the place.
494.12s: There's tons of stuff. Always you just have to look anything you want me to take a look at. Let me
499.72s: know. Be an outlier. See you all later.
