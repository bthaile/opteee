 What's up, outliers? Quick market update before the live stream later today. We had a bit of a mix of bags. So although futures are now up slightly, we saw the S&P 500 down tick just a little bit and a couple of things unfolded here. First thing is XLR real estate fell off a cliff here. So did XLV. And I referred to these for the sectors, not the ticker self. So obviously real estate, healthcare, and then we have XLP, super staples. And interestingly enough, we see technology ticking up a little bit. This is actually because in video, his hit all time highs, which we're going to take a look at today. So I want to spend a minute just talking about the market in a broader sense here because there's a really interesting trend that's going on. One of them is notice how many of these sectors are read and how many of them are green. All of them are read. The only one that's green is tech. There's almost an inverse relationship at this point between the rest of these sectors and tech. Now it's not purely inverse. I'm using it pretty loosely here, but I am highlighting that there's a clear breakdown in the relationship between these. Now if we take a look at Nvidia, Nvidia just hit a high of 143 71 and it is pin there. So if we go out all the way, we are hovering literally at all time highs. And they have earnings coming up soon, which is really interesting. Their earnings is slated for the 20th of November. So really strong behavior in tech. If we take a look through the rest of the tech sector specifically, we'll look at information technology and video really leading everybody here. But Apple was also up, AMD was also up. But we can see that there's a little bit of a breakdown in relationship between something like Nvidia and micron, which is interesting to watch. That's stuff that I typically will try to look to play even Intel's playing along a little bit here. So this broad market rally is continuing, but it does look like it's starting to consolidate a little bit. And the performance of these sectors is going to become increasingly important as we're hovering around highs here. I personally come in, I look to set alerts, something below this consolidation low because right now I'm long SMP futures. And if we start dropping below there, I'm going to look to start exiting out until we finish this consolidation and then try to get back in during the next move. This is the same thing I'm doing in some stuff like Russell, even crude oil. I re entered a trade yesterday because crude oil has been running pretty hard. And it had a great day today. And it looks like it might want to continue the rally. So the market is definitely still in this bit of a holding pattern where holding right near highs, which is really good to see. But it's everybody's still waiting for the shooty drop. Now, speaking of the shoot to drop, if we take a look quickly at the Fed watch tool, I won't hurt your eyes with that one first. We'll start with this. But we can see that the probability of a 50 bips cut used to be over 50%. Now it's literally zero. It's completely gone and it's not come back. We're actually seeing an increase in the probability of no cut. So on the 18th of October, this was around 9.61%. Now it's at 13. It was as high as 16.4 within the last week. So what's going on here? It's a great question. But what this broadly tells me is that the market does not have a firm footing on how to think about this upcoming meeting. What the expectations are, because we continue to see this glorious mix of market data flowing through that causes a little bit of pause. Now this coming week, we have a few things on the docket. Series of different Fed speakers happening. We had a couple today. We have a few tomorrow. We have home sales on the 23rd. We have crude oil inventories. Which again, this is typically an important metric. But I think we already have a decent idea of what's going on here. The beige book has not been as impactful lately as it has been in other periods of time. So it's something to be aware of, but nothing to overweight too heavily. Jobless claims. This is kind of a big deal. PMI, very big deal. Because as we continue to get different kinds of economic data, specifically things that show economic strength, that moves the probability of a cut further and further away. The Fed is kind of working off of the luxury of time that they have afforded to them right now, because the economy continues to show so resilient. And the fact that this is an election year on top of that really makes things even more interesting in my opinion. So that's the broad swath of what's happening up to the 24th. We go to the 25th. We can see that there's durable goods, consumer sentiment from Michigan. These are typically pretty important from understanding the consumer standpoint of things. Because right now we do see the consumer is relying more on credit. And we're starting to see defaults, not massively, nothing, you know, lose in our minds. But there is a reliance on on credit leading to defaults, which that's not exactly a ideal look. The other thing that we have going on right now that's worth touching on quickly is earnings. So if we come back here and we grab the calendar, we can see that today we had NUE that was reporting after the market. We have a bunch reporting tomorrow before, after the market. These kinds of things are going to move sympathetically with other names. So what that means is if you have stocks in the same industry that are reporting. So for example, you have Lockheed, Raytheon, and you can better believe that there's a tie between these two and something like Boeing, although they're not the same company. There's differences. Boeing's planes don't fly apparently, but you know, that part aside, there's overlap. So when you see some of these other stocks moving on sympathetic moves that can lead to some pretty cool trade ideas, I think. So I've been playing both earnings releases, pare down because I'm not seeing the same kind of opportunities that I like to in terms of risk premiums. But I am playing the continuation moves very heavily because there's a lot of really heavily moving names. And speaking of heavily moving names, I want to show you one other thing. So you can see NUE ran 34% today. I actually reviewed this not too long ago on a live stream because I have a position on in here. I'm running it via long calls. And then OKLO and WLF are at the top of this list again along with IONQ. These have been running near the top of this list for some time now. And this is just looking at daily gainers. So if I grab a chart and we poke through these really quick, I want you to just take a peek. And any clearly breaking out. And you can see that I'm sliding up my alerts as it goes up. I already started pairing a little bit out of the trade after here. And I'm just going to leave the runners on at this point to see what I can squeeze out of it. But today was a massive, massive gain. This was a giant blow off here. And again, this is just a very standard breakout style play for me. We can talk about that on the live stream a little bit later. If we take a look at OKLO, same story up and up. It's been going up parabolically, essentially from what the 15th it's doubled in price from here, not even from down at the lows from here. So OKLO has been running at the top of this list for a little while. WLF has appeared a few times, same story, breaking up and out. And then IONQ also say like the charts look like I believe it or not. I changed it. It's a different ticker. It's like the same chart. These things are showing tremendous amounts of strength. So I offer this is another way to look for ideas, even though the rest of the market might be looking a little sad, not offering giant moves, giant opportunities all over the place. There's tons of stuff. Always you just have to look anything you want me to take a look at. Let me know. Be an outlier. See you all later.
