0.08s: systematic technical analysis part two
2.76s: the first video walked through what my
4.76s: overall technical analysis methodology
7.12s: is and then the specific tools that I
9.28s: use this video is the next in line where
12.36s: I'm going to walk you through the
14.04s: process how do I bring all of these
16.24s: things together to create a
18.00s: comprehensive picture that allows me to
20.00s: better understand the market that I'm
22.20s: looking to trade what's up everybody
23.80s: Eric here welcome back to all the
25.08s: outliers and as usual a shout out to the
26.92s: patreon family you guys make content
28.84s: like this possible and if what I do
30.56s: helps you consider signing up it helps
32.60s: make better stuff for you guys so with
34.84s: that let's get into the process there
38.20s: are two big things that I'm going to be
40.20s: looking at the very first thing on the
42.04s: Le hand side over here you could see the
43.88s: portfolio my technical analysis weird
46.68s: enough always starts with looking at the
48.20s: portfolio and this is going to be for
49.92s: multiple reasons but it's cuz I look at
51.88s: the portfolio first and I need to
54.60s: understand one of two things what is
56.72s: generating the origin of this trade is
59.96s: is it that I look at the portfolio and I
62.52s: realize that I need something sometimes
65.64s: we need to put on risk you might look at
67.72s: the portfolio and say wow I don't have
70.16s: enough Capital at use I need to get some
71.96s: more out there or you might look at the
73.32s: portfolio and say holy my Beta
75.60s: weighted spy Deltas are so massive right
78.28s: now was that yodling I just heard or did
80.96s: you just say what I thought you said I
82.92s: need to get some short Deltas in there
84.64s: the reason why this is so important is
86.16s: because if there's a need it will shape
88.92s: what you're looking for for what
90.56s: analysis scans we're going to put
92.36s: together to help us find what we need or
95.28s: it might be an opportunity the
97.36s: opportunity is simple it's when you look
99.00s: at something and you say wow that looks
101.60s: interesting to me for whatever reason
103.72s: and a lot of times the analysis is just
105.92s: to help us understand what makes sense
109.12s: in terms of a position that fits the
111.84s: opportunity that we've come across so
114.12s: whenever we're conducting our analysis
116.92s: we're looking to answer a basic question
120.20s: how do I think about this individual
122.16s: thing I'm looking at and what approach
123.96s: makes the most sense those two things
126.16s: that's what I'm looking to answer so my
128.08s: technical analysis is always going to
130.20s: start with an orientation phase and this
132.48s: is where I look at the big picture now
135.24s: to be clear if you were intraday
137.20s: scalping zero DTE options the
139.88s: orientation will probably be very very
141.72s: quick for you it'll be something like
143.44s: how's the stock market behaving how are
145.04s: the indices behaving in a recent time
147.24s: span and then that's about it however if
149.00s: you're generating a six-month thesis
151.08s: it's different things like the economy
153.16s: the stock market the individual
154.56s: Industries and sectors all start to
156.48s: matter much more so what am I looking
158.36s: for in the economy just what's the
159.92s: overall backdrop I'm not here to give
161.44s: you an economics lesson but for example
163.72s: right now inflation is very high I know
166.04s: that that has a negative impact on small
168.04s: cap growth stocks I know that so that
170.32s: feeds into the way I'm looking at things
172.92s: when I'm looking at the stock market I
174.56s: just want to know how are we trending
176.48s: how are the different indices behaving
178.56s: against one another what's our our
180.00s: average volatility how much are we
181.56s: moving per day per week per month it
183.72s: gives me an idea on how things are
185.20s: currently behaving and then the sectors
187.36s: this is important because as I'm looking
189.72s: for let's say risk and I want to put on
192.96s: a bullish trade and I want it to be in
195.36s: an individual stock let's say I know I
197.96s: want to put on a ratio called diagonal
200.24s: something like that and I want to put it
201.72s: on in an individual stock what would you
204.04s: do let's say that this is going to be
205.96s: 3mon trade so let's say we look at the
208.92s: 6month factor and you see utilities is
211.44s: down 11% remember ratio call diagonal is
214.52s: bullish so would you place a ratio call
217.32s: diagonal in utilities which is down 11%
221.24s: on a 6month which is down 9% on a 3mon
224.48s: which is down on a 1 month 7% and in a
229.12s: 5day period it's down 7.3% if you're
232.04s: bullish is that where you're going to go
234.12s: not me to be clear this does not mean
236.96s: that individual companies within the
238.56s: utilities can't do well that's not what
240.12s: it means at all but what it does mean is
242.00s: I'm is I'm looking at trades as you
244.04s: recall from the last video I'm looking
245.72s: for a Confluence of evidence I'm not
247.68s: looking for things to be okay I'm
249.60s: looking for things to be great so if I'm
251.92s: bullish I'm not going to waste my time
253.60s: with the indices that or the sectors
255.32s: that are not doing well not worth my
257.32s: time I'm looking for as many things to
259.64s: be stacked in my favor of my thesis as
262.40s: possible so I'm going to be spending way
264.04s: more time up here in these indices and
266.32s: then what I'm going to do is actually
267.52s: come in and find the strength with in
269.80s: the indices and then I'm going to find
271.64s: the strongest performers within the
273.60s: strongest sector within the strongest
275.36s: sub sector that's how I'm structuring
278.56s: building a profitable probabilistic
280.96s: outcome now a couple other things to
282.88s: note when we're looking at indices and
284.60s: stock market in general you can have the
286.80s: stock market r large not performing well
288.96s: and still have stocks doing well but
290.72s: what I can tell you is that as soon as
292.72s: the stock market starts to turn up and
294.80s: gain some momentum all of the stocks
296.68s: that wanted to perform well and might
298.36s: have been performing okay they're going
299.80s: to slingshot and it's because of the
301.56s: overall movement of liquidity and a
304.44s: rising tide lifts all boats so that's
306.72s: why I'm looking to stack the market the
309.20s: indices the stors all in alignment if
312.68s: I'm looking for a specific thing to fill
314.76s: the portfolio next up we have the trend
316.80s: and strength this is where I'm going to
318.44s: apply all of those tools that we
320.80s: reviewed in the last video the way I'm
323.32s: thinking about this again is I'm going
325.04s: to start with various time frames and
327.28s: analyze what I'm looking at so to do
329.20s: that let's take an example as you all
331.24s: know I like to trade iwm and I like to
333.48s: trade the covered strangle that's one of
334.92s: my go-tos yeah no so in this case
337.88s: let's say I wanted to put on a coverage
339.80s: triangle in iwm is right now the correct
342.56s: time well let's figure it out first of
344.56s: all the coverage triangle for those that
346.04s: don't know is a longer thesis trade so
348.28s: it can be anything over a year but a lot
350.24s: of times it'll have positions that are
351.80s: rotating in and out within a month
353.60s: within 2 months for sure so that's the
355.76s: backdrop so as I look at something
357.36s: that's had this giant decline in recent
360.00s: time am I bullish here now to be clear
362.76s: as I look at this the first thing I'm
364.24s: thinking is am I bullish longterm like
366.36s: over a year maybe maybe not that's a
368.28s: slightly different analysis but if I
370.44s: wanted to start loading things up do I
372.76s: think that this is the right time based
374.28s: on what I'm seeing in recent time and my
375.96s: short answer is no and there's a bunch
377.68s: of different reasons for it the first
379.32s: one is we made lower highs here and
382.44s: we've been trending down if I move this
384.88s: in from a six-month daily into this
386.64s: three-month daily you can see it's
388.48s: really struggling this is why changing
390.32s: time frames is such an important part of
392.08s: this process because it changes our
393.56s: perspective the other thing like you'll
395.04s: recall from the last video the moving
396.88s: averages are almost completely inverted
398.84s: with the 50 just now Crossing underneath
400.84s: the 200 day moving average but the 21 is
404.00s: below the 50 and the 9 is below them all
405.88s: with price below all of them that's not
407.60s: good the other thing I see here is that
409.68s: even if this starts to Rally it's
412.40s: running into a giant period of
414.84s: congestion wow that really got zoomed in
417.08s: um into a giant period of congestion
419.12s: right here and this matters a lot
421.16s: because again if you'll recall from the
422.76s: last video the more recent price action
425.16s: is going to impact current price far
427.56s: more simply from a transaction
429.64s: standpoint because a lot of people are
431.20s: transacting in that area and recently so
434.20s: so this area starts to become
436.24s: interesting in terms of resistance now
438.56s: let's say if I wanted to get long iwm I
440.80s: could then chart the price and see okay
442.84s: well I got from 177 up until 184
447.00s: essentially before it starts to hit this
448.48s: congestion Zone is that worth it to me
451.12s: and in this case it would be no because
452.88s: I still see primary risk to the downside
455.20s: the linear aggression channels are all
456.52s: negative sloping we see a lot of
458.92s: problems with this to the upside now in
461.36s: the context of a much longer term
463.48s: position what do I think well if I was
465.56s: planning on holding this for over a year
467.52s: this actually starts to look like a
469.00s: value Zone to me you can see how low we
471.44s: are in context and we can see that over
473.56s: the last year it already has been up to
475.52s: nearly 200 from 177 that's a pretty
478.08s: sizable move for something of this price
480.12s: let's move back out to a 2-year daily
482.20s: again if this is like a 5-year
484.20s: hypothesis this does start to look more
486.28s: interesting because again this looks
487.92s: like a value Zone where we're actually
490.16s: starting to move in the correct
491.48s: direction because this is a lower low
493.68s: then a higher low then a slightly higher
496.16s: low higher low higher low so each time
499.12s: that I'm seeing this higher low pop up I
501.16s: become interested because it's obviously
503.16s: trending in the correct direction on a
504.64s: long-term time frame this is exactly why
506.92s: applying different time frames is so
508.48s: important so you can use all of these
510.88s: different tools again in line with
512.88s: whatever it is that you're looking to
514.04s: trade but the whole idea is I'm going to
515.88s: start with an orientation then I'm going
517.64s: to get into Trend and strength actually
519.40s: looking at the individual product and
521.12s: then from there I'm getting into
522.28s: Precision so from here what I'm talking
524.20s: about in terms of precision is what
526.60s: strategy fits the hypothesis I'm looking
528.88s: to trade so again going back to this if
531.36s: I wanted to trade the coverage strangle
532.88s: right now this might be okay for a
535.00s: really long-term trade but for a
536.64s: short-term trade it doesn't look good so
538.56s: that's already telling me that whether
540.36s: I'm going to trade this or not you know
541.96s: that's one question but then if I were
543.48s: to choose a trade I would definitely be
545.20s: trading something longterm not something
547.48s: super shortterm so this allows me after
550.20s: I conduct this analysis to figure out
551.64s: what strategy I'm going to use however
553.52s: again remember sometimes I will come
555.32s: into this already knowing what strategy
557.48s: I want to put on and then filtering for
559.64s: that strategy so the important part here
561.56s: is also understanding that individual
563.20s: strategy you have in your toolkit and
565.32s: what conditions benefit it what hurts it
568.28s: and then finding things that fit that
570.36s: another couple points here when we're
571.76s: talking about the Precision hypothesis
573.60s: is action targets what this means is as
576.24s: iwm is moving around if I come up with
578.24s: some sort of hypothesis actually let's
579.92s: look at a different hypothesis this is a
581.44s: current example I was recently talking
583.44s: about the vix ratio called diagonal that
585.84s: I was establishing because of the
587.80s: contextual understanding that 12 vix is
590.44s: very low and volatility also serves as a
592.92s: good hedge for the broader portfolio
594.60s: yada y y now really important to note
597.12s: that different products behave
598.36s: differently with with different analysis
600.12s: for example the vix doesn't really
602.00s: follow stereotypical technical analysis
604.32s: same thing like if you're trading stuff
606.08s: around earnings it typically is not
608.00s: going to follow your typical technical
609.64s: analysis so different products can
611.40s: behave differently but in this case
613.16s: notice how when I was building the
614.64s: position it was back when vix was below
616.96s: 13 so my hypothesis was vix is going to
619.64s: go up I don't know when but at some
621.36s: point in time so I had a bullish thesis
624.20s: based on an opportunity so then to
626.32s: figure out the right strategy to fit to
628.12s: that I looked at my toolkit and I said
629.92s: well I don't really know when this is
631.56s: going to happen but I have conviction
633.36s: that it would happen at least to see a
635.92s: increase in vix over the next year so
638.16s: that's how I established a ratio called
639.84s: diagonal using long dated options what
642.36s: were my targets how did I expect it to
644.32s: behave I expected it to move around this
646.88s: range and then to have these upticks
649.20s: with pullbacks now why does this all
651.56s: matter because if it starts behaving
653.12s: differently than I'm anticipating I need
655.16s: to update my plan to fit what's actually
657.48s: happening in the landscape because I'm
659.04s: I'm also going to base p&l targets off
661.56s: of the action the expected action so
664.12s: when I'm looking this and I'm saying
665.64s: what are my p&l targets well for the
667.84s: loss side that's pretty easy because vix
670.64s: is so low and vix rarely drops below 12
674.24s: in general so like if we go out super
676.20s: far we go out 5 years daily you can see
678.64s: vix Dro below 12 back in 2019 and it
682.52s: went down to 11 so immediately for me I
685.96s: would look at this and say okay let me
687.84s: draw a spot here that makes sense for
689.80s: the way that this is behaving I'm
691.12s: actually going to erase this one for now
693.00s: and I'll throw in this really long-term
694.76s: one and for me if we trade down at this
697.56s: level essentially sub2 that tells me I'm
699.84s: wrong so I'm setting up my loss not on
702.64s: some random ass percentage but this is a
705.40s: directional thesis so I'm setting up my
707.88s: loss my loss management exactly using a
711.52s: directional thesis so the way I would
713.64s: treat this is perhaps this 12298 this 13
717.04s: handle becomes my initial stop my stop
719.64s: and then if we get down to 1191 that
722.08s: tells me it's time to get out I'm wrong
723.72s: now for the upside if I look at again
726.08s: this is over a yearlong trade and if I
728.48s: look at where we hit kind of like the
730.32s: mid 20s where there was a decent amount
732.56s: of volume Contracting here and we hit a
734.32s: high of 35 I can pick where I think I
736.92s: want to get out at based on a
738.52s: probabilistic range based on the
740.44s: duration of my trade so in this case
742.32s: maybe something around 25 makes sense a
744.52s: lot of the chart was trading above that
746.28s: level so I'm waiting for some sort of
748.12s: pop and volatility that gets me to that
749.68s: time frame or that gets me to that
751.28s: Target within that time frame the other
753.80s: thing is I use the charts and my
756.72s: analysis to help me identify various red
760.08s: flags so what that means is if I think
763.04s: that this is supposed to get up to 25
765.16s: and we consolidate here at 18 for a long
767.56s: time the broader Market News starts
769.48s: looking positive yada yada yada and I
772.04s: have 2 months left in the trade that
773.88s: starts to become a red flag cuz my
775.60s: thesis isn't happening in the correct
777.24s: time frame and I'm up on a decision
778.84s: cycle should I take the trade down at a
780.96s: decent profit given the time that's left
782.88s: or should I leave it on and try to
784.48s: attempt to play out the whole hypothesis
786.44s: you take the blue pill the story ends
789.32s: you wake up in your bed and believe
791.00s: whatever you want to believe you take
792.80s: the red pill you stay in Wonderland and
795.52s: I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes
798.12s: all of this is predetermined before
800.16s: entering the trade now I want to talk to
802.52s: you about some best practices the very
804.84s: first few things less is more this
807.28s: simply means that you don't need to have
809.52s: a million indicators if you remember
811.08s: from the first video I do have several
812.84s: indicators but a lot of them are
814.16s: versions of the same thing and the other
816.00s: thing is they look at very specific
818.20s: things I don't have a lot of duplicates
819.92s: of the same thing it doesn't help me so
822.24s: Simplicity is the ultimate form of
824.48s: sophistication it's a great quote and
826.16s: it's something to integrate into your
827.44s: technical analysis there is no magic
829.48s: this simply means there is no technical
831.64s: indicator that leads to success by
833.64s: itself massive point to get out up front
836.44s: simply because so many people waste so
839.28s: much time looking for this it doesn't
840.80s: exist I'll tell you right now I've spent
842.32s: thousands of hours studying technical
844.52s: analysis indicators and fundamental
846.08s: analysis indicators there's nothing out
847.76s: there so find the things that align with
849.80s: what you're trying to do track them
851.56s: closely which is the third point to
853.72s: evaluate what works what doesn't work
855.72s: and what has the most efficacy for what
857.48s: you're doing next three things when I'm
859.92s: using technical analysis I'm not using
861.72s: it as predictive inputs I'm literally
863.92s: using it to help me understand
865.24s: probabilistic outcomes using that
866.76s: previous example we were just looking at
868.24s: with the Vic it is more probable for the
870.68s: vix to rise above my entry point than to
873.44s: rise below my stop loss I can visualize
876.92s: that probabilistically not only using
878.80s: just the technical analysis I've done
880.32s: based on recent price transactions but I
882.04s: can also use options and the implied
884.72s: volatility to help me to understand
886.12s: ranges the other thing product quirks I
888.24s: kind of talked to you about that but
889.84s: understanding that different rules apply
891.24s: in different times so again volatility
893.32s: products behave very differently than
894.76s: everything else things around a catalyst
896.72s: so things around earnings things around
899.36s: different approvals if you're in biotech
902.32s: things where there's Giant news that
904.36s: comes out that's an injection of brand
906.16s: new information like a CEO was
908.28s: committing fraud for a decade all of
910.08s: those things will have huge impacts on
911.60s: whatever you're using and it's going to
912.88s: violate whatever typical technical
914.68s: analysis you would attempt to apply and
916.36s: that leads into exactly this idea of
918.00s: catalyst and then the last grouping
920.00s: right here is guard rails and scaling so
922.88s: I use technical analysis again to set my
925.44s: p&l targets and then also to help me
927.88s: understand when should I be scaling into
929.80s: or out of different products either for
931.80s: profits or losses the other two things I
933.88s: want to talk about is p&l validation and
936.32s: waiting p&l validation is essentially
939.40s: when we look at whatever we think our
942.20s: tolerable Max losses or what we think
944.92s: our probable Max profit is and to make
947.12s: sure it makes sense against the chart so
949.40s: for example if we look at the vix and
951.76s: let's say that the max loss for a
953.44s: position I have on right now at 12 down
956.44s: here let's say the max loss would be 100
958.68s: $1,000 if I look at that and I say well
961.40s: there's a pretty fair probability that
963.00s: we hit 12 to the downside but I'm super
965.96s: not comfortable with that loss that
967.88s: tells me that there's a discrepancy with
970.32s: my p&l based off of the probabilistic
972.40s: outcomes of the chart you have to you
973.80s: have to rectify those and the last thing
975.60s: is waiting depending on what you're
977.40s: trading it makes a lot of sense to wait
980.04s: different indicators differently and I
982.00s: talked about this in the first video but
983.80s: if you are trading intraday Zer DTE
986.52s: stuff the one-ear chart doesn't matter
988.08s: to you however if you're trading one
989.84s: year stuff the zero DTE chart doesn't
991.88s: matter to you so you have to figure out
993.48s: what it is that you're actually trying
994.72s: to trade and then use the tools that
996.28s: correspond with that time frame so if
998.28s: you have any questions comments concerns
1000.88s: anything that I left out or anything
1002.64s: that you really liked throw it in the
1004.52s: comments below so that I know and I love
1006.68s: chatting with you guys it gives me an
1007.76s: opportunity to connect with you all as
1009.56s: always don't forget to be an outlier
1011.32s: like subscribe share be an outlier see
1013.64s: you'all later
