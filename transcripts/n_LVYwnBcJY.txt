0.00s: What's up, everyone?
1.48s: Quick update on GameStop.
3.92s: Simply because we're at the end of the week,
5.64s: we have earnings coming up and some interesting behavior
9.44s: today.
10.28s: So the last time we spoke, we were talking about how I was
13.88s: really digging that it looks like it's consolidating up
16.64s: kind of in this mid to high 20 handle, which is fantastic.
20.32s: And what I found of interest is I'm keeping a really close
24.36s: eye on the volume.
26.32s: And what I want to detect is how price behaves as volume
31.04s: is moving around.
32.56s: And one of the things I noticed even on today
35.80s: is that it had a very, very low, low open close range, right?
41.04s: It opened at 2788, closed at 2742.
43.80s: So like $1.40 range, really, really small range.
47.80s: But look at the volume.
49.44s: It contracted quite a lot.
51.32s: We've gone from a five day average volume of 11 and 1-half
55.36s: a mill, 20 day average volume of about 12 mill down to 8
59.12s: mill.
59.72s: So volume is contracting.
61.68s: And what I like about this is that even though volume is
65.24s: contracting, it's still hanging up in the 20s.
69.04s: Now, I know a lot of people were hopeful that we would crack
71.48s: above 30.
72.00s: It looked like it was genuinely a potential.
74.44s: But it definitely seems like things slow down a little bit.
78.04s: And today was a little bit of a lighter exploration.
80.88s: We obviously had decent exposure here in 22.
83.96s: But it wasn't crazy.
85.48s: So it was 93,000 options against 15,871.
89.72s: We can see that the bulk of those options
92.04s: were at the 30 if I'm not mistaken.
95.00s: Let's give this a pop up.
97.08s: Yeah, so 30 on the call side, there was 22,600 there.
102.88s: So those didn't stand too much of a chance of falling
108.12s: in the money.
109.20s: We can see that the 28s, we were just shy of that.
112.92s: There was 7,000 there.
114.92s: And then at the 27s, I mean, there was a ton that came in the money.
118.28s: But yeah, the 30s were pretty heavy.
120.92s: And the thing I found interesting is that these were people
123.04s: really bidding into the 30s because there
125.16s: was options added over yesterday into today.
129.72s: So there was a little bit of an expectation of a movement,
132.16s: but it just didn't materialize it looks like.
134.56s: So a couple other things that I want to discuss here
138.52s: is when I look at the overall movement lately in GameStop,
142.80s: I can kind of tell that the overall disposition of traders
147.84s: is moving because we generally will have really, really heavy
152.24s: OI in the front expiration here.
154.96s: It's 136K against 34.
157.12s: This is OI before we're looking at volume.
160.00s: And then if we go to the 29th, that's 92 and 22.
163.20s: The 6th is 33 and 8.
165.40s: 20d is 52 and 25K.
168.96s: The 17th of Jan, 25, look at that 291K against 114.
174.48s: So we're actually playing this a little bit longer term.
177.52s: I want to reiterate that point and it hasn't changed.
180.48s: It's still very much centralized in these near term
183.56s: explorations.
184.92s: We can see that for today, there were quite a few calls
188.44s: that were sold, which makes sense expiration Friday,
190.80s: a lot of the volume that we looked at for today
194.44s: in this front expiration would be trades
197.36s: that are being moved out in time.
199.88s: So like again, like these 30s here,
202.84s: the 23,000 of those that roll through today,
206.68s: those are people that are closing out
208.24s: because the total OI was 24,000.
210.76s: So a lot of those people were closing positions.
213.88s: Some of them obviously opening some stuff,
216.00s: but most of them were closing and moving out.
219.32s: Probably, we'll just take a look.
221.00s: Let's see what the volume looks like for next week
223.72s: if they were just moving out a week.
226.48s: Yes, so 70,000.
228.04s: So that's a pretty significant change
230.76s: where if we look at the open interest
232.96s: that's 92,000 for 29,000.
235.20s: So my guess is people are gonna start getting ready
237.68s: to play some earnings here.
238.88s: Earnings is scheduled for four December.
241.96s: So we'll probably continue to see people
244.52s: running the front month as they tend to.
247.20s: And then as we get closer to earnings,
249.68s: we'll see how active things get.
252.12s: The market right now is pricing pretty significant
255.68s: but not crazy.
257.40s: So 125% and 136% for 6 and 13Ds,
261.80s: which is closer obviously to the earnings release itself.
265.52s: And if we take a peak at its prior earnings,
269.36s: we can see a couple behaviors.
271.88s: So if we look specifically at Q3,
275.20s: it tends to kind of float sideways.
277.64s: We can see that sideways activity here
279.88s: and we can see it look essentially the same back here.
282.76s: So if we're looking at kind of quarterly seasonality
285.72s: for earnings, it looks like Q3 tends to be
288.68s: a little bit more quiet.
290.44s: But we can also see that on the gaps,
293.24s: it's had two gap downs and this one was about a 10% gap down.
298.08s: This one was about the same.
301.40s: And then this one was 26 down to 21.
304.32s: So a little bit more but not excessively more.
307.92s: So overall, it looks like the earnings
311.88s: have been tightening up a little bit.
313.92s: Q2 was softer than I actually expected
317.44s: because they came in at a penny
320.00s: and they were expected at negative a penny.
324.24s: So I thought that there was going to be a little bit more
326.60s: of a positive continuation through there.
328.96s: From a volatility perspective, definitely very, very volatile
332.76s: through earnings we can see,
334.44s: it tends to have risk premiums
336.20s: but they're not really too reliable
338.76s: just because of how emphatically game stop can move.
342.92s: So let's take a quick look at the trades for the week
346.72s: and see what sticks out to us.
348.56s: Because again, there is a couple of things
351.00s: that I think are worth talking about first.
353.60s: Let's grab game stop here.
356.08s: And I want to look at specifically for the week.
360.24s: So overall we can see call premiums,
364.56s: they really jacked up on the 20th into the 21st
370.64s: and then they've really slowed down since.
374.04s: And put premiums have been about steady.
378.68s: So now let's take a quick look at any interesting options trades
383.76s: for this week.
384.52s: So we'll look at the last seven days
387.00s: and active but not excessively so.
392.28s: So a lot of the bigger trades are actually sales
396.36s: and we can still see that most of the trades
398.64s: that are coming through are out in 2025.
403.08s: So this is again, a little bit of that longer term positioning.
406.92s: I would expect the options to get pretty active
410.00s: as we get closer into earnings.
412.16s: It's just a little too early now
413.52s: for people that want to trade earnings specifically
416.08s: to start putting positions on here.
418.44s: So I also will take a quick look at the dark pool
424.28s: and see if there's anything interesting from this week.
427.60s: Let's grab the last seven days
430.00s: and then let's sort these by premium
432.72s: so we get to see the bigger trades.
435.44s: And this looks actually a little quieter than usual.
440.12s: So there's typically over the course of a week,
443.24s: I normally see a little bit more of Mill Plus
448.24s: size trades but I mean, there's still here obviously
451.76s: and it looks like they're really spread across.
456.88s: So the other thing I'm looking for here
458.32s: is in terms of the dates that they occurred.
460.84s: Were there any centralization of the dates,
463.32s: anything that sticks out in terms of like persistent hits
466.76s: or anything like that?
468.08s: I don't really see that.
470.00s: So let's take a quick last look now
472.32s: through a little bit of news.
474.88s: So here we'll grab this little tool down here
479.72s: and then I just wanna flip through some of the recent news
482.52s: and see from a high level perspective.
486.96s: Yeah, so as you guys know,
488.52s: Gensler's stepping down, they're gonna resign
490.40s: on inauguration the 20th of January.
492.52s: So that's awesome.
495.10s: No love loss there and it looks like
499.40s: they're kinda linking just busy stocks, right?
502.12s: So micro strategy and stuff's in here.
504.40s: On the 19th, there was a bit of a highlight
507.16s: on some heavy call activity but nothing
511.16s: that I saw too specific.
513.84s: And then on the 18th, there was a little bit of news.
516.52s: It says, collection holdings, Nat Turner joined the board
519.52s: of Video Game Retail and Original Memes stock.
521.84s: Game stop, I think everybody's, you know,
523.40s: light years aware of this
524.56s: because I also think that he did it for no compensation, right?
527.36s: It says, appointed to the board,
529.08s: Titanig Video Game Retailer,
530.64s: Link to Authentication Management Against,
534.16s: Management Specialist Collector's Holdings.
537.96s: And if I'm not mistaken, let me double check that really quick.
542.04s: Yeah, so grabbing this here, it looks like,
546.32s: it looks like he's not, which is great.
549.48s: So now they have six board members.
556.56s: Interesting.
558.36s: I wonder how far they're going to go down this collectible path.
561.08s: Yeah, because this is obviously happening
563.24s: where Game Stop is moving beyond video games.
565.20s: We knew that was going to happen.
566.16s: They're sitting on a lot of money to do this.
568.36s: I still think that there's a bigger play
572.12s: underneath the surface here.
573.40s: I don't know exactly where it is
575.00s: or when they're talking about it.
576.68s: But like this feels like a safe,
578.96s: close to home style move with grading.
581.68s: And I wonder, yeah, I'm really eager for this next earnings
585.76s: to see if we hear anything that indicates
588.80s: what direction they might be taking stuff.
590.84s: But yeah, overall Game Stop is most importantly impressing me
596.28s: with its ability to hang out in the high 20s.
598.96s: I want to see that continue.
600.60s: If there's anything that you think I should take a look at,
602.60s: let me know in the comments.
603.72s: Be an outlier.
604.56s: I'll see you all later.
