0.00s: Hey everybody, Eric here and I am super stoked to have Brian on from Alpha Trends. So first off welcome to the channel.
10.00s: Thanks for having me on here, Eric.
12.00s: And just so you know whenever you see me looking down, I got a little notepad here because I am partially an idiot and I forget things. So I like to write stuff down.
22.00s: But the reason why I came across you first of all is there's a couple people that I interact with regularly on Twitter and one of which is Jake from Transpiter.
34.00s: As soon as you start talking technical analysis, your name inevitably comes up in that web.
40.00s: And I also wanted to say very quickly, thank you for sending me a copy of your book.
45.00s: I have literally been enjoying reading that a lot. I have actually quite a few questions on that that I'll get to in a little bit.
52.00s: But I want to start with a little bit of level setting with you because the way that my channel is set up is.
59.00s: And I think that financial industry in general has a lot of in authenticity.
65.00s: And one of the things that I've always really benefited from when I was starting trading and whatnot is I had a mentor that just spent some time with me and kind of just shot it to me straight.
77.00s: And I learned a little bit about technical analysis, but one of the things that I'm known for on my channel is generally a lack thereof.
87.00s: So I thought what better person to connect with because one of my favorite things to do on the channel is to tie into different skill sets and obviously you have a very technical skill set.
98.00s: And I think that exploring that a little bit offers a really, really cool paradigm to the rest of the audience because like I said, for me, I use some and I'll get into a little bit of what I like to do, but I'm more interested in what you like to do.
112.00s: I thought a great way to start would be if you don't mind, I would love to just get an understanding of your relationship with the markets kind of at large.
123.00s: So maybe when you started in the markets and what that evolved into over time.
128.00s: I started in the markets at an early age, I think I was 12 or 13 and just kind of used to hang out with my dad on Friday nights back when Wall Street week was a big thing with Lewis Ruqaizer, I don't know if you know that name, Eric.
143.00s: It was a Friday night show and I would, you know, was the kid who wanted to hang out with his dad.
148.00s: I would sit there and watch TV with him and he'd always have Wall Street week on on Fridays. I was kind of his thing.
154.00s: So I, you know, they, and they talked about the market. So I started, you know, asking questions here and there once in a while.
162.00s: And then there was a company in the Boston area where I grew up at the time, called Lo Jack and they had just gotten a contract with the state police and.
173.00s: And he just, I saw it on TV and basically got lucky. I said to my dad, hey, you know, can we buy some of this stock and it was, you know, $5 a share.
182.00s: He said, sure, I'll put up, you know, I had money from caddy, newspaper roots and all that stuff you do is a kid to make money.
189.00s: And he said, well, we'll buy a thousand shares and, you know, he gave me leverage basically.
195.00s: And then he said, well, I'm going to buy a couple months later, the stock went to $10 per share.
201.00s: And I had a thousand shares of it and I was like, oh, team 14 years old. So, you know, I thought, hey, why does anyone work?
209.00s: This is, this is the way to go. I'm going to, that's what I want to do is be a trader.
214.00s: It wasn't, it wasn't as easy as it seemed from that trade. There's been a lot of up and up and downs, you know, in between that got me where I am today.
223.00s: That was just my first introductory, you know, kind of got the needle in the arm for a lack of better analogy.
233.00s: But I mean, it's true. I was hooked and I really, you know, so I, you know, later on when I was at, you know, 16, 17, I kept my interest in the market.
243.00s: We go to the library and read, you know, newsletters and that sort of thing. When was the cabinet market letter?
249.00s: There was value line there. And I would, you know, look at these things and dream of all the money I was going to make.
255.00s: And I between reading mafia books was, I like to read those in stock market books. So as a kid.
262.00s: Unfortunately, I'm a trader, not a mafia guy.
265.00s: Good career choice.
267.00s: Right. Those guys are in jail or dead. So.
270.00s: Yeah. So, so that really was, you know, it called to me. And so I went on to become a retail stock broker in Boston.
280.00s: And, you know, as I like to tell people, it was basically a glorified telemarketing position. I really, I didn't know what a broker did.
288.00s: I went to college. I didn't take college seriously as I should have. I was a solid C student, basically. And not really.
295.00s: Then I'd think of my injuries just to get an agree.
297.00s: You know, I have mixed feelings about what I had a better time in school or life afterwards. And I think I made the right call just.
310.00s: You know, finding the balance.
313.00s: Although, you know, I think a better balance would have been these and the little less of the weekend activities.
319.00s: But, um, the drifted into the weekdays.
321.00s: serious topics. So the retail stockbroker was basically a telemarketing position. It wasn't
329.64s: what I wanted to do. It was really good that I learned a lot of skills, sales skills, dealing
337.08s: with people, being a retail broker. So, and I care around when I say it, but it's honestly
345.72s: partially true that I got to practice with other people's money and make mistakes with
350.60s: their money before I went and became a full-time trader myself, which was 1993. So 91
361.32s: I graduated college and went to work at Lehman Brothers, moved out to Denver, worked for a company
366.44s: called Dane Bosworth. And I think it was 93 I went and became a full-time trader. I opened my
371.24s: own office, actually day trading office in Denver with a partner. And kind of had that office for
377.96s: a little while. I ran a hedge fund for a little bit, which never really amounted to a lot.
383.32s: I just was not it didn't have the asset base and I was a little impatient. So, you know, I started
391.32s: with another company called Marketwise where I created stock, you know, stock trading courses,
397.48s: you know, technical analysis and, you know, just about level two and, you know, trading in general.
403.24s: And then, you know, left them about 14 years ago. I started, you know, I've been trading full-time
411.88s: and just trading and then how would Linson over who started stock tweets approach me once and said,
417.72s: hey, do you want to start a newsletter? You've got a good YouTube following and that sort of thing,
422.76s: you know, and you've got good information. Do you want to start a newsletter? Yeah, but I don't
426.12s: feel like dealing with all the, you know, customer service stuff. So, he said, don't worry about it.
433.08s: We'll handle that for you. So, alpha trends was born out of that as, you know, subscription product.
439.32s: And I still do it to this day. I don't market it heavily or anything like that. I kind of let
444.84s: people organically find me and, you know, if it fits, if it's not, then I'm not going to beat anyone
450.44s: over the head for it. I'm not in the sales. You know, my passion is the market. And if you,
455.72s: if you follow me on Twitter, you see that's, you know, basically my, it continues to be my passion.
461.56s: Now, it hasn't always been, you know, the, it's a love-hate relationship. And, you know, the,
468.44s: the more, the more experience you get in the market, the more it's a love experience because you
472.76s: realize that you can deal with the market on your own terms. You don't have to chase things.
477.80s: It's okay to miss trades. You just become more patient, more tolerant of market moves.
485.08s: You know, my wife likes to say it's, you know, life's too short to drink bad wine. And life's
492.20s: too short to take marginal trades as well. You know, there's just no longer, do I sit there and just
498.68s: Jones for trades and look to take a trade because I feel like, hey, I'm a trader, I have to trade
504.36s: something. Where's the action? Instead, it's, it's just more methodical, you know, process-based,
511.24s: focused rather and, you know, managing risk is the most important thing.
516.52s: I, I don't know how you read my mind. I literally was just writing down some notes from your book
523.56s: and the very first bullet point. I literally just wrote this was risk management because
527.72s: I love that you talk about that in your book. And it's something that my mentor spent a lot of time
534.36s: explaining to me because you have people like Warren Buffett that has his rules and is, you know,
539.72s: first rule is make money, second rule, don't forget room number one. And, you know, he always
544.44s: respectfully disagreed with that for the purpose of traders. Obviously Warren Buffett, more of an
549.56s: investor mindset. And he always instilled in me that the number one job of any active market
558.28s: participant is risk management that's your, you know, very first thing. And I actually love that
563.56s: you talked about that very early in the book because one of the things that I think about technical
568.68s: analysis is a lot of folks either are non-committal in their forecasts or they always have a reason why,
575.88s: you know, the forecast didn't work or something like that. And it just, it, to me, it feels like it
581.48s: misses an element of reality. And the fact that your book started with that really set me on the
588.36s: right tone in my mind for reading the rest of the book because I think the fact that you talk
594.60s: about that early is super important to me as a trader. And obviously I think that that's a great
601.24s: highlight for a lot of folks that are interested in the market, whether it's VATA, you know, investing
606.84s: or whatever. I had a couple questions about your kind of career progression. I always,
613.80s: this is kind of a selfish part of these conversations because I literally am just very curious about
619.96s: people. It's your conversation. You get to call the shots, right? Well, I always, I try to make
624.92s: sure that I integrate, you know, because I get questions that some, you know, the folks send in
629.40s: that they want me to go over with you and whatnot, but I always make sure to add a little selfish
633.48s: time in there because some of this stuff is really cool to me because so for me, I started trading
638.36s: when I was in high school and I started with, you know, buying and selling stock, but essentially,
645.08s: I've been retail trader side the whole time. Right. So when I talk to people like you that have had
650.04s: some mixed experience, I find that fascinating to explore some of that. So one of the, the first
656.36s: questions I wanted to ask you is when you went from your time from working as a retail stock broker
663.80s: and then you opened that day trading office, what, what was that transition like for you? Like when
670.84s: you were retail stock broker, obviously, very focused on sales and getting people, you know, to,
675.72s: to place trades and whatnot. And then I'm assuming when you went to that day trading office,
679.96s: probably a different focus. I'm curious just a little bit about what that looked like for you.
684.12s: Right. So it wasn't straight to my own office. But I didn't clarify that earlier. What happened was I had
693.56s: used to read the, the, get the news, the print IBD. And in the back page, there was always an
699.00s: advertisement there that said, you know, day trade by power, you know, get 20 to one leverage.
704.68s: Right. They put 25,000 dollars down and you get 20 to one leverage. So that appealed to me. I was
711.08s: thinking, you know, I don't have enough money to trade full time. You've got to thank this was
715.00s: 1993. And I was 20, I guess, 20, 21, 22 years old. Is that right? The 20, 26, whatever it was.
728.20s: But the point is that, you know, I had a young family. I had a mortgage. My wife wasn't working.
732.92s: And I had about, oh, so you already had a family at that time. I did. Yeah. Yeah. So the pressure,
739.48s: so the pressure is on the pressure was on for maybe there was something in my brain that wasn't
745.32s: connected to recognize the magnitude of the risk because because what I'm going to tell you next,
752.20s: I wouldn't suggest anyone do. I had this job as a broker and I had saved up maybe about 19,000
759.64s: dollars. And I was just couldn't wait to get out of there once I had my 25,000 dollars. And
766.44s: this was about this time of year around Christmas. And I guess it was 1993. And I was training this
774.04s: stock called chantel pharmaceuticals. And chantel pharmaceuticals wasn't a pharmaceutical company
780.36s: at all. It was a, it was a skin cream that had this miraculous anti-wrinkle property. Nice. And
788.12s: I had all these doctors, you know, that came on the payroll and, you know, made it seem like a
793.32s: legitimate story. So you know where this company's going by those words. So I had run my account from,
800.28s: you know, $19,000 to $28,000 in a two week period. I was like, that's it. I'm ready to quit. I'm
809.16s: done. You know, I'm going to, I'm going to go. So I then took a day off work to go skiing. I
817.00s: called the office to see where chantel was. This was a Monday. I took the Monday off. And the
823.88s: person who answered the phone, you know, I had a thousand shares of this thing. It was let's say
828.44s: $23 a share. And she says it's $18.50. I was like, no, no, no, you get to symbol wrong. It should
835.56s: be, it's probably like 28 by now. It does nothing but go up. Anyways, Barons did a hit piece over
843.08s: on it over the weekend and basically said, you know, the company's a fraud. This thing doesn't do
848.36s: anything for wrinkles. So I just said, listen, sell my stock right here right now, which was the
854.04s: right thing to do because it ended up, it was a fraud. And I was lucky to get out $15 a share when
860.20s: it, you know, I mean, within six months, it was a $2 stock. What was your basis? You know, I had been
865.56s: trading it. So I considered my basis, basically, we're closed on Friday, which might have been $23
874.20s: per cent. So I'd lost $8,000. So it brought me back under that $25,000 level. And, you know,
881.80s: I was crushed. So I had already put in my notice that I was quitting. And I didn't know what to do.
890.36s: So I took a cash advance on my credit card to make up the difference. I wired it into New York
899.08s: and started trading. And, you know, I was scared to death really losing any money. And they say
906.76s: scared money never wins. And scared money doesn't win big. But I was able to, you know, plug away.
912.60s: And I wasn't making real money at all. I mean, I was like making $18,000 this month, $26,000,
919.72s: but I was making me, I had a really, I mean, my first house cost, I think was $79,000. So my
927.16s: mortgage was like less than $9,000. So it was, you know, it worked. But I realized I'm never going
936.44s: to get ahead with this, even with this leverage because one big mistake, I'm just done. I'm not
942.76s: going out of the water. I've got, you know, got to go back up plan. Right. And you got the family now.
947.40s: That, that, that part to me is just, I really tip my hat off to you because that's, no, I get,
954.36s: you know, like looking back, it's kind of like, was that right? But just to make that bold of a move,
960.76s: I think deserves some sort of recognition because I feel like at some point you have to trust
965.64s: yourself. And you got there a lot earlier than I did. Like that's, that's nuts to me. That's
970.52s: awesome. It is nuts. And that, that, you know, it worked. Fortunately, I can laugh about it. And
975.96s: I wouldn't suggest anyone does it. And I had a very strong, that's why risk management,
981.48s: Eric is so important to me. I've been on the, I've been on the brink of disaster. And I've,
987.96s: I've had, you know, bad drawdowns in between, obviously, in my 30 year career. But it never
995.48s: bad enough to put me out of business. And, and I, I feel like a lot of people out there are
1001.16s: putting themselves in positions where they just trust the market game to do nothing but go up
1005.88s: and everything comes back. And they would never cut a loser. What, what, you know, the,
1010.20s: what, how, how, with that work, they, it's just not a part of some people's process. Anyway,
1016.68s: so, you know, the company that I worked for, they were called generic trading. And I was trading
1021.32s: remotely on it, it was on a 24 K modem. And then I remember the upgrade of the 48 K modem was
1028.36s: just amazing. And then, so I, I, I went to New York and talked to the, the, the owners of it,
1036.92s: Ron Sheer and my rough minutes, it listened, you know, there's nothing like this in Denver,
1041.00s: would you want to back an office in Denver? And they did. So I, you know, got my branch managers
1047.56s: license open in office, ran it for a couple of years, merged it with another company, and,
1054.92s: worked with them. That was market wise, was the name of the company for a period of, I think,
1059.64s: about eight or nine years. And that kind of just, you know, ran its course. And fast forward to,
1069.96s: just sitting down, trading for myself, writing notes and doing, you know, YouTube videos for free
1077.08s: with no intent of, of doing anything with it. And then like I said, Howard approached me and said,
1083.24s: hey, you want to start newsletter. So I, that, that, that was that. Right, right.
1089.08s: That, that is just so crazy to me. The other thing that I find fascinating about these
1092.68s: conversations is, you know, I, I have been trading for a little while, right? I've been trading for
1097.88s: over 14 years now. Yeah. But to talk to people like you that have like no kidding, like you talking
1104.12s: about the modems is what just inserted this in my brain. You know, it's like, people like you
1108.60s: have like just this very fascinating perspective about the evolution of the markets, which is another
1115.80s: question that I'm going to ask in a little bit. But I have another, another background question to
1124.04s: ask you. And what I'm curious about is, so you did this day trading bit for a while and you're
1129.96s: kind of explaining how you ended up moving over to the, the hedge fund and managing a fund for a
1135.80s: little while. And you were mentioning that that wasn't necessarily your, your, um, and all be all.
1142.52s: But I am curious. While you were managing the hedge funds, I'm assuming you had a very different
1150.44s: strategy that you were generally deploying compared to when you're trading like now as an individual
1155.48s: retail trader. Is that true or no? Not really. I mean, so it was, you know, I started out kind of
1161.72s: just day trading. This was actually, I remember this was during the SOS period as well. SOS was
1167.24s: still the way you executed orders. Right. And then they started coming out with the ECNs. The first,
1172.84s: you know, real big one was, was Island and then ready and archipelago. And those gave the retail
1179.80s: trader the ability to get in between the spreads that back then were, you know, quarters and eighths.
1185.72s: They, you know, they were debt, they were fractions, not decimals. So those gave us a perceived
1192.60s: advantage. And if you look at it now, you'd be like, well, why is there a 25 cent spread in the
1197.72s: stock? This is insane. Right. You know, we're used to pennies now. So that kind of, you know,
1204.92s: progressed towards, you know, an evolution of my style. Okay. That the, that the SOS, the speed of
1213.00s: SOS wasn't so important anymore. One of the most influential books early on was Hit and Run
1220.68s: Trading by Jeff Cooper. And there were some strategies in there that I learned that really helped me
1227.48s: kind of see the market for more for swing trades. And I started expanding my time frame into,
1235.00s: you know, instead of just being a day trader, days and sometimes weeks. And, you know, learning
1242.12s: to put my thoughts of what the company does, you know, I was trained as a broker that, you know,
1247.40s: fortunately for me, the, when I worked at Lehman Brothers, I had a senior broker I worked under,
1252.60s: and he was in the technical analysis. So I picked up a lot from him. And the way that he would pit
1257.56s: stocks was he would find earning surprises. But it had to have a good chart. If it didn't have a
1262.76s: good chart, forget about it. And then we would, then I would kind of have to, you know, help develop a
1268.04s: story to sell to a customer because a customer isn't going to buy a stock because it's breaking out
1273.80s: on huge volume. And, you know, the things that we take for granted now instead it would have to be,
1279.96s: hey, you know, they make this product, their sales are this, the earnings are that, estimates are
1284.28s: going up, you know, value lines says this, our analyst says that. And creating, you know, the pitch,
1292.28s: creating the story around it. Quick question on that. Yeah. We're most of the people that you were
1297.48s: pitching to, were they more investors, where they were like holding for longer than a year, or
1302.36s: were you guys managing folks that were actively buying and selling, you know, more frequently than that?
1307.88s: Well, you tend to find the people that you that are geared towards your personality. So if I pick,
1316.04s: if I, if I pitch somebody on the phone, who is buying a hold investor, and I'm talking to them
1323.08s: about, you know, this, we think this is our three to six month target is the way we generally,
1329.24s: you know, mention them, or three to six month target is this. They say, well, that doesn't interest me.
1334.36s: Then, you know, they need to figure out, you know, and one of the nice, one of the nice, I guess,
1339.56s: one of the things that I learned at Lehman was that a successful phone call is either you get a
1344.76s: yes, or they hang up on you. And I didn't really want them to hang up on me, but it was, yeah,
1350.28s: I'd get pretty firm nose. You'd have to just keep going back at them, back at them, back at them,
1355.00s: until they really became clear. No, this is not what I do. Okay, fine. Thanks. So you would, you know,
1361.88s: your, your customers would kind of be representative of this, the style that you presented them. Okay.
1369.80s: And, you know, a better salesman would probably try to be all things to all people and pretend,
1377.64s: hey, well, yeah, we'll hold it longer term. But I was more interested in the market than I was
1382.60s: in being in sales. So I gave it to him straight. Here's what we're looking for. And that was,
1389.40s: you know, if I had to do it the other way, in fact, you know, one of the, one of the firms that sponsored
1396.44s: me as, as a broker, they wanted me selling sure as products. And I said, listen, I have no
1403.88s: interest in selling sure. I'm not going to sell annuities. And I said, no, you have to sell annuities.
1410.20s: You, you, I've scheduled you to take your test, you know, in, in a month. So I'm not going to study
1415.24s: for the test. We'll see how it goes. And I failed the test. So because I was stubborn, I'm 22,
1420.20s: old, and I already know everything. So why would I want to do this? Yep. But the point is I, you know,
1426.36s: I was a stock guy. And I'm not going to, I couldn't authentically sell annuities to someone.
1431.88s: That's awesome. So he signed me up to take the test again. I studied for an hour and failed it.
1436.68s: Third time he said, listen, you really don't want to do this. Do you? I was like, hey, finally got
1440.12s: the hint. Quick bugging me. No, we're selling stocks. I'm a stock worker, not an insurance agent.
1447.48s: So that was just a little aside there. That's awesome. Though I'm glad because there's so
1451.08s: many people, especially when you realize what you can make on insurance products via commissions,
1456.76s: a lot of people are like, yes, you know, sign me up. But it's like you're saying they kind of sell
1462.20s: their souls in pursuit of a few dollars. And I actually really respect the fact that, you know,
1467.72s: they dangled money essentially in front of your face. And you're like, no, it's not what I like to do.
1471.08s: I'm going to keep doing that. So I, like, I love that. I think that's a little cool. Thanks.
1475.48s: So then you were talking a little bit about the broker that you worked under. And he was starting
1484.76s: to introduce or I don't make maybe you were already familiar with technical analysis at that point.
1489.48s: But that's really what I want to understand next is when did you find technical analysis? And when
1495.00s: did that become the thing that appealed to you? The summer of 1991 when I graduated college,
1503.16s: as I used to look at these newsletters and there was one newsletter. It was the Cabot Market
1508.92s: Letter. And in that they said they were talking about this company that, you know, it was called
1514.84s: Advanced Polymers. And it was, you know, things that go into tube products that make it last longer.
1521.56s: The flavor last longer in gum or in toothpaste, it will hold things better. It was a polymer that
1527.96s: you know, binded them together was the story behind it. It had a great story. And the, I remember
1534.52s: reading, you know, we like this stock if it gets above $8 per share or whatever the price was.
1540.84s: I was like, why would you want to buy it higher? That doesn't make any sense. You know,
1545.00s: why not buy it at this low point? And then I looked at a chart and it was just clear as day.
1551.16s: I mean, the chart just spoke to me that it just kept coming up to that $8 level. We couldn't
1555.48s: get past it. So yeah, it can't get past eight. Well, if it gets above eight, well, there's clear
1560.52s: sky. And then I started to say, okay, I need to learn about this technical analysis stuff. So
1567.48s: that somewhere I picked up the first book I picked up was by John Murphy, technical analysis of
1574.44s: the future's market, which you know, it applies to stocks. Then I read the better book, which
1580.52s: really has had the huge impact, which was Stan Weinstein Secrets for Profiting the Bull of Bear
1585.48s: Markets. And that one, you know, I devoured that book and that one just spoke to me big time.
1591.24s: So I had a little bit of knowledge going into that role under the senior broker. I was basically,
1599.24s: I was getting paid five bucks an hour for qualifying leads. And then if I opened the account,
1605.72s: at least a $10,000 account, I would get a hundred bucks. And so I was making peanuts. But I was
1611.88s: getting great experience because I was working for a guy who was, you know, he was a million dollar
1615.80s: producer, you know, a million dollars of commissions a year. So he was top notch. And I learned a lot
1621.00s: there. I didn't stick around long because I wanted to go be a broker somewhere else and rush the
1626.68s: prize in a hurry, which worked out great. So he was, you know, he would get the daily graphs,
1637.00s: which is Marcus Smith now. Daily graphs had printed products called, what they were called daily
1643.08s: graphs. And there were printed books. One was the blue book, which was the New York Stock Exchange
1649.00s: and the green was the NASDAQ and AMEX. And it was, you know, it would come every weekend,
1656.20s: 200 pages, four charts per page. It had, you know, all the information of sales and earnings.
1661.88s: And I would just spend, you know, all day Sunday, as soon as I got those, I would just spend hours
1667.00s: going through them. And then, you know, they were four per page. I would cut them out, cut out the
1671.64s: ones I liked that were interesting. I'd go down to kinkos and put it on 400% and make it a, you know,
1678.44s: full-size page so I could stay and mark notes on it and get ready for the week ahead.
1684.44s: So that, it really just, I mean, it just spoke to me and it made so much sense because
1690.92s: I knew when I was a broker, I was selling the chart. But I had to, you know,
1697.88s: that's what I was selling, but I had to package it with a story. I had to put some sizzle in it
1704.04s: because people would be like, right, like, look, I've brought past this resistance on heavy volume.
1709.16s: You lose them as soon as you say that. Right.
1711.40s: It's different today because technical analysis is much wider known and accepted and seen everywhere
1718.20s: these days. Yeah, yeah, definitely. And but I think that that also, I don't know if it was
1724.84s: purposeful for you or maybe subconsciously, but even as you're talking about a lot of this
1729.32s: technical analysis that you were doing, maybe, you know, you were doing some of this
1733.56s: fundamental research to support it. But I mean, you're telling me about these different companies
1738.92s: and like, you know what they produced, you know, what it was supposed to, you know, what value
1742.68s: was supposed to provide. So it even seems like, you know, you might focus more heavily on technical
1747.64s: analysis, but it does seem like there's still, you know, a bit of qualitative understanding that
1752.60s: you used, you know, to like bundle this whole thing up, which I think is really interesting.
1758.28s: Do you think that that's something that you still do today? Like when you're trading whatever you
1762.60s: like to trade, do you still have that level of fundamental understanding as well and you're kind
1768.36s: of driving with technical analysis? Or would you say that you're kind of like more of a pure
1772.92s: technical analyst? Yeah, you know, I don't look at, you know, I sometimes I'll look at a company's
1778.92s: website if I just want to see what their product, you know, physically actually is. But most of the
1785.16s: time I'm familiar with what the company does. I mean, I'll look in, I'll read the paragraph
1790.76s: description. I'll look at their, you know, and that's a nice thing about market Smith charts is that
1796.92s: they have what I think are the most important things. The two most important things are whatever the
1802.52s: company is, are they increasing revenues, whatever they sell, are they selling more of that stuff
1808.20s: than they did in the same quarter a year ago? And is that increasing sequentially as well? First
1814.68s: quarters, you know, second and third, fourth quarter. And not only are they, you know, increased
1820.20s: revenues, but is it showing up in the bottom line? Or they're making more money? Now they're selling
1824.68s: more stuff, are they making more money selling that stuff? That's basically what I need to know
1831.00s: about the company. And then if the chart supports it, it gives me that little extra confidence that
1838.84s: I can go into this stock a little bit heavier because they have a real product, they have a real
1843.00s: company. It's not some fly-by-night little biotech stock that is in phase two, you know, and it's got
1849.88s: this wild chart that, you know, it can go up 80% on a day, but if you look at the, you know, every single
1856.84s: day, if you look at the NASDAQ losers, you know, in the top 10, there's two or three little biotech stocks
1862.52s: that are down 30%, 40%. So it just gives me a little bit of confidence to say, hey, it's a real company,
1870.84s: and I understand the psychology of what drives fundamental investors. I'm not necessarily buying
1876.76s: the story myself, but I understand that the market values these things, and they do have a real
1883.24s: product. So it makes sense that I can get involved a little bit heavier, you know, in terms of my
1889.40s: risk unit, and give me the confidence to hold overnight. And then I want to know what earnings do
1896.52s: over, you know, tonight, if so, I don't want to hold it, or if they're doing a week, maybe I buy it
1901.56s: for the run-up in front of earnings, and just basic fundamentals, Eric. That honestly, like, I feel like
1908.68s: that's, that came across in your book, and that was something that I really liked, because
1916.60s: a big frustration that I have is a lot of, I think retail traders in general face in uphill
1923.72s: battle, no matter what. I mean, even down to, you know, what we can transact at, we can get to,
1930.44s: you know, two decimals, whereas market makers go to four to sit, you know, dependent on where they're at,
1934.76s: because there's just a lot of structural, you know, barriers that we already have to deal with.
1941.96s: And something very frustrating narrative I see is when people are like, oh, you know, this is
1947.72s: better than that, speaking fundamental better than technical, technical, better than fundamental.
1952.28s: Right. And I've always been a huge advocate of why pick, that it's not a binary decision. You can
1960.44s: exactly like you're saying, you can use both. Do you need to, you know, wait them exactly the same
1965.16s: no, you know, you do what you're comfortable with, but I love that you integrate some, you know,
1970.92s: other parts, no matter what that is. And I think that this is a powerful message for people, because
1975.40s: a lot of folks, you know, might be charts, but even like you said, understanding what the company
1980.68s: sells just helps provide a little bit of context. Yeah. And that leads to a follow on question. And
1985.96s: this is just a general curiosity. If you came across a chart that you really liked, but the company's
1994.20s: description, they sold something that you just don't believe in or that, you know, you didn't really
1999.16s: think much of, how do you treat those instances? I'm in the market to make money not save my soul,
2008.28s: or, or, you know, win points with any investing committee or, uh, big judge, you know, the market
2016.76s: to selfish endeavor, I can, I can go beyond that pretty quickly. You know, unless it's something
2023.40s: egregious that just, just doesn't make sense to me. And I honestly can't think of an example.
2029.16s: I, you know, you're so called sin stocks, you know, sell guns, they sell weed, they sell booze,
2035.24s: uh, doesn't, doesn't bother me. You know, there's, there's products for these, they're partner
2040.44s: society. The stock is going, I see it, you know, right. Why wouldn't I get involved? Right. I love that.
2049.00s: That's, I truly identified with the same thing. I went through an interesting phase. I was trading,
2055.48s: like a couple company, like, Philip 66. And I was trading, you know, just some stuff that falls
2061.80s: close to those categories. And I was like, thinking through how I felt about it, but I pretty much
2066.36s: arrived at the same conclusion a while ago, whereas there's a market for it. People make their own
2070.04s: choices. This looks good at the time. I'm gonna, gonna trade it. Right. Yeah. Um, cool. So that's
2078.36s: really helpful to understand a bit of just your general context. Um, like I said, I think that
2084.28s: you bring a really fun perspective, um, to really to the discussion because it's, it's fascinating
2091.88s: for me to understand more about your, um, your approach. So I want to pivot real quick to just
2098.92s: a little bit more about your general technical analysis approach. So there's a couple things that I
2105.88s: picked up in the book that really just seemed to cross through to me, one of which was the,
2111.80s: the concept of multiple time frames. Um, so if there was like a 30,000 foot view summary,
2120.60s: if you were to characterize your general approach to technical analysis, what does that look like?
2126.20s: Yeah. So I mean, you hit it. It's trend alignment. And what that basically means is, you know,
2131.32s: at any given day in the market, you know, we could be in a bullish environment or a bearish
2137.32s: environment. We, I mean, we've had off of the COVID low in 2020, we've had this phenomenal bull
2143.96s: market. But along the way, there's been a couple scary declines. And, you know, periods of, let's say,
2150.36s: three to six weeks where we've clearly been in bearish environments. And if you're buying stocks,
2156.28s: you know, it's, you're losing money or if you're buying some of these stocks that are yesterday's
2161.48s: winners, Peloton, you know, Zoom, PayPal, you know, the list goes on and on. A lot of these big
2168.36s: tech names have been destroyed here in just the last few months. So when I look at those,
2175.56s: I look at the big picture and say, Hey, it's, it's in a primary uptrend. So to me, that becomes
2181.96s: a candidate for, for purchase. I don't want to buy it after a stock has already made a move or
2188.84s: phomo move, you know, fear of missing out. Hey, it's run. I got to get on board. And one of the things
2193.72s: that really is curious is that whenever I, you know, interact on one of these Twitter spaces or if I
2201.64s: do a webinar with people who are asking questions about a stock, they almost always ask me mainly about
2209.08s: two types of stocks. One, the stock that's up 10, 15% in the last week. Do you think this is a good
2216.28s: buy here? Look where it's come from. Or they ask about Peloton and zoom and say, does it look like
2223.48s: a good buy down here? And they've been trained by the dip, but they bought the dip at 10% down, 20%,
2231.72s: 30%, 40% and here we are 60% down. Dip buying is not a strategy in my mind. So what we want to do is
2240.76s: buy strength after a dip. A true dip is a stock in an uptrend that pulls back to a level fine
2249.64s: support and resumes that uptrend. If instead the stock pulls back, breaks below key support, breaks
2256.92s: below moving averages, those moving averages start to roll over, tells me we're in a different phase
2263.00s: for this stock. The sellers of regain control, it's no longer dip buying. You're buying into the abyss.
2269.64s: You're buying from institutions who are set liquidating millions of shares and thinking, you know,
2277.08s: that it's yesterday's news and using yesterday's logic that the stock is in an uptrend and the
2283.88s: bounces have been strong with today's reality that it's a broken stock. So what I want to do is I
2291.32s: want to focus on the stocks that are in uptrends. And real simple, I mean, if you look at a daily
2296.68s: timeframe, you could look at a 20 and a 50 day moving average. If the 20 day moving average is
2301.80s: above the 50 and they're both rising, to me, it's an uptrend. It's innocent till proven guilty.
2307.88s: But it doesn't mean I can just buy it anywhere. Again, it might have just run 15% in the last three
2312.76s: days. I don't want to be late because a normal pullback from normal correction could shake me out
2318.84s: at a big loss. Instead, I want to see the stock that ran up 15% with sideways for a day or two.
2326.52s: And then begins to pull back three or four days. And it maybe retraces half of that rally that it showed.
2334.76s: I don't want to buy it as it's pulling back because again, I don't know if this is the time it's
2339.08s: going to catch a collapse. Yeah. So as we start to look at shorter term timeframes, and you might
2345.88s: look at, for instance, a 30 minute timeframe of the last 30 days, you'll see that it's come down
2351.72s: and it starts to turn sideways. And as it starts to turn sideways and stabilize, it might be
2357.16s: stabilizing on that 20 day moving average or at a 61.8% retracement or at a volume weighted
2363.40s: average price from the prior low. If there's some technical reason to be interested there,
2369.48s: then I'm aware of it. And I look at the shorter term time frame and I look at and say,
2374.84s: okay, it looks like the battle is being waged here between the buyers and sellers. But the sellers
2380.04s: have taken control for a few days. Now it's turning sideways. If we go back to technical analysis 101,
2387.96s: the first rule is, you know, one of the first rules is trying to once established is more likely
2393.00s: to continue than reverse. So if it paused and as soon as it starts to make that first little higher
2400.12s: high on the shorter term time frame, it emerges out of the price correction and then a time correction.
2406.84s: It makes that first higher high on the shorter term time frame. It's now an alignment with the higher
2412.60s: high, the higher highs and higher lows on the daily time frame. That's where I want to get involved
2418.20s: and set my stop underneath whatever the most recent relevant higher low is. So if you look at my
2424.60s: Twitter, I never mentioned stocks without saying, here's where a worst case stop would go.
2431.32s: It's always again, back to what you picked up on, you know, first thing you said is, it's always
2436.20s: about risk management. You can't get hung up in your analysis and say, I'm going to, I think I'm
2442.68s: right. Forget the market. I'm going to buy more. You have to say, at this point, the, you know, if
2449.08s: if the first point it makes that first higher high on the short term time frame after the pullback,
2455.40s: that's where the momentum is now an alignment with longer term time frame. Now I'm looking at an
2461.00s: merging trend defined by higher highs and higher lows. So if instead it breaks higher and then
2468.28s: pulls back and makes a lower low, well, my definition of trend is no longer existing. So why on
2474.68s: earth would I still want to hold the stock? Because I'm stubborn because I read the annual report and
2479.72s: I spent 10 hours researching this stock on the weekend and I feel like I have to make money in it.
2485.48s: That's part of the danger of doing two in depth of the fundamental research you start to
2490.60s: feel married to it. Yep. Yeah. I think that that's so that's something that I talk quite a bit
2496.12s: about too is it was funny when I I don't know it was trading for a little while early on. I would
2502.68s: see these people talking about like emotions and ego and to me it was always just like something
2507.72s: that older dudes talked about because you know for whatever reason I didn't understand it because
2512.36s: obviously when I was 22 in a rush to make money I didn't have an ego at that point obviously.
2518.36s: And you know just it's interesting that you mentioned that though because I think that something
2523.72s: I find fascinating is the markets by definition are in uncertain space and people try to find certainty
2535.40s: by collecting more data points. But what they seem to not totally understand is sometimes it's
2542.28s: exactly like you're saying they kind of just create this narrative for themselves that doesn't
2547.40s: necessarily solve the uncertainty the uncertainties still there you just have more data points that
2551.56s: may not believe in. So that leads me actually to another question and this is actually a genuine
2557.96s: question that I've had for a long time for for technical analysis in general there's a handful of
2564.28s: tools that I like to use. I like to use linear regression channels or standard deviation channels
2568.44s: or some sort maybe Bollinger bands and then typically moving averages maybe fibs sometimes.
2575.16s: But overall pretty limited I do like to use volume and maybe an oscillator just to glance at but not
2583.32s: too heavily. Something that I've always found to be difficult to understand is the idea of market timing
2593.56s: because obviously I've read a bunch of white papers on the behavior of individual investors and
2600.04s: essentially a very difficult time that traders have predicting timing in any capacity. And when I was
2608.76s: reading through your book I actually really liked the way that you use multiple time frames because
2614.68s: it's not so much that you're at least this is my interpretation. It didn't seem so much that you're
2619.56s: necessarily trying to predict much of anything. You're mostly seeing what's happening and what's
2626.04s: most likely to happen thereafter and then you're always still using that stop to kind of catch yourself.
2632.68s: But I'm curious when you're applying your technical analysis to charts is that close to what you're
2640.12s: doing just in terms of trying to understand what's happening and finding the best way to interact with
2645.40s: that or is there more of a predictive paradigm that you're applying?
2651.56s: You know predict is too strong. I like to anticipate. I like to anticipate different scenarios.
2661.00s: And in that if I predict it means I think I know the outcome. But if I anticipate you know at
2667.16s: least this is how I differentiate it. Maybe I'm splitting hairs over the terminology.
2671.64s: But if I anticipate and if I look at the stock that's in the uptrend I missed that first move.
2678.04s: It goes sideways for a day or two and it starts to pull back and then it starts to stabilize a
2683.40s: little bit. That's when I really become interested in it because I say okay you know the primary trend
2688.84s: is higher it was up on big volume. So I look at you know my main tools are you know time frames.
2695.64s: First I want to identify my my candidate on the bigger picture the daily timeframe.
2701.00s: And then as it begins it's pull back I look at a shorter term timeframe.
2705.24s: On the daily timeframe I have as I've mentioned some simple moving averages. I look at volume.
2710.84s: I want to see the volume expanding in the direction of the trend. I want to see relative to that
2715.88s: the lighter volume as it pulls back and finds you know as it settles in to let's say a 20 day moving
2723.48s: average or a Fibonacci or the volume weighted average price off the prior low as it starts to settle
2728.92s: in and show signs that the sellers are losing control the buyers are stepping up a little bit.
2735.72s: I want to think you know okay in terms of supply and demand. If shorts were shorting this because
2743.00s: they thought it was up too much they realized the bigger picture is still higher and they're most
2748.28s: likely going to look to be covering that add source of demand. If there was a big fund that started
2754.04s: you know they have five million shares and they wanted to take a little bit off while they can
2758.76s: they sell it down to the 50 day moving average you know so it wants to get to the 50 day moving
2763.96s: average they'll stop selling because they don't want to hurt the stock in fact they might start
2768.76s: you know put a bid in there to support their position. So I'm trying to think of who are the
2774.20s: players what are they doing how would I feel if I was short what are what would I be doing
2778.92s: whatever if I was long what if I was you know as I am and cash what's the right way to look at this
2784.20s: it's stabilizing you to key level it's starting to show accumulation on a shorter term timeframe
2790.12s: now if is truly in an uptrend and I'm buying it as it emerges after that pullback it should go
2797.08s: on to make a higher high but if it doesn't then you know then then there's maybe something wrong here
2804.20s: but even before it gets to that higher high let's say a pullback from 25 to 22 and I'm trying to buy
2810.36s: it at 22 and a half as it breaks that near term little resistance I want to know if I'm wrong
2817.00s: if it goes below 2180 I'm out because that's the most recent relevant higher low for this
2823.16s: consolidation and that breaks the definition of trend so it's if then if if it breaks I'll buy it
2830.60s: and I will continue to hold it but instead if it breaks lower I need to get out because I'm a
2837.24s: technical trader the definition of trend is higher highs and higher lows we broke that definition
2843.56s: what the hell am I still doing holding this stock I'm not being true to the process
2848.12s: that's pretty powerful I think to be honest I think that a lot of people
2853.40s: um you know when things might might Tyson you know said it the best you know everybody's
2858.92s: a plan to like punch in the mouth yeah and as soon as you know people see something
2865.56s: you know diverting from their original trade hypothesis it seems really common to rationalize it
2872.20s: oh you know this is because of this or because of that and it'll it'll revert it'll be better it'll be
2877.72s: okay you know Eric thank you and I'm sure up to you it goes back to what we were just talking about
2880.92s: you know the fundamental analysis I I like everyone learn my lessons the hard way when I lose big
2888.12s: money that's when I've lost the you know learn these lessons and what I know is in the past when I've
2894.04s: had big losers and if I'm not familiar with the story what do I do you know I'm in a stock I don't
2901.96s: want to sell it I'm stubborn so I start looking at the news I start pulling up research reports I
2908.12s: start trying to find something some shred of hope to hold on to because I know that price isn't it
2915.32s: anymore so you know start to justify it and it's been a long time since I've been in that position
2921.96s: that's that's a great habit to get out of as quick as you can recognize you know you're holding
2928.04s: a loser and you're starting to justify why you're holding it that means sell the stock that's
2933.40s: that's all it means it means that it's arrogant to go in and think that you're going to be right
2939.48s: so part of your plan has to be that risk management saying I could be wrong and I don't want to lose
2946.84s: my money I don't you know I don't mind losing a little bit I still don't like losing you know I
2951.24s: don't like people say love your losers I don't love my lose I agree with that I don't like to lose
2957.40s: yeah we're competitors we want to achieve at high level losing sucks it's part of the process
2963.64s: and you realize that and and sometimes the best way to to you know have that point driven home is
2971.80s: that you do buy the stock at 22 and a half you sell it at 2180 and you look at it the next day it's
2977.88s: $18.50 and then it feels then it feels good then you like your losses a little bit of
2985.80s: orange yeah I'm not the dummy still holding this thing I had my plan and I executed it um so you
2993.08s: know it it all goes back to you know controlling those emotions and the way to do it is to to have
3000.28s: that anticipation I could be right or I could be wrong and if I'm wrong I have to cut my loss
3007.88s: that's that's all the risk to it otherwise you know we've all been there it's just it's just a
3013.80s: disaster and I mean it's a psychological effect that pretty much humans have you know when we
3019.80s: have a winning trade we like to take those off super quick because the ego we like to be right and
3024.20s: we just confirm to being right and when we're wrong we don't want to confirm being wrong so you
3028.52s: just kind of sit there and wait and hold and then you just your loss is exponentially growing
3033.72s: potentially um something to that end actually that I'm a really big advocate of and I'm actually
3040.92s: curious if you apply any sort of version of this it sounds like you do especially with setting your
3046.76s: your stops or wherever you're going to exit but I'm I'm really a big advocate of setting profit
3054.52s: and loss targets before you enter a trade before the emotions are involved and before all of
3060.84s: that exists it sounds like you do that when we're talking to the downside right you talk about
3067.40s: where your next support level is do you do any form of that when it comes to profit taking to know when
3073.80s: to take a winning trade off yeah here's here's how I handle winners is that one of what I consider one
3081.24s: of my key strengths in the market is because I'm looking at multiple time frames and it's not just
3087.16s: the daily in the you know 30 minute chart I'll go down to a 10 minute time frame I'll go down to a
3092.04s: two minute time frame when it comes time to entry so one of my strengths is that I'm pretty
3098.20s: right on my entries um that I'm I'm going to know right away whether I'm right or wrong because
3103.96s: it's going to start to move it's at the level where it's supposed to right so when I enter I enter
3110.44s: at you know at a bigger size intentionally because my timing is good enough that that I know that's
3119.08s: one of my strengths I add a little exercise but my intent is as soon as it begins to rally and
3125.56s: generally I don't know if you're familiar with pivot analysis the the floor trader pivots daily pivot
3132.20s: R1 and R2 S1 and S2 I'll use those as my first level for taking a third of my position
3141.08s: so again if we go back to the stock that was 22 and a half most likely daily R2 would be somewhere around
3150.20s: $23.12 let's say okay so I'll I'll see it run up to daily R2 and I'll either sell some
3157.64s: immediately there because a lot of times that's the high of the day it's because there's a lot of
3162.04s: programs based around them so I'll sell that first third right then and there and and then I'll
3167.88s: hold my two-thirds position what I do with the balances I then raise my stop up to my generally
3175.72s: you know right around my cost basis so if I get stopped out on the two-thirds of break even
3182.44s: and I've taken 60 cents on the first third it means that I'll get I'll be out of the stock with a
3188.52s: 20 cent profit on average so I want to be in a position of strength and winners don't take care
3195.24s: themselves it's about aggressive you know money management once you're in them as well if the stock
3201.56s: continues to rally I'll raise my stop and what I what I'll often do is you know let's say I get a
3207.32s: nice end of day push it ran another dollar and a quarter well I might set half of my stop below
3213.32s: the midday low the next morning the next morning I'll set it below the prior days midday low
3218.68s: and then I'll keep my stop on the other third at break even it might break even cost so
3225.08s: now if I get stopped out of a third with this much gain another third with this much gain
3230.84s: and down here I've got break even I'm going to give that final third a lot more wiggle room
3236.76s: so that maybe I can hold it you know if I don't get stopped out of the second third I'll just
3241.24s: continue to raise that one very aggressively up under the success of higher lows and then the
3246.68s: final third I'll trail it with a wider stop using again the definition of trend but on a larger
3256.20s: time frame so that it might be I can hold this stock for two to three weeks and survive some of
3263.24s: these one and one and a half point pullbacks on a $25 stock now and then I'll get stopped out
3270.68s: let's let's say $26.80 on that final third and maybe I took you know 60 cents on the first third
3278.92s: $2.80 on the second third but I make $6 on the final third it's worth holding that and
3285.96s: you know I never regret selling the early pieces because there's a lot of times where I will sell
3291.40s: that first third for the 60 cent gain I'll get stopped out of the rest at break even and then I'll
3297.16s: see the stock decline and go down a dollar and I got out with 20 cents profit and to me it's
3304.92s: those incremental gains as well and not letting them turn into losers really makes a big difference
3312.04s: at the end of the year I think that I mean that last part really is huge is not allowing winners
3318.20s: to turn into losers that's something I personally trade I'm mostly a derivative trader so I trade
3323.48s: options in futures primarily but when I'm trading longer durations I have a very different strategy
3329.64s: when I'm day trading it literally looks almost identical to that where I'll break a position either
3335.64s: into thirds or quarters right and I find the literally the exact same thing because a lot of times
3344.04s: traders again thinking this like we were talking about earlier fundamental analysis or technical
3350.28s: analysis right traders on or the traders off and they kind of forget to take a little creative
3356.28s: license in there and to play with scaling more a lot of traders I think are too black and white and
3362.20s: they think that if they exit then you know they should exit the whole thing yeah I really like that
3368.12s: so I wanted to talk a little bit more specifically about your technical analysis approach obviously
3376.04s: I was fortunate enough to get a lot of it from from your book but if you were to list out your
3383.96s: typical trading time frame because that last part actually surprised me when you said that
3389.16s: you know sometimes you might take a trade out with that last third you know like two weeks or
3393.00s: something I wasn't anticipating that what kind of time frames would you say you trade generally speaking
3401.08s: I like to I like to think of myself as a swing trader okay so if the stock allows me to
3408.84s: so most of my day trades or either I get stopped out of my what I thought was going to be a swing
3413.88s: trade right away because it violated my stop and I have to move on so the market told me to day trade
3420.28s: I do some day trades when you know when I'm just sitting there there's an opportunity it's just so
3425.56s: obvious that I can't resist taking it but I prefer not to be a day trader okay so I like to swing
3435.40s: trade and generally what the market allows me to do in successful swing trades is hold them the sweet
3444.44s: spot is really probably three to eight days somewhere in there and then if if like I said I've got
3451.96s: final third piece maybe I'll even sell half of that third so now I'm down to one sixth of the position
3459.64s: and I might try to hold that I try to experiment with holding it for a month or six weeks but what I
3467.16s: find out is once I get beyond that two to three week period I'm generally better just being stopped
3474.20s: out rather than trying to hold for a bigger move and of course it's you know dependent on what the
3481.08s: market what phase of the market we're in right now we're you know gross stocks are getting hit hard
3486.92s: they're not bouncing and the ones that follow through don't do so for as long you know three to
3494.36s: three to eight days is you know a longer term window right now for my trades more of them so when
3500.52s: there's great you know heightened sense of uncertainty in the market the market naturally shrinks my
3506.44s: time frame it's not that I'm sometimes I'm thinking well the market's more volatile so I'm going to be
3512.28s: quicker to take a little bit off I'm going to raise my stop you know faster because moves haven't
3518.28s: followed through but other times it's just the market tells me that and and and that's the key is to
3524.68s: really be able to objectively listen to the market and you know and it truly listen not just
3533.00s: hear it but listen and say okay the market's saying get out get out that's that's it and then as I go
3537.88s: through my you know stocks at the end of the day I start to see hey there's more stocks here that
3542.76s: look like they're ready to break down than I've seen in the last week that's the market telling me
3547.80s: something I'm not finding long candidates that's that's important information that the market's telling me
3554.60s: it's saying hey you know maybe it's okay to you know do some smaller short sales so it's all about
3562.12s: trying to be as objective in listening to the message of the market as possible and using the
3568.44s: experience that I've accumulated over the last 30 years to you know make sure I I implement
3575.72s: whatever plan I come up with and not let my ego get in the way there's there's still times it
3580.84s: surprises me Eric that you know it doesn't happen very often but once in a while I look at my account
3586.36s: and go wait a minute who's trading this account today that's that's not me that's not the guy that
3592.12s: that I've trained myself to be in the market that I was an emotional basket case I didn't do anything
3598.44s: right I broke 12 rules today what the heck you know where does that come from it's it's bizarre it's
3605.32s: yeah it's funny you say that because another big it's it's fascinating talking to other traders
3611.72s: because you find so many commonalities because that that's another big one for me is trying to
3618.76s: impose what we want the market to do or what we think the market should do just leads to errors
3625.24s: it just leads to problems yeah and it's exactly like you're saying taking a look at the market and
3629.48s: seeing the best way for us to tailor our current skill set to interface with what the market is doing
3636.36s: tends to be a lot more successful instead of trying to force things onto it and another thing that I
3642.36s: I actually just did a video on this not too long ago is the concept of emotions because a lot of
3648.92s: people talk about this idea of you know trying to be like a machine or a robot and I think that
3653.88s: that just sets people up for failure because at the end of the day we need to control our emotions
3659.24s: with certainty for sure have to do that but you can only control them if you acknowledge they exist
3665.16s: and this idea of you know I'm just going to follow all these rules and like you said sometimes
3669.40s: you know throughout the day you just have this other version of yourself pop out and you're like
3673.48s: who the hell is that guy and you know that that that's emotions at work it's I think it's something
3680.84s: that I've become really interested in and tune with because the way that I keep trade logs is for
3689.64s: especially for shorter term trades I have like a couple note section that I have to fill out
3694.52s: and I'll read them I literally go through this big annual review at the end of the year and I'm
3698.20s: reading through some of them now and it's it's legitimately kind of funny because I can look at
3702.36s: it and be like who the hell is that guy some of this is really emotional
3706.92s: the more experience you get the good news is that you recognize those periods quicker you
3714.52s: recognize them during the day when you're down x p and l and don't continue to fight and chase you
3721.96s: instead you you know hey back off you're you're exhibiting you know dangerous behavior to your
3728.20s: financial well being here back off slow down go for a walk do something get away from the screen
3735.00s: for a while go reset and that's you know I think the human nature is always going to we're always
3741.96s: going to have some little self-destructive seed that if we let it ferment it's going to turn into
3749.48s: something stronger but it the key is to recognize it quicker and then take the preventative actions
3757.56s: that that to me is is you know it used to be that that this alter ego would show up once or twice a
3764.76s: year and my big thing was that I wouldn't find a stock that's down too much and I would buy just a
3772.28s: little bit you know to test the waters and then it dropped you know let's say let's say I'd buy
3778.36s: 400 shares but then it drops three dollars and I'm looking at it going well I have to buy more
3783.80s: now I'm not going to sell at 1200 and then I'd you know puke it out at the end of the day for a
3790.92s: $20,000 loss and go wait a minute I that's not how I trade what right happened there so now that
3798.92s: doesn't happen on you know with with his bigger number it's it but I I'm more in tune with catching
3806.28s: it catching it quickly and correcting it and saying wait a minute this is just stupid don't for
3811.96s: don't forget the times you did this and it cost you a lot just move to the sidelines stop right yeah
3819.56s: I it's for me I I don't really day trade super frequently anymore actually fall into a more
3825.16s: similar category to you where I probably manage my trades within 20 days normally okay but when I do
3832.60s: venture into day trading I've set like a couple hard and fast rules one of which is as soon as I get
3840.20s: stopped out like three times in a row on something like that's just go do something else that's it
3844.52s: for the day yeah and it's just because for me luckily day trading isn't really the the primary you
3850.36s: know development approach that I have or income approach at this point but I have learned that once I
3856.60s: start having successive stops then sometimes you know I get well I got to get this right you know I
3863.48s: got to figure it out and then all of a sudden you know it's just stupid mistakes yeah um you
3868.68s: mentioned a little bit you know obviously some important habits you've developed over time and if
3876.60s: you were to list out like maybe your top three or five habits that you've developed since you
3883.00s: started trading to now what would those be uh number one don't chase moves I mean that that's so
3890.92s: easy to get excited and feel that FOMO and chase stocks always ask yourself where has it come from
3898.68s: you know it has an expanded much energy getting to where it is where does it have the potential
3903.40s: ago is it running into an important prior level of support that has the potential to become resistance
3911.08s: and think of it as fresh money what's my risk reward here if I was the guy who bought three days
3918.12s: ago when it was 15% lower and it's now breaking out it makes sense to sell some to the breakout
3925.16s: chasers so ask those questions where does it come from where does it have the potential to go my
3931.48s: habits are to you know just continually uh you know scan the market manually with my own two eyes
3940.52s: looking at you know getting a better feel for the market by looking at a lot of stocks looking at
3945.64s: stocks I know I'm not going to trade but you're saying here the themes that seem to be setting up
3950.20s: it's not that I'm going to scan and tell the market here's the list of types of stocks I want to buy
3957.08s: instead I want to listen to the market I I have a general idea of what I want and I could program
3962.84s: that very easily but I don't get the same feel for the market so for me I have to be in tune with
3968.44s: the market and you know let's say I come back from vacation most like I was looking at the market
3973.88s: on vacation a little bit right but I often won't trade that first day because I my feel isn't there
3980.44s: I my I haven't been involved with actual money in the market I can look at the charts
3987.32s: right and and know where we are in the overall cycle but my feel isn't there so I I need to just
3994.84s: you know sometimes just slow things down a little bit is and that's a habit as well just slow things
4001.40s: down don't have to try to be involved in everything it's again just I every once in a while I'll
4009.56s: put a video out about you know just some habits that I think are important you know that I looking
4014.60s: back and I really like the one you mentioned about slowing down because a lot of people I find myself
4021.24s: I literally this morning I was like doing my morning workout and I was watching something and it
4026.12s: started to move and I was like immediately starting to place a trade I was like whoa like chill out
4031.40s: dude you're not even like I didn't know if that earnings coming up anything and I was like setting
4035.80s: this trade up on my phone and I realize like I still have that tendency sometimes where I feel like
4041.80s: I'm gonna miss something you know if I don't jump in right now that photo that you're talking about
4046.52s: so I think that that cautionary tale in general like slowing down is just really powerful
4053.80s: with Eric it just real quickly I mean I I have those feelings once in a while too I'll be looking at
4059.80s: my phone you know in bed going what's the market doing and I'll see something happening but I
4066.20s: I try not to look at my phone or look at the market until I don't like to be in front of my
4071.16s: computer at the most for more than an hour before the market opens only if there's an economic
4077.32s: event but generally I like to be in front of the computer about a half hour before the market
4083.24s: because sometimes I just get itchy and I and I know this about me and I'll buy something in the
4088.36s: market when I know I shouldn't and those end up being mistakes more often than not so to
4096.36s: you know prevent myself from doing that I say well I'm not allowed to sit in front of the computer
4101.56s: till nine nine Eastern right gives me the ability I can read you know I can read my little summary
4107.64s: newsletters and and that sort of thing but I can't let myself get in front of price action
4112.60s: because I'm not good at trading in the pre-market and it ends up costing me money so I I'm not
4119.64s: allowed to do it I don't I you know I don't allow myself right yeah it's it's funny because it is
4124.92s: one of those things that I feel like over time you definitely learn to get a handle on but it's
4131.72s: interesting to hear you know that the the urge is still there if you accept I say it all the time
4136.68s: I say jokingly but anybody who actively trades we all have a little bit of generate in us somewhere
4142.68s: in there yeah we got that dude that just wants to get in there and it's just start slinging money
4147.88s: and it's important obviously keep that in its proper place because it gets out of control click
4154.84s: so I wanted to ask you another kind of list of some of your favorites but this one I
4161.56s: wanted to pivot to kind of your favorite TA tools so from your book you actually do a like really
4172.28s: really great job outlining a lot of the tools that you like to use in the circumstances you like
4178.44s: to use I you know obviously a lot of talk about moving averages involving you know things like that
4182.92s: which funny enough those are probably some of the the primary tools that I generally also use
4189.56s: which I think is just a indication of how universally they can be applied depending on you know
4194.92s: your trading approach but I'm really curious if again if you were to give a handful of your
4201.00s: must technical trading tools what are those obviously price only price pays I had to throw that in
4208.92s: there at some point price volume some moving averages simple moving averages whether it's
4216.04s: simpler exponential as irrelevant multiple time frames anchored volume weighted average price
4224.28s: and the lower tiered ones I do a little bit of Fibonacci stuff just general retracements pivot levels
4235.16s: as I discussed and what else sometimes I look at a volume volume by price seldom but sometimes I
4245.64s: look at that so the keys are price multiple time frames moving averages volume volume weighted
4253.56s: average price got it and just at a curiosity how did you come across like how did that anchor at
4260.60s: VWOP find its way into your toolkit because I actually found that to be pretty unique to you other
4265.80s: people will talk about it but like that also came through when I was reading some of what what you
4271.00s: talk about and I found that interesting because a lot of people talk about VWOP but not everybody
4276.52s: actually ties it to an anchor so how did that come to how did that come to be well in 2003 I was
4283.40s: trading on a platform called RealTick and RealTick had you know the daily volume weighted average price
4289.08s: on there that represented it as a moving average it's not a moving average but it represented like
4294.44s: one on your chart and then they had a trend tool called you know that you could drag from left
4301.00s: to right it would show up as a horizontal line and when I drag it across the screen it would go
4306.12s: up and down and it would keep hitting at prices so it was actually a volume weighted average trendline
4313.00s: that were it was kind of weird to analyze but then I started playing with the when I had the
4319.88s: volume weighted average price on a chart I realized that if I changed the time frame to like 10
4325.88s: minutes and went back 10 days it would give me the 10 day volume weighted average price so I started
4332.76s: just I would play around with the date in the time frame to see hey well from that earnings report
4339.40s: I wonder what the volume weighted average price was that was 13 days ago so I'd have to just switch
4344.04s: it to a 13 day view and it allowed me to basically anchor from that point so I started noticing how
4351.48s: how relevant it was to price action that institutions were either defending it or you know on the
4359.08s: on the long or short side and it became you know like a hidden point where buyers and sellers would show
4365.24s: up so I you know kind of played around with that for a while and and asked RealTick if they could
4372.12s: you know build it as a tool that you could anchor from any point they never did it but Tc2000 did
4379.16s: about five years ago and they put it on as the volume weighted average price by alpha trends that's
4385.32s: my handle and now it's you know point and click and it's on you know from from that introduction about
4393.40s: five years ago it's now on about a dozen different platforms where you can very easily anchor from
4399.24s: any point forward to understand who's in control with absolute 100% certainty from any point in time
4407.16s: right that it's not a subjective analysis tool it's factual supply and demand that's fascinating and
4415.00s: what time frame do you normally like to use for your anchor whatever's relevant I put them on a
4423.96s: a chart from five years ago where there was a significant high and maybe it's you know undergone a
4432.04s: long-term accumulation it pops up and you'd be surprised it hits it to the T you know runs 20%
4440.84s: hits that VWAP from the peak five years ago and then pulls back I mean it's crazy so I'll look at
4447.16s: them I want to be aware of all the time frames generally speaking now it's not often I go to a weekly
4454.36s: time frame and look to anchor something but if I can't find it on my daily chart I want to be aware
4460.52s: of what's on the bigger picture is there's something there I should be aware of that has the
4464.76s: potential to become support resistance the longer it's been out there the less likely it's going to
4470.36s: have current memory attached to it but there's still people like myself who will look at it and
4475.64s: decide not to buy because it's close to that or to take some profits because it's close to that
4480.20s: level so intraday you know I like to use it on by you know 15-minute time frames or 30-minute time
4488.36s: frames so I can see the height 20 days ago and the low eight days ago and how they converge together
4495.80s: to form you know a volume-weighted average price pension you know you can see factually that transition
4503.24s: supply controlled market to demand you know reaching that equilibrium the the battle reaching the
4509.72s: equilibrium and then where demand retakes that control with again 100% certainty that the
4516.84s: average price from that point the buyers are in control right right that makes it's on a sense
4524.20s: and then another question I have is where do Fibonacci's fit into this because you were kind of
4529.16s: mentioning that they're like a secondary tier where do those of it in real?
4532.92s: Well at times I'll just use them as a again second tertiary tier level that I'll see the stock
4539.24s: that goes from 28 to 35 and then it pulls back to the rising 20-day moving average and I'll
4547.40s: look at the 28 to 35 and I'll put a Fibonacci and say hey it's right there at the 61.8% retracement
4554.44s: so I want to look at and say you know what's the psychology of the rising 20-day moving average
4560.44s: okay the psychology is shorts will cover as it approaches that longs will you know try to establish
4567.80s: support for their bigger position in their sideline money will come in shorts will not want to
4573.96s: short it so it's a transition of supply and demand at this level deemed important by the market
4580.76s: a smaller piece is a 61.8% retracement level when it pulls back there the people
4587.40s: account your trend shorts will say hey we should cover it's a 61.8% pullback it's still in a
4592.68s: primary uptrend let's take our profits a big institution will say hey it's pulled back 61.8%
4599.72s: we've got five million shares this thing we sold 300,000 let's bid for a hundred thousand so
4605.64s: it sticks in this level sideline cash will come in and say hey I'm a Fibonacci guy I buy 61.8%
4612.44s: retracements so it's all about trying to determine how the psychology and supply and demand comes
4617.88s: together through those various participants to form the basis of hey we're at an inflection
4625.56s: level potential support because it's the 20-day moving average because it's the VWAP from that
4630.76s: prior low and it's the 61.8% retracement so we have three different groups of participants long
4638.20s: short and cash coming together in the same area to to find the same conclusion that one we shouldn't
4645.88s: sell short or if we were short we should cover if we're on the sidelines and cash maybe we start
4651.24s: to nibble and you know just forms that psychology the I'm sorry the the picture of supply and demand
4659.48s: by understanding you know the motivations of the participants right and then can you settle a
4665.64s: debate do you like to draw your Fibonacci's from highs and lows or from close and opens
4672.60s: a highs and lows yeah I like to encompass the whole range and same is true for the VWAP you know I
4679.40s: want to know the I want to know the psychology of all the participants within that range got it that
4686.68s: makes it ton of sense okay cool so I wanted to wrap things up being mindful of your time and one of the
4698.52s: couple last questions I had for you is obviously looking back 2020 2022 just really unique time frame
4706.36s: you know in the markets even from the covid drop to the parabolic recovery but I'm curious to get
4712.76s: just your general sentiments you know again just looking through your paradigm at the markets
4718.52s: what did you what stood out in 2021 and what was kind of something either that was impactful that you
4725.56s: didn't expect anything like that um I think that there's you know a lot of things you can look at in
4731.32s: the market and you know learn lessons from and to me that it's just kind of reiterating what I
4738.68s: kind of already know that you know it to me it doesn't make sense to buy dips that people fall in
4745.08s: love with names again going back to some of these leaders that that have been hit so hard down 50 80%
4753.64s: and people are stuck on zoom and peloton and paypal and you know the list goes on and on and on
4759.88s: uh so you know staying true to the trend rather than the story is what helps me avoid losing money
4771.40s: more than anything and then focusing on the stocks that are in those low risk positions and to me it's
4779.32s: you know I I don't I'm not a person that has grand you know themes for next year I think that
4786.68s: they're kind of foolish to to do for my time frame I have the ability to be flexible if my time frame
4793.72s: is three to eight days why on earth would I try to project something a year out and say well my price
4799.00s: target for the S&P this year and I think these industry groups are going to lead or whatever
4803.88s: it's got nothing to do with how I put money into the market and move it in and out so to me it's
4810.36s: always about staying true to the process staying focused on being religious about cutting losers
4817.56s: position sizing you know risk management money management in terms of overall portfolio in in
4823.96s: one position when do I hit the gas when when the light is green and when do I slow down and
4830.36s: and just nibble on things uh on tester pieces to you know I I would still want to be involved in the
4837.56s: stock but the market's not really showing me good signs so I I'd hate for it to go without me
4845.56s: but I want to be involved without a lot of risks so taking smaller positions and just being flexible
4851.96s: I think is is what I want to be able to continue to do is is to you know I hate to repeat myself
4860.60s: over and over again but I want to objectively listen to the market as best I can and not force
4868.36s: my opinions but find those low risk high probability setups cut my losers quickly if the market tells
4875.80s: me to and and you know do the best job I can holding is big a piece for as long as is the trade lets me
4884.36s: right right so you hit a little bit of kind of you know your time frame that you like to look at
4891.56s: so don't have to go into specifics here but for the last question I am curious when you're
4897.08s: like just getting ready for 2022 what kind of things come into your mind obviously not necessarily
4904.20s: talking about price prediction market drops you know stuff like that but just you know when we're
4908.20s: looking at the next year what are some factors that you're integrating into that lens well I
4915.16s: think it's more about you know having my mind in a good place and being well rested and you know
4922.92s: not deviating from my plans and making sure that I've done the homework the night before so that I'm
4928.60s: thoroughly prepared for the next day that I'm staying healthy that I'm you know I've been doing
4935.80s: it long enough that it's it's it's not about hey I need to read a new book about money management
4941.88s: it's about am I holding myself accountable to the truths that I know and they're not letting
4947.96s: myself get distracted by something on you know I don't I don't watch CNBC because it doesn't help me
4955.32s: it in fact hurts me and not because it's bad information but it just it distracts me
4960.28s: right and and someone will be talking about a stock I'll pull it up I'll be bored and I'll trade it
4964.76s: and I'll lose money because I haven't done the work not letting Twitter become a distraction
4972.04s: not for me it's about tuning out the outside noise making sure that my mind is in a place where
4979.80s: I can perform at my best making sure I know that I can execute what I know that I've learned through
4989.24s: a lot of hard experience cutting the same same things we've been talking about
4994.36s: yeah I actually really like that I think that's like a great ending note to focus more on your
5000.28s: personal game plan and less on the external noise yeah so I think I think a lot of people get wrapped
5005.80s: up in that even myself included sometimes I know when AMC was going crazy at the beginning of the year
5011.80s: and you know I wasn't participating I was watching it very closely and then I started nibbling
5017.48s: and the trade worked out thankfully but you know what I mean that's exactly what you're talking about
5023.00s: I was definitely paying a lot of attention to external noise little FOMO came in so I started
5027.72s: nibbling but that can be dangerous so again that's the degenerate in me coming out yeah we
5035.48s: if he lives in there but this thank you so much for taking some time to chat with us the
5043.32s: the perspective you bring I really think it's fascinating and I think it's something that a lot
5047.56s: of people that follow the at least my channel are interested in because I again have a certain lens
5055.64s: that I apply to the market but your lens also applies to a lot of people and I mean I'm even excited
5061.88s: to learn more about what you do when you're expertise so thank you for taking some time to hang out
5068.20s: yeah thank you so much Eric and you and all the vets out there that you know I've made sacrifices
5074.12s: in ways that I can't begin to realize so I appreciate that and you know there's all kinds of ways
5080.60s: to the finish line here in the market and you know that one of the things I would encourage people
5085.24s: to do is to make sure that you find one that's truly suitable to your personality and you know
5091.80s: figuring out what your time frame is and you know tuning out noise and just being as objective
5099.08s: about the you know getting the results as possible yeah well thank you and we definitely you know
5104.52s: appreciate you taking the time to to share what you know with us and your expertise and
5109.88s: definitely would love to have you on again one time we were talking a little before about you
5113.40s: and maybe looking at some charts and having you walk us through well specifically walk me through
5117.48s: because I would love to learn you know more about your approach and what not I think that'd be a great
5121.64s: time that's where I'm at my best Eric that's all perfect that lines up beautifully because I love
5127.80s: being a student so I'm looking forward to it very cool thanks again all right thanks Brian
