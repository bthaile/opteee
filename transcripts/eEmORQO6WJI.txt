0.00s: Markets will forever continue to fascinate me, but people like roaring kitty are the anomalies.
7.52s: You can't not be completely infatuated what this guy is doing.
12.52s: So the goal of this video is actually to walk through his options position and talk about
17.20s: the settlement that's coming up on 21 June and how that might play out and the potential
22.08s: impacts to the markets.
24.12s: Now, to be very clear, I'm nowhere near as close to this entire saga as a lot of other
29.68s: people are and shout out to the apes.
32.28s: However, I am familiar with options.
34.64s: So I want to focus on that perspective.
36.64s: I'll definitely tie in as much general information as I can, but it would be super helpful if
41.52s: you guys can throw in the comments, the pieces that help fit this whole story together,
46.40s: because I'm trying to share as much information as I can about the position.
51.20s: What's up, everyone?
52.20s: Eric here.
53.20s: Welcome back to the outliers.
54.20s: Let's get right in.
55.20s: So we have this gym to start off with.
58.44s: And this essentially says screw it.
60.40s: If DFV exercises that I don't know if it's a banana or a plant teen is going in someone's
66.12s: rectum, the bold move cotton and we'll see if this person indeed has 50 pound testies
75.12s: because that's probably what they're going to need in order to facilitate that movement.
78.56s: But I want to highlight that because if you want to talk about one of the most fascinating
82.80s: groups of people to watch, it's the community.
85.76s: I am.
86.76s: They're just the coolest people ever.
88.12s: This is hilarious to me and everything that they're doing and everything that they're
91.40s: standing for is also so cool.
94.32s: It's why I hold shares of both AMC and GME.
98.72s: It's literally just to support you guys in your movement because I find it so cool.
104.56s: All right.
105.56s: So let's talk a little bit about what's going on in the last few days.
108.44s: So this is from Superstank and we saw a position posted by DFV.
114.32s: And this is again on the second of June and it highlights his initial position.
119.76s: So what I see here is that we have 5 million shares of GameStop at 21, 27 and then we
126.04s: have 120,000 of the 21 June 20 calls that were entered in at $5, 6, 75, 4 average price.
139.40s: So you can see the value of these positions and then he's sitting in about 29 mil cash.
144.92s: This actually is pretty important.
146.68s: By the way, this 29 million cash.
149.60s: And let's take a look at what was posted on the third of June.
152.36s: We can see that he was up 78.6 million dollars at the time of that post.
157.48s: That's wild.
159.60s: And the position was doing well.
161.44s: And then we can fast forward again to the 6th of June.
163.80s: So this is yesterday, today's the seventh of the June, the day of the live stream.
167.44s: We'll grab some pieces from that in just a second.
170.52s: And you can see his position here up a quarter of a billion dollars.
176.80s: Again, absolutely crazy.
179.52s: So a couple things to know.
182.56s: As of this posting, the position obviously was crushing it and there's been a lot of speculation.
188.36s: There's been people popping up like this from Citroen research who this dude is known
193.72s: to be short GameStop.
195.44s: We know he has a short GameStop position.
197.64s: And it's not surprising at all to see him taking this angle, essentially trying to diminish
205.08s: the value of the position and trying to paint it in a negative light because quite literally
209.16s: his fund depends on it.
210.24s: He's in terrible, terrible position right now.
214.44s: You can take a look at this article from Yahoo Finance and he got crushed on his previous
222.08s: attempt.
223.32s: And now he is back at it.
227.16s: So and as you can see from here, he's back at attempting to short the stock.
233.84s: Now his position so far would have been up then down if we take a reference of how the
240.84s: performance has been so far, at least in the past week.
244.40s: And you can see it's pretty sporadic.
246.36s: I'll get myself out of the way so that you can see because the volume bars here matter
249.16s: a lot.
250.24s: So his short would have been absolutely hammered here.
253.08s: It's not looking great here either, but definitely better off than where it was early in the
257.52s: week.
258.52s: But the reason why all of that matters is because there's a lot of people out there that are
261.48s: trying to kind of press this down from an institutional perspective.
268.12s: And you can see relics of that, which again, there's something to be said about just being
272.64s: wrong in a position.
274.04s: Okay.
275.04s: So let's get over here and let's get into the details a bit more on his actual position
281.20s: and what this could look like.
283.80s: If we take a look at the option position itself, he essentially entered it in and it was
290.20s: a $68 million outlay.
292.76s: When you're purchasing options like this, you are paying for them upfront in cash.
298.52s: So this means that at this juncture, obviously he had enough cash to enter this entire position
303.80s: and he still has $29.5 million left over.
307.72s: However, if you notice, the noctional value of this position is massive and it's much
314.40s: more capital than what he has available now.
318.52s: It's essentially equivalent to 12 million shares, which in addition to his five million
323.64s: would make him the fourth largest shareholder, which brings on a bunch of SEC regulations
329.92s: when it comes to his positions going forward from that.
332.12s: But the main thing of interest here is the fact that people are talking about whether he's
338.40s: going to exercise, how he wants to approach that.
340.92s: And one of the big issues is having the capital to exercise because right here, he's not
345.28s: even close.
346.28s: He needs a lot more money in order to be able to exercise this entire thing.
350.52s: Now let's talk about those scenarios though.
353.52s: The first scenario, it doesn't look like it's very likely to happen, is the options could
360.84s: expire worthless.
362.08s: What scenario would they expire worthless if these 20 calls that are out in 21 June fall
367.00s: out of the money?
369.12s: So for example, if we come in here to today's expiration, all of these options that are
373.64s: out of the money will be worth nothing.
376.48s: They will expire worthless.
378.16s: His options right now are very deep in the money.
380.60s: Even with the recent down moves, there's still over an 80 delta trading essentially for
385.92s: double the value that he got in at.
388.24s: So overall, you can see that his position is still completely fine.
392.40s: He's the lion's share of this open interest existing and there's only 13,600 transacted
398.60s: today at this level.
400.68s: Now the other thing I noticed when I was looking at this is it has tremendous call skew,
405.84s: right?
406.84s: It's a real surprise based on his position, but his position is large enough to completely
413.16s: skew the options as they sit from a volume perspective.
417.84s: And if we go to OI, you can see that there's massive, massive call skew, which for those
423.00s: that don't know, you typically see puts skew with things priced into the downside.
426.64s: But if we isolate the series that he's in, you can see that he's again a big pusher of
435.12s: the call skew here.
436.60s: But even without him, there still is some call skew present, which is interesting.
441.96s: Now if we take a look at the following expiration beyond that, there's even still some residual
446.32s: call skew, although it's a little bit lighter.
449.24s: And if we look at these shorter term, explorations, there is slight put skew.
455.20s: So right now the markets are a little bit all over the place, but you can see that there
459.32s: is option transactions leading to upward pricing thesis that's pretty clear for me to identify.
468.68s: Another thing that I find really interesting as of right now is notice the implied volatility
472.92s: for the near term explorations compared to this 21 June.
476.24s: This actually surprises me and it might be the market expecting him not to have the capital
481.00s: to actually exercise his shares.
483.84s: Because if we go back over here and we look at these other scenarios, if he tries to
487.48s: sell to close this position entirely possible, but it's 120,000 shares in time is starting
493.64s: to dwindle.
494.64s: So what's going to happen is he's essentially going to be bidding against himself.
498.28s: He's going to run out of liquidity because most of the ape army salute to you guys again,
503.80s: you're buying it, right?
505.40s: So then we need to find opportunities to offset the position and sell them.
510.52s: So the market makers will be able to have a bit of a field day with the liquidity here
515.24s: in terms of the spreads that they quote him.
516.68s: They still have to be fair, but you'll get definitely beat up on the spreads and on exit
521.72s: liquidity.
522.80s: Then we have the really interesting scenarios exercise and this is where Mo as absolutely
528.04s: comes into the conversation.
529.44s: Now how much into the conversation it comes is up for debate because if we take a look
535.68s: at if he does exercise, if he does have the capital or his access to the capital in order
541.44s: to support onboarding all of these shares, including marginal value, if you choose to
545.44s: take them on margin, the market makers then need to locate this 12 million shares of a
552.96s: generally low float stock.
555.92s: This kicks off what very likely can be a massive gamma squeeze.
562.16s: Gamma squeezes are very similar to a short squeeze, except the primary difference here
566.60s: is that it's driven by market maker behavior, not individual trader, not the trader perspective.
573.08s: It's driven by market makers.
575.60s: And this can have pretty serious cascading effects because this increases demand for the
580.96s: stock heavily.
581.96s: And again, the fact that it's low float is really, really important.
587.08s: What started to cause this is again by the ape community very smartly DRSing their shares.
594.08s: So that kind of system, the direct registration system essentially locks those shares up so
598.68s: that they can't be moved around.
600.64s: Now when we look at the overall short position as it sits now, you can see that the short
606.72s: interest is actually scaling up.
608.80s: It's 68 million.
611.28s: And this is where it gets interesting.
612.68s: The short interest ratio right now is 3.3 days to cover.
616.04s: This is where it starts to get very interesting because as the percentage of shares shorted
622.44s: goes up slightly, they become even more scarce.
626.24s: The duration to cover them as it goes up causes an issue because then we have to locate
631.96s: shares quickly that are not there as other people are trying to get to those same shares.
637.32s: And that's what creates a scarcity, gamma squeeze, then short squeeze.
641.48s: So this is a fascinating position to have on right now of interest.
645.76s: However, is this game stop is potentially looking to
652.28s: offer more?
654.88s: This can cause further share dilution.
657.96s: The timing of this being brought up was a little strange compared to when DFV started
663.60s: talking about his positions.
665.72s: But again, you guys know way more about this than I do.
668.32s: So I would love any ideas on the connection here.
671.28s: But I find the timing of this interesting.
673.88s: There are pros and cons in terms of the gamma squeeze thesis, the severity of it would
678.84s: be diminished by this process.
681.56s: However, so for those that don't know, you can go to DFV's page right here and you can
688.00s: check out all of his recent posts.
692.68s: And it shows essentially by the last few days what this has been looking like.
697.88s: And if you check out his live stream from today, you can see his positions as they were.
703.88s: And most importantly, you can be reinforced at how this dude has quite literal diamond
708.76s: hands as he's down $235 million still holding like a freaking soldier.
715.32s: The other thing is the stream was kind of interesting.
717.20s: I didn't catch the whole thing, but you could tell that this is a really smart dude that
722.40s: is doing a lot of trolling.
724.20s: And I love to see it.
726.20s: It's some of the coolest stuff to watch somebody with this kind of capital playing the games
730.32s: that he is against the people that he is.
732.00s: It's just an absolute blast.
734.24s: Now the tricky part here again is this cash perspective.
738.00s: So if we go back in here and we think about the exercise scenario, there's another scenario
743.08s: in here where there could be a partial exercise where he doesn't exercise his entire position,
748.32s: but some of it.
749.72s: And that would still have a similar effect potentially causing a gamus squeeze, but it
754.24s: might not be to the same magnitude.
756.56s: So whether or not you care about this or not whether or not you're a game stop buyer
760.76s: seller, none of that really matters.
762.88s: If you're involved in markets at all, you should be watching this.
766.76s: This is an absolute anomaly, a spectacle of a scenario that might not ever happen again.
772.36s: If you have any questions or anything to add to the dialogue, please throw it in the
776.92s: comments below so I can learn more about this alongside with you guys.
780.80s: Be an outlier.
781.80s: I'll see you all later.
