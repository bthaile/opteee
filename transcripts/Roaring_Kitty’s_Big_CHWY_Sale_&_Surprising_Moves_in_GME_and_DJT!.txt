0.64s: what's up outliers calling in from
2.60s: Florida we're on the mobile setup so
4.24s: forgive the lighting but I want to talk
5.60s: about two things today we have the
7.68s: recent new filing regarding roaring
10.48s: Kitty dropping his chewy position which
12.64s: you can see here this is nothing new we
15.00s: can kind of take a look and deconstruct
16.64s: what actually happened there and then I
18.44s: also want to take a look at GameStop in
20.72s: kind of parallel because I had a pretty
22.04s: big move yesterday while I was traveling
24.32s: and then I also want to look at djt
26.64s: because I actually have on a pretty
28.96s: significant trade in here we'll talk
30.40s: about the trade another time but I do
32.20s: want to talk about the underlying itself
34.16s: and its movements so first things first
36.68s: let's grab this and let's take a look at
40.72s: this new
42.68s: 13g so you can see the date that it
45.36s: requires the update which was the 30th
48.40s: of September and you can see now that he
52.32s: holds nothing so the interesting part
55.92s: here actually I wanted to see it doesn't
58.16s: say anything about the cat I wonder why
61.16s: not do you make anything of that because
63.68s: the first time he had the joke in there
65.64s: of um I am not a cat but this one
69.56s: doesn't which I
71.48s: I I just find that interesting I don't
73.60s: know if it actually means anything notth
76.08s: or not but yeah so this obviously
79.36s: happened a little while ago so let's
81.12s: take a look at 30 September on the chart
84.16s: and let's see what it looks like here
86.36s: and it's for a couple reasons that I
88.52s: want to talk about this the main thing
90.80s: is if we go to 30 September which is
94.44s: right here you can see this is very
97.76s: unlikely where he Unwound his position
100.56s: um just cuz the volume is so low but I
103.00s: think the broader speculation is that it
105.08s: happened in here is about the 20th of
108.64s: September and then he has a window that
110.84s: he has to provide an update on so from
113.88s: essentially that point forward though
115.52s: chwy has just been rolling over and this
117.44s: just goes back to the fact that we can
119.52s: clear really tell the cat just likes to
121.88s: play around he's just playing games he's
123.60s: just trolling he just picked up 9
125.52s: million shares of a company to play
127.12s: around have some fun and he Unwound it
130.04s: it didn't I haven't done the math yet we
131.68s: could take a look on it during the gme
133.20s: stream this weekend but it doesn't look
135.52s: like he did super great in there right
137.48s: it doesn't really look like much
139.28s: happened in terms of profit or loss at
140.88s: least in terms of what he would care
142.08s: about so it's literally for the LS which
144.40s: is hilarious to me now this also is kind
149.16s: of interesting if we take a look at
150.72s: GameStop GameStop had a massive day
153.76s: yesterday of course while I was
155.24s: traveling it got active so GameStop
158.04s: yesterday opened at
160.08s: 2083 and then it closed down at 2273 so
164.12s: a really really significant run here and
166.76s: today it's actually holding which is
169.20s: quite fascinating I imagine the news
170.84s: today from the cat dropping chewy
173.00s: probably will impact this that would be
175.12s: my
175.88s: underlying um assumption at least for a
178.28s: little bit just because it most people
180.48s: will make the natural leap out of chewy
183.08s: maybe was out of GameStop maybe not
184.68s: nobody knows we'll be back in GameStop
186.64s: we'll know if he posts another yellow
188.20s: update what his new cost basis is
190.16s: Because unless he can time it perfectly
192.12s: which would be exceedingly unlikely
194.56s: we'll be able to see so it's just a
196.16s: matter of time until we find out what
198.24s: ended up happening with the uh with the
201.04s: GameStop position while he moved over to
202.60s: chewy so not a whole lot of reason to
204.80s: speculate there but take a look at the
206.36s: volume here even the volume on the 25th
209.36s: start started jacking up pretty
211.68s: meaningfully before the 28th so this is
214.00s: actually not I talked about this in the
215.88s: Discord but I ended up buying calls that
218.40s: I thought were cheap a little further
220.20s: out in time um I think 15 April 25 is
223.48s: what I ended up getting I want to say
225.40s: the 30s or the 20s either of those I
229.44s: don't remember but the whole idea was
232.60s: the position was relatively cheap so I
236.84s: wanted to take advantage of it and I saw
238.52s: the volume starting to expand so I just
240.28s: put on a little bit of a tester position
242.44s: that now I'm just kind of continuing to
244.48s: hold cuz it's it's working so let's take
247.12s: a look at GameStop options here we still
249.88s: have 623,000 calls against 226 puts so
253.56s: pretty massive call oi I just realized I
256.28s: got a little thing on the screen there
257.56s: got to get that off and I I mean this
261.80s: just hasn't been super active and I'm
264.52s: very curious if this will start to
266.76s: become a little more active in the next
268.80s: couple days or not based on this new
270.72s: news I'm going to keep a very very close
272.96s: eye because now that that Capital we
275.76s: know it's already been rotated out at
278.52s: least out of Chewy from the cat we can
280.84s: see if he's doing anything back in here
283.08s: the other thing is I don't think the
284.80s: timing of him releasing that news on
286.80s: Chewy was uh inconsequential because he
290.12s: has a lot of opportunity in terms of
292.48s: what the window was for the reporting
294.00s: period he had he had some time so I do
296.44s: think that there's a little bit of
297.64s: purpose behind it although a little
299.28s: early to tell uh what that is just yet
302.76s: so volatility definitely has ticked up
305.04s: last time I looked at this there
306.20s: literally wasn't anything even over 100
308.60s: and now we see 111 106 100 so plenty of
312.04s: volatility in here really really
313.52s: interesting stuff I think so we'll have
315.32s: to keep an eye on any big transactions
318.16s: coming through we can see 32% of the
320.28s: transactions today were calls and there
321.68s: was 188,000 of them so that is people
325.00s: starting to get active again based off
326.76s: of the cat news as I would imagine and
329.44s: the oi tomorrow will become very
331.80s: interesting because take a look at this
333.80s: the volume 188,000 contracts are
336.68s: literally for the one nove expiration so
339.64s: you can see that's good old 3 days from
341.44s: now so people are jumping into these
343.92s: near-term options we can also see in the
346.28s: 15 no there's a little bit of buildout
348.08s: going on which is interesting all right
349.96s: now let's take a peek at
351.64s: djt and I also have a position on in
354.48s: here that I entered into a little while
356.04s: back just based on the the movement this
358.64s: was not cheap in terms of of Evol
360.12s: perspective was actually quite expensive
362.08s: but it just looked generally interesting
364.28s: to me and now it's still holding over 55
367.80s: this is a parabolic move it's gone from
371.12s: 1175 essentially to 55 and it's done
374.64s: that from the 24th of September until
378.28s: today so like a month
381.00s: absolutely absolutely maddening move
383.88s: take a look at the volume today 167
387.08s: million and if you take a look at the 5
389.68s: day average volume it's 85 mil against
393.12s: what is it for the 28 51 mil so just
396.80s: explosion in volume for me this is a
400.68s: highly speculative play that I'm
402.52s: actually have to update a couple uh
405.20s: couple candle alerts here because for me
407.96s: I'm just following it up I've already
409.68s: taken a pretty meaningful part of the
411.48s: position down on the the 28th and the
415.60s: what's left now are just Runners there
417.36s: are things that I can essentially let go
419.36s: to Zer if I want and I still would be
420.96s: sitting on a very significantly sized
423.52s: winner in here which we'll do a trade
426.04s: wrap up on it when it's done if you guys
427.52s: are interested in the trade in djt let
429.24s: me know I'm happy to talk more about it
430.76s: but it's just in progress so I don't
432.72s: know exactly where it's going to go yet
435.36s: so volatility is
438.60s: 327 100% ivp so absolutely jacked jacked
442.64s: to the tits and the call and put volume
446.16s: in here is about even and I think this
448.64s: is people seeing this insane move and
451.60s: we're starting to see people stepping in
453.28s: front of it to take it to the downside
455.28s: because the reality here is that there's
458.00s: been no real fundamental change in the
460.80s: value of the company the profitability
463.04s: of the company what the company's doing
464.44s: so this is generally pure speculation
468.16s: and a proxy for an election outcome
471.04s: which we don't exactly know what that's
472.32s: going to look like just yet let's take a
474.12s: look at the um open interest for and
478.84s: yeah exactly so people are starting to
480.24s: play it more to the downside there's
481.92s: 68,000 puts 436 on the call side and I
485.40s: have to be honest even from my own
487.36s: perspective I'm getting to the point
489.24s: where I probably will look to reverse
491.00s: the position not all too late because
493.92s: there's also the unknown on how this is
495.80s: going to act if Trump wins which right
497.56s: now he's favored what this will look
499.56s: like and because even if he wins it
502.36s: doesn't magically make this company have
504.08s: different fundamentals I think right now
506.20s: this is truly behaving as a meme stock
507.96s: with a lot a lot of fervor behind it and
510.48s: it wouldn't surprise me to see people
512.00s: trying to short it here you can already
513.40s: see it's hard to borrow so we'll have to
515.16s: do a little bit of digging to see just
517.16s: what the internals of it look like but I
519.04s: mean another what almost 10% day 8 and
521.40s: 3/4 so massive massive move here so tons
524.52s: of opportunity literally options changed
526.56s: with
527.44s: 450% IV the only thing I would not is
529.76s: people are coming in here saying like oh
531.52s: I want to sell puts oh I want to sell
533.28s: calls the problem with selling options
536.52s: in something like this is you have to
537.92s: remember if you're selling puts or if
539.92s: you're selling calls those are still
542.28s: directional trades people have gotten
544.84s: way too used to the if IV is high sell
547.68s: if it's low buy there's still a Delta
550.08s: component to these trades so if this
552.48s: thing continues to move crazily it
554.16s: doesn't matter if IV is high it's pinned
555.88s: at 100 guess what it can stay there for
558.32s: a while when IV is that high it means
562.44s: the underlying is moving a lot which is
565.08s: not good for short single options with
567.56s: undefined risk so something to keep in
569.60s: mind as always if there's anything you
571.36s: need let me know be an outliner I'll see
572.92s: you later
