0.00s: Hey everybody, what's up? So I was fortunate enough to get Brent on and so he is a fascinating
11.72s: background, but first off, thank you for taking the time to, you know, hop on chat with me
16.16s: a little bit and share some your experience.
17.96s: Sure. Good to see you and there's definitely a good synergy between trading and people
23.76s: with military backgrounds. In fact, two of the best traders that, so I've had, I've been
27.84s: to manage her a lot at various banks and two of the best traders that ever worked for
31.76s: me were both military backgrounds. So not a coincidence. Yeah. It's, it makes sense to
37.60s: me in a lot of ways though, just because of the discipline. I think that that's such a
40.52s: big thing, which, you know, I think, yeah, I mean, there's a couple of things that the
46.04s: discipline and then also, I think the stakes don't feel as high. Like if you've been in
51.40s: the military and then you come to trading, it's like, yeah, okay, it's scary to, you know,
55.84s: whatever is going to happen to your P and L, but it's not comparable to real life, you
60.64s: know, military situations and the needless to say. And then also, maybe this is just more
67.40s: of like a quirk, but generally people that come to Wall Street from the military are older
72.36s: and more mature. So it's not like a 22 year old like Quant, who's, you know, never been
78.32s: out of their parents backyard in their life, you know, like so they're generally military
84.28s: people that come to Wall Street are just more, you know, adult. And I'm not saying that
89.92s: I was because I was very immature when I came to Wall Street, but, and so that was probably
94.80s: weakness in mind, but a lot of military people come, you know, as adults that are mature
99.60s: and, and kind of ready to sit down and get to work. So yeah, it's an interesting observation.
105.48s: So I, I do find that a lot just in terms of the scale of the perception of risk is really
112.52s: important because yeah, I think a lot of retail traders focus a lot on if they're actually
119.80s: developed for retail traders, they focus on risk a lot. But I think a lot of people forget
124.16s: the other side of that equation, you know, that reward is tied to risk. And a lot of people
128.04s: become really risk averse, then you can't really make any money if you're too risk averse.
133.80s: And yeah, that's interesting. I don't know if you want to get started, like go right into
137.16s: this or I'm like, I'm literally no format. So whatever.
140.72s: I don't know if I'm like hijacking your intro or whatever. But one interesting thing that
145.84s: I found is so like I'm a very risk loving person. Like I took a lot of stupid risks as
150.08s: a lesson and just like I've always been a risk taking person. And so that has generally
155.88s: for me been harnessed in trading by like rules and, and systems and things like that.
160.72s: Right. And so as a manager, when I was like 30 or so, I started managing people and
166.44s: I started managing more and more people. And the biggest surprise or one of the biggest
170.00s: surprises to me was how risk averse people actually are. And I kind of thought, oh, everyone
174.88s: must be like me. I'll just need these rules to like pull the reins back on everyone. And
179.64s: actually most of the guys that and I'm saying guys have not all men worked for me, but
184.24s: mostly men and some. But actually the women that work for me were more risk seeking. So
189.32s: whatever that means. But a lot of the guys that work for me, I had to actually institute
194.20s: rules to force them to take more risk because their risk would be their positions would be
199.60s: too small or they were always like there's two ways of being risk averse. One is your
203.64s: positions are too small and you can't pull the trigger. That's kind of like the textbook
207.92s: thing, right? Like I can't can't always waiting for the perfect trade and all that. Yeah.
213.24s: But then there's another form of it, which is people that put on risk, but then just always
217.84s: want to take it off. So like any excuse like, oh, the price action, you know, should have
221.76s: gone down by now and and that kind of like there's a lot of traders that will just make
225.56s: a million excuses because it's the having the risk that makes them nervous, not the putting
230.44s: it on. Right. I found that really interesting when I started becoming a manager on Wall
235.92s: Street was that actually 80% of people are risk averse. And what you really wanted was
242.08s: like the 22 year old analysts that came in and like where I was like, dude, you're taking
247.52s: way too much risk. This is insane. Like that's that was very rare. And that's what I was.
252.60s: So like, you know, you when you don't know the world that well, which I didn't, you just
257.08s: think everyone's kind of like you, but obviously that's not the case. So everyone, I think like
262.28s: a really important thing in this whole dialogue is being really self aware about what your
268.96s: thing is like, you know, you risk averse. Are you like, what are you going at and what
273.96s: are you not good at? And like for me, one big breakthrough I had was acknowledging. So
281.32s: like everyone wants to like get better, right? Like self improvement and that that sort
285.36s: of like the, the, the, sorry, like the growth mindset and all that is like, I'm not who
292.60s: I am now or I am now, but I can be anything through improvement and stuff. And I think
298.48s: that philosophy kind of like dominates education and a lot of trading education as well.
303.64s: But the reality is that some things you cannot change and that was actually a big breakthrough
308.88s: for me was instead of saying like, okay, tomorrow I'm going to be more disciplined. I'm
312.96s: definitely going to like follow my rules tomorrow was that mentality didn't work for me
318.40s: because the next day, like I'd make the same mistake again. Right. So the mentality actually
323.16s: that helped me a lot was, okay, my self discipline sucks like my or my self control sucks. So instead
331.12s: of trying to fix it, like now, whatever, like in those days, I was when I made this kind
336.20s: of leap or whatever, I was probably 30, 33 or something. I'm like, okay, I'm 33 years
340.48s: old. My self control still sucks. So what am I going to do about it? And then when I acknowledged
346.80s: it and then started putting in systems and, and like basically automating more of my risk
351.72s: management and stuff like that, that was like a big leap for me was like instead of putting
356.68s: that having the chips in the cupboard in the closet and saying like, okay, I'm definitely
361.64s: not going to eat the chips tonight. It's better to just not have the chips in the closet
365.64s: in the first or in the cupboard in the first place. You say cupboard or closet. I'm Canadian.
369.04s: Well, I was going to say you must be Canadian. So here, we, yeah, we would go with closet.
375.36s: If it's like a big one, a pantry is a big one. Yeah, maybe pantry was the word I was looking
380.24s: for. I mean, the other night I actually said, or I was in actually bored
386.64s: room. And I, you know, there's food there and I was getting a water. And I said, anybody
391.16s: want to pop and like the friggin silence in that room, holy crap. No, I'm trying to.
398.40s: I have a few mis midwest friends and they'll go with pop and it's always at least, I mean,
403.96s: these are friends I've been friends with for a decade. And I'll fight with them for
406.76s: 10 minutes every time pop is a sound pop is a noise. So I mean, I've been in the US since
412.32s: 2006. So I've like cleared most of these texts by now, but you know, they still sneak back.
418.00s: But anyways, I'll give you the mic back. But yeah, the whole, the whole spectrum of from
424.64s: like risk averse to risk seeking is really interesting. And I think like knowing your own
430.72s: place on that spectrum and trying to move to a more appropriate point on the spectrum,
435.92s: but then also knowing like there's only so far you can move yourself because you're
440.80s: fundamental like who you are is somewhat anchored, you know, like it's not completely, it's
446.32s: definitely not fixed. But it is somewhat anchored. And then so understanding that I think is useful.
454.24s: I absolutely agree with you. When you see me put my head down, I'm just taking some notes
457.60s: because I actually, I actually really want to talk about that risk for rewards spectrum a
462.32s: little bit later. So for general context, I want to talk a little bit about your
470.48s: background. So from my understanding, you started at Citibank at the FX desk. Yes.
479.76s: Yep, that's right. Yep. I started in 1995. 95, yeah. And then you worked at the spot desk for a bit.
488.08s: And then you decided that you were the next Steven Spielberg. So you wanted to go into film.
494.88s: Yeah. And then that had mixed outputs. So then it was a subsequent rotation
502.96s: back to floor trading. Good so far. Yeah, it wasn't really floor trading. It was more like
510.00s: the term people usually use as bucket shop, but it wasn't a bucket shop. It was like a professional
514.80s: day trading place. You know, that many of those existed in the late 1990s. Yeah. So I was kind of
521.68s: doing the creative thing, which the most like the peak of that success was like we had a cartoon
526.88s: on TV in Canada for like two years. Yeah, that's right. What was it called? Draft Planet?
531.60s: Yeah, that's right. Yeah. So I was doing that and trading the Nasdaq bubble at the same time.
537.76s: So yes, anyways, 100% accurate so far. All right. And I even got the cartoon name. I'm pretty
543.28s: so I'm pretty good research. I watched a couple episodes of it actually on YouTube. It's like,
548.88s: it's actually really good. I think that the timing was rough because I know that South Park was
556.72s: getting big in the mid 90s. And they did it. You know, they took a lot of limelight, but I like,
563.52s: I don't know the humor that you guys have in there is I think like really well, really well done.
568.00s: So it's actually the opposite. So South Park helped us because the sort of like
574.08s: way in animation in that time was basically like script and story over animation quality because
581.52s: South Park's animation quality was low like intentionally. The bar to make like a show wasn't as high.
588.72s: So like our our show was actually the first one the first animated TV show made in Flash like
594.32s: remember Flash. I don't know. Okay, Flash was like a program that was used mostly for online
600.40s: animation. Okay. And so our show was the first one is still like caustic 250 grand an episode,
605.36s: but that was cheap at the time for for a show. So yeah, but the business model generally in Canada
613.44s: for for a lot of artistic things is you got to sell it in the US within like a year or two because
618.80s: that's like really interesting. The economies of scale in the Canadian market being like one
623.60s: tenth the size of the US are right. Right. Like depending on what the thing is. And then when you
628.80s: release in the US, you get like the big marketing halo and all that because the US TV and rate like
634.96s: not radio now, but the TV and and print and all that like all kind of flows back into Canada. So
641.76s: so anyways, we never sold it in the US. So I'll let you continue. Interesting. Yeah, I mean,
646.64s: that's interesting background though. So then after that is when you said that you were trading the
653.52s: the NASDAQ bubble. Is that accurate? That's right. Yeah. Okay. And then you did some time in hedge funds
662.80s: after that mixed hedge funds. I know that you worked at a couple of places. You see and
668.24s: I think what city also or is that? Yes, I went back to city again. So basically what happened was
675.12s: like this is this is relevant to trading. So I'll tell you a little bit more detail was around like
683.60s: 2000 right around the cusp of when the bubble peak. I think like April 2000. I think it was a peak
688.88s: March April 2000. It was getting harder to do what I was doing, but it was still fine. So
695.12s: mostly my strategy was I had a in those days, you had a like the S&P pit was still a thing like
701.20s: the actual pit in or whatever. So I had a like a feed like a earphone, whatever to to guide
709.36s: the squawk from the pit. And you could kind of get an sense of like when S&Ps were bit and when
715.28s: they were heavy and all that. And then I had like eight stocks on my screen that were all like
720.56s: high absolute value stocks. So like stocks trading from 100 to $500 a share. And when you could feel
726.48s: like bullish energy in the pit in the S&Ps, you get on I get on the bid and all the stocks.
731.60s: So if it was 100 and some of them were trading pretty wide like 100 102 say like some of the
736.96s: the shitty tech stocks were trading. So I'd go at that time it was fraction. So I'd go 100 and
742.08s: one eighth bid. And there was enough retail back and forth. Sometimes you'd get filled, but in a
747.44s: in a moment where like S&Ps were kind of ticking higher. So you know, obviously that was a good
752.00s: time to be getting filled on the bid. And then you just try it off for the amount at 101 and 7 eighths
756.32s: right away. Got it. So part of that was every morning I printed a thing of all the stocks over
762.48s: 100 because that was kind of what was necessary because you didn't want to be trading a stock that
766.64s: was at like five bucks like Sun Microsystems or something because you had to do so many shares,
771.68s: you know, when the spreads were smaller. What you want is like absolute value and low volume because
776.48s: the commission was the was a big thing in those days. So like it was a much easier to be gross
782.56s: positive, but obviously you had to be net positive. So you wanted to pay as little bro as you could
786.96s: in those days. It actually mattered a lot. So anyway, just sorry, just to curiosity, what kind of
792.96s: leverage were you using if you were I mean you're taking for what like a point ride or something
796.40s: like that? Yeah. So like not very much like I open my account with 25 grand and I think we only
803.36s: had two to one at two to one margin. I'm pretty sure. Oh, okay. So yeah, interesting. So yeah, so
811.92s: in the morning, I would print out a sheet of all the stocks over 100 and it was like four pages long
816.56s: and so in 02, this is when when things started going pear shaped for me, when I printed that
822.08s: thing out in the morning, there was four stocks on it. So like the absolute value of the stocks
826.56s: had collapsed. So my churn rate was going up a lot. So every day, I'd still be gross positive,
832.80s: but a lot of days now I was net negative because of the brokerage. So I would make four grand,
837.44s: like say I'd make a 3,800 bucks and my commission would be 4,200 or whatever. And you know,
842.64s: that's a lot of work to make. You know, I don't know if those numbers are not that's probably on
846.40s: the high side, but you know, but some days I'd make, you know, whatever. Anyway, so I was kind of like,
852.56s: it was getting more and more difficult to make money. And then what killed me was decimalization came
858.00s: in at that time as well. And then all the spreads just went like after that. So like things that were
864.40s: traded two bucks wide were now like there was all these little shitty bids and offers in there
869.60s: on all the pennies. So it was a really good lesson for my like broader career. So basically like I
877.76s: took my account from like 25 grand to three to 350,000. And like I made way more than that because I
884.56s: paid my taxes. I bought like an M3 out of that. I paid my rent for I was out of like I was doing
890.00s: that basically for five years, except the TV show I got paid a little bit. So like I did really well,
897.60s: but then starting with basically the day decimalization happened. I never adopted and I never really
905.04s: found a new way to trade. And so my equity started going the like slowly, slowly down. And I was just
912.40s: basically bleeding every day. And I could kind of feel like, okay, this isn't happening anymore.
916.56s: Like I don't know what I'm I don't know how to make money anymore. So and it coincided a whole
922.64s: bunch of things happened. So the show got canceled right around that same time as decimalization. And
928.08s: then I met my wife. So I was like, I kind of wouldn't mind having like a real job now. Like I've
932.24s: been partying and trading for five years. It's kind of like I'm to be an adult. And also I'd been out
939.04s: for almost five years. So I thought like if I'm I still had people that I knew that I had worked
943.04s: with and stuff. So it's like if someone wants to hire me, you know, after five years, that's going
947.52s: to be a miracle. But like after seven or eight years, people are just going to say like, dude,
951.52s: you've been gone too long. Nobody knows who you are. Right. So I decided at that time to then go back
958.56s: into into trading. So back into FX trading. But the reason that I left part of the reason I left
965.12s: originally was Mark making was 100% flow in the 90s. It was just like super transactional.
971.76s: So 100 by 50 and basically you're just trying to keep track of your position and like take all the
977.44s: crumbs and make 100 grand and be happy. And now so like now fast forward to 2022. Almost all the
986.00s: market making is automated. Like especially in what I do, which is spot FX is the most commoditized
991.12s: of all the it's one of the most commoditized products really in the world. Most liquid and
995.60s: commoditized products even more than like probably Apple stock. So but actually what that opened up
1002.00s: was a lot of opportunities for the job to be a lot more interesting. So now the job is much more
1008.00s: about like talking to clients, almost acting like a consultant. And then also writing about macro and
1014.88s: being more strategic, trying to take positions and like forecast the market and like kind of what I
1020.88s: always thought trading really was as opposed to what market making is, which is executing transactions
1027.04s: for external counter parties, which wasn't I didn't never found very much fun. But the downside of
1033.68s: that is that like when I started at city in 1995, the spot spot is like you know two day settlement
1041.52s: currency trades. So normal currency trades that people think of like you know I'm buying
1045.36s: Euro, I'm selling dollar yen or whatever, that's spot. And the spot desk at city New York was 30
1051.36s: people when I started. And now like most spot desks are three three people because computers can
1057.76s: do most almost all the trades. So you as a market maker and FX now, you basically do like the huge
1064.56s: trades. And you you know take risk based on what you think's going to happen like based on where
1069.84s: you think the market's going. And then you talk to clients and it's so it's more of like almost like
1074.08s: a hybrid like what I've developed into is more like a hybrid sales trading and research kind of like
1082.32s: I don't know I was going to say triple threat, but that sounds way too.
1086.24s: Sounds very sexy. Yeah way too sexy way more sexy than I am. So but like you know I think that's
1093.76s: that's kind of like the people that work at banks that are that are succeeding now on desks.
1100.64s: A lot of them are doing that more like more hybrid role where you're talking to clients and
1105.20s: taking risk, but then also doing more like researchy kind of stuff. And then some actually doing
1111.52s: quant stuff as well, which that's not really my area. Like I'm I'm functional in next cell and
1117.20s: stuff, but I'm not like applied math guy. Got it. Yeah, I've had a couple people that I've worked with
1124.72s: and actually my best friend is kind of a super nerd when it comes to excel and sometimes I feel
1131.20s: proficient, but then I do stuff around them and then I just feel like an idiot. So yeah,
1135.52s: yeah, like when the V lookups not doing what you wanted it to do and you're like yeah,
1140.24s: I can't read that like the first first class, but you know, you don't have to worry about it because
1146.32s: there's some six year old on YouTube that can walk you right through it. Yeah, true. And then you just
1151.68s: said this kid is in middle school. I just cut and based his code straight in Excel.
1159.92s: So one of my main questions, I think I was telling you before we started. I did trade some
1166.32s: effects when I was in college. So I started trading when I was in high school, but it was mostly just
1172.56s: stock. And then I you because I didn't have any money as like $35,000, $325,000 not $35,000.
1180.56s: $35,000 in high school would have been sick. But anyways, you know, I didn't have much money.
1186.48s: And then in college, I came across effects. And for a while, effects was at least on the retail
1192.40s: side was was kind of a big deal because it seemed like there was this thought that it was fast easy
1198.80s: money. That was like the general messaging around it. And you know, I thought fast easy money,
1205.20s: that sounds that sounds like me. And then I realized it was like, you know, lose your money
1213.44s: fast and easy was probably a better yeah, moniker for it because I was trading it for a little bit.
1219.68s: I had moderate success at best. And it was not worth the time, you know, for what what I was
1226.40s: trying to get out of it. And I would love to know other than you just starting in, you know,
1232.24s: effects when you first kind of got into the markets. What's kept you there? Why effects? Why not
1237.36s: futures on equities? Why not other products? What's kept you there? Well, so my kind of like
1245.04s: interest was always more macro than micro like terms of economics and all that. I wouldn't say
1251.60s: that like I was super thoughtful and strategic about what I ended up. I was like 22 and I kind of
1256.32s: ended up in effects. Something like not totally randomly, but kind of like I had a couple choices
1261.92s: and I picked it. And but the reason that it appeals to me is that there's so many like there's
1268.96s: just this constant ebb and flow of new narratives like a lot of what I do is kind of around narrative
1274.16s: sentiment positioning, trying to understand like kind of what the crowd's doing and then
1280.08s: being ahead of it. And you know, I have more of an edge in that now than I used to because like I
1285.76s: just because I know a lot of people and I talk to a lot of people. But even when I was starting out,
1290.40s: I think I always like the macro like the kind of like on like unchanged or sorry continuously changing
1297.44s: narratives like this crazy puzzle that's so complex that it can never be solved. And like just when
1304.32s: you think you've solved it, the older rules change and those things you thought matter don't even
1309.12s: matter. Whereas like to me like DCF and 10Ks and stuff like that never really appealed to me as much
1317.76s: because I'm just more into like macro and behavioral stuff. So like I think and then
1324.96s: like the approach that I use in terms of like behavioral stuff, I think would work like works
1330.96s: across asset classes. But generally I think it's so hard to make money trading that you really
1337.28s: just have to like become expert on your thing. And like you can understand and watch other things and
1342.88s: maybe incorporate other asset classes into your into your framework. But I feel like so like my
1349.36s: my guess would be that like if you're succeeding in what you're doing now in equities, if you had devoted
1354.32s: the same amount of time to FX, you probably would have found your niche, you know what I mean? Like I
1359.36s: don't think there is some aspect like I've described my kind of interest in economics and stuff
1366.16s: was always more macro. So I think my personality is more like I'm more likely to enjoy myself doing
1372.24s: FX than than doing like small caps just because it's more macro. But at the same time, you know, like
1380.08s: does that mean there's more like a greater chance I'd have an edge in it? I don't really think so.
1384.56s: Like if I spent 10 years trading small caps, I think I could probably figure out my edge and it
1389.84s: probably be something kind of different and maybe not as behavioral. But I think that's why I'm
1394.40s: a big proponent of really like picking a thing and saying, okay, like I'm going to be as expert as
1399.76s: I possibly can at this. And like I said, it doesn't preclude you from looking at other stuff for
1404.64s: trading other stuff. But yeah, like so the question I guess is like, can people have an edge in FX?
1414.56s: I think generally, first of all, having an edge in any product is extremely difficult and there's
1421.20s: so much empirical data that supports that. You know, what day traders and equities are FX or whatever,
1426.72s: the success rate is very low. But the upside is huge. So like not just financially, but also
1433.68s: like quality of life and enjoyment, you know, like I have some stuff that I've written in my book about
1439.84s: like the relationship between money and happiness and everyone has their own curve and all that.
1444.88s: And my curve's pretty flat. Like, you know, making more money doesn't really make me happier.
1450.88s: But I still love trading and I love writing about trading just because it's like a,
1455.04s: it's an interesting puzzle that's constantly telling me that it's fun. And like I guess the money is
1460.08s: is like a measuring rod or whatever, like a video game has a score and trading can sometimes
1466.72s: be like that. But then also like it is still real, you know, like it's not like a video game because
1474.80s: it's connected to the real world in different ways. Although less connected than it used to be, I
1479.04s: guess, like financial markets in the real world have been drifting apart for the last 15 years. So
1486.16s: yeah. Now, one of the things I'm curious about, again, just kind of from a selfish perspective
1492.00s: in my own curiosity. Yeah. So when I was trading FX, it felt like longer time frames were very
1500.80s: difficult for me to align with to figure out where things were most likely to go. I'm sure it's
1508.96s: a good amount of experience that I was missing for that. But I what led me closer to equities was it
1516.00s: felt more forgiving where things I could swing trade or even trade, you know, like I like to trade
1523.92s: options like I was telling you, so I'll have leaps diagonals on that I managed in six to nine
1529.84s: months. And I've had pretty good success with those kinds of things. In FX, I felt like I could never
1537.36s: find that. So I would be curious just to understand your perspective on time frames that you would
1545.36s: think more people could be successful in if they were trading FX or even from your own experience,
1550.64s: like what time frames you prefer the most? Yeah. So my time frame is much shorter.
1556.96s: And like time frame is a really important question. Like part of it is personality. So
1562.80s: if you're not like if you're a patient person who like tends to over, sorry, inpatient person who
1568.48s: tends to over trade, you know, like that's going to be obviously more suited to shorter time horizons.
1574.56s: And then if you're like sort of like a patient mature wise person, like you are, that it sounds
1580.32s: like then your longer time frame would be true. Well, like I don't know, you found your way.
1585.60s: And I get it holding on to things and stuff. Then a longer time frame works. I think philosophically
1593.20s: for me. So generally like my average holding period is about two days. But it varies from like one
1599.92s: hour to two months. Like it's that one. And mostly if I'm doing longer stuff, it's through options.
1607.76s: But a lot of it has to do with like understanding what is signal and what's noise on your specific
1614.08s: time horizon. So like people have these macro views like, oh, the, you know, Russia sanctions mean
1621.04s: China's going to switch out of dot treasuries into gold. So I'm going to be long gold. But then
1625.84s: their stop is like four percent below the market or whatever. And like so that would be a timing
1630.00s: mismatch of like a super macro trade with a stop loss like 1.5 days ranges away. Right. So I think
1637.68s: that's a mistake that a lot of people make is the combination of like leverage, tightness of stop,
1644.32s: and like trying to make X amount of money or whatever doesn't always fit with the with the thesis or
1649.84s: the time horizon that they're trading. But generally, I find and so this is just like a philosophical
1657.28s: thing to me. But when you think about something like a very, very complex system like markets or like
1664.80s: weather or whatever, I feel like the more you go out and like it's interesting because this obviously
1671.20s: isn't consistent with your your experience. But my experience is that like sometimes I feel like I
1678.64s: can basically see what's going to happen before it's happening for like a day or two. And then I
1683.28s: try to hold on to it for another day and another day and then I end up giving the whole thing back.
1688.32s: So whatever it is that I have that where I can like see like I feel like I can see the future
1694.48s: because of probably pattern recognition and stuff like that. It seems to dissipate after about
1700.64s: two days. And like my I keep a lot of data on my trading data on my trading and it supports that as
1707.28s: well. And actually just one takeaway for people watching is if you keep data on your trading,
1715.60s: you'll learn 80% of the stuff you you find in the data will be like yeah I knew that I lose
1720.96s: money in the afternoons or whatever. But there'll be a few nuggets in there where you're like whoa
1725.92s: like I didn't know that like I had no idea. And actually I said the losing money in the afternoons
1729.84s: thing. So when I worked I worked at a hedge fund for a few years and I used to snap my P&L every
1735.36s: 30 minutes. And FX is very busy when London's in and then it tends to fizzle after that. So 7am
1742.80s: or really like 6am New York till 11am is like the good time to trade FX. And like everyone knows that
1749.20s: and you know I knew that I probably shouldn't trade in the afternoon. But then I started snapping my
1753.92s: P&L every 30 minutes. And basically like if you just normalize it to like maximum P&L like this is
1761.04s: starting P&L then that's maximum. The maximum was at 11 and then I was losing between 11 and 5pm.
1766.96s: I was losing about 35% of my P&L like on average. So like yeah I knew that afternoons weren't great
1772.80s: to trade. But then when I saw that I'm like that's like a lot of money you know you know you had a
1777.52s: percentage at a hedge fund. So that's like real money that's you know it registered for the first
1784.32s: time in my mind like okay I really have to like pretty much square up at 11 or like reduce my
1789.92s: position, reduce my risk to 20% of what it was or whatever. And so very like a specific I mean
1797.44s: that's a pretty specific thing that I learned. But whatever data people can keep like a journal like
1805.04s: in is generally people think of a trading journal as like words and thoughts and all that. But also
1811.04s: like keeping like I got in at this time out at this time depends on your frequency like if you're
1816.08s: doing 200 trades a day then that's not realistic and then your data has to be on a like your granularity
1822.64s: has to be daily levels. But if you're doing like four trades a day you can keep track pretty specifically
1828.08s: and then you can start to see and you can start to get information about like oh whenever I do options
1834.48s: beyond a month. Like so that's one one thing I started noticing was like I used to do a lot of
1839.60s: options that were pretty short. And I noticed like one week options at the end of the year one
1845.36s: week options were making me a lot of money and overnight options were were killing like we're
1850.16s: super negative. And there's kind of like a reason for that in the market in FX like this is boring
1856.00s: so I won't get into it. But generally overnight options are very expensive because nobody wants to sell
1860.56s: them. Yeah. Well the same thing in equities right as you as you get to like the stupid short time
1865.20s: horizons nobody wants to sell that thing because the leverage is too crazy. So if you're systematically
1870.80s: buying those things you're losing money. So I would just encourage your your peeps to just keep
1876.88s: as detailed as as within reason. Yeah. And so the interesting thing is like just sit there and
1883.60s: collect it for three months. And then after three months or whatever go look at it and go like okay what
1889.84s: you know what can I learn here you don't have to constantly be checking back on it like most of my
1894.88s: trick most of my data I just have it in a sheet and like I look at it once a quarter and I go
1899.84s: because especially now I kind of know what it's going to say. But then sometimes you're like oh wow
1904.80s: I'm surprised like you know like every single option I did like this quarter lost money and all
1910.72s: my spot trades made money like sometimes it's even something that obviously you don't realize so.
1915.76s: Well and I feel like there's a ton of value in that. I actually do a segment right now it's called
1920.16s: teaching to trade. I like took four random people from my audience and we meet each week and we
1925.36s: record sessions together essentially just about like learning our skillset together. Okay. And one
1930.32s: of the big things is trade logs. I'm a huge advocate of trade documentation and especially when I
1937.76s: think people are early on in their journey it even starts to give you information in terms of like
1942.96s: what's important to track. And then over time you can cut out thing like you know for options.
1948.96s: I originally tracked all of the first order and second order Greeks. Super overkill did not
1955.84s: need to happen and I don't do that anymore but now I know that if I'm trading you know two week
1960.64s: options row doesn't really matter that much however for really long term stuff especially during
1966.56s: a year like this when interest rates are moving rows now important and we know that you know from
1971.68s: reviewing that kind of data. So yeah I love that you mentioned that especially because I do feel like
1977.44s: there's such a paradox with retail trading it's so easy to enter now even Robin Hood you know they
1984.00s: like game apply it's literally a game now. Yeah yeah and it's just a lot of people feel like well you
1988.96s: could just walk onto the field and play this game and be successful and you know as you right
1994.32s: fully pointed out it's statistically speaking like literally not the case it's just not how this
1999.60s: works. I my my mate like I have two books about my first one's just about FX trading and my second
2006.24s: one's more about trading in general but in the first couple chapters of that book I kind of go into
2011.36s: like success rates and like what it takes to succeed and all that kind of stuff in trading and the
2018.00s: the thing about trading is that it's like online poker or like professional poker like anyone can
2024.16s: go sit down right but like I think it's really important to understand like not necessarily on day one
2031.04s: like nobody has an edge on day one. But to like be kind of looking at like okay what's my edge
2036.88s: going to be because there's a lot of like I don't want to say like get rich quick but I guess
2042.96s: that's what it is right it's get rich quick kind of mentality of like technical formations that are
2049.36s: generally like what a lot of companies will do is like backtest a bunch of things find some things
2054.40s: that work and then market the success rate of those things but out of sample they don't work they
2059.04s: just worked you know it's data mining kind of thing and so like there is in my opinion and I can
2066.08s: pretty much say this like with 100% certainty there's no easy way to trade like there's no like you
2071.44s: draw a line on a thing and when it breaks you sell it and then you make money. If that was a thing
2077.92s: first of all like that it isn't a thing but if it was there be computers doing it and there are
2083.76s: computers doing it you know so like the simplest the very simplest things don't exist as
2091.20s: profitable like alpha generating strategies. Yeah but the thing is though also is that I don't feel
2096.96s: like the level of complexity has to be like insanely higher either like a simple strategy of
2103.92s: trying to determine when people are panicking and doing the opposite like that's kind of what
2108.48s: Renaissance technologies did for a long time right is just finding like a basic inefficiency in
2113.84s: the market and then trying to capitalize on it so like there used to be things like sometimes headlines
2119.52s: used to be like that right is just there's an eight there's like a equilibrium asymmetry where for
2125.68s: 15 seconds a headline comes out and the price discovery happens and if you're really fast like
2130.88s: that was one of the things I did in 99 in the 90s was I was just really fast because I played a lot of
2135.84s: video games and so something came out and I just have a man and then I was I was out as the other
2141.92s: people were trying to buy on the headline that were slow you know I mean I was selling to those
2145.60s: right so that can be like an edge can be that simple but like having some understanding of like why
2155.04s: should you be able to make money is and sometimes I think you can figure it out right like somebody
2160.08s: notices like oh these spacks are mispriced or like they you know they'll win the lockup happens on
2166.88s: these IPOs there's a two-week window where the stock goes down and like that's a violation of
2172.48s: efficient markets but the flow is bigger than the buy and nobody's buying for those two weeks and
2178.32s: so like there's to me there's like the market is extremely efficient on like most time frames but
2186.40s: there's all these millions of little inefficiencies constantly happening and if you're good you
2192.00s: you're not really like you don't have to be some like George Soros macro genius
2197.12s: Sevan you just find these like if you become really good at your thing your currency or your
2203.44s: whatever your stock you start to see little inefficiencies are like oh if you have level two like
2209.04s: when this person's buying you know it always seems to tick like 30 30 cents higher what are you to
2214.00s: start seeing patterns and so my point my original point was that there's a lot of marketing and stuff
2222.32s: of like super simple methodologies usually involving charts and texts and breakouts and stuff
2228.64s: like that and they don't work so I'm just telling people don't do that because it's it like and
2235.20s: you're better off I think you said actually in the video that I was just watching before
2239.92s: like don't spend your money on that thing put like if you're going to spend 15 grand on a course
2244.80s: or whatever put like five grand in a in a trading account and buy like a thousand dollars with the
2250.96s: books and read all those books and you'll get way more out of it a lot of the like courses and stuff
2256.64s: or you were talking about discord yeah but like there's you know there's there's definitely very good
2262.88s: products out there but in general I think like you can probably have just as good odds teaching
2269.52s: yourself because the incentives are aligned when you're teaching yourself and if you're buying a
2274.40s: course that it's not guaranteed that the incentives are aligned but anyways I didn't mean to come on
2278.40s: here and talk about trading courses but no I again literally that's why I love these conversations
2284.56s: they go wherever they go and I think there's like goodness like literally in all of that because
2289.76s: one of my my biggest heartaches is a lot of these courses that are marketing and you know I always
2296.96s: find it to be so important to like work backwards from an entity and understand the incentive
2302.40s: if I am a trading course what is my larger audience treating like preaching a really hard long
2311.44s: process to be profitable or this two simple strategies that works 80% of the time right right
2318.48s: you know what I mean it's like it's inherent in the way that the marketing works and
2323.52s: that's actually I've started a bit of a crusade against win rate and everybody wants to talk about
2330.00s: win rate and probability of profit which I like but it's something that my mentor actually drilled
2335.60s: into my head early on is expectancy expectancy you can have a very low win rate not very low it's
2342.56s: thought to win sometimes but you can have a low relatively low win rate but still be profitable
2347.68s: it's an extreme example but the point being there's two parts to this equation that matter you
2352.96s: can also have a 95% win rate that's not profitable and that like that doesn't sell well you know
2359.76s: even the idea of expectancy that's an interesting thing that came out of so like in I I started
2365.68s: keeping real data all the time after I read this book by Ken Grant called trading risk
2372.00s: yeah I read it one of the few like really good risk management books but um so I had already been
2377.36s: trading for like 10 years at that point and I never had kept data before and that was one thing
2381.68s: that really surprised me was I was keeping data mostly most of my data that I keep is just daily
2386.96s: like so I just keep track of my like yeah up up down high low the day and all that and my win rate
2392.72s: is basically always between like 50 and 53% and then my P&L is all based on the ratio like is
2401.36s: at 1.71 or like you know in a really bad year it could be like based you wear your flat it'd be
2406.64s: obviously 1 to 1 and 50% kind of thing but the thing that I that so like there's the two levers
2412.16s: like you said right there's win percentage and there's the ratio up to down and I always found
2418.88s: any kind of tweaks and stuff that I did there I could never really change my win percentage
2423.52s: the everything was always more to do with you know like running winners and yes stops and all that
2429.52s: all influences this thing but win percentage is just like your edge and your edge is like
2438.48s: kind of goes up and down but doesn't go up and down all that much the edge comes from
2443.04s: or your your prediction capability or whatever your edge comes from monetizing the good ideas
2448.80s: and getting out of the bad ideas I know that's kind of like it's a truism it's kind of like
2453.60s: mathematical common sense but it's interesting to see it because like I think I would have
2458.00s: gas probably because like everyone out probably overestimates their skill as well I probably
2462.72s: would have guessed my win rate win rate was like 60% or something and then knowing it was only 50%
2467.84s: and how stable it was after year after year after like five years I'm like my win percentage doesn't
2472.72s: even move basically and some years I'm making tons in one year I was flat so I found that really
2478.56s: interesting and then you know it kind of changes your focus a little bit on like where do you
2482.24s: want to put your energy and obviously the energy should be devoted in more like not cutting too
2488.96s: early and things like that you know yeah I'm kind of a big nerd when it comes to reading white
2495.52s: papers and studies on retail trading and like Barber and Odin they do a bunch so I read their
2502.96s: stuff all the time they're from Berkeley and they do you know just all different kinds of studies
2508.72s: one of the really normal effects for retail traders is we tend to let losers run and we cut winners
2515.68s: too short and I think that feeds right into kind of the broader conversation around why high win rates
2523.28s: are so appealing is there's just there's a lot of ego involved in this space for a lot of people
2528.24s: until they learn that like ego loses money as soon as like I feel like a retail trader gets to
2533.68s: that conclusion you're so much better off but early on you know you don't want to admit you're
2539.44s: wrong and when you do have a trade that's winning even if it's just a little bit that's a winner
2544.00s: that feels good yeah you're like sweet yeah we want to take that down but then there goes
2548.56s: expectancy you know letting losers run cutting winner short equals negative expectancy yeah
2556.00s: so we have about 10 minutes left and we we were this is like literally the same conversation but I
2561.36s: do want to get your like explicit thoughts on it when we're thinking about the risk to reward spectrum
2567.68s: for retail traders before you know we were discussing that there's a you know a bit of a scale
2572.32s: and it's important to figure out where we are on that scale as individuals there's kind of two
2576.96s: questions I have for you for retail traders that are watching this how would they best determine where
2583.60s: on that scale they are and then based on where they are in that scale what kind of adjustments would
2590.16s: you be making if you were in their shoes let's say if they're low risk low return high risk high
2595.52s: return and then in the middle you know just for like some perspective ideas so I think interestingly
2602.64s: well I hope the sort of the solutions for both ends of the spectrum are really about having
2613.84s: some kind of rules based approach that is consistent and the good thing about having rules too
2620.40s: is that you know like if you if you're doing well it makes it less likely that it's luck
2627.68s: because it's repeatable right you're not just like coming in and hitting buttons and like oh I made
2631.52s: money six days in a row well it doesn't really mean anything because you might blow up on day seven
2636.32s: what if you have like a systematic approach so I think in general whether you're like
2641.68s: the I know the first part of the question was like how do you know I think most people just know
2646.80s: like I think in general you know if you first of all you need to know basically what your risk
2654.96s: management strategy is like what percentage of capital are you risking on your trades and
2659.84s: that kind of stuff like you need a basic here's my framework and here's my spreadsheet and if I
2665.12s: lose money 10 days in a row here's what's going to happen think you everyone has to have that
2671.12s: and then the question just becomes like are you pushing against the edge of that every single day
2677.60s: or are you like say you're let just for whatever just pick whatever number but like say your max loss
2684.16s: let's say at a bank so say I have a trade that's working for me and she's not supposed to lose more
2688.56s: than 50 grand a day and she's losing like 15 and then nine and 16 and stuff then I'm like okay dude
2696.56s: you're not like you should be hitting your limit once in a while very rarely but you should be
2700.56s: hitting it and then the other person is like hitting it four times a week that's obviously the other
2706.96s: the the other extreme so I think what you do is like you establish your bound your boundaries right
2713.60s: whatever like my max loss like you know what my good day is going to be relevant to my bad day
2720.56s: and then you start to see like how often am I testing that and like if you have say like a retail
2726.16s: trader and again I don't want to get into the nuances of like percent of risk per trade and all
2732.08s: that it's just such too long a conversation but let's just say let's say you have a hundred grand in
2735.92s: your account and every trade you do you're risking two grand that's like a simple methodology
2740.88s: then if you're losing four grand once a week like obviously that's a risk management problem but
2747.44s: if you're losing like 800 600 and 200 and like you know barely ever losing more than a thousand
2755.20s: then you're probably not maximizing like and you're doing okay you're probably not maximizing
2759.60s: your your upside because you're not you're not touching the guardrails at all so like I think having
2765.52s: like a really clear idea in your mind okay these are this is what like if I'm doing well this is
2770.80s: what it's going to look like and you can do simulations and stuff like that too like I've changed capital
2777.12s: amounts like crazy like I you know I was trading my own money I was trading a hedge fund with like
2781.28s: hundreds of million dollars of millions of dollars and then at a bank where different banks have
2785.76s: different risk sources so I've had like wildly different amounts of risk so each time I kind of
2792.08s: always establish like okay like a bad day is this a good day is this max bad day is this and then
2799.04s: on a weekly monthly basis kind of looks like this and I know I make money like 50% of days and you
2804.88s: can start to build little spreadsheets that kind of do like simulations and then kind of get an idea
2810.72s: of like okay you know we're also reverse engineering targets and reverse engineering like okay I'm
2816.64s: bankrupt if this happens you can start to get an idea of your like daily guardrails and and and
2823.20s: weekly and I think what you want to do is occasionally be testing those bounds on the really when you
2828.96s: have a really bad run you should be getting close to whatever the like worst case for that say
2834.16s: your weekly loss limit is and then to me though it's all about rules so like whether you work at a
2841.36s: bank or for yourself or whatever to me and the scary times for me have always been when I'm not
2846.40s: following my own rules because they need to really know what's going to happen because you're
2850.40s: you're the one pushing the buttons and you don't even know if you're going to stop or not to me
2854.32s: that's like being in that position is scary and to avoid that what I've always done like for many
2861.44s: years is every time I put a position on because my like I was saying at the start like myself control
2867.44s: discipline has never been that great is I automate everything so like you know I buy 10 million
2873.04s: euros it the soon as I do that I just put a stop lot wherever my stop is I put it on a computer
2878.64s: because like in FX you can automate everything I'm most yeah yeah and I usually always almost
2884.32s: always put my take profit as well yeah and then I try my hardest to not touch it and you know and I
2891.60s: I'm pretty good now because a lot more steps are required to like actively cancel a stop move it
2897.76s: down and all that but what if you don't have it automated it's it doesn't require that much effort
2902.72s: to go uh what was that 90 let me just move I'll stop at an 80 you know what it looks kind of bit
2908.00s: here I'll just wait till it gets to 70 and then all of a sudden like you're selling at 52 on the
2912.80s: way yeah so um whereas if you have a thing in a system to go in and actually change it requires a
2920.00s: lot more active engagement so um yeah so all of that to say I think like you develop your kind of like
2927.76s: range hopefully you're touching both sides of that range occasionally um and like you have a good
2933.68s: understanding of what your standard deviation is in that range and then it's all rules based and
2939.76s: there's no like there's no oops factor because everything you're doing has like a pretty simple set
2945.52s: of rules and there's a spreadsheet and yeah formatting like for when you break your limit it turns
2951.04s: red and you don't have too many red cells on the spreadsheet yeah I I love that it's actually one
2957.76s: of the things I'm doing with that teaching to trade segment right now is is having conversations
2962.48s: with them about creating those rules that's actually a fun follow on obviously we don't have time
2967.12s: to discuss it too far in this this call I'd love to talk to you another time about it though because
2971.20s: I find for newer traders um especially the four that I'm working with right now they have a hard time
2978.80s: um well let's take a step back most retail traders have no rules for themselves it's Lord of the
2983.68s: Flies so for the smaller subset that does acknowledge that rules are helpful structure serves them well
2990.72s: it gives them something to make adjustments off of in a quantitative manner so some of them have
2995.92s: a hard time even understanding where to make a rule right if you don't know what you don't know
3001.04s: and that's actually what I'm working a lot with them on right now um so like I said definitely
3006.16s: would be fun to pick your brain on that in in the future but I think one of the most important things
3010.80s: that I really want to echo that you mentioned is you know as we were talking about this risk
3015.28s: to reward spectrum you were talking about having some spreadsheets that you can review and I think
3023.12s: for most people have a hard time understanding the right risk of reward for themselves that's
3026.88s: the first place to start is logging having data to look at because otherwise how could you possibly
3033.04s: make any decisions and so like I don't I don't mean to make this sound like super complex either
3039.20s: essentially it's it's not like what I do isn't very complicated it's just based I think the the
3046.24s: number one reason you have to have some rules about like max daily loss and all that is that
3052.32s: you're gonna blow up otherwise like you know eventually you you know you take your account from
3057.68s: 30 grand to 200 grand and like I saw people do this and you don't have any guardrails and you go
3065.20s: from 200 to 100 and then you're like oh well like now like I've already lost 100 I might as well
3070.88s: just let it ride and then all of a sudden you're like you owe the firm 28 grand because you busted
3075.84s: your margin or whatever so like and also it gives you control of your drawdowns so that like you
3082.80s: don't go from 30k to 200k to 30k because that's obviously a common pattern as well is that like
3089.28s: you really shouldn't be drawing down you know whatever that is 86% of your of your capital at
3097.68s: any time so just having like a super basic rule of like you know 10% from peak I cut or whatever
3104.56s: like any and basically one rule that's gonna stop you from blowing up is like the starting point
3110.48s: and then you can layer on more a little bit more complexity but there's a there's a lot of
3115.52s: interesting things like I know it's kind of time to go but like even keeping the track of your high
3120.56s: and low like if you're kind of like an intraday trader your time horizon this might not work but
3125.60s: for people that are trading more like intraday just keeping track of your low day and high of day
3130.32s: sometimes you might notice like oh I whenever I get to 2 grand I always like shit the bed and end
3135.76s: up flat you know and that there's a lot of people have that as well like yeah because I think
3140.32s: they have house money yeah so it's house money effect and then it's also partly
3146.08s: of a math amount I've noticed this in effects it's a mathematical output of how big your positions are
3152.88s: and how volatile the instrument that you trade is is that if you you know if you're taking 10 million
3158.00s: dollar positions and your thing moves 1% a day you're gonna start to notice like whenever you're
3163.28s: up 100 grand that you tend to peak out because your product mean reverts at that point
3168.24s: right and your P&L is showing you that so anyways there's a lot of ways you can you can extract
3174.16s: information from the data but like just keeping a simple open high low close of your P&L I think
3180.32s: is like a super easy way to start I love that and that's literally a perfect note to end on I think
3186.16s: that's a great great piece of advice so first off on behalf of you know myself and everybody
3191.68s: looks let's watch and think you you know for taking some time to you know just bullshit with me
3195.76s: talk about trading a little bit I always find these conversations I enjoy them I get to learn and
3201.36s: I think that a lot of other people get to pick up you know different skills here and there so
3205.04s: thank you for sharing some of your experience with us you're welcome yeah I'm happy to do it
3209.20s: awesome brother well love to have you on again in the future and until next time
3213.20s: and see you later all right
