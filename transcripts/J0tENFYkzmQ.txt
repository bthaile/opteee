0.00s: One of the easiest ways to spot some sort of grifter,
4.00s: shell, bullshed artist is if they're talking about trading
8.00s: and they're just talking about their wins.
10.00s: Or if they talk about the dollar sizes of their wins.
13.00s: For anybody that's been in trading any duration of time,
16.00s: the topic we will talk about the most are the losses.
20.00s: And it's because for most of us as traders,
22.00s: we love winning, we love making money,
24.00s: but the losses are really interesting because they identify gaps
28.00s: in our process problems with what we're doing.
30.00s: And we all know that they're there
32.00s: and we share those to help each other get better.
36.00s: So if you're listening to somebody
38.00s: only talking about how they're making $5,000
40.00s: in 14 milliseconds,
42.00s: it's just bullshit.
44.00s: That's not to say that you can't make a lot of money fast
46.00s: because you can, but for the people that focus on that,
50.00s: they typically have some bullshit to sell you.
