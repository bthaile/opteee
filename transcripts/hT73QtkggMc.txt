0.00s: U.S. guy answers, shout out to Ben for this question.
3.80s: He says, why won't my order execute in regards to the whole trying to close the entire
11.12s: trade at once instead of closing one side at a time?
15.00s: It's a great question.
16.28s: And if it's everything to do with liquidity.
18.92s: So here's what happens.
20.28s: If you have multiple legs to your strategy, that's on.
24.80s: Like one, like two, maybe like three and four.
28.80s: What ends up happening?
30.12s: Is if I want to close this trade quickly, I can try to submit in order for all of these.
37.24s: Now, what that requires is a counter party that is looking for all of these at whatever
44.96s: price we pick, maybe 50 cents.
48.16s: So this takes longer.
50.60s: Think of anything that you try to sell.
53.28s: The more complicated it is, typically the more difficult it is to transact.
59.20s: Now, comparatively, if we exit one leg at a time, instead of trying to find somebody
67.20s: that wants all of these things, you're finding somebody that wants just this one thing.
72.56s: And then maybe finding somebody entirely different that wants just this one thing.
76.48s: And then so on and so forth.
78.60s: Now when we talk about the context of one, most of the time for the other side of this
81.88s: trade is going to be a market maker.
83.92s: But these individual trades go into a larger book of things.
90.20s: So this becomes a balance for them where they might want more of these and less of these.
97.48s: The last thing is every single one of these has a bit as spread.
103.52s: Now if you've ever played a bit as spread, you know, sometimes you might fill in an order
108.48s: and it can take a while for it to execute.
110.84s: Well, you're literally doing that effectively for all of these.
114.76s: So you might have the case where this individual leg is bid at a nickel and offered at 20 cents.
125.12s: It could be super liquid.
127.20s: So then as you're playing the mid price with your complex order in the center,
132.96s: this could be completely way off skewing whatever the mid price is compared to what the actual value
140.20s: of the spread might be.
142.48s: So this is exactly why it's more complicated and you have to look for a more niche counterparty.
150.52s: As always, if you have any questions, let me know.
152.32s: Ben, I'll answer you later.
