0.72s: hey everyone eric here with a very quick
2.80s: small
3.28s: stacks portfolio update i established a
6.40s: position
7.20s: in pfizer that i think is
10.40s: pretty well positioned i do think that
13.84s: it's going to be a little tough to
15.92s: manage in the small stacks portfolio
18.56s: i actually have it replicated in my
20.96s: margin account
22.08s: at a you know larger scale that i intend
25.04s: to manage
25.68s: a little differently and more actively
27.68s: but nonetheless i do like pfizer here
30.16s: and i like them as a long-term product
32.72s: so that's why
33.92s: i entered into a call diagonal
37.36s: so let's take a look at pfizer first and
41.12s: kind of where they're at and then we'll
42.96s: jump over to the portfolio
44.96s: so in general pfizer for the last two
48.00s: years has been coming down if we zoom
49.68s: out to the last five years it's still
51.28s: uptrending
52.40s: and we see them between the mid
55.68s: and -1 standard deviation channel which
59.04s: you know all sounds kind of par for the
60.56s: course and then i see them approaching
62.80s: the minus one standard deviation channel
64.48s: here
65.12s: now one of the reasons why i'm willing
67.36s: to get long here
69.04s: is i absolutely expect there to be a
72.24s: little bit more downside
73.76s: but if you take a look at it it's really
75.92s: not that
76.88s: large of a dollar value so we're gonna
78.96s: you know look at essentially 36 down to
80.88s: 33
82.00s: to get to the minus 2 standard deviation
84.56s: and
85.04s: moreover than that as soon as i can exit
88.64s: my xle position which is short puts i'll
91.68s: have up
92.40s: i'll have some free capital that i can
95.04s: apply to this trade
96.32s: to you know average my basis a bit and
100.00s: scale into the trade which is 100
102.96s: my my plan a few notes this is a
106.24s: in my opinion typically a very risky
108.32s: trade because
109.84s: we see the nine-day moving average
112.80s: essentially is going to close
114.08s: before the 50 very shortly and then
117.20s: we see price dropped below the 50
120.72s: and the 200 day that's typically not a
122.64s: good thing however
124.64s: i have a longer term perspective in this
127.28s: trait
127.92s: so that's why i'm willing to place it
130.96s: anyways despite some of the technical
133.36s: indications that
134.88s: you know indicate to me that there might
138.16s: be a little bit of chop coming up
139.92s: that's okay i am definitely in this
143.60s: for the the longer haul so let's take a
147.04s: quick look at the portfolio
148.88s: and what we have going on so
152.32s: first off we still have xlf and zynga
155.76s: both of those positions are expiring on
158.24s: the second
159.04s: and the ninth of october respectively so
162.08s: still not doing anything in either of
164.88s: these
165.92s: xlf pull that up quickly
169.60s: is essentially hanging out very very
172.24s: close
173.12s: to my basis but i still don't really see
176.32s: any sort of necessary adjustment to be
179.04s: done in there
180.08s: we will leave that one alone and then if
182.80s: we pull
183.36s: up zynga we see that that is
187.44s: just below my 8.50
190.96s: basis so i will leave that on at least
194.64s: for
195.04s: a while longer so that i can bleed out
198.32s: some more of the extrinsic value
200.24s: and then we'll go from there so neither
202.32s: one of these are in any sort of
204.32s: position that i feel like i need to
205.84s: manage aggressively
207.44s: then we have kroger and
210.88s: kroger right now still looks good i
213.84s: don't have
214.72s: any adjustments to make in there we're
216.64s: short the
218.00s: 36 call currently so if i pull this up
222.56s: we're short to 36 which is obviously
225.52s: looking
226.24s: completely fine right now with the
227.68s: product at 34.62
229.76s: now this may be a situation where in the
232.40s: next day or so
233.92s: i may close out that short call because
235.76s: if you remember it's pretty short time
237.36s: frame
238.24s: i have that expiring on the i'm sorry
241.60s: this one's on the 9th of october
243.68s: so this one is a little bit longer i was
245.52s: thinking about the prior trade
247.04s: but i might take this off before
249.44s: earnings for a small profit
251.52s: and then establish a new position closer
254.24s: to the current basis because it'll still
255.92s: be above my critical strike
258.00s: and capitalize on that earnings increase
260.96s: in volatility
262.16s: write out another shorter term trade and
264.48s: then establish a new longer term
266.00s: position
267.04s: so that's what i'm looking at in kroger
269.44s: and then in
270.64s: pfizer right now i established a
274.00s: one-to-one
275.12s: ratio and i just realized i i mixed up
279.20s: the uh the positions and kroger were
280.88s: short the 36 and a half not the 36
283.20s: 36 isn't pfizer sorry um
286.24s: and then in pfizer i'm long the 28
290.32s: call that is expiring 16 july 21
294.08s: and i paid 8.50 for it and then i am
296.88s: short
298.00s: the 9 october 36.
301.52s: the reason why i did that is in my
306.08s: small stacks account i went a little
308.72s: further out than i did in my margin
310.56s: account
311.20s: and i also made sure to
314.72s: essentially try to collect as much money
316.32s: as i can i like to
317.84s: trade these at a ratio which
321.20s: doesn't cap my upside but this is what
323.76s: trading a small account is
325.36s: all about so i think
328.48s: making sure that when i can scaling into
331.84s: the trade
332.40s: purchasing another leap so that my
334.08s: upsides not capped is
335.44s: certainly the goal once i free up some
336.96s: capital but for the time being
339.12s: this is just how it goes trading these
341.12s: smaller accounts so
342.72s: that's why i favored setting the
346.16s: short call a little further out in time
348.72s: so i can collect a little bit more money
351.04s: the overall trade is honestly really
353.60s: well structured it's over a
354.96s: 16 return on invested capital i put up
358.40s: 850 and i took in 138
360.96s: it's really just a well well set
364.00s: trade so we will see how this one plays
367.60s: out i
368.24s: definitely like pfizer longer term and
371.28s: its involvement with covid i think
372.80s: there's a lot of potential there
374.56s: and as kind of how i've been i'll
377.36s: continue
378.00s: updating the portfolio as i make
380.24s: different moves
381.04s: if anybody has any questions on anything
383.44s: i'm doing
384.40s: feel free to to drop me a line this is
386.72s: definitely
387.52s: you know a revisit for me i haven't
390.16s: traded a small account
391.36s: for for some time and it is an
394.24s: interesting intellectual challenge that
396.72s: oddly enough i welcome because these
400.24s: i view these accounts as puzzles you
402.48s: have to have the right pieces that fit
404.56s: together
405.44s: to make sure that you aren't putting
407.52s: this account in a bad spot
409.44s: one of the things i'm very careful about
411.44s: is the correlation
413.04s: and the correlation in a lot of these
414.80s: products is very low
416.08s: and that's by design it's offering me
418.08s: some sort of inherent diversification
420.64s: in case one certain group takes a hit
423.04s: not all of
423.68s: them necessarily take the same scale of
426.08s: hit
426.88s: and that is very purposefully by design
430.40s: so right now total utilization on the
432.80s: account is
434.28s: 98.84 we're almost completely utilized
437.84s: we have 49
441.96s: 4942 that is
444.80s: currently committed we do have a
446.48s: realized gain of 64 bucks so
448.48s: realistically my my capital
450.00s: is 5064. i just didn't bother inputting
453.52s: that yet
454.96s: but my utilization is most certainly
458.64s: pretty high so that is all good
462.56s: that's what i expect to see in the in a
465.12s: smaller account
466.24s: now as the market starts to capitulate
468.56s: maybe time to sit out for a while
470.24s: and just let the trades work because i
472.80s: do not want to start aggressively
474.80s: trading these
475.60s: and building up losses it's one of the
477.44s: the main goals i have to avoid in this
479.44s: account
480.08s: but i have no problem taking assignment
482.32s: on either xlf for zynga and just holding
484.48s: it
485.04s: for pretty much as long as i need to
486.80s: because i like both of those products
488.24s: long term to the upside
489.92s: and we'll kind of play it out see what
492.80s: the market shows us so
494.48s: as always anything you want me to talk
496.32s: about or any questions
497.52s: let me know and i will catch everybody
500.16s: later
