Tom Sosnoff
FOUNDER & CEO, TASTYLIVE

Tom Sosnoff is a trailblazer in the online brokerage industry, driving innovation and financial education for investors of all levels. He offers up his expertise in the options markets as co-host of tastylive LIVE!, airing daily on the tastylive network.

Leveraging over 20 years of experience as a Market Maker for the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and one of the original OEX traders in the S&P 100 Index pit, Tom pursued his vision to educate retail investors in options trading and build a superior trading platform and a brokerage firm that specialized in options.

Tom Sosnoff
FOUNDER & CEO, TASTYLIVE

Tom Sosnoff is a trailblazer in the online brokerage industry, driving innovation and financial education for investors of all levels. He offers up his expertise in the options markets as co-host of tastylive LIVE!, airing daily on the tastylive network.

A former floor trader, Tom became one of Chicago's most well-known serial entrepreneurs in fintech when he built a breakthrough options-trading platform, thinkorswim, later sold to TD-Ameritrade for $750 million.

Leveraging over 20 years of experience as a Market Maker for the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and one of the original OEX traders in the S&P 100 Index pit, Tom pursued his vision to educate retail investors in options trading and build a superior trading platform and a brokerage firm that specialized in options. With that vision in mind, tastylive was founded in 2011. Six years later, tastytrade launched with Scott Sheridan at the helm as CEO.

My name is Erik, I'm a Marine veteran, options trader, and investor. I started trading in 2007 and have spent over 30,000 hours honing my skillset. Like many, I came from a single mom who struggled - yet I became a multi-millionaire in my early 30s.

I’ve no secret tricks or ""easy money"" strategies. I carefully studied, planned, tracked results, and optimized my performance - and I openly share my journey. 

I built the Outlier Community to connect you with other driven people who are disinterested in average and focused on creating their optimal futures. It's a holistic community, centered on creating financial freedom and living a fulfilling life. From investing basics, options trading, stock market analysis, portfolio management to real estate investing, wealth development, psychology, discipline, fitness, etc. None of us find success solely on our own - here we create it together.

▬ ABOUT ERIK  ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬
My name is Erik, I'm a Marine veteran, options trader, and investor. I started trading in 2007 and have spent over 30,000 hours honing my skillset. Like many, I came from a single mom who struggled - yet I became a multi-millionaire in my early 30s.

I’ve no secret tricks or ""easy money"" strategies. I carefully studied, planned, tracked results, and optimized my performance - and I openly share my journey. 

I built the Outlier Community to connect you with other driven people who are disinterested in average and focused on creating their optimal futures. It's a holistic community, centered on creating financial freedom and living a fulfilling life. From investing basics, options trading, stock market analysis, portfolio management to real estate investing, wealth development, psychology, discipline, fitness, etc. None of us find success solely on our own - here we create it together.

#Trading #Stocks #BeAnOutlier

The stock market is a great tool in our approach to developing wealth. I started investing at 16 and have been actively trading for 15+ years. I don't come from money and am nothing special - yet I still made my first million before I was 30. 

I share my approach to trading and wealth development without the BS. I cover things like investing basics, options trading, portfolio management, trading psychology, real estate and angel investing, and my first hand experience in creating wealth. I regularly provide updates on the markets and my trades as well as host guests that share their respective perspectives and expertise. Welcome to the Outliers!

#Trading #Stocks #BeAnOutlier

The stock market is a great tool in our approach to developing wealth. I started investing at 16 and have been actively trading for 15+ years. I don't come from money and am nothing special - yet I still made my first million before I was 30. 

I share my approach to trading and wealth development without the BS. I cover things like investing basics, options trading, portfolio management, trading psychology, real estate and angel investing, and my first hand experience in creating wealth. I regularly provide updates on the markets and my trades as well as host guests that share their respective perspectives and expertise. Welcome to the Outliers!
