So I think there's a little more for us to poke through there. And then I want to continue rolling through the rest of the broader library. So that is the game plan for today. Now for those that don't know, I am starting a recurring video. It'll probably be either Thursday or Friday. I'm not exactly sure what I'm going to do it. But I'm starting to track a coverage strangle allocation of my portfolio in game stop. And the purpose behind this is to try and show a few different ways that we can leverage options to trade things like game stop because game stop is very, very lucrative for a lot of different reasons from an options trading perspective. Now I know that there's a lot of people that their overall preference is to hold game stop not trade it, which is totally cool. And that's the point of me using something like the covered strangle specifically. And it's because the base position is long equity. It's a holding of your choosing. Obviously in this case, we were talking about choosing game stop. And then we can trade options around that position. So I'm going to start doing a regular update on that. However, what I still don't have nailed down, which is exactly what I hope to",

And then we use the purpose of the question is I want to use an amount of money that is relatable to the average game stop holder. And a while ago, I asked the same question and there was a flurry of different responses of how much, you know, the person like the average person might hold in game stop. I saw everything from, you know, 5000, 50,000 or something like that. And to be honest, the way that I'm structuring this is I already have a series of game stop shares that I bought that are set off to the side as part of this thing I've told you about a bunch of times now. So I'm not going to belabor that point. So what I'm doing is I'm taking a subset of those shares and I'm going to use them for this portfolio. It's really not a portfolio. It's going to be in the primary portfolio. But for this allocation of the portfolio to run the strategy.

But it's, I don't know to say this without coming off wrong. It's just it's probably more my allocation is probably more than what most people would hold as my guess. So even though it's a smaller subset of the portfolio, I do it as a percentage. That's how I allocate stuff. So my guess is it can probably be whatever we want it to be.

And because I already have the shares, what I'm doing is I'm picking an average basis for those shares based on the period that I had scaled in. And we will use that as the basis. And I will just track it like I typically would in well, typically Excel. But now I've moved a lot of this stuff over to Google sheets. So if there is a Lauren says do a poll in your community tab. The problem with poll is that I have to input specific numbers. And I would rather just eyeball it. So I guess I could do that. That's a good wreck. Lauren, it's just I maybe I do like a ranger something. So let's do GME coverage strangle allocation size. So then we have like 5K. We have 10K. We have maybe 20K or 15K.

We walked on it with my wife and I the fun thing that's really difficult to gather by scale. Actually, I'll see if I can find one of the photos really quick from it. Just because it's I think it's really, really interesting. And I hope that you'll find it somewhat interesting as well. And it's things where it's like you can't fully get the context. And this good help. We're am I I'm already in the correct folder. We have a here we go.",

But like these crevices here are like 30 60 feet deep here. And then as you get up further, they're literally over 100 foot deep. Just these massive crevices, which is I think absolutely fascinating.

It's giant crustacean from the petadoic era comes out of the water. We were so scared Lord I'm not jumping the boner that time. It's what I know that that creature. It's true the bovets looking down with these big red eyes. It's so scary. And now you're out I said, what do you want from our monster and the monster bent down and said I need about tree fiddy. What's tree feed three dollars and 50 cents tree fiddy he wanted money. Tree feed. Now the fun fact is if you listen to this more and more.

So I'm going to zoom us back in and get back up to where we need to be. Here. And it says many brokers have transaction caps based on share value.

I was just curious if they had an actual conversation with TD. Here's the thing. During crazy market volatility, like if we're talking about trying to sell into a squeeze, you don't want to rest in order. And if you're trading something like game stop specifically, if you're resting any sort of limit order, there's a super solid chance you're not going to get filled. So I think that yeah, I think I don't know. I like I guess it's cool that they went through and they showed like the limits for the sell orders and stuff. But the other thing is that they're talking about sell orders with the stock price resting at what it currently is. And we've not actually seen game stop go parabolic like overnight. It still takes a couple days. So those sell orders would update meaning the limits on those sell orders would update to be sensitive to whatever the current price is. So yeah, my takeaway from that, although they went through each one is that if you're going to look to sell during a squeeze, you have to be positioned to like",

This doesn't really make a lot of sense to me, to be honest, because the broker is exceedingly unlikely during something like a squeeze to restrict the offload. The broker in general, and we've already seen this is going to be more likely to restrict the purchase, because that's what continues to drive share price up, which is the dangerous part. The dangerous part is not the unwind in terms of retail traders trying to take profit and sell. So I would be surprised. Do you guys have any historic reference for this?

The main thing to think about is that if you make a bunch of money, it's probably worth us reaching out to a good tax-preparer, CPA, tax attorney somebody.

Like this idea that this stock is going to run to 100,000 per share and that don't feel pressure to sell at that point. I mean, a couple things. The first thing is I go back to the idea of what we think the price target could be during something like Moas and from a functional standpoint, a functional standpoint. And the reason why I say that is because from a functional standpoint, if you recall the prior squeezes, the stock, it didn't get anywhere near 100,000, right? Like not even close. And the stock was stopped before it hit that. So my fear by somebody saying something like this, don't feel pressure to sell as soon as it gets to 100,000 is the likelihood of games stop hitting 100,000. I'm not saying is zero.

I'm not going to do anything. Like there's probably going to be a bunch of people that are going to miss out on a ton of money.

Because again, like the probability of game stop even getting pushed up to a thousand is really unlikely. It can happen and we saw it transact partials at way above a thousand by like 5K. So it's definitely possible. Like that's a possible range, but it's still an unlikely range for us to hit and then remain there for any significant duration of time. One of the things I see people reference a lot is the Volkswagen squeeze. The problem with making that comparison is markets are completely different now. They're completely different now. The regulations, the exchange rules, the way we process things, the amount of leverage that's out there. It's completely completely different now. So it's good to use Volkswagen as a reference point for a contextual understanding, but we have got to identify that it is not a direct parallel. It is not a direct parallel. We cannot say Volkswagen did this so game stop should at least be able to do that. We cannot make that statement because things are different now. This is in no way to belittle or to try to dismiss the idea of a squeeze. I know sometimes when people talk like I am right now, we will get labeled as like a shill. This is not to put down any of this. This is to try to have a pragmatic conversation about",

This is to try to have a pragmatic conversation about what is possible, what is likely, and what to do across that array. Because even if you're waiting for 10K before you start selling, it comes a big problem. Because what if it gets to 6K and you don't do anything? That sucks. We've lost on a ton of money. So the point I would like to reiterate is just look at your portfolio, look at your number of shares and then pick the price levels that you're comfortable with. And if it doubles in price, maybe you sell 10, 15, whatever you want, 25, pick the numbers. You can literally build an excel sheet that helps you track the numbers that you're comfortable with. And I'll show you. So if we grab a scratch part of this, and let's say that we have 10,000, let's just say we have 10,000, what do we think maybe like a thousand shares? Let's say we have a thousand shares at 20. So we're 20K in. Now, what we can do is eyeball different levels of the stock in what you're comfortable selling as a percentage of your holdings.

So then you have to decipher how much you're comfortable unwinding at different levels and at what percentages. So let's say game stop first goes to 40. I would call that insanely probable, like exceedingly probable. This would be like base case scenario very likely to happen. And then let's say that we have game stop at 80 still very probable. This is less probable than 40 for sure. Obviously, but it's entirely probable. Then we'll do like 120, maybe 150. I'm just picking different price levels that we might think game stop could get to. Right. Just eyeballing here. And then maybe 300, maybe 500, something like this to start. And then you can build this out as far as you want to go. So what you can say is what would my portfolio be worth at all of these levels and how much would I potentially want to trim. And if I trim X amount, how much does that leave me left with?

And then we will leave a smaller amount on for as things hopefully continue to run in our favor. So then we can say maybe at 40, at 40, we would take off 10 because that's a modest move, nothing crazy. At 80, we might take off another 20 that leaves us 70 remaining. And what is how many steps is this along the way? And we have five steps left to go. So then maybe if it hits to 120, we ramp this up again and we take off up higher amounts. So the way I would look at this is you have 100 total here. This would be your total remaining. So this will be a sum of this, of this, this becomes your residual. And you can tinker with these numbers to figure out again based on the likelihood of hitting these different numbers, how much you might want to unwind. Now what I can tell you is for me personally, I would absolutely lean into way more heavily this beginning stage of the move. 40 is still a little light in my opinion.

We can literally hit 40 on just standard price movement. Like that's not squeeze at all at this point. 40 is just normal stock going up because the company is doing pretty well. So 40, I personally would not be heavily incentivized to unwind very heavily. Again, personally, I'm giving you my opinion and my perspective so that then you can paint and create your own. Now if this were me personally, I would add in probably another step here though. And I would have stock at 60 because starting with stock at 60, I would start unwinding more heavily. So stock at 60, I probably would take another 20 down, something like that. So this would leave about half the trade on at this point. Once we get up to something like 80, I would probably take off a pretty meaningful amount of the position at this point, maybe 30 or 40 total. So this would leave me 30 left to go across these residual phases. So then I essentially would just split 10 out across these, something like this.

Let's say you got in at 11, 11, 50, we'll call it and literally let's look at another example. So we have the stock at 11, 50 and we're saying that we have a 20 or 15,000 account, whatever, release 15,000 account. So this means you have mail, not just kidding. 1300 shares, 1304. Technically, we have to round this down. You can't have, I don't, partial shares are fake. So I don't, I don't fuck with partial shares. So you have 13 or four shares. So now, let's say that the stock doubled in price. And did it double before it didn't. So let's say on this first jump up, you want to start looking at selling towards the mid at 28 and a half, 28.5. So now the stock is at 28.5. And you decide that you want to unwind some of your shares. This is not phone numbers. This is not even that significant of a move. This isn't even a big run up yet. But I want to show you something. First, I have to show my way into formatting this. Otherwise, my OCD won't let me show you shit. So here you have this minus this times this. So this is your profit at this point on top of this. Right. So this is what I'm showing you here is the difference between 1150 and",

So this is what I'm showing you here is the difference between 1150 and 28.5 on your 1304 shares. So solid, like super solid amount of money that you've made. Let's say when this doubled, you're like, I'm going to take 50 of this profit down, take 50 down. So you would sell half of this overall cost. So let's do that. And then let's look at how many shares we have now. We need to add a calm for total cost. Oops, wrong one. I'm done. We need 30 here. So that's our total cost at the time. Total value at this point would be this times this. Profit would equal this minus this. So this is how much you're actually up in making. So then we can say, all right, I have 37,000. I have 22,000 profit. I want to take half of this profit down. Easy choice. So there's a few different ways you can either just decide in amount of shares. I would personally just use the dollar amount at a cost level. And I would say I just want to take half this down. So equals this divided by two. So we're going to take 50 of it down. So then I'm going to figure out how many shares",

Now with the stock at 1855, the cost of your residual position of 915 shares, you have 16,000 that are in the position by itself. But remember, we literally took half of it out over here. So this is our booked realized profit right here, 11K. So now, when this comes back down to 1855, guess what we can do? We can now buy more shares. So let's take this divide by the current price of 1855, which is 597. So now let's take a look at our new position. This plus this, you can now have 1512 shares. So this might, as I'm looking at these numbers and the way I'm talking about it, this might sound crazy, right? Like the way I'm rattling off. But the ultimate thing I want you to take away from is that if you bought here, we called it 1150 or whatever, if you bought here at 1150. And you just held from 1150 up here, down here.

I didn't even play playing the rest of the squeeze. I literally just said price doubled a little bit, doubled and then some, not much though. And offload half of it, I didn't play the rest of the squeeze in this example. But now take a look at what we've been able to do. Instead of having 13 and 104 shares, we now have 1512.

And what I'm doing is I'm using the movement of the stock to opportunistically monetize the movement. So that then when it has residual moves, I can have a 16 larger position after adding zero dollars. I've added no money in this scenario. I've not put anything into this. But I can now have a 16 larger position than I did previously by adding no money. This is why management is so important. So a little bit of a rabbit hole and dovetail off of this one single line as you could tell the way that my brain works. But I want that point to be really, really clear because for people that read this and they're like, well, I'm just going to wait until this level. That's okay, right?

But what I can tell you is that in the process of waiting for this scenario, the trader will have given up so much profit along the way that going into this move waiting for 100k, maybe they have 100 shares, but they could have had 116 shares based on the example that I just gave you on a suboptimal example of a move. And you have a much bigger position to go into this. So yeah, those are my thoughts. I love their idea about planning an exit in finding things that you're comfortable with what levels you want to be at and stuff like that. I think that's good. I think that's really good. But I think that a little more nuance is required in the approach because you can end up at a far, far, far better off position than what this person would be at. All right, let me get caught up on the chat. And it looks like I see 39, and six, and 46 okay. So that's super helpful. Wigglyworm says this spreadsheet is on the Patreon, right?

If there's any question that you asked and I missed just let me just let me know just throw back in there and I'm happy to take a look. But I just wanted this to be super clear because through opportunistic selling, you can drastically enhance your position without adding any money so that when and if you do eventually get the move that you're wanting to see, you will make way more money than somebody like this that might not be willing to sell until it hits 100K. All right. I love this. Don't sell everything at once. This is good. Sell on the way down is dangerous. I don't dislike it, but it's dangerous. The scaling process, I think, especially in something like GameStop has to be done very cautiously because if you sell on the way down, let's just use it as an example.

Let's say that you sold on the way up when it was surging here on the sixth and let's say that once it broke above 45, you decided to start selling even though it was on the way up. If you waited to sell on the way down, the stock opened here at 37. So that's the way down. So then if you start unwinding on the way down as expected or as we discuss, that's almost a 10 point loss you take here. I'm not saying that's a bad idea. I'm just saying you should be aware of the risk in doing so. And this is actually why I think setting different price levels for scaling makes a lot more sense than just trying to catch it on the drop. This is another great example of this. If you sell on the way down here, you get out at 49. If you wait to get out a day here, it opens up at 40, right? That's a nine point drop that you consume there. So again, I'm not saying in I rarely would talk about exiting all at once, right? It doesn't make sense.

So it doesn't like selling on the way down in this case doesn't it doesn't really save you. The other thing to keep in mind is based on the logic here, if we sell on the way down and we scale and we scale slowly, the overwhelming potential is you're going to miss most of the move. Because again, remember, let's use this as an example. This is one day. This is two days. This is three days by day four. It's back down to standard levels by day four. So depending on how slow and how little we scale out on the way down, this can set you up for unwinding 30 of the position by the time it gets back down to levels here. So I think what makes more sense is like we were just talking about picking different price levels. That makes sense for your holdings of the portfolio. And as you start to approximate to those levels, because by doing this, you are inherently leaving runners out. You already have position remaining to take advantage if the move continues.",

Again, the problem with this, and I understand, and I appreciate the vision that they have and what they're trying to do. The probability of you selling a game stop share for a seven figure price is, I mean, again, it's just objectively insanely low because it was already stopped from doing so before. So there's nothing wrong with thinking about that, trying to consider, visualize, hoping that it happens. That's all fine.

And if I tell them no regarding a resource that I have and I built on my own and that bothers them, I do not literally care at fucking all, at all. And if it pisses them off and they don't want to talk to me or anything like that, that literally tells you that that's somebody that you shouldn't have around you anyways. And I tell you guys this specifically because a lot of my friends are military friends and a lot of them know they've been to my house. They've been around me like they know that I've done well. And even in that case, like when I, when I take them out to dinner or stuff, I always will pay for dinner because I want to and I can and I'm in a different spot. I'm fortunate for that. But most of them will still then mow me after dinner. I don't ask. I literally don't want them to. But they will then mow me typically more than what they're fucking dinner costs.

Yeah, this isn't like special banking, by the way. Like they're making it sound like you have like a specific bank or something. It's just economies of scale. So it's like a CD account. Have you ever looked at CD rates and their CD rates for like a 5,000 account or 25 or 50, 100 and plus? There's there's economies of scale. So when you park a lot of money in a bank, that absolutely benefits the bank. So they're incentivized to make it nicer for you. So yeah, like there will be perks involved for sure, but you don't have to like go to a specific bank or something like that. Lawyer up, that's fine. Financial advisor. Sure, if you think you need it, can't emphasize enough to work with an advisor that is a fiduciary. This is good advice. I honestly don't think most people need a financial advisor.

To say it literally is the same shirt I don't care at all. That's not to say that for people that like designer clothes that that's a poor marginal utility. The marginal utility is up to the person. It's up to the individuals up to what you value as a human being. And that's what this exercise was built for to help me identify those things. Because one of the things I noticed was when I was poor, I would look at anything related to money. And I would always think like, oh, that's superficial or oh, that's lame or oh, this or oh, that. And it's me managing expectations. Right? I'm mature enough at this point that I can definitely tell you that younger Eric would look at designer clothes and think that's so stupid.

I'm mature enough at this point that I can definitely tell you that younger Eric would look at designer clothes and think that's so stupid. Like such a colossal waste of money, unbelievable, just like pure superficial nonsense bullshit. And the people that would buy that kind of stuff for that. And that's just me coping with something that I didn't have access to and didn't understand. As I started to realize this understanding marginal utility, the process of building wealth and identifying the things that value to you. Again, I can tell you from the bottom of my heart, I do not understand designer clothing. I do not understand. I don't get it. But just because I don't get it doesn't mean that somebody else doesn't derive true marginal utility from the important thing is to find what you as an individual derive marginal utility from. That's what you value. That's the stuff that's worth spending your money on. So to this person's exact point, a lot of times when people don't have money, find their way into money, they think that if they go out and they buy a bunch of expensive stuff that they see influencers use, or they've seen in movies or movie stars or whatever Instagram. And they think that they're supposed to go buy a bunch of this really expensive stuff. And then they do it and then they realize like, oh, fuck,",

And it inherently won't do that. So try to think about what you derive true marginal utility from. And I really agree with their point here is even if like even if you think a lambo is really cool, if you're not really a car person, it's a terrible investment. I love cars. I grew up building cars. So for me, cars is a completely different thing, right? Like I don't buy cars and work on cars because I think somebody else is going to think something about me. I couldn't possibly care less. But I really enjoy them. I have a lift that I put in my house so that I could work on them. I love working on cars. So it's a significant marginal utility. What I can tell you is that if that's not you and you don't really care about them that much and you are acquiring something because you think somebody else might look at you or perceive you a certain way, that's true superficial. Does it means nothing? That means we're literally purchasing something in the hopes that somebody else might recognize us in some type",

So just think about what you personally derive marginal utility from. That's absolutely the case. And then the other thing I think I saw somebody, where was it? Dan says the people with most money are actually the most frugal. It's really not true at all to be honest. That's another thing I find that I because I used to think the same thing as well. You'll hear the thing of like, oh, you know, super rich people, they drive a Honda Accord. And it's like Warren Buffett drives around in his Cadillac, but he bought a fucking jet, right? The point I'm making is that he has no problem spending on the things that he derives marginal utility from. So just remember being frugal is essential. You have to be frugal. There's nothing wrong and it's really smart to be frugal. But people with money are willing to spend the money on things that they derive marginal utility from.

He couldn't possibly care less about that. But he's happy to hop on his jet. So the note there is the concept of rich people being like the most frugal. It's really not that true because you don't get rich by not being frugal. You have to be frugal unless you're just really fortunate and you're born into it. However, what I've learned is that most people with money are more than happy to spend it on the things that they value. Another thing that I've seen some of my more wealthy friends spend money on is like these really extravagant dinners and they're like buying booze out and stuff like my wife and I really don't drink. But the idea of paying like 60 for a cocktail is fucking crazy to me. Even it's not like I'm against drinking, I would. It's typically don't feel inclined to. But I'm too cheap for that.

I could just tell the way that they were talking interacting. Like I didn't like the culture. I didn't like the vibe. And that's my predisposition. That doesn't mean that they all suck. It means that I just didn't like it. So I don't think it's wise to cast large statements like that about broad groups because like you don't know them. So I think preconceived judgments like that tend to indicate more ignorance than anything. Because again, you'll find rich people that suck. You'll find poor people that suck. You'll find rich people that are awesome and would give you the shirt off the back if they knew you. And you'll find poor people that will do the same. So I would just avoid disliking somebody based on some trait like that preemptively. Oh right. Terminal and economy. I could totally see this. If things start getting like super crazy, I agree with this. Had you against hyperinflation. So this were already kind of past. Cool. What time I got? I got time for a little more.

I don't really identify with where we're choosing the exits. But that's up to literally up to the individual. As some says, everything is superficial. The only not superficial thing we do is die. I mean, you could think that. I definitely don't agree with that.

And I mean, there's the people that try to make it, but a lot of them don't make it. GC says Graveteris asked about selling options during a major squeeze like Moas or a major squeeze. What about it? Okay, but in a Moas, well, contracts event event actually be able to be sold for their true intrinsic value, you really have to exercise and quickly sell to get the most value. Well, you're going to run out of liquidity super fast. So there is a significant chance that during a big squeeze, depending on what you have, whether it's long call short calls, puts whatever, like the volatility is going to go through the roof. So if you're trying to play the squeeze via options, which I wouldn't do personally, trying to get an exit via options during the squeeze is going to be really difficult. The other problem is, is that if you go the route of exercise, depending on how the broker handles it, you might not be able to exercise mid day. You might only be able to exercise the end of day.

So you have to be careful about that as well so that you don't get stuck holding something that otherwise you would want to exit from. But the other thing to keep in mind is that even though liquidity would go out the window, you still would make a ton of money. So even if you don't get an optimal fill, it would be, it would still likely be way more than what you would make on the share equivalent due to the leverage alone. It just wouldn't be the full amount that you theoretically should make because of liquidity. So that's why when GameStop is going through the cycles and stuff, I do use options. But it's for the smaller cycle moves and yeah, it's a little bit different. This is a good, this is a good beard. I think we've read these before. Okay, here we go. Yep. Don't more shares than they have to be market demand. Direct buyers don't know that they're buying short. These are the violations of brokers. Yeah. Okay.

Yeah, these are all we've read these ones before. Get to the bottom of this. And and now is a great time, by the way, if there's anything else that you want to hit before we wrap up, now's the perfect time to start dropping them in. Big daddy Dave Lauer, I'm actually doing another podcast or I think we're doing a live stream on the Irvin channel next week. I for those that don't know, I am affiliated with Irvin. I was one of the first round investors in the company and then I added more capital through a couple of the additional rounds and I create content with them and stuff. I just really like Dave and I like what they work on. So I just like that stuff to be known if I do have an affiliation with something or somebody I do with him. All right, let me drop a comment here so that I have where we are. This this will be leave off for 4 Jan 25. Look at us go for Jan 25. All right, let me close this down or not. That's another choice.

Dylan says, what do you think about shorting some of these quantum stocks through back ratios? I was looking at some in RGTI 30 days out. I'd like to try to short without having as much upside exposure. Yeah, I mean, you could do something like that. You're going to have a little bit more of a vol perspective.
