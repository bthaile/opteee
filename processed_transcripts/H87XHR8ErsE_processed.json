    "text": "Probability of Profit is really misleading for most people. Take a look at a comment I found on Reddit. This person seems to think that if they sell high probability profit on high implied volatility spreads that they are mathematically guaranteed to make money. This is complete bullshit. It's not how it works. We need to understand the concept of expectancy. When we deploy a strategy over a long period of time building a larger sample size, how that strategy performs. Because I'll tell you what. You can have a very high probability of profit and still lose money on a strategy. You've got to understand the whole picture. This is a small part of a bigger, more important formula.",
