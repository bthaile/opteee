Well, I mean I I don't like to get too cute and I think when you're talking about especially, you know, if you're going to make a pairs trade um, you kind of have to use futures. There's not really pairs transverse stocks are too expensive to cap on intensive and pairs transverse options are too lopsided Especially if you're a short sell, you know, especially if you like the short side So if you're a premium seller like me you can't really use options for pairs trades That forces you into futures futures have less optionality than other instruments They're pretty black and white. So I kind of like the um, you know, the leverage and the simplicity of futures for pairs trades only You know, and so so so it doesn't give you a lot of flexibility I mean you really have you know, there's three futures in the index world that you that are liquid enough to trade There's the Russell. There's the Nasdaq on the SPs So those are your three food groups. There is not really a lot of other stuff you can do Got it makes sense When you look back at 2023, I know you've done a couple series on this on tc.lye which have been really cool",

It was it was statistically insignificant from a trader's perspective Yeah, that makes sense When you take a look at how 2023 behaved 2024 First two months in line with expectations any surprises thus far Um, I think From my perspective. Yeah, there's been some surprises. I'm surprised by the strength of these Um, I'm probably not surprised by the strength of the SPs as much as I'm surprised by the strength of these you know chipstock specifically You know Nvidia The SMC SMC I before it crept out, but you know clearly in video up into the 700s Um, and I think you know Microsoft being able to hold over 400 the SPs being able to pretty much you know Hull-tited 5000 I kind of feel like that's been a surprise for first quarter Yeah, and then looking over earnings anything stick out to you there. We're obviously closing down this next quarter at least for me I've been surprised to see the number of beats but not significant follow through actually literally what we're just talking about in terms of Pied so anything stick out to you for earnings?

It's it's really gonna be a challenge for us on a regulatory side You know the the the hurdles we have and the blockers are like you know the SEC Gary Gensler all that kind of stuff Those are those are hurdles, but without those you know as long as we continue to push the technology to the forefront um, I don't see why everything Why anything is off the table in the next 10 years that includes politics events um sports betting tokenization all from a single platform And all with high-frequency one-tick wide markets That's the interesting part that that very last part.
