    "text": "There are a lot more than the five Greeks. Most options traders are used to seeing. So the goal of this video is to give you a deeper understanding of the primary Greeks and then give you a cursory overview of the second and third order Greeks that you might be less aware of. This will be generally less applicable to most people, good reference material, and if you're a sophisticated trader, some of this stuff will actually be quite useful to you. So we're going to go through what these different orders mean, then we're going to get into some misconceptions up front, and then we're going to dive into the Greeks themselves. What's up everybody? Eric here, welcome back to the outliers. Shout out to the Patreon family. If what I do helps you out, consider signing up. Let's get straight to it. So what do these different orders mean? Well, when you talk about options, we're generally going to be talking about different factors in the context of a differential equation. We're not going to go deep into that world in this video today, but just know that that is essentially what we're doing. So the first order Greeks, they give you various factors sensitivity with respect to price. That's what WRT means with respect to. You're going to see that a lot. So just earmark what this means. Second and third order Greeks simply take the next step of that derivative. So second order Greeks are",

Second and third order Greeks simply take the next step of that derivative. So second order Greeks are the derivative of first order with respect to an additional factor. And then third does that to second. If that makes no sense to you, don't worry. We're going to get through it together and it gets easier when we get to the breakdown. Before that, let's talk about some misconceptions. First off, Greeks make you money. No, they don't. Second Greeks provide edge. No, they don't. What do Greeks do? They measure things. That's it. You have to figure out how you can structure things to make money. The Greeks can give you some ideas about that, but there is no inherent edge in knowing the Greeks or any way that the Greeks outright make you money. They simply measure things. Now that we got that aside, let's get into these Greeks. Notice we are starting with the first order Greeks. And that is because these are the most common. If you'll notice, there's four of them here, but at the beginning of the video, I said the five primary Greeks. So are we missing one? No, one of the five primary Greeks is actually a second order Greek, which we'll get to that in a minute. So we",

No, one of the five primary Greeks is actually a second order Greek, which we'll get to that in a minute. So we have delta, beta, Vega, and row. Delta and row have another Greek in parentheses next to it. So delta has lambda, row has epsilon. Why is that? You'll find out in just a minute, but just know that that is another Greek. So we'll start with delta. This is pretty commonly understood. That is the premium rate of change per one point move in the underlying price movement. It's also a proxy for probability of an option expiring in the money, which is actually kind of useful, but also grossly inaccurate in other instances. I'll throw a video in the notes below that walks through delta as an approximation of being in the money so that you can be more well versed on that. And then it also represents the notional value that you're trading. So let's take a look at a quick example. I'm going to use Apple. And right now we're looking at the 19 Jan expiration chain. This is delta. Now when you look at an options chain, this is always in the context of if you were to buy the option. So when we're looking at this column that shows the range of these different figures,",

So when we're looking at this column that shows the range of these different figures, it's in that same context as if you were to buy that option. If you choose to sell the option, the inverse sign applies. So let's take a look at this 190 put in Apple. The delta of that is negative 0.30. So going back to options 101, every contract that you trade a standard contract, a one lot represents up to 100 shares of the underlying. However, when you trade options, it doesn't behave like that full 100 shares right out of the gate. So in this case, this is telling you that this contract is 190 put right now is behaving as if it was short 30 shares. That's also where the rate of change of the premium will come per dollar move in the underlying. So if you sold this option, what happens to this sign? It becomes a positive. So if you sell this 190, put that means your position is behaving like long 30 shares of Apple. Now the further you go out of the money, delta is going to approximate to zero. The deeper in the money you go, delta is going to approximate to one or negative one. You'll notice on the call",

The deeper in the money you go, delta is going to approximate to one or negative one. You'll notice on the call side, delta is positive on the put side, delta is negative. Again, if you're on the call side and you choose to sell this 47 delta you would then be holding a position that's behaving as if you were short 47 shares of Apple at this price. So the punchline here is that when you're looking at an option chain, all of the Greeks are provided in a sense that you are buying. So if you choose to sell all of them flip delta, gamma theta, Vega, row, all flip. Okay, a couple of the things about delta. It is typically about a 50 delta if you are at the money and delta doesn't really care if you are at one DTE or if you are at 50 DTE, it's still going to behave generally the same where about 50 delta is going to be at the money further you go out, delta is going to approximate to zero and then the one the further in the money you go. Now let's talk about theta. Theta is the rate of change in premium from the passage of time and we measure that by one DTE. So each time one day",

Theta is the rate of change in premium from the passage of time and we measure that by one DTE. So each time one day passes theta is decaying out of the option. So again, using the same example of these 190s will go back to the 22 DTE and the 190, that 30 delta option, it has a theta of negative 0.06. So this means every day that passes everything else remaining the same, you are losing six cents out of that options premium. Notice how I said everything else being the same. This is a really important note. The Greeks are only as good as when you look at them. What that means is markets move. All of the inputs that go into the Greeks are constantly changing. So it's not a static figure more often than not. Some of them are more resilient to intraday movement. Others are not. So a couple notes about theta. You'll notice that it's highest at the money and the further out of the money you go or the further in the money you go, the further down it goes. Why is that? Because an option has the highest extrinsic value at the money, the most time value. The further something is out of the money, the less time value it has has no intrinsic value. So",

The further something is out of the money, the less time value it has has no intrinsic value. So theta can't be high because there's not much left to decay out. Same thing if you go super deep in the money, there's not a lot of extrinsic value. So there's not a lot of theta to decay out. A couple other notes about theta. The rate of theta decay looks a lot like this graph. This is taken from an actual options chain. Notice how really long DTE, 100 days to expiration, theta does not decay that much day over day, even 20, 30 day blocks. Notice when you go from 90 to 60, it starts to accelerate. And then as you go 60 and in, it parabolically approximates to zero because every single option expires at that point, it can have no more extrinsic value. So theta accelerates the closer to expiration that you are. This is precisely why when I'm trading things like the ratio call diagonal ratio, put diagonal, I use longer dated options for my longs so that I'm not wasting away with theta. And when I'm selling, I tend to sell shorter term time frames to capitalize on that curve. Now let's move on to Vega. Vega is the premium change of an option",

And a super annoying nerd fact, Vega isn't a Greek. It actually would be considered Kappa, but that doesn't apply as cleanly as Vega volatility. So they went with Vega theta, time delta direction, row rates that didn't work for Kappa and volatility. So anyways, useless fact for you. And I appreciate that. Vega is the highest at the money and it's constant. It behaves a little bit different than the other Greeks. So if we grab Vega right here, notice how Vega is highest at the money. The further you go out of the money, it drops. Same thing the further in the money you go, it drops. This is kind of an important figure because depending on the time frame that you're trading, shorter term time frames are going to see Vega moving more. And you'll notice that a lot of these kind of behave that way where if we go further out in time, you'll have more Vega in the options. Notice how it peaks up to this. Why is that? Well, because there's more extrinsic value, but as a percentage of the remaining premium, it gets to be a little bit",

Well, because there's more extrinsic value, but as a percentage of the remaining premium, it gets to be a little bit jacked up when there's at the money, not that much time left. It's also product dependent, but it's just an important note. Notice how with something that's trading for 2.37, 0.38, the Vega here is 18. So in this case, the 70 DTE, this represents like 6.8 of the premium, the Vega. And out here, it's closer to like 7.6. So again, just kind of a general data point that's useful to be aware of. And then if we look at row, this is the premium change from a 1 move in the risk free rate, which is used to price options. This is less impactful to most traders. This generally is going to impact longer term options far more. So this is less used by most traders. Now, notice how Lambda and Epsilon are here. Lambda is essentially the percent equivalent of delta. So Lambda takes the premium percent change per 1 change in the spot price, and Epsilon does that for row. So those are technically two more Greeks. So far, first order Greeks are down. Did we miss one? Because I said that there's five primary Greeks, but as we already talked about, no. The next that",

Gamma is the delta rate of change to a one point move in the stock price. So when we think about gamma, there are a couple things that will strike you. The first one is gamma is much higher, the closer we get to expiration. So if we take a look at an at the money option, 78 DTE, notice the gamma is 0.02. If we take that into eight DTE, the gamma is 0.08. Why is this the case? Well, if gamma is the rate of change of delta, and we know that as we get closer to expiration, every option has to make a choice. It's either going to have a delta of 0 and be out of the money, or it's going to have a delta of 1 plus and be in the money. So in this case, you notice that all of the in the money options have delta of about one, and everything that's out of the money has a delta approximating to 0. So gamma is higher, the closer you get to expiration, because every single option has to make that choice. So this is typically what",

So gamma is higher, the closer you get to expiration, because every single option has to make that choice. So this is typically what helps buyers and hurts sellers. Okay, so now we're going to move on to charm, which is also known as delta decay. So this is the delta rate of change per one point move in days to expiration. So as each one day moves, and it is the derivative of premium to delta and theta, it is also the derivative of theta with respect to spot price. So what do we use charm for? It gives us an idea of how delta is going to behave with respect to time. That's it. Next we have Vanna, which is known as D Vega D spot, and that is the ratio of Vega changing from a one point move in the spot price. It's also known as D delta D vol, which is the rate of change of delta per one percent change in volatility. So what we're getting an idea of here is how volatility is interacting with both Vega spot price relationship and then also delta and volatility relationship. Vera, which a lot of people have probably never heard of, that's the row change to a one percent change in volatility and a one percent change in interest rates. So",

This one's actually kind of interesting. So it is the Vega rate of change to a one percent move in volatility and a one percent move in DTE. So as you get closer to expiration, Veda increases. And the way to think about most of this as as an option gets closer to expiration, things move more because there's a lot that has to happen. Like we talked about with respect to delta of everything needing to make a choice between being a delta of one or a delta of zero, you're either going to be in the money or out of the money. So there's a lot of other changes that are occurring as we get closer. Then we have Vala, which is also known as Volga, and that kind of reminds me of Helga from Hey Arnold. But this is Vega convexity also known as D Vega D vol. So this is your Vega rate of change from a one percent",

We have color, speed, ultima, and zama. And if you don't know, there's actually more than this. That starts tying the Greeks and the behavior between two different products together. But I'm sticking with these because again, most of these at this point probably don't apply to most of us, but they're good to know. So let's get to color, which is gamma decay. So it tells us the gamma rate of change per one point move in DTE. Then we have speed, which is the gamma of gamma. And you'll notice a lot of these, especially in the third order, all of them, are tied to volatility. That is because volatility is quite literally the lifeblood of options. So people that manage different kinds of portfolios, especially at a professional level, you actually care quite a bit about some of these, especially if you trade derivatives, because volatility can completely unpack a beautifully built position pretty quickly. So that is exactly why we have all of these different measures of volatility's impact to these other things.",

Then we have ultima, which is dvaama dvaal, which is the Vama. Vama, I want to make sure I'm pronouncing that well for you guys, Vama rate of change per one percent move in Vega or Vega convexity. When you think about convexity in these definitions, it's giving you a sense of the shape of the measurement. So if something's convex, it typically has this kind of shape to it. Then we have zama, which is d gamma, dvaal, gamma rate of change per one percent move in volatility. So why do we care about all of these? Because they are giving you insight to how fast something like gamma is going to start to move, which actually matters quite a bit to sellers. So if you sell options, do we really care about color speed? Ultima and zama? Well, potentially. But depending on the strategy, it's more likely than not gamma will suffice in a pretty big way. However, if you're interested in tinkering with the rest of these, here they are for you. And for the Patreon folks, if you go to the",

However, if you're interested in tinkering with the rest of these, here they are for you. And for the Patreon folks, if you go to the shop, you can download this exact reference sheet. And it's for free for everybody that's silver and above. And if you're not on there, you can literally just screenshot this and then build your own if you would like a reference. So if you have any questions on these, let me know. The punchline is for most traders, Delta, theta, Vega, Ro and gamma. And even Ro is a kind of sus because for a lot of people that trade shorter term options less so, but I still would give it credit here. These five are going to be the most important. And then from here, you can take a look at depending on the strategy, how important changes in volatility will impact your position. But these five are probably your most important ones. Once you understand these, if you want to dive deeper and deeper into the world of creating graphs that show how these move, it's actually pretty fun. I guess in a really nerdy way, can't believe I just said that. So if you have any questions, let me know. Be an outlier. See you later.",
