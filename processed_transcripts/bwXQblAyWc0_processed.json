    "text": "What's up everyone? Taking a quick look at the GameStop options chain to kick us off for this week. I just want to see if anything looks interesting over the weekend. If we've seen any changes in volatility, we'll make a quick update on what we have in terms of open interest, volatility, volume, those kinds of things so that we know what we're heading into. And a quick shout out to my buddy Richard, he and I spoke yesterday for a good part of the afternoon. It was like four hour conversation. It was so, so useful to me because as I've mentioned to you guys numerous times, I am a guest in this house. I don't have all of the background the history that you all do, but I am enthralled by the story. It's a giant puzzle that I'm enjoying interacting with because I've been trading options for a long time. I'm pretty good at that. And it becomes generally programmatic after a while. So having something pop up like this that truly is anomalous is been very fun for me to dig deeper into. I've traded GameStop before during other episodes, but I didn't quite get as deep into the lore. And Richard essentially gave me a master class. He took the time during his afternoon to share that with me. So I'm beyond thankful. I'm sure most of you already know his channel, but if not, you absolutely should go check it out, subscribe. He",

I'm sure most of you already know his channel, but if not, you absolutely should go check it out, subscribe. He has a incredible resource on GameStop. He's built this giant Google sheet that he shares with everybody for free. Tons of awesome information. All right, where did we leave off on the 28th of June Friday? Well, pretty simple. We saw a couple interesting transactions come through. However, most of the larger transactions that took place on Friday in terms of the options markets, were kind of sporadic. We had a couple going out into five July. This is also five July. These should all be shaded the same color. And most of the transactions that we saw were buys, but nothing too large. We had some activity out in 12 July and then 19 July. 19 July is starting to get a bit more active with the second largest size on here, except for this one really interesting trade where it looked like somebody was establishing a position at the 11 calls, essentially to get assigned. That's what it looked like to me. So let's hop over to the platform to look at what we're seeing now. So right now we have about 131 IV.

The first thing that is very anomalous to me is how steady this is across different cycles. So if we go back here, volatility kind of popped up a little bit, but it's still drastically suppressed from what we saw some time ago. The reason why I care so much about this, I had a couple people ask me why I talk about this part so much, is because option markets are very smart. They're actually pretty predictive. So what that means is there are studies that look at changes in both the at the money, call and put implied volatilities across different iterations and how predictive that is a future price movements. Without going all the way down the rabbit hole of the study, although I will happily link to a couple of them in the notes below for you to check out. As I always say, you should believe none of what you hear half of what you see. You should be able to validate most of what people say if you're to believe them. And so this is another one of those instances. You should absolutely check that study out. But when I look at the volatility here in GameStop, it's actually very telling to me, when I start to see",

But when I look at the volatility here in GameStop, it's actually very telling to me, when I start to see really big call volatility, there's a natural tendency as we get closer to expiration for the really far out of the money's to drift up that typically won't outpace the put side. The put side typically will trade at a higher IV because the market tends to fear the downside more. Where to weird spot now? Because with this recent share offering, essentially the removal of debt from GameStop, they kind of have a capped in downside, even at a cash value. So it's still quite a bit lower technically than where it is now. If I'm not mistaken, it's like 13 or so per share, but that's still essentially a floor that eventually gets baked into the product. So that part is slightly interesting. There's still, again, a pretty decent amount. It would have to go to get there. So when I look at the volatility across these different expiration cycles, there's a couple of things that stick out to me. I'm gonna focus on the primary expiration cycles the 19 July and the 16 August. I know that this doesn't discreetly line up with some of the cycle theories that are going around.

Richard and I were actually talking quite a bit about his most recent one, which is fascinating and very well informed, I believe. And right now, I'm just not seeing the option markets necessarily mirroring too much of it, but it could also be that it's a little too early. A lot of what Richard is looking at is kind of out more towards the beginning of August. And you have to get through these front expirations markets, options markets are very active, maybe two, three weeks out. And that's because most people are looking for a bunch of liquidity, especially for bigger positions up in the front expiration cycles. Now, this five July expiration is interesting because we have a holiday that tends to lead to muted volatility and that's partially why you see these two vols, these two expiration vols being essentially the same. Typically, at least as of late with GameStop, the front expiration has almost always been higher. But this flattening is going to be largely in part due to the holiday that's coming up in the market bingla. When I look across the open interest in the five July's, there's nothing too interesting here. Now, I know a lot of",

When I look across the open interest in the five July's, there's nothing too interesting here. Now, I know a lot of people were talking about in the last expiration cycle, this call wall. And it's okay to call it that. But I think people were kind of mistaken the origin of it before I think it was at like the 125's and the 128's. They were thinking that it could be like institutions, scaling in positions and whatnot. And it can be, but based on the buying activity that I've been seeing in these really far out of the money strikes, I don't actually think it's in part large from institutions, but a lot of retail traders. So if I kill this size requirement, and if we only want to look at the out of the money, let's take a look at this front series, the five July's. And if we want to take a look at the furthest out of the money, there was what, the 95's. So if we take a look at the 95's, and we're only going to allow us to look at the 95's, so we'll be able to see clearly the buying activity around the 95's. Let's see what we see.

So this absolutely can be a lot of small positions being built by larger institutions, but it would still have to be much larger size than this. If you're an institution trying to place a larger trade, if you look at the largest trade on here, which came in at 220 lots at four bucks, it's less than a thousand dollar positions, 880. You'd essentially have to take all of this and it still wouldn't even be a fraction of the size needed for it to be like a quote unquote institutional position. This to me just looks like a lot of people speculating on far out of the money options because they're cheap and they're generally misguided on how these are likely to perform over the time frame. But this is just a ton of tiny little trades all the way out into next week, this coming Friday.

And part of it is probably due to the cycle analysis that people have done and they're trying to front run the moves, which is again, you can choose to try to bottom ticket in front run the move, but it's difficult to make money that way. Now I want to take a quick look at the 19th July expiration cycle because this is kind of like the next main active cycle because it is a primary standard expiration cycle as I've told you guys before. The weeklies they will still be active but they won't have the same activity that the primary expiration which is the third Friday of each month and that's because people are looking for liquidity and there are some pretty big positions here. So at the 25s there's 19,000 at the 30s there's 25,000. At the 40s there's 19,000 and as I say those numbers what do you notice? They're all kind of like round numbers, right? 25, 30, 40. Again, most larger trades are going to be done at these whole strikes and that again is for liquidity. So let's go all the way out here. We have a big block at the 125s, 35k and then at the 100s, 21k. So let's take a look at these 125s in 19 July and see what kind of activity is going on here. So",

So let's take a look at these 125s in 19 July and see what kind of activity is going on here. So we need to take this up to 125 and then we need to kill this series, go to this series. Let's see the size of these trades. The biggest one was 95. So again, just taking a quick look at the total value of that trade, 95 times 28 bucks, it's 2660, the small position, it's a 2,000 trade. That's the biggest one. If we go through and scroll down through these to take a look at what the general sizes of these trades. I see some 40s, some double digits. The vast majority I'm seeing are singles, triples doubles. That's what's jumping out to my eyes so far. And as I go through this, again, I see some tens, but still very small positions. These are at 20 cents. So what I'm highlighting is really the same thing I'm seeing in the near term expiration cycle of five to lies. This just looks like a lot of people putting on very small, highly speculative trades, hoping something hits. These are very small trades. So that doesn't mean that there's nobody large lurking. That's actually one of the biggest things that I'm keeping an eyeball on to see when we",

So that doesn't mean that there's nobody large lurking. That's actually one of the biggest things that I'm keeping an eyeball on to see when we do see some serious buying activity. I have all different kinds of scans that start kicking off. As soon as that happens, that's how I got alerted to Chewie last week. That's how I got alerted to GameStop in the beginning. Because I'm very interested in catching this stuff as it's going off. Because again, from me, primarily an option tradingers world, I'm just looking to make money on movement. I don't really care if it's up down sideways. I need movement in some capacity. So that's how I keep an eyeball out for these kinds of things. So more to come this week as we get through another shout out to Richard. I'm hoping that he and I can connect again. We're going to talk about maybe due to some sort of live stream. Because I feel like I have so many beginner questions that might be useful for other people's context. Kind of looking at the world of GME through beginners' eyes. And then I hopefully can help color in some lines around the option space, how we can use this. Because I do think that there's a piece here that we can use this for options, predictive",
