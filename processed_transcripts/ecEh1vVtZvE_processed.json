    "text": "When I started trading in 2007, things were a lot different. There wasn't information everywhere. Now, today, there is a whole other problem. There's information everywhere. It's actually information overload. So to overcome that as a trader, you have to develop a learning plan. Just like you saw in high school, college, whatever courses you've been to, there typically is a progression based on building block of skill sets. There's a syllabus that outlines what you're going to cover when. There's homework. There's reading. There's quizzes, tests, projects. There's different ways to evaluate your skill set. You have to do that for yourself. The thing about trading, the beauty and the drawback, is it's all on your own. There's literally nobody in here that's going to tell you what to do or how to do it. You have to figure it out for yourself. So embrace that ambiguity and create your own structure. Be an outlier, see you all later.",
