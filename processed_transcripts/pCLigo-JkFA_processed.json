I think that's it from like a performance perspective. If you guys have any questions, obviously, feel free to let me know. But the, yeah, the main stuff was, I was looking through my notes and trading activity did tick up a little bit. So total number of transactions did grow a little bit. It doesn't really surprise me to be honest with you just because of the earnings season and stuff like that. And I'm also trading more index of all. But I mean, it's just kind of business as usual as you can tell. It's not like some crazy cool return, right? It's very, very inside. But I pride myself in the consistency of returns. And that's really what will probably take me through the rest of the year because honestly to be up 20 within the first two months, like that's pretty strong. And I think a big reason for that really came from this last earning cycle. And then this pop in volatility from the broader market conditions have led to volatility trading really recapturing a pretty meaningful part of the percent return of the portfolio in a relatively short term timeframe.

This one says speculative coverage strangle, and that shouldn't be that. That should be speculative zero DT. And it's really speculative SPX more than anything because I've opened it, I've opened up that bucket a little bit. It's not just. It definitely not just zero DT's anymore. Actually, most of what I'm trading right now for index fall is not zero DT's. It still is zero DT's most days, but it's mostly a mix of a mix of things.

So general yes, but not. Not total like it's not just sitting at long deltas. It's definitely a pretty healthy mix of things as things are right now. And really the big reason for that is because we can see a lot of opportunity right now as far as I'm concerned at least from trading things through these broad directional shifts because here's a common thing that'll happen during periods like this. We will see a lot of opportunities emerge that do not remain super strong. And a big reason for that is because the markets will have this like really, really ugly kind of crash down phase to it, but then they typically will recapture. So when that happens, we have to obviously wait and see when that eventually comes to fruition.

And they will almost always, always, always slow down. Now how quick that comes today, we actually got a little bit of a continuation note, which I mean, I honestly think is fairly fortunate. And a big reason for that obviously is from the Trump tariffs, which actually there was a clip that I wanted to show you guys that reminds me, let me find it really fast. What's green in my own?

So the main thing I thought that was really interesting about this was a lot of the impression that it was almost like he's viewing the tariffs as kind of like a punitive function. And then it rotates into trying to complete the domestication of work. I don't know. I just thought it was really interesting. And the reason why I mentioned that point is because obviously the market also thought that this is a little strange because it seemed like with the tariffs being delayed a month, it seemed like there was going to be a path where the tariffs might be avoided. But then now it seems like that's not so much the case. So very, very interesting behavior across the board. But I mean, it is what it is. Now the interesting part about tariffs is that they do open the door to opportunities and trade opportunities to be all over the place from trying to trade index movements to finding individual names that are exhibiting strength, which there are still a lot to trading earnings. There's really so much to be done right now of note. However, if we take a look at Nvidia, that's pretty ugly. Like",

And this is now starting to challenge even these lows. So if this continues to post lows in this way, that's fairly catastrophic for what Nvidia has been able to accomplish over the last several months. But if you take a look, we've essentially undone six months. Right? Like this is where we opened six months ago and we just closed below it. So Nvidia is very, very much trending sideways here on a longer term timeframe. We can still obviously see tons of upside and lots of growth. But even if we go back almost a year ago, we've given up most of what we've created essentially since the end of April. So the general movement that we're seeing in tech is going to continue to drive the short term sentiment. But now the other cool part about this though is that I still overwhelmingly think the market is very well positioned, especially with AI. So that's why even when the market does start to look as ugly as it does right now, I just see such a massive catalyst sitting in front of us through something like AI that",

And the fact that there are still pockets of strength that still shows us that this is not like a a total market rollover. This is obviously a broad market pullback, but how far it shapes and materializes. I think we'll have a lot to do with a couple things. One of them. Absolutely will be the war in Ukraine and Russia. How that comes to pass and how impactful that that can be. And that is actually something to be really thoughtful about by the way. Because that that meeting between Zalensky and Trump was very interesting. That's not it's really not the way I expected that to go. I don't think it's the way most people expected it to go. But it didn't surprise me that it didn't go that well. And for those that don't know the president's a Lensky, he did a podcast with Lex Friedman. That was pretty good. Lex Friedman. I have a lot of respect for him. His podcast can be a little difficult to listen to. Maybe it's just because I'm not smart enough or I just think he's like very monotone. So anyways, my personal opinion is that nobody asked for a side. The reason why I offer that personal opinion here, by the way, is because if you feel that same way,",

And anyways, one of the things that came out of that podcast listening with Zalensky and Lex Friedman was that there is a lot of pent up aggression and issue, right. So with Ukraine and Russia, the problem with that though is that if the way to close this war out is through an agreement, it's very difficult to do that. If one side is really disenfranchised with the other side, that becomes very, very difficult to manage. And that's actually one of the things that Lex Friedman pointed out while on the podcast with Zalensky. And I can totally respect and understand Zalensky's perspective, but he's in a very precarious spot because Ukraine without external support is in a real, real precarious place. So the reason why I'm getting into all that one, obviously it's a personal interest of mine, just global security and stuff from a military mindset. But beyond that, if that war starts to meaningfully escalate, which is not off the table, I still generally view that is less likely than more likely, but it's not off the table.

And that's something I'm paying very close attention to because that is the exact kind of condition where my entire investment strategy would literally flip overnight if that happens. So I'm waiting to see the way it goes. Again, the way to think about markets as a trader is that we never know what's going to happen, but we have to have an idea of what we would do in different scenarios based on the broader context of what the world is doing. And so that we're not caught off guard because I can tell you exactly what would happen to the majority of retail traders who are kind of passively involved. If that war escalated, they do not have a playbook ready on what they would do. And it would take them a couple days to get their feet under them to figure out what to do with the portfolio as it sits to try to find new opportunities. And by that point, you are late to the dance. So anyways, all of that is an encouragement for you to prepare yourself. And again, we're not I'm not preparing myself for something that I view",

Now that stuff aside, that's one thing that can really change this broader market picture. The other thing, the good part with the tariffs is that I think a lot of what we're seeing in the short term is absolutely. Absolutely sentiment driven meaning most most large banks have already priced in most of this meaning the tariffs because these aren't things that popped up overnight. These are things that have been on the docket for the last month. And then if you paid attention during Trump's cabinet meeting, he talked a little bit about these and there was no talk about delaying them again, kicking them down the line. So I think most institutions had a sense of what's going on. And guess what? As per usual, the fucking options market tells you what's going on. And I didn't post about this because I was playing it myself. And we have seen rapid build out in VIX options over the last four days.

So if we take a look at VIX and if we take a look at the delicious clear out, let's take a look at very, very clear pricing. And let's take a look first at the last seven days. Take a look at the total premium that you're seeing across these long calls. And most importantly, pay attention to where what contract where they are. And then if you take a look for a prior reference range, if my computer would not freeze, we go to another reference range just for an example. We'll go not to November. We'll just go like somewhere in here. Notice the difference. I just picked a random time. So what I'm showing you is that if you develop a relationship with things, especially things like VIX, it is wildly telling, wildly telling. And you can see the build out occur near real time. You take a look at the total amount of premiums that have been purchased for relatively short dated calls.

I'm cherry picking because I can clearly tell some shit's going on. And this build out started again, like four or five days ago, you see it start on the 25th, 27th, and you can see it repeatedly getting hit. So the market provides for usual. So the trade here is really interesting because VIX obviously looks strong. But if you take a look at UVX Y, this is where my trade was. And it is for the leverage, the leverage we come in here for leverage. It's always likely to fall apart. And the cool part about trading a leveraged position is there's a higher probability of losing your trade. But you can lose less money because you don't have to put on as big of a position to get the same exposure. That's why I like something like UVX Y for this exact kind of idea, which is a very short term idea. And then the fun part about trading volatility is guess what?",

And then the fun part about trading volatility is guess what? I'm going to play it to the downside as well, typically not as profitable to be completely honest with you. Playing VIX spikes to the upside is always dangerous because if it takes too long, the market essentially will penalize you through theta decay. But trying to play the reversion is more challenging because everybody in their mother know it's we know it's going to revert. Whereas when the spike is going to happen, we don't know what it's going to happen. So it's a little more easy. If you get your move to make money to the upside to the downside, it's a higher probability of making the money, but you typically make less money. So that's the road map. Pretty easy stuff. As far as I'm concerned, now let's go back to the scan really quick. And I realize it's already 530 so I got to hop off in a minute.

Zach says today was rough did not see the sell off coming so much for me thinking we had bottom too much thinking with my heart probably. Yeah, well, and I mean the other thing is like we you just never know right like going into the market with an expectation of oh, like did we bottom here? It's okay, but also like what does that do for us? It's the role of a trader is always Bayesian analysis. That means we come up with the best possible mental model that we can until new information emerges and then we update the mental model. So to your point, I think just about all of us thought a similar thing to be completely honest, right? Like if we take a look at what the market did on Friday, if you look across everything here on Friday, just about everything. So that is the start of something now I think it's way too premature to think whether or not we bottomed or not there to be honest just because it's one day you really can't come up with the conclusion in one day, but with the start that we had to the market today, it looked probably. But then the tariffs came so when we have new information injects like that it's always going to be real challenging. And that's why it's so",

And that's why it's so important to remain as flexible as humanly possible as a trader it's literally our job. We have to be able to pivot rapidly because the markets move around a lot. So yeah, I think to your broader point though, avoid at all costs making trading decisions with emotions or you know, obviously your your your term there was the heart. We want to avoid that we want to use solid analysis that's based based on data. And you can get a lot of really great data points from the market. I mean, take a look at this healthcare had a great day today utilities great day today real estate taking up today staples taking up today. So again, like the market as an entire entity is not dying off right now, but tech is and as we know tech even with the SP 500 is over 30 of the SP 500 is huge.

Let's see Zach says what would your strategy be if that happens put options I think you're referring to when I was talking about if the war kicks up. It depends entirely on the context, but essentially what would end up happening in broad muscle movements would be coverage strangles would get paired down to minimal viable products. So what that means is for the coverage strangle I very rarely come flat to cash. But I get very close to cash now in something like T triple cues I do go flat to cash because it's three times levered and it's more of a speculative hybrid coverage triangle. I still consider it core. It's all bucketed together, but it's it is speculative in nature because it's three times leverage. So that's one of the first playbook items the other thing is things that benefit from war obviously start to get put on with leverage. So for example, the balance here position I have on I would expect that to do well I would expect the other defense contractors to do really well. I would also expect fixed income to do better debt instruments I would expect to see. A pair relationships get distorted that I would then play the normalization of those and then for broad directional movements it's straight to futures. Yeah anything like that straight to futures.

A birder says can you look at AVGO it is earnings this week and it looks like it'll do well, but I think the movement will be drowned out by the broader market movements we're seeing like in video. Well in videos earnings is a little bit of a different story to be honest if you're paralleling it to that. So I think it's a trail down into their earnings I think does them a favor it makes it easier to see some sort of up move. Let's take a look this six. Let's get rid of this. This chain looks generally built to the call side let's see. Yeah 58 against 42 so not massive. I mean it's for me to it's hard to say I think it's real hard to say I don't see a clear positioning with respect to the options chain though. We can look across and see if anybody has been building into anything in there. And then what direction they might be building into. Just making sure the filters are correct. Let's see. You can put 280 put I mean it looks like a lot of put activity to be on. Yeah it looks like a lot",

I don't need 15 minutes so excessive honestly if I could just look at this in terms of a day that would be fine. Yeah I mean I don't personally have some sort of baked opinion on how it'll do during earnings I don't see anything super conclusive though. Just eyeballing things. Had a really good last earnings. For earnings good earnings poor earnings poor earnings poor earnings poor earnings good earnings. Kind of like a mixed bag.

With the down move that we've seen so far like you'll literally see it. You'll see it happening. You'll see the total tone and tenor change. And you will see people's general perception about the external environment changing just in terms of tonality. And you'll obviously see it through price and volume. So that's one of the reasons why I mean even in the coverage strangles that I have on right now they're super light. I mean they're all 20 equity or less which is about as late as you can go I think most of them are 50 utilize or less. Let me see. The teacher accused coverage strangle is 63 ssso's 59 I bits 52. So. I mean most of that is in short puts 22 for ssso of that 59 is shares 17 of teacher book uses shares the rest isn't cash secured puts actually offered more puts today and it's to take advantage of the down move and I will almost assuredly have to roll these but that's OK.

    "text": "more puts today and it's to take advantage of the down move and I will almost assuredly have to roll these but that's OK. The volatility is there so just keep that in mind is your monitoring the market getting into like really big positions right now. If you have a really long term horizon it can look very good I'll go back and say again for the record like for Nvidia I love Nvidia all in here but that's for a much longer term idea. I think if you're trying to trading shorter term it doesn't it literally is crazy as it is to say doesn't make sense right now but if you're trying to build a longer term coverage strangle long equity position I mean you're probably not going to get a ton of good looks at Nvidia like this over the next five years it's just going to be growing way too fast based on the involvement in AI and whatnot. Now that is another key theme to keep in mind though the AI the AI theme is really really dangerous because if things work well then AI has an unbelievable amount of potential if there starts to if we if we start to see impediments and stuff like that you just cannot absolutely cannot rationalize the long term exposure in it and it's just because that's such a key market factor right now and if that starts to fall off then the broad market really starts",
