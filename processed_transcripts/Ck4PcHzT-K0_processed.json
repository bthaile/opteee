I want to understand the supplier relationships. We're going to get pretty far into detail on deepseek today just because it's a really interesting opportunity. It's an opportunity to explore because you now get a chance to see how the market is still so reactive. And this is important. The market being so reactive is still unbelievably fantastic from a volatility trading perspective. On fact, one of the reasons why I rotated specifically from Upro into SSO is because I ran an analysis on IV adjusted return on risk using the variance in implied volatility for the stock, the risk of the trades, and then the returns that I was seeing in the underlying and funny enough, with volatility so high, it's actually slightly more optimal to be an SSO versus Upro as it sits today. Now there's a little bit of a liquidity concern and stuff like that, but that's another story based on how we manage the position itself. So let's take a look at deepseek as a company. So I'm actually going to pull up deepseek stock overview",

I don't want most of these are tied funny enough to Nvidia. Everybody's worried about Nvidia because Nvidia obviously is at like the absolute front of this overall trilling decline on the market though. Huge, huge, huge decline on the day, which is actually kind of crazy. And then let's grab a couple more things. No, this one will look at this one will look at. So, this is from JP Morgan, I haven't read these yet, I just grabbed him right now. This says deepseeks latest AI model, PROMS market, friendsy, but investors should remember to stay the course. This obviously, okay, a quick admin note, think of the lens that we're talking about right now. We're talking about this from the lens of JP Morgan, which is a huge company that has a lot of clients. So right now they're trying to say to their clients, I'm fucked down, going to be all right. That's what they're doing right now. So really important to know that because I want to see what else they come up with, but let's let's go through here. All right.",

So today markets have been adjusting to a new threat AI model challenging many assumptions about technology dominance. Here's the thing. As we go through this, one important note, and this is not to get into like US versus China and all that stuff. I don't really care for that dialogue on this stream, but China isn't fully known for being the most forthcoming country that exists. We could they're not the most forthcoming about everything. So that being said, as there are a lot of these different claims related to the cost of training the model, the model's utilization of various chips and stuff. We kind of have to take some of that with a fucking giant grain of salt. Now the reason why that's being highlighted here is because whenever we look through different news sources, you have to identify the perspective and paradigm of whatever it is that we're looking at. So as deep seek part of China, China has a completely different media structure, different business structure. China is not known to be business friendly, that kind of stuff. There's going to be a lot of skew with what is being shared. It's the same thing.",

So when we're watching from a military perspective and you see China talking about coming up on a six gen fighter and then you look at it, you're like, bitch, that's not really a six gen fighter, but you know, that's what they're calling it. That's what the branding it. So it's I'm not saying that this isn't the case. This actually looks like there's a pretty significant amount of validity behind what they're saying. But we have to take some of this with a massive grain of salt in terms of training costs, training models, which is a really big focus for AI tools because training is super time intensive and expensive. So now as we pivot to reading an article from JP Morgan, this is a well look wealth management. It's literally telling you right up front what they are. They have clients money and right now they've been telling all their clients for the last year, bet the house on Nvidia. This is going to styroch it up because that's literally at the core of AI.

So the perspective of all of this stuff is really important to keep in mind. Okay. So let's continue deep seek a two year old Chinese startup launched its latest model early last week. That's when the model launched early last week, early last week. Why am I belaboring that point? Because early last week the market didn't give a fuck. Okay. The model is an open reasoning large language model LLM. So this is very, very similar to what we see from primary market offerings from domestic side from the US today. And it was developed using adaptations from Meta's open source LLM. Critically deep seeks latest model matches the performance of open AI's cutting edge models across math, coding and reasoning tasks at a reported approximately 95 discount to operate and train. Well, hot damn. That seems pretty sick, doesn't it? Pretty big deal. So let's continue. Oh, that's actually funny. I literally didn't even read this. What's the big deal?

Oh, that's actually funny. I literally didn't even read this. What's the big deal? The market is worried that their cost efficiency threatens the assumed dominance in valuation premium that leading US semiconductor infrastructure companies have enjoyed. Indeed, some of the stocks that are taking the biggest hits so far, these different companies, some of the hyper scalars who were driving AI capital expenditures are down on the day, but outperforming the stocks that are more levered to AI infrastructure. So here's the next question. How is it that the large language model itself is causing semiconductor and infrastructure companies to contract? The large language model itself still requires semiconductors and infrastructure in order to do the thing as an LLM. Another really important relationship to pay attention to as we continue working through this. Concentration of the US large cap stock market and mega cap names is a risk facing investors in 2025. This is talking about the centralization of mega cap as a percentage of the overall stock market, which is a massive number. I don't know what it is today. I'll find out for you right now at a curiosity. What percentage I'm asking, ChatGPT? What percentage of the US stock market cap is accounted for by mag seven companies?

What percentage of the US stock market cap is accounted for by mag seven companies? Actually, I don't know the answer to this right now. Let's see what GPT comes up with. They account for 35 of the SP 500 market capitalization. And then for those that don't know, the SP 500 represents about 80 of the total stock market capitalization. So those seven companies represent just shy of 30, like 28 or 20, I don't fucking know, high 20. So this is an important element to outline without a doubt. And this is something that is going to be brand new, especially for people that are used to approaching this whole thing from an investor standpoint, from an investor standpoint, you're taught by an index ETF. It's diversified. But now when you buy an index ETF, you're kind of getting 35 of the same shit. That's not super diversified based on the original principles. That's actually why you see a rise in the utilization of like equal weighted SP 500 indices and stuff like that. Because some people are starting to get a little nervous about the hyper concentration. So just another note to keep in mind. Okay, let us continue.

It's levers that your friend, if you have a friend will pull, move the holds out of the way. Anyways, that's a monolith, which is different than monolith. Jevons Paradox states that increased efficiency can lead to increased consumption of a resource. Lower cost for AI models could lead to faster. This is exactly what I was thinking. Could lead to faster adoption by corporations and households. Further, the drop in the headline stock index masks some encouraging performance underneath the surface. The average stock is down only 15 basis points that are up. This is, it's literally funny and I have to be honest. I also didn't know that it was called Jevons Paradox, but this is exactly what's one of the points I've wanted to share with you at least from my own perspective, which apparently now is known as Jevons Paradox, where increased efficiency typically leads to increased consumption because you can apply it in more places net,",

So the overall 95 growth and efficiency, first of all, is great because that means other AI tools are also going to search to be as efficient as humanly possible. And my expectation is that I don't think anything in China is going to be so incredibly disparate from what's available here in the US. So then that means they're going to be jockeying back and forth, who's in the lead, who's slightly behind. But all of that as the overall field of AI grows in terms of adoption scope, that's going to benefit all of these different AI companies. They're all going to become smarter, more efficient, better deployed. And then it's going to impact other areas of the economy, which is a big factor for this entire move that you see today and the expectation. So again, to reiterate, right now to me, it looks like short term sentiment got caught off sides. After hours, e-minis are up just a little bit.

There are still many unanswered questions to the validity of the model, the true cost to train it and its implication for US tech firms. Huge.

This is important because I still believe that our processors are superior to theirs. So even if they found a way to be more efficient with what they have, that means that what's potential for us is huge. Think of it as the five minute mile. I think for everybody for the longest time, everybody thought that the five minute mile just couldn't be broken. And then some dude, I don't know who it was, ended up breaking the five minute mile eventually. And then as soon as he broke it, motherfuckers started breaking the five minute mile, not regularly, but way more than before. So there becomes a mental barrier that becomes broken once we see that something is possible and doable. Think of it even from the perspective of being a full-time trader.

So then that lets you know that the shit is doable. It's the same thing here. So if we see something like deep seek being way more efficient using less optimal processors, what does that tell you? What's a potential for better technology? It's so facto. So the Chinese firm says it built its systems for less than six million. Sure. Versus the billion spent by rivals. It's also much cheaper to operate than open AI and meta. So the news comes after US venture stargate announced plans to spend as much 500 billion on AI infrastructure. Silicon Valley venture capitalist Mark Andreessen described deep seek deep seek R1 as AI's sputnik moment, which I actually agree with that. I think that that's really, really, I think it's a great analogy. When the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite in 57 kicking off the space raised.

They came up with more efficient methods to train its models such as using custom communication schemes between chips, reducing the size of fields to save memory and innovative use to the mix of models approach according to wired article. The other reality here is if you think about it from a legal perspective, even what things have access to train off of is going to be completely different because again, China is more dictatorial. So they can essentially just say that they models can train off whatever the fuck they want. As in the US, there is a ton of legal battles going on right now about what the models can or can't use because we actually shocker somewhat value the individual autonomy over their own information. So that's not directly tied to size of fields, different communication schemes, but that is another element to bake into this. Now",

Ever core ISI analysts emit, that's a fucking name, dare, dare, y'all, nanny, dare, dare, dare, y'all, nanny said in a client note Monday, we think some of the risks near term will be around do we need to spend as much catbacks given a cheaper alternative?

This couldn't agree with anymore. Deepseek panic seems overblown and this will lead into what opportunities are probably here for us.

Certainly could. Deepseek impact on the AI technology supply chain all depends on the veracity of deep seaks claims. Now the funny thing is the market is obviously treating the claims with significant respect. Big, big respect. So it seems like they do believe that there is at least some degree of merit.

So a couple of things we did in the NASDAQ roll over to net lows and in the New York stock exchange also rolled over to net lows. This is representative of a broader change in breadth as compared to what we've been seeing previously. Port and no. We can see volatility popped and volatility contracted. I had a short trade in volatility once it broke above 20 and a half.

That's an important note. G36 says for the efficient market hypothesis asset prices need to reflect all information. That's incorrect.

G36 says that's the definition. It's not. That's not the definition. They're talking about one of the forms of efficient market hypothesis. There are three forms.

Another trade that I put on today from the stream yesterday went on because we were looking at financials and financials were looking good. So they continue to run pretty effectively here. Financials gap down on the day staples. Who saw this coming? Staples. We have to take a look at staples and see what's going on in there because they finally caught a bid and interestingly enough discretionaries up at the same time. Curious. Utilities we already talked about down real estate slowly trending up and then healthcare is also on a pretty big run. Healthcare is actually starting to challenge these term highs, which would actually indicate on a short term time frame turning around within that sector. So actually very interesting movement between here and here.

This is looking at the Nasdaq exchange and this is used looking at the New York stock exchange. But even on the Nasdaq exchange, there's a lot of tech companies that tends to skew a bit more tech. So that's why you see this declining more so than you see on this side in case you didn't know. So if we take a look on a five day time frame, there's a big, big dip in companies that are making new lows, which is interesting. I'll start with saying interesting. The reason why that's interesting to me is the market is in a very delicate state. I'm going to make a change right now in my opinion based on what I've seen based on my overall analysis of stuff. And this is a little weaker than I would have expected to see. And then you can see on the number of companies that are above five day moving average, that dropped like 11 points as compared to the 20 day. And then it's compared to yesterday.

And I want to take a look. AI stock opportunity. I'm just updating our timestamps. And let's take a look specifically. I think Nvidia is going to be probably one of the bigger ones. So Nvidia fell directly down essentially to its 200 day moving average. And if we zoom out, go back a little further out in time. I mean, it's clearly down through this area of prior support, now likely turned resistance. Although I think that the reaction that you'll see here for Nvidia through resistance will be very, very different than other companies that are essentially trying to find their name and trying to find their value. My overarching expectation here is that I think Nvidia looks so good here. I think that even for a moderate duration trade, this looks so good here. And I already have exposure to it through T triple cues. I actually expanded my T triple cues position today, not a ton, but slightly. And there's a bunch of different reasons for that one from the",

And I think Nvidia looks really good here. Now it doesn't look good in my opinion to buy yet. The reason why it doesn't look good to buy yet is because whenever we have companies that have these big kind of gaps down, we have to wait until the dust settles just a little bit before we start running out and seeing if we can prospect on a position. Because single down days like this big gap down, it is a fucking crap shoot. What this can look like tomorrow. It is a crap shoot. We really, really don't know.

And I would want to see how it trends above first the 125 handle at least. And then how it does as it approaches the 130 handle. And then if it looks like it's doing well in their getting support, we're seeing volume expanding. And we're seeing the internals looking strong. Then yeah, no problem playing this as a reversal to the upside. This is essentially a mega cap version of a parabolic long, which is kind of crazy to think about because that's not how that's supposed to work with mega cap companies. But this, this. It is what it is big news today and big news absolutely move the stock. So let's take a look at the options still as huge call skew. And let's take a look at the volume for today.

So that doesn't surprise me in the least. But there's still a ton of people that are buying calls today, 34 of the transactions where people buying calls. So the market is not overly scared right now. At least from Nvidia's perspective, the other thing to keep in mind with Nvidia is that it had a truly parabolic ascent. And again, for really big companies, this is somewhat unnatural. So if you go back to 2023, take a look. 2023 on a split adjusted basis is trading at 1376. I mean, that's an insane move for a company of this size. So when you see companies move this big, this heavy, a lot of times you will find that they're going to take a step back at some point and they need to consolidate a little bit. So this I think just happened to be exacerbated by the news that came out. But this in no way in my opinion changes the total fundamental value of the company.

It's just a matter of exercising a little more patience, taking a tactical pause, seeing how it actually pans out over the next couple days. But my expectation is that whenever it does decide to catch a bid, it will probably move up pretty quickly because lots and lots of people want to be in Nvidia because again, regardless of what's happening on this short term window, people look at Nvidia as the center of the party or AI and it's positioned its self be so. So yeah, I think they're still positioned really, really well. So let's take a look at a few other things that had pretty big moves today. I'm just scrolling through. We'll take a look at it first actually just from like a tech perspective. There it goes. And let's see what head of the biggest drops. Broadcom down huge 17 Oracle down 13. Let's take a look at these. So the general kind of ideas that we're looking at right now are really wrapped around the reversals and the nature of playing reversals is super, super",

So the general kind of ideas that we're looking at right now are really wrapped around the reversals and the nature of playing reversals is super, super delicate. And the reason why it's so delicate is because we never know if there's going to be continuation and you have to be careful if there's continuation. So when we're trying to play reversals, at least the way that I play reversals is it's typically really, really defensive. And I don't want to step in front of the momentum, but I want to be prepared to monitor a change in momentum and then eventually the broader expectation, which is a reversal. So let's take a look at some of these other AI prominent stocks. So first we could take a look at just broadcommatic curiosity. So broadcom is different. Broadcom is different. To me, I actually favor this a bit more to the downside. Man, look at this. There's just fucking nothing here. Very interesting. You can look at the volume. Yeah, see, and you can see, you can take a look at the options markets fucking tell you. Take a look at this. The majority of puts were bought. The majority of calls were sold and there's a very small minority of calls that were actually bought. This tells you right away what the market is thinking for",

Let me know if there's individual names that you won't want to take a look at. And we have maybe like 10, 15 minutes left. So if there's any questions that you want to hit, now's the perfect time. I actually want to make a quick announcement for the leader board in the discord. So for those that don't know, we have a completely free discord to join. And one of the things I'm doing to support people, but then also to help people interact and help one another share information. I am doing a monthly giveaway. And it'll go to one of the top 10. It'll be random if you're in the top 10. I mean, maybe I should be eligible. But the two things you can want is just like a 10 Amazon or Starbucks gift card.

So congrats to you guys so far. We'll essentially a pick on the last day of the month. So shout out to you guys running at the front of the pack. Okay. The other thing that I want to take a look at now though is the pro workbook. And then I just want to see if there's any questions from the pro members fast. So Amadez is asking, could you run through the pros and cons of a poor man's covered call? Specifically, I was thinking one for cues or TQs, which I suppose then begs the question of comparing covered strangle to a poor man's covered call. I see. This is a completely great question.

That's the that's the cliff notes version. So the way to think through this and to decipher. If you want to trade the poor man's covered call, or if you want to trade a covered strangle, comes down to leverage and holding duration. Because the other reality of this is let's say that you want to have a slightly longer or shorter holding duration. That's actually a pretty big impact in terms of when we think we might want to base the position or put the position on. So yeah, completely great question. But that's the that's the cliff notes version. I realize I need to add a link to the stream for these people so that they can easily find it. We don't want that. We want that. So yeah, that's the answer. It comes down to holding duration. If I'm holding something for a longer period of time, then I can either go really far out with the base of the ratio called the Agnol. But the main element is do you want the leverage or not? That's the big difference. Now the other thing with the poor man's covered call for those that don't know that's long typically people will do it at the money, which is different than what I do. The other recommendation I",

So we're caught up on the pro cues now happy to dive into really anything else that you all want to take a look at or you all want to talk about. James says eBay for breakout. Let's take a look. No. Definitely not. The reason why definitely not is a few reasons prior earnings had a good earnings release, but then a really big gap down. So I don't like that. I also don't like this massive gap up and then a run down. That doesn't mean that this still can't be traded to the upside. It certainly can, but this would not be bucketed as a breakout strategy for me personally. So yeah, that's my that's my point of two. And then I got to let Falco be answered as question. What",

G 36 is if you want to go long options, then you may want IV to drop unless you expect IV to expand further. Did you say I'm confused? I don't know what that's in response to. Oh, here we go. Amir says, Hi, Eric, what do you mean by waiting for the dust to settle before trading? Is there a way to measure that in terms of waiting for the IV to drop? Yeah. So what I'm referring to, Amir, that's a great question is I'm referring specifically. I think we were talking what about Nvidia. Is that correct? I realize that I missed that question from up above. Amir, let me know if that's the correct reference that we were talking about in video. Yeah. Okay. Cool. Thank you. Yeah. So what I'm talking about waiting for the dust to settle, I'm talking about the price action. I'm talking about waiting to see if price starts to show continuation or if price starts to show reversal or consolidation.

So waiting for the dust to settle, taking a tactical pause, it's the same thing. It's just waiting and it's watching because one of the worst things people can do from a trader's perspective is start jumping in now. If you start jumping in now, you could time it perfectly and that would be great. You could completely miss time it and tie a bunch of money up and then have to just deal with your money being in a trade that's not working well, get stopped out too fast. And there's generally little reward for trying to take the entry that fast. So what I mean by that is generally speaking, not always, you will give up some edge here in terms of perfect pricing, but you're balancing perfect pricing with probabilities. So what this means is the probability of you picking the exact turnaround point in the middle of a move is not really great. That essentially comes down to how well could you possibly gauge and understand market sentiment, which I think to elucidate that point further, how many of us expected in video the company to be down 17 today? I didn't. I expected it to be down for sure. That's why I was trading short e-minis, but I didn't expect 17. That's a big fucking move. So the point I'm showing you",

So the point I'm showing you is that even though even somebody like me that's pretty experienced at this stuff, I had a hunch. I had an idea that direction was moderately correct, but the severity would have been way off. I definitely wouldn't have even expected 10. So the severity of my assumption was way off. So the point there is, it's really difficult to tell when the turnaround is actually there if there's a turnaround. So rather than trying to what we would refer to as a bottom ticket, meaning getting the best lowest price before it starts to reverse, we can just wait and we can see how it behaves and a great reference is something like this here, right? Just use this as a model red down day. So it had a gap down, had a big, big red down day, and then the next day, gap down again, rallied up, rallied back down, and it trended sideways for like five days. Now again, if you're an investor, who gives a shit? If you're an investor, this is great. From an investor's perspective, this move is fantastic.

That's the nature of investing. So if it's a long-term position from an investor's perspective, they might not care if it goes from 118 down to 90, because if they're going to look at it in eight, ten years, it'll probably be higher in eight, ten years. It could have a period where it looks really ugly in the mean term. So from an investor's lens, very different from a trader's lens, because from a trader's lens, if I want to trade this to the long side, why the fuck would I get in now as it's going down? I need to wait and see if it's going to consolidate, if it's going to start rallying because it could continue to keep going down. Now what do I sack her face by doing that? Well, I'm not going to bottom-ticket. I'm not going to get the exact lowest point before it starts to rally. I'm naturally going to give that up.

So going back to this example, stock dropped, gap down the next day, inside day, another day, kind of sideways, dropped, then it started consolidating again, and then you have a little bit of an update. Then you have another pretty big confirmatory update. As these three updates are occurring, you can see that the volume is slightly expanding, but it's by side volume. So this is the entire nature of trading is to keep an eyeball on what it's doing, analyze it, and then make a trading decision based on just the overall performance of it. So here what I can tell you is volume contracting. Cell-side volume expanding, then today massive cell-side volume expansion. So this so far, this doesn't look good. Now just because it landed on this volume node, that starts to look okay. I don't love that it closed below the 200-day MA, but the MA's, there's no specific magic that happens here. And then if we zoom this out to understand broader points of control, most people are making a ton of money on this thing. So they don't give a shit.

The only people that would be moderately unhappy right now are the people over the last three months that have been transacting at 137 and now it's at 116. But even those people aren't that upset. So the entire concept of waiting for the dust to settle or taking a tactical pause is from a trader's lens. And that's when we wait and see what does it do here? Does it continue? Does it consolidate? Does it start to go up? And then we make a trade decision based off of that. But trying to make a directional trade decision off of one big counter-move day is really difficult and it's super low probability. So that's the general idea. Really, really great question.

So to finish that is, that is good. The first one. I forgot the first one. Travel, Urzal. That's my best guess. So the way that we can see if this is recovering is if it starts to consolidate. If we start to see buy side volume stepping in, if we see continuation of elevated volume but prices appreciating, that is really, really positive marks for something that's starting to catch its legs. So for example, here, this isn't the time to buy from a trader's lens. This isn't the time to buy. This isn't the time to buy. This isn't the time to buy. This isn't the time to buy. This could be a time to buy. And for this one, we wouldn't have gotten stopped out. So this entry could have been fine. Now, let me take a giant step back, completely armchair quarterbacking.

Now we want to see buy side volume coming in. We want to see price setting in a floor and then staying away from the floor wherever that is. We want to see accumulation occurring and then we want to see price obviously starting to move up. Now you can also overlay short term moving averages here, five day, nine day, ten day, whatever makes you happy. Typically something this short would be better with like a five day and then a midterm moving average of 20 days, something like that. And I also can use something like a RSI with a seven day VWAP moving average to understand what the overall strength of this basing is. So for example, as the stock is trending sideways here, if we take a look at the RSI, we can actually see that RSI is positive sloping. So that's a divergence between the oscillator and the stock price. That's typically a clue. That doesn't mean that price is going to turn around, but it's a clue. So the nature of the game in terms of this timing component is our job as traders is to apply our",

So the nature of the game in terms of this timing component is our job as traders is to apply our skill set. And then in this case, the skill set is technical analysis to identify what we think is most likely to occur. Now you can apply a even simpler analysis and just use options pricing and option pricing captures a lot of it. But that's the general overview of how to see something that's basing. And then in the process of recovery before entry, another good question. Why not ask to look at so far in Christian as first to look at Tesla. So let's take a look at Tesla. Resilient today. It has earnings coming up on the 29th. Let's see how it's positioned for earnings. And then let's grab O rats to look at prior earnings, 3 mil against 2.7. So people are pretty bullish in Tesla. Let's do. So from an earnings lens, it essentially is never within the move. This actually would be great for a long straddle, to be honest, a little bit late. But this is one that I actually would trade a long straddle in pretty happily. And what I'm referring to for those that don't know is this. I'm essentially analyzing, this is looking at the last 12 moves, but something",

And then we can see obviously the overall stock price movement. So the vast majority of these post release, we can see that. I mean, the majority of them implied false short. So yeah, this would be a pretty easy long straddle style position for earnings itself. Let's take a look at how it's positioned for earnings itself, which is just this week. We can get rid of all this other stuff. Three 16 on the call side against 257 on the puts. So people definitely are favoring the call side. And let's take a look at the wall surface. No surprise favoring the put side, which is pretty standard. We can see a couple kinks a little further out. But mostly pricing downside, which I don't think in this case actually means downside. I think that's more just standard. Vault positioning leading leading into the earnings release. So for earnings, it looks like people are positioned moderately bullish. Vault favors the downside a little bit, pretty standard fare for something like this. I can tell you what the event",

I can tell you what the event wall itself is. Give me one sec. I have a calculator for this. So the stock price is 39715. The event experee vol is 112.89. The ticker vol itself is 68.63. 68. I don't know why I said 63. I'm in it. It's 68.3. And this expression right now is four. So this is looking at like a 9.7 expected move in terms of the straddle that puts it out of 38.5 point move. The event wall itself is like 192. So the event the event volatility is huge on this one, which is fully to be expected. Let's take a look at it from a longer term perspective, which looks good. From a longer term perspective, it looks good. I don't like this near term price movement on this short term time frame like this doesn't look great. Like I don't love that and it definitely looks like it's generally. Unfortunately following that, which is rolling over a little bit. Obviously it broke out to the downside here. So now for this, it looks more so like how does it behave against that is the next question for me. It's sitting on a small volume node right here. So",

So now for this, it looks more so like how does it behave against that is the next question for me. It's sitting on a small volume node right here. So there are people interested in transacting here. So near term price expectation for me would be to probably oscillate sideways into earnings and then if it has a good earnings, I actually expect another round of post earnings announcement drift. That was a position that I traded actually on the last earnings release here because of how strong of a gap up it had post earnings. So yeah, that's a overview at least of what Tesla looks like. Big A says I was thinking higher IV would make the premium cost more and if you wanted for cheaper long options, you could buy more my mistake. Let me get caught up here. What big A's? What are you referring to here? You lose the bottom tick but once it settles the IV should be lower or going for long encounter against any lost gains. Are you talking still about Nvidia? And are you talking about the concept of waiting and the impact volatility? I'm just trying to piece together. I'm piece together where we're at. Correct. I was replying to recent yes, waiting to buy it. I see. And what are you talking about with respect to the volatility here?",

I was replying to recent yes, waiting to buy it. I see. And what are you talking about with respect to the volatility here? Are you saying like one of the main reasons to wait to buy is because the volatility would be higher and waiting for the volatility to contract or something else because if that's what you're saying, I actually would disagree with that and I can show you why. Because RIS says high IV just means people are expecting it to move which is a bad thing. So RIS, that angle is correct. One guiding feature on it though is that when IV is high, that means that you are absolutely paying more for it. So then if IV does contract, it can impact your position. It means that you have to be directionally correct. You're waiting being directionally correct more so. Big A says yeah, I thought if you waited the volatility would contract so I guess I'm wrong. No, that's not wrong. If you wait the volatility likely would contract, but at least from the lens that I was talking about buying potentially for the example of buying options here is that just wouldn't be like a major input into the decision is all.

But the assumption of if you hold off, volatility would probably calm down a little bit. I actually think that that's completely fine. That's correct. That volatility, it doesn't matter that much and I'll show you why for two reasons. The first one is if you look in the near term volatility for Nvidia right now, it's at 112. For a lot of the conversations that we would have here in terms of buying volatility, most people at least understand my approach to buying premium which would have us go out at the very least 60 days. So that would put us in the 17 April at the earliest. What do you notice about the 17 April vol compared to this near term vol? The 17 April vol is 62. It's already much lower than all this front vol. It's because it's further out in time. So even though Vega can have a decent impact here because you're going further out in time and because as of right now, it looks like more of a near term move, the volatility here still to be very clear would be impacted, but it's not as much as this front vol. So to your broader point, if in video, let's just say in video, started trending sideways, you",

So to your broader point, if in video, let's just say in video, started trending sideways, you will notice that these two vols, well, three vols specifically, explorations would probably contract a lot. You won't see this one contract as much. You'll still see a contract, but not as much. And you can get a sense of what nominal vol typically is, which is about 56. So if we're looking at these 80s, the nominal vol typically is 56. This is at 62. So you can see that you're looking at maybe like a 6 overall change in vol, which if you get the direction correct, that will overwhelm that change in vol every day of the week. So that's a really good inference that you're seeing. And I hope that looking at that helps connect a couple more dots on making like that kind of decision, because what you're talking about there is correct. But I would consider that level of analysis, kind of like late stage beginner analysis, because you're taught that if volatility or if stock price starts to flatten out, that volatility will contract, which is not wrong. But to take that thought process one step further, we want to think more so about the volatility surface and nominal volatility relative to terms.",
