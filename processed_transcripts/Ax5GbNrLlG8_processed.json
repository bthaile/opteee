    "text": "This is perhaps one of the most important mindset shifts you can make as an option straighter. Is re-configuring your mental model of analysis away from predictive expectations and focusing more on Bayesian analysis? Bayesian analysis is simply where we take all the information we have at a given point in time and we come up with an expectation of what might happen in the future in a probabilistic lens. I think the market is more likely to go up in the next week than down maybe 55 edge to going up. And it's generally based on some sort of analysis. But what happens is commonly traders get way too attached to their idea and then they become reluctant to abandon the idea. And that's just to your own detriment. As a trader, your job is to integrate new information as it comes in into your idea. If there's information that forces you to reconsider the original premise, just reconsider it. Let go of the ego and focus more on regularly updating the way you view things based on new information, getting entrenched in something you previously analyzed and thought it to be true doesn't matter. It matters what's happening and being sensitive to that. Be an outlier sealer.",
