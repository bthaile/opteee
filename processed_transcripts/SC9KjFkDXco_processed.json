    "text": "This video is going to walk you through how you can build your own long box spread tracker. This spreadsheet will help you understand what the annualized return of the trade you're looking at is it will help you track your previous trades and it even has a tool built in that lets us see the current yield curve so that you can pick where you want to buy your box spreads meaning loan the market to money. So what's up everybody air cure shout out to the patreon family and specifically for you guys a copy of the spreadsheet will be available in the patreon shop so if you are silver or above you get it for free. Otherwise there's a free option you can follow along with me and build it for yourself to walk you through how to make for yourself and then most importantly I want to make sure though we have a rudimentary understanding so long box spreads is when we are buying them that means our cash and sweep is going to decrease by the debit and then the profit at the end of the trade at expiration is going to be the width of the spreads. So let's take a look at what that looks like. If we take a look at this box spread in spx we want to balance a couple things I typically tried to go wider apart so that I don't have to put on so many but you",

If we take a look at this box spread in spx we want to balance a couple things I typically tried to go wider apart so that I don't have to put on so many but you go you don't want to go too wide where you run out of liquidity because notice how this strike here has 56,000 open interest that is from a lot of people doing box spreads so when I'm looking for my strikes I specifically want strikes that strike that balance well pun not intended. So in this case I want to do a million dollar worth box spread so that means I'm going to do 1000 points wide and 10 of those. The way to think about the value of the box spread is it's just going to be the width of the spread. So in this case I'm going to look at the 4500s I would be buying this call I would be selling this put the 4500 then if we go all the way to the 5500 down here you'll notice that these are thinner in terms of open interest but not anemic there's still something here so in this case we would be selling this call buying this put that gives you this position down here. Now if we take a look at the risk profile for this notice how at expiration it has a fixed profit in",

Now if we take a look at the risk profile for this notice how at expiration it has a fixed profit in this case it's 595 that is what the amount of money you are going to get back at the end of the trade now. Click admin note it is really important to use European style options that are cash settled both of those traits are important here because early assignment completely changes the risk profile you can have a big loss because of that and then if it's not cash settled and you can take the underlying that also can lead you long shares short shares that kind of thing which we don't want. So European cash settled. Okay. What fits that bill? SPX. Why I typically use SPX. So now let's take a look at the tool itself. This down here is just a yield curve and again the reason why I include this for you is so that you can get an idea of where you might choose to buy your box spread depending on what your goals are. The other thing is if you're looking to sell a box spread receive a loan maybe you go further out where it's cheaper. This is inverted right now compared to what it typically is normally you'll see the yield",

This is inverted right now compared to what it typically is normally you'll see the yield curve in contango where deeper expirations are going to have or yeah deeper expirations are going to have a higher yield and then near term inverse but notice how the near term stuff is actually higher yielding than the future dated stuff that's because we're in backwardation in terms of yields and that's just a sign of the current environment which is quite anomalous. So I wouldn't make any big decisions off of what you're seeing in this now because again it's different than what it will be kind of long term. This is the current yield for all these different durations. The reason why I picked this for you guys is because if you go to this website right here you can just copy and paste them and just drop them right in and then this will automatically update off of that. Okay. So that's the little yield curve for you. Notice how I have current risk free rate up here. The reason why this is important is because if we use different duration box spreads with different days to expiration that means we need to use for more accurate comparison the corresponding duration. So in this case we're",

The reason why this is important is because if we use different duration box spreads with different days to expiration that means we need to use for more accurate comparison the corresponding duration. So in this case we're looking at a box spread that's 38 DTE. In this example then we're somewhere in here. You could pick the midpoint between these two which would give you 5.42 so maybe we update this to be 5.42 and that's your number. This is what we're going to compare the box spread against over here to see net fees if we're doing better. So what's the trade? Well on today six fab we're looking at that 38 DTE. Notice how these are in light green. Notice how I tell myself these are cells I'm to fill in and then the stuff that is not like that you don't have to fill that in. So 10 lot this gets me the size that I want the long call and the short call the reason why I have these two selected is because these are the two different strikes and the puts are just going to be the inverse. So for example the long call notice how that's the same as the short put and then the short call the long put shares that strike. So these can just be pulled directly from that the net premium this is how much am I",

So these can just be pulled directly from that the net premium this is how much am I buying the box spread for how much my loaning out. So then all of this is automatically calculated which you can follow along. So we already went over those two days expiration is just the difference between these two days and trade is how long we've been in the position. The width of the strikes is this year the reason why I calculate that is so that I can see both the loan value which is down here and then the loan out. So the difference between loan out and loan value is simple loan out is how much did I what was the debit what did I actually buy loan value is how much is this worth that expiration and then that gives you your PNL once we factor in the fees. So it is really important to include the fees here. I have it hard coded right now to be it's four legs every time I have it set to 50 cents a leg which I think is common for people and I'm assuming we're taking it to expiration. If you're planning on managing it before expiration you can either adjust your inputs so that it's variable but",

If you're planning on managing it before expiration you can either adjust your inputs so that it's variable but for me when I'm putting these on my assumption is that I'm going to expiration. The reason why the fees matter so much in this case is because if we get rid of it take a look at the annual return right now it's five six eight one it goes to five seven oh one that's a meaningful difference. So especially if you're doing smaller box spreads these fees become really problematic if you're not paying attention. So then we already did the PNL which is all of this notice how I aggregate the open trades up here. So right now I have the spreadsheet set so that you can essentially build out having four box spreads on you can always add more if you want I typically don't have more on than two but the drag here is telling you how much the fees are relative to what you would be making sans fees. So you can see the math for that there I'm taking the fees and then I'm figuring out what I would have made without them that's your drag percentage of your PNL.

Return on invested capital is how much you're actually going to earn on the money you're putting out. So in this case if I'm putting out 994,100 I'm going to get 50, 80 back that's my return on invested capital. Now you can annualize the rate of return which is how you compare apples to apples against these. So in this case you can see the current risk rate is five four two the annualized return for this box spread is five six eight one and you can see over the risk rate you're getting about a quarter point and that's for your troubles of putting on this trade it is not as simple as just buying one of these. So there's got to be some sort of compensation here. Now the closed PNL appears actually just summarizing all of these closed positions over here. So the way that this works is whenever this trade comes up and it's done what I do is I just control C you can drop it over here I paste it as values and you're off to the races. So the reason why I do it this way is it keeps a clean view over here it lets me track all the previous positions it lets me",

Take a look at the width for this spread. The midpoint is 99420 the natural is over the width of the strikes which you would never do this for more the width of the strikes. So in this case you would you have to work this trade and you have to work all of the legs. You can either choose to do them individually or you could work the spread as a whole. I tend to find working the legs individually is the most effective you just have to be very careful about pricing that way.
