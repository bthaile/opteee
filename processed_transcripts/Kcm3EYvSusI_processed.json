Just the functional difference between open interest, aka, OI, and volume. Feel free to throw your answer in the chat. We'll take a look, see what you think, the correct responses. I imagine most of you will be familiar with it. Each says OIs, the total number of open contracts, volume number, traded hands today. Yeah, I think that's good. I think that's a good overview. Now a couple other notes to build onto that. Porx says liquidity. It's not liquidity. It can definitely represent a level of liquidity, but open interest simply represents the number of existing contracts. So if we take a look at spy and we take a look at the options chain and we go all the way down here to the bottom, you'll see that there's open interest and that looks exceedingly low. I do not believe that that's correct. That seems much more correct. So the open interest right now for spy on the call side is 6.5 million and on the put side it's 11.9 million. Those are the number of contracts that exist today and currently are open, meaning there are two parties to that trade that are choosing",

Those are the number of contracts that exist today and currently are open, meaning there are two parties to that trade that are choosing to maintain their position. Now volume represents the number of contracts traded and we can look at volume over different time frames. Volume today, we look at option volume over a rolling five day period to assess if something's becoming more active and so on and so forth. Volume doesn't differentiate whether or not it's an opening or closing position. So of this 5.8 million calls that were traded today, we do not yet know how many of those are opening positions versus closing position. We will see that reflected tomorrow. Then interest updates overnight and then the next day it will not change all day. Open interest will be whatever it is all day regardless of how much volume there is and then once we see where that volume goes throughout the day, then the next day it will update. So open interest essentially updates overnight and then it's static during the day volume is essentially the inverse. It's going to move all day as people are trading, but then overnight there's not going to be volume. It's going to zero out and then it will open back up the next day.

The reason why we need to know the difference between these two things is because they mean different things and the way that we might use them for information, rocker is different. Next question, how can we use volume over OI? This essentially creates a ratio and for those that are a little more visual while you're answering that, I'll show you right now. We'll go into a specific option, change this to I'm going to go further out in time because it will be lighter, it won't be as much, it will be easier to show you. Let's do this one. I think this is a good example. So in this option chain and for this option specific, let me, oops, let me click it so that you can see the one I'm looking at. We are eyeballing this bad boy. And then I think yellow will be visible. So let's take a look. So we can see that the volume right now is 317 volume. Even interest currently is 159. So we can create a ratio. We can say volume over open interest. So in this case, it'd be 317 divided by 159. And then this equals around 2, which is what this is tracking.",

Now what this can be used for is let's see, Reese says, how do you check weekly volume? I always looked at daily. I'll get to that in a second. Each says to show how much activity is happening in the period versus the total activity in a contract has traded. That's correct. So expand on that a little bit more. So it's assessing the recent activity compared to the existing proceeding activity completely correct. Now, take that one step further. How do we use that information? And then in the meantime for Reese, you essentially can either track it yourself or you have to find a data source. So a platform like think or swim, I don't think it actually is in this platform, but platforms like bar chart, unusual whales. Again, as you guys know, I'm affiliate for both of those. They do have that information. And you can also track it for yourself. O rats will also have it. So Ben says estimate, oh, I, that's not it. Good guess. Let me phrase it to you this way.

The current open interest on the number of stick men that have been purchased has been five. And then stick man starts doing marketing. They're doing a limited production run, so on and so forth. And then all of a sudden in an individual day, we see volume for stick man go to 100. So if we have 100 volume over the existing open interest of five, you can do the math here. But this tells us something very interesting is going on. It tells us that the preceding interest in stick man was five, five interest units.

We're effectively saying the reason why people might be growing interest in stick man. It is very simple. It simply means more people want this toy for either they want to bid it up and then sell it. They want to keep it as a collector's item. Whatever. Many reasons why ultimately people want an increase in stick man. You can break down that demand pretty easily.

There's abnormal interest in these options. Now you have to understand the relative component of options because in this case for this example there's obviously elevated interest in these options. But for something like spy. This really isn't much right. We're talking three hundred here, thirteen hundred here. The total dollar value of that interest quote unquote is not very high. So this isn't anything that I would think very much about. But this idea becomes much more interesting as you're trading other kinds of names that show anomalous behavior actually gave a couple examples of this recently with VIX. And it's honestly one of the reasons why I was so well positioned for these drops is because the VIX had very unusual options trading behavior leading into the drop. So that is why volume over OI is of interest to you. It's a very usable tool. Okay, so that's your quiz. Let's jump into obviously quick recap now. We talked about",

It's a very usable tool. Okay, so that's your quiz. Let's jump into obviously quick recap now. We talked about how to use the Greeks to build trades and where to find the Greeks. And the last session was about navigating the options change. So this is essentially how we visualize the Greeks for different options to come up with ideas on how we can conceivably create a trade that reflects our ideas. The other things that we discuss are how to analyze an options chain because there's a lot of data. I gave you just one example right now of volume over OI. We talked about also how to glean information from volatility from volume behavior from term structure from call put differences both in terms of volatility, but then also in terms of overall volume. We talked about how to detect if options are being bought or sold. All of these tools amplify the total amount of information you have at your disposal to make better trading decisions. And all of that is literally captured in the options chain. It's super cool, like a one stop shop for tons of information. Okay, so now recap complete.

If not, then actually a lot of this is going to be a little bit difficult to follow because I don't intend to go through these videos in crazy depth again because they're already here in videos. But there's the first one. That's the outlier strategy process. And then here's the second one, which is the outlier trade process. And again, I call it those names just because it's way I think about it. But this isn't necessarily the way to do things. This is a way to do things. But one of the most important things to keep in mind and I want to emphasize a term that you see on your screen here, repeatable. This term here is super important. Why do I emphasize the point of repeatable so much? Why am I asking you this question? If you know why I care so much about a repeatable process, throw it in the chat.

So why is repeatable so important? Why does that matter? Ben says it's hard to collect clean data when your input is random. Good, go further. That's exactly correct. Each says to make a system that's profitable rather than getting lucky and then ultimately getting right at some point. Bingo. Honestly between Ben and H, those responses in line exactly as they're written is the reason. It's because when we're trading options, we're already trading. Think of it this way.

This is about the most simplified version of the stock market that I could possibly create to even give you a glimpse of what is in here.

We'll have to use the same term twice, which is awful to do, but it's a necessary evil. But there is this exact thing where the market itself is very, very complex. It is nowhere near as simple as people tend to think it is. That's because we tend to think it's so simple because Robinhood wants to make it seem that way, right, to get you to trade because it's how they make money.

If you as a trader cannot differentiate between the output of your system, deriving from luck or path versus the actual performance of the system and you as a trader, sooner or later, it will show you. And this is the exactly funny enough, I wasn't expecting to use it for this example. But this is exactly why if you scroll through Reddit today, you are going to see a ton of these lost it all down over 8k trading options on this.

But there are nasty periods where it can go down pretty aggressively. This is the COVID drop. This is the bear market that we had in 22 where the market was down about 19.4 over the year. These aren't even really the quote unquote very ugly parts. The real ugly parts are back here in 2008, 2009. Then we have to go back way further into the 1930s before this was around. But there are plenty of periods where the market is shown really, really rough times. And this is also why a lot of traders gets really confused between how well things are working versus the reality of markets. I had somebody that was on, I was on a coaching call with just walking through their process and their approach and they were talking about how they were crushing creating zero DTE options.

And I'll show you exactly what they're doing because to no surprise, it didn't work that well for too long. So effectively what they're doing is I'm going to use the three DTE options just because the zero DTEs are going to have absolutely nothing right because it's after the close. But I want you to see the general construct. So effectively what this person was doing is saying, where do I think SPX is just overwhelmingly likely not going to go. And they would go all the way out here to what we refer to as the tails. Become all the way out here to a four delta option, a two delta option. If you take a look at the probability of a two delta option or in this case a three delta option being in the money of expiration, it is 3.2. If you take a look at the probability of a touch, it is 6.3. That is a exceedingly low probability of occurring. What was happening is that they had a massive string of winning traits as you would expect. Most of these traits worked and it's because the probability favors it. The issue was over the course of two days they gave back effectively all that they made over about six months. This is the misunderstanding of how to build a trade that's based on a sound approach.

This is the misunderstanding of how to build a trade that's based on a sound approach. So let's now talk about that. In order to even begin this process, we have to understand what we are trying to do as a trader. And in the options trading world, in my opinion, it starts with this. It starts with creating an approach. So this is the construct I give you to give you some structure around how to create your own trading approach. And again, I fully encourage you to rip this and then turn it into your own version. Do what works for you. This is what works for me. The way that I approach the markets is by first analyzing market effects. I refer to them as profit mechanisms. These market effects, profit mechanisms are the underlying method in which we attempt to make money. This sounds so simple when you break it down this way. But if I go through most of the people and just in the discord that pop on the live streams that are even just in my broader viewership, if I go through most people and I say, show me your last 10 trades and we look at those trades together, I can literally guarantee you I will find the overwhelming majority",

Why would that be? It's because we're not starting from this step. What most traders mistakenly do is they start by putting the cart so far in front of the horse, you cannot even see it. What most traders do is literally not bother with any of this, completely skip this entire stage and instead they jump straight into the second part of this broader process and specifically this step right here. If we talk to most options traders, this is literally the only thing they're doing. The only thing they're doing. My goal for you all today is to understand the importance of this step and then how once this step is built, how it simplifies this process so much. The reality for you as a trader and I can unequivocally tell you this has been my experience. The process of actually trading is mind numbingly easy. It's mind numbingly easy.

There's effectively very little thought that has to go into things and that's the process of actually clicking the buttons. It's so easy and this is the funny part when most people say, well, how much time do you actually spend trading and it's so small. Well, that too, but it's such an insignificant amount of time and the reason why is because all the work is done before you ever place trade. So when we're talking about this idea of building a trade, the entire premise is that we have to start by doing all of this work. Otherwise your trade, whatever you're doing is going to fail. That is the reality you have to accept. If you don't like that, too fucking bad. What we want, what we prefer, what would be easier for us doesn't matter in the least. What matters is what can we perform in the long run as a trader. So looking at this entire thing, I'm going to breeze through this. But first thing I want to open up a poll and I'm actually genuinely very curious in your response here. Let's take a look at spy. Actually, I'm not going to do a poll because I want to ask a few questions back to back, but there will be short answers. So you should be able to run through them really quick. Let me pop",

So the first question, if you wanted to trade spy right now, let's say you had to put on a trade and spy right now, are you going to trade it up or are you going to trade it down just literally right up or down? We're going to start with good old up or down analysis. And you'll see where I'm going to go with this in a second. Alberto says down. Let's see what else we got. Ben also says down who else who else is brave to figure out how they want to trade spy as it sits today. Haters says down, age says up, Reese says no sideways. That's correct. No sideways up or down. Those are the two choices in the scenario. Down. Okay. Next question. And I'm specifically interested in the people that answered the first question. What timeframe would you want to trade it up or down? Would you trade it for a day, five days, 10 days a month? This is in the context of whatever direction you chose to pick.

Alberto says two weeks to a month. Age says one to five. Ben says one. Hater. You answered in the last one. Were you at? Few weeks, okay. One month from Paulo, okay. Jamie, what about you? Jammigard jumping in. Down two to three months. Jamie says two weeks. Okay. So far, what do we notice? We notice that every single one of us looking at the same thing, even though there's overlapping ideas in terms of direction. A lot of people said down, still some said up. But then as soon as we add another layer of duration, there's some overlap, but there's also more different answers so far. Right? Next question. This is again, agnostic to what days to expiration you would pick. I simply want to know what kind of option would you trade? Would you buy or sell calls or puts? Don't worry about strike.

Don't worry about what expiration, just based on your idea and your timeframe. Would you buy or sell calls or puts? So there's two parts to your response by or sell calls or puts. What is it for you guys? I see buy put. I see sell calls for Reese Hader. What else for the rest of you guys? Alberto H. Pollo. Ben would buy a put. Alberto would sell puts, H would go with a long call spread. Jamie would go long some puts. OK. One more question. Now don't worry about picking a specific expiry. I want you to pick days to expiration. So whatever you selected for buying or selling, again, you don't have to pick the actual expiration. But what duration would you target for your trade buying or selling the calls or puts? Ben goes zero DTE. Reese says 50. Alberto says 45 to 60. Pollo is behind. Hader says 20 to 30 days. OK. So now if we were to create a mapping for each trader, each of these questions that I've asked, there was some overlap, right? A lot of people said down, for example. But if we were to overlap the details of each response and map them and create a counter for the frequency that we select the same thing, it would be zero. We have the direction. We have",

We have the type of timeframe. We would want to trade the idea. We have whether we would buy or sell calls or puts. We have the days to expiration we would target for those calls or puts. So far, we have already introduced a series of literally vital variables that will be the difference between making money or losing money. A great example of this that sticks out to me is Ben's trade. Ben is talking about buying puts that are zero DTE. What I can tell you is that depending on what the market does, there is a really good chance those will lose money. Now whether or not they will lose money in the long run, that depends on the strategy. So now let's go back and recenter ourselves on this idea of the outlier strategy process. And again, just a general trading process. It doesn't have to be this. It could be whatever you want. The point I'm making here is that based on all of those different ideas that we just discussed as a group for that series of people, the way that we would want to build an optimal position is completely different.

Let's use one as an example and let's start by applying the outlier strategy process at a very high level. So I'm actually going to use Ben. One because Ben has been helping us out in the discord with the question of the day prepping. And also I think Ben's trade is an interesting one. So if I go through the chat really quick and I'm just going to compile Ben's answers. So we have down. We have a one day idea. We have buying a put. And we have zero DTE for Ben. So those are the compilation to the questions I asked, direction, the duration of his idea, what the trade would be, and then the duration for the trade. So let's think about how we would build a trade around this idea. And I'm using this obviously as an example and I will show you how to apply this process.

But for a zero DTE style trade and something like this, this is going to be primarily flow and sentiment driven. Meaning short term inclusion of information is really what's going to drive markets in such a short term timeframe. Now, we already have now the profit mechanism defined. Now we need to think about some signals that help us identify this profit mechanism. So if we were to just spitball some ideas with respect to signals that are going to be relevant here, there are things like a VWOP. There are things like volume, support and resistance. Again, this is all for a very short term timeframe. We need to figure out a couple of questions. We need to know what the robustness is of this zero DTE directional idea. So we need to do a robustness check and I'll show you some different ways you can go about this. We also need to qualify and quantify the effect. So something we can use for this super simple.

I call it the eyeball test because it takes exactly very little effort. And it's to help me just like just look literally just look and see what kind of sticks out to you. And a couple things really stick out to me right from the jump. The first thing is in a longer term timeframe, it's definitely uptrending. As I look at the distribution of candles between green and red update versus down day, I can see that it's sporadic and then also streaky. So that's an idea that I might want to explore. Meaning, is there some sort of concept or probability I can attempt to trade? If the underlying is up two days in a row. So one of the things I would do is start writing these ideas down. Ideas. So the first thing can be next day persistence. Based on prior day, friend. And then I would just slowly explore this idea.

Another key part of this process is if we're thinking about buying puts, we know we're in a race against time. And we also know that depending on what kind of price movement we want, the type of put we would buy looks different. So to illustrate this point, let's zoom into six month daily. And I'm going to go back in time. I'm going to take us to the third of March. And I want to look at an example with you. I think they should let us go to March three. Yeah, perfect. And we'll go towards the beginning of the day. We'll start at a zero seven forty five. We'll see what the kennel looks like there. Yeah, this looks okay. I'm just going to give you an example. Now, we already know this is a down day. I'm giving you we already know the direction. So now Ben, this is a specific question for you. What? What zero DTE put trade? Am I doing? And I just also want to let Ben off the hook in the sense that Ben never said that this is what he would do. Ben is literally just answering the binary questions effectively. I gave him. So I don't want the perception of like this is Ben's idea and we're debunking it or",

You don't have to worry about what the graph looks like. I just want to track the numbers so that we don't forget them. So there's that one. Now let's take a look at a couple other ideas. Let's say maybe we grab something that's like 50 delta and I accidentally bought it. I meant to or accidentally sold this one. I got to buy this one. And I'm not worrying about cost yet. I'm literally just putting on single lots because I just want to compare relative movements. And then let's say that we want to get something that's super far in the money so that we're paying very little extrinsic values. So maybe something like this, the 60 20s. And then let's say following Ben's idea, we want to go, I think he did it to delta. So maybe we'll go out of the money but we'll pick something that's a more common tail trade, which is like a five delta. So what I did is I literally have just grabbed a handful. And the, that line is very good. And the goal here is I just want to help us come up with an understanding of the movements. Now let's go towards the end of the day. The market will close.

And rather than writing all of this out in my terrible handwriting, I will grab an Excel sheet so that we can explore the idea together. Now let's get rid of all this stuff. Okay, and then I need to get my little tablet out the way. So, let's start here. So we have what's the easiest way to differentiate here? We're all the same DTEs, so I'm not going to bother inputting this. I'm just going to put, strike, delta, and then premium. And then we will look at exits, premium. And then over here we'll calculate cost. Then we'll calculate, you know, and then we'll calculate relic. This is freezing up to how do we? There we go. The game of these windows freezing is really annoying because in order to unfreeze that I literally have to click in random windows, sometimes it's OBS, sometimes it's the other browser window.

We're just eyeballing and testing some very basic ideas to see what might work. Okay, so right now in the example, SP500 is at 582163. Nope, it's still uploading. Come on, man, you could do it.

And then we have 6250. So we have all of this. So if we think about different size price moves, the total impact of the position will be completely different depending on how far the stock moves. Now we'll start by just using delta. There will be other factors like implied volatility. But again, like because this is completely locked up, it's not really going to help us. And actually to see if I can't fix it, what I'll do is I'll move us over to this screen. I'm just going to close it down really fast if I can't open it back up. Yes, completely frozen. Very, very weird. Okay. So if we just use delta, it'll be close. It won't be as accurate as I want. So I'm trying to open thinkorswim again right now. It says it's installing updates. So I'll give it a second to do that. And then if not, I'll just start guessing. So we know that this would have been about the stock price though, the 5950. And then because that's like a 50 delta.

And then it closed at 5849. And it looks like thinkorswim is down because it's stuck on installing update. So just keep over here. So this line is this. The bud by this. So this was our move on the day, 1.99. So then we can just eyeball. 5849 is the exit. And then we can again, we can guess what the premium might be based on just the changes in delta. So we'll simulate that now again. I just want to be abundantly clear. There are other factors we're just using what we can right now because thinkorswim is down. So the stock price here, then we'll do delta impact. And this isn't going to capture gamma unfortunately. So the delta's we're going to speculate that they move linearly, but they won't.

Well, we'll see if thinkorswim turns on later if you guys can keep me a prize if you don't mind trying it once in a while. And then in the meantime, I'll just summarize what we effectively know will happen. The first thing we know what will happen is that these two trades need much bigger moves in order to make money. But if we get those big moves because of gamma, they will compound very quickly. So then if we were to size these trades on a commensurate basis with the largest trade, which in this case is 62.5. What we can do is we can just eyeball what the lot sizes would be. So in this case, we're saying 62.5 is the cap. That's the most we can put on. So this is going to be a one lot. And then this equals the 62.5 divided by this. So this one you can get on a four lot. This one would equal the 62.5 divided by this. You can get a 54 lot. And then this one equals the 62.5",

Because here's effectively what would happen. In this scenario, we can see that for the more expensive position, you can't put on as many. But the bigger position will have a much higher delta. So then if you don't get as big of a move as you thought you might get, then all of a sudden, this one delta can make a lot of sense. So now let's go back. I'm going to just put on think or swim. And then let's go back. I'm going to grab what's trading view. We can use this for the example. And we were looking at SPX. And I don't have like the convenient indicators on like the same labels.

One of the things I notice for sure is that when it's going down, the candles are bigger. And then I notice when it's going up, the candles are smaller, not every time, but in general. So the reason why this matters is because the way that I might build my trade, if I think it's going up versus if I think it's going down on the day, might also depend on where we are in a cycle. So in this case, I'm expecting smaller movements. If I'm trying to trade a zero DTE idea, using those super far out of the money options is going to be very suboptimal because you're not going to get enough of a move in order for them to show a profit at the rate that they're decaying away. Whereas if I'm trying to trade the zero DTE idea on one of these more inside days, maybe I go with the higher cost, higher delta. And it's because I get at least the dollar for dollar move with the underlying. So then, conversely, if I'm trading up or down direction, but during these broader down move style days, the way that I build",

That information impacts how I ultimately will build the trade. So now that we have at least a base understanding of how we test different structures to then create parameters around, this is when we turn option structures into strategies, then we can get into the trade process. And the process of building a trade is now very simple, because using this example that we just did, if I know that I'm trading zero DTE options with the directional tilt, and if I run my data analysis based on downloading historic data, and I take a look at what's the propensity for the third trading day after the prior two days were read, maybe the same thing if the prior two days were green. And then I know that when the market is going down, the average true range is higher as compared to when it's going up. So in this example, going back to this, if we were trading one of these days in here, would I prefer, let's say we were trading it to the downside again, if I",

So in this example, going back to this, if we were trading one of these days in here, would I prefer, let's say we were trading it to the downside again, if I were trading this to the downside, would I prefer in the money based position or in out of the money based position? I might prefer something that allows me to compound more, or for me, I would actually take a hybrid, fortunately, because it's not really a this or that, meaning the base position might be something that's in the money for the delta move, but then the, I might add a kicker options that are out of the money that will compound quickly if the move is large enough. I wouldn't do that if I was trying to trade directly on one of these days. Now this is also with the glory of hindsight, right? Seeing exactly what happens, but you'll notice as you analyze these things that this trend is very common, whereas things are going up and maintaining up trends, the average daily range will contract, volatility will contract.

By understanding what the implications are, where we are today in the market against what my idea is, and then I build the trade that capitalizes on that idea. And again, this example was using a zero DTE concept. And again, to Ben's point earlier, doesn't mean that's not Ben's strategy. He was just responding to questions I had. Now, when we're going through and building a trade, one other note that's extremely important to identify. And again, this is all from the Outlier Trade Process video. You'll get all these details there. But the main thing is that it always, every single time, starts with reviewing the portfolio. The reason why we have to review the portfolios because we need to know what the portfolio needs or doesn't need, what we want to put in or what we don't want.

And in that case, you might choose to be super selective on what you might in exposure to. So that's why portfolio fit is literally always first. So unfortunately, the platform is down. So I am going to wrap up this session here. I'm happy to hang out for a little bit. We can do like a Q and A if you guys want to talk about what we just reviewed together. If there's specific elements that you want to explore, happy to discuss that stuff. Sorry that the platform kind of crept out on us a little bit of a bummer. But that's how it goes. The main thing is you really don't need the platform to understand the broader concepts that I'm explaining to you, at least hopefully. And the broad takeaway here is that when you're building a trade, needs to start from the point of executing a strategy. The strategy has to be something that we've researched.

What I want to show you is how to explore that idea that I was just outlining, specifically the, well, what's the propensity if there's two consecutive down days that the third day is up or down, right? Like that kind of thing. Now, normally I would use something very simple. Like I would just use Python, but everybody now has access to ChatGPT, which is actually awesome because ChatGPT can accelerate all of that. So what I'm going to do now is go into SPX really fast on bar chart. And I'm going to go to historical data. So right now, I am here. And then I can just download it for the past, you know, experience of time. And as you can tell, we download a lot. So we'll grab this, open this up. First step, we just got to clean it super fast, get rid of this. And then the other thing that you'll learn from bar chart is that bar chart really, or I'm sorry, not bar chart.

I want to see if there is a predictive trend. When there are two consecutive days of either an up or down move. And I'm going to define for it what I consider the upper down move. So this is going to be using open to close. I want to see if there's a predictive trend when there are two consecutive down days of either upper down for the next trading day and the propensity for it to either continue the trend or reverse it.

Okay, so let's see. Brian says, are you a full-time trader? I definitely, depending on what you consider full-time, but I make the most money from trading. But I do a lot of other things. Ben says, oh, I thought I chose the puts specific for compounding, but I've never actually done anything with options. Yeah, no, that's okay. And that's the those puts that you got the way to look at it is that they're not all created equal. There are some puts that are much more susceptible to compounding. And then there are other other puts that really don't compound as much, but just provide standard leverage. So a good example of that is if you buy an option that has a delta of one, it doesn't compound at all. It's already out of one delta. The compounding effective options occurs from gamma. So if I show you, I mean, get rid of all that nonsense. I show you an option that has let's call it a 0.10 delta. And then let's say gamma is 0.01. And then let's",

I show you an option that has let's call it a 0.10 delta. And then let's say gamma is 0.01. And then let's just fill this out like loosely. It's say like 0.20. Let's say gamma is 0.02. Let's say 0.30. Gamma is 0.02. 0.40. And I think these are behind my head. So I'll move myself in a second. Let's say gamma goes to 0.03. And then so on. Give me one sec. I'll just move myself off to there. So this is one scenario compared to the other scenario where we have a delta of one. Gamma will be 2,000. At least in your positive direction, just to be clear, like technically this will, this still absolutely can have gamma because delta in this context can change if it goes against you. But I'm just saying for the continuation, you can't gain any more delta. It's maxed out. So here's what happens. The stock goes up 1 plus 1. You now have, you go from 10 delta, you gain 10 cents of premium, you gain 1 delta. So now you have 0.11. And then this continues down the path. So then another scenario, if you have, let's say the underlying goes up another dollar, just pretending maybe this is super liquid and this represents a 1 move. So now, well, there",

So now, well, there would be like 0.15 or something. So what ends up happening is as your option, as it moves in your favor, it compounds more quickly than just what the delta would provide. And it's because it's rapidly gaining more delta as it goes in your favor. Whereas if you have an option with the delta of one and it continues to go in your favor, the most you can have is one. So the compounding effect is all from gamma. Gamma is what allows your option to gain more delta's and the gaining of more delta's per same one point move is what leads to the like the actual compounding effect. Whereas if we get something with the delta of one, there really isn't much of a compounding effect because it's already at the biggest size, more or less that it can be. But you have leverage still because that leverage comes from the fact that even though that you have a delta of one and you can't gain more delta's, it absolutely is still cheaper to buy an option with a delta of one to control those 100 shares as compared to buying 100 shares outright.

So two different ways to play the same idea. Paul says generally speaking does increased volume and our OI correspond to levels observed in price action. Generally speaking depends on how generally speaking. If I were to do my best to give you an answer that isn't it depends, I would say a low correlation, but it depends. And it's because there are certain things that there will be a significant correlation. And then there will be other things where there's very little correlation. So it genuinely does depend quite a lot. Now let's see what ChatGPT came back with. The file and data processing was interrupted. Please upload the file again. Okay. You're saying. I'm using, I don't know if you guys have tried GTPT 4.5. It seems okay, but I think for this 4.0 will be better. So I'm letting that run in the background.

Time column is now date and last column is now closed. That's so funny. In this chat thread that I have with it, I trained it to the old columns and it remembered it.

And this goes back to the original idea that we were talking about for Ben for trading, zero DTE directionally. And we have to figure out some sort of predictive capacity to identify direction. So we downloaded the last 25 years of data for SPX daily. We asked it to run the analysis on the last five years. And again, I would take this research much further. I would segmented, I would wait it towards the more recent data. I would use a longer look back window, but it's really just for the sake of the example here. And this is what chatGPT gave us. It gives us the actual output of data. And it says that in the scenarios, the probability of a trend continuation after two consecutive updates, 51 chance the next day is up 48 that it's down. The probability of a trend continuation after two consecutive down days, 55 reversal, 44 continuation. So what do we notice? We notice two very usable ideas. The first idea is that there is a slight edge for reversal in both scenarios. The second thing we identify is that the probability of a reversal is larger on down days than updates to consecutive down days turning into up. That's a four point edge that's pretty significant.

That's a four point edge that's pretty significant. Now there are further questions we could ask to refine this. You can see that the correlation between the 20-day average daily range and third consecutive continuation is about null. It's insignificant. So then we can ask other questions, though. We can say, is there a relationship between the five-day ADR and maybe the 20-day compared to the five-day ADR? Or maybe the price direction for the first 15 minutes of the day compared to the close? Or the size of the prior move as individual days or composite days? These all these different questions are ways that then we can analyze and this all is tied to step number two. But all of this then continues to help inform our ideas. So a follow-on question I would ask and let's see what it has is for each scenario what is the average percent move on the third day? So now I'm essentially saying and wanting to see is is there a meaningful difference between the size of the move in these two scenarios? So after two days the average after two up days the average third day move is negative 0.016. So on an average besides the count it means that the down moves on the third day are larger than the up moves right that's",

    "text": "of the move in these two scenarios? So after two days the average after two up days the average third day move is negative 0.016. So on an average besides the count it means that the down moves on the third day are larger than the up moves right that's how it builds that negative skew. And then after two down days there's a positive 0.078 average move to the upside. So what that would infer then is that there's absolutely a more significant effect to the rebound versus a third continuation down day. All tradable information. This is the fun part of trading to me. I don't know if this is stuff that you guys are like yeah this sucks. But for me this is like the the ability to just explore ideas like this and then to figure out how to monetize them is so fun. That's one of the big things I'm actually about to work on a video right now that's talking about a recent change that I've seen in zero DTE option and I'm excited to launch that it won't be out honestly for like a month because I'm building out the videos I'm traveling a bit hitting up Ireland next month. So I like to try to have videos queued up for you guys so that you're still busy. But Ben says do we see that in option press. All's going up on two days down. I don't follow. Could you help me understand",

    "text": "a bit hitting up Ireland next month. So I like to try to have videos queued up for you guys so that you're still busy. But Ben says do we see that in option press. All's going up on two days down. I don't follow. Could you help me understand better. Premium. Well think of it this way right. You would have to break that out then into two follow on questions. The first primary input in this context is going to be volatility. So is there a demonstrable volatility edge or I'm sorry delta change. And in this case we know that if volatility if the market's going down two days in a row volatility is more likely to be expanding than contracting especially when compared to two consecutive opt days volatility will typically contract versus expand. So that will input or impact the price correspondingly. And then the severity of the move would be the second input in terms of option premiums. So what you'll notice at a high level and again that that's a great question by the way. But the way that you would chase that down subsequently is then creating like a 20 day and a 10 day rolling volatility input for the model which is again super easy to do. Chat you can do it for you or you can do it in Python and you can analyze if volatility is expanding because if it is then you know the options are getting more",
