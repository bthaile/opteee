    "text": "hey everyone eric here with a very quick small stacks portfolio update i established a position in pfizer that i think is pretty well positioned i do think that it's going to be a little tough to manage in the small stacks portfolio i actually have it replicated in my margin account at a you know larger scale that i intend to manage a little differently and more actively but nonetheless i do like pfizer here and i like them as a long-term product so that's why i entered into a call diagonal so let's take a look at pfizer first and kind of where they're at and then we'll jump over to the portfolio so in general pfizer for the last two years has been coming down if we zoom out to the last five years it's still uptrending and we see them between the mid and -1 standard deviation channel which you know all sounds kind of par for the course and then i see them approaching the minus one standard deviation channel here now one of the reasons why i'm willing to get long here is i absolutely expect there to be a little bit more downside but if you take a look at it it's really not that large of a dollar value so we're gonna you know look at essentially 36 down to 33 to get to the minus 2 standard deviation and moreover than that as soon as i can exit my xle position",
