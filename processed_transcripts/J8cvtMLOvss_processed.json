    "text": "Next, question of the day from Twitter up here, do you know the answer? As you can tell by the way it's written now, it's by design. There is no best strike for an option straight. It's completely relative to what you're trying to do as a trader. And the way to think about options is there's strategic investments. They're complex. You actually sacrifice a lot when you trade options because not only do you have to be correct, but now you're time bound, you have to be correct within an amount of time. Not only do you have to worry about the Delta movement of a product, but now you have to worry about volatility. So one of the benefits of adding that complexity is to be able to get really specific with what you're trying to do. So my thought on trading options and what's worked for me is not trying to apply these broad platitudes that essentially take away one of the primary benefits of trading options, which is being able to get specific. So think about what you're trying to do with your options position and then structure a trade around it. Don't worry about what strike is best. There isn't one. There's the other.",
