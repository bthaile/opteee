    "text": "Welcome to this video on options trading. Today we're going to talk about gamma in options trading. Gamma measures the rate of change in delta for a given change in the underlying asset. For at-the-money options, gamma is at its highest. As the option moves further in-the-money or out-of-the-money, gamma decreases. Gamma is also affected by time to expiration. As expiration approaches, gamma increases for at-the-money options. This is why options close to expiration can see dramatic price swings. Traders need to be aware of gamma risk when managing options positions. Thanks for watching! Don't forget to subscribe for more options trading content.",
