Slight level of discomfort, fine, but it shouldn't be that significant. So, um, Reese says, that's why I said discord things. Yeah, that's my bad. I totally realized that I had it as unlisted. I, the reason why is because I reuse old ones. So, sometimes it'll adopt weird settings, but let's get back over to the flexible grid quick. So, we already talked about the net highs lows and the lower breadth that we're seeing going through this general up move. Now, I want to talk about where we're seeing strength and weakness. And what do you, what sticks out to you about this series of million charts? What's, there should be something like directly drawing your eyeballs. The market has had one of its best one week periods, not like full trading week one day to Friday, but five days in quite a while. And there's something that immediately draws my eye. Take a look at the different sectors. Do we see anything materials? No. Dark Mark is on the right track. Dark Mark says they look very similar movement, most of them do.

Dark Mark says they look very similar movement, most of them do. But there are a couple that's not. And specifically one that sticks out like an absolute sore thumb. The reason why you have to train your eyes to look for these kinds of relationships is because underneath the surface of this is exactly where opportunity lives, literally exactly where opportunity lives. So, Reese says VIX, it's not VIX. I would look at VIX different than everything else already because it's a volatility exchange traded product, ATP. So, not VIX, what do you notice about this one right here? It's kind of like where's Waldo because there's so many graphs. Lauren says XLV, that's exactly correct, literally 100 correct. Literally, everything else is at least marginally participating in the upside here. Literally everything, except XLV. XLV has been getting beaten down like a dog and it's not slowing down. It had one minor reprieve on the 12th and that was about it. So, if we go to XLV just to look first at the sector level, this is what it looks like over the last six months. This thing is getting crushed. Then if you take a look at what might not be helping, you and H. So, UNH is literally down another 20, 30 points after hours. UNH is getting,",

Now, we talked about this on Sunday and I literally told you guys that immediately following that conversation on Sunday, I put a position on to trade it to the downside. I went with long puts and short calls so I made synthetic shorts and it's honestly just because I didn't have a sense of severity. There's no part of my body that expected this gap or this continuation or the next gap that we're seeing. That's not why the trade went on and there's no way that I would take any credit for that movement. I didn't expect that severity. I expected the direction but if I expected this full severity, I would have gone long out of the money puts at scale. That's exactly how I would have played this had I known the future, but I didn't. So, that's why I went with synthetic shorts because it gives you a little bit of both worlds. You can finance some of the long puts from the short calls.

You can finance some of the long puts from the short calls. The problem with stuff like this is the vol is all on the put side. So, you actually have to size up on the call side quite a bit in order to get something close to what you might want to finance the long puts. So, not fully optimal, but you make it work. That's the whole idea here. But, identifying opportunities like this is huge and it's not just you and H, by the way. It's again, if we go back into XLV as the sector, we've seen this for a while where it's under performing literally the rest of the sectors. So, when you see something doing that, it should always draw your attention even from a very loose perspective. And when I say loose perspective, I mean, even from like, hey, this sticks out to me. So, if we take a look at the sectors and then we go into healthcare, let's take a look at the five day change. On the five day change, I don't know how many names are in this in total. Then, anybody know off the top of your head? I don't remember. So, face it to say, what I was going to give you is like the number that are up",

And that's absolutely a minority because I have to scroll twice, essentially, to get to the rest of this list. So, this gives you good pot odds from finding things to trade to the short side. And the other thing to pay attention to as you're analyzing stuff like this is take a look at PODD. If we look into PODD, PODD just had a baller earnings release. Absolutely crushed it. Notice how EPS actually underperformed, but they had a good overall earnings release. Why am I showing you this? I'm showing you this because this gives you another great exercise to always add to your market analysis toolkit.

I still personally wouldn't to be completely honest with you. It was just not worth it. There's other opportunities out there. Is that a bad trade? I don't think it's terrible. But there's other stuff out there that's more appealing to me right now. However, you had better believe that this gets added to a watch list because we know PODD is doing really well when the majority of the sector is absolutely sucking wind. That's a good thing to keep in your back pocket because what do you think sometimes, not always, but sometimes if in the near term, if the timing lines up and healthcare for whatever reason starts seeing appreciation, a lot of times you'll see some of that bleed into the top performers. Now, you can apply a wrote system though and say, okay, I'm going to go long PODD once healthcare goes up because there's a momentum factor and there's a really high chance for reversion in momentum, depending on what time frames you're analyzing. You have to be aware of this because otherwise, you could very easily be setting yourself to be put in front",

So that's something to pay attention to here. Now, with momentum factor, something to keep in mind is typically speaking, there's a couple key time frames that matter a lot. So like one month, three months, six month, 12 months, those were like really common periods to analyze. Six months, 12 months tend to have higher continuation. This is largely for growth stocks. One month, three months often have reversion. So not always, it's again, it's a statistical measure. There will be plenty that don't, but it's something to keep in the back of your mind as you look at it because seeing this kind of really good move over the course of one month, right, where a good majority of this move comes over the last month. Well, you kind of have to pay attention to that. Now, this does not get overwhelmed by post earnings announcement drift, however. If you have a really strong catalyst like post earnings announcement drift, that can overwhelm a lot of momentum reversion tendencies. Welcome to momentum, a lot of different factors.

So it's nothing to overweight, but that is a great paper, nonetheless. You just always have to again, pay attention to what you're reading, the pros and cons. This is also a really great paper. And this one is useful for shorter term effects. I'll drop these really quick in the discord so that you have access to them if you're interested in them.

So Moody Blu says, can you take a look at AMD? It seemed to have broken down, broken its downtrend. However, it's sold down this morning. Yeah, let's take a look.

But without some sort of value element to it, I don't like it here. And yeah, that's so tough because I feel like the reason I'm still conflicted here is because I feel like AMD is in such a great position to partake in such a significant amount of the broader AI adoption for a list of different reasons. AMD is not participating well at all. So it creates a natural conflict in the way that I look at it because I do think that there is genuine opportunity here. And if you get into these things at lower levels, you reduce your overall risk. But it's still so early in this broader move that it would be hard for me to like really like it unless there's a value element. If there's not a value element and this becomes a speculative upside play, it's like a 50 50 chance. I know that doesn't mean much, but it really like this move here is strong.

But again, if you're anywhere, not even top-ticking it, if you're anywhere up here, what I'm hovering on is the point of control, which is where the majority of people transacted over the last year, those people are down 52 in total. I mean, they're just they're not even close, right? Because remember the way that percentages work. When you're down 52, you need a significantly larger upside move in order to get back to break even. I have a table here that shows it to you on my website specifically for this reason, because it's useful here. So if you take a look, 52 down move, you need 1008 in 604. You need in the reason why I'm adding 106 is you have to account for a little bit of the volatility component to it. But in a gross move, you need essentially double and change in order to get back. And it's not even halfway there yet. Well, I guess it is just halfway there. I should say give it some credit. So that's why the value element in my mind is so important.

Let me know it's time for him to come in. So let's see. I want to actually look more so at its earnings. I also don't know why they would use the trailing 12 month for the PE ratio. I care so much more about a forward PE. Yeah, I mean, like what does this like does this shock you? I don't really care so much about HPE and C gate like you can call them close to whatever.

What I'm doing is I'm throwing it up in another comparison tool real quick here. The reason why I like this one is because it breaks down a couple things a little more in depth that I like to take a look at. So this is these here are really useful. So revenue growth is good. Yes, he like this is better. This is way better. And this is why like forward PE so much more than trailing 12 months because on a forward PE basis, this actually looks good. Trailing 12 months, I don't love it there, but price to sales is soft, but not too soft. I mean, it's way cheaper on a relative basis than in video, which I would have to expect.

That's interesting. Bit to offer. Let's take a look on a weighted basis. Oh, don't love that. Super short. Am. Wow. So this is either a pretty healthy bit of profit taking that you see. And that's incredible. The reason why I'm stuck on this is take a look at it on a relative basis. If we look over the last 30 days, I mean, you've not seen downside premium this heavy. So that's that's nuts. So a bunch of volume in the out of the money, super short term, that's par for the course. We look at open interest, which I'm more interested in. That's so funny.

There's a lot of other stuff that I think looks really good. But it does have wind at its back at how to good earnings. It just has a really, really long history of a down move to work through, right? Like this is just so much overhead resistance that companies that get bogged down like this, they have to get through so much shit before they can really start to rally. And this is why I like smaller growth names for directional trading a lot because a lot of them don't have the scars like this that they're going to have to overcome. If you look at something like Reddit, this is another great example of something that came out of the gate super hot. And it's starting to show more strength.

Some of these people maybe they're happy to get out at break even or whatever the case is. So when you have this near term overhead, it always just serves as a natural suppressor to price. And you can always go through it. It's possible, but you need a strong enough catalyst. The longer the overhead is there and the deeper it is, the more you need to overcome it. So then the question to me always is not, is there a trade here? The outlier way to think about it is, is this the right place for my money? And that's why for me, AMD wouldn't be right now.

Braamus says, what are the purpose of the convertible notes? GME issued. The purpose of those notes is a slick way to be able to accumulate some capital to purchase Bitcoin without having to burn a bunch of their money. So that's really the purpose. And it's a way to do it without near-term dilution. There is a potential dilution in the future, depending on how they choose to resolve them. But in the near term, there isn't. So then you can overwhelm the cost. Let's say if you get into Bitcoin and Bitcoin does really well while you're in that kind of stuff. So it gives them some choices, I would say.

So earnings is on the 21st. Even split. Yeah, pretty even split. Pulse to puts. And let's take a look in the cycle itself. Which this is the cycle that's going to hold. So it looks like a pretty big long premium. That split both ways. So not really a clear directional trend from the options markets and the way that they've built out together also tells me that there's not like some sort of really strong near-term speculation that is starting to pipe up. They've literally been growing effectively in unison with one another. So I find that generally interesting. Now let's take a look at the actual exploration. I want to look at it by premium. And we need this exploration here. So it looks like you have a bit more on the put side. 229K at the 95s. So that's a fair downside expectation style positioning for earnings.

Because what's going to happen over the next couple days in target, you'll find that the front exploration is going to be pretty jacked in terms of volume. And that'll be people moving out a little further in time. So this is people playing this near-term move. And then they'll probably start positioning how they want for earnings. So it'll be the next couple days in my opinion that'll be a little more informative with how the market is looking to position. But if I were trading this, it would only be from an earnings lens. And we can see how it typically likes to behave around earnings here. Which is a little bit haywire. And yeah, I mean, it's literally all over the place. So if we look over the last 12 quarters, six of them have been outside. So this almost becomes more for like a long premium style strategy. But that's not really my go-to for earnings. So I wouldn't touch it for earnings either. Broader sector is not looking good to me.

So yeah, the way that I look at stuff like this is unless you have a direct opinion related to earnings, this is just something I would wait until post earnings, right? And see how it resolves. If you have some sort of directional speculation or a vol speculation for earnings, then it's a little too early to put those trades on in my opinion. So I see a few ways to play. You can try to play the near-term downside continuation, expecting vol to continue to slowly climb. That's one way to go about it. And you can see that generally reflected here, right? Where 30 day term vol is sliding up and then you can interpolate that out to near-term vol and, probably expect a similar near-term trend of climbing into the release. So yeah, that's how I would generally look at it. Near-term downside, probably expecting vol expansion or just waiting to earnings. I think waiting to earnings is probably the way that I would go.

And if you ever needed a reminder of that, you can always look at average true-range, average-day ranges for pretty much any reference period realistically. So because of that, I tend to like trading Tesla more from a vol perspective. Now, if somebody has a directional opinion in Tesla, I feel like the one of the only suitable ways I could even conceive of trying to trade that is with a longer-term play in mind, just because of how how it moves is a way to consider. Ricky says, Tesla looks very due for a decent-sized pullback. You can't look at markets that way. There's just not how it works. If you take a look at Tesla on a longer-term time frame, you could argue during this big up move, it was due for a pullback much earlier. And the reason for this actually is not even a whole lot from the stock. It's from a mix of stock and perception of things. So with that in mind, I think trying to play things like that with the quote-unquote like due for a pullback, unless you can quantify it in some sort of way and you're trying to play some sort of mean reversion than yes. So like, for example, what I can tell you is over different periods, Tesla has displayed a pretty high tendency based on",

So like, for example, what I can tell you is over different periods, Tesla has displayed a pretty high tendency based on a Hurst exponent for price mean reversion. And then what I can do is actually quantify the price that it tends to mean reverse two relative to current price. So right now, it's a pretty fair Hurst exponent for reversion back to like 279. So that doesn't mean that it will do that, but it means that there is absolutely a tendency for that kind of two-sided movement. So one of the ways that I would play something like that if I was expecting some sort of pullback is I would literally just set a couple alerts. And then if it starts breaking down through this recent move, then I mean pretty much anything below here, right? Once it starts falling meaningfully below like the 316, 317 handle then it starts to look like pretty likely to move down into the point of control, at least somewhat. But right now, if it starts plowing through this volume node, then it's a pretty clear sign to me that it's bid and people want to speculate upside. So that's how I would play something like that.

So I don't go out that far in time. It's not like more of a positional style play. It's like a very, very short-term idea. So for those you would probably find me in like 30 day or 60 day options, I typically prefer the 60 days in this kind of thing, but the 30 day might be fine. I'd have to take a look and see what theta looks like comparatively. Let's see. These are at 33 cents. These are at 25 cents. I don't think these would have no gamma though. Yeah, the gamma is like super light. So if I was expecting a near-term move, I would probably do like the 37 and plan to hold it for like five days. But if you don't, if like I didn't get the move fast enough, yeah, time to, time to bounce. So and it's just because theta would be coming in way too hot and heavy in that instance.

And I really do tend to find that as a pretty big mistake. Like if somebody were to say like Eric, well, how would you find a trade right now? I would literally follow the scanning process that I've shared with you guys a million times, right? I would start with building context on the broad economy and stock market. We have that. Then I would look at the portfolio and I would say, what is the portfolio need? Do I need long beta-weighted delta, short beta-weighted delta? Does it not matter? Do I need long premium, short premium? Does it not matter? And if there's no inputs from any of those, then it's just looking for opportunities. And if I'm looking for opportunities, it's literally looking for stuff like this. That's just a way better return on the risk from a probabilistic lens than trading, trying to trade something that's mid-range. Mid-range things can be really, really challenging. But again, that's because I don't really have a longer term preference, right? I will trade whatever it is as it presents itself. So, yeah, I think something like Tesla doesn't look terrible, but like I said in the beginning, I would much prefer to trade this from a vol perspective than pretty much anything else. And",

And you can see if you traded it from a vol perspective recently here, I mean, you would have got smashed. Again, depending on what term you're playing, but still, like, something like Tesla in the near term still can have like really rough vol periods in terms of realized versus expected. Let's take a look at vol. Yeah, I mean, you can see it reflected pretty cleanly here. And it's been running a negative risk reversal skew, which again, it doesn't surprise me whatsoever because of how volatile it's been recently. So, it's just been absolutely outperforming implied, which again, that's what happens when you trade stuff. That's like this. Silency persists at what point does UNH look like a good entry for a bounce? Mine is 300, but we'll see again, I wouldn't bother. That's not how I would trade UNH. The way that I would look at UNH is it's in a defined downtrend until it starts to consolidate until it starts to rally, but it needs to consolidate. It needs to actually like display the behavior that you need to see. So again, I don't look at these things and say like it's absolutely crashing. When do",

And it's because at some point it will likely go up, but while I'm sitting here trying to find that point in this, there are things that are already going up heavily following a really great earnings release. And I much prefer to trade that. Again, the question I would always tell you to think of before you place a trade is not, could there be a trade here that answer or the question always is, is this the right place for my money? Like, is this the right trade? And I am always looking for easier opportunities more than anything. I'm not looking to trade stuff that is wishy-washy. I much prefer again, stuff like this, like very, very clear defined trends that I can try to capitalize on or break out. Again, I'll show you a really simple scan that I use pretty regularly. If we go to screener, let's just look for an earnings move. Let's say that we're looking for short deltas. We'll tighten this up to like the last three days. So it's a little more relevant.

So this, the way that I would look to trade this is if there is essentially a continuation below where it's at now. And as a betting man, which is what I am, I do think that seems likely to occur. I don't know for sure. The market seems to like the call side of the equation. But again, if you take a look, most of it is short calls. So from an OI perspective, you can be misled. And you could say, well, there's 9,000 calls against 2,000 puts. But what I can tell you from the recent activity today is that there's a lot of short calls going out. So this is probably yet not super liquid. I mean, it's fine if you have a small account and you're only trading a few lots. But this is like I would much prefer monitor this. Well, let's see. These are kind of tough with like these really just big parabolic drops. This, I mean, it's super cheap, but really high-vol. So this kind of thing I would trade just short premium.

But these are more so the types of like downside, directional ideas that I would want to tinker with. For upside, there's tons that have had a really good earnings. There's literally tons and tons and tons of names. I got 213 returns in the scan for upside is compared to downside. So the market is absolutely showing a little bit of upside strength here. I think for sure. Anything else you guys want to talk about? I want to poke through maybe like a poster too from Reddit. I like doing those towards the end of the stream just so that we can see what's happening. We'll take a look in options. Let's see what's going on here. And let's do. And let's do. Yeah, this is good. All right. Let's see what's happening in the world of Reddit. Options trading strategy sharing. Okay. Let's take a look at this one. This says thinking of getting into some long term 2027 at the money options. I only have experience with six month out X-preies. I don't even know what that means. What are your general recommendations for managing gains or losses? I usually wait to lock in when delta is closer to 08.",

Already have a 30 to 50 gain should I just be making the play with 12 months and then. So this I like because they're asking the question, but like this is a. This is a really ignorant perspective to carry on trading options because so like this right when we're talking about. If you're getting into longer dated options and the first question is you have to ask yourself why? Why am I getting into this option? Does this make sense to me if you're going into these longer dated options. It's literally just because you want to hold something with leverage for a longer duration. Like that's the point that you would go out to 2027 that that's okay if you are. But then that should inform the way that you're managing gains or losses. It shouldn't be based on delta. If like who cares if delta moves delta will move for different reasons. I think what matters way more is what's your price expectation for the underlying and does it do that. So and then it says should I be making the play within 12 months so like this again it just is kind of. I don't",

It looks like the cliff notes version for what I see here is like what I very regularly see which is somebody that doesn't understand options and they're trying to piece together in approach which is fine but they don't understand options. And if you understand options you start to answer most of these questions for you because they're asking the wrong ones like worrying about what expiration if they're going to go to 2027 or 12 months or whatever. Like none of that really matters yet until you have the broader plan built which is what do you expect the underlying to do and why are you using options in the first place based on that. That's how I would build a management approach. This is super common. They're not doing anything that all of us haven't done before. But this is just kind of like cobbling it together as you're as you're going which typically doesn't work super great with options. Especially this style. So yeah interesting one to take a peek at.
