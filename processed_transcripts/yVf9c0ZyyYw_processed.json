Now, I want to talk about where we're seeing strength and weakness and what do you, what sticks out to you about this series of million charts. What's there should be something like. Directly drawing your eyeballs. The market has had one of its best one week periods, not like full trading week one day to Friday, but five days in quite a while. And there's something that immediately draws my eye. Take a look at the different sectors. Do we see anything in materials? No, dark mark is on the right track.

The reason why you have to train your eyes to look for these kinds of relationships is because underneath the surface of this is exactly where opportunity lives literally exactly where opportunity lives. So re says VIX. It's not VIX. I would look at VIX different than everything else already because it's a volatility exchange traded product. VTP. So not VIX. What do you notice about this one right here? It's kind of like where's Waldo because there's so many graphs. Lauren says XLV that's exactly correct. Literally 100 correct. Literally everything else is at least marginally participating in the upside here. Literally everything except XLV. XLV has been getting beaten down like a dog and it's not slowing down. It had one minor reprieve on the 12th and that was about it. So if we go to XLV just to look first at the sector level, this is what it looks like over the last six months.

It's getting smashed. Now we talked about this on Sunday and I literally told you guys that immediately following that conversation on Sunday. I put a position on to trade it to the downside. I went with long puts and short calls. So I made synthetic shorts and it's honestly just because I didn't have a sense of severity. There's no part of my body that expected this gap or this continuation or the next gap that we're seeing. That's not why the trade went on. And there's no way that I would take any credit for that movement. I didn't expect that severity. I expected the direction. But if I expected this full severity, I would have gone long out of the money puts at scale. That's exactly how I would have played this had I known the future, but I didn't. So that's why I went with synthetic shorts because it gives you a little bit of both worlds. You can kind of finance some of the long puts from the short calls.

You can kind of finance some of the long puts from the short calls. The problem with stuff like this is the ball is all on the put side. So you actually have to size up on the call side quite a bit in order to get something close to what you might want to finance the long puts. So not fully optimal, but you make it work, right? That's the whole idea here. But identifying opportunities like this is huge. And it's not just you and H, by the way, it's again, if we go back into XLV. As the sector, we've seen this for a while where it's underperforming literally the rest of the sectors. So when you see something doing that, it should always draw your attention even from a very loose perspective. And when I say loose perspective, I mean, even from like, hey, this sticks out to me. So if we take a look at the sectors and then we go into healthcare, let's take a look at the five day change. On the five day change, I don't know how many names are in this in total.

And that's absolutely a minority because I have to scroll twice, essentially, to get to the rest of this list. So this gives you good pot odds from finding things to trade to the short side. And the other thing to pay attention to as you're analyzing stuff like this is take a look at PODD. If we look into PODD, PODD just had a baller earnings release. Absolutely crushed it. Notice how EPS actually underperformed, but they had a good overall earnings release. Why am I showing you this? I'm showing you this because this gives you another great exercise to always add to your market analysis toolkit.

I still personally wouldn't to be completely honest with you. It's just not worth it. There's other opportunities out there. Is that a bad trade? I don't think it's terrible. But there's other stuff out there that's more appealing to me right now. However, you had better believe that this gets added to a watch list because we know PODD is doing really well when the majority of this sector is absolutely sucking wind. That's a good thing to keep in your back pocket because what do you think sometimes not always, but sometimes if in the near term if the timing lines up and health care for whatever reason starts seeing appreciation, a lot of times you'll see some of that bleed into the top performers. Now, you can apply a wrote system though and say, okay, I'm going to go long PODD once health care goes up because there's a momentum factor. And there's a really high chance for reversion in momentum, depending on what time frames you're analyzing.

And they might not be so that's something to pay attention to here. Now with momentum factor, something to keep in mind is typically speaking, there's a couple key time frames that matter a lot. So like one month, three months, six month, 12 month, those were like really common periods to analyze. Six months, 12 month, tend to have higher continuation. This is largely for growth stocks. One month, three month often have reversion. So not always it's again, it's a statistical measure. There will be plenty that don't, but it's something to keep in the back of your mind as you look at it. Because like seeing this kind of really good move over the course of one month, right, where a good majority of this move comes over the last month. Well, you kind of have to pay attention to that now this does not get overwhelmed by post earnings announcement drift, however, if you have a really strong catalyst like post earnings announcement drift that can overwhelm a lot of momentum reversion tendencies. Welcome to momentum, a lot of different factors. There's actually some really, really good studies",

Welcome to momentum, a lot of different factors. There's actually some really, really good studies out there. Let me find one of them for you from SSRN. This is intro day. I don't want that. No. This one. This one. So this one is a pre print. So it's nothing to overweight, but that is a great paper nonetheless. You just always have to again pay attention to what you're reading the pros and cons. This is also a really great paper and this one is useful for shorter term effects. I'll drop these really quick. In the discord so that you have access to them if you're interested in them, but these are really, really good to check out. If you're interested in momentum, which I feel like a lot of people generally should be interested in momentum. Because it is one of the simpler market effects that exists. So. Moody Blu says, can you take a look at AMD? It seemed to have broken down broken. It's downtrend. However, it's sold down this morning. Yeah, let's take a look. The broader tech moves here have been absolutely incredible. Let's see. Damn, that's a tough one. So. This still absolutely wouldn't be for me unless I thought there was some sort of big value",

But without some sort of value element to it, I don't like it here. And. Yeah, it's so tough because I feel like the reason I'm still conflicted here is because I feel like AMD is in such a great position to partake in such a significant amount of the broader AI adoption for a list of different reasons. And so, I think that's a lot of the way that I'm not participating in the AI. AMD is not participating well at all. So it creates a natural conflict in the way that I look at it. Because I do think that there is genuine opportunity here. And if you get into these things at lower levels, you reduce your overall risk. And if you get into the AI, you're going to have to be able to do a lot of things. And then you're going to have to be able to do a lot of things.

But again, if you're anywhere not even top ticking it, if you're anywhere up here, what I'm hovering on is the point of control, which is where the majority of people transacted over the last year, those people are down 52. And in total, I mean, they're just, they're not even close, right? Because remember the way that percentages work. When you're down 52, you need a significantly larger upside move in order to get back to break even. I have a table here that shows it to you on my website specifically for this reason, because it's useful here. So if you take a look, 52 down move, you need 100 in 604. You need in the reason why I'm adding 106 is you have to account for a little bit of the volatility component to it. But in a gross move, you need essentially double and change in order to get back.

You sit there just one little scratch at a time. Let me know it's time for him to come in. So let's see. I'm going to actually look more so at its earnings. I also don't know why they would use the trailing 12 month for the PE ratio. I care so much more about a forward PE. Yeah, I mean, like what this like does this shock you? I don't really care so much about HPE and C gate like you can call them closer or whatever. But specifically AMD to micron and IBM, I think that's a fair comparison. Take a look at the value. Right.

That's interesting. bid to offer. Let's take a look on a weighted basis. So this is either a pretty healthy bit of profit taking that you see. And that's incredible. The reason why I'm stuck on this is take a look at it on a relative basis. If we look over the last 30 days, I mean, you've not seen downside premium this heavy. So that's that's nuts. So a bunch of volume in the out of the money super short term that's. Part for the course. We look at open interest, which I'm more interested in. That's so funny. What a great pond. Yeah.

But I have to look at it in the context of like where's the opportunity and how does this stack against other opportunities that exist. And right now I just think there's so many great opportunities. If you're trying to do like near term recovery style trading that this one at least for me wouldn't be super high on the list. There's a lot of other stuff that I think looks really good. But it does have wind at its back at how to good earnings. It just has a really, really long history of a down move to work through right like this is just so much overhead resistance that companies that get bogged down like this. They have to get through so much shit before they can really start to rally. And it's this is why I like smaller growth names for directional trading a lot because a lot of them don't have the scars like this that they're going to have to overcome. If you look at something like Reddit. This is another great example of something that came out of the gate super hot. And it's starting to show more strength and I like the way that it's looking.

I'm not super big into candlestick analysis, but I do like looking at what candles represent in terms of supply and demand right the overall drivers of the market. And if you take a look at what happened it had a really aggressive up move on the day. And then the market started selling off into it the market start saying I'll start de-risking here some of these people maybe they're happy to get out at break even or whatever the cases. So when you have this near term overhead it always just serves as a natural suppressor to price. And you can always go through it. It's possible, but you need a strong enough catalyst the longer. The overhead is there and the deeper it is the more you need to overcome it. So then the question to me always is not is there a trade here the outlier way to think about it is is this the right place for my money. And that's why for me AMD wouldn't be right now.

GME issued the purpose of those notes is a slick way to be able to accumulate some capital to purchase Bitcoin without having to burn a bunch of their money. So that's really the purpose and it's a way to do it without near term dilution there is a potential dilution in the future depending on how they choose to resolve them.

Then it's a little too early to put those trades on in my opinion. So I see a few ways to play it. You can try to play the near term downside continuation. Expecting vault to continue to slowly climb. That's one way to go about it. And you can see that generally reflected here, right? 30 day term vault is sliding up. And then you can interpolate that out to near term vault and, you know, probably expect a similar near term trend of climbing into the release. So yeah, that's how I would generally look at it.

Let's take a look at Tesla for F R Tesla. Interesting. Tesla is notorious for how much volatility it carries. And if you ever needed a reminder of that, you can always look at average true range average day ranges for pretty much any reference period realistically. So because of that, I tend to like trading Tesla more from a vault perspective. Now, if somebody has a directional opinion in Tesla, I feel like the one of the only suitable ways I could even conceive of trying to trade that is with a longer term play in mind. Just because of how. How it moves is a way to consider. Riki says Tesla looks very do for a decent sized pullback. You can't look at markets that way. Like it's just not how it works. Right.

So with that in mind, I think trying to play things like that with the quote unquote like do for a pullback, unless you can quantify it in some sort of way and you're trying to play some sort of mean reversion than yes. So like for example, what I can tell you is over different periods. Tesla has displayed a pretty high tendency based on a Hurst exponent for price mean reversion. And then what I can do is actually quantify the price that it tends to mean revert to relative to current price. So right now it's a pretty fair Hurst exponent for a version back to like 279. So that doesn't mean that it will do that. But it means that there is absolutely a tendency for that kind of two sided movement. So one of the ways that I would play something like that if I was expecting some sort of pullback is I would literally just set a couple alerts. And then if it starts breaking down through this recent move, then I mean pretty much anything below here. Right. Once it starts falling meaningfully below like the",

    "text": "would play something like that if I was expecting some sort of pullback is I would literally just set a couple alerts. And then if it starts breaking down through this recent move, then I mean pretty much anything below here. Right. Once it starts falling meaningfully below like the 316 317 handle if it does. Then it starts to look like pretty likely to move down into the point of control. At least somewhat, but right now if it starts plowing through this volume node, then it's a pretty clear sign to me that it's bid and people want to speculate upside. So that's how I would play something like that. And with options for these kinds of things, especially really, really short term ideas. I generally speaking like to go further out in time, but these are the kinds of plays where I'm expecting to hold it for maybe five days if that. So I don't go out that far in time. It's not like more of a positional style play. It's like a very, very short term idea. So for those you would probably find me in like 30 day or 60 day options. I typically prefer the 60 days in this kind of thing, but the 30 day might be fine. I'd have to take a look and see what theta looks like comparatively. Let's see. These are at 33 cents. These are at 25 cents. I don't think these would have no gamma though. Yeah,",

So again, I don't look at these things and say like it's absolutely crashing. When do I think that this thing is going to go up? And it's because at some point it will likely go up, but while I'm sitting here trying to find that point in this, there are things that are already going up heavily following a really great earnings release, and I much prefer to trade that.

    "text": "place a trade is not, could there be a trade here? The answer or the question always is, is this the right place for my money? Like, is this the right trade? I am always looking for easier opportunities more than anything. I'm not looking to trade stuff that is wishy washy. I much prefer again, stuff like this, like very, very clear defined trends that I can try to capitalize on or break out. Again, I'll show you a really simple scan that I use pretty regularly. If we go to screener, let's just look for an earnings move. Let's say that we're looking for short deltas. We'll tighten this up to like the last three days, so it's a little more relevant. I'm going to move this off to the side that I can click through it faster. And let's see. So PFS PSFE. So this, the way that I would look to trade this is if there is essentially a continuation below where it's at now. And as a betting man, which is what I am, I do think that seems likely to occur. I don't know for sure. The market seem to like the call side of the equation, but again, if you take a look, most of it is short calls. So from an OI perspective, you can be misled and you could say, well, there's 9,000 calls against 2000 puts, but what I can tell you from the recent activity today is that there's",

So from an OI perspective, you can be misled and you could say, well, there's 9,000 calls against 2000 puts, but what I can tell you from the recent activity today is that there's a lot of short calls going out. So this is probably yet not super liquid. I mean, it's fine. If you have a small account, you're only trading a few lots. But this is like I would much prefer monitor this. Well, let's see. These are kind of tough with like these really just big parabolic drops. This, I mean, it's super cheap, but really high ball. The thing I would trade just short premium. But these are more so the types of like downside, directional ideas. That I would want to tinker with. And then for upside, there's tons that have had a really good earnings. There's literally tons and tons and tons of names. I got 213 returns in the scan for upside is compared to downside. So the market is absolutely showing a little bit of upside strength here. I think for sure. Anything else you guys want to talk about? I want to poke through maybe like a poster to from Reddit. I like doing those towards the end of the stream just so that we can see what's happened. And we'll take a look in options. Let's see what's going on here. And let's do.",

Options trading strategy sharing. Okay. Let's take a look at this one. This says thinking of getting into some long term 2027 at the money options. I only have experience with six month out expertise. I don't even know what that means. What are your general recommendations for managing gains or losses? I usually wait to lock in when Delta is closer to 08. I'm going to have a 30 to 50 gain should I just be making the play with 12 months and then. So this I like because they're asking the question. But like this is a. This is a really ignorant perspective to carry on trading options. Because so like this, right? And we're talking about. If you're getting into longer dated options. And the first question is you have to ask yourself why? Why am I getting into this option? Does this make sense? To me, if you're going into these longer dated options, it's literally just because you want to hold something with leverage for a longer duration. Like that's the point that you would go out",

Like that's the point that you would go out to 2027. That's okay if you are. That should inform the way that you're managing gains or losses. It shouldn't be based on Delta. If like who cares if Delta moves Delta will move for different reasons. I think what matters way more is what's your price expectation for the underlying and does it do that? So and then it says should I be making the play within 12 months so like this again, it just is kind of. Kind of random. It looks like the cliff notes version for what I see here is like what I very regularly see, which is somebody that doesn't understand options. And they're trying to piece together an approach, which is fine, but they don't understand options. And if you understand options, you start to answer most of these questions for you because they're asking the wrong ones like worrying about what expiration if they're going to go to 2027 or 12 months or whatever. And none of that really matters yet until you have the broader plan built, which is what do you expect the underlying to do and why are you using options in the first place based on that. That's",

That's how I would build a management approach. This is super common. They're not doing anything that all of us haven't done before, but this is just kind of like cobbling it together as you're going, which typically doesn't work super great with options, especially this style.
