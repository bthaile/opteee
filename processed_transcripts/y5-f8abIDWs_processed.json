    "text": "What up, allires, quick market update. Somebody asked if I could take a look at Palantir and you know the answer. It's typically yes, if I can take a look at something that folks are interested in, I'm always happy to. So there was actually an interesting article that lined up really well with why I wanted to do this video and I'll grab the article right now from seeking alpha. I do not know this dude at all. This is just reviewing his work and then we're going to take a look at the stock, but I just want to caveat that this really lined up pretty well. I have to say and there was a couple of them that seemed to be talking about the same thing, right? So if I look at this person unlikely to end well, this one says from rights research, again, I'm unfamiliar with pretty much all of these. This says needs in and video moment to justify its valuation. This person from the polls says I was wrong, but I'm not a buyer. So really interesting actually as I'm flipping through this, I didn't expect to see quite that level of negative sentiment overall from the jump, especially for a stock that has made this level of a move. We've gone from 21 to 66 as of today in the last six months. So this is always an interesting conversation and it's always an interesting like differing of opinions between two different",

So this is always an interesting conversation and it's always an interesting like differing of opinions between two different trains of thoughts. And I can tell I haven't read through these yet. We're going to, but I can tell from a very high level, there's probably a significant value component to the way that these people are looking at markets. And I find it again, really interesting when people challenge the valuation of things because we can see stuff like PE ratios have gotten blown so far out. And PE ratios, while important metrics, they're very relative. And this is an Eric's opinion. This is based on a breadth of research that's available literally to everybody to give you you an idea of some of these. You can check out this one by Easton that talks about different kinds of earnings, earnings growth ratios. This one really talks about some of the simplistic nature of earnings by price and price earnings growth and that you actually need to expand a little bit more and include something like what this paper is identified. This is from Brooks and Anderson and this is about using a long term PE ratio as compared to a short term PE ratio, which is very skew prone. So using something that's actually using the past",

This is from Brooks and Anderson and this is about using a long term PE ratio as compared to a short term PE ratio, which is very skew prone. So using something that's actually using the past eight years as compared to the last year or two. And then this paper from Zimmerman, which talks about the interpretation of PE ratios again as it compares to growth. So you can check these out at your own leisure. The main reason why I highlight though is that when we use just PE ratios, we can find things that look crazy, right? Like this is saying now it's trading at 177.2 times the forward PE ratio and that sounds psychotic. But the other thing to always remember that lots of companies maintain very high PE ratios for long durations of time. Now I want to be clear, this is not me defending, palancerant any way. This is me talking about PE ratios as a concept so that people can keep that in the back of their minds because when again, we apply a standard value mindset as a trader, we see wow, like this is a, this is just a crazy surplus. If you apply this to like any standard debt metric that our minds are probably defaulting to this skews the way we receive the information.

Whereas if you look at it objectively over a much broader data set, you'll find stuff that has crazy high PE ratios, especially in places like tech and whatnot, that just keep flying. So that's not to say that they're a great bargain. That's not to say that there's value. But from a trading perspective, what ultimately matters to somebody like me is does the price go up. I don't care if it goes up because of momentum drift value because your grandma likes it and bought it and she has a bunch of money and drives the price up. I couldn't care less what makes it go up as long as these candles keep going up, that's what I ultimately care about. So this I thought was really interesting and I wanted to poke through this one really quick and then actually take a look through the options chain and stuff like that. And let's see, let's see what this person has to say. It looks like they've been covering it for a while. They rated it as a sell due to over valuation, limited growth, bearish calls successful about a year. See, and again, this is the problem, right? To me, looks like somebody that is trying to cope a",

To me, looks like somebody that is trying to cope a little bit because if you're talking about somebody that's using stuff like PE ratios, that's not something that reflects in value overnight. Meaning this is inherently somebody that's talking about this from an investment time frame, right? And you can see that reflects well here, might not end well for buyers in two to three years. So this I find a little again, just copie. Or we're saying that it's good for about a year and then it wasn't. So I would rather just talk about stuff objectively. But anyways, due to the persistent over valuation, couldn't upgrade, pal, and here to buy. Again, I don't know if that's just like something with their model. I don't know this person. They could have a very specific model that they looked to follow, but I personally would find this a constraint in a model if this is the premise work. Or it might call into question what the system of valuation is if you have something that is considered overvalued. But then let's see when they change, I don't know when they change their rating.

Now I want to be clear as I'm looking through this, anybody can make a call that's wrong. So I'm not getting on them at all for putting something out there that clearly ended up not being the case simply because it like just because they're putting their opinions out there publicly, obviously it will get a little more scrutiny. But I like I've made plenty of wrong calls. I am not pretending like I'm any better than anybody else at all. All that being said, I just want to see how this has moved since they talked about it. So it was about 20s up until the 66th handle now. Okay. So then they upgraded to a hold in February of 23. So I don't really know what that means. It's a good timing, great timing on that quote unquote upgrade. I mean, this looks like it would be a buy. I can tell that they're using very much a standard value perspective, right?

So I would give this partial credit, right? I think upgrading it doesn't, upgrading it to a hold doesn't mean buy. So that essentially means that there's no purchase going on there. So I wouldn't call that correct. But not putting it as like a seller, whatever they maintain, that's good. So let's see. I could give balls another catalyst, glowing over valuation, limited returns, years ahead. Today we see the company's growing bounds and leaps, leaps and bounds, I guess, leaps and bounds. That sounded weird when I said bounds and leaps. Believe the current valuation is primarily driven by unrealistic hope and overextended expectations rather than tangible fundamentals. And I don't, again, from one of the things that we have to keep in mind when we look at stuff like this are different perspectives. They're applying a very different lens. They're applying a value investing lens. So there's, I completely agree with them from a value perspective. This absolutely looks very, very, very overvalued.

So let's take a quick look at actually what's going on here at Accuracity. On a one year timeframe, we've gone from 15 to 67. On the six month we already looked at, we've essentially tripled. And on a three month timeframe, it's still in a really, really aggressive growth phase. The other thing I want to highlight is earnings smashed. It was expected as a nickel and it came out of the dime. So two times expected earnings is really, really solid. Its earnings performance here also did a great job. It was expected at four cents came in at nine. So the reason why that matters to me is because earnings growth is a big factor for stuff like this. And this is a, from a, a traders perspective changing the lens to my lens. A positive post earnings announcement drift is a thing. And it's exhibited it here so far. It's exhibited it here so far.

And it's exhibited it here so far. It's exhibited it here so far. It's a really dominant effect. Again, that's well researched. You can learn about it as much as you'd like online. You can go to SSR and check it out. So there's tons of information out there. So from a chart perspective, from a trading lens, this looks great to me. There's nothing I'm seeing that's freaking me out. Stuff is going to consolidate. It's going to contract. That doesn't mean it's straight up from here. I have no idea. That's not the way that I trade trying to predict with any sort of precision. I try to play probabilistic moves. And as long as it continues this sort of trajectory, it looks bullish to me. And then as soon as this starts leveling off too much volume starts expanding and it's dropping those kinds of things, that's not good. And that makes me take some pause. Now I do see RSI is heavily overextended here without a doubt. It's been overextended essentially from here, which is pretty intense to be honest, because the RSI with a seven day view out moving average generally doesn't hold this kind of configuration. So it is definitely redlining on a relative strength index perspective. So let's take a look at",

It's been overextended essentially from here, which is pretty intense to be honest, because the RSI with a seven day view out moving average generally doesn't hold this kind of configuration. So it is definitely redlining on a relative strength index perspective. So let's take a look at some options here. We have 1.7 million calls against 1.4 million puts. And we are all over the map in terms of explorations. We have stuff everywhere. We do absolutely have moderate calls skew here. Now if we take a look at some of the near term explorations for kind of a better look at what we're expecting near term over the next two primary exploration cycles, it's been 40 versus 664. And then in the 20 Ds, it's 308 to 272,000. Oh, I so yeah, I mean, it's kind of in the short term people, it's a mixed bag. So that tells me that there's got to be larger skew that starts to emerge like as we get further out here, 17 April. This is typically a bigger exploration cycle about matched 129 to 125. And then out in 19 set, it's actually inverted with 55,000 puts against 51 on the call side. That's the first we saw that same thing in oct. And then all the way out in Jan 26, you could tell people are pretty bullish where we have 165,000 against 109. So yeah, I mean, overall positioning here definitely still looks slightly bullish.

So yeah, I mean, overall positioning here definitely still looks slightly bullish. I would call it slightly bullish. And we do have decent IV, but nothing is drawing my eye excessively. Now I want to take a look at the vol. Let's take a look at the averages first. And then we'll do the out of the monies. And yeah, I mean, this doesn't surprise me. It's take a look at that out of the monies. It's favor in the put side as per usual. And yeah, I mean, there's nothing sticking out to me here from like a weird vol perspective or anything like that, except this 20 June being this elevated relative to those, but that's a vol thing that doesn't really matter for this overall, like just looking at broader positioning. So yeah, I mean, this, it looks fine to me. I don't see anything in here that's leading me to believe that we're unwinding superfast or anything. A couple of the things to look at quick. If we take a look at insider sales for the past month, there's a couple in here that are a little heavy. So we can see like this changing 23 18 of ownership.

This stuff doesn't look too crazy, 5 4 that's people generally taking comp out on things that are at really high levels on a relative basis. So don't, don't hate them for that at all. But this is a little interesting because these are, these are bigger. These are absolutely bigger trades. And let's see what they have going on. And you can see that there's a little bit of a rationale here. So this says transaction represents automatic sale of shares to cover required tax with holding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock units. So yeah, nothing in here that is alarming to me. Then a lot of this looks to be structurally driven. So yeah, I mean, from an insider trading perspective, I like to see if they're going to have a big sponsorship flipping around. And definitely more on the sell side than buy side, there's absolutely no doubt about that. But it doesn't look like there's a mass exit is turning to like that.

There's a lot of wind at its back from a pure trading lens. It's still showing strength. So until it doesn't show strength, that's when I change my opinion. I apply Bayesian statistics. I'm not out here making calls like people talk about. I don't care at all about that. I care about making money. And a big part of that when you come to analyzing the price of individual tickers is applying a Bayesian analysis. That means this new information comes out. We then change what we're doing based on that new information. And it's simply because it's difficult from a trader's perspective to project out what might be in 52 weeks. I have no idea what can happen over 52 weeks. So there's no way I could say I love this thing a year out from now because my job as a trader is to trade movements as they're happening. Now from a value traders or value investors perspective, it's completely different. They're looking to find things that are at really good relative values compared to the probability of the business doing really well in the future. And they play those longer, longer moves dealing with the shorter term price variation. So just a difference in approach, really, really interesting article. There's nothing in",
