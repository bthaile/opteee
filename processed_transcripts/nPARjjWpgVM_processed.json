    "text": "game stop is showing some signs of life. Get ready for your Tuesday update on the crowd favorite game stop. We're going to just take a look at the stock, take a look at the options. We'll talk about some position updates. And to kick us off, just like I have been doing on these Tuesday videos, you just want to recap what we covered in the game stop analysis live stream from this last Saturday, it's every Saturday at 5 p.m. Pacific time. And we kind of ran through the DD library again. So we looked at a few things we had. There was essentially one or two of them that I would consider to be like true research. One of it was likening us to the O8 crash. And obviously that hasn't really played out because the broad idea is that we're due for like another big crash. But I like the research specifically related to the O8 crash. Now the parallel and the transition from the O8 crash into game stop, I thought was a little bit weak in terms of the, you know, the actual correlation. But I still thought it was interesting nonetheless. And then the rest of the stuff we were looking at was a game of funny memes. There was somebody that really enjoyed doing Lego memes. So they made like a whole book of it, which is pretty funny. And then there was a general magazine. It was like a national geographic",

And then there was a general magazine. It was like a national geographic design, almost, which was pretty neat. So we are still working through the top theories and analysis. This is we wrapped up part 14. So this is over 20 hours now. Just looking at the top theories, not including the overall game stop analysis. That's been on stream for now 32 episodes. This is pretty fun. Cool. So that's stuff aside. Let's take a look at the stock itself because it's in a very interesting spot here. So as everybody knows, game stop absolutely had been contracting for quite some time now. A lot of it actually looked to be in my opinion, some type of institutional selling. And again, I don't go into the world of whether that's institutional selling to suppress the price or anything like that. I'm just talking from a standard market behavior perspective. This that's what it looked like because it wasn't tied to any specific news. There was a slight uptick in overall average volume. And that to me looks like some sort of entity that's looking to unwind a long position that they might have in it. Now that's complete conjecture. I don't know. Let's just fairly calm in based on this kind",

Now that's complete conjecture. I don't know. Let's just fairly calm in based on this kind of pattern configuration. So then that move digested out. We came into a couple really important levels. The first one was the 26 and a half level, which we fell right down through that. And then we were hovering at 25 and a half. And I was actually pretty nervous if we were to fall below 25 and a half. And we did. Now the cool part about this is on the fall through 25 and a half. You can actually see that there's really nothing in here as far as a volume profile. There's just not a lot of transactions. Now the reason why that's so important is because that means there's not a lot of legacy buying at that level. It's kind of no man's land. And if we zoom this into a three month daily, you can see the same thing here. There's just not a lot of volume being transacted at. However, it did come to find some pretty firm support on the 200 day moving average. And then it had a really strong day yesterday on the 10th. You can see that it rallied pretty hard through this overall descending channel, which is good. Now",

Now I don't think we're out of the woods yet because if you take a look again, just from a standard technical analysis perspective, let me get rid of that one and grab the line for you guys like the trend line so I can show you what I'm seeing, which is from here down to here. It's still very much in a pretty confirmed downtrend. It's just starting to lighten up in terms of the slope, at least in the near term time frame and a long term time frame, it's still unequivocally upward sloping, you know, appreciating. So this was really well received. And essentially it gapped up to 25 and a half and then it rallied all the way up to 27. So that was a really, really big day again on relatively light news. But this is again, it looks to be institutional sponsorship of some sort that looks that is exactly what that looks like to me. Now this is the broader value area is far as I see it. And now this becomes near term support on the downside and it still looks like it's generally descending. So it's a game of wait and see.",

We have to see from a price action perspective how it behaves, but it is good that it found some support on the 200 day MA. There's definitely some interest there. Now to the upside, there is a really significant volume node in here, which I'll highlight it for you so that you can see. So it doesn't surprise me at all to see the price meander up into that and then get pushed back down. The reason being is very frequently when we get into this kind of price area, people that were in at these levels after it fell down to 24 ish, they're happy to get out at a break even. So that's for the people that are more actively trading it. So this still looks like GameStop is near term downtrend. It looks like it's decelerating the downtrend a little bit, which is good. These are starting these channels are widening out. And now the game is to see if it starts to approach this prior high and then this prior high to get above right now, what will essentially be a supply zone for people to to offload.

And now the game is to see if it starts to approach this prior high and then this prior high to get above right now, what will essentially be a supply zone for people to to offload. Now in terms of volatility, volatility really hasn't moved that much. So you can see implied volatility percentile still just down at 6, which is very, very light for GameStop. The implied volatility itself is at 77 and a half, which again on a gross basis that's still quite high. And the reason why that's important is because for people like me and the position I've been showing you trading the covered strangle in GameStop, this volatility even though it's relatively low to GameStop, it's still very, very high. So to give you an example of what I mean by that, let's say if you wanted to sell a put and let me grab a worksheet here so that we can just kind of look at it together. So if I wanted to sell a put here and it's the 24 strike. So the 24 strike and we're looking at a 0.27 delta 0.27. And then if we take a look at the premium, we get it's kind of really wide. Well, let's call it like 98 cents, something like that. 0.98, that's the premium you get.

And if you have no context on if that's good, batter and different, this will mean that much to you. So that's actually why I want to help give you some context. So let's take a look at in equivalent. I'm now going to pivot over to spy. We're going to stay in the same expiration that 38 days to expiration. I'm going to find the same delta so that we can look at the commensurate. So this one's GameStop. This one will be not SPT. In fact, this one will be SPY. So let's take a look now at spy. So the strike for a 27 delta here is like the 590, so 590.27, which is great that it lines up perfectly. And at that 27, you're going to get 499, 4.99.

So because GameStop is so volatile, in general, even though right now it's relatively not compared to itself, you're getting 3.24 more money on a relative basis. So that's why right now trading something like GameStop is so attractive, even though the volatility is low. And this leads to another important point again from a trader's lens, which as most of you probably know by now, that's the primary lens that I apply when I'm looking at markets because it's how I make a living. I am a trader. So if we take a look at what you can make in something in GameStop, what I'm doing is I'm grabbing the coverage strangle as it sits in the portfolio right now here. I can show you what we have. So this is the coverage strangle as it sits in GameStop. And what this means is on a relative basis, you can collect a lot of money relative to how much money you're putting up. So right now, I still have just 250 shares, so that puts me at 28 of my exposure of this 78 in total, 28 of it is in shares. And this is actually an ideal time for me to start scooping up some",

And this is actually an ideal time for me to start scooping up some more shares. Now, what I don't like to do is buy shares and things as it's contracting too quickly, right? Because I need to see where it goes. But now is actually a pretty good accumulation zone. Now that we see that it's behaved around here pretty well. And I actually started looking to buy shares at this breakthrough. But I didn't in this model section of the portfolio simply because we don't have that much left. Meaning we only have 20 of the capital left of an allocated amount. The reason why that's so important is because through the cash secured put side of the equation, even as GameStop is having these kinds of moves, it can be really lucrative. You can make a lot of money. And then again, when it looks good, you can roll that money into buying shares when you are prepared to. So the reason why I'm talking about this opportunity is for this right here. This is looking at volatility. And you can see that overall implied volatility, this is looking at 30 day vol. It's absolutely contracting massively. It used to be up to 130 now. It's down to 93 in this",

It's absolutely contracting massively. It used to be up to 130 now. It's down to 93 in this reference range. And you can see, though, that realize volatility, which is the gray line. Don't worry about the purple line at all. Pretend it's not there. The gray line is one month realized of all. So 21 days technically or 20 days. And you can see that they're starting to converge on one another. But there's still so much excess of all compared to the realize volatility. That leads to strong opportunity from short premium perspectives, which is exactly what the coverage triangle is. So now let's take a quick look at GameStop related news. And I want to take a look at it starting from here because I saw it come through on a handful of different things. So we can see that there was the picture from Ryan Cohen with the former MicroStrategy CEO, Michael Sailor, which was put the internet ablaze. Lots of people. We're really, really curious about what that all means. And GameStop started moving on that. I think a lot of people are starting to become curious if GameStop potentially might be getting involved in Bitcoin. And you can see they didn't comment on anything. I think that right now GameStop is playing",

I think a lot of people are starting to become curious if GameStop potentially might be getting involved in Bitcoin. And you can see they didn't comment on anything. I think that right now GameStop is playing their cards pretty close to their chest. So you can see that this came across a bunch of different news sources. And it likely is a significant reason behind the price behavior that you see. Because if there are institutions that see GameStop continuing to make its pivot and they really like the potential direction it might go, then this starts to become really, really interesting. So overall, it looks like the movement towards Bitcoin is really well received. It's something that a lot of people have been talking about, but we have to wait and see if that's what materializes or not. Again, it looks like they're playing the cards really, really close to the chest. So as always, if you have any questions, anything you want me to take a look at, let me know. Be an outlier.
