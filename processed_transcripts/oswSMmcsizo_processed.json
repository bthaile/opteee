    "text": "pay attention to term volatility. All that means is each expiration cycle is going to have its own volatility and implied volatility. And you can learn a lot about the way that this looks. Now we talk about things like term structure, which is what is the term volatility. Across all these different expressions, and you can plot it to see it more simply, or you can just always look at the numbers and see what sticks out to you. So for example, the fact that this two-may expiration is all the way up at 80, and then everything else is kind of like in the 40s, else is something, and obviously it has earnings during this expiration cycle. So you can go through and come up and say, well, this one seems really low compared to something else, and then you might be able to trade relative volatility compared to cheap terms, compared to more expensive terms. But there's a lot of information baked into term volatility. It's worth checking out, being out on our sale later.",
