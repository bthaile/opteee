    "text": "Bit of a mixed bag out there today. So I want to do a quick market update. And then I also want to apologize to you guys. There's a couple of things I have to come clean on which I'll get into in just a few minutes. So talking about the markets first, we have a lot of capitulation that's happening right now. And it's across all of the indices. Notice that we had the SP 500 that was down three quarters of a percent today. And then the Russell was down almost 2 bid back up to about 1.9. So yeah, overall some some pretty fair weakness going on. But this isn't like falling out of bed. Can't get up kind of weakness. This looks like a lot of things that have had a insane run from about April mid April until now. So it's kind of like if you were to go out and sprint as fast as you can sooner or later, even if you're that dude that can run a sub two hour marathon or whatever the hell it is, you got to take a break sooner or later. So that's kind of what this is to me. I see not a significant display of weakness across the market as I look across breath indicators. I see net highs lows. For example, is turning down net highs is absolutely coming down. But it's not diving into lows just yet. Although lows are now starting to expand.",

So you can see yesterday is hovering right around 39 today. It's down to 67. So this starts accelerating meaningfully. That starts to become more of a concern to me. But right now it's still in kind of this middle zone that doesn't cause for much concern in my opinion. It looks like a bit of a pullback going on on the game stop and why I need to apologize to you guys. It is because I sold my long options today. And here's what happened. The market opened and we kind of hovered around here. It didn't look like we were breaking out anywhere. So literally all I did was set an alert for anything above 2898 to get back in. And I said, eh, it looks like we're stalling out. I'm going to take the longs down. But I played a little bit of a game with the market because we all know that the market essentially knows what I think and what you think.

Out of the longs, you keep the short calls against the shares now that I don't want to unwind yet. And you think that that would send the market higher. It didn't work. Unbelievably, it didn't work. I ended up actually closing the calls for a nice profit on the short side as well. So I made money on both the long and short calls. But you know, the game plan didn't work. The market obviously knew what I was doing. And it didn't play any games out here today. So it did not fall for my trap. It was per usual. That was like a last ditch effort to make this work for everybody. And it didn't happen. So my bad. I'll have to be smarter next time. It must have known about the shares. That's what I'm missing here. It knew that I didn't want to unwind the shares. And it was like, fine, get rid of the calls. I'm going to punish the shares. That's got to be what it's on about.

And if GameStop goes below this alert that I just said, I'm going to sell. So we'll see what happens. GameStop your move. So what's going on in here though? It does look like GameStop is rolling over a little bit. There's no doubt about it. It's hovering right around this point of control. There's a lot of people continuing to transact here. When I look at the overall view of volume for today, it's much lighter. So the volume contracted meaningfully below the two week average. Now the other thing that I want to highlight from what I'm seeing here at least is the sale volume is not chilling out. The sale volume is like 90 today. So there are no shortage of people unwinding for various reasons. There's a lot of speculation as to what's going on there, but it's clear it's happening and it's having an effect on the price. How much of this is just because of GameStop being GameStop? Probably a lot of it, but there's also a broad market weakness. So if you look across small caps in general, they're",

And you can take a look at that if we go into something like the visualized tab and we grab the Russell. It's a lot of red. It's a lot of red. You wouldn't want this to be what you're open your portfolio up to because everything is getting crushed. All I'm highlighting is that there's very few segments of strength right now. Although there are some in things like financials, energy, those things are not underperforming. So poorly right now builders are doing okay. Small cap financials are getting killed, but large cap is not quite so bad. It's still not great to be clear, but they're not like getting hammered as what we're seeing over here in the financials on the small capside. They're really getting beat up. So let's take a look at the option screen. We know already that I'm out of my front positions via options. I'm waiting for a reentry. We have a ton of volume today.

There was no slowdown, 360,000 contracts traded against for calls against 100,000 puts for the calls the vast majority, the overwhelming majority here is in 19 July. We can take a look at that at 212. If we go out and we look at this 26 July expiration, there's activity there, but it does look like the 16 augs are starting to enter the equation. That's what these yellow rectangles are people getting in there. So if we compare those really fast for next week's expiration, it's only 79,000. This is essentially 80,000 calls versus 32,000 puts. And then in 16 aug, it's 32,800 against 9615. So what I'm seeing now is also fairly standard for what I'm starting to pick up as kind of normal for a game stop where the front expiration cycle, especially if it's an op-x is way busier. And then the weeklies tend to slow down a little bit. And then the monthly as it comes up, probably will start to pick up a bit. You can see that being reflected here, literally in the implied volatility. The implied volatility for the rest of this week, all one day left is 155. Drops to 131, 129, 125, then back up to 131 and a half. That's a meaningful discrepancy between these. And again, it does have earnings coming up on the 4th of September. This is not",

It's elevated because it's a primary expiration op-x for game stop, which is still not chilled out yet in a massive way at least. So I want to highlight a couple other things really fast as I look at this. The volume today was light. So I looked at the total premium transactions. And I mean, we have what? One, two, three, four, five trades that are above 100,000. So we have, yeah, whoever this is at 99,000, could you not have just done 1000 more so that it could be in this, you selfish human being? Come on now. And they sold the puts. They're bullish here. They sold puts and they couldn't do a thousand dollars more. Unbelievable. Sometimes people are so selfish. So it's just slowing down. It's slowing down a lot is what I'm seeing in the options chains. Again, like if we go back to the 17th and we take a look at some of the transactions we were seeing there, take a look at how many were above 100,000, a much more significant amount with the top three topping of million dollars",

    "text": "seeing in the options chains. Again, like if we go back to the 17th and we take a look at some of the transactions we were seeing there, take a look at how many were above 100,000, a much more significant amount with the top three topping of million dollars combined. I'm not even looking at their bots sold. I don't really care in this case. They're pretty much all bullish trades. But I just want to see how engaged are these options chains? How busy are they? We go back to the 16th same story. Tons and tons of positions getting put on, but you'll notice something. A lot of these positions are not for this front expiration. This is a prime example of people who have money making informed decisions with how they're structuring trades. Notice how many of these big positions that were put on for the 16th were for the Friday, this coming Friday, the 19th of July. I am looking, I see one for the 26th of July and then I see two down here for the 19th. That's pretty much it. This shows you where people typically that have decent resources available to them, how they set up their trades. There's a reason why they're not in these super short term explorations. To me so far, it is a function of keeping eye on things as I've been very closely looking for any sort of interesting activity that really starts to peak my interest.",

To me so far, it is a function of keeping eye on things as I've been very closely looking for any sort of interesting activity that really starts to peak my interest. Some of these transactions, like these 25s, these are for tomorrow, bro. This was at the 25s, they came in at 290, so they came in right at the offer and they paid 137,000. Fingers crossed. I hope it works for them, but then I also look at that and I think tough, tough way to make a few bucks. Gotta be honest with you. We'll see how that pans out for them. If we look at those 25s and they're right now trading for 1.10, they got in at 290. So they've essentially cut down to a third of what their overall cost was in a day, literally today. This is the fun and the beauty of trading really, really short term options is they give it and they take it. And from our home boy that came in at 0731 Pacific time with those 25 calls, 471 of them. Salute to you, homie, but that's not looking great. And again, this isn't to shit on them. I genuinely, I hope this prints tomorrow. I really do, but you can see that they obviously didn't put this trade on for 290, expecting it to go to 1.10 if I'm",
