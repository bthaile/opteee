    "text": "I got a DM asking what happened to the volatility in GameStop today and the goal of this video is to walk you through exactly that my hope is to try and help share more details on how we can interpret volatility from the options chain and review it for information and potentially some ideas on where the markets might be pricing and things to move options markets are very smart now another thing is if you haven't seen the video I put out earlier today on how to buy options smarter specifically in something like GameStop you should check that out I will throw it in the description below because volatility is such an important part of trading options and a lot of people got burned today because of that so let's do a quick recap on the 20th of June volatility was up to 247 per. this is very high and as we got closer into the expiration typically you will see volatility can do a bunch of different things but unless there's a perception of a big move that remains there typically you will see the expected move kind of contract volatility kind of contract because as there's less time there's typically a smaller expected range the way to think about that is if you were to guess about the total price range of GameStop over the next day or one 100 days which of those do you think would have a bigger price range 100 days",
