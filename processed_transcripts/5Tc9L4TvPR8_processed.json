    "text": "What's up, outliers? Today we're going to talk about how to trade zero DT options for beginners. I have a playlist that talks about zero DT options in a bunch of different ways, because it's something that I regularly do myself. However, there are a ton of traps and especially for small accounts. So the goal for this video is to walk you through in orientation on what these are, how to think about them, how to potentially start using them in a way that's more likely to at least give you some runway before lighting all of your money on fire as compared to the droves of people you see on Reddit. That essentially are gambling and yolowing their money and zero DT options, trying to guess what direction something is going to go on the last 42 seconds of the day using all of their life savings and then wondering why it didn't work out. Let's start first with understanding what's going on here with zero DT options. First and foremost, what are zero DT options? Super simple. They are contracts that expire on the same day. Now, when we discuss zero DT options, it refers to the daily expiration cycle, whereas one stupid note, but worth mentioning, is zero DT's have been around before. It's just not every day, right? You just have to wait until options expiration third Friday, the month until more and more have been added. But come of May of 22 and specifically",

You just have to wait until options expiration third Friday, the month until more and more have been added. But come of May of 22 and specifically the indices first. So think SPX and DX places like that they added Tuesday Thursday, expiration to complete the existing one. They was a Friday AKA now we have daily expirations. This is been spread out a little bit into some of the smaller brother and sister indices. So SPX has XSP, which is attempt the size that also will have zero DT ease and then same thing with spy. There's a couple of very important differences though when we're talking about these that you have to pay attention to, we'll get to that in a little bit. So why are they popular and how popular are they? Well, let's take a look. This is from Cebo and we can see based on exhibit two that options are now over 50 of XPX volume. It represents over a trillion dollars, notional value trading every single day. It's an incredible, an incredible adaptation of the market, but then also adoption from users. And the interesting thing here is that it provides a fascinating use factor for both retail and institutions. Now, unfortunately, most of the time retail is going to do what I was just explaining.

Now, unfortunately, most of the time retail is going to do what I was just explaining. They're going to try to use some sort of technical indicator and they're going to try to guess directionally, which way something is going to go and probably the most difficult time frame to do it. This is not say it's impossible. It's just really, really hard to do consistently over time. I've been trading for over 18 years now and the really short term time frames I've studied them at nauseam. They're super difficult and it's because they're the price movement that happens in those time frames is based on things that you cannot accurately forecast. They can be done based on somebody just choosing to adjust their book for one reason or another. There's not a technical indicator that gets you to that. There is over the long run when you start talking days, weeks, months, you start to be able to actually analyze things with a little more efficacy. So the reason why all this matters is because when we're talking about zero DT options, they really are a binary event in the amplify price movements. Now, for retail traders, they have a way to speculate on something that's super cheap. If you look at zero DT options, they're very cheap, funny",

Now, for retail traders, they have a way to speculate on something that's super cheap. If you look at zero DT options, they're very cheap, funny enough, on a relative basis. They're actually very expensive, which we'll talk about. But then institutions have a use case here because then they don't have to carry a hedge for an additional time frame if there's a specific event that they want to hedge through. Let's say the Fed is coming out with a statement. They don't want to unwind their positions. They can use shorter term options in addition to all the other institutional purposes, speculation, market making, all that kind of stuff. So the way to think about zero DT options is it's kind of like any other option, but it's on crack cocaine. And it's because everything is going to move super fast, and it has to make a really big decision. Every single option has a decision to make. So if we go to spy, this is after the close and we open up the 10 June expiration, what do you notice about the delta for everything that's out of the money? It's effectively zero, zero point two. These are learning a little bit, but these will also be zero. And then everything that's in the money is the delta of one. Every option has",

It's going to either have a delta of zero, meaning it's out of the money, has no value anymore, or it's going to be in the money and worth whatever the intrinsic value is. It's a big choice. And we can actually measure this choice that options make. And that's one of the beautiful things about the Greeks. Is they give us a view to assess how these options behave, but take a look at this specific bullet point. We know that there is a cheap way to speculate. This is the standard sensation seeking side. That's not what I would emulate at all. But then there's actually a fairly practical side. High volatility risk premium embedded in these ultra short dated options. There is persistent risk premium index options in general, and especially now in zero DTEs. So there's an interesting opportunity here. And if you can read between the lines, you probably know which way I'm taking you so far. So now let's talk about how these options behave.

And I'll show you exactly why it's more profound than you might understand. Now there's a couple general traits that are useful to know. And I'll show you a couple things quickly. The first thing we're going to look at is spy. And it's because it has volume. Now when I'm trading zero DTEs, most often I'm using European style options. So think SPX. And it's because they're cash settled. There's no assignment. And there is no exercise risk in terms of early exercise or having a position where part of it's in the money and you don't want to take the inventory of shares on all that goes away with the cash settled index. But we'll start with spy because again, it has volume. I want you to notice something. Take a look at the beginning of the day. You notice how high this volume is relative. Then if you take a look at the end of the day, the volume is also very high. And then sometimes you'll see these spikes throughout the day here and here. That's random. If",

If you take a look at the day prior, again, you can see the same thing, beginning of the day, high volume kind of trails down throughout the day and then peaks at the end of the day. What I'm showing you is markets get very busy for 30 minutes after the open and 30 minutes into the close. If you're trading zero DTEs, you have to know this because let's say, for example, you're trying a buy strategy and you choose to buy in the first part of the day. Well, there's a good chance you're buying really expensive premium that is going to quickly contract. And then your trade is going to be in a compromised position from the jump. And now I would like to show you why that's the case. I want you to focus on this little table that I made for you. This is measuring the Greeks. This is actually using yesterday. It doesn't matter.

It doesn't matter if it's a putter or call in the context of this. I just want to show you the relationships and the impacts the Greeks have relative to the premium. So I have three different expressions. I've one date expiration, 39 days of expiration and 221 days to expiration. And notice when we take a look at the Greeks, Delta Gamma Theta Vega. Notice what portion of this premium Delta Gamma Theta and Vega take up for a one day option. So this is after the close looking at an option that expires the next day. Then make that same comparison of Delta Gamma Theta Vega of a 39 DTE option. And then do the same for this 221 DTE option. And before I tell you what do you see? There are some very important things to pick up. The first thing is literally everything except Vega is amplified massively. The other thing you'll notice is that is you get closer and closer in time. The amplification increases because if we take a look at these 221 day options, Delta makes up 1.57 of the premium. Gamma is 0.02 and Theta is 0.31. So super, super low. Then if we go to 39 days, we go from 157 to 519. We go from 0.02 to 0.2. Then we go from",

We go from 0.02 to 0.2. Then we go from 0.31 to 2.42 and then the big jump. When we go from 39 into 1. So what I'm showing you, which is exactly what the Greeks tell us, is how these options are going to behave. So these 1 DTE options are going to have Delta's that comprise a massive amount of the premium of the option. These are 30 Delta's across the board. But because every option is in the process of making that very big choice, Delta is huge. And therefore Gamma is also huge because Gamma measures the rate of change of Delta, Theta is probably one of the most dastardly things you are fighting if you're trying to buy zero DTE options because they're cheap because you can be correct, but still lose money because you can't outrun this Theta. And the fun fact is Theta is not linear throughout the day. Theta will have different pockets in the beginning of the day when you see all that volatility and that volatility contracts. Theta is going to be more aggressive. Then it's going to be kind of slow and steady a lot of the day and at the end of the day it's going to be",

So if you don't understand these concepts, it will be very difficult, especially of a small account because this is super unforgiving if you're just throwing money out there hoping that this is going to work. So now that we have an idea of what zero DTE options are, how they behave, let's now talk about some ways to think about approaching it. But the first step I want to take between that is to actually show you plots of these. So if we take a look, I showed you that table. I purposely didn't put it in the form of a graph because you don't need that. You can see the data there, but for those that are more visual, here are some graphs. This isn't plotting zero DTE. This is just using long dated shorter dated, but this is just showing you the relationship of delta to date's expiration. You can see how this slope starts to get really aggressive and this is just going to get more and more aggressive as you get closer to expiration. Gamma has a really tall peak.

Then we can see Vega is what it is here. Vega on really short term options isn't really that big of an impact. It's because there's so little extrinsic value. Let's spend a couple minutes talking about how to trade these in a small account. The very first thing to keep in mind is my typical approach is being on the sell side. The reason is pretty transparent. If you take a look at what we just talked about, that's not to say that you can't make money buying, but it's very, very difficult and the cards are absolutely stacked against you. You have to be super good in terms of your directional picking, which is very difficult to do in that time frame as we talked about earlier. The main profit mechanism that we're trying to capture with zero DT options is variance risk premium. This is the propensity for implied volatility to be higher than realize volatility.

You will generally capture that variance risk premium, but it's not going to be as efficient as it could be if you're able to feature match and find some filters to apply. That's the secret sauce that goes into building a high performing zero DT strategy. There's different signals you can apply to try to measure this. Now, a super basic one is plotting implied volatility over realize volatility. That's a way to get you started because we know some of the primary traits, things like volatility clusters and so on and so forth. But you can use that as a starting point for your research, especially for the pro community. We spend a lot of time getting into the nuance here because that's where things really get interesting, but this is plenty to start with without a doubt.

And then you don't even get a chance to actually test the strategy. So the way to find that balance is to figure out what the max loss would be based on the structure you select if it's a short iron condor. And then you have to project out not losing once twice three times. You have to project out losing six, 10, 15 times, depending on what delta is you ultimately select. And you have to be sure that your strategy is able to endure those so that this way, you don't get stopped out in the middle of your strategy. This is all about developing a sound process. And then slowly refining it over time. This is not a way that's going to make you a ton of money super fast. This is not what it is. The cool part about zero DTEs, especially from my approach, is that they do allow you to tap into a less correlated return source. The intraday moves still matter, but you're really trying to take a sampling of vol and you're trading that more",

    "text": "This is not what it is. The cool part about zero DTEs, especially from my approach, is that they do allow you to tap into a less correlated return source. The intraday moves still matter, but you're really trying to take a sampling of vol and you're trading that more specifically. So you might have the rest of your portfolio scattered across all these different expressions. The market can be going down. Those positions might not be doing well, but then this can perform just fine in that kind of context. So it gives you another return source. Again, really important to pay attention to the total fees that you're paying because it gets expensive. That liquidity can dry up so poorly at the end of the day. So if you're trying to run stops, you can get mutilated by that. You have to be super careful. And then as I mentioned before, making sure for me, using European style options so that I'm not worrying about taking something into expiration and coming up with inventory that I don't want. This is a brief overview on how a small account can rationally attempt to trade zero DTE options. If you have any questions, let me know. Be an outlier. See you later.",
