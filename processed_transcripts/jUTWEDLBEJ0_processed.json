I just can't imagine that this many people actually think that this thing is worth anywhere close to this. And I mean, it's already plummeted essentially in half, right? It was Saturday in the afternoon at 1,300, 73 bucks. And as of Sunday, 15, 45, 40. So this thing's getting the altcoin treatment. This is just, yeah, fucking crazy to me. So the memories when I bring it up is I think people should at least be aware of this, not necessarily to have a strong opinion or to try and trade them and that kind of stuff. But this kind of thing is interesting. And it's interesting because it shows investor behavior. It shows trader behavior. It shows what FOMO looks like. It shows a lot of things about markets. And this is putting something that we talk about pretty regularly on full display that markets are not always rational. And more over all of that, it also means that there are a lot of people that made a lot of fucking money from this thing so far. That's the other reality.

But just set that side for a moment and understand a very important market concept that you have to be aware of in totality. People make money trading movement. You need movement. If you see movement like this, people some are making a lot of fucking money. There's people making a lot of money in this right now. So that's another thing to keep in the back of your mind because when you're trading things like options, for example, there are things that you can trade options on like biotech stocks that are not all too dissimilar to something like this that are just super, super erratic, super, super volatile. And you can make money trading them. Now again, I already made it clear, I've nothing in this. So I have no dog in this fight. But this is not something to just scoff at and think, oh, Trump coin, that's ridiculous.

There's the emission schedule. And then they're mostly up front supposedly unlocking primary liquidity provision, which is interesting. It's a little bit like that whole hawk to a coin thing. The coin world is so fucking curious. And if you're an options trader, you have to look at the coin world. The reason why you have to look at the coin world is this coin stuff is kind of like when options were first being brought and rolled out more broadly.

So this one doesn't seem to be moving quite the same. I mean, obviously it went from 0, 0, 4, 4, 9, peeking at 0, 4, 5. Again, it's the same thing. It's that volatility. There are people that are caching in big time on that volatility. And let's see this one really quick. America's comeback lady on ETH. This is crazy. What the fuck? The meme coin is a cryptocurrency project based created solely for satirical and humorous purposes, not affiliated with, sponsored by Melania Trump in any way. Oh, that's interesting.

    "text": "just classic to me. So I used to do YouTube shorts. And then I stopped just because they weren't really doing anything. And I don't know, I didn't really care. And then I started doing TikToks just a couple months ago. And the reason why I started doing TikToks is because I thought, you know, new audience, probably not a bunch of traders over there might be a good place to, you know, connect audiences a little bit. And that that kind of thing. So I started making TikToks. And then I start finding out all this stuff about the ban. And I was just like, oh, fuck, of course, that's just my luck. Start something on a platform and then it just gets taken down. But they, they put it back up today. So earlier today, you couldn't log on. Then midday, I noticed that you could log on, but you couldn't post or I couldn't post at least, maybe because of a peasant account. And then this afternoon or towards evening, I guess, I don't know, it's five. So it's like late afternoon. I looked again and it said something about like working with President Trump or whatever. And they've restored connectivity for TikTok. So I thought that was really interesting. BDs will says the guy that imposed the ban back in 2020 is now bringing it back so weird. Yeah, it's, well, I think if, if I'm not mistaken, we'll take a look. We don't have to",

All right. I think that's great. Tiktok began restoring service to users in the US following a temporary and voluntary shutdown that lasted less than a day. The company said Sunday that it was in the process of reinstating access after President elect Donald Trump vowed to try and pause the ban by executive order on his first day in the office. We think President Trump for providing necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok. So over 170 million Americans that had a TikTok side in the statement. It's a strong stand for the first amendment and arbitrary censorship. So I'm very curious though where they're going to land because of this is the main, this is the main problem is far as the government is being involved. They're saying we don't like that it's owned",

They're saying we don't like that it's owned by a Chinese company because the other thing that I have learned about TikTok is that there are different versions and the US version is a hell of a lot different than the Chinese version which that's noteworthy. It's not purely surprising that there would be different versions for those that don't know just about everything is different in different places to try and tailor to that culture. A great example of this is Disney. If you go to Disney in the US, you'll get the US Disney experience. They tried when they first made Disney over in Japan, which were they were so excited about Disney in Japan. They spent tons in tons of money researching, finding where they're going to build in the perfect spot, erecting Disney and they launched it and it was a massive failure. Why was it a massive failure? Because they launched it and they tailored it to what they expected the Japanese culture to want and funny enough for Disney. They didn't fucking want that. They wanted the American experience. So then they revamped all of Disney in Japan and then it ended up being a massive success. The point is the default",

The point is the default for companies is when you're rolling things out in different countries, you try and tailor whatever it is to the individual country that you're in because there are different cultures, subcultures, elements and artifacts of the way that they do things that you can connect more effectively. The fact that there's a difference between US TikTok and China TikTok, that's not all insanely surprising to me. But if you look at the kind of materials that are being moved through the algorithm, whether it's the actual people that are supporting it or if there's a back end process that's ghost handing it along, that's another question because we've seen that even with domestic-based social media companies where we know for a fact that they have a pretty significant hand in the processing of algorithms and what has bigger reach than other stuff. So a lot of really interesting intricacies behind this. And it says TikTok said a sale wasn't possible and challenged the long court, but it was rejected by unanimous Supreme Court on Friday.

Further, he said there would be no liability for companies that helped keep TikTok from going dark before the order went into effect. Americans deserve to see our exciting inauguration on Mondays, as well as other events. I would like the US to have 50 ownership position in a joint venture by doing this. We save TikTok, keep it in good hands and allow it to stay up. Without US approval, there is no TikTok. With our approval, it's worth hundreds of billions of dollars, maybe trillions. This is one of the cool aspects of the way Trump does things is a lot of it are seemingly just standard deal making, but these are the kind of things that you don't really see happen that much. And it's because there's a ton of other competing interests. But the idea of having shared ownership alleviates a lot of those concerns, I think at least, but we'll have to see.

So the court decision said in the investor ban does not violate the free speech rights of TikTok or its users, agreeing with the government position that the platform could be used by China to collect vast amounts of sensitive information on Americans. This doesn't fall on deaf ears, but this also begs the question, what kind of information is being collected then? And why is it so sensitive in the hands of China's compared to US corporations or whatever? Maybe we don't necessarily need to collect that amount of information. That's all theoretical shit. Don't have to get into it. To me, this just begs a couple of follow on questions as all. And let's see, Biden administration said enforcement of the law would be left to the incoming Trump administration, the company itself, the company took itself offline shortly before Sunday's midnight deadline. Users in the US open up the app late Saturday night were greeted with the message, sorry, TikTok isn't available right now. Yeah, okay. Okay, here we go. Even if Trump declines to enforce the ban, the law would still be on the books and companies like Apple and Google could be penalized on the road for violations.

I honestly don't know much about it, so I can't comment intelligently, but if that's the case, interesting, it is per usual. There's pockets of stuff like that that seemingly don't fully drive or make complete sense. There is. Cool. Off we go on this. All right, let's talk about options. One of the recent posts that came across, actually, I'm going to grab that post again because I want to get rid of my comment first. I don't want you to see my comment prematurely. Let me move this over here and give me a second. Okay, cool. I just don't want you to be skewed by what I'm talking about here. Now, for everybody that was in the newsletter, you will see this down at the bottom. I went through essentially all of this and explained some of the elements, which is cool. I want you to be able to come up with your",

I want you to be able to come up with your own conclusions and stuff, but I also want to spend a little bit doing it live with you so that we can go a little further into detail. The post was, do you use black sholes for actual trading? They say, I see some people posting about conference presentations on vol surface and whatnot. I've wanted to get surface models to see if there's any real advantage of knowing the surface patterns beyond just looking at 2D charts. I'm thinking you need to use black sholes to represent the theoretical 3D surface and also real-time data to map and compare. Do any of you actually do this in as there any point? Let's start with what this is and what we're talking about. For those that don't know, the black sholes, Martin model, and that's another thing that is always slightly annoying. It's not like a big deal, but Martin is on BSM is, Martin, black sholes, Martin, everybody just does black sholes. The reason why people do black sholes is because black sholes brought the model first and then Martin added to it, but Martin's inclusions were literally super important for the model actually working.

There are three people that worked on the model. Again, a random thing to know. Before I go any further, I want you to spend 60 seconds. I want you to genuinely think about, write it out.

I might have to stay away from the street tomorrow because now that I put this out in the ether, that would be bad. And yeah, the whole bus thing. Anyways, let's highlight before I show you, before I show you my answer, let's highlight a few things. First thing, hosting about conference presentations on wall surface. Why conference presentations? Why does that matter? Well, it matters because they're taking it as professional approach. They're taking it as people are going to informed conferences and talking about a wall surface. So then we start to think that's what we should be doing. That's the inference there. I wanted to get surface models and see if there's any real advantage of knowing surface patterns beyond looking at simple 2D charts. The surface is just a way to visualize things. And I will show you an example. If we go here in Qs and we can combine them, but if I plot this here is a volatility surface.

It's 2D, but it gives you all of the details from a three-dimensional plot. It's just not as aesthetic. So what ends up happening with a volatility surface is rather than having multiple lines like this that represent the different explorations. The multiple lines are built into the model, so then it presents itself more so as an actual 3D surface. But this provides you all of the same inputs that a 3D surface is. So the very first thing is their focus on simple 2D charts compared to 3D. There's fucking no magic there. There's literally zero magic there. The only difference is how it looks. You can see things a little bit differently for sure, but you can still see pretty much everything you want to see on something like this. Now this can look really noisy. It definitely is. So then we can look at averages. We can look at things like out of the monies. We can get rid of certain explorations. Maybe we focus on a front expiration and then the next primary explorations and see what that looks like. Interesting. The 21 Jan exploration looks fucking psychotic compared to these others.

There's no, I need to figure out where I get the 2D versus 3D you make your own. There's no magic to this. The difference is and this is part of their fundamental, fundamental misunderstanding of how this thing works. So the first thing when we think about a 3D model is we have days to expiration, different durations. So that's your first axis. Your second axis once we click into one of these is going to be your strike price. Your third axis is going to be the actual volatility at that intersection. So we're connecting all those points together. We need to figure out if it's a call or put, you can plot them all again.

Like I was showing you in the bottom of that other tool, you can plot them all as the same. It doesn't matter. You can just use the averages, the out of the monies, the end the monies, whatever you're trying to actually look at. But there are essentially those key elements that we're trying to plot. And that's what we're trying to visualize. And again, it's literally the same thing that they show you here. They show you strike price. They show you volatility, which is this axis. And then they just use different lines for different explorations, different durations. That's all. So if you want to create your own, all you do is first start with a graph. How do we build this graph? Easy. We start with days to expiration. Then we add a column for strikes. Then we add a column for vol. So then we go through and we fill this in. We say there's five days to expiration. And we're going to look at whatever is at the money plus a handful that are out of the money, lower strikes. Well, I'm not going to use money in this. We're going to pick whatever strike is at the money. And then we're just going to take a number off of that. So in",

No, markets are consensus driven. Second, there's nothing you could do with black shows unless you are creating your own plot of volatility. That's better than the market plot.

So their interest is really good. They're looking at the right things. Unfortunately, we already know the answer to what they're going to find, which is nothing. You're not going to get anything out of using the black shows, Martin model. You're not going to get anything out of using any other pricing model because the only way to use anything like this to derive an actual edge is if you are pricing the volatility input more accurately than everybody else. That's it. So back to this. Let's take a look at the response. We already talked about this, essentially saying that black shows, Martin, is a way to calculate a premium using the volatility of an option. The volatility surface simply is a plot that shows you the implied volatility across different strikes and expressions. So if you visualize a surface, if I take the options chain that we were just looking at together, plot out all of the volatility that we find.

So plotting, the process of plotting or visualizing of volatility surface provides you precisely zero edge. You get zero edge. It's just a way to visualize stuff. What I want to highlight to is this is something that retail traders do all the time. Retail traders go through the process of learning and they feel once they've learned something that they're now entitled to some sort of output from that learning. If I know what a volatility surface is now I should be able to extract an edge from that. I put in the effort to learn the volatility surface. It's not how markets work. It's not calibrated based on the effort you think you put in. That's one of the beautiful things about markets. It's completely indifferent to you. So there's absolutely no edge in just visualizing the surface. So going through the process of plotting a surface can be really useful, just like I showed you we came across an example where there might be something found.

So then anyways, we go down this thread a little bit more and there's a comment here. So this they then come and say yeah I haven't really delved into how it can be used. So I can tell right from the beginning there's a slight defensive element to the way that they're framing, but that's okay. But yeah, IV is an input for BS, but BSM, but it's calculated backwards from the actual premiums paid in actuality. What they're trying to say is you can use Black Sholes-Martin model to derive the derivative. It's a differential equation. You can derive components from it, so you can derive out what volatility is being priced at. But guess what your platform will do that for you. It's automatically going to do it for you because that's a base function. So what that means is the way that we're arriving at this implied volatility surface percentiles here, this isn't TD Ameritrade that's saying throwing their surface model out there and saying based",

They're not doing that. They're taking the current price and then they're deriving out the volatility based on the other inputs which are known. We know that this is 33 days of expiration. We know that this is a 520 strike. We know that this is a call. We know what the dividend is. We know what the risk-free rate is, so on and so forth. So we can take, it's just a basic differential equation. We can take elements out of it to isolate components. So that's what's happening here. And that's what your platform is already doing for you. So then it says, I'm just curious to know if there's any point to look at it. And again, they're confused with what they're looking at. Like, is there a point in looking at the volatility surface? Sure. Again, you can come across ideas in there, but there's no edge baked in.

So if there's a mismatch input call parity that you are seeing with your eyes as a retail trader, there's probably a reason for it because the on the overwhelming majority of instances, there's going to be high frequency trading algorithms that are going to see that light years, light years before you ever see it.

Now, depending on how far away the context of the ball going in the hoop, you get different amount of points. That being said, just because I know if I put the ball in the hoop, I get points. It doesn't mean that I get points. Still have to put the fucking ball in the hoop. I still have to do the thing that I understand.

Yeah, they're still confused. 10 years options trading have no interest in black Shoals whatsoever. That's not a good thing.

James says, what's your opinion on far out of the money put credit spreads like 5 chance of expiring and the money looks like 25 annually is reasonable with these trades. That sounds like smoking crack to me. If you can show me where you're seeing that, we can talk about it specifically. But no, I mean, think of, again, think of what you're saying. If I'm trading futures, that's okay. We can look at futures. Tell me, tell me which one you're looking at options on futures. My guess is you might be actually mispricing options on futures. They're priced differently. So you're probably going to be grossly sad when you go to enter the actual trade you're looking at.

And while you're doing that for the rest of the folks, this is a, it's just a good reminder on why it's really important to always keep in mind the context of what we're trying to do.

Let me pop the door for a door real quick. I'll be right back. The next one is the expiration. It's about three to five percent probably of expiring in the money. What expiration though?

The multiplier on futures, on options on futures or futures options, depending on how you want to phrase it, is different, not 100. So the, and that's exactly if you remember, before we started doing this exercise, that's the exact thing I said is going on here is your misunderstanding what the multiplier is. The multiplier on MES is what? Not 10. What's the multiplier on MES? Five. No, it's not 50. The multiplier on SPX or ES, not SPX, ES is 50. The multiplier here is five. So what happens if I go again into this, this option right here, and I go to sell, how much am I going to get? Let's think peak. Let me make sure that nothing else is in here. Yep, okay. So my max profit here, 14.25. Hella different than 305, isn't it? Hella different. Or even if I move this to 305 to give us the midpoint, 305, 1525. So what's going on here? Where's the money? Is the multiplier is different. The multiplier on options futures, James says, no, I mean like you risk half your accounts",

So let's pretend instead of MES, let's pretend that you're trading spy. And it's just because that has 100 multiplier. If I'm trading spy with 100 multiplier and I'm using weekly options and I go to the five, five percent here. If I sell this, I'm making 26 bucks. And then if I buy this to spread it off, it's three pennies. Is what I'm getting. If I do this in forward slash MES, the same scenario, because we're spreading it off, it won't look all too dissimilar. But it will be different still. So this is sell this, buy this. And in this trade, your max profit is 75 cents. You see the difference. In the other trade, you at least made 3. In this trade, if you spread it off, you're making 75 cents. So, again, depending on what size account you think you're trading, it doesn't matter like half the account is arbitrary. Right. We're just saying half the account that doesn't really mean anything.

So on the account, we would make 14.25 divided by the account value, which is 2,000. As a percentage, it's 0.71 per week. So if we make, where's my other here we go? Weekly is .07. If you take, I'm sorry, .7, I'm bad. So .7 per cent weekly would represent a 43.7 per cent annual return. If you do this every week, 43.7. So as I tell you, just applying common sense. And then we'll explain why the whole there, James says, IDK is it wrong? Let's not wrong. It is what it is. But the risk exactly, the second, your last comment is exactly what it is. It's bogus. It's bogus in terms of it's not going to work well. And let's talk about why it won't work well. If we have this gain, sorry, let me fix this. If we have this loss against this size, guess what that means? One losing trade wipes out 32 winners. That's not including fees. That's not including commissions.

We can look at pricing as it's today based on we can adjust it by volatility or something like that.

So then in this case, let's figure out what that is. 58N. So it'd have to go to 58N. Is that worth the... Let's zoom this in. So with MES trading right now at 6026, 58N is about right here. And if you'll notice, 58N is well within a potential large move. It's smaller. It's outside the expected move. But it doesn't require a massive move in order to hit that. And it's because we're so close in time. So James says, but we can split these up due three or four trades a day. So we risk 2 of the account on each trade. Yeah, the",

One of those notes is we're even pretending as if the liquidity would remain there for you to do this, which it won't. So granting that element, which I have to show you, the overall the overall open interest for both of these, the 518 and then the 510 is 0 and 11. So the first thing that tells you is that you're looking at something that's illiquid. That then becomes exacerbated during a down move. That's also exacerbated by the fact that you have two legs, both the short and then the long. And then the other problem you're going to face with something like this is when you're trying to roll a vertical. Rolling of vertical is essentially not going to happen. And that's general parlance. It could occur. But the probability of actually getting a well-priced roll on a vertical enough to actually help the vertical is about null. So there's serious practical application downfalls, unfortunately, to it. But without going into any of those, the primary issue that you're going to face is that this is a negatively expected strategy and that it would require a much more nuanced approach if we're to",

    "text": "the vertical is about null. So there's serious practical application downfalls, unfortunately, to it. But without going into any of those, the primary issue that you're going to face is that this is a negatively expected strategy and that it would require a much more nuanced approach if we're to hope to make any sort of money on this. But in its current form, yeah, like this is no good, unfortunately. James says I had a massive losing trade on a zero and I was able to roll out 90, 90 to instill one. So I know the max loss doesn't always happen. No, it doesn't necessarily have to always happen. But you're one scenario of rolling a zero DTE trade that was losing out to nine doesn't help you either. What that ends up doing, especially for something like this, that you're trying to rely on a statistical probability, right? A high probability trade, 95 is you now starting to wrap up a bunch of money into losing trades and rolling them out for nine times the duration of the original trade. That starts to compound in an ugly way really fast. And yeah, like that's its own can of worms that will be problematic for you. So yeah, I mean, the cliff notes version is this is the same thing. The Saint-The-Hackelberry. This can win a whole bunch of times, but the very few times that it does experience a loss, it's going to overtake 32 wins whenever",

This can win a whole bunch of times, but the very few times that it does experience a loss, it's going to overtake 32 wins whenever that does happen. Even if you choose to roll it, and then it continues to fall further in the money, one of the problems that you'll have is the further something goes in the money. If it continues to move against you in a sustained move, then rolling becomes even more, more difficult. And then you actually end up booking a loss on the full trade and you will have a compounded loss, which is not good. So yeah, bad news bears, as far as I could tell, thanks for bringing it up though, as you know, love looking at this stuff, hope to help the whole point is to try to save people money from from burning money on stuff like this. So yeah, good job bringing it up. All right, gang, time to go eat some dinner. I'm out of here, being outlier. I'll see you later.",
