There was nobody to teach it to me. So this is stuff that I've learned over the last decade and a half of focusing on finance incredibly hard after being introduced to the concept of investing by a high school teacher. If it wasn't for that dude, my path would have been completely different. And I want to be abundantly clear. I really am nobody special. I'm not the smartest guy in the group, not the dumbest guy in the group, very average across the board. So the main goal for this video is to walk you through the exact roadmap I used to become a millionaire in my late 20s. And it sounds kind of crazy. But once you start looking at some of this stuff in a different way, you realize that it's quite possible. And no, it's not being anything like this guy. I don't know anything about this. I literally just looked up on Google finance guru jet. And this is what pops up. But we have a dude that I guess was a finance influencer that went bankrupt. It's none of this. You're not going to see me hopping on fake jets or I guess they have this thing in L.A. Where you just go take pictures on a fake jet stage, which is",

Where you just go take pictures on a fake jet stage, which is also fascinating. You're wasting money. It's more so actually about this. How I went from walking through metal detectors every day to go to high school, working around lots of different people with different motivations in their life, a lot of them gang banging and dealing drugs. And I decided I didn't want to do that, but I didn't know what to do. So I was working a lot of different odd jobs as a young dude in high school, junior high school, but then teacher introduced me to investing. And that introduction sent me down a completely different path. It's how when we were recently in Alaska, we got to do a last minute decision to rent a private helicopter and go fly around. Go check out glaciers. How we get to go travel around Norway. So I get to have fun cars and build them because no, I'm not just by cool looking cars because I think people will like me. Nobody will like me anyways. It's just because I like cars. I like to work on them. I like to go diving. I like to go to Africa. I like to experience life. So I went from",

What that means is through my application of the trading skill set, I was able to rapidly accelerate my time frame. The reality is trading is not for a lot of people. So this overall base case is going to talk about a generally applicable approach for most people that's feasible, not banking on somebody being good at trading or maybe being able to land this really high paying job. It's a little bit more of a middle ground. So let's take a look at this together. The first thing I want to start with, what are the probabilities here? You most of you know from my channel. I am a statistics minded person and I want to know the probabilities of things. So if we take a look across the US, there's about 9.2 millionaires. That's not high, but that's not a bismillial low.

We're talking about a difficult benchmark to hit, but this isn't insanely difficult. Because if you imagine the way most people go through their lives, they clearly will probably not land anywhere near this because they're too busy using self-wealth depletion habits to deplete their wealth as compared to build it. So no shock here. Then we also see that the average age of a millionaire is 61. And if we look at the average retirement age, it's later in this same period of time, 60s. So that doesn't sound super great to me because the idea is to try and create this wealth earlier so that you have more freedom. You have more autonomy. But I try to tell people is that money in no way will make you happy. But if you were happy before money, money is a massive accelerator. It is just a huge value ad. So if you're looking at becoming a millionaire thinking making a bunch of money, then you'll become happy. You won't. It's not how it works.

We have investing and we have income. Why do we start with this? Well, the reason why we start with savings is because you need something to invest, right? So you can't just save your way to wealth. Eric, what do you mean? That's crazy. You're supposed to save. Of course, you're supposed to save. But let me show you an example is to why you cannot save your way to wealth. If we take a look at this compound growth calculator over here, you'll notice a few things. I'll slide it over a little bit more. You'll notice a few things. The first thing is if we look at 5,000 and we look at over a 30 year time frame, I'm going to turn this rate of return down to zero. And I'm going to say that we're really good savers.

Same thing, starting 5 grand, saving 500 a month, 30 year time frame. Instead, let's add a generally average market return of 10. What happens? Whoa, now you're a millionaire. This right here is what made you a millionaire versus a sub 200,000 air. There is no saving your way to wealth. You have to invest. Full stop. Period. You have to invest. Okay, let's talk about some of these friction points with respect to investing. We already know we can't save our way to wealth. We need to save super aggressively. We know that we need to invest and we know that income is going to be an important point simply because it's here. We haven't talked about it yet, but we will.

There's all these different reasons to delay beginning this process. And the only thing this does is delay the outcome. Just start. You have 25 bucks. Start there. Start adding 25 to your investing account monthly, no matter what. Just do it every single month into perpetuity. It's a starting point. Our focusing on is actually building a habit. Once the habit is built and you see the value, it becomes easier to embrace delayed gratification and then instead of spending that 100 to go out with your friends, you think, okay, well, I don't have to go out, you know, three times this week. I can go out twice with my friends this week. I can balance trade offs. Go out twice, sacrifice the third, save the money that I would have spent on the third and feed this machine. That's the entire idea in the beginning. But once we start, we don't stop. We have a bad month. Doesn't matter. You still put in your minimum. 25 bucks, 50 bucks, whatever you define, compliance is non-negotiable. Has to happen. Then we have this idea of building a vision. Why does",

Because it helps us contextualize the trade offs that we're going to have to make. So when we think about this idea of trying to expand our income, one of the biggest errors people make is if you're making a good salary, you're making 100,000 a year, whatever it is, and you're saving. And then you get a pay bump, right? Now you're making 120,000 a year. You did a good job. You got a great pay bump. The problem is most people spend that 20,000. They expand their lifestyle to fit their new income level. Yes, what we just wasted, perfectly good money that could have been put into our savings rate to accelerate this clock from 30 years. We can cut this way down if we're smart. So let's take a look. If instead we do this 500 a month, let's take a look if we do 750 a month on average. 30 years, you have a million dollars at the 500 bucks. At 750, you have 1.6 million. So now instead of hitting that millionaire threshold in year 30, you actually cross it in year 26. You've cut four years off of this",

    "text": "if we do 750 a month on average. 30 years, you have a million dollars at the 500 bucks. At 750, you have 1.6 million. So now instead of hitting that millionaire threshold in year 30, you actually cross it in year 26. You've cut four years off of this timeline by saving an additional 250 per month. This just accelerates more and more from there. The only way this continues to accelerate is that if you establish a lifestyle that you're comfortable with and then as you find ways to make more money, you do not grow your lifestyle. You keep your lifestyle the same and you funnel this new gap here into your investing account. That's it. That's how this clock goes further and further to the left. And if we take a look, that is the entire premise here behind slow as fast because a lot of people really struggle to see the utility of saving 100 a month. It can be very difficult to actually picture how impactful saving just 100 a month can be. So then you forego doing it and you do it again and again and again. The problem is that money builds over time. Small amounts of money still compound. I just showed you a scenario where if you saved an extra 250 a month, you essentially add 600,000 into your net worth picture at the end of this timeframe. So you have to appreciate the small steps because they matter. So",

Maintain your lifestyle, start investing right away, dollar cost average every single month. Don't skip a month. I have a blog post that I'll link to below that walks through this. How to start investing if you know nothing. I'll throw a link to that below. You can read through it. It's literally step by step. It'll get you started in less than 30 minutes. Then expand your income. You have to make some decisions. Are you working at a high earning career field? We're working for the next promotion. Make sense. Working with industry. Maybe you actually don't get comfortable at your current job because it's comfortable cushy. You know what to do. It's a routine. And maybe you're actually aggressively moving every two to three years because guess what? If you work at a place and they give you a standard three 5 pay increase, that doesn't really matter that much. Especially if you look at people who jump jobs every two to three years, they tend to get a 10 plus pay increase. Easy. Some of them can be 25 plus. So there's no",

So there's no catching up with that staying at the same place. You have to be really strategic or you can do like I did. Which is start hustling. When I was in high school, I used to split wood for a guy that I hunted on his property. I used to move shale for him. I used to sell Christmas trees. I used to take people's trash out literally. I used to shovel people's walkways and their driveways when it's snowing. Then in college, I got into flipping cars. I would buy broken cars, fix them, sell them, same thing with motorcycles. I kept doing that all the way through my time in the Marine Corps. You have to get scrappy. But the idea is if you build a vision that then you truly can see yourself what life would look like with this amount of money, it starts to make you want to save more money. So then it's not 30 years. So that if you start taking these slow steps early, this will speed things up massively. So even though it is delayed gratification, we're talking about multi-year periods, the more you delay gratification, the faster you end up getting",
