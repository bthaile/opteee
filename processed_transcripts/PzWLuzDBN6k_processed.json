    "text": "there's 295,000 calls 100,000 106,000 puts 23 OG is 41,000 to 11,000 30 OG is 37 to 10 six step wow that's actually really surprising it's 12 to two so just super quiet super super quiet um 13 step 4,800 to 2 2600 and then 20 step 49 to 27 so overall the front expiration as pre usual with GameStop is the busy spot but it does look like very quiet after this expiration cycle so really what this means for me is I still have my shares I'll just keep holding those but when it comes to trading options or playing options I'm selling calls against the shares because we're just trending sideways and that helps support the position a bit and there's still good IV in the product overall so if we take a look at the out of the monies we take a look at the VA you can still see like there's really decent out of the money call volume uh volatility sorry so this is still heavily appealing to me from an option selling perspective to take something against the long shares because again the long Shares are just kind of grinding sideways they're not really doing anything super fun to look at so that is that as always if there's any questions let me know the outlier Pros we have a live stream later today and then the gme live stream will be this coming Saturday Newton we don't know if he's going to",
