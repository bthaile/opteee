We've set up this really cool quarterly cadence. And I was actually explaining to him just like it is on the last video. It's really cool to kind of get a download of what you're seeing right now, get an idea of how different up and coming have impacted what you're seeing and your projections. So there's a lot to talk about. Obviously, as per usual, I mean, I started a YouTube channel like the perfect time because there's no shortage of drama almost every single time I connected to you. So before that, though, as always, welcome back. Thank you for joining us. Yeah, thanks Eric. Thanks for having me back. Yeah, I'm looking forward. There's a handful of things that I'm really excited to talk about. I want to talk a little bit about 2022. Then I obviously want to talk about 2023 and looking forward from there. But to kick us off keeping it in a general logical order, looking back at 2022, what were some of the major economic themes that stood out to you? Yeah, for sure. The Fed was a dominant story. And before that, Ukraine, I think we came into the 2022. I had expected a correction and then a quick return to new highs, maybe spend a quarter in correction and then go. But then",

I had expected a correction and then a quick return to new highs, maybe spend a quarter in correction and then go. But then Ukraine hit and changed the whole landscape, it drove oil through the roof and it caused inflation to spike. From there, as we say, the Fed took over. So those were probably the dominant things. And we're still dealing with both, obviously coming into this year. The difference is the Fed, the Fed hike aggressively faster than we've ever seen them hike. The rate increases that we saw both from the Fed and in the bond market were the fastest on record. And it's not so much the level of rates, but the speed of that hike or the speed of that rise in rates that really has hit the economy. And as I think when I hit it very hard as we move through this year. So it's easy to get caught in historic numbers and say, the interest rates are 4.5 big deal. When we've been at double digits, we've been at 7 or 8, we've been a lot higher than this even not that many years ago. But it's that rapid rise from almost 0 rates to where we're heading for 5.

It just doesn't get there all at once. So if you're looking at that and saying, well, we're not seeing the damage, we don't think it's so bad. I think they're going to be very surprised that all of a sudden they're going to see the damage. It's too late. It's interesting that you talk about seeing the damage. The recent PPI figures came out and they were significantly lower than what most people were projecting something to the tune of like 1.2 below the recent forecast. Do you think that that's part of that coming to fruition where we've had this really aggressive cycle? And now we're starting to get to the back end where it's almost like the inverse where some of these metrics are just contracting so fast. And is that what's happening here? Or are you seeing something different? No, it is what's happening.

It finally, when it happened, it happened pretty quickly, but it took a while. I think you'll see the same thing in jobs and a lot of other parts of the economy is, yeah, it takes a while for Fed policy to work through the system and have its impact when you're financials. When you look at, we're just starting to see the credit deterioration in the banks. That's going to hit hard, I think, by the second half of this year. And, you know, again, the Fed's kind of looking at it months to months and saying, we're seeing deterioration, but it's not anything alarming and we're not worried about it yet.

Plus, if you look at, you know, I follow, obviously, commodity futures a lot. Look at what you're seeing as I said, gasoline, but look what you see in lumber prices. You know, it was 1700, a year and a half ago. And, you know, now it's down to 350 or whatever, 400. So, you know, those are huge drops. And we're seeing that we saw it in copper.

The thing is that you can probably assume going forward, not every month, baby, but going forward, you're going to have easier inflation numbers. So, that means if fed somewhere in here, you're going to wake up and say, I guess we did do our job or I guess it has impacted. But the problem is, at the same time, that's happening. The economy is getting impacted. And by the time they finally figure out the inflation has been beaten, they've already done tremendous damage to the economy. Leads me to a follow-on question. This is more of a personal one. I've noticed it with a handful of economic releases over the past two weeks or so, where the forecasts are whatever they are.

They have a pretty good handle on putting the indexes together and breaking apart and figuring out the various components. The problem is, you're getting to a point where you're, you know, I call it an inflection point, but you're at a point where things are starting to break down.

And some of its seasonal adjustment factors, you know, that stuff is, I just don't pay attention to monthly numbers like that, particularly not jobs because you do see these, you know, all of a sudden, once a year or whatever they they find this big error and they adjust it. So, you know, the fence actually managing policy by monthly numbers, basically, you know, looking at data monthly, when that data we know, all of a sudden, either can all of a sudden change, or you're going to find that data you're relying on, needed to be, you know, was recalculated and found out it was way off. So, from reality. So I'm not a big fan of managing monetary policy on a month to month databases, but that's, you know, when they say they're dead at the pendant, that's what they mean. So I'm, you know, much more focused as a strategist on trends, and knowing full well that I'm timing wise is going to take time, and I'm not going to be able precisely know, but, you know, that's, to me, trends are far more important than months and months data.

That was actually my guess, was that essentially there was some sort of typical scaling factor they were using, and then there's an acceleration essentially that occurs at some point that they kind of get caught with. So it's, it seems kind of in line with my general, my general guess. Another personal question that I have for you, I've talked to a handful of friends and whatnot. There's economists from all different walks of life, essentially. There's an interesting theme I noticed. Most of them don't actively trade. Some of them invest, but most of them seem to not actively trade. This could just be my small sample, but is there, why is that? Like, why am I even seeing that small sample trend? You're talking about economists generally or yeah. I think, you know, again, economists are understand that month to month is highly unpredictable. You know, they try to predict it, but they're, they also know themselves that, you know, they're not going to hit it right all the time. And I think so they're, they carry that over to the market where they think they're shorter, the horizon, the less predictability. That's my view.",

Unfortunately, retail investors come in and lots of official traders as well, thinking the most predictable is the shorter time frame. I'm quite the opposite, you know, that could be a longer time frame and I could tell you what I think is going to happen. I think it's because economists and strategists are looking at bigger picture. You know, it's, again, you know, that old saying about you can't see the forest for the trees. You know, the retail trade or the retail investors focused on the trees, the economists and the strategists focused on the, you know, the forest. Makes total sense. And again, my hypothesis where there was that you have to have a certain part of you that's at least partially unhinged to actively trade because of exactly that.

Are there any like longer term implications of this that me focusing on the trees I'm missing from the forest? I'm sorry. I'm primarily curious about Russia invading Ukraine. When it first happened, I was able to come up with a couple themes. I understand the natural gas aspect of things, the food aspect, those kinds of stuff, especially coming into the winter. But I'm wondering since this has been a pretty prolonged engagement, the market in my opinion probably is synthesized a lot of the implications of this. But I'm really curious about the longer term implications of Russia invading Ukraine from an economic standpoint. Yeah, it's a lot of it was just kind of early on.

One price has run up. People, people start using less of something. You know, so when gasoline prices went to five dollars, you know, driving became somewhat, you know, people were more careful with their driving. They weren't planning as long trips, etc. And, and the other thing that impacts it is the economy and if the feds overstaying, it's welcome on the tight side, the economy's getting weaker and, and I think is that's, you know, you know, I'm called for a global bust later this year. It's not that we're going to be fine until we get there. We're going to be in recession and then recession goes into global bust. I think that's true of the world.

You know, the world's demand for these items is being impacted by central banks who are focused on yesterday's problem. Yesterday's problem was inflation. I think tomorrow's problem is deflation and they haven't recognized it yet. Got it. And that actually touches kind of neatly on the next topic. The last few times we were talking, the general sentiment you were sharing was kind of this parabolic rise into a, you know, 80 plus global bust. And over the different times we've spoken, there's been different catalysts that have intervened and essentially just your analysis of that. So it sounds like that's still generally your forecast here. Is that right? And if so, can you just walk me through what you're seeing? Sure. Yeah. My view has not changed at all. I think we saw the end of the bear market on October 13th when, you know, the, you see, if I came out, the market went down below 3500 in the first hour and reverse quickly. And we haven't looked back since we, you know, we haven't seen 3500 since then. We, we ran up to 4000.

I mean, we've probably, you know, we've broken a little bit before we backed off. But I think the size of the graphic through it next week. And probably see 4,300 pretty quickly.

And I think that's what, you know, the first quarter and probably the first half of this year is going to be about is, you know, we spent much of 2022 with people reallocating away from equities, uh, becoming, you know, as they became more and more bearish.

You know, the down happened over nine months. The up happens over let's say three or four or five months. So it sounds like there's a couple primary catalysts that would drive this move for you. It seems like some of it is the inflation data continuing to show some cooling, which might put some wind in the market sales. It sounds like you were talking about, um, shifting of broader institutional capital from risk off into more risk on trying to catch the move.

So, so the 10 year got up to 430 and changed 435 or whatever it was. And is now, you know, down at 340 and was down at 335. So 100 base points lower. And the Fed's still talking about higher, higher rates. Well, I'll trust the bond market much more than I trust stock market. I much more than I trust Fed because in the aggregate, the bond market has a, a history of seeing the future. And, as I've said, it discounts the future.

Is it literally just that that they just don't want to change what they're messaging until it's exactly time to change? Because to me, that's the part I don't understand is the bond market is already showing us this. I know the Fed can see it, but they're still messaging something that's so far away from that. That's like the decoupling that I just, I can't understand. It's a number of things. First of all, they got burned, you know, Paul got burned by being late to the game.

You know, you're going to have stair steps along the way. You're going to have pullbacks along the way. But it does mean that all those people say, oh, 4,000 is high as you're going and you're going back to 3,000 or 3,200 or whatever. It means more likely, 4,000 is the beginning of something, take you like I said, the 4,346, maybe new highs. And where I think the real takeoff point comes and you may pull back from there, you know, for a while. But the real takeoff happens, I think. Once we make new highs in a decisive way, that's where you get that parabolic meltup. So, you know, those that want to believe that I'm saying from 4,000 to 6,000 is going to happen in 10 minutes or not. I don't know how that the shape of that is going to be. It's going to be, it's going to be fast. And I think steep and faster than we've seen in history, maybe. But that doesn't mean you can't have pullbacks along the way that last for, you know, weeks at a time. So, um, Anyway, yeah, it's, I think it's an important note. A lot of people, especially traders, were known for our patients. So as soon",

If we don't talk about precious metals, so I refuse to exit the conversation without asking your view on precious metals, which is actually, you know, kind of purposely place this way, one for just, but also because I've been trading gold quite a bit lately myself. And it just love your thoughts on that because the last few times you had a really interesting perspective on specifically gold, but yeah, what are your thoughts on precious metals as we sit now? Yeah, I'm, I'm very bullish on the metals. I think they, you know, they've led this year. I may not feel like at, uh, at times because they, you know, they were ran up and then they correct, but um, we're seeing the both gold is, is up at levels that we haven't seen for a while. And, and sovers, uh, you know, near 24. I think we are going to see a very strong next six months in the metals and, um, me, I'm continuing to call for 50",

I mean, I, I think that may be good enough, but it's possible given the move that I see coming in silver, gold could move even higher than that. So, um, I think we have a big move in the metals coming, um, part of it's the dollar, part of its lower interest rates, part, you know, a big part of that I think will be if you get, if you get the feeling the feds done tightening, that's the most bullish thing you can tell the metals market. You know, it's wind at your back instead of in your face. Um, and so I think that's all going to happen. The miners will be sympathetic for all ears with that with some big moves miners typically, you know, in a bull market in the metals, the miners will perform the metals. So, um, you know, you should have some pretty good moves in the, in, you know, gold miners and the silver miners as well. And by the way, is not",

Um, it's another reason why it's a little hard to be negative on the market, because, you know, if we were, if we were heading into, you know, the real dumps, copper would not be moving up like it is. So part of that is probably China reopening. No question, but I think, you know, I've been calling for 6 copper and I was saying that last year when it looked possible, copper was only going down, but I do think we're probably going to see 6 copper.
