Can you walk somebody through exactly how you manage a portfolio been less than 10 minutes? If the answer is no, it means that you're missing a lot of important details. So the goal of this video is to walk you through how I think about managing a portfolio. Now, right out of the gate, my approach has changed over the years that I've been trading. I started trading over 16 years ago now. So there are definitely some differences that I do now compared to where I start. So the point is, is it's an evolving process. But I want to walk you through looking back at that experience. What's worked well for me? And then at the end of the video, I want to walk you through exactly how I split out my portfolio and how I like to think about managing my risk. What's up, everybody? Eric here. Welcome back to all the outliers. Shout out to the Patreon family and the YouTube members. And with that, let's talk about how to manage a portfolio. So the very first thing is I really do believe this applies to everybody, whether you are a passive investor and active investor, there are points that you need to manage a portfolio. You have to touch and adjust your portfolio. And that's an important point because really the only thing that",

You have to touch and adjust your portfolio. And that's an important point because really the only thing that changes is the frequency and maybe what you track the depth of the information that you collect. But overall, even if you're a passive investor, there's going to be periods of time where you need to rebalance things. So regardless of how active you are, I think it's important to think about a reasonable time frame for you to manage your portfolio. So if you're active, it's obviously as active as you like to trade. If you're a passive investor, once a quarter, once every six months, once a year, something like that is probably completely fine. So let's talk about what we should be thinking about to start. I am a huge fan of Stephen Covey and the seven habits of highly successful people. And one of the things he talks about is begin with the end in mind. The reason why I think that's so important is because as we think about how we're going to manage a portfolio, what we're trying to accomplish needs to be integrated into those interactions when we're managing a portfolio. So what do I mean by that? What is the objective of your portfolio? Are you trying to aggressively grow your account",

So what do I mean by that? What is the objective of your portfolio? Are you trying to aggressively grow your account or are you trying to manage income so that you can have a secondary source of income? The reason why those two thing matters is depending on which one of those you're focused on, the way that you deploy your portfolio is going to vary widely based on that. So what I really think it's important to do is think about your long-term and short-term objectives and then quantify, quantify, quantify. That means if you say, I want to grow my account, that's not good enough. You're missing a ton of fidelity that's going to impact the way that you do everything. So if your goal is to grow your account by 1 per year versus 20 per year, the details that get you there are vastly different. And we take a lot of these things for granted. So when we're talking about what we're trying to do in the markets, whether it's talking about portfolio management or strategies, we have a lot of things baked into our thoughts if we say grow the account. Well, really we're inferring all of these other things, but you got to get into detail. Take the time and quantify what you're trying to",

So with those details quantified, here are the guiding principles I think about. Efficient and detailed. The more active you are, the more detailed this should be. And it's because the details matter, your number one job as a portfolio manager to lay it out front. Super simple is manage risk. You have to manage risk. That is your number one job. You cannot make money if there's no money to make money on. So whatever you are attempting to do, your profits are secondary. Your return target is secondary to risk management. That has to come number one, and it's got to be baked into what you're doing. So think about how you want to manage risk and think about how you want to track your risk management throughout the life cycle of your strategies. So with that, let's think about risk.

And I am almost 100 utilized, 98 utilized. And it's because there's a ton of opportunity right now with all the SVB bank failures. I have a ton of positions expiring today. My last story short, I had a high risk tolerance for today because I saw a tremendous amount of opportunity that might not always be the case. And it very frequently isn't. If you look at a lot of my live sessions back from 2022, a lot of my things were 20 utilized, 10 utilized. I had very low risk tolerance. And it's for different reasons. Sometimes it's because I was ahead of pace and I didn't need to have a lot of risk. It's because I didn't see a lot of opportunity and I wasn't looking to force trades. The reasons are limitless, but you need to define this. And you can define this in two ways.

Do I need to have more risk on or less risk on and still be on pace? So I think about how does my current tracking align with my overall long term, short term objectives from there. I like to think about and more importantly, what is my assessment of the market conditions? The reason why this is so important is because let's say I'm trailing behind in terms of my overall portfolio objectives. I'm not making enough money I need so far for the year, but I really am kind of risk off. And my overall market assessment is pretty bearish or negative, meaning I'm not sure what I want to put out. I don't want to run my short strategies for whatever reason. So I might just accept the fact that I could have a period of time where I'm running behind pace. And sometimes that is what it is.

And I'll walk through how I split out my portfolio in just a few minutes. But this idea of understanding your current desired risk is absolutely important. So now let's talk about how I break out portfolio management. And there's two levels I look at. We have the portfolio level. And then we have individual trades and strategies. So what I mean by this is when I'm looking at my overall portfolio, I'm looking at things like beta weighted deltas and does my overall risk align with what I want for my beta weighted deltas. I also think about things like are any of my current products too correlated. So that means if I have a bank of America trade on and a Wells Fargo trade on at the same time, but I'm not super stoked about financials like I am not right now, maybe having two of those positions on even if I like them",

Maybe I need to make a transition on one of those trades. So I'm going to look at the overall risk in terms of size that I have out. I'm going to look at the correlation between the products to make sure that I'm not becoming too centralized in terms of my risk profile. And I'm going to juxtapose all of that against my market hypothesis. This is the very first tier that I'm looking at from there. I'm going to look at each individual trade. So what is the risk in the trade and in terms of my risk metrics, have I hit them? Meaning if I have a mental stop set or if I have a resistance level set for a directional trade that is now becoming violated, I need to manage the risk in the trade. That's the very first thing that's listed here for trades and it's the very first thing that's listed here for the portfolio and it's for a reason.

I prioritize it and I emphasize it because that is what I need to do first. So when I'm looking at individual trades, have I met my risk management thresholds, which need to be predefined before you enter a trade. What I'm going to look at is it time to take profit. This is the more fun scenario, but maybe I need to just review and say, Hey, did I hit my max profit on this short put or did my ratio diagonal hit my profit target, which is validated by hitting x point that's predefined before entering the trade. Those kind of details matter quite a bit. Time I trade options. There's a time component to what I do. So is something expiring soon? If so, is it okay? Do I want to take it into expiration or do I need to manage it? Another aspect of time that doesn't just apply to options traders, but if you trade an equity, but earnings is coming up and you don't want to be exposed to earnings. Well, there you go. You need to do something about it and it's because of an event that's coming up. And then the last thing is the thesis",

You need to do something about it and it's because of an event that's coming up. And then the last thing is the thesis review. This really ties to time sort of, but if I put on a trade with a certain thesis, for example, if I wanted to trade XLF like I am right now and my thesis is bearish. And I'm looking at my position in XLF and I look at XLF and it's not doing what I thought it was going to do. I don't have to wait until my risk metric is hit or until my profit metric is hit. If my general hypothesis, if my thesis isn't happening, that's grounds to manage that position in and of itself. So there's a couple of the things that I tend to layer into this, but I think this is a good overview for most people on how I like to think about portfolio and individual trade management. Now I want to walk you through how I construct my portfolio and what the implications are. I have a core allocation and I have a speculative allocation.

I purposefully split my portfolio into these two pieces because it gives me a ton of clarity over where I have my money, what kind of trades I'm putting on where and it allows me to you guessed it, control my risk. So the way I think about my core positions is this is kind of my main bid for success. This is my main effort as we would say in the Marine Corps. So when I have my annual return targets, which is now around 12 per year, it used to be 15, but I'm guiding it down just because of my natural progression. I don't have the same return requirements. When I'm thinking about getting that 12 per year, that 10 per year, really 8 per year, it could be whatever it is for you, 20 per year. This is the primary way I'm expecting to do it. So I am going to wait the core allocation of my portfolio to give me the highest probability of success to hit that goal. The speculative is when I have a hypothesis, when there's something that's playing out that I think there's an opportunity and I want to take advantage of it. For example, SBB, the financial sector right now, the overall market volatility right now, it's why I'm so invested as of today is because I am leveraging this speculative allocation of my portfolio significantly.",

And it's because I see a lot of opportunity. So how do I break these out? Well, in terms of the overall allocation of the portfolio, for the core, I allow myself to use up to the entire portfolio on a core position. So this is something like a coverage strangle in IWM. If for whatever reason, I want to have all of my portfolio in that position, I'm fine with it. That's no problem for me. I'm okay with the variance. Is it exactly what I do? Probably not. I would probably add some sort of inverse related product or something to hedge some of the risk, whether it's adding bonds. And it's just because there's not a huge reason for me to be 100 invested in my portfolio at this point. But back in the day, this was common for me speculative. This is guided down significantly from what it used to be part of it is because as my accounts grown, I have a larger dollar amount to play with. So 40 is plenty. However, if I wasn't in that scenario, speculative used to be allowed to be up to 80 of the portfolio. And there's times",

You have to figure out what's right for you based on your objectives. But the name of the game here is figuring out what makes sense and what's right for you. Then what kind of strategies do I run in these different allocations? So for the core allocation, I typically run things like the coverage strangle ratio diagonals. And when I say the coverage strangle, it's all the individual components of that as well. So it's things like cash secure puts. It's things like ratio covered calls, things like that. And when I look at the speculative allocation, it's essentially everything. Now I typically don't trade the coverage strangle in the speculative. That's not a hard and fast rule. It's just not my typical go to. And then I have things like straddles, strangles, long and short single options, earnings plays, like the event driven play today in SVB, FOMC meetings. This is where there's events that I'm trading around and I'll pair it with a strategy. So within this allocation that I have for the core and speculative allocation of my portfolios, I then sub-allocate to the",

So within this allocation that I have for the core and speculative allocation of my portfolios, I then sub-allocate to the individual positions based on how I feel about them, how much money I want tied up in each one of the positions. And the way that I think about the individual positions is realistically speaking, if it's a coverage strangle, I allocate more of the portfolio. Like I said, I would do 100 of my portfolio in IWM coverage strangle, no problem. Typically speaking though, it would be guided down a bit based on where I want the rest of my positions on. So for my core allocation, let's say I currently have 60 of the portfolio utilized and I have 50 of that tied up in the coverage strangle of that 50 that's tied up. It's not all out at a given point in time. This is a big part of my scaling protocols, which I talk about pretty regularly and it's an important part of what I do. So as you can see, there's different tiers to all of this capital management and scaling and it gives me an immense amount of control over things. Exactly how in 2022, when the market was down 19, I was up 20. It's not because I'm a genius and learned what",

Exactly how in 2022, when the market was down 19, I was up 20. It's not because I'm a genius and learned what was going to happen before it was going to do and made some sort of great trades based on it. I traded with the market showed me, but I have plenty of capital that I can ebb and flow based on market conditions. And another great example is same thing in last year, 2022. My IRA account, which I only had 32 trades in total was up about 5. It didn't trade that much. It's based on capital management. It's based on the way that I think about the risk and the portfolio so that I can ebb and flow as I see opportunity come and as I see opportunity go. So all in all, if you do not have a systematic approach to managing your portfolio, you're going to be a mess. It's going to be impossible for you to crack things in depth and then also most importantly validate what you're doing. We're thinking about our portfolio management. It needs to be a process exactly as I've outlined here. I'm going to start with my objective that are quantified figure out where I'm sitting against those.

What is the correlation of the products? Is there anything that I need to adjust from a portfolio level and what is my market hypothesis? How does all of this rack and stack together?
