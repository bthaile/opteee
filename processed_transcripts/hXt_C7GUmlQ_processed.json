    "text": "game. So I'm going to walk you through what I'm seeing here because yesterday I was not planning on doing an update video and we saw a very meaningful expansion in call volume today. We actually see the same. I'm also seeing a lot of conjecture about roaring Kitty slash DFV by more calls. I'm going to walk you through exactly what I'm seeing in terms of how viable that might be as a theory. Couple things do come to mind for me. The first one is based on the call volume yesterday. I actually entered a position on earlier today myself. And that's specifically because I am designed as an options trader to look for opportunity, agnostic of how it shows itself and that kind of volume actually is something that I tend to trade. So that's how I originally came across this entire saga when roaring Kitty at the time I didn't know is him was buying a bunch of calls and it popped up on a few of my scanners. So let's take a look at what's going on here. 24th of June yesterday I actually wasn't planning on doing an update. So all that crazy call volume. So I was like, let me take a look with everybody. See what I see. And the call volume is interesting. What was really annoying honestly about yesterday was this. I couldn't dig into the details on what was going on. So I actually used another tool that I",

I couldn't dig into the details on what was going on. So I actually used another tool that I have access to to help me pull the tool down a bunch of market data to look at what this looked like. And I'll show you that in just a moment. But starting from the top as per usual, we see a really interesting movement in volatility. And what I mean by that is not just the fact that the front month has expanded nearly 60 points from 142 volatile to 201. But even more interesting. Obviously there's less time. There's only three days left to expiration. And now this is expecting a 3.6 move. It's actually a little higher than that last I looked as compared to the 2.79. That's not an insignificant difference. But that's also nothing that's going to send us to the moon. It's just interesting. Then I look across the options chain here. And it's bumpy. And that might sound a little esoteric. I'll explain exactly what that means. It's kind of weird. It's almost like if you ever watch the matrix when that one dude the operator.

What's happened was we have this jacked up of all that comes down comes down a little bit more. But then goes back up. Very interesting. And I also don't think it's any mistake that this is the 19th July expiration. Obviously, op X is typically a thing across products. But you can tell that's also part of what's going on here. So I'm going to go through the time and sales with you all. Then as we continue down this path 156 now drops back down to 150 140 142. Very interesting. The fact that we have volatility that's kind of ebbing and flowing like this and not observing more either like a standard smile",

I think we've hit that going down to the implied volatility curve. Again, these kinks are getting massive compared to what we saw even recently. If we go back here, take a look at some of the kinks we're seeing in the front expiration. And then if we start going back to what we were just looking at now, like these are very large now, which is really interesting, especially notice how smooth it is on the put side. The other thing is the put side is continuing to expand. As you guys back on Sunday, I fully expect to see this. And again, this is a tradable event for the options traders out there, specifically those who can isolate volatility. This is a very predictable movement at this point right now on the product where we're seeing the near term out of the money far out of the money. Pretty meaningfully, and as of late, the far out of the money call volatility is not moving in line with it. Whereas before it was actually outpacing it pretty significantly. Okay.

And let's see what they have to say it says the 20 mark flooding with calls for the 19th of July. I don't see this. And I want to take a look at it with you guys to maybe see what I might be missing and what time frame you guys are looking at. Because so far, this isn't what I'm seeing. And let's see keep an eye on this today, but just remember premium on this shot up a week later when he posted his yellow update. Speculation called it then calling it now watch this 20 call option today and tomorrow. So this was from earlier today, the 20th of the June. So let's take a look at the 20 call option volume from today. And if I pop in here, we scroll down to this right now, I have it filtered by just the 20s and I have it limited to minimum 500 size buys. We can open this up just a little bit more maybe to add a little more efficacy behind the thesis. And here's what I see.",

Three tranches of call volumes go through at the 20 in 19 July, one for 16, oh, one for 28 June. I see all very small size. And again, I'm not trying to put down the idea. The idea might be right still. I'm just telling you what I see here today. I don't see this big massive flow into the 20s today in any expiration cycle. I see overall really small transactions. That's what this shows me. And then I do see actually more put transactions is also somewhat interesting. There could be something to be said about people looking to transact puts. And it's like kind of split right like if we look at the overall volume today, it's kind of split down the middle between people that are selling and buying puts. Whereas on the call side, that's not the case on the call side. They're buying calls 35 which is a six point lead over selling calls. So that's not insignificant, but it's not materializing necessarily centralized in this 20. So then if I get rid of this strike limitation and I open it up, we see that there's 60 calls that have had",

So then if I get rid of this strike limitation and I open it up, we see that there's 60 calls that have had a pretty big volume. I'm seeing 1474. Then in the 22s, I'm seeing just shy of a thousand. Then I'm seeing that this is put side don't care. Don't care. Like even this it's just not a ton of big positions. So then this does beg the question. Is it possible that we're in kitty is buying calls? Yes. Is it possible that he's buying calls in much smaller sizes than what he did previously? Yes, that is possible. The reason why it's possible is because he doesn't have the same amount of liquid capital that he did before. Right. So if I try to find, let me pull this up real quick. Here we go. This is back from an update I did on the 13th of June. I'm pretty sure this is the position he posted on the 10th of June. So obviously it's actually a little bit old now. We don't know what this looks like, but what I'm highly like, he's still has 6 million in cash. It's not as much as he did before because he put on a massive options position before. This case, it's much more conservative. So is it possible that some",

It's not as much as he did before because he put on a massive options position before. This case, it's much more conservative. So is it possible that some of the buying activity that we're seeing is wearing kitty? Sure, it is possible. What I can tell you though is based on what I've seen him do previously. This doesn't line up, but it could not line up for those reasons. It could be that he's entering with a much smaller stake. But still, if we kind of go with this theme of looking at the 20s, I really want to focus on a specific point because if we look at the value of these transactions, it's just not that much that we've seen today. So we have 4 at 200, something like that. So it's 80 grand. Like we're not even in the ballpark of his sizes because the thing is is even for, he's still has 6 million at least the last we saw. So punchline, could this be him? Yes. Does it seem to be likely it's him based on previous buy activity that I've seen? And it also based on sizing, even if he's not looking to use all six, but if he's looking to use two, right, putting on an 80 grand position at a clip with just one doesn't really make sense. And",

So if we break it down to long calls, there's three tranches that are pretty far apart, which is much further apart than what he was transacting at when he was phasing in and out of his previous options positions. And again, these are all very small positions, very, very small position. Don't feel insecure. It's okay. Small positions still a position. But I don't really think that this is roaring kitty again.

It's this front expiration. The probability of roaring kitty putting on a massive options position today, yesterday, that set to expire this week. It's so low because IV is so expensive. He's bidding himself up. He has to do something with the position before the end of the week. So it doesn't really have any time to work. I don't see him coming here. If he's buying, if he's looking to build a position, I would expect it to be further out. But again, who really knows he's done a lot of things so far that when I try to assess it objectively, I can't always connect the dots.

So it's still very probable that they land out of the money. So they're not going to have a bunch of shares to cover these more often than not. And we can tell again, definitively from the volume, even if we wipe out all of the, oh, I with the volume that transacted today, at least 10,000 were opened. So this does look like a lot of buying volume. And the other thing that I find interesting is that it's at the money that's not the cheapest place.

I am going to be watching like an absolute hawk now, this option is chain. Not even the front expiration again, like it's interesting to me with the wall. But I am so curious about this volume that we're seeing. Because if we click this in and see where most of that 277 is, 165, 800 is in the front expiration. Then if we go out the next two explorations, it's 47 total. Then if we go to 19 July, it's 38 against eight. So really big call skew in terms of volume here as well. But it's not as much. All of the activity right now is up here in the in the 28 June. Massive, massive call volume on a relative basis. So I'm going to keep watching. I'm going to see if any interesting buying activity comes in. I'm going to keep looking at the volatility. See if anything is keying off there. And we'll see where we go from here.
