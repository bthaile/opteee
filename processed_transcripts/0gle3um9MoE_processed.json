    "text": "What's up, Elias? Got three things for the market update today. First, we're going to talk about dollar general. Then we're going to talk about the tech sector. Then we're going to talk about game stop. Let's get right to it. So the first thing is dollar general had a hell of a day today. And as you can tell, it closed at the bottom of this candle. It just got shoved down all day. It tried to rally a little bit post earnings. And it's earnings wasn't a bismal, but it definitely wasn't good. So we can take a look through what happened. This was before the market opened. And it dropped over 25. And we can see that it came in at 170 per share, which is down from 213 year over year. And it was expected at 179. Net sales came in 1021, 10.21 billion, which actually expanded. That doesn't seem too bad to me. But this is the big problem. So it expects fiscal 2024, EPS of 550 to 620 in sales growth, 4.75 to 5.3 which is down. So yeah, this is one of the things that you'll find with forward guidance is this exact kind of scenario. The market was originally expecting it at 712. This obviously is really missing that to the downside, unfortunately for them. So they are behind the curve here. Now the other thing I want to take a look at with you is just the indices, but specifically tech",

Now the other thing I want to take a look at with you is just the indices, but specifically tech because tech really had a pretty big problem out here. So if we take a look at first the sectors, and we can see what's going on here, tech is still, this is now in a negative sloping channel. Like this is very clearly trending down. And we're still seeing relative weakness across quite a few of the sectors, but it definitely looks like to me tech is leading us to the downside. The SP 500 is staying a little more resilient, trending sideways here, but tech is in the picture. That's one of the biggest things that I see here. And if we take a look across the indices, we can see that again, Q's, which is a little more tech heavy than the others, is already moving down towards these moving averages. Yes, MPA 500 still has a little bit of room here before it starts rotating over, but then we're seeing the Russell actually bucking the trend. Vix is down. Curious, huh? So Vix is down, market is down. That happens sometimes. It's not quite as infrequent as people might think, but still interesting to see this slowing amidst the rest of this seaming, potential sell-off accelerating.",

Now quick recap on Nvidia. I was curious how it was going to fare today. And I actually fell a little more than I expected earlier in the day was hovering right around 120s that seemed about where it was going to be. And then it looked like it was being held up, propped up pretty strong, actually by people interested in it, but they just couldn't hold on. And there's a massive sale candle today with over 89 sale volume. So people were just unwinding here. And I get it. This was a pretty interesting earnings release because it was so, so focused on Nvidia and the impact of the broader market. And then the tone for AI, all these kinds of things are so topical right now. So I totally get it. But it's just a little more emotional than I was expecting. It seemed like it was hanging in there and then it just kind of broke down the rest of the day. So yeah, this is interesting to me, but something that I think is not unexpected after its earnings. Because again, I was talking about this before the",

Because again, I was talking about this before the earnings in here need it to be perfect in order for it to continue this kind of parabolic ascent. So it doesn't surprise me that we find ourselves in this scenario with Nvidia. The way I'm looking at tech right now is it still to me is very promising long term. But short term, it looks a little weaker and something that I'm definitely going to be minding my exposure in. So now we need to take a look at GameStop. Because GameStop had a great day today. And again, it's not like a huge day, but I am so stoked that it started coming into this value area. And immediately started rejecting right back out. Like that was great for me to see us. Very, very happy with that. I still see RSI both raw RSI and the EMA below the 50 handles. So I don't love that from just a general strength picture. But this was a good day in here. And the other thing is we can see the volume really stepped up big time. Again, it's really hard to see because the volume is so skewed by all this noise back here. But if you take",

Come the tenth after the market closes. So now the other thing is I took a look through just the options flow for both games stop and chewy to see if anything stuck out to me. Not a lot if I'm being completely honest with you. But there were a few more transactions that came in above 100,000. But it's still just five. So there's not a tremendous amount of activity and a lot of it is further out in time. So we see these 26 explorations. Let me see this 25 expiration.

So yeah, just not quite as much going on there. We're just okay. It's still relatively quiet in here. So if we take a look at the options, let's take a look at the volume. Today we had 211,000 calls trade against 47,000 puts, which this is actually quite a lot. And 30 August super active. And we can see the six set was also fairly active. My expectation here is that we'll continue to see both of these walls rise as they are. And I think that we start building out this 13 set sooner rather than later. That's my guess. So if we take a look at the open interest, 576,000 calls against 280,000 puts, general calls queue in here, not super heavy, but it's still there, which is good to see. And we can see though that a lot of these calls are actually further out in time, which is generally anomalous. So the 17,000, 25s. That's where a lot of the largest positions are, which again, previously we would see much more of that in the near term explorations. The 30 Augs have one 10 against 29k on the put side. So strong call skew here, but we'll take a look at how many of those are out of",

Now the last thing I want to talk about with respect to game stop is, as I look through the order flow here, I see a really healthy mix across explorations, which again, this is not so much the case that I've typically seen in the product. I generally see this specific ticker. Look like the majority of volume tends to be centralized in the front explorations. And we can still see some elements of that, right? Like all these 30 Augs. It's still happening to a degree, but I am seeing way more other explorations pop up on this list. Doesn't really mean a whole lot. It just means that we're not hyper concentrated in the front expiration. Like we have been previously. And I draw your attention to it simply because it is an observation that I have.
