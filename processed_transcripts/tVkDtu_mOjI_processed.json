    "text": "Music what's up outliers quick market update two things on the agenda we have GameStop two things for GameStop I want to talk about this case with Ryan Cohen and then I want to take a look at this question from my boy Bruce uh he sent it in I think a couple days ago and I I was going to review it yesterday and I forgot to so we'll hit this one today as well and then the second broader topic is the chewy offering quote unquote which we'll take a look at that together so first first so that I do not forget we're going to start with this one here we're going to start with Bruce's Bruce's question about analyzing the volume on the January 20 calls from the 18th so let's take a look at what's going on we'll kill that jump over to the platform and we'll get right in well first off GameStop has been very very quietly trending sideways so from a stock trading perspective it's now starting to fall within this range that starts to become a little more interesting in terms of which way does it break and as you can see on a shorter term time frame when we get rid of a lot of those you know other like spikes the chart normalizes and you can see that we're still seeing longer term moving averages positive sloping but they are starting to become negative sloping on the day so",
