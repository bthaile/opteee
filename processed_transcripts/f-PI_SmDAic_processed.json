It was also very close and We ended up closing today at 24 97 Close very close but not quite spend most of the day above that handle can help I find that slightly interesting now another interesting component to this though is the fact that we were bumping up against the point of control or the volume profile which is what this is here It just tells me where we were transacting the most within a specific time frame in this case a three-month daily There's a lot of people that are holding shares right now at 26 44 like somewhere around there and if we go out to six months It's kind of right around that same exact period 26 48-ish and then if we go out to a year You'll notice it's still very close to that 26 62 the reason why that matters so much is because a lot of times when you look at different time frames You'll actually see the point of control move around as people are buying at all different kinds of time frames This doesn't surprise me to see a lot of selling happening as we get up to this point of control because for a lot of people This is where they've been holding for a pretty prolonged period of time and Some people are trying to get out",

It doesn't feel comfortable saying that So let's take a look at the options chains What are we seeing? Well the very first thing is compared to yesterday volatility has now expanded actually quite a lot And I don't think that that's Coincidental I think that we're starting to see a Heavy amount of options activity So when I look at this today There was over three hundred thousand calls that transacted today and only 86,000 puts Very heavy call activity. This has been hovering in like the mid-to's and it's even been now below two a couple times over the last week or so So this is a reasonable surge in call volume and it's very much centered Around the 19 July and the 12 July expiration. So if I just look at those two 255,500 of that volume are in these front two expressions As you can see here Now we have a little bit of a lone ranger all the way up here And this is showing us in the 19 July the 30s there was 41,700 Contract trades today And if we just take a quick look at that specific contract to get a sense of how Prevalent it was was there any really big sizing And apparently",

I messed up So yeah, because there was that dude that I saw come through buying the tens which was a little different And it was a pretty meaningful size position And it looks like they're still there so I remember there was around 300 oh, I you guys can fact check me to make sure I'm not completely off base here, but I think that that's right So What's the deal here? Well a couple things One of the things I noticed is volatility is coming up here. This was really low This was like low ones just yesterday in the day before And now it's already starting to peak back up so you could tell that the more the options market knows When there's expiration coming shit gets weird like that's the trend the overwhelming trend That I've started to pick up on since I've started following this more closely and rightfully so I totally get why it does that When I look at most of the call",

I know I do is there's way more of these 16 augs popping up here here here here We're seeing more red squares popping up in here That's important because this also means that there are people playing multiple cycles right like for me I was in the 16 augs and I actually just recently moved out to the 20 September's But that's the way that I trade these things It's very different than most people that I come across at least in the space that are really really centered on these super short-term explorations.

It's just not how I do it. So I don't I don't find it anything other than Conviction leading people out to establishing this far out at this point because it's still kind of early We didn't see this kind of building in this 16 aug which in this case are 37 days out We didn't see this kind of building in the prior expiration cycles at least for the last few weeks people have been playing the fronts Very very heavily. So another interesting data point here So that's mostly what I'm seeing here We have an expansion of volatility in the short term without a doubt I see 139 134 132 and then it starts to drop off a cliff from there So my expectation would be as like something like 16 aug gets closer I would fully expect this volatility to start expanding that's kind of the overall trend that I've been seeing And it's also something I've actually started trading Because it has been fairly consistent thus far with meaningful moves I should add So As always any questions anything I should take a look at let me know be an outlier see you guys later",
