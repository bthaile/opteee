    "text": "you know I didn't have this one on my bingo card I really thought today GameStop was going to crack above 25 it was oh so very close and we ended up closing today at 2497 close very close but not quite spend most of the day above that handle can't help but find that slightly interesting now another interesting component to this though is the fact that we were bumping up against the point of control for the volume profile which is what this is here it just tells me where we were transacting the most with in a specific time frame in this case a 3-month daily there's a lot of people that are holding shares right now at 2644 like somewhere around there and if we go out to 6 months it's kind of right around that same exact period 2648 is and then if we go out to a year you'll notice it's still very close to that 2662 the reason why that matters so much is because a lot of times when you look at different time frames you'll actually see the point of control move around as people are buying at all different kinds of time frames this doesn't surprise me to see a lot of selling happening as we get up to this point of control because for a lot of people this is where they've been holding for a pretty prolong period of time and some people are trying to get out",

    "text": "out to the 20 September but that's the way that I trade these things it's very different than most people that I come across at least in this space that are really really centered on these super short-term expirations it's just not how I do it so I don't I don't find it anything other than conviction leading people out to establishing this far out at this point because it's still kind of early we didn't see this kind of building in this 16 a which in this case are 3 days out we didn't see this kind of building in the prior expiration Cycles at least for the last few weeks people have been playing the fronts very very heavily so another interesting data point here so that's mostly what I'm seeing here we have an expansion of volatility in the short term without a doubt I see 139 134 132 and then it starts to drop off a cliff from there so my expectation would be as like something like 16 all gets closer I would fully expect this volatility to start expanding that's kind of the overall trend that I've been seeing and it's also something I've actually started trading because it has been fairly consistent thus far with meaningful moves I should add so as always any questions anything I should take a look at let me know be an outlier see you guys later",
