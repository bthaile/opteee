It'll be a quick video because not a lot of happened today. There's a couple small things that I want to point out. I want to take a stroll through GME specifically as per usual, keeping that on the cadence. A lot of people are interested in staying up to date on the options chain there. So we'll do that. And yeah, should be a pretty simple one here. Now, I got to say hello from the other side because now I'm on this side of the screen per the recommendation of one of our discord members, which was probably the simplest recommendation on planet earth that makes such a tremendous amount of sense so that I'm now not in the way of things. So you guys will have to find something else to not be happy about in the videos. So I mean, we'll see what you guys come up with. There's always something I suppose. So what do we want to talk about? The main thing is this, SP 500 and the queues did nothing today. It was a completely flat, boring day with these tiny little baby candles that just are not moving much. IWM, however, continued to diverge. This is important. The reason why it's important is take a look at where spy landed, take",

This is important. The reason why it's important is take a look at where spy landed, take a look at where queues landed, and then take a look at where IWM landed. IWM is now essentially at the close that it saw on the sixth. The other two indices are still above. They're still rallying, although they've contracted a bit. This is important. The other thing is the SP 500 as an index with the percentage of stocks above. This is using their 50 day moving average is cratered, even though this didn't move quite that much. So I interpret most of this as under the top level rotation and small caps are still seeing the brunt of it. The other thing I noticed is take a look at the sale volume today in IWM as compared the sale volume in spy and queues. You can see kind of how much of that candle or the bar down here is consumed in red. In this case, it's the majority. So if we take a look at IWM quickly, specifically, we can see the exact number which was 75 sale volume. So heavy sale volume today, hovering right around this point of control.

So heavy sale volume today, hovering right around this point of control. This is an important level for me. This is also why I do not have any sort of long position right now on small caps, even though I do still find them interesting. And I think that there's still opportunity for them, but I think as it sits right now, it's just not great. And I need to see what it's going to do. Now one other admin note is various risk premium plays are still coming in literally beautifully. And I noticed that because we can see it even here in the Russell where various risk premiums have just spiked essentially from the ninth to the 12th, this is just expanding very meaningfully. And this is the short term, the RP is moving quite a lot. So I'm still trading zeros. I'm still using SPX myself, but another great opportunity here inside IWM. Now as far as SPX, I'm running a couple positions in here. I got filled on some box spreads. I can tell you what it was. It's the 30 aug 5,000, 6,000 strikes for 997. So those are a thousand point wide. And they have 18 days to expiration right now. The percent annual yield for the duration of that trade is 6.081 percent with fees included. It's like plus 0.71",

It's a very basic Excel sheet, but I like it. It's cool. And you can access it if you want. There's a video that I did. If you literally just type in box spreads, you'll probably see a pop up because not a lot of people are talking about that stuff. It's kind of boring. It's a big part of what I do with capital that's otherwise sitting on the sidelines. Because in this case, my money is going to earn again, 6.081 percent annualized return. That's not the total return on the trade as it goes out. That's really important to note that's annualized. The return on invested capital will be much lower than that.

Because right now the current risk-free rate is for a one month is 537. And it tailors down from there. Two months is 5295 and so on and so forth. So rates are chilling out a little bit. There are still some kinks in the structure. So three year is at 3, 843. Five year is at 3758. And then seven year is at 3805. So five is depressed compared to the three and the seven. You can trade those kinds of relationships too, but kind of a boring trade. Not what I'm looking at right now myself. Okay, so that's that. Now let's pivot over to GME, GME. It's on a like GME. Didn't mean that. It meant GME. And I mean, you literally can't even see the volume, which is unfortunate. It's just so light volume. We're not, we're really just not seeing much happening here. So the percent by volume for today is 52 versus 48 on the sales side. Total volume was 4.4 million against 10.4 million. So just anemic volume. Now one admin note is I know a lot of people talk about the dark pool volume and how you don't really get to see the actual volume. There's just an important difference between dark pool, ATS transactions versus transactions that are internalized. They're kind of different things. So with dark",

So if orders, if there's heavy internalization of orders, you're not going to see any they'll follow through. And that's one of the problems with GameStop. I actually don't know to what degree the orders are being internalized. And if anybody has good research on that, I genuinely would love to be able to take a look at it. If you have access to it, let me know so that I can take a peek, throw it in the comments below because I'm very interested in that question. Because we know that for GameStop, the off exchange volume is massive. However, if we take a look at the off exchange volume today, it was 47.64. And the 30 day average is 52. So a little bit lighter than that. Now again, the problem with this is we don't actually know of this off exchange volume. How much of it is internalized versus not? In this case, obviously, I would assume not internalized because we have a number. But this then doesn't help us",

In this case, obviously, I would assume not internalized because we have a number. But this then doesn't help us understand what the total volume is that's been internalized. So yeah, I would be interested in exploring that problem set a little bit more and learning more about it myself because I do find that to be an interesting potential problem when we're looking at the reporting and something like GameStop. Now let's take a quick look over at the options chain. And there's a few things I want to highlight. First off, volume very light, less than 100,000 calls against 21,000 puts. Now it is again, good to see such a disparity between calls and puts. Most of it is centralized in this expiration cycle. So we are still seeing a ton of volume in this front expiration cycle. So as we take a closer look at the existing open interest, it's 669 to 337. So again, this is also good that the calls are being built out more and more. And we are seeing some of these other expiration cycles being built out alongside of it. However, the majority of what I'm seeing so far indicates kind of a quiet week, two weeks ahead from an options perspective, that doesn't mean that the stock can't pop off as",

    "text": "and more. And we are seeing some of these other expiration cycles being built out alongside of it. However, the majority of what I'm seeing so far indicates kind of a quiet week, two weeks ahead from an options perspective, that doesn't mean that the stock can't pop off as soon as there's a catalyst. That's what makes it special and do what it does. But there's just not a lot of positioning expecting that is compared to what I saw when I originally got into GameStop towards the end of April early May. So we can still see a bunch of net ads coming in. So people are still building into these positions, which is not super surprising. And these 50s are getting hit pretty heavy. So there's 1869 for with 6000 added over the last trading day, another 1600 traded today. You can see that there's just a lot of volume on these near the money options. And again, this goes back into this is a tough way to make money. And these are swimming upstream because they need a big move very quick in order for them to really show a profit. Now these have a little bit more of a padding because faded decay on these is like 10 cents, 9 cents against something that's 64, 65 cents total or maybe 45 cents for these 22 and a half. That's still a massive percentage of the remaining premium that's bleeding out from faded decay, which is",

That's still a massive percentage of the remaining premium that's bleeding out from faded decay, which is kind of problematic. You really need to move quick in order for this to make sense. What I see also of interest is, vol has collapsed essentially across the entire option chain. We only see slightly elevated vol in 13 in 20 set expiration cycles. And it has earnings on four set, which is really important to me because I would expect this expiration cycle, the six step expiration cycle to be much higher than it is relative to 13 and 20. The fact that 13 and 20 are higher than six and six is the expiration cycle that includes the release, at least as it's scheduled right now here, fourth before the market is fascinating to me. That isn't anomaly. That's not normal. You do not see that frequently, which again can't help but find that interesting. Now looking across, I didn't see anything jump out at me in terms of TNS time and sales. There's a glorious mix of positions going out. There's a mix of expiration cycles from 16-OG, 23-OG, kind of again standard fare, but most of these are really small positions, right? So the 125s, 334 trade went out, but they're trading for two pennies.",

So the 125s, 334 trade went out, but they're trading for two pennies. The bigger trades are kind of these that have a higher price. Sometimes I like sorting by them not to see a million NAs that's actually kind of annoying. I don't even know why they put them in here, but it's to find these. These are the bigger trades. You can see most of these are kind of deeper in the monies, and we still see those far out in time, 125s, getting pinged off a little bit. Can't help but find that interesting. Some of these still look like the other side of the trade that looked like originally sold these. So, because there was a fairly large position over 1 million, notional value that started hitting these. But yeah, most of the trades that are at any reasonable size are not so, not at really high prices, what I'm trying to say there. So if I switch this minimum quantity being like a 25 lot, something, again, let's do 10 lot actually, because sometimes people I notice move blocks of 10 in here. And if we look at minimum 10, we're not seeing a bunch of these. Now, these, again, further out in time, people building longer term",
