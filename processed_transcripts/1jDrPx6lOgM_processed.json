So I was fortunate enough to get Brent on and so he is a fascinating background, but first off, thank you for taking the time to, you know, hop on chat with me a little bit and share some your experience. Sure. Good to see you and there's definitely a good synergy between trading and people with military backgrounds. In fact, two of the best traders that, so I've had, I've been to manage her a lot at various banks and two of the best traders that ever worked for me were both military backgrounds. So not a coincidence. Yeah. It's, it makes sense to me in a lot of ways though, just because of the discipline. I think that that's such a big thing, which, you know, I think, yeah, I mean, there's a couple of things that the discipline and then also, I think the stakes don't feel as high. Like if you've been in the military and then you come to trading, it's like, yeah, okay, it's scary to, you know, whatever is going to happen to your P and L, but it's not comparable to real life, you know, military situations and the needless to say. And then also, maybe this is just more of like a quirk, but generally people that come to Wall Street from the military are older and more mature. So it's not like a 22 year old like Quant, who's, you know, never been out of their",

And I'm not saying that I was because I was very immature when I came to Wall Street, but, and so that was probably weakness in mind, but a lot of military people come, you know, as adults that are mature and, and kind of ready to sit down and get to work. So yeah, it's an interesting observation. So I, I do find that a lot just in terms of the scale of the perception of risk is really important because yeah, I think a lot of retail traders focus a lot on if they're actually developed for retail traders, they focus on risk a lot. But I think a lot of people forget the other side of that equation, you know, that reward is tied to risk. And a lot of people become really risk averse, then you can't really make any money if you're too risk averse. And yeah, that's interesting.

And so that has generally for me been harnessed in trading by like rules and, and systems and things like that. Right. And so as a manager, when I was like 30 or so, I started managing people and I started managing more and more people. And the biggest surprise or one of the biggest surprises to me was how risk averse people actually are. And I kind of thought, oh, everyone must be like me. I'll just need these rules to like pull the reins back on everyone. And actually most of the guys that and I'm saying guys have not all men worked for me, but mostly men and some.

One is your positions are too small and you can't pull the trigger. That's kind of like the textbook thing, right? Like I can't can't always waiting for the perfect trade and all that. Yeah. But then there's another form of it, which is people that put on risk, but then just always want to take it off. So like any excuse like, oh, the price action, you know, should have gone down by now and and that kind of like there's a lot of traders that will just make a million excuses because it's the having the risk that makes them nervous, not the putting it on. Right. I found that really interesting when I started becoming a manager on Wall Street was that actually 80 of people are risk averse.

So everyone, I think like a really important thing in this whole dialogue is being really self aware about what your thing is like, you know, you risk averse. Are you like, what are you going at and what are you not good at? And like for me, one big breakthrough I had was acknowledging. So like everyone wants to like get better, right? Like self improvement and that that sort of like the, the, the, sorry, like the growth mindset and all that is like, I'm not who I am now or I am now, but I can be anything through improvement and stuff.

Draft Planet? Yeah, that's right. Yeah. So I was doing that and trading the Nasdaq bubble at the same time. So yes, anyways, 100 accurate so far. All right. And I even got the cartoon name. I'm pretty so I'm pretty good research. I watched a couple episodes of it actually on YouTube. It's like, it's actually really good. I think that the timing was rough because I know that South Park was getting big in the mid 90s. And they did it.

So South Park helped us because the sort of like way in animation in that time was basically like script and story over animation quality because South Park's animation quality was low like intentionally. The bar to make like a show wasn't as high. So like our our show was actually the first one the first animated TV show made in Flash like remember Flash. I don't know. Okay, Flash was like a program that was used mostly for online animation. Okay. And so our show was the first one is still like caustic 250 grand an episode, but that was cheap at the time for for a show. So yeah, but the business model generally in Canada for for a lot of artistic things is you got to sell it in the US within like a year or two because that's like really interesting. The economies of scale in the Canadian market being like one tenth the size of the US are right. Right. Like depending on what the thing is. And then when you release in the US, you get like the big marketing halo and all that because the US TV and rate like not radio now, but the TV and and print and all that like all kind of flows back into Canada. So so anyways, we never sold it in the US. So I'll let you continue. Interesting. Yeah, I mean, that's interesting",

That's right. Yeah. Okay. And then you did some time in hedge funds after that mixed hedge funds. I know that you worked at a couple of places. You see and I think what city also or is that? Yes, I went back to city again. So basically what happened was like this is this is relevant to trading. So I'll tell you a little bit more detail was around like 2000 right around the cusp of when the bubble peak. I think like April 2000. I think it was a peak March April 2000. It was getting harder to do what I was doing, but it was still fine. So mostly my strategy was I had a in those days, you had a like the SP pit was still a thing like the actual pit in or whatever. So I had a like a feed like a earphone, whatever to to guide the squawk from the pit. And you could kind of get an sense of like when SPs were bit and when they were heavy and all",

So like stocks trading from 100 to 500 a share. And when you could feel like bullish energy in the pit in the SPs, you get on I get on the bid and all the stocks. So if it was 100 and some of them were trading pretty wide like 100 102 say like some of the the shitty tech stocks were trading. So I'd go at that time it was fraction. So I'd go 100 and one eighth bid. And there was enough retail back and forth. Sometimes you'd get filled, but in a in a moment where like SPs were kind of ticking higher. So you know, obviously that was a good time to be getting filled on the bid. And then you just try it off for the amount at 101 and 7 eighths right away. Got it.

What you want is like absolute value and low volume because the commission was the was a big thing in those days. So like it was a much easier to be gross positive, but obviously you had to be net positive. So you wanted to pay as little bro as you could in those days. It actually mattered a lot. So anyway, just sorry, just to curiosity, what kind of leverage were you using if you were I mean you're taking for what like a point ride or something like that? Yeah. So like not very much like I open my account with 25 grand and I think we only had two to one at two to one margin. I'm pretty sure. Oh, okay. So yeah, interesting.

Like I don't know what I'm I don't know how to make money anymore. So and it coincided a whole bunch of things happened. So the show got canceled right around that same time as decimalization.

So back into FX trading. But the reason that I left part of the reason I left originally was Mark making was 100 flow in the 90s. It was just like super transactional. So 100 by 50 and basically you're just trying to keep track of your position and like take all the crumbs and make 100 grand and be happy. And now so like now fast forward to 2022.

And then also writing about macro and being more strategic, trying to take positions and like forecast the market and like kind of what I always thought trading really was as opposed to what market making is, which is executing transactions for external counter parties, which wasn't I didn't never found very much fun. But the downside of that is that like when I started at city in 1995, the spot spot is like you know two day settlement currency trades. So normal currency trades that people think of like you know I'm buying Euro, I'm selling dollar yen or whatever, that's spot. And the spot desk at city New York was 30 people when I started. And now like most spot desks are three three people because computers can do most almost all the trades. So you as a market maker and FX now, you basically do like the huge trades.

And then some actually doing quant stuff as well, which that's not really my area. Like I'm I'm functional in next cell and stuff, but I'm not like applied math guy. Got it. Yeah, I've had a couple people that I've worked with and actually my best friend is kind of a super nerd when it comes to excel and sometimes I feel proficient, but then I do stuff around them and then I just feel like an idiot.

Yeah, true. And then you just said this kid is in middle school. I just cut and based his code straight in Excel. So one of my main questions, I think I was telling you before we started.

I think generally, first of all, having an edge in any product is extremely difficult and there's so much empirical data that supports that. You know, what day traders and equities are FX or whatever, the success rate is very low. But the upside is huge. So like not just financially, but also like quality of life and enjoyment, you know, like I have some stuff that I've written in my book about like the relationship between money and happiness and everyone has their own curve and all that. And my curve's pretty flat. Like, you know, making more money doesn't really make me happier.

Although less connected than it used to be, I guess, like financial markets in the real world have been drifting apart for the last 15 years. So yeah. Now, one of the things I'm curious about, again, just kind of from a selfish perspective in my own curiosity. Yeah. So when I was trading FX, it felt like longer time frames were very difficult for me to align with to figure out where things were most likely to go. I'm sure it's a good amount of experience that I was missing for that. But I what led me closer to equities was it felt more forgiving where things I could swing trade or even trade, you know, like I like to trade options like I was telling you, so I'll have leaps diagonals on that I managed in six to nine months.

But then their stop is like four percent below the market or whatever. And like so that would be a timing mismatch of like a super macro trade with a stop loss like 1.5 days ranges away. Right.

But my experience is that like sometimes I feel like I can basically see what's going to happen before it's happening for like a day or two. And then I try to hold on to it for another day and another day and then I end up giving the whole thing back. So whatever it is that I have that where I can like see like I feel like I can see the future because of probably pattern recognition and stuff like that. It seems to dissipate after about two days. And like my I keep a lot of data on my trading data on my trading and it supports that as well. And actually just one takeaway for people watching is if you keep data on your trading, you'll learn 80 of the stuff you you find in the data will be like yeah I knew that I lose money in the afternoons or whatever. But there'll be a few nuggets in there where you're like whoa like I didn't know that like I had no idea. And actually I said the losing money in the afternoons thing.

So when I worked I worked at a hedge fund for a few years and I used to snap my PL every 30 minutes. And FX is very busy when London's in and then it tends to fizzle after that. So 7am or really like 6am New York till 11am is like the good time to trade FX. And like everyone knows that and you know I knew that I probably shouldn't trade in the afternoon. But then I started snapping my PL every 30 minutes. And basically like if you just normalize it to like maximum PL like this is starting PL then that's maximum. The maximum was at 11 and then I was losing between 11 and 5pm. I was losing about 35 of my PL like on average. So like yeah I knew that afternoons weren't great to trade. But then when I saw that I'm like that's like a lot of money you know you know you had a percentage at a hedge fund. So that's like real money that's you know it registered for the first time in my mind like okay I really have to like pretty much square up at 11 or like reduce my position, reduce my risk to 20 of what it was or whatever.

But whatever data people can keep like a journal like in is generally people think of a trading journal as like words and thoughts and all that. But also like keeping like I got in at this time out at this time depends on your frequency like if you're doing 200 trades a day then that's not realistic and then your data has to be on a like your granularity has to be daily levels. But if you're doing like four trades a day you can keep track pretty specifically and then you can start to see and you can start to get information about like oh whenever I do options beyond a month. Like so that's one one thing I started noticing was like I used to do a lot of options that were pretty short. And I noticed like one week options at the end of the year one week options were making me a lot of money and overnight options were were killing like we're super negative.

Well the same thing in equities right as you as you get to like the stupid short time horizons nobody wants to sell that thing because the leverage is too crazy. So if you're systematically buying those things you're losing money. So I would just encourage your your peeps to just keep as detailed as as within reason. Yeah. And so the interesting thing is like just sit there and collect it for three months. And then after three months or whatever go look at it and go like okay what you know what can I learn here you don't have to constantly be checking back on it like most of my trick most of my data I just have it in a sheet and like I look at it once a quarter and I go because especially now I kind of know what it's going to say.

Well and I feel like there's a ton of value in that. I actually do a segment right now it's called teaching to trade. I like took four random people from my audience and we meet each week and we record sessions together essentially just about like learning our skillset together. Okay. And one of the big things is trade logs. I'm a huge advocate of trade documentation and especially when I think people are early on in their journey it even starts to give you information in terms of like what's important to track. And then over time you can cut out thing like you know for options. I originally tracked all of the first order and second order Greeks. Super overkill did not need to happen and I don't do that anymore but now I know that if I'm trading you know two week options row doesn't really matter that much however for really long term stuff especially during a year like this when interest rates are moving rows now important and we know that you know from reviewing that kind of data.

I my my mate like I have two books about my first one's just about FX trading and my second one's more about trading in general but in the first couple chapters of that book I kind of go into like success rates and like what it takes to succeed and all that kind of stuff in trading and the the thing about trading is that it's like online poker or like professional poker like anyone can go sit down right but like I think it's really important to understand like not necessarily on day one like nobody has an edge on day one.

If that was a thing first of all like that it isn't a thing but if it was there be computers doing it and there are computers doing it you know so like the simplest the very simplest things don't exist as profitable like alpha generating strategies.
