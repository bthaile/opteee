So we were just talking a little bit about your background and whatnot, but first, you know, I'd love to just welcome you to the channel. Thank you so much for taking some time to chat with me and in the audience. We really relish specifically these kind of opportunities because folks like you with your kind of experience, like I was saying, I think it's just. It's monumental for other people to try to pull as much of that as we can because, you know, like I said, I started trading in 2007 and I know what I know, which is a snapshot really it's. So I'm really looking forward to just discussing a little bit about, you know, what you've seen over your, your years and get some ideas on what you're thinking looking forward.

Well, we called hearts and flowers back then, but liberal arts and things just, just taking something to stay in college, but I knew for whatever reason I knew from early on that I was interested in finance and did undergrad finance and MBA with the finance background. While I was working in a bank, I started right out of college in a small bank investment department.

We had statewide banks and in some states like Indiana, it was county wise and you couldn't, you couldn't go outside your county. So we had several branches in the county. We were the largest bank in the county. So in a lot of ways you accumulated talent in these small banks that you wouldn't today.

My boss was, I think 30 at the time. So it was relatively young, but he'd come out of an Indianapolis bank and he was pretty progressive.

And then you know, he'd have me work on portfolios, etc. The other thing I got, as I said, I was doing trust, which is, you know, customer portfolios, but also bank portfolio, which is mostly bonds, mostly government bonds. And I was also sitting on an asset liability committee, which was made up of my boss, the, you know, the head of the bank, the controller, the bank and maybe one other person.

So then you talked about going to kind of getting into like pension management.

Yeah, yeah, it's one of the reasons why I asked that question is because I think there's a like quite a few bankers that follow my channel a little bit now. And I know a lot of them have a very mixed relationship when they have any sort of interaction with bonds, especially today. You know, it's a very, very different world, I think, you know, compared to what bonds were doing, you know, 70s and 80s. So I, it seems like equities was a lot riskier for you, but that seemed to drive you a little bit. Is that is that probably fair. Equities in general tend to have higher risk attached to them. I don't know that I gave it that much thought it was really just, you know, I had learned both bonds side and equity side and kind of said, this is the side I like better. So, you know, there's, there's probably more variety of what you have to do within that. I mean, bond, bond guys have a lot on their plate too. So, you know, I'm certainly very happy.

It just seems like a very interesting dialogue to have with somebody, you know, when you're coming with a pretty big ask that is counter to their, you know, typical way of doing business.

And so it became a very narrowly focused market of 50 stocks. And then when the, when the recession came when the bear market came, they crashed, I mean, they went down strong big.

That's why that's why they were taught, you know, equities are a bad thing. Right.

So, so that's why they and from that point forward from the mid 70s till I came in, the idea was, will, will get returns for private placements and through bonds and things that are more stable. They did very well. They were taught for tile doing that because you know, text run was kind of that way with their private, you know, their company purchases and things. So they were just kind of following the culture that they were used to. So I was a step out of that, you know, I was coming in and being very opposite to that culture.

The reason why I'm really curious about the conversation obviously is just that event in and of itself is interesting to me, but I do feel like there are some tenants of that that we see now when we're talking about cryptocurrencies coming online and a lot of, you know, places are super resistant, you know, to the idea of that kind of, you know, technology and whatnot. And it's just fascinating to me how like some of those kind of tendencies can just repeat over time. Obviously different, different overall scenarios, but nonetheless, I've, I just draw parallel between those two when I think about them. The other question I had just on your experience while while you were still there was you said that you took them to about 50 in equities. Do you know how to curiosity, like when you left to your next gig. Did they maintain that kind of allocation? Did they, you know, as an institution, change their approach or did they go back to being a little more conservative. Yeah, I wouldn't talk out of school except",

That it's yeah, I mean, it makes so much sense and it feels like traders, we hear that from so many different places and you know folks that follow the markets and then, you know, there it is everybody's there with like their technical analysis, which is all historic in nature, you know, it's just it's historic. It's historic and it's typically momentum driven. Yep, so if you're if you're an inflection point, that's the last thing you want to do is go with the momentum because it's going to reverse right. Yeah, that's that that's. I don't know, I look at that and it sounds it's those are the kinds of things that in hindsight, it's like, yeah, that's the obvious move, but I feel like what people don't capture when people like you say those things is just the amount of conviction you had to have to actually be a contrarian to actually do something that everybody else was kind of nervous to do. Again, just from like a personal perspective, I would be really curious to just dive into that a little bit more to understand, you know, the the concept behind looking forward, projecting, you know, in terms of your best assessments where the market is going, not where it's been. But how do you reconcile with yourself in making those decisions when you look left and look right",

And it was a book called, at that time it was called the psychology of the stock market by David Dream, David Dream and it been a forms columnist, you know, syndicated forms columnist, but he has written many, you know, it's been revised many times. And the first revision is maybe 1998 and it's called contrary and investment strategies now. So it's a different title, but I, and I only read the original, but I think it's pretty much same book. And I recommend that any investor, particularly any retail investor. And really, he does a very good job of explaining this, how much psychology plays a role in investing and in stock market.

And you mentioned that book because that's that's actually one that I meant to our spoke about a little bit and it's the original version. I actually didn't know that it that it was revised into the contrary and investment strategies. I, I got to check that one out because he used to share, you know, pieces of the older version with me, but I actually be really curious to see how it's, you know, evolved over time because I think a lot of, I don't know, even the nature of being a contrary and I feel like his changed over time. And with how far you take the concept of being a contrary and so that's, I'm glad you mentioned that book. Thank you. So I definitely will check that one out.

So something that a few of the folks for my audience are like, really curious about is obviously last year with COVID and all that super unique scenario that that we experienced. throughout this year in a lot of ways, it seemed, at least for me, a bit of an anomaly in certain instances, but I'd love to start to just get an understanding of how you view the markets in 2020, looking back at the whole year. What did you see that you were like, that kind of stood out to you? Yeah, I came into 2020 with a view that we were gonna have a meltup, probably first half of 2020, and then global bust, and a big bear market. In February, I said,",

In February, I said, if you remember, the market was moving up and up and up, and I kept saying it's gonna come down and people started picking on me because I was for weeks, and I think we're near the top, it should roll over and it kept going higher. And they said, no, your meltup is happening now, and I said, no, I just, there's too many people on the bandwagon right now. So in February, I was talking about a 10 correction, and then we got the 10 correction from whatever it was, 3,300 down to the 3,000, or slightly under, is what I was looking for. And I go, great, I look great. This is exactly what I called, you know, and I was, you know, unbeknownst to me that turned into a 30 or 35 correction. So I don't claim credit, because I thought 10 were all we're gonna get, or maybe a little more than that.

So I said, no, it looks like all we're getting here, what's the market likes to do, is it to fake down, that's a fake breakdown. And so when almost the entire street was calling for lower, like into the teens on the SP, I said, this is the bottom, 2200. And I am sticking with my meltup target of something over 4,000 this year. So I expected we were gonna go from 2200 back up and see something over 4,000, maybe before the end of 2020. It obviously took longer. But I raised my, I think I had a 4200 target on the SP. I then raised that to 4,500. Then I raised it again, this is over the course of the last 18 months to 47 in the 800. And right now I'm at, and then 5,000, right now",

And I called this a 39 year secular bull market top. In other words, we started the bull market in August 1982, but I was talking about when I was a tech run. Yeah, that was the beginning of this secular bull market. We've had cyclical bull markets through many cycles here. But the full secular move started in August of 1982. And I think we'll end in 2022.

So something I'm curious. Oh, sorry, go ahead. Yeah, so what happens at the end of a big cycle, not a cycle like 2009 to now, but a big secular move. What happens is as you move towards the end of that, you go parabolic. So the smoke gets steeper and steeper. And that's the last leg of this bull market, if I'm correct, is going to be almost vertical. So you will cover, I think, a move from, let's say, we're around 4500 now on the SP. Let's say we move up to 5500. I think you'll cover that ground. That's 1,000 points. In somewhere between three and six months. And I'm thinking it may be closer to three than six. What role do you think this is a little bit of a sidestep? I want to come back to this conversation, but I just, something I'm really curious about for folks like you, what role do you see retail traders playing in the overall market development? And I say that because I've been reading a bunch of white papers that talks about the advent of things, like game of fine trading or game of fine stock buying apps like Robinhood. And some folks are speculating that with the just significant influx of retail",

    "text": "overall market development? And I say that because I've been reading a bunch of white papers that talks about the advent of things, like game of fine trading or game of fine stock buying apps like Robinhood. And some folks are speculating that with the just significant influx of retail trader money as a whole, obviously, a lot of retail traders as individuals don't really count for much. But as an entire group, they start to matter, you know, at least a little bit. Do you think that that affects your projections in terms of the market movement? Or do you think that, you know, they're kind of just along for the ride and the market is still going to continue to move based off of just those bigger volume and bigger-sized trades, you know, institutions, hedge funds, things like that? Yeah. So my view is as a contrarian, one reason I'm a contrarian, probably a primary reason is that at bottoms in markets, whether you're talking stock, sir, Vaughan, or what have you, at bottoms, the vast majority of people are bearish, right? At tops, the vast majority of people are bullish, are bulls. So I just view what's going on in the retail market with Robinhood and the MEMS, et cetera, or the MEMS stocks, et cetera, it's just a sign of how far along we are in the secular bull market. It's just, you know, it's more symptomatic of where we're at, for a long time, investors",

So for much of the last 10 years, we've had pundits trying to call tops, you know, saying we're at a top. And the retail public was probably because it would happen in 2008-09 and a lot of things that have happened since, but they were skeptical and didn't want to commit money. So they had money market funds have grown to huge amounts. And a lot of people were in bonds and not in stocks or were very, you know, lightly invested in stocks. And in the last year, you've had that change where the retail public is coming into the market because it just became too obvious that they were missing something. So I do that as a more of a sign that we're getting near the top, rather than, you know, a driving element of the top. That's a really, really interesting perspective on that.

I mean, you pretty much have to go into equities in some capacities. If you're doing anything else, you know, you're bleeding maybe a little more slowly, but inflation is kind of killing you. So that's a really interesting way to look at that. Speaking of inflation, and I know that we're coming up on time, so I have a few more questions if you have, you know, if you have a few minutes, there's a couple others I had for you. How do you view inflation right now and just the Fed's approach to managing it? So we talked a little earlier, you know, about starting to hint towards maybe tightening policy a little bit, but just curious your thoughts on that. Yeah, my view is we printed so much money and there's a lag to when that money has an impact on inflation. So, you know, and we print a lot of money in QE1 and QE2 and QE3, but this last thing since March 2020 is off the charts. I mean, we've never, you know, the Fed balance",

And most of that 8.5 trillion, more than half of it has occurred in the last 18 months. You know, they went from 3.7 to 8.5. Right. And it's way to 10. So, so that money with a lag does create inflation. And I think that's what we're seeing. Inflation is breaking out for the first time in, you know, 30 or 40 years. After ratcheting down from that early 1980s high and going from 20 inflation down to almost zero, we're now back up at talking about 6 numbers. And obviously, and my belief is that we're going to accelerate from here that we're probably not done. Even though the Fed's talking about taper and probably is going to taper, inflation doesn't react to tightening quickly. It, you know, that you've kind of built in some momentum here. So I expect over the course of the next six months, inflation to go higher. And I will keep the Fed saying, yeah, we've got to do more.

And I define a bust as opposed to recession as something that's maybe almost as bad as a depression and some, some magnitude, but happens at the speed of a recession. So it's not drawn out like the great depression was over a decade. It's something where you'll have the damage of the recession. The damage of, you know, we used the term great recession for 2008-09. I'd say the bust is something greater than the great, great recession, but not the length of a great depression. So, so in other words, we're looking at, in my opinion, the downturn here when it comes has a potential to be the worst in the post-war war two era and the worst since the great depression. So, you know, something pretty bad. And what happened relatively fast and the reason I think we get there is we have 300, I used to say to earn 50, but we have 300 trillion in global debt.

Nobody can, if you ask anybody, nobody could really give you a hand and have a handle on what a trillion dollars is. Right. And yet we're at 300 trillion global debt. We're at quadrillions in terms of the social value of derivatives. Those are both debt and derivatives are both forms of leverage. Right. One's leverage on markets, one's leverage on the economy, but leverage works both ways. It enhances returns on the way up. It really destroys returns on the way down and it exacerbates things. So my thing is that what would normally be a recession turns into something far worse because of we've never been here before. We've never had leverage like this. Not even in 2008-19. We're not even close to those levels. We're way beyond those levels. And we've not had a downturn since 2009 to test what happens with this kind of leverage. So very simply, I think what might have been a normal recession turns into something far steeper and worse. But it happens fast because leverage on wind fast. And secondly, you've had a",

So what we have is an economy that's far more fragile because of the pandemic, coupled with an economy that's far more leveraged. When you combine that and then you tighten, you may find that it doesn't take much tightening to trigger a real big unwind. And that's my thesis anyway. That's my expectation. So I'm calling for a second half of 2022 for the bust. What role do you think? So something I saw, I think the financial times put out a just fascinating chart to me. And it was like showing a declining graphic essentially of on market volume. So meaning that there's a lot of trade volume starting to happen off exchange. So via dark pools and things like that. I'm curious, do you think, so I guess I'll give you my hypothesis on that.

I think that your expectations in terms of the decline, although based on probably a much broader amount of information than what I'm basing mine on, I have a similar conclusion to you in that there's likely a rapid unwind in the next 18 months. And one of the things I was thinking about that just made me feel like it was going to be something we hadn't seen before is just the amount of off exchange volume that is starting to be generated. Because I just feel like in those instances, whenever we've seen that happen before, when the unwind comes, it's typically just vicious because there is a ton of selling and then it starts going on market and off exchange almost simultaneously. I'm curious, do you have an opinion on just the movement of volume over time? Or do you think that the whole, like your whole projection is bigger than that concept? Yeah, I would look at it this way, which is that we've had since 2009, this onward, no, it's moved. And so you've had people accumulating stock spawns, derivatives, what have you all through the last, what is it, 11 years? So, and then you have an event that has that unwind get concentrated in a very short period of time. So yeah, I can certainly see where off market volume or off market activity has never",

So yeah, I can certainly see where off market volume or off market activity has never had nothing tested. And so it all becomes basically part of the ill liquidity that you see in a down graph like that. And what gives when you have ill liquidity is price. If you, if you, if everybody's on one side of the ship and they go to the other side of the ship, if everybody's moving as a crowd, it means you're not gonna have much on the other side of that trade to hold. And then price just caves. So I think we're set up because of the length of this steady, you know, yeah, we had March of 2020 by the last, you know, a month, three weeks. Yep. We've had some cell loss. We had December of 2018 or, you know, a few months prior to that. But, but really we've had this steadiness, steadily climbing higher and higher and higher. And then also when you have this, you know, this one, one time catch up move. And I think, you know, we've seen it in flash crashes. This is a flash crash. This is a bear market.

You know, you can, you can try to get as close to the top as you want, but just know the risk is if you stay in the party too long. You know, you can watch it all go away and I hurry and I, I think that's going to be the signature of the bear market. Is I think this bear market, not, I don't use it word crash because I think that implies things happen like in a matter of days. Right. I'm not confident that it's going to be a bear market over a matter of months, maybe, you know, I don't know whether it'll be four months, six months, eight months, 12 months, but it'll happen over a period of time. And there won't be a straight line. There'll be, there'll be a bear market rally in there, et cetera. Pretty confident saying all that, but some of those steps down could be, you know, you could lose 30 in a week. Right. And, and so those that say, I'm going to ride this and they get caught up in the fundamentals or get caught up in the, the recommendations that'll be there at the top. And then miss the top. May, may say, GY, they get greedy after the fact. So, so you got to kind of be, you know, I can't give advice and I don't have advice",

So when you talk about sentiment and like monitoring sentiment, what are some of the ways you do that. Well, probably the one seat of the pants one is on Twitter. I know when I'm in pretty good shape, when I'm getting a lot of people call me, you know, a tool or a fool. So, no shortage of criticism on the internet. I can give you an example because I've been calling for I'm probably baseball on gold and silver on the on the market on the street.

And there are setups that say this thing could go very, very strongly in the next several months. So, but, you know, it sold off in the last two weeks after having a nice run in October. And the early November, it's it's been basically selling off. And I saw that coming by and see it coming quite to this extent. Right.

    "text": "happen with the bust, it's not a straight line. That's what I talk about that with commodity. I go, the next cycle is going to be all commodities. And so yes, we've broken out here, but you've got to, you've got a bust to be between this commodity run here and the big commodity run that will follow the bust because I'm predicting 400 oil now the end of the decade. So, but before we get there in the bust, I think oil can go back into the 20s. So you will go from 20 to 425 to 400 in, you know, seven or eight years. As I say to people who talk about a commodity super cycle, just be careful. It's like standing on the south rim of the Grand Canyon, looking across to the north rim and thinking you can walk straight across. You know, you've got that canyon in between, in this case, a bust that means yes, you'll have a big commodity cycle, but it's not straight from here. Right. Man, that's a super fun part of the conversation. I literally could just keep going on that. So I did promise after I lied to you the first time that the last one was actually the last question. So I will shut up here. But like I said, this is, I love these sessions so much, especially with folks like you that have experienced what you've experienced and you know, you take the time to share",

Literally cannot thank you enough for taking the time to connect with us. So first, you know, from that perspective, thank you personally very much. It's really interesting hearing about your experience. I love just learning about your background, you know, what you've seen before. Definitely have a laundry list of more questions, but I'll have to, you know, bug you some future time to see if I can get you back on. But out of curiosity, you know, would love to hear, you know, how people can find you. I know that you're on Twitter. That's why I found you. I follow you on there. But, you know, what's your Twitter handle and what other ways can people reach out to you? Sure. Yeah, I'm on Twitter most every day. So you can reach me there at Dave H. Contrarian. And be careful there's, there's some phony accounts out there that change the spelling of contrarian. And so there's a lot of kind of dummy accounts out there to try to pretend they're me. They'll have my profile picture and stuff. So make sure it's Dave H. Contrarian spelled",

Well, what I could do for that is I'll just in the video description. I'll throw the link to it so that they can go. Great. Yeah, that'd be great. And then I do write a quarterly letter macro letter. So if anybody is by subscription, you know, there's a manual fee to it. So if anybody's interested, they can direct message me on Twitter and I'll get right back to them. Awesome. Well, like I said, thank you so much. I like sincerely enjoy this ton and I would love, you know, to do another session with you in the future. Sure. Yeah, we'll come back maybe in six months and see how wrong I was. No. Well, it's like I tell my audience all the time, you know, if you want to make a bunch of money, just do the opposite of what I do. And then you'll be all right. Exactly. Awesome. Thank you.
