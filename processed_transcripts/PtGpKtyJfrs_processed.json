What is it over 40 years now? Yeah, it's 48 years. So coming up on 50. That's a, that's a big end of. I'm not the old geezers out there. That's a, that's a big milestone, but. So we were just talking a little bit about your background and whatnot, but first, you know, I'd love to just welcome you to the channel. Thank you so much for taking some time to chat with me and in the audience. We really relish specifically these kind of opportunities because folks like you with your kind of experience, like I was saying, I think it's just. It's monumental for other people to try to pull as much of that as we can because, you know, like I said, I started trading in 2007 and I know what I know, which is a snapshot really it's. So I'm really looking forward to just discussing a little bit about, you know, what you've seen over your, your years and get some ideas on what you're thinking looking forward. So first, like I said, welcome to the channel and I would love to just start with a little bit about your background, you know, were you started in just your macro level view of things and, you know, your",

Sure, thanks Eric, thanks for having me on. Yeah, I, I'm not to not to get too caught up in the, you know, the beginnings of this, but I did start as a finance major in college back in, you know, I entered college in 69 so that was Vietnam years and as I joke, you know, hardly anybody was a business major back then people were trying to avoid the draft and most of more. Well, we called hearts and flowers back then, but liberal arts and things just, just taking something to stay in college, but I knew for whatever reason I knew from early on that I was interested in finance and did undergrad finance and MBA with the finance background. While I was working in a bank, I started right out of college in a small bank investment department. So I had I really attribute a lot of my success to that really because I was part of it basically a two man investment bank investment operation where I got to manage bank portfolio as well as trust portfolio seven and I got exposure bonds and stocks.

You know, if you go to a bigger place, you usually have to specialize in one or the other. So there was a lot there that gave me kind of access to macro. And then I went to another bank, bigger bank, where I had to choose and I want to trust department because I wanted to do stocks. And in about four years got recruited away or applied for a job as equity pension manager for a fortune 100 company. And that kind of really jumped started the career where I was a sole equity manager within an in house, you know, within the corporation, they managed their pension assets in house. So they had somebody that two people doing private placement, they had a couple of people doing bonds and they had me doing equities and it really gave me again the ability to kind of be on my own not be part of a big team or anything.

He had left by the time I got there and was, you know, Fed chairman, but his legend, he was a very well thought of CEO and really was text from being conglomerate, they were kind of, you know, the rent house stuff was very much private place in Oregon because that's what a conglomerate doesn't buy, you know, assets. So I heard all through when I was recruited, they had very little equity. And then they missed the 1980 oil market so they dropped from a top portal investor down to mid court to L. And so they brought me in, I was counseled by all kinds of people on the streets saying it's a dead end.

I look back now and wonder how they ever believed that, but I'd have to go to meetings and, you know, kind of piece by piece sell them because they had 10 of their assets and equities and most of those equities when I came in were almost private placement, you know, small. You know, not heavily traded stocks. And in the five years I was there, I had top percentile performance, the whole five years, I took them from 10 of their assets, equities to 50 because of the performance.

And then, in the thumbnail, it's still far more any far more than any experience I can drum up. So I actually wrote a bunch of questions down just from that that I'd love to just tie into a couple of them. So the first one of the first things you mentioned was, you know, like your post college small bank experience. To me, it seems like there's a lot of value. It almost seems like a startup experience where, you know, you're, you're brought in and you end up doing a lot of things at once. While you were doing different things that, you know, like you said, you were trading looking over, you know, some of the different allocations things like that. What was your interest at that point when you were at the small bank and why, like what did you like working on the most? Yeah, well, it was all investment. You know, it was the, this was in Indiana and Indiana at the time had branching couldn't go beyond county. So this was before, before your time, you",

You know, it was the, this was in Indiana and Indiana at the time had branching couldn't go beyond county. So this was before, before your time, you know, we never had nationwide banks. We had statewide banks and in some states like Indiana, it was county wise and you couldn't, you couldn't go outside your county. So we had several branches in the county. We were the largest bank in the county. So in a lot of ways you accumulated talent in these small banks that you wouldn't today. You know, today's, today's branches of the big banks, you basically have, you know, people that are following formulas, you know, if you're going to make a loan, you're going to follow formulas, whatever. So I felt very fortunate. This was a fairly progressive bank that had some pretty good talent that came out of bigger city banks to, you know, go out away from the cities and run, runs up themselves. My boss was, I think 30 at the time. So it was relatively young, but he'd come out of an Indianapolis bank and he was pretty progressive. In fact, he helped write some law in Indiana, where state, where county treasurers and town treasurers could do repose, repurchase agreements with the bank and earn higher returns and they could get through normal investments in bonds or",

And so he kind of created that for the state. And so I was learning that his kind of his side. And then you know, he'd have me work on portfolios, etc. The other thing I got, as I said, I was doing trust, which is, you know, customer portfolios, but also bank portfolio, which is mostly bonds, mostly government bonds. And I was also sitting on an asset liability committee, which was made up of my boss, the, you know, the head of the bank, the controller, the bank and maybe one other person. But so I was able to kind of understand things that people in bigger banks would never see until they were 10 or 15 years into the business. And so when I went to a large bank that was pretty interesting, because I chose to go the trust side, but I'd still talk to the bank people and they were surprised at, you know, the knowledge I had, you know, five years into the business.

And it's for a very similar reason, because you get to learn how the organization works as a whole, you get some, you know, specific experience with where you are and then as you rotate out. Yeah, when you were mentioning that small bank experience early on, like it's just funny to me, because that to, it seems like that sends you on a very different trajectory than if you went to a big bank, you got really good at one specific thing. So then you talked about going to kind of getting into like pension management. I'm just curious what drew you in that direction as compared to, you know, whatever other moves were available, I assume they were numerous in nature, what would sent you that way.

And I had enough confidence in myself by that, but in the best even though it was my 20 on your old, I've been in the best eight years and I was pretty comfortable as a value manager, if that's kind of how I gravitated that I could manage money conservatively and perform well and you know, was a pretty good stock picker, etc. It was that that, and you know, I was still in a bank that wasn't necessarily given me a fast track. So it gave me the opportunity to get to somewhere where I felt I could, you know, fast track more. And it really worked out in space just because I hit the ground running.

But again, the, the portfolios 50 million at the time. And I may have asked for another 50 and they gave me 25 or we may have asked for more and they gave me half of that.

From 500 million dollar pension fund to a billion dollar pension fund. So I end up going from 50 to 500 million in equities. And, and I was it.

Yeah, yeah, it's one of the reasons why I asked that question is because I think there's a like quite a few bankers that follow my channel a little bit now. And I know a lot of them have a very mixed relationship when they have any sort of interaction with bonds, especially today. You know, it's a very, very different world, I think, you know, compared to what bonds were doing, you know, 70s and 80s. So I, it seems like equities was a lot riskier for you, but that seemed to drive you a little bit. Is that is that probably fair. Equities in general tend to have higher risk attached to them. I don't know that I gave it that much thought it was really just, you know, I had learned both bonds side and equity side and kind of said, this is the side I like better. So, you know, there's, there's probably more variety of what you have to do within that. I mean, bond, bond guys have a lot on their plate too. So, you know, I'm certainly very happy.

So, you know, I'm certainly very happy. I went the direction. I did. Right. And then just another, this one's kind of a personal question for me, because it's something I probably will never experience though. What was your relationship and what were the interactions with the investment committee like. So you gave a little overview of just a little bit of, you know, how they were kind of used and used to and set in their ways in terms of how they normally conduct business. You were able to persuade them a little bit to take a little. You know, different direction. I'm just curious in general, what were those interactions like with the committee, were they agreeable while you were discussing with them, where they eager, where they kind of shut off, but then I read. It just seems like a very interesting dialogue to have with somebody, you know, when you're coming with a pretty big ask that is counter to their, you know, typical way of doing business. I should preface that by saying that the money was pulled in house back in the mid 70s, after the 74 bear market, which was worse bear market we had had since the, you know, the 20th I'm crashed.

So, you know, 74 into 75 was pretty awful and G William Miller was chairman at the time and he pulled all the money at that time. Most pension money was managed by the big New York banks, you know, Chase Manhattan, and JP Morgan and city city, city corporate, et cetera. And it was all concentrated in New York. And it got into the 50 50, you know, the market in the peak in 73 was known as the nifty 50 because it was 50 pretty much 50 big stocks, IBM, general motors, et cetera, at the time. And they became known as one decision stocks, which, you know, all the portfolio managers in New York to work for these banks would all go the same lunch and buy the same stocks. And so it became a very narrowly focused market of 50 stocks. And then when the, when the recession came when the bear market came, they crashed, I mean, they went down strong big.

And never again, do I want to approach some of my executives that are very close to retirement and tell them that they lost half their pension assets, you know, retirement time. So, so that's why they and from that point forward from the mid 70s till I came in, the idea was, will, will get returns for private placements and through bonds and things that are more stable. They did very well. They were taught for tile doing that because you know, text run was kind of that way with their private, you know, their company purchases and things.

The reason why I'm really curious about the conversation obviously is just that event in and of itself is interesting to me, but I do feel like there are some tenants of that that we see now when we're talking about cryptocurrencies coming online and a lot of, you know, places are super resistant, you know, to the idea of that kind of, you know, technology and whatnot. And it's just fascinating to me how like some of those kind of tendencies can just repeat over time. Obviously different, different overall scenarios, but nonetheless, I've, I just draw parallel between those two when I think about them. The other question I had just on your experience while while you were still there was you said that you took them to about 50 in equities.

I can interestingly part of my success there, like I said, I had, if you look at the style boxes or you look at the performance boxes, you know, you have the four quartiles and it was the SEI pension fund equity, pension fund universe. I was compared against pretty much the pension fund universe in the country. And if you look at the boxes, I was outside the top four tiles outside top percentile, I was, you know, we appear and, and so part of the way I did that and I wasn't necessarily the strategy was the web rip, but I wasn't doing performance reasons other than that was what I thought we should do. And the, in the early 80s inflation peak, the oil peak. And I, and I think this is where so much, you know, all the way out to now 40 years later, I see the same mistakes being made by money managers is they tend to manage looking backwards.

And we, you know, oil was the darling on the street. So all the portfolios across Wall Street were loaded with oil 30, 30, 35 of the SP was energy, and particularly oil. And I had zero weighting in oil. I basically said, if you're looking backwards, yes, that's where you want to be. If you're looking forward, we're basically at the peak point in inflation. That point was 20 or what had been in 1981. So I said, you know, where most managers were saying we need inflation at stocks. I said, we're at the maximum point for inflation. Everything going forward, the rate of change, you know, the forward looking change is going to be away from inflation, even though you're going to go maybe from 2018 and then 18 to 16, you know, so you're still getting high inflation, you're moving on a rate of change basis away from inflation.

And so I said, what you want to own, if this is the peak of inflation, is you want to own those things that got beat up by inflation. So that means gross stocks. That means, you know, particularly the consumer gross stock. I was buying Coca-Cola at book value, I was buying Warner Lambert, which was a big drug company at book value, I was buying Merck at book value, I was buying, I'm trying to think of some of the other names I had, but they were basically, carnation was one, just a food company. They were things that were really flat on their butts, because inflation had really damages them. And, but I was looking at what was going to happen going forward. And that two things really helped my portfolio, one was I didn't have the things that became laggard so the things that were dragging down other portfolios, meaning energy, you know, that had peaked and was now over a long period of time that would be distributed.

I had a pretty strong macro background, so I had that part of it where I looked at the Fed said they're very committed to inflation, winding out inflation, not quickly, but you know, over time.

And so that's a logical way. And, you know, a big disjointed function of that is the fact that, you know, the markets really aren't rational all the time.

And a lot of even professionals, I think forget is the stock market or any market is a discounting mechanism. So it's discounting things way ahead of the time that it occurs, the stock market in particular will be this kind of things sometimes six months out. And yet the way people think and it's helped along by the CNBCs of the world is they think that market movement is based on today's new. So because every day they get a some, you know, they get a summation of what happened today and they always tell you the reason why happened. Except in, you know, in the, in the scheme of things in the longer scheme of things. What's going on in the market today, maybe discounting what's going to happen, you know, three to six months out. Because there are lots of things you can, lots of factors you can look at. What we call.

Can you explain to me. Why, you know, Paul's telling us he's going to accelerate taper and do double the taper and and the tightening is going to come sooner. Why did interest rates go down on that? You know, they can't quite fathom. You know, I thought if he's tightening rates are going up, but I said no, it's, you know, it's a couple of things, but it's, it's the street looking at the fact that if he's tightening, he may actually slow the economy. And that's, you know, going to help bonds and you can slow inflation. And secondly, his actions are hitting the start market, you know, his comments. And so it's, you know, basically it's a, they're dividing bonds as a safety, you know, they're looking at a risk of risk of. Sometimes you have to kind of look further than what's obvious.

Can I have those books? Can you give me a list of books? And I go, I only recommend basically one book. And I was at 1977, I was already contrary and at that time, but it really resonated with me that it spoke my language. And it was a book called, at that time it was called the psychology of the stock market by David Dream, David Dream and it been a forms columnist, you know, syndicated forms columnist, but he has written many, you know, it's been revised many times. And the first revision is maybe 1998 and it's called contrary and investment strategies now. So it's a different title, but I, and I only read the original, but I think it's pretty much same book. And I recommend that any investor, particularly any retail investor. And really, he does a very good job of explaining this, how much psychology plays a role in investing and in stock market.

And, and I, I am sticking with my meltup target of something over 4000 this year. So I expected we were going to go from 2200 back up and see something over 4000 maybe before the end of 2020. It obviously took longer. But I, I raised my, I think I had a 4200, I'll, 4200 target on the SP. I, uh, then raised that to 4500. Then I raised it again.

Sorry, I was just, I was just throwing up a chart so everybody could kind of follow along some of the prices that you're saying it makes it a little easier. Sure. Yeah. So, so from that 2200 back in March where you see the waterfall cascade down there, um, yeah, I expected that over the course of the next six to 12 months, we'd get up over 4000 of maybe 4200. As we progressed through, it became obvious to me, particularly with all the money that was being thrown into the system and all the fiscal expansion that this thing had more legs than that. So I raised it 4500. Um, and I did these, I didn't do it when we got there. I probably raised it 4500 before we got to 4000. And then I raised it to 5,000 before we got to 4300, I think.

But a big secular move, what happens is as you move towards the end of that, you, you go parabolic. So the smoke gets steeper and steeper. And that's the last leg of this bull market, if I'm correct, is going to be almost vertical. So you will cover, I think, a move from, let's say, we're, you know, we're around 4500 now on the SP. Let's say we move up to 5500. I think you'll cover that ground. That's a thousand points. And somewhere between three and six months, and maybe, and I'm thinking it may be closer to three than six.

And some folks are speculating that with the just significant influx of retail trader money as a whole, obviously, a lot of retail traders as individuals don't really, you know, count for much. But as an entire group, they start to matter, you know, at least a little bit. Do you think that that affects your projections in terms of the market movement? Or do you think that, you know, they're kind of just along for the ride and the market is still going to continue to move based off of just those bigger volume and bigger-sized trades, you know, institutions, hedge funds, things like that. Yeah, so my view is as a contrary and one reason I'm a contrary and probably a primary reason is that at bottoms-in markets, whether you're talking stocks or bond or what have you, at bottoms, the vast majority of people are bearish, right?

It's just, you know, it's more symptomatic of where we're at. You know, for a long time, investors were skeptical and were bearish. So for much of the last 10 years, we've had pundits trying to call tops, you know, saying we're at a top. And the retail public was probably because it happened in 2008-09 and a lot of things that have happened since, but they were skeptical and didn't want to commit money. So you had, you know, money market funds have grown to huge amounts and a lot of people were in bonds and not in stocks or were very, you know, lightly invested in stocks. And in the last year, you've had that change where the retail public is coming into the market because it just became too obvious that they were missing something.

I literally hadn't thought about it that way, but that seriously makes the ton of sense because if there's enough of a draw for those folks that go on off of your previous comments on, you know, the parabolic nature of things, especially it's so difficult to get a like, with inflation word is at least right now, to get like a positive real rate of return. I mean, you pretty much have to go into equities in some capacities. If you're doing anything else, you know, you're bleeding maybe a little more slowly, but inflation is kind of killing you. So that's a really interesting way to look at that. Speaking of inflation, and I know that we're coming up on time. So I have a few more questions if you have, you know, if you have a few minutes, there's a couple others I had for you. How do you view inflation right now and just the Fed's approach to managing it?

So we talked a little earlier, you know, about starting to hint towards maybe tightening policy a little bit, but just curious your thoughts on that. Yeah, my view is we printed so much money, and there's a lag to when that money has an impact on inflation. So, you know, and we print a lot of money in QE1 and QE2 and QE3, but this last thing since March 2020 is off the charts. I mean, we've never, you know, the balance, the Fed balance sheet in October of 2008 was 875 billion. Today we're at eight and a half trillion. Yep. And most of that eight and a half trillion, more than half of it has occurred in the last 18 months. You know, they went from three seven to eight and a half. Right. And it's way to, I know, it's way to 10. So, so that money with a lag does create inflation. And I think that's what we're seeing. The inflation is breaking out for the first time in, you know, 30 or 40 years. After ratcheting down from that early 1980s high and going from 20 inflation down to almost zero, we're now back up at talking about 6 numbers.

You know, that you've kind of built in some momentum here. So, I expect over the course of the next six months in inflation to go higher. And I will keep the Fed saying, yeah, we got to do more. So, so that's, I think what's going to lead to Fed tightening and what will lead to the end of this cycle and what will lead to what I am calling a global bust. And I define a bust as opposed to recession as something that's maybe almost as bad as a depression and some some magnitude, but happens at the speed of a recession. So, it's not drawn out like the Great Depression was over a decade. It's something where you'll have the damage of, you know, we used the term Great Recession for 2008, nine. I'd say the bust is something greater than the Great Great Recession, but not the length of a Great Depression. So, so in other words, we're looking at in my opinion, the downturn here when it comes has a potential to be the worst in the post-war war two era and the worst",

So, you know, something pretty bad. And, but happened relatively fast. And the reason I think we get there is we have 300 and we I used to say 250, but we have 300 trillion in global debt. We went from 250 to 300 in just the last 18 months. So, we have 300 trillion in global debt. We're having trillions in the tens of numbers in the matter of a year. I mean, that's an incredible stuff. Nobody can, if you asked anybody, nobody could really give you a hand and have a handle on what a trillion dollars is. Right. And yet, we're at 300 trillion in global debt. We're at quadrillions in terms of the no-show value of derivatives. Those are both debt and derivatives are both forms of leverage. Right. One's leverage on markets, one's leverage on the economy, but leverage works both ways. It enhances returns on the way up. It really destroys returns on the way down and it exacerbates things. So, so my thing is that what would normally be a recession turns into something far worse because of we've never been here before. We've never had leverage like",

Not even in 2008-9, we're not even close to those levels. We're way beyond those levels. And we've not had a downturn since 2009 to test what happens with this kind of leverage. So very simply, I think, what might have been a normal recession turns into something far steeper and worse. But happens fast because leverage on wind fast. And secondly, you've had a pandemic unlike anything we've seen in our lifetimes. And that pandemic, I mean, good God, we had a shutdown of the entire global economy for a quarter or more. So what we have is an economy that's far more fragile because of the pandemic coupled with an economy that's far more leveraged. When you combine that and then you tighten, you may find that it doesn't take much tightening to trigger a real big unwind. And that's my thesis anyway. That's my expectation. So I'm calling for a second half of 2022 for the bust. What role do you think? So something I saw, I think the financial times put out a just fascinating chart to me.

So via dark pools and things like that. I'm curious. Do you think, so I guess I'll give you my hypothesis on that. I think that your expectations in terms of the decline, although based on probably a much broader amount of information than what I'm basing mine on, I have a similar conclusion to you in that there's likely a rapid unwind in the next 18 months. And one of the things I was thinking about that just made me feel like it was going to be something we hadn't seen before. It's just the amount of off exchange volume that is starting to be generated because I just feel like in those instances, whenever we've seen that happen before, when the unwind comes, it's typically just vicious because there is a ton of selling and then it starts going on market and off exchange almost simultaneously. I'm curious, do you have an opinion on just the movement of volume over time? Or do you think that the whole like your whole projection is bigger than that concept?

    "text": "then it starts going on market and off exchange almost simultaneously. I'm curious, do you have an opinion on just the movement of volume over time? Or do you think that the whole like your whole projection is bigger than that concept? Yeah, I would look at it this way, which is that we've had since 2009, this onward and onward move. And so you've had people accumulating stocks, bonds, derivatives. What have you all through the last 11 years? Then you have an event that has that unwind get concentrated in a very short period of time. So yeah, I can certainly see where off market volume or off market activity has never had nothing tested. So it all becomes basically part of the ill liquidity that you see in a down graph like that. And what gives when you have ill liquidity is price. If everyone's on one side of the ship and they go to the other side of the ship, if everybody's moving as a crowd, it means you're not going to have much on the other side of that trade to hold. And then price just caves. So I think we're set up because of the length of this study. Yeah, we had March of 2020 by the last of a month, three weeks. We've had some sell-offs. We had December of 2018 or a few months prior to that. But really, we've had this steadiness steadily climbing higher and higher and higher. And then",

This isn't a flash crash. This is a bear market. But over the course of several months, I can see an 80 bear market. Interesting. That's interesting. Peak to trough. Yeah. Now, we haven't had a peak to trough market like that. I think we declined 60 in 2008-09 in the SP. 29, we had a 90 drop, 29-32. In 2000, the NASDAQ dropped, I think 80-90 but the whole market didn't, the SP didn't drop nearly much at all compared to that. This is going to be a global bear market where the whole globe is going to have big bear markets. Our 80, when I say 80, that's 80 in the SP, 80 in the NASDAQ, 80 across the board. It's not going to take very many prisoners. Right. I think your projection is interesting to me because I have, especially in 2022, I definitely was expecting a pullback, but a lot of the information you shared, even right now, has changed my thought on it a little bit just in terms of the severity.

You've already shared a lot of your thoughts on 2022. So that was one of the things I wanted to ask you. But if you were to bubble up, maybe the top two or three things that you are looking for, slash watching for 2022, what pieces of information, what, you know, sentiments are most important to you looking into the next year. I don't know. It really is watching how the investor evolves with the market. I mean, if the house sentiment evolves with the market, as you get to the point where you have universal view of a bull market, you know, the universal bullishness, that's when you want to start getting nervous. And, you know, everybody has to kind of choose their own point at which they, you know, they want to anticipate this.

But ultimately, the things I'm watching for for a top will be, I mean, obviously the fundamentals will be part of it. But more importantly, it's, it's a sentiment and the market movement itself. You know, when I say vertical, I really think this could be, has the potential to be quite stunning in terms of how much ground gets covered in a short time. And that, that becomes hard to resist. Yeah. You know, think about, think about a trade you made somewhere along the line where you were right, you got in, you were right on that trade. And then you said, but I don't want to be a pig.

I'm smiling because last year after the COVID drop, you know, I was like, ah, you know, it's just a lot of bad news and things like that. And most bear markets are, you know, like 250 days plus on average, something like that. And we definitely, you know, fallen into that. So I was like nibbling near the bottom. And then it just like just shot up. And I was like, what the hell just happened here? Like, it just, so that exact scenario happened to me last year. Yeah.

It's going to be a bear market over a matter of months. Maybe, you know, I don't know whether it'll be four months, six months, eight months, 12 months. But it'll happen over a period of time. And there won't be a straight line. There'll be, there'll be a bear market rally in there, et cetera. I'm pretty confident in saying all that.

But everybody has to kind of make that just the biggest thing they have to do is understand that we're in a later stage of this and that there is a pretty big downside that follows this. So, I told you I had that last question and I apologize because I lied to you. I've one very last question I promised this time. So, when you talk about sentiment and like monitoring sentiment, what are some of the ways you do that? Well, probably the one seat of the pants one is on Twitter. I know when I'm in pretty good shape, when I'm getting a lot of people call me a tool or a fool. So, no shortage of criticism on the internet. I can give you an example because I've been I've been calling for I'm probably baseball on gold and silver on the on the on the market on the street. And it peaked out last August, August of 2020. It came out of the March bottom and had a great run. I thought we'd have a few months of rest and then another big leg. Well, that few months has turned into 14 months, I think, 15",

But it's the asset out there that I love. And in terms of what it looks like, it's in my opinion, the most undervalued asset of all things out there right now. And there are setups that say this thing could go very, very strongly in the next several months. So, but it sold off in the last two weeks after having a nice run in October and the early November, it's been basically selling off. And I saw that coming by and see it coming quite to this extent. Right. And so now that it's just having the psychology effect on people, people that have been sitting in gold and silver over the miners, I feel a lot of pain and they just start, you know, getting angry. So that's once that's one side of sentiment is when you see, as I have said through 48 years, one thing that I feel I understand very well is sentiment.

I mean, you know, at the point, at the point, they're looking, it looks like it's never going to happen. Yeah, that's fair. It's, I'm actually one of those people. I'm pretty bearish gold right now. But again, like with your context, I can see why, I think one of the biggest arguments I see that's like bearish gold with inflation where it is right now is one part of the equation. But then also people are starting to conceive crypto currencies as like a better substitute to gold. I'm not there yet myself. I still think crypto currencies are just way too volatile to serve the purpose that gold does.

But I am not going to lie. I have been fading the crap out of it. As soon as I see it make a rally, I am hammering it. Yeah, my, my forecast for gold over the next six months is 2500. Really? My forecast for silver over the next six months is 50. So, so obviously I'm not bearish. Yeah, I was going to say I'm going to just pull this up real quick so everybody can see. So this is a six month daily on gold. So right now we're hanging like 1780ish. So you're thinking 25 sometime next year? Yep. That'll be, and I mean, if that pairs nicely with your expectation of the drawdown, that definitely seems within the round. Yeah, actually not. This is this is prior to the bus. Oh, interesting.

And then, and then following the bus because what what will happen in the bus? And I call this the most predictable part of my forecast or the easiest part to predict. We will see the the feds balance sheet grow from eight and a half trillion now. I wouldn't be surprised if it's certainly 20 trillion, maybe 30 trillion in response to the bus. Oh, got it. Yeah. So if you have that kind of money, you know, that's many times what we saw in the last 18 months, last 20 months. If you have that kind of money, it's going to jumpstart an inflation cycle. I fully expect us to retrace fully the last 40 years of inflation, disinflation slash deflation. So if we're in the bus, you could see a little bit of deflation. You could go from this inflation problem now and actually see a small bit of deflation, short deflation from there, let's say from 2023 to 2030. I expect we'll go from zero negative to 20 plus.

Even when people talk about inflation now, we're complaining about 6. You've already seen 20. You know what I mean? So it's just, yeah, I'm saying this is this is a many inflation cycle. Because of what's going to happen with the bus, it's not a straight line. That's what I talk about that with quality. The next cycle is going to be all commodities. And so yes, we've broken out here, but you've got you've got a bus to be between this commodity run here and the big commodity run that will follow the bus. Because I'm predicting 400 oil now the end of the decade. So, but before we get there in the bus, I think oil can go back into the 20s. So you",

So, but before we get there in the bus, I think oil can go back into the 20s. So you you will go from 20 to 425 to 400 in you know, seven or eight years. As I say to people who talk about a commodity super cycle, just be careful. It's like standing on the south rim of the Grand Canyon, looking across to the to the North Rim and thinking you can walk straight across. You know, you've got that canyon in between in this case of us. That means yes, you'll have a big commodity cycle, but it's not straight from here. Right. Right. Man, that that's a super fun part of the conversation. I literally could just keep going on that. So I did promise after I lied to you the first time that the that the last one was actually the last question. So I will I will shut up here. But I like like I said, this is I love these sessions so much, especially with folks like you that have experienced what you've experienced. And you know, you take the time to share it, you know, with people like me and my audience. Literally cannot thank you enough for taking the time to connect with us. So first, you know, from that perspective,",

It's it's really interesting hearing about your experience. I love just learning about your background, you know, what you've seen before. Definitely have a laundry list of more questions, but I'll have to, you know, bug you some future time to see if I can get you back on. But out of curiosity, you know, would love to hear, you know, how people can find you. I know that you're on Twitter. That's why I found you. I follow you on there. But, you know, what's your Twitter handle and what other ways can people reach out to you? Sure. Yeah. I'm on Twitter most every day. So you can reach me there at Dave H. Contra Aryan. And, and be careful. There's there's some phony accounts out there that change the spelling of contrarian. And so there's a lot of kind of dummy accounts out there to try to pretend they're me. They'll have my profile picture and stuff. So make sure it's Dave H. Contrarian spelled correctly. Well, what I can do for that is I'll just in the video description. I'll throw the link to it. So that they can go great.",

So if anybody is by subscription, you know, there's a annual fee to it. So if anybody's interested, they can direct message me on Twitter and I'll get right back to them. Awesome. Well, like I said, thank you so much. I sincerely enjoyed this ton and I would love, you know, to do another session with you in the future. Sure. Yeah, we'll come back maybe in six months and see how wrong I was. Well, it's like I tell my audience all the time, you know, if you want to make a bunch of money, just do the opposite of what I do. And then you'll be all right. Exactly. Awesome. Thank you. Okay, thanks, Eric.",
