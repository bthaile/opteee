But the fact, I don't even know the full details on this one. Obviously, I saw that, I saw a TikTok video of somebody that was videoing them getting out of the plane. But I mean, that's like a whole upside down plane, like very upside down. I'm not a pilot, but I feel like that's wrong. When I look at that, I get the sensation that this did not go the correct way. I do see they have the wheels out. So the wheels being out is good, but the wheels should be on the ground. And right now they're pointing towards the sky, which we don't necessarily love. Let's see what this says. So all people made it out not immediately clear. Okay. Had one wings severely crumpled to the tail section partially sheared off.

Oh, you mean like as they were coming down, their angle was completely off like that? That would be fucking crazy. Damn. If that's the case, that's crazy work. That would be very not good. Okay, so let's see. As of February 1725, an analysis of aircraft accidents and coming encompassing both civilian and government reveals a nuanced picture of aviation safety compared to previous years. In 2024, there was 11 civilian airplane accidents resulting in 318 fatalities the highest since 2018. Like that statistic is really upsetting because there's zero fucking reason why this should be going backwards. That just doesn't make sense. Like why why in 2024?

But let's go back. I'm going to close the door real quick. And let's take a quick look. Okay, so 24 had 11 civilian airplane accidents. 2023 had 30. 2023 had no fatal accidents despite a 20 increase in air traffic compared to 22. Interesting. Really interesting. So it's hard to say like let me see if are there are there any resources that show the year over year trend? And wonder if there's something that shows us. I don't really care about all these other countries to be honest with you because they'll have different levels of scrutiny on their flights and whatnot and their flight planning. So I actually prefer to use US government stuff for this one. Here we go. What do we got? So they do it by light hours which I like. Okay, let's take a look. Let's go to 22. 21.

Now landing is where we see the most accidents but they're non fatal. Loss of control. Very interesting. So I mean it looks in general like the number of accidents that we see are down trending.

Don't need the. I don't want to actually download this. This is just one of them. So it looks like it's generally going down. So let's take a look at Delta airlines really quick. They're trading down. So that's one thing I was thinking about is that it really wouldn't surprise me much at all to see a bit of a. A bit of a down tick here like pretty much at all.

So this typically becomes an easy really short term trade nothing with like really high conviction or anything like that but something that I at least I typically try to monitor just because it can be an okay short term opportunity. So we'll we'll see how it actually materializes yet. All right so let's take a look at the questions and see. Coffee Donuts says why do you think Ryan Cohen transfers his GME shares from his LC into his own name we looked at that two weeks ago on I actually think I might have done a natural video on it as well talking about it. I'll give you the link to that video but I can also save you the time which is I don't know and I don't think anybody is given a actual answer as to why.

And I also think Nvidia is such a great example of a news cycle. It's such a great example because there was nothing really material that changed about Nvidia other than deep seek news coming out. And the funniest thing about that is the news by deep seek didn't really usurp in video the trail of thought was deep seek saying this is way cheaper so then Nvidia's ability to monetize it is going to go down that's why they started punishing the stock but it still doesn't position Nvidia away from the epicenter of the adoption of AI. So this was one of the easiest no-brainer ideas that existed I think.

    "text": "one of the easiest no-brainer ideas that existed I think. So I think from a near term perspective now it's probably going to find its way back into congestion right so this point of control everything's been transacting here for a while I think that the average holding iteration in Nvidia is probably quite quite a while. So because of that I don't think that it's necessarily going to get punished right back down to a prior levels but the way I look at it is now it's coming into earnings release. So the way I would play Nvidia going forwards at this point is from an investor perspective probably favorite to the upside continually but from a trading perspective it's already made most of the recovery it still has maybe another 10 to 12 points to go before it starts closing in on all time highs again and that's really going to be driven by its earnings release. If it reports as well as most people typically expect Nvidia to report then it wouldn't surprise me at all to see it have another smash quarter just absolutely crushing things but if it reports light my guess is it probably will get punished for it because Nvidia at this point down here it had like a anywhere depending on what time frame you looked at it it had anywhere of a less than one peg to less than two peg which is crazy for something like this. So lift notes",

So lift notes of all of that I think it looks extremely solid I think that Nvidia will continue to be one of the absolute most dominant elements of AI adoption they've positioned themselves to be so so at this point it really becomes all eyes on earnings if it has a really great earnings I think it flies if it doesn't have a great earnings it would not surprise me to see it consolidate for a while I don't think it's going to pukets guts out and rotate down in any significant way I don't see why it would unless its earnings come in like crazy off but I don't see really the world or the scenario why that would be the case. So if we take a look at one is it the 26th this says after the close so let's take a look at Nvidia and let's take a look at the volatility cycle on 28th Feb we'll take a look at the surface.

    "text": "the same thing I was talking to you about Nvidia it becomes a game of pot odds right so if we go back to 2024 do we think that smc i is better positioned now than it was in 2024 I think most of us would argue yes and if we look through this it also looks like yes from even a quantitative perspective so the fact that it's trading so close to its range from 2024 which was around 30 is great opportunity for some upside but the question is is how much upside because this movement is not normal so for smc i from an investing perspective I think it could be okay it really depends on one second I got a yellow Thor it really depends on the duration and what you think the company might do in the future but from a trading perspective it does look like there's a short-term bullish opportunity I just don't like how much it's lagging so it can absolutely provide a decent bullish opportunity and a big reason for that is because you start to think well how far are we from the floor right and you can see that it ticked a low of 17 and a half so this chart is really misleading because of how huge all these different moves have been if I change it to a log scale it'll give you a little bit more context the reason why the log scale is so important",

Honestly, the only thing that matters to us is if Pelosi's in it. Damn. Bullshit. Pelosi's not in it. Well, that's just the worst, isn't it? Damn. Damn. I don't know. I wonder if we can not click anything. That's also fun. Damn, it's completely locked up again. I wanted to know if we can add like a government tracking tool for us to pay attention to together. But this thing is completely locked up again. I need to finish this update cycle because it's fucking killing me. There it goes. Damn boy. Let's get through its financials then. So this is what I was looking for. So cardiology, absolute biggest business unit, man, 2.3 billion. Fuck. These fucking medical companies are just massive. See, like this, I actually don't love some of this slightly slower growth. But I mean, overall, it's looking really, really good. Yeah, see, like take a look at this medical med surge. I'm assuming that's medical surgery is like 7 growth. But if you take a look at cardiovascular, it's fucking 27 and 22. So cardiovascular is the place to be for them. Yeah, so they're, they're looking really, really good. And then",

Cement trades? Insiders FDA. I want to see if we can add that. God damn it. It's locked up again. We're never going to get through there. So I'm going to leave that alone for now. And let me see if there's anything else that you guys want to take a look at. Cali Luca says I saw someone doing the same with a gold fish on Wall Street bets versus Wall Street bets. That's so funny. How did they do it? Cali Luca, how did they do it? Because that's the main thing I'm trying to figure out. In my brain, I'm a little too like scientific and not like good scientific, just hack scientific. But I try to do things in an actual at least reasonably scientific pure method. So like I'm struggling to find a way to get Thor to pick the names without him being skewed in some way. Like he can be skewed by proximity, whichever treat as close as he might go for, which might not actually represent the thing that we're looking for. Like",

Because we got to get that we got to get that dialed in because I think that would be so fun for a Thor like to watch him do that. I just imagine I can get such a kick out of it. There is a chicken trading and account. See like a chicken makes sense too because I feel like a chicken is more random. I love this idea. I think it's going to be super fun. I just need to figure out how to get the treats or like we don't give them treats. We just give them his kibble. But I need to figure out how to get the food to him so that it's in an unbiased way. And it's like the true randomness of what he chooses to eat. And before we wrap up, I actually had one thing I wanted to run by you, which is this, where is it? This.

So this segment is really designed to be whatever we want it to be. And I try to keep it really focused on ways to help build your trading skillset. So I'm not going to wait for this to unfreeze because it pissed me off. And I'm going to restart the computer. But if there's anything that you would like me to add to the trading skills development, please throw it in the chat or hit me up in the discord with it so that I can add it to our list. Right now the list is pretty good, but I continually want to keep growing it. So that wraps me up for today. As always, if you need anything, let me know being outlier. Feel it.",
