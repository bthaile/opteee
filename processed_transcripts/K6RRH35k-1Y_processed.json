So, one of the things I think makes a lot of sense for a new trader is first be greater than zero, focus on the process. Then once you are able to be greater than zero, we want to start scaling ultimately to where we want to land. So, let's say our ultimate target is 20 per year, whatever. Well, going from zero to 20 is a big jump. So, a really great interim step is to see if you can paste the market. And a big thing that I would be looking for in pacing the market is can I do it with lower risk? And this is a measure by volatility. So, what I mean by this is if the stock market returns 8.5 on that year. However, you return 8.2. I wouldn't inherently consider this a miss. I would then say what was the max drawdown of this version versus this version, which gives me a simple risk-adjusted performance metric. You could use sharp sortino, whatever makes you happy. This is just essentially a very base version. But it gives a super important context. Because if we do this, let's say this had a 12 max drawdown and let's say that we had a 9 max drawdown, well, this is actually quite a bit",

Because if we do this, let's say this had a 12 max drawdown and let's say that we had a 9 max drawdown, well, this is actually quite a bit better. I'll take this one over this one for sure. So, that's the broader idea here. So, now, we know what our target is going to be to start, which will be this metric here. So, this is our first thing we need to answer. The second thing we need to answer is risk tolerance. The risk tolerance for a 5,000 account is pretty simple, I think. There's no worlds where you will be able to pursue a really strong return without having a pretty large risk profile in front of you. The reason for this is because when we look at the market and we look at building a portfolio, there's going to be a ton of limitations that you have that you simply have to accept. So, trying to define risk tolerance as the 30 max drawdown is unrealistic. It's probably not going to happen. So, in the case of a really small portfolio, the way that I mentally would bucket it as if like this is the total risk, I wouldn't trade that way. But I would prepare my mind to lose this entire amount. The reason why I'm saying that is because if you think of",

But I would prepare my mind to lose this entire amount. The reason why I'm saying that is because if you think of that and you're like, oh, shit, I don't want to lose the 5K, then that tells me we might need to take some of this out, put it into something else, and then trade with the residual. With a small account, you kind of have to be prepared to lose that account. It doesn't have to happen. In my opinion, I don't think you need to go that route, but it happens in most instances. So, to deny that or to not at least acknowledge that as a potential route to me is just a complete mistake. So, our risk tolerance instead, we know 30 probably isn't going to cut it. So, maybe we target something like 50. So, this will be a 50 max drawdown. So, that means our 5K account would be looking like 2,500. That essentially serves as the portfolio level circuit breaker.

The other reason I'm not going further back in time is because on demand has limitations in terms of like the ability to populate data. So, I don't want to go back too far because then everything in there starts to get really wonky. So, we'll start with 22. In the context of 22, we know we have hindsight bias going into this because we know 22 is an up year. Nonetheless, the ability for us to like tinker with this approach, I still think we'll hold absolutely fine. So, let's do that. So, we'll focus on 22.

January 1st, the beginning of the year. This is good. So, this is after the market had sold off a bit coming from 22 bear market. So, now we're able to start looking at some ideas. Now, the first thing that we need to figure out is like what kind of stuff is even accessible to us with respect to trying to trade a coverage triangle or a ratio diagonal. Now, the way that I would do this is I would conduct a scan. Now, I don't know if scanning works. It doesn't. So, scanning does not work in on demand, unfortunately. So, maybe we could just poke through the watch list and see if anything because this looks like it's updating effectively. And maybe we can find some stuff here. I'm trying to see if Ibit was actually like tradable then. Because I think Ibit just got launched. Yeah, so that's no good. I think some sort of Bitcoin proxy would be nice though. What was QLD? 34. Okay, so these will be okay. So, QLD will be okay. TQs. Literally, this will probably where we'll go. So, TQs will serve as the base for a coverage triangle. This is based more on price. And this is in like if you see TQs",

This is based more on price. And this is in like if you see TQs below 20 bucks, I'm interested effectively no matter what because the risk there is pretty contained. So, this would allow us to trade effectively an entire coverage triangle on it with the caveat that if we want to get into shares, we can't let it run too far. So, I would start with shares to begin the position. So, let's start building what this portfolio might actually look like. And I'm going to grab this.

So, let's start with the stuff that matters. So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to break, I'm going to actually break this down so that it's easier for us to see like what we're doing. But our first position will start with the core allocation. The core allocation in the context of this portfolio should get most of the money.

So, now we know loosely, again, to start what allocation of the portfolio is going to get what? Most of this will obviously go into a coverage strangle here. Probably a little bit more because in order for us to do a too lot, we would need to use 1672 upfront for the first purchase, which is what we'll do. And then to be able to sell a put, we'll need a little bit more. So, in the context here, it'll be 3, Jan. I'm not going to worry about putting in the year because it doesn't matter that much. Stock prices at 1672, this will be starting just 100 shares. And there's no expiration on that. The basis is going to be 1672. So, we can calculate the cost for this.

What I'm going to do is position myself so that I at least am looking at this in the more likely context of what it likely would look like. That's the way that I'm thinking about it. So, for",

If there is an expiration, it's an option. The cost calculation is D 77 times H 77 times 100. Pretty much it. And out of curiosity, I'm going to take this same prompt. I'm going to drop it into chat GPT because I also have that up. I just want to compare what they give us. You guys know, I typically like to do this. Ah, see? This is why I like to do it because there are two different things. This is what chat GPT gave me. And then this is what Gemini gave us. So, let's see. So, it's checking for blank. This is using different functionality. And this is saying Excel. So, this might be defaulting to Excel when it shouldn't. But if is blank is still a function in here, which is fine. I actually like what this came up with better. So, let's jump this in. It should be negative 1672. It is. If we drag this down, it should be 120. It is. So, the formula works great. Done. Done and done. Reese says, damn, the advantage of AI is when you know exactly what you need. I meander too much. So, let's say you didn't know what you need in this scenario.

Here's what I would say. And I'm just going to put it in S. So, in S76, I want to indicate if an option is a put or a call. In F76, I input the strike followed by C or P. C for call or P or put.

And then we also need to calculate how much risk is out because as we know, this is going to be a limiting factor, meaning the number of positions we can actually put on. So, right now, margin and risk are the same again for the reasons I was explaining before. These are going to be the same because these are defined as the cash requirement. So, now we need to get and figure out if we want to put our call on or if not. I actually see that we're a little under invested where as of right now, especially with a smaller account, I wouldn't want to leave a ton of cash sitting to the side. I would like to keep a little bit of money sitting to the side if possible. So, what that means to me is I don't necessarily want this to be 3,500 what I see here. But I also know that I would prefer not to cap the upside of these options when I sell a call. So, we're going to see if maybe instead of doing 100, let's see if we do 125.

And the way that I would be thinking about this 5,000 portfolio is that if I'm doing what I should be doing and aggressively saving every month, this should continue to go up. So, that then I can filter more capital to be able to build into these positions over time. This is just again, this is the game of trade-offs and this is a pretty big one because you're between a rock and a hard place. You don't want to use all your money up front and certainly not. But we also do not want to have capped upside. So, maybe we'll see if we can just do like 110. That takes us to 1839. That gives us like 150 bucks, which isn't much, but it's something.

So, the reason why I say that is like, as you're doing these different formulas and stuff, I wouldn't get to the point where like, you ask it to do everything. I would still actively be trying to think through it myself because there's a lot of value in that process. Okay. So, we know so far that our total debits, like the money that exists out, that we've bought outright is 2090 credit. We have 179 dollars in. So, what we can do is we can figure out what our credits are relative to the total portfolio size in terms of a return. And we're already at 3.58 percent return, which is massive. That's a big return. So, again, if we were to annualize 3.58 percent over the course of a month, 3.58 percent, that's a 52.5 percent return.

So, we don't really need to add more risk here, although we can and we should. So, now let's actually see if Gemini can help us here. What I want to do is ask it for a list of stocks that are like sub-hundred dollars. Great. Because that's the hardest thing to do in this scenario is like the active scanning process that I would do because it's scanning back in time. So, actually, we can just, I think the watch list will be better for this. Let's use the watch list. So, we have our first position on. Great. And we're looking for more. So, we should, as always, go to Ford. Because Ford is like the Toyota Corolla of the stock market, meaning everybody who's poor trades Ford at some point. And it's just because that's how it goes. So, Ford has had kind of like this triple bottom. I don't love this broader trend that you're seeing from 22 into 23. So, this is the kind of thing we're like at least in the beginning. If I were to trade it to the upside, it would be very, very cautiously. But this is just not what I would pick yet. So, we'll add this to a watch list. So, let's add, I don't think",

So, right now, I'm just flipping through the watch list looking for stuff that's weak. Lauren says Ford is boring. Ford is very boring. But what's fun is making money and then using that money to do stuff you enjoy. So, I will fully grant to you that Ford is boring. It most certainly is. But I also personally wouldn't care if Ford is boring as I try to remind traders like in the beginning, the job, the entire goal of what we're doing is to make money. So, yeah, I don't disagree though. Ford, it's massively boring. Jayden says,",

So, we can take a look at that as well. I wouldn't short this yet because of this little bit of a recovery rally. So, we can add this to our watch list. Let's check CCL. This looks interesting. So, CCL does look a little bit weak here. But I feel like this post earnings rally. It's a little too early because it kind of held this support level. So, I would wait here as well probably. Let's check SoFi. SoFi is kind of interesting and SoFi is also super cheap. SoFi is one of those names where if we wanted to trade it, this is kind of cool because it doesn't take a ton of money. But I would trade this to the long side personally. So, I mean, we don't have to do a short. We could do along. The reason why I like this is because I would consider this a pretty low risk entry.

Maybe a month and a half if it's long. So, that tells me a lot about what expiration I would want to go into if I'm maybe planning on holding for like 45 days.

And I'm purposely picking stuff that like I don't really know about because some of these, I know exactly how they did, which I don't want to, I don't want to trade them. See, this looks interesting. Apple looks interesting because this seems like, this seems like it's like falling pretty heavy. Like that's a, a not insignificant down day. So, let's see what the call side looks like here. And this is just to see these are 5 wide. So, this is immediately out of the equation. Next. Amazon away. Meta to expensive Netflix to expensive. Good maybe. Microsoft to expensive. Cisco. So, Cisco looks decent here, I would say. It's, and it's funny because Cisco is actually rallying right now when most other stuff is kind of doing poorly. So, let's see what we can get for like a put credit spread. At the 45 handle. You'd have to go two and a half dollars wide. And you get 50, 52 cents. It's a little big. If I could get something closer to like a dollar wide, I would like it a little bit more. But this is two and a half dollars wide collecting 52 cents. So, yeah, I, I don't hate it, but it's a little big, but I think we might be able to",

So, like we're talking about doing a one lot, the width here is two and a half dollars wide. The premium we're talking about is 50 cents. So, what we can do is we can make it so that we just give it these handful of inputs and we can calculate not just the win, loss, but we can also calculate the expected return, which again, on spreads is typically going to be negative. But we want to see how much of a negative it is and how good, because we're trading directionally right now. By selling a put spread here, this is not like a, I don't have an opinion or I think, you know, I don't think direct, like you think it directionally, you don't get to not think directly with the vertical spread. So, anyways, the total win size here is just our premium. Times size times 100. I don't know why I added a parenthesis, just because felt good.

Now, the other stuff we can throw into here again quickly is we could do probability of a win, probability of a loss, probability of a win in this case, we can either use delta or we can use the actual calculated probability. So, the probability is 34 chance of being in the money. So, the way I would do this is like this. Probability of losing is 34, 17. This isn't necessarily a max loss, but this is the probability of losing. And then this is just one less this. So, now I have a quick look at what the probabilities are. And then again, as you know, now we can calculate the expected return. Just so that we know, we already know it's going to be negative. Well, we don't know, but pretty good suspicion that it will be negative. So, this will be the win size times our probability of a win plus loss size times probability of a loss. So, this is negatively expected 35, which again, fully that doesn't surprise me. Vertical spreads are very often going to be this.

And it makes me like this trade more. So PFE 50.95 size one X3 17 Feb. Now we're looking at the 52.5 55s. So 52.5 slash 55. These are the calls. Delta is 0.38 by 0.2. Premium is again, we're calling it 68 cents. We know our risk in the trade is 182. So now we're 80 utilized. That's beautiful. That's like a pretty good spot to be. And we're looking again, if we were to plot out our return, our return target for the year. We'll just do 9. We'll just pick the midpoint. So you can see like we're already well on the way in terms of what this might get us. And again, this is not including a return potential on the long shares. This is just using a return potential based on the credit that we've taken in so far. So this is almost like what we're trying to get over the full year. Now we don't expect this to happen. We fully anticipate the probability of stuff going wrong to be pretty high, such as the nature of trading. So now let's just fast forward time. Let's see what's up. So now I'll bring us forward. I don't want to go full weeks because I wouldn't wait that long to do stuff. So",

I don't want to go full weeks because I wouldn't wait that long to do stuff. So we'll skip days. We'll do like every other day to start. Zah. Buyers of trade already looks good. And this is starting to break down more. So this almost starts to become interesting from a couple of other ideas. One thing that I would be consulting with that I just can't right now based on where the platform is is just implied volatility percentile and rank like I can't see any of that. So I'm just using the options chain to proxy it. But I would want to use that for sure. But these are still mostly directional plays. Okay. So Pfizer, where do we sit right now? We had the 52 and a half's and the 55's. We sold those for 68 cents. And it's already at like 34. So those might need to come down soon actually. But not that soon. We still have 20 delta's on the short so we can wait a little bit on Pfizer. So nothing, nothing doing there. Let's go to Cisco. I'm just going to go backwards. So Cisco is going against us. We have the 45 42 half put spread. We put that on for 50 cents. Our we're down here",

We're at the 21. But I really wouldn't want to get ran over. So gonna have to pay pretty close attention to those calls, I think. And then the put we just need to see if we need to rebalance it. One of the things to keep in mind is with something that's at these price levels is you're going to run out of the ability to short puts super fast. Right. So think about it. The original put that we that we sold was at the 15. So as TQs might make its rally. And I don't remember exactly the path had for the beginning of the year. But as this has its rally, what's going to happen is even if we try to rebalance the the delta's on these, let's take a look. So we're at the 15",

But as this has its rally, what's going to happen is even if we try to rebalance the the delta's on these, let's take a look. So we're at the 15 put right. We're already down to 17 delta's that started at a 13 delta. We lost half our delta's right away. I would want to rebalance this. The problem is if we bring it back up to the 17s, what just happened. We now just add another 200 to this trade that will put us at our total allocation available for the trade literally right away, which is extremely suboptimal. And again, it's why saving and all this other stuff is important. So a trader is faced with this kind of thing with a very difficult situation in my opinion, because you either have to just buy the shares outright and just hold it until it comes back down. Or you sell the put by the shares a little bit later when they're a little bit more expensive. Now, just understanding the fact that this is kind of a ticking timeframe. And you are running out of the choices available to you pretty quickly. I would probably favor just buying shares. I would prefer to be able to sell the puts, but they're going to end up taking way too much of the account unless I decide to give myself",

I would prefer to be able to sell the puts, but they're going to end up taking way too much of the account unless I decide to give myself a little bit more on the core allocation, which might have to happen. I might flex a little bit here because we can see from the speculative allocation, we're not using anywhere near this amount of money. The total sum that we have on right now is 382 of risk relative to the 1500 that we're expecting to use here. So we have room to play. So my gameplay in here will probably be to roll these up to the 18 or to the 17, to the 17, I think here, because that's going to give me double the deltas that I have, well, not double the deltas, double the premium that I have, and almost double the delta, which I need. Otherwise, I'm going to miss the directional move, which I don't want. So let's go to 9, Jan. Let's take a look at the price. It's 1892. And these would be closed at 57.

So that gave us a 4.2 return on a Vesic capital. So there's our first put that's out the door.

We can look for more that kind of thing. I'm going to fast forward time. Just so that we can, because I know that we're pretty deep in this. We're ready in our 15 minutes. So let's just, I fast forward it a little bit more time. Ah, bummer. So at this point, our short puts will be doing really well. But we kind of missed our opportunity to buy shares, at least to get another smooth 100 lot. We're too late now, which sucks, but is what it is. So let's take a look at what these are trading at. Now the 17 puts, they're down for 30 cents down at 11 Delta. If we rolled them up to the 20 that takes us another 300 bucks. So that would take us to a total of 4,090. That's 90. Right. So we're, we're out of the put game here. Unfortunately. So here's what would happen next in my approach to this kind of thing. This would come down. Stock is now at 2166. These are going to come down for, what did we say 30? That's called 30 cents. And really the only thing we can do at this point is buy shares with the residual allocation that we have as much",

This would have been managed earlier for sure, especially when you have like a smaller amount tied to this. So just as what it is. So 21 66 is when we're managing these.

You can see literally together while we were on this, we built a rudimentary log with the key stuff that matters. This isn't everything, but it's the main stuff that's applicable to what we're doing. We have a useful side calculator that we'll use for one of the core strategies that we have. We have our watch list that we're following these different names to see which way we might want to trade them. And we have some portfolio level statistics. We have what we're trying to make on the year based on our input return target, which in this case is the midpoint between 8 and 10. And we're able, another thing that I would do is I would differentiate so that this could be more automated. Just differentiate and be like, have a flag if it's core speculative, see your S, so that you can see your running totals of core and speculative, make it a little easier to come up with those numbers.

So for example, what I would do is I would just have the core allocation calculate if the ticker is TQs because that's what we're using for core in this scenario. And then if it's not TQs, then it's speculative. That's how I would think about it. So notice how we're not using the entire portfolio. You don't have to. Notice how we have a couple complementing positions. We have stuff that's short premium to the upside, short premium to the downside. We have our core position already built. And the game now is literally just cycling through and making the same decision tree that you've seen so far. Like that's literally it. That's all that goes into this. But there's a couple things that matter a lot to us to track. So for example, the risk, I would split the risk tracking out into two places, core risk, speculative risk.

    "text": "track. So for example, the risk, I would split the risk tracking out into two places, core risk, speculative risk. Because the core risk is going to be a dominant portion of this. The speculative risk will be a smaller subset. But I want to see how much of a subset that it actually is. That's useful information for me to track. Stuff like that. But the broader idea here is when you're trading a small account, it's annoying. There are disadvantages. But it's very doable. Notice how we use things like verticals, which I don't care for. But it is what it is. Because when we're trading vertical spreads in a small account, you're accepting the fact that it's not the most efficient expression of what you're trying to do. However, there's a tradeoff. And it makes it fit the account better because remember, even when we're sizing stuff like this, 200 bucks, that doesn't seem like that much. This represents 4 risk on the entire portfolio. That's not a trivial amount of money that's being put at risk at the portfolio level for a vertical spread where you're aiming to make 50 bucks. So this is also why I think it makes a lot of sense to have buy side strategies. And that's actually what I would have done after the first time advance or maybe the second time advance. We could do it really quick now just because we're here so that we can at least close",

Sitting here, chatting about options. It would be a little bit better if it wasn't about a small account. That's kind of annoying. But chatting about options with the outlier community, it's the best thing you could do on a Friday. Love your channel. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. I hope that this stuff is useful. All right. Let's take a look at these on our watch list really quick. Ford, we didn't have an opinion on and it looks downside. But it held this. That's interesting. So we looked at it here. It rallied hard, consolidated and is rallying again. So I would probably go upside in Ford if I had to pick. And then so far, we wanted long calls in here. Again, I think the spot we decided would be a breakout though, which would have been here. This is where that entry would have been. So so far would be long. Some sort of call position there.

I remember now because because of this initial drop at holding this consolidation, it wasn't a fade or a long. I wouldn't have traded either way here. So I probably wouldn't have traded this to the upside. This maybe at this point could be something for like a call credit spread, but I wouldn't be convinced because this year it's consolidating super super super effectively.

That's over a week and I would want to come out a day earlier if possible. We'll do like the 15 July. So let's see what we can get for just a standard box spread. We'll keep this at 75 for now. It might be okay. 55. Yeah, this is fine. So let's buy cell 65 by so in a lot. So right now the mid is 99615 probably wouldn't get a fill there, but let's see. So on a one lot using 5,500, 6,500, tracking the net premium out to start as 996.15. That yeah, there's no way you'd get a fill there. That puts us at a 5.72 premium over the risk-free rate. The total loan out there is just 99615 so assuming 100,000 overall idea. The corresponding I need to update the current risk-free rates though. And again, those that are in the the pros side of stuff you guys have this already. This is just a template that you can download. Okay, so now we have a slightly different picture. It's 5.81.

It looks like a modest shift in the front. That's kind of curious to me. Anyways, so let's, yeah, so anyways, like when I look at trading a box spread, this is more or less why I prefer to trade box spreads out right because you essentially are going to get a better you're going to get a better rate just by trading it yourself, which I think is at least what would I tend to prefer. Yeah. Interesting. The curve shifted like not a ton but a little bit. So like the front was 4335. Now it's at 4224 for a month. It's not an insignificant front shift. Not enough. So anyways, yeah, that's why I prefer box spreads personally. Chase says is part one available. Yeah, so part one, you actually have to skip through a lot of it. Where's part one here?

Part one, you have to skip through a lot of it because um, we had like a conversation in the beginning about what we were going to focus on based on a couple polls that we took. So I would start it at what I'll tell you right now. Let's see. So here we are. So we want to start I think here. I don't know. There's actually. Wait a minute. This is this one. What the fuck? I was like, what's happening? It's so funny. Look, this is straight doppelganger. All right, this is the right one. All right, all right. So we want to start from like here. I would say like 28 minutes in. That's where I would kick off. I updated the timestamp in there so that you'll be able to see exactly where to start. All right. Black mama says 5k is really hard. I've made challenges from one to two A plus setups. I actually don't like that's the thing is 5k really isn't hard. The hard part with a 5,000 account is a trader wrapping their arms around what's realistic. That's the hard part because you can see even in the example that we just went through together. If we take a look at the like the realized returns here and this here 71.71 gross dollars is probably the most disinteresting and unappealing return on planet earth, right? Like",

If we take a look at the like the realized returns here and this here 71.71 gross dollars is probably the most disinteresting and unappealing return on planet earth, right? Like nobody cares about that. However, in the context of like an actual market return, that's not bad. Right? 1.42 return over the course of a few weeks is not bad. So I think that's probably one of the biggest struggles people will go through. The implementation of a 5,000 account really isn't that difficult. It's just a matter of accepting those trade-offs. The hard part is for somebody to be able to look at something that is going to make them a bunch of money really fast and easy that doing that and saying something like a 1.42 return getting you 71 is good. I think that's the real hard part for for people which totally understand. Like that's difficult to swallow. John says, I really want your look at AR and that gas. We'll probably do that on maybe the Monday stream. But yeah, I think box itself is fine, but I would just trade box spreads out right myself. You'll get a better yield. That's just that's the function. Black Mamba says it's hard for an experience for a pro. It's okay. Each mistake can end in a blow up. These are facts. Yeah, but that again, like",

Each mistake can end in a blow up. These are facts. Yeah, but that again, like that's the point is that if you manage your expectations, none of these if we even experienced a full loss would blow the account. Right? That's actually the entire point is that this pads you. So even if we lost our entire TQ's position, which is the largest position this would have, we still would have just under two grand to use. So again, that that goes back because each trade you put on needs to be thought through so that it is not that because for a lot of people, they're just so focused on how much money they think they're going to be able to make from a position that they don't spend enough time looking at even this like we talked about, right? These vertical spreads. The vertical spreads are shots. They're directional trades. It's you could be right. It could be wrong. It's like if it's shot, however, if we size these smartly, even if we lose on them, it still gives the portfolio a large enough chance to be able to put more on for the numbers to kind of break out a little bit better.

So the thing here is most people that start with a small account, just start with the completely wrong expectations, which is really what the first session was about, right? The first session, I don't remember where it is. Those somewhere around here. No. Here. So if you take a look at what actually matters, if a new trader is able to wrap their arms around like what actually matters, then run in a 5K account really isn't that difficult. But the problem is most don't. And most people who start trading options just kind of flop around haphazardly. Black Mama says inexperience will deteriorate and lose the account. A pro will handle most of 5K or used by unexperience. It is what it is. Yeah. No, I completely agree. I think most, but that's again, that's the whole point of the segment, right? Is because for a lot of people, the reason why they approach it that way is just because they don't know better. And I remember when I first started trading options, I didn't know any better.

And people who are inexperienced tend to think that trading is going to be fast easy money. And again, as soon as you're around for a little bit, you know, objectively, this is not the case. And the, I think the main issue that people with small accounts tend to have is really, really fucked expectations that then ends up being their undoing unnecessarily. Simply if somebody just knows a little bit better about the reality of what this thing is likely to look like. So yeah, I agree though. It definitely is, it's challenging because there's a big pill that has to be swallowed that nobody likes. That's the issue. But cool. All right, gang. Hope this session is useful. I hope this is like the mini series at least gives you some ideas on different ways to approach trading 5K account again. Today we literally just built a portfolio together back in time from scratch.

And if you can do that, then you can position yourself to be in a much better spot. And again, you'll notice that a big thing that I always talk about is paper trading because even if you're actively live trading a 5K account, the way to think about it is you're just learning the basics that's not going to be done to scale the account massively. You're just getting a proof of concept. So you should still be doing that with the paper trading account in parallel so that you can test different things, test trading more so at scale, that kind of stuff.
