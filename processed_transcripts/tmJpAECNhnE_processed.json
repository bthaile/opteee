    "text": "Admiral, we have any ships to go to the south. It's a trap. You heard it from the man here first. That's our trap. That's kind of the nature of our brains with respect to trading. There are a lot of traps that are very easy to find your way into. And we all will experience these to different degrees. Now, one of the main things is to do your best and learn from these potential circumstances before you go through them yourself so that you have a little bit of an idea before you get too far into the weeds. So cognitive biases, believe it or not, we as human decision makers are literally riddled with cognitive biases. These are just some of them from my website. You can pop on, go look through it, your leisure. But there are some of these that are really, really dangerous. So things like the disposition effect is one that you have to be aware of. This is where we have a tendency to cut winning trades too short and let losers run, which is coupled with something called loss a version. Confirmation bias is another really, really important one. This is where we focus more so on information that confirms what we want to see and not what the objective reality might be. Hindsight bias, really important. Hindsight bias is when things seem ever so clear when we're looking at stuff in the rear view mirror, meaning stuff that has happened",

Hindsight bias is when things seem ever so clear when we're looking at stuff in the rear view mirror, meaning stuff that has happened before. And I have a video that goes through all of these way more in detail. We're not going through one by one. You have to be aware of these. That's what it boils down to. You have to be aware of the presence of each and every one of these because they have ways to slowly siphon money away from you or to lead you into making really poor decisions in a really short term timeframe. So the main fix here is to conduct a landscape analysis. What I mean by this is to take a look at how traders tend to behave and tend to perform. And you'll actually see in a little bit, I have a bunch of examples from places like Reddit. Reddit is not my favorite place to learn about trading, but it definitely is my absolute favorite place to learn about the experience of traders because you're going to come across a wide gamut of it. And a lot of them will be unfortunately unsuccessful. But there's a learning point for you in every single one of those instances. You also can implement things like external audits.

And if you're part of our discord community, it's completely free to join. You can always ask another trader in there. That's why I'm built the community for you as a resource for traders among one another to connect with other quality people that are genuinely interested in some of the same stuff. And finally, the way you can identify a lot of these things is if you track what you're doing because we have a really faulty memory when we're trying to remember what we did while we did it. So if you're taking notes as you're doing things, all of your different cognitive biases, they're all going to bubble up. You're going to see them clear as day. And then you can create controls to make sure that you're analyzing things objectively, that you're examining things holistically from an objective bias as compared to just trying to confirm what you want to see.

This is the propensity for traders and people in general to either not sufficiently and objectively analyze themselves or in endeavor what they're doing in individual trade, all of those things. This is why a lot of times let's use a basic example. If somebody says, hey, how long is it going to take you to get ready? People will say, oh, it's eight, we've been five minutes. And then 15 minutes later, they're still not there. You're like, what the hell's going on? That's Goldilocks analysis. They think they're going to move a lot faster than they actually do. This translates to trading in a lot of really nefarious ways. But this is where we spend way more time looking at what we think we want to see happen in a trade as compared to what might actually happen in a trade. So let's take a look at an example of that right here. So we can see that this is from a while ago on Theta Gang. And we have this person that got a sign on arc down 50 what now. So they sent a bunch of cash secure puts and they got assigned on some shares. They were waiting for a time to wheel it and they're down 15 from their entry.

I was telling you about there's a lot of issues that you can pick apart from this thing. But the really interesting thing about this is you can tell when they first entered this trade, the only thing they're considering is what they were making from those cash secured puts. They clearly did not consider this side of the trade. And for their question of how do I avoid this in the future, you analyze both sides of the trade. You don't just analyze the side of the trade that you're interested in that you want to see happen. That's a primary driver of what you see here. The next thing, the attachment from your trading capital. These instances are really interesting. And there's a couple ways we can overcome this. And this is a nefarious, nefarious thing. So detachment from trading capital allows us to cope with losses. And you can see that that's a problem for a lot of people. Here's the deal.

That's how he's able to watch it. Eb in flow, 160,000 in a day is compared to up 130,000 a day before. And then eventually this grows into million. Most of us, if we were up 1.5 million, we would take that down in an instant and move on forever. Meanwhile, the next day, because he didn't unwind there, he was up 7 million. That's the point. So the way that we overcome our ability to let trades and systems work is by giving them time, space, and room to move and mentally decoupling ourselves from the money that goes into it. The other thing is through exposure therapy. The way that works is let's say that you think 100 is a lot of money still. And you put on a trade, you lose 100, and it's really, really painful. The way that you slowly get over that is maybe you put on a trade that's a little bit smaller that maybe loses up to 80 bucks. And then you slowly ratchet that up as you get more and more comfortable with the size of the trades that you see, that builds up over time. Okay, next one, false attribution.

I've been profitable almost every day, but it's always greed that gets me. I have a target of 500 day been up 2000 only to lose it on a trade and be down like 400 bucks. So they're attributing this to greed, but is this actually greed? It certainly seems like there's an element to it. But the problem is is that if this person thinks it's greed and only greed, they're probably not capturing some of the really important details that I can pick up from this from actual positive attribution of what's going on here. One of them is I can tell you that they don't have a written plan because if they did this short circuit, essentially all of this. If you",

One of them is I can tell you that they don't have a written plan because if they did this short circuit, essentially all of this. If you have a plan that you really trust and you just wanted to play that plan, then this sensation goes away. The other thing I can tell is that there's no risk management plan to the downside because if we're worried about making 500 a day up 2,000 to allow that 2,000 to turn into down 400, tells us we have an issue managing risk to the downside. That's also loss of version which we learned from the first cognitive bias overview section. So the point is we need to we need to dig deeper. We can't just stop at a superficial answer and say, okay, greed is one hell of a drug. I'm sure that that's a part of what we see here. But then we have to ask why is greed one hell of a drug here? Because I want to make more money. Why? And so on and so forth, you'll start to illuminate way, way, way more details about your process as compared to what seems to be a smart superficial answer. The reason why I say smart is because you're taught not to be greedy or taught to take profits fast in all of these kinds",

The reason why I say smart is because you're taught not to be greedy or taught to take profits fast in all of these kinds of things, but it might not actually be the plaguing issue underneath and it can lead you down the wrong path. Last thing, undisciplined approach. This is super easy. You need to have trader documentation and I have videos about all of this. But this simply comes down to doing the work before you ever place a trade and in fact, that's where all the work is done. If you go through the process of outlining what you're trying to do before you do it, you're quantifying things. You can avoid this really, really dangerous, dangerous path. So we have an example here where somebody saying, is should I sell the option or exercise? Guess what? This person should define this before they get into the trade. Just as this person should have defined what their exit point would be in the unhappy path, meaning avoiding Goldilocks analysis, and the unhappy path of the trade going against us, we should define where we would get out. The problem here is not having a clear plan in place. If you go through that ahead of time, you short circuit literally all of this. So these are five of the most impactful",
