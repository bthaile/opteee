    "text": "Welcome to Outlier Options Trading Tips where I teach you something in three minutes or less, let's get right to it. One of the most common mistakes new options traders make is when they're analyzing something just like Visa for an example because it's up and we want to take a position on it. We think it might continue to go up. We're not exactly sure what timeframe it might continue to go up, but as we take a look over at the options chain, we can see that there are a lot of different explorations available to us and we say, well, I think it might happen in 25 days. So a lot of novice traders do is they pick this 25 day expiration because in their idea, the trade might play out sometime over the next 25 days. What's the problem with this? Well, I'll show you exactly the issue. If we take a look at two different scenarios with the same exact trade, you're right above my head, you can see you can't see a lot of the trade details don't worry about it, or essentially buying it at the money call in Visa using two different explorations. There's 16 Jan 26. So that's a little over 300 days away. And then there's 21 March 25, which is pretty close. It's 20 something days away. And we might say, well, my idea corresponds with this 21 March 25 expiration. So I'm going to buy these ones also.",

Whereas the 16 Jan 26 is their 3790 much more expensive. So let's click into this. And I want you to pay attention to a specific column this one right here, the delta and then the theta. So for those that don't know, delta is the rate of change of your premium per one point movement underline. So you have about a 51 delta on these options. You take a look at your theta. You're losing 21 in 45 cents per day. You have to pay attention to this number because the longer your idea doesn't come to pass, the more your options decay. So what that does is it requires a larger and larger move in order for you to subsequently make money. Now if we take a look at this longer data option, and we take a look at the delta, this one is a 61 delta. So slightly higher delta, but if you take a look at your theta, even though it's much more expensive, you're only losing 6.42 per day. So what this means is this longer term option, you might not expect to hold it for that whole",

It's something that you put out for a little while with the expectation of taking it down sooner, but this decreases your daily faded decay. Now there's more that goes into the equation than this obviously, but this is something you should consider being out there. See you later.",
