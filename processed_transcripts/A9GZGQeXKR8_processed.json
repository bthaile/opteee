So welcome in everybody. So what time we go? We got like two two that'll be our kickoff. The game plan for today is really simple. The first thing I want to do is run through the markets pretty quick. Maybe spend 20, 30 minutes rolling through seeing what we're seeing. There is, I mean, futures are up right now. So there is a couple of things going on that I think are broadly interesting that we can start with. And then we will pivot from there into this skill development session, which that is now Wednesdays for those wondering what that's all about on Wednesdays now we're spending the tail half very purposefully working on a skill of some sort, not necessarily in a particular order, but the last two kind of are. And then for those that are in the outlier Patreon, the pro side, then tomorrow this will expand into a natural case study where we will go much further into detail and focus more on like the practical application side of things. This is more to introduce the concept. So that everybody",

The skill development segment for later today is going to be about building a scalable trading approach. And there's a bunch of things that I want to talk about with respect to that I was actually taking notes on it last night. And it's because there are a lot of things that go into this process. I have like five major bullet points that I want to talk about. We're going to go through the path that most traders take common mistakes that derail our ability to actually scale our overall trading approach. And then setting a foundation for something that we feel comfortable with scaling. So that's what we will get into on the tail half of the session. Let's see who we got in the house. Looks like we got Hader Reese. We got Tommy Lauren travel. Shame Gar which is becoming quickly one of my favorite things to say. It's just a fun, the fun thing to say I think.

And then we also got dark mark, Paulo, beautiful. We got the gang in town. So let's take a look at the markets as a whole to start. We can see that the SP 500 had a little bit of a down day, but it has been on an absolute tear. So recently hit a high 610 fell off. And now it's been about level set. Big Daddy J. Powell was talking earlier. We held rates. I don't think there was any shock there. Some of his forward guidance, I think is somewhat topical because it started highlighting a little bit more of an uncertainty element for the future, but overall pretty low impact on the market today. I did trade volatility around it because the volatility was still there, but yeah, just not a whole lot. Then for the cues we can see tech is following a very similar pattern. The SP 500 small caps is still just sucking wind. Small caps cannot catch a bid. If we take a look at the movement in IWM on a slightly longer term time frame, actually even better. Let's look at it in here and I'll change this grid. We'll do like a four by. And then let's do spy. Let's do QQQ. Let's do IWM. And let's zoom",

And then let's do spy. Let's do QQQ. Let's do IWM. And let's zoom these out. Notice the difference. Everything from the slope of the standard deviation channels out to the behavior that you see in this entire time frame. Small caps have been in a massively, massively, massively consolidated position for some time now. So you can see if we take a look at IWM down here, it's essentially been range bound in this time frame here. And then it started rallying up and out just a bit. But even on this move in terms of severity, it's very light. So if we grab from like the midpoint there, go to the midpoint here, about 13 move from when it actually started to rally. If we take a look at the comparison from spy in the same thing, 44 move. So small caps have not been the place to be for several years now, realistically. Qs is 51. The reason why I bring this up is because when we're trying to figure out, especially for me, when I'm trading something like the coverage triangle, I have to figure out where the money should be, where's the best place to commit the capital for obviously the optimal return that I can find.

And it's not small caps. And small caps are becoming a bigger question mark for me to be honest with you. Now, if you take a look in terms of volatility, small caps absolutely maintains much higher volatility. This is on display in terms of why I generally like to trade something like IWM is if you take a look at the average daily ranges or average true ranges, like you say in this scenario, they're much higher than the other two. And it is much better diversified. The problem is is that even something like IWM is going to be tied to what the broader economic landscape looks like and what the broader economic landscape looks like right now, obviously is very rate focused and rates are kind of like the kryptonite for small cap companies, small banks, all of those kinds of entities that exist there. So that becomes really important to keep in mind. From when you decide to start coming up with thematic positions, we can kind of identify that small caps are a questionable place for more thematic positions right now. You can find volatility there.

Let's see if anything sticks out to us. Palm services up big. Financial is hitting new highs. I still do I still have that on? Yes. I still have the visa ratio called diagonal right now. It's just long calls. But I still have that on. And there was a couple that I put on over yesterday following up on the stream yesterday. There is some stuff that we saw some really interesting unusual options activity in. But overall, not anything looking too spicy, but financials are something to keep an eye on for upside because now it's essentially challenging prior highs. Obviously, it posted term highs here on a three-month time frame. But the you can see that it reeled back on this little tiny candle. So if it can sustain that, then all of a sudden, financials start to look another interesting place to start allocating money along with comm services for upside plays, industrials rolling over.

And Nvidia right now is I haven't re-drawn these from when we first looked at this, right? And essentially saying this looks like the range that it needs to figure out where it wants to break in. And I have to be honest with you, I thought on this breakout, I thought today it would have had a little more continuation that did not see. So that starts to add some questions in my mind is to why would we have had this really strong update and then just a complete lack of follow-through on the next day? Like that, that I really think is slightly telling. And telling in terms of the way that people are trying to position in something like Nvidia, people are not super ultra-bullet in here right now, unfortunately, which is a pretty big change compared to what it was in the beginning. Also, is the stream laggy at all for you guys? Because I'm looking at the little, I'm looking at OBS and it looks generally okay, but",

Because I'm looking at the little, I'm looking at OBS and it looks generally okay, but after that issue yesterday, I want to make sure that it's actually behaving as it should. I might need to turn this down potentially. Overall is stream coming through decent? Okay, cool. Thanks, Paula. Yeah, great. So that's how I'm thinking about Nvidia. Range bound here until we see a clear break above either of these. Once we see a clear break above either of these, then I think we start to have a defined trend that can be traded either direction up or down. Now, still for longer term investors, unequivocally, great investment opportunity. I still think this is a great investment opportunity. There's the way to think about this from an investor's lens is in five years, is Nvidia likely going to be worth more now, worth more than than it is now. And I would feel pretty confident making that wager to the upside. And that's just because of how well Nvidia has been positioned to be involved in essentially everything that happens with all of the technological technological innovation that's occurring right now between AI, AGI, general robot, like every sort of big adoption or innovation within tech is essentially using some sort of Nvidia product,",

So from an investor's perspective, to me, this is like a no brainer for traders. Again, we need to see some sort of movement. And right now, it's not really showing a whole lot of that from a risk premium perspective. It doesn't look good, not touching it from there. And what I mean by that is the total amount of risk premium given to the to the average size moves that you're seeing on a daily basis is crazy. So if you take a look at the average daily range for a five day window, it's six point eight three percent average daily range. This is not average true range, is average daily range. And average daily range does not take into account these giant gaps overnight. It's talking about the daily move in trade day. So six point eight three percent on a five day average ADR. Take a look at the 90 day three point six three. So it is massive volatility compared to what it tends to be. And right now, it's not really being priced then enough from a",

And right now, it's not really being priced then enough from a short-term vol trading perspective. Unfortunately, because otherwise, I would much prefer to be able to trade something like this. These are where you can get really, really interesting opportunities from a vol trading perspective, but not always. And it's because right now, it's still just moving too much. It needs to chill TF out before it starts to look more attractive. Take a look at the average true range, which is five days nine point four one percent. The 90 day is four point four two percent over double the average true range, which obviously accounts for overnight gaps. So volatility and Nvidia has jacked up significantly. And while it's doing that trending sideways, it can look kind of lucrative from a vol traders perspective. But my hunch is sooner or later, it's going to get a break one way or the other. And I still have to maintain a slightly longer term. I mean, a slightly bullish leaning in it just because of the company and where it's at. But yeah, we'll see.

Unfortunately, I was hoping to see a little bit more of a kickoff for positive drift, which isn't the case right now. So I'll actually drop a couple alerts here to see if it does end up breaking. I still have a long side bias in so if I don't have a position on it right now. But my general bias is more long. But again, just right now, not really suitable for a position.

We'll do the ADW. And then we'll do Nvidia. Yeah, I don't really think so. Nvidia had that big drop on the 27th. And this had an update on the 27th. I'm just curious why it's down so big today. It's down almost 4. Anyways, I don't really care that much. I'm just curious. Weird. Let's take a look at a pounce here. Better but not good still. I really don't care for how this support is just teetering out as it gets up towards this top. Let's take a look at a couple other examples of recent directional moves. Here. So DVN, we talked about this. We talked about a perspective breakdown below this specific candle, which starts to signify, in my opinion, a lot of downside weakness. And we actually got, not a big move, but we got an okay move in a relatively short-term timeframe. Now, the cool part is with options, you don't need a big move. That's the whole point of trading options for directional stuff as you gain leverage. So in this case, it actually worked out",

But this is something that like had a clear break and then continue through the break. Today, it's consolidating. I've already exited the trade, but this still looks generally downside focused. And there's some some pretty clear continuation in that direction. This is strange. We see a rally, gap down rally, back up. Like that's just really strange stock behavior. And it is coming into earnings, which another thing that you typically see for for companies as they're coming into the earnings cycle is they kind of trend sideways coming into earnings more often than not, barring other news, not being there and stuff like that. So that's just another element in here that drives at least some level of curiosity from my perspective. This still isn't suitable for a directional trade, again, for my trading windows. Longer trading windows, again, probably fine. I think balance here is probably really, really, really well positioned in a longer-term timeframe. But I think on a shorter-term timeframe, it's not ready yet. The name of trading is striking a balance between learning when to trade and when not to trade.

    "text": "probably really, really, really well positioned in a longer-term timeframe. But I think on a shorter-term timeframe, it's not ready yet. The name of trading is striking a balance between learning when to trade and when not to trade. And there are plenty of periods where it's literally better off not putting a trade on in something even if you have an idea behind it or some sort of thesis. Again, like, balance here, if somebody were to ask me where do I think it'll be in three years, I think it'll be higher for sure. And the reason why I think that is just because of where it sits in terms of the contracting space and it's doing a good job nessling up to the money printer that is federal government. But short-term sentiment and short-term sentiment is a little bit sporadic here, which I can't help but find slightly curious. Let's take a quick look at futures. So E-minis are up a little bit. Russell is up almost half a point kind of leading, which is fucking weird. Nasdaq is up almost half a point. That doesn't make sense to me on a relative basis. Vicks down half a point. Bitcoin still hovering around that 100,000 range. Gold really not changing crude up just a little bit, but massive downtrend. My guess is you'll continue to see crude run down. Actually, that leads me to a need to drop an alert in here. I had a crude trade",

And then I took it down, but I still think with the overall near-term expectation for Trump policies is obviously likely oil prices will continue to contract to a degree. Net gas big gap down. Fucking everybody's day up as net gas does. When from 37 down to 31 ish. Good. You trade net gas. You should never be happy. That's the nature of trading that gas. And corn is still on an absolute tear. Curious. Very, very curious. Cool. So let's take a look at overall market internals now. And see if anything sticks out to us here. I don't know about this whole meta. The Zuck rebrand has been fucking crazy. He really does look like a straight fuck boy. Like at first, I thought that there was a couple joke, adult-erred images that were put up of him. But like he really is not to comment. I don't know. It's like I'm not trying to comment on his looks because I don't care that much, but he does have that vibe. Like he really, really does have that vibe, which is just, I don't know if it's just me.

Be the year when a highly intelligent personalized AI assistant reaches more than one billion. I expect meta AI to be the leading AI assistant. So they came in, god damn, 20.8 billion. It's just so much fucking money. 802 a share solid, up 50. You're over here. Man, you want to talk about like driving value. Revenue is up 21. Here's the crazy thing. These companies have been growing at this pace for some time now. It is insane. How sustained these moves have been. Absolutely insane. Market is showing up like 20 points. It was expected out of 50 point moves. So right now within the expected move on the straddle. But man, what an absolute crush. They were expecting 676 and they came in at 802. So again, this might be a case where we could see we could see post earnings announcement drift even in mega cap companies, which has become more and more rare. Which is just so strange.

They were asking me like, what would I do if the YouTube channel started to like, actually blow up, meaning just like really aggressively grow. Because right now it's been growing at a very steady rate and it's become like a comfort zone for me, right? Because when we do streams, I see familiar names. This is like a little little safe space, right? Comfortable. But you can just like expect if things started to scale massively, how much stuff that starts to change. One of the things that's really cool about being a smaller YouTuber is most people that pay attention to the content. They actually care about the content and the information and they understand the angle that I'm coming from and so on and so forth, which that's not the case.

That becomes down like in my opinion, that's tied to more stuff like power or just cerebral interest in something, whatever it is. But there's absolutely other drivers than just trying to make more money. Like he has more than he ever, yeah, he is more than he ever could have needed, which again, that's also why I'm so confused about the thing when he went on Joe Rogan and he was talking about how he he wasn't comfortable with what the federal government was asking him to do around the COVID vaccines and all that kind of stuff. But it's like, I just don't understand if you're that uncomfortable, why the fuck did you not make the decision then when it mattered versus now? That I just really don't understand. So and I probably won't. There's obviously a lot that he's thinking about and contending with that none of us will have any idea of. But I just find that all very strange. But like this, I think, is interesting, right? Because we're starting to get an understanding of where he's waiting things and what he really wants to see grow and what he wants meta to continue to become. Because if you remember, the whole idea of meta was tied to the metaverse, which I haven't heard shit about the metaverse. I don't know if",

But I think I'm trying to understand more and more about where the companies trying to take things. Mel got me these meta. What the fuck is it? These meta, it's like these meta ray bands.

I want to know what most of their values currently come. There you go. 97 from core Facebook advertising. I wouldn't have expected this to be honest with you. I knew. I absolutely knew that advertising obviously would be a dominant part of the business for sure. I didn't realize that it would be like 97 of the business. I thought that they would have some other some other irons in the fire. This does start to make a little more sense though with the decisions made during COVID. If you think of it from trying to protect this is the core business model. I can actually start to see that a little bit wild. Absolutely wild. So yeah, it's primarily from ads.

So next, create a list of large wildfire dates that impacted California. The reason why I'm taking the time to do this with you guys just in case like this is how you come up with ideas. This is exactly how you come up with ideas. This would be a less utilized idea potentially. But nonetheless, this is the process of being a trader and looking for effects that you can trade. This will be called the California wildfire effect. So what I'm doing is I want to see if there's a normalized relationship between these. So there's PCG. So we'll have symbol or ticker. PCG. SCE. SRE. EIX. EWT which is water. SJW which is water. So these are Nat gas electricity. These two are water. Okay. Provide the specific date fire started for each. So now what I'm doing is I'm figuring out the actual date that each started. So fire date. Format as a table. Conclude the little acreage and estimated. Well, so what we're going to do.

Well, so what we're going to do. Lightly reformat. I could have just used transpose but it can be in a simple tip. This is actually probably the decent focus. All right. Let's. Perfect. So right now you can see I'm essentially using chat GPT to help me. I'm figuring out when the actual dates were. I'm figuring out the total severity for each fire. And then I'm figuring out whatever the estimated cost was. Associated with each. And then what we can do is we can take a look at the ticker performance around these individual days. Now if I were to and this from a date at like an actual data analysis perspective, what I would be doing is just grabbing the stock data for each of these and quickly overlaying them. We literally can just eyeball it really fast. Just because I don't want to burn too much more time on this here. This will be something I'll probably finish as an extra curricular, you know, for for your boy. But let's take a look at a really long-term timeframe. We'll look at 10 year Jesus. We'll take a look at a 10 year monthly. And let's take a look at. So January 7th obviously, let's take a look at 13 July of 21. 21 here. So",

Do you notice something so far? Like this is actually already something that I care about. So there's a clear effect here. Just fucking eyeball in one of these. Let's go to do one more. Men to see no, hey, that's not that far. That was a small one, 250,000,000,000. But that one is 27 July 18. That one didn't register. And then 4d 17. No shit. That's kind of big. If you look at the largest candles on this, at least a not significant sample of them are tied to wildfires. So I'm actually going to stop doing this so that we can take a look at this more closely together. But what I can tell you, that's a tradable effect, like for sure. Super fucking interesting. There you go. Pro tip on how to create and find tradable effects. Now let's pivot over and let's talk about this other topic. We'll keep that on our scratch. And let's add another scratch.

Now the session for today is specifically tied to figuring out how to develop a scalable approach. And there's a few things I want to cover first. And then there are a bunch of questions and stuff that I have for you. So if you are able to type in, I would love if you're able to type in as we go through this because I want to kind of tailor this depending on the responses that we get. I think that that's generally more interesting and more useful, hopefully for you. So let's take a look at this. We have to grab our little drone pad. Here we go. Let's talk about this. What does this mean? A scalable trading approach. As always, we're going to start with an orientation. In a nutshell, this entire concept is to try and give more context for the average trader so that they make better decisions. The average trader will very often kind of commit a series of absolutely terrible choices. And it looks a lot like I'm just going to grab a trading account and I'm going to start trading and I'm going to hope that it works. Right. That's the idea. And the reality is obviously that's not how trading works. It's just not how this",

So the idea of trying to build a scalable trading approach is as we talk about all the time, the basics, right. Understanding the challenge like all that kind of shit. I don't really want to belabor those points because they've been made clear. I think for as many times as we talked about it. But here's the the cliff notes version for like this very high level opening concept. Markets. Offer. Big rewards. Here's the deal. You can make more than a fucking doctor. You can make more than a lawyer. You can make more than a doctor and a lawyer fucking combined. You absolutely can. It is a thing. The probability of that happening is not super high. There's a lot of nuance that goes into that. But the point is is that it is a truly possible scenario. I have. And I am a fucking idiot, which is hilarious. Very funny to me. The broader point though is markets allow a scalability that is not available other places. Even if you are a highly successful attorney, right.

Meanwhile, creating my opinion is actually best done in this fashion. Just like every other fucking career. It is a stair step pattern that's built on progressive expansion of our skills up until the point of your skill cap, not gap, cap. That's what's going to shortchange you from being able to take the next step is whatever your skill cap is. That skill cap can come in a lot of different shapes and forms. It can come from you being such a good trader that you make a bunch of money, you scale your account, and you scale the account so much that you no longer can trade the things that you traded in order to scale the account.

    "text": "It can come from you being such a good trader that you make a bunch of money, you scale your account, and you scale the account so much that you no longer can trade the things that you traded in order to scale the account. That could happen. That's not the case for most people, but that can happen. The point is the idea of building a scalable trading approach is embracing this trajectory. The whole point of accepting this upfront is so that we can build a process that allows us to do this. What does that mean? Well, it means that our starting goal is not to take the 10,000 account we have in turn that into 10,000,000. It's accepting the fact that there's going to be a lot of things that has to happen between these two points. Let's talk about how we can set up our growth trajectory to then scale appropriately. We have to clear all this out. We know all of the basics at this point. I'm not going to belabor the points of trading plan, trading logs, risk management. I'm taking all of that for granted here, like the fundamentals of being a trader. Essentially, if we think of the starting point over here, starting point, I am talking to your you and this group as if we are about here. I would consider this year one to three somewhere in that time frame. This is again where we have the basics out",

We've now we've gone through this stage over here, which really is typically sub-year, I think is pretty fair. I call this blissful ignorance. This is where we tend to think this is going to be easy, this is going to be fast easy money. We're going to be able to just do this with low effort. We're going to trade this one strategy and we're going to make a ton of money. No problem. It's super easy. Blissful ignorance. That's this shaded area and this shaded area also happens to be where we start to see the overwhelming of majority of traders fail. Again, call this the 90 and then as we know, the five-year time frame, this is where the total attrition typically rises to the total of 95 ish, where then you have a 5 remaining ish, cohort of traders that have figured it out within this time frame have built something that they can continue to maintain and grow.

That's supposed to be an s, not a five. I don't know why defaulted to that. We have a start and then over here, we're going to call this professional. Now for professional, there's not really a time amount. I'm ballparking it. Like we say in the Marine Corps, we trade into a standard, not to a time. You can become a professional faster than this, but for context, typically mastery is around the 10,000 hour mark for skilled effects. Again, give or take and for context that essentially is five hours per day for five and a half years without missing a single day. That's how you hit 10,000 hours. Yet most traders again mistakenly think that they're going to somehow hit mass really level within the first five years. But let's talk about this first five year mark that I talk about this fabled five year mark. Now this again is blissful ignorance. And this is essentially going to be coupled with randomness, mistakes. And the blissful ignorance section, I think, is about one year.

You're just kind of fucking around and probably losing money. Like that's what's happening in this first year mark for most people. Now there are some people that take a different path. I absolutely did myself. And this is one of my very, very sincere hopes. This is why I'm doing this at 1,800 Anna. What is today? Wednesday night with you all is my sincere hope is to try to expose people to this sooner so that we don't have to waste this much time and money to figure out that there's some shit that we got to do in order to make this work. So now we come to an important turn after the first year marker. So and this is where I call the overwhelmed phase. And that essentially spans somewhere in here. The overwhelmed phase is kind of specific. This is typically post-gunning career. This is generally when we start to identify the challenge. We understand the opportunity.

It's going to be tied with hesitation. And essentially this is the analogy that I think makes sense. I'm kind of making it up as I go. So it might not be the best analogy but work work with me. I'm thinking of it as imagine you're walking on a tightrope. And let's say that you stand on the tightrope or maybe it's like two by fours. Right. So it's maybe more applicable to people. Most people can walk on a two by four. And you're walking on two by fours and you're just kind of having some fun. You look down, you can see the ground on both sides. So it's low risk. If you fall off the two by fours, you're good, right? You just kind of walk on these two by fours because it's fun to balance. What ends up happening in the trading analogy is that some point you look down and you realize that it's not the fucking ground. It's fog. It's something else.

We don't want to take the next step because that one might make us fall. This is one where in the overwhelmed phase. And there's a couple things we can do to overcome it. I got to pop the door for Thor.

    "text": "is likely where a lot of people come across the outlier community, my community. And this is also probably where you start to get overwhelmed plus plus. Meaning even more overwhelmed. Because now we know that there's a lot of work to do. There's a long way to go. This stuff's complex. And then you're going to start hearing terms you don't know. You're going to understand that there's a whole other level to this stuff that you didn't know exists. You're going to see the business side of trading, which is kind of ugly. It's going to look like research, which is time consuming. It's going to look like trading plans, trading logs, AARs, all this shit that you have to do. And you're like, damn, damn. Not only do I have to learn the fucking markets, but there's all this shit that I don't even know where to go. I don't even fucking know where to go from here. This is the this is the cohort we're talking to today specifically. Because once you're past this stage, you're kind of good. You're generally on a glide slope. And if I grab the website really quick to give you an example of this. And I think it's on this one. Yeah. And if we take a look at essentially the Dunning Kruger effect as it exists here, you'll notice that we have the skill gap peak, Mountstupid, whatever you want to call it.

But the main point is that you start finding that this is doable. There's a way to approach it. That's scalable. That we can maintain going forward. That will eventually get us to where we're trying to go. So the hope is to tackle this stage where we need to start turning things into action in order to see the outputs that we want. So this is again specifically for this overwhelmed group, typically. So let's talk about the overwhelmed group and what's going on here. My guess is there's no shortage of you in the stream right now that have felt this or do feel this. So let me ask you, what are the main contributors to feeling overwhelmed? My guess is that there will be quite a few to pick from. So I would love to hear some of your thoughts. There is a bunch that come to mind.

So Thor heard something in the house. He thought it was Mel getting home. She's not home. So I opened the door to let him out. And then I closed the door again. And now he's scratching out the door because he's like, well, Dave, I went out. I look, there's nobody here. But now I want to come back in, bro. EHODGE says, no true understanding of concepts. So lack of competence. Re says learning one thing shows five things to learn. Fear of losing. Travel says too many choices. Lauren says legs are too fucking long. Jamgar says made it too difficult to fast. Let's. Huns notice how many inputs there are here to this concept of being overwhelmed. Now the cool part is like any sort of really big problem we can break it up into smaller pieces and then we can successfully navigate it. So we'll talk about that in a second. I",

So if we go to we'll probably have to end in like at least 20 minutes so that I can feed this beast. So let's talk about three big fixes here. So first one, these are the three that I have listed out. One is two many voices. Two literally looking at my notes that I wrote out. Niles is paralysis. Three complexity. To me, the overwhelming number of inputs to being overwhelmed stem from these three buckets. And we've talked about a really simple framework before we're getting better at this thing. So let's talk about too many choices. Too many choices is stuff like you're trying to do everything. You're switching stuff at random. You're trying to redesign everything from your own perspective. Your own lens instead of leveraging what exists. It's when you can't create order out of the number of potential avenues because there's so many different avenues to pick. It's those kinds of things.

It's when you can't create order out of the number of potential avenues because there's so many different avenues to pick. It's those kinds of things. Analysis paralysis is when you begin testing something or exploring something or learning something. And then you get into this unhealthy cycle where it becomes ad nauseam. You are just doing it over and over and over again in all these different permutations. And it's this process that continues to grow voraciously. And then for complexity, it's when we continue to try and add more elements to what we're doing in order to make it better. But it begins to slow us down in the broader sense because now there's an additional thing we have to do. Maybe RSI will make this strategy better. Well, now you have to go look at RSI and all the different instances. Yeah, it does. Oh, wow. I wonder how RSI would do compared to slow the castics. Let me go look at that and then so on and so forth. So there are some really simple fixes genuinely for all of these. And again, we're going to go over them now.

This it's just a progression and we can outline and build the progression together.

And the reason why I'm telling you this on this stream is if you you should do that. And it's because I think going through that exercise is what starts to turn this stuff into action versus just ideation, which is good. But sooner or later you get us to start doing some shit. So let's talk about how we overcome too many choices. The easiest way to overcome too many choices first step is define objectives. We have to be specific.

It adds no clarity because it's so superficial. So an example of trying to action on this and take it further is essentially what we talked about last week starting with the money mindset exercise. And it doesn't have to be that it can be anything. But the point is to start with an actual in-depth analysis of what the fuck you're trying to do. So here's an example of a good objective. Right now I am a person I've been saving a little bit. Let's say I have 25k. And let's say that I've been trading for four years now. I have a good job. I'm able to save a certain amount of money. Let's say I can save on average 800 per month. And I'm trying to figure out when the fuck can I retire?

Let's say in this scenario, I don't know I have no idea what metrics apply to these numbers to be honest like what age this would be. If you have any idea for an average maybe what 20. This would probably be high for a 25 year old. This would probably be okay. Let's do like a 25 year old. I'm just fucking guessing but their savings aren't going to be this. I don't know what a 25 year old savings would be maybe 500 a month. Because at that point you should be in like a decent job. And we're trying to figure out how long do we have to do this game? How long do I have to keep sucking up to a boss that I don't really like or doing things that I don't really like in order to make a living and you know escape this rat race? Perfect time to define your objectives. So the objective is pretty easy. The objective is financial freedom. Okay. So now we have to do some more homework. We need to quantify what that means. And for those that are in the outlier trading pairs program when I had you all work on the financial or the the money mindset exercise and then the millionaire roadmap.

This is where people get gummed up. This is why we get stuck with too many choices is because we're sitting here letting ideas swirl around all these ideas, all these things that we want to do. But we're not taking the time to actually sit down and think about one of them through its entirety to what we need. And what you need from the objective of financial freedom is you need to quantify how much money you need. That's what you need.

It's literally why I built this calculator. It's because I use it straight up all the time. So we have 2500 bucks. We're saving on average 500 per month. Right now we're 25 so we got at least 20 years in the in the pipeline. And current rate of return 10. Let's say that we get like a 5 variance off of that. And let's see where that places us. Well, that places us in 20 years at 511 thousand dollars. And if we said that we want 7000 dollars per month, we need to figure out what a reasonable rate of return would be required to achieve that. Now let's add that into our model. So 7000 dollars per month, we're going to need some sort of return in order to hit that. If we think about average market return, it's about 8. If you're trading and doing this, ideally, we're outperforming that, but we want to plan conservatively. So maybe we plan using something like 8, 8 target return. Now we literally just have essentially an equation we need to solve for. We need to figure out at what principle amount earning 8 per year gives us 7000 dollars per month.

This is another really common issue. There we go. Crude oil is dipping again. You guys see that? Yeah. About time to place a trade, eh? So if we take a look at what, 1.25 million, multiply that by 08. That's 100,000 divided by 12, gives us 8,300. So it's a little high, maybe 1150 times 0.092 divided by 1276. That's about right. So we need essentially 1.5, 0, 0, 0. This is what we need in order for this target. So now the question becomes back to our model. How do we get that? Well, I'm 25. I'm going to have 20 more years. I'm a young professional. I take a look at the comps in my career field. And I see what's possible if I continue on the glide slope. If it looks like for the next 20 years, it's going to be about what it is now. And I can't save anymore because of whatever reason. Maybe I need to look at expanding my timeline a little bit.

This is the worst case scenario. So based on this timeline, it looks like it'll probably be not, didn't mean that. It'll be about 26 years in the worst case scenario based on current balance, steady contributions that we've accounted for over the next 20 years on average, using a current expected return of 10 and cool.

Maybe we can instead of 10 on average per year, we can earn 15. Well, if I take a look at 15, where do I see that crossover for 1.1 million? I see it the 15 handle that occur here at year 20. So if I can hit that 15 return per year, maintain that for 20 years, along with the rest of the metrics from a savings perspective, I can cut six years off of this. So this is the broader planning perspective. I don't want to get too gummed up here because we don't have too much longer. But I'm giving you a literally specific example on how to actually build the goals that feed into this broader process. That's what that is. So we define our objectives, we quantify them, and then we actually have something to plan off of. From a trading perspective, now we have answers. From a trading perspective, we now know how much money we need to make on average per month in order to earn that 10 or that 15 whatever the target is. So then we start from core principles. We don't worry about what ticker to trade. We don't worry about what expiration is best. We start with profit mechanisms. We start with how things actually make money. And then we steadily dial in",

How do we develop that confidence? The way we develop that confidence is by starting with things that we know work and exist. Market exhibits positive drift. I just told you what the average market return is per year. Why is it that the average market return per year 8 to 12 depending on the time frame is what it is. But then so many traders can't be greater than fucking zero. Why is that? It's because the trader thinks they're better than that. They think, well, if I'm going to waste the time doing this, I should get a better return than that. That's a completely viable goal in the long term, but you're not better than that in the beginning. The market return is a great starting point because we know it's there and we know it's persistent. Then you can start building off of that if you're so inclined. But the market return is a great place to start. Whether you choose to expose yourself to that through direct beta, buying an index ETF, and then slightly optimizing it through a coverage triangle, or maybe you start to take a little bit more beta to get a better return and trade a leverage ETF.

Rather than buying hold, which will have really big down years, can I make this just marginally better? Maybe I don't have to have the same draw downs than the market. That can accelerate it quite a lot for me, actually. So we start there. Notice how this starts peeling away, analysis paralysis. This starts adding a lot of specificity to the complexity that exists because there is a defined path that we're trying to take that starts slow and then can ramp over time. The reason why this starts slow using a market return or something like that is because it's accessible and it's what you get essentially for doing nothing but taking the risk. You can use that as a planning factor. Then while you're looking to optimize or slightly enhance your market risk, then you can start tinkering with different ideas. You can be paper trading in the background. You can live test ideas and you can see maybe there's other things you can monetize.

We'll pick whatever it is. We'll figure out what our objective is. We'll make it relevant to the people on the stream. And then we will literally get specific. We'll say, okay, how do we gain the market beta to start? What would make sense? How do we slightly optimize the market beta? What makes sense?

What's not sustainable is randomly bouncing around, hoping that something is going to work. And if you don't know upfront what might work, you're already starting the game on hard mode. We already know what works. You can see it. You can see research about it. Momentum works. Post earnings announcement drift works. Market beta works. And if you don't like these ones because the returns aren't good enough for you, then guess what? You need to figure out something else that works better. Do that work then. If you don't know what else works and you're not sure what a start, guess what? You're not too good for these other effects that we know work. You're not too good for you can start there and then you could build your skill set as you grow. This is how we get through this overwhelmed stage where we're scared. We don't know what to do next.

This is exactly the core concepts to apply to that. And then tomorrow we'll go through again, like the broader case study. But before we hop off, I want to see if there's any specific questions on what we talked about. Any areas that we are not clear on, I want to make sure that if you're going to try to do this exercise on your own, that you feel comfortable with what you want to try to do so that it at least makes sense. EHODGE says get nine streams revenue so you can save and study at the same time. Honestly, joking aside, if you look at the the millionaire roadmap, and if you look at the broader approach that I talk about taking to do this, like the actual path to become a millionaire, there's three primary levers you get to pull on. The first lever is your savings rate, meaning how much of your income are you saving. The second is your income. How much money do you make? How can you make it better? The third is your investing returns. How good are you at trading and investing to amplify the annual returns?

Right? We don't want to wait 26 years. That's too long. Guess what, bitch? Get better. Make more money. Do something else. Well, I don't want to go back to school. That's annoying to make more money. Okay, bitch. Then wait 26 years. I still don't want to do that. That's a little bit too long. Okay, bitch. Get better at trading then. Well, I'm difficult. I really don't want to spend that much time on it. I really want to have my freedom. I don't want to be in front of a screen. This is what people do. This is the exact dialogue people have with themselves because they are trying to just build something that is purely optimal for them, not accepting the fact that in order to do this whole thing, it takes them compromise. So figure out the compromise. Be comfortable with it. If you can do that, that's why there's so much opportunity here.

Then that's why the opportunity is still there for you. Be thankful. It's difficult. I try to remind people of that exact concept. If this was not difficult, the opportunity would not be there. It would be priced out. The fact that it's difficult, you should be thankful for. I'm thankful for that. Plus also admittedly, it's kind of easy for me now. So it's easy for me to say that. Sorry. Oh, Lauren just hooked up five people with outlier trading memberships. Thank you so much, Lauren. We're hooking some people up and supporting the channel. We very much appreciate it.
