I feel like when I'm talking casually, it's like a normal voice then whenever introduced somebody I really try to lay it on for you. Yeah, that's good. That's good. Your voice good. Well, it's great to see you again. I always enjoy the opportunity to pick your brain a little bit, see what you're thinking about things. Today, I want to do two things. I wanted to first pick your brain about current markets, obviously. But then I also wanted to spend a little bit of time towards the middle slash later half of the session talking a little bit more about like the beginner trader paradigm and the way that you think about some different elements around that. So I figured we'd start with the broad market, though. What's stuck out to you today other than the fact that we we did get a down tick. I know that that's something that you tend to look for. Well, probably what stuck out the most to me today was that there was there was no two sided trade. I mean, it was down from the opening bell and they, you know, it feels like for most of 2024, whenever they were down, when they opened lower, there was always some kind of rally or head fake or whatever. And today it felt like, you know, there",

And today it felt like, you know, there was none of the above. There wasn't an uptick all day. So I think that was the biggest difference for me is that I was kind of waiting. I was kind of waiting to see if they would, you know, try to bounce them or at least have a little bit of a rally at different points and that was pretty ugly all day. Yeah, it was really interesting. I thought too, because to me, it seemed like we started getting some earnings coming out, being ingested and obviously tech was leading the pack down to me, it seemed like tech is in a spot where it essentially has to deliver almost perfectly or exceed on earnings in order for the market not have this kind of response, but how do you look at that? Well, the market's been hyperbolic this year and it's been really tightly concentrated. So for me, you know, I, I just look at it as we were grossly overbought. I mean, personally, I wish we went down last month because that's when I had more bullets to the downside, but I didn't reload all my, you know, downside positions, which I'm sorry about. But, you",

But, you know, again, I, I think it's, I think it's long overdue. I think a sell off of this nature is long overdue. You know, that's all. That's fair enough. Now, how do you get a sense of when it's due versus overdue? Because I also know the last time it's not, it's not even you can't. It's just, it's something that, you know, I mean, in this business, of course timing is everything. But given the magnitude of the up move this year, there's absolutely no way you could catch this down move because like I caught this down move a little bit, but I've also got caught in the last three stages of the up move, which I already thought we're overbought. So it doesn't get you back to even so it's not even worth it. You know, so, so yeah, you can catch a little bit of the down move, but, but at the same time, you know, you're fighting. You probably put yourself in that position three or four times already this year when it just ran, you know, basically ran over your face.

I mean, I got some money back in the last month, but it was crappy. You know, like, you know, when you get your face ripped off, it's hard to, you know, you got to be careful about throwing good money after bad. You know, I thought Nvidia was overpriced when it got to 650. I didn't think it was going to, you know, 1100 and then split it. Right. Yeah. And so then that is my follow up question though. When you look at something where it does seem like the market does start to agree with your thesis is now at your point it's too late to move kind of already started to unwind or do you like, well, it really depends on the situation. It depends on the, you know, on the year that it happens and when it happens. Video now.

So you're kind of wondering, you know, you're always looking over your shoulder, you're not, you're not firing from a position of strength as a trader. So I think the best thing to do is to kind of just, you know, get back as much as you can and then start from, you know, start thinking kind of clearly again. Don't make it, don't make it, don't let it be personal. That's for sure. Right. That makes a ton of sense. So what other kind of things do you look at now? Like in today's market, what interests you for trade ideas? Well, I looked at a lot of things today. I mean, I know there were some people nibbling on the buy side.

But I also look for some things I think are, you know, like as we closed the, I thought the bonds got kind of cheap when they traded down to 118. And that was a by point for me. So, you know, I got a little bit long bonds. I will mess around with things I think are very oversold. But I'm not trying to fade. I'm a contrarian, but I wasn't ready to fade this move yet. Got it. And what do you think about smalls? I know last time we spoke, you were bullish in them in I remember that distinctly because I had a super bullish in the small caps. Relative to everything else.

I held it, but most people can. Yeah, well, I started using just kind of trailing stops to make it a little easier for me to scale myself out a little bit. But luckily it was essentially parabolic. What did you make of that move, though? Because to me that that was actually it makes sense to me. I mean, Paris, Paris are the only things that actually, you know, that I bet on to normalize and price. And I mean, it shouldn't take this long. But the back, the back has been broken now.

So it looks like year to date the SP 500 is up 14.63 cues are up 14.2. So does that like does that mean anything to you? I was a little surprised to see that starting to rotate like that. No, did it normalize a little bit now it doesn't mean that got it. Okay. I mean, I'm not that granular in my trading, you know, like I'm short, both of them that cues and the spy. So. And then do you wait them differently or is it just they, but you get a short, you get a short. Yeah, don't care. No, I wait them based on IVR. So it's just, you know, my biggest position right now is an I WM, but only because of IVR. So it's all short premium and I WM. Got it makes sense.

What do you think of it makes sense doesn't make sense. The bond movement recently has made sense to me because I'm not. I'm a buyer of bonds on any dip, but I'm not really bullish on bonds. I think they're going to trade in a, in a really narrow range under one 18 kind of where they close today right around that one 18 level. I like the bonds under one 18. I love the bonds at one 15 or one 16. I'm okay with the bonds at one 17 or one 18. I'm not a buyer at one 19 or 120. So that shows you I'm a very, I'm in a very tight range here. I'm a buyer, you know, one or two handles lower than one or two points lower than here. I'm a seller, you know, one 20, one, one, 22. So I think the bonds are in a very tight range. I think the bonds are the only thing that has been somewhat politicized and, you know, I'm guessing, I'm guessing that the bond market will.

The move that it made, what was it like a year ago from like 127 to like 107 or something like that 130 to 105 forgot. Can you contextualize that for me like over the course of your career. How does that kind of move stack up for you? Well, that was a pretty, that was a pretty heavy down move, you know, what it got when it broke under 120 and went down to, you know, 107 108, that that was pretty significant because it was relentless over a short period of time. But I don't think I think it paled in comparison to the up move from, you know, 130 to 170. And so the up move was absolutely frickin violent. The down move was was more of like, you know, we were all like I know myself in a bunch of other chairs, we started to get long in that 112 113 down to 109 area. And by the time we got through 109, we were way too long already, but, but I liked that area. And you know, it obviously tortured us at 106107, but it didn't last every long went straight back to 120. On",

On the down move when bonds went higher and interest rates went lower, that move from, you know, from 125 130 to 170, that was violent. And it never corrected for like the longest period of time and the yield curve inverted in the process. So that was just frickin nasty. Yeah. So now with it hanging around like 118, where do you see normalize price as the rate environment changes? Or do you think that this is just operating? I think the rate environment, the rate environment is all predicated on what the bonds to 116, they had there's no rate cut at 118, there's one. And at 120, there's probably two. I think it's just totally dependent on where bonds go. If they're stuck here at 118, you know, don't count on much at all, maybe a crappy little one lot, rate cut, one, one rate cut. But if they get down to 116, I don't even think you'll see a rate cut. And if they pop back up over 120, it could be one or two.

So then, and then they got up to I think like 125, where was that like the beginning of 25126? Yeah, they did. So like, but there was no rate changes much during that, at least to the cutting side. So like, when does the bond price move would become informative of rates? Whenever the Fed has to get together and talk about rates, the bond prices are the Fed is never going to fade bond prices. It's mathematically impossible. Like if bonds are dropping, the Fed cannot lower rates. If bonds are rising, you know, price, the Fed cannot raise rates. It's period, the end of the story. The marketplace drives the Fed. The Fed does not drive the marketplace. So in this case, the Fed is the Fed is not driving the car. The bond market's driving the car. The Fed's in the passenger seat. It's always been that way and it always will be that way. The Fed is just a is just symbolic. It's just a figurehead for what what's happening to bond market.

Well, for me, I care from a contextual standpoint, trying to understand that relationship. Like when the Fed is sitting down looking at rates, how do they, you know, we're obviously saying bond informs Fed, that makes sense. I follow that. Yeah, but I'm trying to understand that actual relationship. One is the Fed say, okay, bond market is doing. It's hard. It's hard to say, but you can just think of it in terms of, you know, like, you know, two points make a difference. But, but I, it's very hard to think about the bond market and the stock market in a macro sense. And it's very hard to put like tied hard numbers. I mean, the CME has a Fed watch tool, which is really effective. And it's pretty much spot on, you know, from an odds perspective. But the way to think of bonds is every two points higher or lower, put different cuts back on the table. But that's it. Got it. Okay.

Are they generally responsive? Because one of the reasons why ask all this is because they have no choice. That is their job. They, they, they, the, the bonds drive the Fed. There is no nothing else to it. Got it. Yeah, the reason why ask is because this recent rate environments really interesting to me, because I've been hearing a lot of like macro people talking about, you know, the Fed's late, the Fed's late, the Fed should have caught already the Fed, you know, the Fed should do this Fed bonds are saying this. I'm just continually trying to contextualize that stuff. But I mean, I always find that's the tricky part about macro is it's kind of. Yeah. Well, the Fed also has a more challenging election year because they have to act like, you know, they have to play the role of, you know, Switzerland. They have to be independent. And they, the integrity of the Fed depends on is really dependent on their on their independent, you know, on how objective they can be objectively independent. So it's important that the Fed maintains that level of integrity. And so I, I don't think in a perfect world. I don't think they're going to do anything that's outside of bond prices. I",

And thank you for the context. I know some of that stuff might sound elementary to you. But I think a lot of people they hear that statement of, you know, bonds lead the Fed, but it's sometimes difficult to connect those when you're looking at a bond straight in real time. And so anytime you have a real time market that's, you know, that's a few hundred billion dollars deep. You can't, there's no other way to think about it. Like I mean, do you want the real prices or do you want like somebody's, you know, somebody's spitballing and telling you what the Fed should do. No, you just look at the bond prices that your whole markets there. Got it. Yeah. When you look out over the rest of the year and you see the SP 500, you know, in the first half of the years up, almost 20. Yeah.

There is with pairstrains and because the spreads kind of expanded contract and there is with volatility, but now with price. Got it. Somebody had a question for you. They heard that you had played poker with Michael Jordan. Yeah. What was that like? What was it like? Yep. Well, it's again that lasted for 18 years. No, like maybe 16 years. So need some context. Context. When. When the bulls drafted Jordan in 1984, the bulls stunk. They were the worst team in the NBA or among the worst teams. And nobody went to bulls games. Like 3000 people, 4000 people.

I was only like three years older than Michael or something. And four years older than Michael. And so. So they knocked up. They just happen to get off the elevator like the bulls ticket team.

He's another after two games were like, he's another freaking level. Like he is. We've never seen like it. So.

So we play this huge game of poker and guts and all this crazy stuff. And we wiped him out in like an hour and he lost all five grand. Now he's pissed because he's really competitive. I was going to ask about that. How much money that you know, he's like, he's like, he's on his crappy rookie contract or something. So he's making like, well, he had a McDonald's deal. He had some deals, but he's sold Jordan. So we don't want to get a money. You know, we're like, you're good. We know where you live. He goes, I wouldn't borrow money from you, mother fuckers.

And the Vegas trip, I know can't go too deep because it's Vegas. But what do you guys do there? Just go gamble a bunch. Yeah. They were playing a preseason game and in a preseason game in Vegas. And we happened to be in Vegas the same weekend. So we went to the Mirage and we played. We played back rack all night long on the private like area, but it was fenced off and it was really fun. Rodman was there. I think Rodman was there and maybe somebody else, but it was crazy night. And I think we all got killed, but whatever. Who cares? Yeah. God asked about Rodman though, because everything I've heard about like the interviews I've seen about him and stuff is that he apparently is a bit of a party animal. Yeah. I don't really know. I've heard stories, but and I know some people that know him. I, I never, I've only met him. I didn't know him at all. He was a little bit of a loner,",

Yes, but nothing like that. What's the next one? Oh, you mean our games? Like the next one in that list. So you have playing poker with Michael Jordan at 12 to 0 4 before you go to work.

Well, we're not, you know, when we say we played poker, it was a lot of stupid games that were played like, you know, we logged a lot of gin too, like a lot, a lot, a lot of gin.

And they were really good cards, but they, but they punched them. So they had like a hole in them because they were used. But they would sell them to us for I want to say a dollar, maybe a little bit less. And they would, but we had a minimum of 1500. We had to buy and we went through about 1500 decks of cards a month. Oh, shit. So that's what it was like. Oh my god. Yeah. And that's a bad for a long time. That's super intense. So then after the cards, what took place?

Like if you're talking to a brand new trader that's saying, I want a trade. What's the direction you send them down? I don't know that I'm not sure what they're trying to solve for.

For others, they've reached a point where they want to learn how to manage their through trading, they can learn, you can learn more faster through trading than you can any other way.

So I think there's different reasons why different people choose to be traders or choose to trade. For some people, it's a compliment too for other people, it's a time suck, which is all good. I mean, there's a lot of, when you think about your life, people have the ability to waste an enormous amount of time just between watching Netflix and you can go down a Netflix rabbit hole, you can go down an Amazon rabbit hole, a YouTube rabbit hole, you can go down easily down a TikTok rabbit hole.

And so that's, you know, throughout the years, most of the successful entrepreneurs that I've run into are incredibly fast decision makers. They don't listen very well, but they make really good decisions. I, people that listen drive me crazy because, because listeners are not traders. The traders, like, and they'll tell you six different people are telling six different stories simultaneously. And somehow you're picking up all bits and pieces of each story. So I, I'm not a really big fan of listeners. You know, I like people that don't listen. I could see why though, because listening in that context is really passive. So, I should make a t-shirt that says that. I like people that don't listen. I love that. Yeah. It's very on brand too. So then if you think about new traders then in this context of being able to make quick decisions, but there's a bit of a paradox here, right? Because most new traders limited capital.

You go, that's why we preach the whole trade small trade often because you have to create enough occurrences in order to learn and you have to create enough occurrences in order to create a predictable outcome. It's the whole law of large numbers. It's absolutely in play in the trading world. But the other side to it is that people are emotional. People are egotistical. People are, you know, stubborn. People are very undisciplined. People like to think that they have, embedded inside everybody is this crazy gambler's policy, which is really hard to get around if you've never traded. So, because you don't have enough places in your life where you could experience that kind of decision making or the need for that kind of decision making.

So, it's the success rate's higher, but it's not high enough. Yeah. So, if you're talking to a new trader, what tips do you give them to drive that success up? Trade small trade off and one of them, obviously, beyond that. Yeah, the whole concept of trade small trade off is great. The two that I really think are important. And again, I can't emphasize enough the trading small piece because that was the hardest hurdle for us to get over. The next two would be stay in the most liquid underlines there are. Like, just make sure, liquidity is your friend. So, make sure you stay in liquid underlines. And then I really believe strongly, like it's over the top on this that you have to manage stuff early. You cannot let stuff go to where the end of a cycle can wipe out a single trade. You have to manage trades early. You reduce risk. You reduce the volatility, your own volatility, and you reduce your risk so dramatically. You essentially eliminate your outlier risk. And the one thing that kills people is outlier risk.

Now, something I saw somebody mention in a comment somewhere on this exact thread where the idea of managing early, they are curious. And I thought it was a good idea. I obviously have a bunch of thoughts on it, but I want to hear yours, which are if the general thesis 45 days manage about 21. Once we get within 21, a lot of these other things come out of the woodwork. Their question was, well, then why isn't it at 21? Why don't you just inverse take the other side? It's a fair question. But that's what I thought. But it's an easy answer. Exactly. It's not because the odds change at 21 days. It has nothing to do with that. It's the magnitude of the change in the decay curve where you end up taking so much more risk. So what that means is the reason you don't flip the cards over is if you put a trade on it 45 days and you let it go, let's just say as an example, and you let it go to expiration. And let's say your chance of success is 65. Then in the end, if you do enough time, it's going to be 65. If you",

Then in the end, if you do enough time, it's going to be 65. If you put the same trade on it 45 days and you take it off at 21 days, your probability of success is still going to be 65. So there's no difference. You're 65. If you take it off at 21 days and you're 65 in the end, if you hold it all the way to the end, the difference is that the dollars you make per day between 45 and 21 are about 35 more per day, your P and L per day, than if you hold it from 45 to zero. So the reason you take it off is not to flip the cards over. It's because the amount of money you make on a dollars per day for taking the same amount of risk is significantly greater. And that's why it is the optimal point in the decay curve. Got it. And you mentioned an important part there of risk adjusted basis, correct?

It feels like you're wasting time. So then you try to do a bunch of stuff super fast to try to get caught up and it tends to be very spastic. So that can be tough to control. So that's the origin of the question. So the question is, as a new trader, what are the things you want to focus on? And for how long? That's the second part's important. Can you say how long should it take? Not necessarily how long it should take, but how long they could expect to spend truly focusing on this thing before they feel really familiar with it.

It was almost impossible to ramp anybody up in a short period of time, one to two years minimum. Nowadays it's very different because the playing feels level, the technology's great, the fees are commoditized. The markets are incredibly liquid. You know, there's a penny wide markets for everything. I would say that the fascinating thing today is that you can essentially, if you are able to stay small enough and make enough small trades, you can ramp up in, you know, 30 to 60 days. And you can be very confident in your understanding of what's going on. Doesn't mean you making money. But I think you need to go through one full 45 day cycle.

If you're just buying stocks, okay, great. If you're buying stock selling calls against it, or you know, selling stock selling puts or doing something, you know, shorting puts to get long stock, you know, all that stuff's way more, you know, takes a little bit longer and then when you get into options, strategies, it takes a little bit longer.

It depends on, you know, on a, it depends on the amount of capital. I mean, if it's somebody with a reasonable amount of capital and they're comfortable with covered calls or cash secured boots or short puts, I mean, that's where I would start because I like the high probability of success in my, in those cases, you know, a short out of the money put has, you know, up to an 80 probability profit. I like that covered call, maybe 65 to 67 probability profit. I like that. If you want to do a vertical spread, that would be for the people that have less capital, you know, risk to find credit spread or debit spread, lower probability of profit. Maybe it's 50, 50, maybe it's, you know, 60, 40, but a good way to get your feet wet, you know, just depends on your capital, you know, the amount of capital you have. Unfortunately, the trading world capital does matter. Of course. And what would you say minimum starting capital versus optimal starting capital? Optimal starting capital would be 25,000 plus. I mean, optimal would be 100, but, you",

But any amount like if you're 21 years old and you're starting with, you know, 2,000, you need 2,000 because that's the minimum for have a margin account to allow you to do complex spreads. But even if you have 2,000, that's totally great to get started with. I mean, most people that have 2,000 to trade with also have 2,000 to go to Vegas with and your chances of learning a lot more through trading than going to Vegas is about is about, you know, 10X. So yeah, I'm pretty confident that with 2,000, you might not make money, but you're going to learn a crap load and you're going to be infinitely better off as in every aspect of your life. So it sounds like in I love that you make that distinction. It sounds like what you're messaging there is if you're starting with a really small amount of money, 2,000 in this case, focus on what you're learning, not necessarily turning this 2000 into 2,000.",

Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, people have this crazy, you know, you have this, this idea that, you know, somewhere, someplace, one time somebody turned 2,000 into 100,000 into a million into 10 million, whatever. Okay, that's, you know, somebody also bought a lottery ticket for 5, you know, what a hand put 10 lottery tickets for 5 or five lottery tickets for 5 and ended up winning, you know, a couple hundred million. Yeah, sure, it's happened. But that's not. Next to Jordan courtside that too. Yeah, whatever. Right. Well, that was more calculated. We call that strategic. But the reality is that, that, you know, what you'd like to do with 2,000 is, you know, ideally is to turn it into 3,000. And in the same time, learn everything there is to know. So that when you start to acquire wealth, you have all the optionality in your fingertips. Right.

Because I think most people that start with a small amount of money, their expectation is they're going to turn it into a large amount of money. So",

It's really cool. Thanks for sharing a lot of other stories. It's really fun hearing more about the stuff you've done. That's very cool. Most of us won't have that experience. So thank you for sharing with us. Thank you for hanging out. I'll obviously throw a link to all of your guys' stuff in the description below so you can come check out Tastyworks and all that stuff.
