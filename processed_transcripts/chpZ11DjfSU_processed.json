    "text": "What is up, the ape community, it is Eric and yet again, I come and piece them here to talk about options. I'm actually following up on a prior video that I did and actually kind of a mini series that I'm starting to do about trading options in something like GameStop, although if you're not trading GameStop, what I'm covering today is applicable to you anyways, because what I'm going to talk about is adjusting in the money short calls, which ideally that's what we want to happen. If we're selling calls as part of a ratio covered call, which is what we reviewed in the last video, I'll throw a link to that in the description in case you haven't seen that. The whole point of this strategy is we're going to hold shares of an equity in this example GameStop and we want to hold the equity anyways. That's the premise. And then we are holding something longer term, whatever you're holding duration is part of your plan. But there are going to be periods where a stock might be a little more mellow and we can see periods like that in this timeframe, right? So we can see GameStop from really the middle slash end of the summer until the 11th of November has been pretty range bound. So if you're holding equity during that duration, it's not really doing a whole lot, but you can sell some calls against some of your shares in order",

So if you're holding equity during that duration, it's not really doing a whole lot, but you can sell some calls against some of your shares in order to collect some premium upfront. However, as with anything in trading, there's always a catch. The catch in this instance is sooner or later, the thing that you're selling calls in can start to move and it can start to move pretty fast. That can create a problem, especially if you're actually not wanting to unwind your shares, which that's why we do it at a ratio. So the prior video walks through the basis of this ratio covered call and how it strikes a bounce between taking in some premium upfront, but preserving upside, especially in case things start to get out of handings moving really, really fast because it can happen. You can get caught. However, especially in something like GameStop, which is very picky, there are a lot of chances for you to adjust your trade so that you can keep your shares, but still will be able to sell some short calls to collect something. And we actually went through an example during a prior live stream and I captured data from that that I'm going to review now.

And then as always, if you have questions as we go through this, please let me know. That's the whole point of this. So if you'll recall, we used the example of this date here, the 16th of April. Why did we do that? Because I wanted to pick as disadvantage point is humanly possible to start selling calls. Why is this so disadvantage because the stock is at a low? So that means everything passed this point in hindsight. The stock has been higher. So we're selling short calls into what we now know in the future to be a very difficult time because it's just straight up, especially into this short squeeze that we had. So I thought this would provide a great example of how you can manage short calls in a very challenging environment because managing a short call in this kind of environment, super easy. It's been a slow gradual move up. It's had some down ticks. This is easy days to manage a short call. This is challenging. And the reason why this is so challenging is because when we get in,",

This is challenging. And the reason why this is so challenging is because when we get in, the price of GameStop for the example was in like the 10 handle. And then it's not seen that again. It's essentially never been not double that. So we're literally dealing with something where when we entered and started selling calls against it, it is doubled in price and not come back, which provides a really, really great example for us to work through. So this is the original video that I did about trading options in GameStop. And this one obviously introduces the ratio covered call. And then the video that we're in now is going to talk about the management. I realize that I don't have the same exact shirt on, but it's pretty damn close. I also realize that my forehead is disgustingly shiny. That's a little nerve wracking, but that stuff aside, this is what we captured. So I don't expect you to know what this is right out of the gate. This is a very, very basic log that I built for us to go through the example together.

So you can test it out for yourself. That's the point. Now the entire premise of a ratio covered call is that you want to hold more than 100 shares. You have to be able to create a ratio. Why does it have to be that? Because of this, I will show you what I'm going to draw for you because it's a little easier. So if we have 100 shares, our PNL graph will look like this with this. Well, let's see if I can get at least a little greater than that. Something like that. This is the zero line. Now when you have anything over, well, first let me just reset and do what if we sell a call against this? So if you have 100 shares and then you sell one call, your PNL graph is now going to turn into this. And you see that it levels off. Just pretend that these lines are level. And that means that you now have capped profit potential, anything above the strike of this call. So what this can turn into though is provided that you have greater than 100 shares. Literally even 101 will do it. Anything greater than 100 shares, it turns it into this where it still will maintain an",

Literally even 101 will do it. Anything greater than 100 shares, it turns it into this where it still will maintain an upside profit potential because this one share is now not covered. You have 100 shares that are covered by this one short call because remember each short call represents up to negative 100 shares. So these two cancel out. That leaves you are one share alone and unafraid out there to build profit for you. So the name of the game there is to determine how many shares you want, how many short calls you want. And the prior video goes through all of that. In this video, I want to specifically talk about the management of the short calls because that's a tricky part of this game. So if we think about selling short calls, we first need to start with identifying the risks, specifically in the context of selling short calls in something that we do not want to take assignment and meaning what we don't want to be assigned. We kind of are forced on the cell side. We don't want to be assigned, meaning we want to keep our shares. That's the first context. So what are our risks?

Well, if the stock goes above our strike price and we're in here, this technically is a risk, this zone. Why is this, why is this a risk? It's an opportunity cost because if we have a stock that we're holding the downside risk for and it eventually makes a massive up move and we can't participate, that means that we've taken all of this risk and we've not got the commensurate payoff for this risk. So that can be part of your strategy, can be accepted, it can be fine. It's just a consideration that is an absolute opportunity cost I consider that a risk to the strategy. The second risk in the context of you not wanting to let go of your shares is early assignment. This is one we're going to have to pay attention to, especially on something that tends to have really big moves. Now, when are we at risk of early assignment? There's two primary periods. The first one is when extrinsic value is about zero and this really becomes more pertinent I would consider when it's less than a dime, 0.10. And even that's a little high, that's kind of like an early warning system when it's like sub-a-nickel is when I would consider to be moderately accessible, but even",

And we'll talk about why early assignment is not necessarily the biggest risk if it's managed, but we have to manage it. Now the second period is if we have a dividend coming up and the dividend yield is greater than the extrinsic value. So let's talk about these two scenarios really fast because if you're new to options, this might make no sense to you and that's okay. We will literally be able to describe all of it very, very simply. And what I want to do is actually go over to the platform and use some live examples because I think this might be a little easier if you can look at a live example with me. So let's take a look at GameStop. Let's go to 13Ds and let's take a look at these options. And if you'll recall, every single option has two forms of its value. That's what creates the premium of an option. We have intrinsic and extrinsic value. Intrinsic value is simply how far in the money something is. Extrinsic value is a composition of time value, how much days, how many days are left, the expiration and",

So if we have an option and let's say we look at this 25 strike, just had a curiosity. And we say the 25 strike right now and we'll take a couple notes so that actually I can just do it right in here so we can look at it real together. So we take a look at this 25 strike right here and let's say that we're short the 25 call that is not pretty far in the money by like 4.50. That's the current premium. Spot price right now is, well, let's just call Spot price 29. And we have a strike price of 25. So that means we have 4 of intrinsic value. And the reason why I know it's 4 of intrinsic values because our strike price is 25. The underlying is currently trading at 29. So the difference between those because this is a call and we're in the money, intrinsic value. Then for the extrinsic value, I just showed you that the option here is trading at a premium of 4.50. So if we have 4.50, less our intrinsic value gives us 0.50. So this is how much extrinsic value is",

They're not actually at massive risk of early assignment right now. Why is that the case? Well, first one, as you'll recall, there's not even a dividend here, right? We know that there's no dividend in game stop right now. So that's not a scenario we have to concern ourselves with. Now why not just early assignment because whoever's holding these options, if they exercise, well, that means that they can get the, they can buy the stock at 25. That's pretty awesome because otherwise if they bought it on the market, it'd be at 29. Why wouldn't they do that? It's because they throw this away. So let's take a look at the actual transactions as that would, as would occur. So we have the option buyer, the other side of your trade. So they bought to open and they bought to open, let's just use current price at 4.50 or whatever. So they bought to open one at 4.50. So they paid a 450 debit.

Now they're like, yo, I want to exercise. Cool. So then they hit the broker up and they say exercise my options. So what's going to happen here is they're going to buy to open 100 shares at their strike price of 25. So then this is going to cost them their 25 per times 100. Oops, that's most of the rest of the, this is in the wrong spot. Ignore that. This is what they're going to pay out of pocket. And when they do this, this goes away. This vanishes. So right now they would have an unrealized profit of the difference between these two things, which again is 400. It's the intrinsic value. So what happened in this scenario is they just lost 50 bucks. The reason why they lost 50 bucks is when they exercise, they get to buy it at 25. They're going to pay 2,500. The stock is currently at 29 and unrealized gain of 400 bucks. You capture the intrinsic value. That's great. But the extrinsic value is just gone. You give that up.

If they sell the option to close, they literally make 50 more dollars. It's otherwise the same thing. So this is exactly why early exercise in general just doesn't make sense because you're just giving up extrinsic value. The reason why all this detail matters is because you have to understand the counter-party to your trade. What they're thinking, what they might be doing, what your risk might be because you if you remember, this is about managing in the money short calls. So as soon as your short call falls in the money, it's not immediately at risk of early assignment. And in the case of a dividend for those wondering, the time that it makes sense is if the dividend is greater than this extrinsic value. So if there's a stock that pays a dollar per share, you would be better off exercising your option in this scenario. And then you rate the dividend provided that it's by X-DivD, which gives you an extra 100. Excuse me, I have 100 shares. So yes, you throw this 50 away, but then you net 50 extra.

So yes, you throw this 50 away, but then you net 50 extra. So you cover that 50 loss with this 100. And then you make another 50 on top of it. It makes you whole and you make a little bit more money. So the time that this becomes at risk for early assignment with respect to something that is a dividend is if the dividend value is greater than your extrinsic value because then it makes sense for the holder to take the dividend. So if you made nothing else is factored into the equation, maybe they don't have the money to take the inventory. Maybe they don't want to deal with them drop after the dividend. There's a million other things, but this is the theoretical backdrop for it. So now you should be able to answer the question of when are we at risk of early assignment and where at risk of early assignment, if there's very, very little extrinsic value left, meaning the person doesn't mind throwing it away, or if there's a dividend coming up that's greater than the current extrinsic value of your short call. So now we have those two scenarios. Great. Now we can talk about managing in the money short calls. The reason why this matters so much, especially in",

    "text": "mind throwing it away, or if there's a dividend coming up that's greater than the current extrinsic value of your short call. So now we have those two scenarios. Great. Now we can talk about managing in the money short calls. The reason why this matters so much, especially in something that moves a lot is you have to know when you're at risk of losing your shares if you're trying to keep them. Now one giant caveat has to be made here. This is why I use a ratio because you still could be assigned. You can exercise even if it doesn't financially make sense. It is their right to exercise whenever they want. So you have to be prepared even in that highly unlikely scenario and it's highly unlikely it still could happen. So what I would tell somebody is if you have long shares and you just don't want to let them go, don't sell calls against them. Just don't do it because there is a risk. Even if we do all these things to mitigate it, there is a risk structurally. It's very, very small, but it's there. So if you're in the camp, don't want to let the shares go, the same for you. If you're in the camp like the scenario that we're talking about and we use the scenario of gaining entry on 16 April when the stock was around 10 and a half and this person bought a thousand shares.

If you're in the camp like the scenario that we're talking about and we use the scenario of gaining entry on 16 April when the stock was around 10 and a half and this person bought a thousand shares. This is a hypothetical scenario. This was our entry trade. So in this case, we started on the 16th of April with this position. We sold four of the 17 May 12 strikes and we collected 45 cents. This was the starting scenario that we begun with. This stock at this point was trading like 10 30. It's just because we were using on demand. That's why these aren't the exact same. So what happened after this first transaction on the 23rd of April, we ended up taking this down for 21 cents and we made a profit of 96. So what we did at this point was buy a handful of more shares and really you could argue that we should have done nine shares, I think. Yeah, nine shares is in the to make all the numbers work out. So on the 23rd of April, when we exited this position and we made 96 bucks on the same day, technically it could have been the same day towards the end of the day or it could have been the following day on the open. But we bought nine shares essentially taking the PL, the realized PL from that trade. And",

So now our total position is a thousand nine shares. This is our total cost 10,5001 and then we have our total composite basis, which again is just right around 1050. So this was I just picked a spot to start. This obviously wasn't a challenged position. This thing had no issues whatsoever. This was in this time frame in here. But the next trade is where things get spicy. So on the 23rd of April and we can go back to that day and on demand, it'll take a second for it to load. But let's go back to the 23rd of April here and I'll let that start to load while we're there. That's where we took this down and that's where we opened up our next trade.

I don't think anybody knew it, especially at this point, there was no sign in the options markets that anything squirrelly was going on. None of that was there.

It's because if you remember in the last video, we try to strike a balance with the duration, how much money we're making, how much time the trade has to work and whatnot. I purposely use the 59 days to expiration to actually hamper myself. This makes this scenario more challenging. Why doesn't make it more challenging? Well, it makes it more challenging because there's so much time left in these options. You actually run out of what I call expiration liquidity. So you notice here that there's an expiration in three days, then in 10 days. So there's a seven day difference here, then a seven day difference here, then a seven day difference here. But then notice as you go further out here, it expands. It's much greater than a seven day difference between these two and then between these two. So as we get further out in time, there's less expiration just because there's less liquidity, there's not as many people trading that far out.

Now another admin note when it comes to managing short calls, one of the best things or managing any short option by the way, one of the best times to roll is when the strike price equals the stock price when they're the same. Why is that the case? Well, it's because if we take a look, let's go to the 17 DTE for the example. If we take a look at stock price equals strike price, meaning the at the money. Let's just call it the 11s. These 11s, let's say that you sold the 11 calls back when it was nine. So these were out of the money and then they come at the money. This is showing you that directly you're wrong. The stock is moving. Now whether it sustains the move, we don't know. But when an option is at the money, it is the point where it has the most X-transic value. So there's a part of natural traders that I don't want to buy that back. If I sold it, that doesn't make sense. However, as an option goes further and further in the money, it gains more and more intrinsic value and it has less and less X-transic value.

However, as an option goes further and further in the money, it gains more and more intrinsic value and it has less and less X-transic value. So when you buy back a really deep in the money option, you're buying back a ton of intrinsic value that does not decay. It's intrinsic. So that means you have to go really far out in time in order to compensate via X-transic value, all of that intrinsic value that you have to buy back. So we'll take a look at a couple examples of that to help the point settle in. Feel free to listen to that one or two times through if that sounds super weird. But it has everything to do with the constitution of the price of the premium and how we can manage it. So again, if you don't need all those details suffice it to say, you will have the most amount of choices as you're being challenged to roll your option when the strike price is equivalent to the stock price, give or take doesn't be exactly, but close enough. That's when extrinsic value is the highest. That's what ultimately will decay out of your option. So if we take a look, let's say we had these six calls, there's like no extrinsic value left.

Well, if I roll out to the seven junes and I look at the sixes, can I get 5.12? Maybe the bid as spread is so wide because it's so far in the money unless I can hit it at the midpoint, I might not be able to. That's because it's so far in the money I'm buying back so much intrinsic value that my choices are truly limited and notice how I can't get any basis improvement. There's no way that I'll be able to get these six and a halfs again because of liquidity. I need to get at least 5.12 if I get filled there. The probability of me getting 5.15 on these and moving up half a point is very low. Definitely can't get a point improvement because these are for 4.70. Now let's take a look at another scenario.

We can move from an 11 strike to a 13 strike. I can move two points away in the same time frame as compared to the other scenario that I would be lucky to move 50 cents. So that's how that relationship works. And it's a delicate balance between expiration, liquidity, meaning if you go too far out in time and then the move just keeps happening, you just have to sit there and deal with it because you can't keep rolling out forever. You're literally going to run out of expiration cycles to pick from. So that's the balance act here. So going back to this, we sell these and let's now fast forward and get some time under our belts. Let's go to the 7 May expiration. Ah, starts rallying here. Now, in reality, if this were my actual trade, I absolutely would roll it in one of these three days. There's no doubt in my mind.

We're not going to because I'm again, trying to use a really difficult scenario for the example. So I'm not giving myself the easier out that I would take. I'm just letting you know that there's no way that I would let it run through those three days and not do something with it. So let's see what these 21 June 14s are trading for right now. So the 21 June are still 45 days out. And these 14s are now a dollar and a half in the money. There's a lot of extrinsic value left. We could take these in for 3.90. The only choice you have is rolling it out 73 days. So if we go out here and we see where can we get 3.90, you can get it to the 15s. And this is the problem with waiting too long.

So you might not even be able to get your basis adjustment if you're taking those in for 3.90 to get your role for a net credit. Now you don't always have to get a net credit to have a total positive role scenario. So what does that mean? Let's use a little bit of scratch paper over here. So on this trade, we made 96. So let's throw in 96. And then here we had 54 cents. So let's drop 54 cents here. And then we had what? A for a lot. So in this case, we took in a credit of 2.16 times 100 to 16.

So let's take a look at this times 100. I'm just doing all the math out for you this times 100. So what happens here? You'll notice that even though from 3.90, what we closed at, to selling to open the new ones at 3.87, which is a 3. debit technically between these, you still actually have collected enough once you include the prior credit you received here. And then the prior PNL of the original call. Now you don't have to include this because we put this in stock technically.",

But I just want to make sure when people say like you always have to roll for a net credit, you don't actually have to. You just have to track your math really well. And in this case, you would be fine in this hypothetical scenario. But let us continue beyond this because for the sake of the scenario, we did not do that. We literally waited until the last moment that we could, which would have been on the 13th of May. The reason why the 13th of May was the last moment you'll see. Big giant move. Big giant move. Now if we take a look at our 21 June's and we have the 14's, let's take a look at these 14's, you'll notice a really important detail now. We are running really, really fast out of extrinsic value, really fast. These have gone so far in the money, they're at an 86 delta. They're essentially 15 in the money. So right now there's maybe a dollar and change left of extrinsic value. So you don't have to, you know that you don't have to take these down yet. There's enough value in them to",

But I think what we did in the scenario on the other live stream is we actually looked at it early in the morning, because early in the morning, it was even higher. Not yet. So maybe we have to go to like 730. Let's try that. Just eyeball on the price here. Yeah, something like this. I think we're close to, we're going to exactly what time it hit that. It's obviously sometime between 730 and 630. But what I did for the example is I made it so that we're like this right here. We're very close to the very top. So right now the spot price is not 29. It'll be like 36. So these will be even worse once this buffers, which we'll see in a second. And this is why you have to pay attention to the amount of extrinsic value. And then the risk of early assignment, because the other scenario that's going on here is people are going to be clamoring to get shares if they think that this is another full on short squeeze, because that can be catastrophic as we know.

So in this scenario, you can see that it hit a peak of like 2305 of in just overall cost and of that it's 21 in the money. So there's still extrinsic value, but a lot, it's just, it's buried right now. So that's why in the scenario, we actually waited a little bit. We waited as the stock came down to 2593. It was a random spot that we picked and we closed it for 15.45. This represents a 5,964 loss big loss. What I try to tell people is when you're trading this kind of strategy, you have to have patience, because that's the way that this works in the long run. We're taking losses upfront, we're realizing losses upfront. But as long as we are capable of continuing to roll and adjust the trade and or eventually, letting the shares get called away, then we can ultimately make money. How does that process work?

And it's a great point. So let's say that gamestop actually maintained this meteoric rise and you were in the very, very rare but possible scenario that you just couldn't roll. So let's pretend all of this isn't here. And let's say that you originally sold this for 0.54 and let's say that in order to close this here, let's say that this was like 30. So this would have been a massive amount of money in order for you to close. So instead of 15, it's double that. So instead of it costing 6,000 debit, it's like a 13,000, what the rest of the change added in. So like a 13,000 debit, something like that, just a massive amount of money to close. And let's just say that the stock kept going up. And there was no point to roll. Well, that's when you have to be prepared to part with the shares. And that's why we do it at a lower amount.

And more importantly, you always have that exit window of just let it just let it get assigned, just let it be done. Because let's use one other scenario. Let's say you completed that first role. And then you were like, okay, this, this isn't working anymore. Let's say we're in this scenario now. And what I'm trying to show you is that you always have that exit.

As I showed you in that other example, trying to roll the sixes. Once they fall so far in the money and there's so little extrinsic value, it's very difficult to get anything back out of these without adding a little bit more risk. Now what's the drawback? The drawback is now instead of having 200 shares, you have 200 more shares covered here. You go from four to six. So you have to be prepared to run this all the way through either through management or acknowledging at some point that the jig is up and you're going to have to let now this new number of shares go. If you're uncomfortable with that, you either take the exit here or you just try to roll out and not improve your basis or you go out further in time. Like there's other choices available to you. This is a slightly more aggressive approach, but it's designed to get us out of trouble faster. You have to have the stomach for it. That's all there is to it.

So this is a massive win to be able to make this kind of adjustment. But all that aside, let's say after that adjustment, let's just pretend that this scenario didn't happen where we exited. And let's say that the stock just kept flying up. It was just absolutely skyrocketing up. Well, here's what happens. If that occurs and let's say that you had this six out, so you would have your 600 shares that you have for 10.5, you would sell to close 600 of those and you would do it at 15. And then you would keep the entire premium. So in this case, you would keep the credit of 69.90. So if you look at the 69.90 credit that you got, plus the prior loss of 59.64 plus the prior win of 96, you notice that you still come out ahead. You still made money.

You might be upset about it because you're like, well, shit, I'm selling them at 15.1 right now. They're trading at 60. That does suck. But again, you still have another 400 shares that you got at 10.5 that are now trading at 60. That's pretty cool. But if you take a look at the rest of this example, we are actually able to maneuver through it. So to fast forward through the rest of this, what we ended up doing was just clawing our way back slowly. So you can see we had the 15 strike out in 19 July. We had six of those. We got those sold for 11.65. And again, you'll notice that this is not a total credit here because we closed these at 15.45, but we sold these for 11.65. How does this make sense? It's because we sold more of them. So if you take a look at the total credit net credit here in this case, the way that I kind of tracked a math, this is taking the total PNL of 59.64. As long as I take in more than 59.64 on this next trade, I'm good. That's all I need. So in this",

So in this case, because I'm selling more that allows me to have a credit even though it's a lower premium and even though I'm able to move the basis by a dollar that overwhelms the prior PNL, realized PNL. So we continue this process from 16 April, or 16 April, 23 April, 13 May 19 June, or July 23 July, five, aug, 30, and then 11 November is when we're finally able to exit. This is when we're essentially in total profit. Like we've made money, we're at no risk anymore. We're good to just continue the process as per usual. So essentially from this point on in 23 July is when we were able to get this flattened out so that we were down 15 bucks flat and then we're able to just run standard programming from there. We can either maintain the size if we want. We can scale the size down like we did here so that we don't have as many shares covered, but you'll notice that I strategically use increasing the share sizes to give me bigger basis adjustments.

Sometimes people don't understand like let's say we're in this scenario here. Let's say we just realized the loss of 5,964 bucks and we came in here and we sold six of the 19 July 15s for 11 65. This up here tells me what I need this premium to be trading at in order to hit a break even. That's what this tells me. So for example, we have the 11 65s. I just pull the data out of here. We pull the 11 65s times the six lot. We weigh that against the realized PNL leading into it and this is using the total PNL. We can use whatever PNL that we want. This tells me that I need these 11 65s for the 15 strike 19 Julys that I sold for 11 65. I need those to be trading at 1.87 in order for this to be a break even trade and I'll show you exactly what it looks like just so that it's clear. I know that might sound weird.

We can just say that we want to use this the 59 64. So let's do that minus 59 64 and we're doing that because we're saying well, we put this into more shares. So this isn't even there. So 59 64 in this case, we have that role that we talked about six of these 15 19 Julys. We sold them for 11 65. We need them to be trading at 1.71 in order for these two trades essentially to cancel out. So let's try that. So let's type in 1.71. So let's pretend that's where we closed and voila. Notice how the sum is now zero. So if you're curious how to calculate this, all I'm doing is taking the relationship. Well, let me see if I get this out of the way. Taking the relationship between the realized PNL of whatever I'm trying to overcome. And I'm taking that against the lot size and the premium for an adjusted net credit for the other trade.

I'm taking the lot size times the premium for the role trade that gives me again, what I call an adjusted net credit. I'm adding that to the loss from the prior trade divided by 100 kind of puts it in a per lot basis or in a standard options contract basis. And then I divide the whole thing by the number of lots so that I know exactly what I need each single contract to be trading at. Because again, when you look at an options chain, it's not going to show the options chain in the context of you having six lots. It's going to show it in one lot instances. So that's what that does. So I know that's a lot, but I hope it's helpful. As always, we can go further into detail on this. We can talk some other techniques if you'd like, or we can move on to the next strategy.
