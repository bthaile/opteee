I fixed an irrigation leak in the backyard and I was flagged by that I couldn't figure out and I finally found the leak and got to it and repaired the header and everything's working beautifully now. So I love that. Happy day. I find a big part of home ownership is irrigation maintenance because I literally I literally have two little like hand carts one upstairs, one downstairs, literally for fixing irrigation, which I do all the time. So it sounds like it's a mutual experience because I forgot you're up in the mountains. So I am now. Yeah, I got two houses. We go down to the valley. In the Scottsdale area north Scottsdale for the winter usually, but I'm going down this afternoon because I'm meeting up with some family are coming in from the airport. So I get to go out to dinner with everyone tonight. That's so awesome. I'm stoked. Well, you're looking you're looking great. You're probably healthier than I am right now. So I got a pernated disk. So your boy is. I had a bulging disk that blew good when I was see what I would have been about 50 years old. It finally ruptured and oh my gosh, bad pain. Yeah, and I got a good one. Fortunately, I got",

Yeah, and I got a good one. Fortunately, I got one of those fancy shots with the very long needles and surprisingly 15 minutes later after the shot, I walked out completely normal and I haven't had any problem since. Maybe I need to find that shot because mine's been going on for like two weeks and it's not been super fun. So I'll I'll have to look into it. But enough about my broken back. Let's talk about some some markets. So I figured a good place to start actually is with the recent sell off that we had. What do you make of that? We saw it kind of across the indices and yeah, what are your thoughts there? Yeah, I just think it's we had a long time of a lot of up move, a lot of concentration of the money into things like NVIDIA. And I think what ended up happening is everybody was sitting there, you know, having made some nice money and getting a little itchy to take those profits. And I think when the thing started falling in for any excuse, it was like a match on a bunch of gasoline. You know, all of a sudden you had a firestorm. And then",

And then now the last week or so it's been trying to climb its way back out of the hole, but. Boy today was one of the quietest days I've ever seen. I gave up and went and fixed irrigation. It was a lot more interesting. And I tied down some netting in the vegetable garden and did some pruning and had a nice day outside took a shower put on the uniform for the inner. And yeah, it's been a nice relaxing day, but there was no point for me to be at my desk for sure. Yeah, one of the things that I thought was interesting to your point, I felt very similar with the sell off. It felt like we had a very just one sided move. It's hard to classify like what over done is, but it just seemed like we're going up. And to me, when the market does that for long enough to your point, I always get the sense that you kind of never know what's going to tilt it, but something typically does.

What I thought was interesting though was the series of gap downs into kind of that really strong support day on the fifth where I mean, I had a pretty nasty previous two days. So when you see the market take a bite on a day like the fifth, what do you make of that? Do you think that's kind of just where the market is deciding this is a value area? I like it here. Sell off enough for what do you think? Well, what I think actually is a supply and demand of orders with a lot of computer power behind it means things are going to move very fast and a lot of people are going to adjust their positions very, very quickly. And because of the speed they can do that, I don't know that the support area to me, at least, would be magical at all. I think I think it's just that everybody that wanted to take a profit or sell or get nervous or do whatever they want to do had done it. So the selling kind of subsides a little bit and then everybody starts looking at everybody and deciding, do I want to be the hero that steps in and starts making it go up again.

I was actually going to, that was my next question is I noticed for the first three to four days of kind of that. I don't want to call it a V because it's not yet. Probably go L. But the first, the first three or four days were I thought kind of moving up. I thought semi quickly. But then it seemed to really start slow down and it sounds like from your opinion, it's been mostly slow across the board. So what do you think of the buying behavior that you saw over the first few days compared to what it looks like now? I would say the buying behavior hasn't been really strong in that boy, the selling was pretty definitely panic mode.

And when they did that, they ended up getting to the point where they were, they were really losing a ton of money. They ended up asking me what to do and I'm thinking, all right, let's see. You could start looking at whether or not you want to buy or whatever get ready for the next cycle the other way. It's a little early to do that because you're in the middle of the downswing, but you know, it's crazy. People just don't think ahead they'll have one way of thinking one strategy and they, you know, in their 10 favorite stocks or something. And there's a whole world. I mean, there's thousands of physicians out there that you could diversify into I'm trading 35 futures markets now I'm trading multiple indicators multiple time period. So, you know, in any, I look at a screen any one day I've got red and green on the screen. I just hope that the green is a little more than the red.

And let's say it's a similar scenario though, let's say that there's still long only which to me is that it's kind of a big crutch because you you miss a lot of different things you can do, but keeping that same level set long only. When you're talking to them about creating a plan, what kind of things would you tell them to take a look at with that plan? The first thing I'd always ask is do you have stop losses on your positions? If you're buying hold and you have no idea where you're going to get out of anything, you don't have a complete trading plan. Think you should have an entry, you should have an exit, trailing stop of some sort. If you have profit objectives and you're trying to limit your gains, not a big fan of that, but there's some strategies where it makes some sense, I suppose. And if you're going to have that, put the limit order in there and take your profit on part of your position or whatever you want to do. But have a total plan. So it's the plan to get",

Then on top of that, you got to have a plan for how to size your position. Number two, and that's sometimes is more important than I think the first things we talked about, all the buying and selling. Because if you size something too much, you put yourself in harm's way. If you size yourself too small, you might have a great return, but it won't affect your portfolio positively enough for you to make the money you needed to make on that one to pay for the losers that are no doubt going to be able to get out. So you've got to be in balance all the time and position sizing is so important with that. And then the last thing is if you're going to be long only.

But then there's going to be times when the Japanese young goes down let's say and I have the potential to pick up a shorter term profits so I have a counter trend trading strategy that's on the order of days that would quickly reverse and I've sized them so that the counter trend strategy is roughly twice the size of the long term strategy and the reason for twice. Twice is very quickly as it pops off of an overbought oversold condition I take half of that profit off the table and it pays for the trade. So this is an attempt to get my reliability up to 50 or more. I'm not looking to get rich off those counter trend shades I'm just looking to buffer what I know will be a drastic pullback in a long term strategy from a peak or a trough as it gets back all the way to its stop loss which because it's a long term strategy",

So I have all these different things going on, but those two strategies are going to tend to completely fight each other during certain periods of time and essentially take my net position down to near the zero right roughly now you but that's by design notice I designed it that way. So if you careful about doing stuff like that then you can up your amount of position sizing because you know that you're protected from that drastic drawdown that would happen if you didn't have that second counter trend strategy in there you know that long term strategy is really going to hit you hard if you size it what's the long term strategies I run in my own case that's a retirement portfolio and I'm pretty seasoned I can handle some rest but I don't like to take on a lot of things.

Well I would look for the smallest possible contracts so the micro ether is fairly small so the crypto futures contract on the ether side not the Bitcoin that's bigger but the ether is very small the lumber the new lumber contract they just came out with is very small. You could probably find a micro soybean contract or corn contract that would be fairly small. Um. British pound contract isn't massive you could probably do that one. I'll give you a start at least make sure if you do silver make sure you do the 1000 ounce not the not the 5000 which is five times larger. Sugar is not overly large. I think it's a great list the reason I asked those questions is a lot of people will ask me about starting like an option portfolio with 5000 dollars.

Do you find some markets get the same strategy, other markets get different strategies? Or how do you think about splitting those? I do it more on the basis of what time period and what kind of math I'm trying to put in place on a portfolio.

If it's milk or something and it trades 20 contracts a day and that's for five minutes of the day, chances are that's not going to be in my portfolio. But if it's something like crude oil, it's trading 24 hours a day practically and can handle as much sizes I want to throw at it, then that's a natural one that's going to be in the portfolio. Once I get the portfolio of liquid, reasonably sized contracts or stocks or ETFs or whatever it is I'm trying to trade, I at that point would apply the math across the board. Got it. Yeah. And to your point, it sounds like one of the things I really enjoy listening to the way that you structure your portfolio, it's it's built seemingly for robustness, right? You're coming up with something that works and it's not overly complicated. You're not overlaying it so that it becomes this really niche thing so that you can step away and fix your irrigation, where a lot of other people they might not have that that structure if it starts getting too complicated and your volatility adjusting everything. It seems traders start going down that rabbit hole sooner or later where they really start trying to overfit and over modulate every single component. Yeah, I'm not a fan.

I keep the parameter, so it's very low and I try to keep the robustness up as high as possible so that basically any major run that has happened in the last three, four years I'm in on. Right. Without a doubt. Yeah. One of the other questions I wanted to ask you specifically about the the RSI stochastic that you like to use, how do you avoid things like whipsaw in oscillators in general? I use a timing indicator or a trunfiling indicator to trigger it. Okay. I don't go in on the overbought oversold. I just go in, I look at the conditions overbought so I need to think about going short. So where is my short going to come in? I put a stop in and when it executes it's starting to relieve itself from that overbought condition. And I will not go in until the trunfiling model goes over. So I miss I miss out on a little bit of the overbought condition. If you're really doing true mean reversion, then you're now you got a lot of trouble with your overbought, but you stay overbought and you stay overbought and you keep shorting and stopping out and then you're still overbought and eventually you'll be right",

I'm not trying to catch the very tippy top or the very, you know, low bottom because I find timing those pivots to be as difficult as it sounds to get the day right is real real tricky.

Now, we have a few minutes left when you're overlaying your trend following with your oscillators. How have you dialed in what you're using for your trend following so that it fits well with your oscillators? I don't know that I have. I'm just using the sharder term. I'm using a conditional indicator to say that it's overbought oversold over 21 days. So that's just I feel like if I can look at the last month of prices and this is stretched one way or the other, that's all I care about knowing. I don't need that. And then to time it, I am picking a time period that is so short compared to my long term that I know it will offset a lot of the drawdown risk of the long term strategy. So it's all in a design. I'm not trying to match my short term trend following trigger to the overbought oversold condition because to me, it's two two separate things. I just want to know that I'm stretched and then I want a very short term trigger. So it's all designed to give me what I want. I see.",

    "text": "website these days. So perfect. Then I'll get everybody there because we have to get you down the valley because you have a birthday. We have to go get out there and celebrate. But thank you for celebrating some of it with us. We're absolutely stoked to chat with you. I always enjoy the opportunity to pick your brain a little bit and hopefully pull nuggets out for people to think about how it can apply to their own trading because it's always awesome to be able to talk with seasoned folks like you. So thanks for hanging out. Yeah, my pleasure Eric. It's always fun talking to you as well. Awesome. Beautiful. We'll catch everybody next time being outlier. See y'all later.",
