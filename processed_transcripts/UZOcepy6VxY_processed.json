I fixed an irrigation leak in the backyard and I was flagged by that I couldn't figure out and I finally found the leak and got to it and repaired the header and everything's working beautifully now. So I love that. Happy day. I find a big part of home ownership is irrigation maintenance because I literally I literally have two little like hand carts one upstairs, one downstairs, literally for fixing irrigation, which I do all the time. So it sounds like it's a mutual experience because I forgot you're up in the mountains. So I am now. Yeah, I got two houses. We go down to the valley. In the Scottsdale area north Scottsdale for the winter usually, but I'm going down this afternoon because I'm meeting up with some family are coming in from the airport. So I get to go out to dinner with everyone tonight. That's so awesome. I'm stoked. Well, you're looking you're looking great. You're probably healthier than I am right now. So I got a pernated disk. So your boy is. I had a bulging disk that blew good when I was see what I would have been about 50 years old. It finally ruptured and oh my gosh, bad pain. Yeah, and I got a good one. Fortunately, I got",

Yeah, and I got a good one. Fortunately, I got one of those fancy shots with the very long needles and surprisingly 15 minutes later after the shot, I walked out completely normal and I haven't had any problem since. Maybe I need to find that shot because mine's been going on for like two weeks and it's not been super fun. So I'll I'll have to look into it, but enough about my broken back. Let's talk about some some markets. So I figured a good place to start actually is with the recent sell off that we had. What do you make of that? We saw it kind of across the indices and yeah, what are your thoughts there? Yeah, I just think it's we had a long time of a lot of up move, a lot of concentration of the money into things like NVIDIA. And I think what ended up happening is everybody was sitting there, you know, having made some nice money and getting a little itchy to take those profits. And I think when the thing started falling in for any excuse, it was like a match on a bunch of gasoline. You know, all of a sudden you had a firestorm. And then",

And then now the last week or so it's been trying to climb its way back out of the hole, but. Boy today was one of the quietest days I've ever seen. I gave up and went and fixed irrigation. It was a lot more interesting. And I tied down some netting in the vegetable garden and did some pruning and had a nice day outside took a shower put on the uniform for the inner. And yeah, it's been a nice relaxing day, but there was no point for me to be at my desk for sure. Yeah, one of the things that I thought was interesting to your point, I felt very similar with the sell off. It felt like we had a very just one sided move. It's hard to classify like what over done is, but it just seemed like we're going up. And to me, when the market does that for long enough to your point, I always get the sense that you kind of never know what's going to tilt it, but something typically does.

So when you see the market take a bite on a day like the fifth, what do you make of that? Do you think that's kind of just where the market is deciding this is a value area? I like it here. Sell off enough for what do you think? Well, what I think actually is a supply and demand of orders with a lot of computer power behind it means things are going to move very fast and a lot of people are going to adjust their positions very, very quickly. And because of the speed they can do that, I don't know that the support area to me, at least, would be magical at all. I think I think it's just that everybody that wanted to take a profit or sell or get nervous or do whatever they want to do had done it. So the selling kind of subsides a little bit and then everybody starts looking at everybody and deciding, do I want to be the hero that steps in and starts making it go up again.

They've been really, it's been very quiet and making new highs every day, but it's not very much of a new high and the bars are getting skinny. Yeah, that it's funny. I was actually going to, that was my next question is I noticed for the first three to four days of kind of that. I don't want to call it a V because it's not yet. Probably go L. But the first, the first three or four days were I thought kind of moving up. I thought semi quickly. But then it seemed to really start slow down and it sounds like from your opinion, it's been mostly slow across the board. So what do you think of the buying behavior that you saw over the first few days compared to what it looks like now? I would say the buying behavior hasn't been really strong in that boy, the selling was pretty definitely panic mode. And so if this thing touches off again, you could have another leg down and you could be into a full fledged bear market. And a lot of the traders that got their stimulus checks",

It could get ugly and could get ugly quickly and it could be take a real bite out of a lot of people's portfolios that they aren't careful. The answer is just to simply think about what you're doing and have a plan. On long positions I can hedge stuff, I can time out of things, I can go short on some of my strategies. I'm not at all worried about a market sell off. It could be actually profitable, but to not have a plan is to fail. Yeah, yeah, completely. To see that, you know, what'll end up happening is, you know, I have a big presence on Twitter and everything and people DM me all the time. And unfortunately, a month or two into the next bear market, whenever it occurs, and if I'm still alive, we will get these DMs and say something to Bob Mr. Baso.

You could start looking at whether or not you want to buy or whatever get ready for the next cycle the other way. It's a little early to do that because you're in the middle of the downswing, but you know, it's crazy. People just don't think ahead they'll have one way of thinking one strategy and they, you know, in their 10 favorite stocks or something. And there's a whole world. I mean, there's thousands of physicians out there that you could diversify into I'm trading 35 futures markets now I'm trading multiple indicators multiple time period. So, you know, in any, I look at a screen any one day I've got red and green on the screen. I just hope that the green is a little more than the red.

And let's say it's a similar scenario though, let's say that there's still long only which to me is that it's kind of a big crutch because you you miss a lot of different things you can do, but keeping that same level set long only. When you're talking to them about creating a plan, what kind of things would you tell them to take a look at with that plan? The first thing I'd always ask is do you have stop losses on your positions? If you're buying hold and you have no idea where you're going to get out of anything, you don't have a complete trading plan. Think you should have an entry, you should have an exit, trailing stop of some sort. If you have profit objectives and you're trying to limit your gains, not a big fan of that, but there's some strategies where it makes some sense, I suppose. And if you're going to have that, put the limit order in there and take your profit on part of your position or whatever you want to do. But have a total plan. So it's the plan to get",

So it's the plan to get in the plan to get out plan to for your initial stop any kind of trailing stop and any kind of method of taking profit. If there is going to be one. Then on top of that, you got to have a plan for how to size your position. Number two, and that's sometimes is more important than I think the first things we talked about, all the buying and selling. Because if you size something too much, you put yourself in harm's way. If you size yourself too small, you might have a great return, but it won't affect your portfolio positively enough for you to make the money you needed to make on that one to pay for the losers that are no doubt going to be able to get out. So you've got to be in balance all the time and position sizing is so important with that. And then the last thing is if you're going to be long only.

And I'll add to that things like gold things like industrial models things like energy contracts things like meats things like soft like cocoa and orange juice cocoa is at a really good year. You could have a tough time in stocks and sometimes there's some days where the cocoa position was pretty much providing the profits for the day just off of that one position it was just having that big of a move orange juice last year the same way. They may seem like wacko markets to trade, but they move they go up and down just like anything crypto is futures. You don't have to trade just in crypto if you don't trust the wallets and all that nonsense. And in the futures you can go long and short just as easily as anything.

So you just don't know or you could be short the crypto futures and the whole things caving in and the NASDAQs down and the cryptos is down and say you're losing money over there but you're making money on the other side it. There's lots of different return streams you can examine out there and when you start blending them all together all you do is smooth out your equity curve. Right so a lot of it building either inversely correlated moderately inversely correlated or more so to your point non correlated returns things. Non correlated non correlated is always the best. Yeah inversely correlated if you're attacking risk of a very specific nature like hedging a stockboard foils so you're long only on stocks. So you're short on a futures contract of say the stand in port is 500 or something those two are intentional inverse correlation item and you're trying to knock down the risk of the long port for you.

So when you're especially in your scenario 35 markets you have to size thoughtfully because the volatility of those markets will be different and those kind of capital value at risk will be different. So going back to our or DM this person reaches out you give them those three pieces of general advice and if they have a follow up question something like do you have any general guidance on sizing positions what would that look like.

Sizing positions a little bit of a function of the size of your account your risk tolerance I would say and how well you've designed your trading strategies to in some cases intentionally diversify or oppose each other for an example I have a long term future strategy with those 35 markets where I could be in a Japanese and trade for a year and a half. But then there's going to be times when the Japanese young goes down let's say and I have the potential to pick up a shorter term profits so I have a counter trend trading strategy that's on the order of days that would quickly reverse and I've sized them so that the counter trend strategy is roughly twice the size of the long term strategy and the reason for twice. Twice is very quickly as it pops off of an overbought oversold condition I take half of that profit off the table and it pays for the trade. So this is an attempt to get my reliability up to 50 or more. I'm not looking to get rich off those counter trend shades I'm just looking to buffer what I know will be a drastic pullback in a long term strategy from a peak or a trough as it gets back all the way to its stop loss which because it's a long term strategy",

So I have all these different things going on, but those two strategies are going to tend to completely fight each other during certain periods of time and essentially take my net position down to near the zero right roughly now you but that's by design notice I designed it that way. So if you careful about doing stuff like that then you can up your amount of position sizing because you know that you're protected from that drastic drawdown that would happen if you didn't have that second counter trend strategy in there you know that long term strategy is really going to hit you hard if you size it what's the long term strategies I run in my own case that's a retirement portfolio and I'm pretty seasoned I can handle some rest but I don't like to take on a lot of things.

It's not like portfolio but it's you're not getting a diversified portfolio you're getting one thing one name and then a collection of other garbage that really doesn't make much difference right to run a portfolio in my opinion. Yeah, just kind of noise.

So I don't build other positions but what so what was your point you were asking then I was curious about the time frames that you use for the longer term positions and the time frames you said it's just a few days time frames I would say long term would be anything say three weeks or beyond roughly so something like 21 days or beyond something like that 21.2 21 trading days is roughly a month you're starting to get into pretty long term periods there counter trend trading I'd be done in the three days or less right so two are in very different time frames I think if you do that you get a little bit of the action where if markets are going",

Meanwhile the long one is so long term that it just sort of sits there and doesn't do anything that be kind of what I try to be getting to. Yeah and then two other questions off that the first one is for that long position that's about three weeks out are you taking that into expiration and then rolling it back out or do you have earlier role period to maintain that exposure. I try to take each contract to the point where the new contract is trading at a larger volume and open interest than the only time and I just roll it so in the case of a year and a half trade depending on what you're talking about I might if it was like a crude oil contract and I happen to be in it that long it'd be something like 15 or 18 rolls that I would go.

Well I would look for the smallest possible contracts so the micro ether is fairly small so the crypto futures contract on the ether side not the Bitcoin that's bigger but the ether is very small the lumber the new lumber contract they just came out with is very small. You could probably find a micro soybean contract or corn contract that would be fairly small. Um. British pound contract isn't massive you could probably do that one. I'll give you a start at least make sure if you do silver make sure you do the 1000 ounce not the not the 5000 which is five times larger. Sugar is not overly large.

I just, my positions get larger. I probably go to the 40 markets instead of 35 and I keep growing and everything and adding maybe another strategy or two if it can handle it. Yeah. So when you think about going back to the different markets that you participate in, how do you think about divvying up your strategies between the different markets? Do you find some markets get the same strategy, other markets get different strategies? Or how do you think about splitting those? I do it more on the basis of what time period and what kind of math I'm trying to put in place on a portfolio and then I apply it uniformly to everything in the portfolio.

Once I get the portfolio of liquid reasonably sized contracts or stocks or ETFs or whatever it is I'm trying to trade, at that point would apply the math across the board. Got it. Yeah. And to your point, it sounds like one of the things I really enjoy listening to the way that you structure your portfolio, it's built seemingly for robustness, right? You're coming up with something that works and it's not overly complicated, you're not overlaying it so that it becomes this really niche thing so that you can step away and fix your irrigation where a lot of other people, they might not have that structure.

Yeah, not a fan. I keep the parameter sets very low and I try to keep the robustness up as high as possible so that basically any major run that has happened in the last three, four years I'm in on. Right. Without a doubt. Yeah. One of the other questions I wanted to ask you specifically about the RSI stochastic that you like to use. How do you avoid things like whipsaw in oscillators in general? I use the timing indicator or trying following indicator to trigger it. Okay. I don't go in on the overbought oversold. I just go in. I look at the conditions overbought so I need to think about going short so where is my short going to come in. I put a stop in and when it executes it's starting to relieve itself from that overbought condition and I will not go in until the trend following model goes over. So I miss I miss out on a little bit of the overbought condition. If you're really doing true mean reversion, then you're now you got a lot of trouble with your overbought but you",

Eventually you'll be right and you'll end up making even more money than say a countertrend with countertrend to me means you're using a trend following model but sort of in a short-term direction against the long-term trend. I prefer to do that. I'm not a main reversion guy. It just makes me super uncomfortable. Yeah. You have to have a very specific view of markets for that. I also it's funny because I identify a lot with your concept. I call it like not trying to top tick or bottom tick is the way I think about it. I'm not trying to catch the very tippy top or the very low bottom because I find timing those pivots to be as difficult as it sounds to get the day right is real real tricky.

Now we have a few minutes left when you're overlaying your trend following with your oscillators. How have you dialed in what you're using for your trend following so that it fits well with your oscillators? I don't know that I have. I'm just using the sharder term. I'm using a conditional indicator to say that it's over bought over sold over 21 days. So that's just I feel like if I can look at the last month of prices and this is stretched one way or the other that's all I care about knowing. I don't need that. And then to time it I am picking a time period that is so short compared to my long term that I know it will offset a lot of the draw down risk of the long term strategy. So it's all in the design. I'm not trying to match my short term trend following trigger to the over bought over sold condition because to me it's two two separate things. I'm just got it.

The last thing I wanted to ask you is looking out kind of rest of the year. Long time frame. Nobody really knows what's going to happen. But I'm curious what your general sense is. What kind of things interest you going into the tail half of the year? Well, I'm looking at adding the kneecai futures to my portfolio. So that'll be number 36.

And we're going to hold it in Malagas, Spain. Perfect. And we've got we've got lower cost structure over there. So it's a less expensive. So for all those US people that have been interested in going to a seminar and didn't like the price tag of the Las Vegas one. This one's about 2,000 cheaper because of the cost of paying.
