I fixed an irrigation leak in the backyard and I was flagged by that I couldn't figure out and I finally found the leak and got to it and repaired the header and everything's working beautifully now. So I love that. Happy day. I find a big part of home ownership is irrigation maintenance because I literally have two little like hand carts, one upstairs, one downstairs, literally for fixing irrigation, which I do all the time. So it sounds like it's a mutual experience because I forgot you're up in the mountains. I am now. Yeah. I got two houses. We go down to the valley in the Scottsdale area in North Scottsdale for the winter usually. But I'm going down this afternoon because I'm meeting up with some family or coming in from the airport. So I get to go out to dinner with everyone tonight. That's so awesome. I'm stoked. Well, you're looking great. You're probably healthier than I am right now. That's telling you I got a pernated disk. So your boy is I had a bulging disk that blew when I was, let's see, I would have been about 50 years old. It finally ruptured and oh my gosh, bad pain. Yeah. But unfortunately I got one of those fancy shots with the very",

But unfortunately I got one of those fancy shots with the very long needles and surprisingly 15 minutes later after the shot, I walked out completely normal and I haven't had any problem since. Well, maybe I need to find that shot because mine's been going on for like two weeks and it's not been super fun. So I'll have to look into it. But enough about my broken back. Let's talk about some markets. So I figured a good place to start actually is with the recent sell-off that we had. What do you make of that? We saw it kind of across the indices and yeah, what are your thoughts there? Yeah, I just think it's we had a long time of a lot of upmove, a lot of concentration of the money into things like NVIDIA. And I think what ended up happening is everybody was sitting there, you know, having made some nice money and getting a little itchy to take those profits. And I think when the things started falling in for any excuse, it was like a match on a bunch of gasoline. It just, you know, a little sudden you had a firestorm.

It just, you know, a little sudden you had a firestorm. And then now the the last week or so it's been trying to climb its way back out of the hole, but boy today was one of the quietest days I've ever seen. I gave up and went and fixed irrigation. It was a lot more interesting and I tied down some netting in the vegetable garden and did some pruning and had a nice day outside. Took a shower, put on the uniform for the interview. And yeah, it's been a nice relaxing day, but there was no point for me to be at my desk for sure. Yeah, one of the things that I thought was interesting to your point, I felt very similar with the sell-off. It felt like we had a very just one-sided move. It's hard to classify like what over done is, but it just seemed like we were going up. And to me, when the market does that for long enough to your point, I always get the sense that you kind of never know what's going to tilt it, but something typically does. What I thought was interesting though was the series of gap downs into kind of that really strong support day on the fifth where I mean, it had a pretty nasty",

So when you see the market take a bite on a day like the fifth, what do you make of that? Do you think that's kind of just where the market is deciding this is a value area? I like it here, sell-offs enough, or what do you think? Well, what I think actually is a supply and demand of orders with a lot of computer power behind it means things are going to move very fast and a lot of people are going to adjust their positions very, very quickly. And because of the speed they can do that, I don't know that the support area to me at least would be magical at all. I think it's just that everybody that wanted to take a profit or sell or get nervous or do whatever they want to do had done it. So the selling kind of subsides a little bit and then everybody starts looking at everybody and deciding do I want to be the hero that steps in and starts making it go up again?

They've been really, it's been very quiet and making new highs every day, but it's not very much of a new high and the bars are getting skinny. Yeah, that's funny. I was actually, that was my next question is I noticed for the first three to four days of kind of that, I don't want to call it a V because it's not yet. I like L. But the first the first three or four days were I thought kind of moving up, I thought semi-quickly, but then it seemed to really start slow down and it sounds like from your opinion, it's been mostly slow across the board. So what do you think of the buying behavior that you saw over the first few days compared to what it looks like now? I would say the buying behavior hasn't been really strong in that boy, the selling was pretty definitely panic mode. And so if this thing touches off again, you could have another leg down and you could be into a full fledged bear market. And a lot of the traders that got their stimulus checks back in 2000 when we had COVID and all that have been trading largely in market. They",

The answer is just to simply think about what you're doing and have a plan. I can head stuff, I can time out of things, I can go short on some of my strategies. I'm not at all worried about a market sell off, it could be actually profitable, but to not have a plan is to fail. Yeah, completely. I hate to see that. What will end up happening is I have a big presence on Twitter and everything. People DM me all the time. And unfortunately, a month or two into the next bear market whenever it occurs.

It's a little early to do that because you're in the middle of the downswing, but you know, it's crazy. People just think ahead. They'll have one way of thinking, one strategy and they, you know, and their ten favorite stocks or something. And there's a whole world. I mean, there's thousands of physicians out there that you could diversify into. I'm trading 35 futures markets now. I'm trading multiple indicators, multiple time period rates. So, you know, in any, I look at a screen any one day, I've got red and green on the screen. I just hope that the green is a little more than the red. You just can't, you know, do one thing one way. If you're going to do that, you're going to have to expect some severe drawdowns with no place to hide. You just can't avoid it. Yeah, part of seems to be part of the game. Now, exploring that scenario a little further, let's pretend that that person DMed you before the market dropped. And let's say it's a similar scenario though. Let's say that there's still long",

Let's say that there's still long only, which to me is kind of a big crutch because you miss a lot of different things you can do, but keeping that same level set long only. When you're talking to them about creating a plan, what kind of things would you tell them to take a look at with that plan? The first thing I'd always ask is do you have stock losses on your positions? If you're buying hold and you have no idea where you're going to get out of anything, you don't have a complete trading plan. Think you should have an entry, you should have an exit, trailing stock of some sort. If you have profit objectives and you're trying to limit your gains, not a big fan of that, but there's some strategies where it makes some sense, I suppose. And if you're going to have that, put the limit order in there and take your profit on part of your position or whatever you want to do, but have a total plan. So it's the plan to get in, the plan to get out, plan to for your initial stop, any kind of trailing stop and any kind of method of",

So it's the plan to get in, the plan to get out, plan to for your initial stop, any kind of trailing stop and any kind of method of taking profit if there is going to be one. Then on top of that, you got to have a plan for how to size your position. Number two, and that's sometimes more important than I think the first things we talked about, all the buying and selling. Because if you size something too much, you put yourself in harm's way. If you size yourself too small, you might have a great return, but it won't affect your portfolio positively enough for you to make the money you needed to make on that one to pay for the losers that are no doubt going to be there too. So you've got to be in balance all the time and position sizing is so important with that. Then the last thing is if you're going to be long only, can you try to stretch your portfolio out somehow? Example, you could be long only in stocks, but you could then also look at being long only in corn. In corn and stocks don't have anything to do with each other, so they're going to go up and down a different times. And I'll add to that things like gold, things like industrial",

Just off of that one position, it was just having that big of a move. Orange juice last year the same way. They may seem like wacko markets to trade, but they move. They go up and down just like anything. Crypto's futures. You don't have to trade just in crypto if you don't trust the wallets and all that nonsense. And in the futures you can go long and short just as easily as anything. So I trade the Bitcoin futures and the Ether futures. And they move. When they move a lot, you make a lot of money. They can be doing that at a completely different time when, say, the NASDAQ is having a rough day or the Russell's having a bad day. All of a sudden the crypto futures are having a good day.

So a lot of it building either inversely correlated, moderately, inversely correlated or more so to your point non correlated returns things. Non correlated. Non correlated is always the best. Yeah. inversely correlated if you're attacking risk of a very specific nature like hedging a stockboard foils. So you're long only on stocks. You're short on a futures contract of say the standard port is 500 or something. Those two are intentional inverse correlation item. And you're trying to knock down the risk of the long port foilio.

Unless I look at the screen 35 is getting beyond my 72 year old brain to absorb almost tickers and and realize which way I am. So thank goodness for computers and spreadsheets. So when you're especially in your scenario, 35 markets, you have to size thoughtfully because the volatility of those markets will be different and those kind of capital value at risk will be different. So going back to our our DM, this person reaches out, you give them those three pieces of general advice. And if they have a follow up question, something like, do you have any general guidance on sizing positions? What would that look like? Sizing positions is a little bit of a function of the size of your account, your risk tolerance, I would say. And how well you've designed your trading strategies to in some cases intentionally diversify or oppose each other.

But then there's going to be times when the Japanese Yand goes down, let's say, and I have the potential to pick up a shorter term profits. So I have a counter trend trading strategy that's on the order of days that would quickly reverse. And I sized them so that the counter trend strategy is roughly twice the size of the long term strategy. And the reason for twice is very quickly as it pops off of an overbought oversold condition, I take half of that profit off the table and it pays for the trade. So this is an attempt to get my reliability up to 50 or more. And I'm not looking to get rich off those counter trend shades, I'm just looking to buffer what I know will be a drastic pullback in a long term strategy from a peak or a trough as it gets back all the way to its stop loss, which because it's a long term strategy is going to be fairly far away. So I have all these different things going on, but those two strategies are going to tend to completely fight each other during certain periods",

So I have all these different things going on, but those two strategies are going to tend to completely fight each other during certain periods of time and essentially take my net position down to near to zero. Right, roughly. Now, but that's by design, notice I designed it that way. So if you're careful about doing stuff like that, then you can up your amount of position sizing because you know that you're protected from that drastic drawdown that would happen if you didn't have that second counter trend strategy in there, you know that long term strategy is really going to hit you hard. If you size it, what's the long term strategies, I run in my own case, it's a retirement portfolio and I'm pretty seasoned. I can handle some rest, but I don't like to take on a huge amount. I run my positions at a half of 1 of equity. So I would take say a corn contract, I calculate where the stop was, I would calculate the value in dollars per bushel or since per bushel of how far that stop is, and then I would equate that to my equity and figure out how many contracts do I need to get to a half of 1?

Yeah, so I think on dollars has also the problem of if you think about it, let's say you get in the video and your portfolio and you have some utility stock. They're different prices drastically, they're very different in the speed that they move in the percentages that they move per position each day.

I always make sure, use your price charts, use your technique, use your calculator bands and Bollinger bands and Dungeon bands and whatever you use for your buying cell.

Now that you know one share or in the case of futures, one contract, same way, then do your calculation and say, okay, what would be a half of one per cent of my current equity?

Divided out and it tells you, I don't know, do 8.9 shares or 80, 89 shares and that's the number you do. It's easy. Yeah, yeah. When you're looking at the positions that you're building in futures and you have a longer term position, shorter term position, what time frames are you using for those? I don't build positions typically because a study I did once showed that the initial trend following signal is always your best return to risk and I'm a big return to risk fan. So I really don't want to build additional positions on. Are there trades where it would make sense and that you possibly could even find some low risk add-ons where you could build a bigger position?

I was curious about the time frames that you use for the longer term positions and the time frames you said it's just a few days. Time frames I would say long term would be anything say three weeks or beyond roughly. So something like 21 days or beyond something like that. 21 trading days is roughly a month. You're starting to get into pretty long term periods there. Counter trend trading I'd be done in the three days or less. Right. So two are in very different time frames. I think if you do that, you get a little bit of the action where if markets are going sideways, you're going to get that short term one kicking in and out and trying to whipsaw a little bit, but hopefully taking small losses. Meanwhile, the long one is so long term that it just sort of sits there and doesn't do anything. That'd be kind of what I'd try to be getting to. Yeah. And then two other questions off that.

Completely separate design to be separate, designed to counter or pose each other, but I trade each strategy distinctly according to the prices and the mechanisms and the timing period and parameters sets and all that that were the original design for us. It's a very specific purpose. Each strategy has its own sort of job in the crew. The crew comes together and does its thing and builds my portfolio every day, but each one has a job to do and then on after worry about what Joe over here is doing. Right, right. He's got a bit of attention to what he's doing. So makes total sense. Now if you were thinking about the same portfolio structure, you were saying 35 names, obviously you're a season pro and you're kind of like, that's about where I want to be. If you were talking to somebody that has a little bit less experience or maybe not the bandwidth to monitor 35, what kind of number of positions do you think would make sense for just like a general guidance? Let's say it's somebody that's trying to that DM or they're trying to grow their account over the next 20 years. I'll give you a couple answers.

If you can get that together, you got a reasonable shot at now, diversifying a little bit. I'd be shooting for probably about 10 positions. You know, if you're just going to be in the stock market, you're going to get a lot of correlation amongst stocks. So do which you can define different industries that you can put your positions in. Don't just all go out and put it all in tech names or something. You're going to take a much wilder ride if you do that. Then I'd also consider micro futures. There's some very small futures contracts that you could do five stocks and maybe five futures contracts and get a little blend going. That way you got better diversification, you're gaining your experience level on both sides. Keep trying to make money and keep trying to add to the portfolio. Keep your capital growing.

You get up into the, say, a hundred thousand, a hundred thousand area and maybe at that point I would see maybe 20 positions would be logical. Maybe 10 of them in futures and 10 of them in stocks, something like that spread it around a little bit and then it's just more of the same as you get larger. Got it. Quick question on the smaller portfolio, the idea of like five futures, give or take five individual names. What kind of futures would you focus on? Obviously, if you're trading the micros, you are heavily limited by finding things that are good and liquid. There's a handful of things that probably would fit that category. But I'm curious which you'd be thinking about. Well, I would look for the smallest possible contracts. So the micro ether is fairly small. So the crypto futures contract on the ether side, not the bitcoin, that's bigger. But the ether is very small. The number, the new lumber contract, they just came out with is very small. You could probably find a micro soybean contract or corn contract that would be fairly small. British pound contract isn't massive. You could probably do that one. I would give you a",

Make sure if you do silver, make sure you do the 1000 ounce, not the 5000, which is five times larger. Sugar is not over really large. Micro or many natural gas is not very large. Probably trade that one. Aussie dollar is not massive. You could probably look at that one. Those are some of the start at least. I think it's a great list. The reason I asked those questions is a lot of people will ask me about starting like an options portfolio with 5,000. And I always struggle with that one. It's like as soon as you place a single trade, you're missized. Like you already are in a bad spot. So I kind of asked you the hard question. I made you do the heavy work there by coming up with a bunch of good names. So thank you for that. The options options are a hands-on problem for a lot of people.

So trying to get that reduced down into the actual underlying underpinning of your profits and losses is far more difficult. Futures to me seems simple compared to options. Absolutely. Yeah, they absolutely are. And I can put in stops and go out and fix irrigation or go play golf or whatever. No problem. I come back in and do my afternoon work, my data run, and I find out what I got executed today. Right. Yeah. It's one of the nastiest things I find about just the market in general and what expectations are. Because a lot of people, they find their way into options thinking that it's fast, easy, leveraged money and exactly to your point. It's why so many people just evaporate their money because it's essentially anything but that. So yeah.

I do it more on the basis of what time period and what kind of math I'm trying to put in place on a portfolio. And then I apply it uniformly to everything in the portfolio. Everything that I think has a shot at being liquid. I mean, before it gets into any portfolio, I'd like markets that are liquid and can handle the size that I'm going to throw at it. If it's a, I don't know, milk or something and it trades, you know, 20 contracts a day and that's for five minutes of the day, yeah, chances are that's not going to be in my portfolio. But if it's something like crude oil that's trading 24 hours a day practically and can handle as much sizes I want to throw at it, then that's a natural one that's going to be in the portfolio. Once I get the portfolio of liquid reasonably sized contracts or stocks or ETFs or whatever it is I'm trying to trade. At that point, it would apply the math across the board. Got it. Yeah.

And to your point, it sounds like one of the things I really enjoy listening to the way that you structure your portfolio, it's it's built seemingly for robustness, right? You're coming up with something that works and it's not overly complicated. You're not overlaying it so that it becomes this really niche thing so that you can step away and fix your irrigation where a lot of other people, they might not have that that structure. If it starts getting too complicated and your volatility adjusting everything, it seems traders start going down that rabbit hole sooner or later where they really start trying to overfit and over modulate every single component. Yeah, I'm not a fan. I keep the parameter sets very low and I try to keep the robustness up as high as possible so that basically any major run that has happened in the last three, four years I'm in on. Right. Without without a doubt. Yeah. One of the one of the other questions I wanted to ask you specifically about the the RSI stochastic that you like to use, how do you avoid things like whipsaw in oscillators in general?

I'm trading an individual portfolio. So I don't know if I can even get the data for this market. But we're going to do some more research on that. I'm still working on SIM Trader. So we're still trying to automate that last now seventh strategy that I run that I still do by hand every day. It doesn't take a lot of time. But you know, it could be 25 minutes on a good day, something like that. But I'd like to get it done to about five minutes and free up my time more. So that's being done. And just watch what's happening with the election. And going a couple of trips, we've got a seminar coming up with Lauren's Benzdorp in October. And we're going to hold it in Malagas, Spain. Perfect.

So for all those US people that have been interested in going to a seminar and didn't like the price tag of the Las Vegas one. This one's about 2,000 cheaper because of the cost of paying. And you get Malagas Spain, which is right on the Mediterranean tucked right behind Gibraltar. The weather there is like Scottsdale with the senior by it is gorgeous. I've been there once before.

But thank you for celebrating some of it with us. We're absolutely stoked to chat with you. I always enjoy the opportunity to pick your brain a little bit and hopefully pull nuggets out for people to think about how it can apply to their own trading because it's always awesome to be able to talk with seasoned folks like you.
