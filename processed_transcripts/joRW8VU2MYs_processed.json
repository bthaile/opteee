It's about GameStopNakedShorting. I'll show you the context of it. This is it. I started going through it. There is a bunch of different versions of this kind of research, but I thought it would be kind of cool to go through this together as well. So that's the agenda for today. I figure I'll get us kicked off. We'll start as per usual with just looking through GameStop, kind of analyzing where things sit today. I actually had a really funny comment on one of my videos. Somebody effectively said they were like, yo, Eric, you must have some crazy OCD if you're still covering GameStop, which I thought was kind of funny because I think people are very temperamental, meaning if something's like interesting, they go all in and they focus on it super heavily. And then if things lose their interest, they pivot very quickly. Whereas it's exact opposite for me. Typically, once I start doing something, unless there's some sort of significant reason why I would change, I typically just kind of keep on the path. And it's why you see kind of the consistency I have, right? The only time that you've seen me miss any of these live",

The only time that you've seen me miss any of these live streams is either the one time I was sick or if I'm traveling and even when I'm traveling, I still fit these in. And it's just kind of how I'm hardwired. The reason why I'm mentioning this point is because when you're analyzing something like markets, you have to be really consistent in what you're looking at, how you're studying it, because there's so much information that you have to pick up that it's literally impossible to do it kind of like if you're in this ebb and flow cycle. So all that aside, let's get into it. Looks like we got Fuzzy here hanging out and we also got Dark Mark. Great to see both of you. And I assume we'll get other people popping in as we go. And then the first starting point here is I would love to hear from you in the chat specifically just to get a qualitative sense of where you think GameStop is.

But if you were to think about what the dominant force right now for GameStop more broadly is, meaning the priorities for leadership, do you think it's optimizing the existing business or do you think it's researching planning and preparing to pivot into something else? What say you? Be dizzle also great to see you. And I realize that this window is a little off skew. That's okay. That'd be all right. Let's click over here. And while you're letting me know your thoughts, the reason why I'm asking this is because of how GameStop is trading. And I'm going to give you my opinion in a moment. But I am genuinely curious. Marcelo says both. Be dizzle says I'm hoping for a pivot, but I can't help but feel it might still be a ways out in Ryan's focusing on the overall business. Jesse Juice says I think it's a blend. I do think there's a larger pivot behind the scenes to collectibles. I don't think Ryan Cohen's desire to challenge Amazon has gone away. That's a really interesting point. Dylan",

Good to see you, Dylan. What is Dylan? You're a great example. Dylan, what has led to you kind of stepping away from the GameStop sphere? I'm actually very, very curious is that you know, just got busy, deprioritized things were moving slow. You're the exact person. I'm very curious in right now because I think that what you're talking about and what you're saying is actually broadly representative of what I imagine a lot of people are feeling right now. Jesse says but the business optimization steps are crucial steps to make that transformation work. Is that the case though? Because there are a lot of people that think GameStop should take like this really hard pivot. One of the examples I see is GameStop effectively becoming like a holding company. Again, I personally don't see that route, but like let's just take it what it is, whether we agree with it or not. And if GameStop were to go that route, something like trying to become a holding company, I think that we would actually see a very different response rate than",

It's actually one of the dominant reasons why I don't think GameStop is going the route of becoming a holding company because if GameStop's plan was to become a holding company, going through this long, arduous process of trying to reconfigure the business is a massive opportunity cost. And it's trying to salvage something that I think more broadly speaking, we know is a very challenged field, meaning brick and mortar stores in general, but let alone brick and mortar stores related to video games, devices and peripherals. So from that lens, I actually think we can use that information to come up with a decent understanding of why GameStop is making the moves that it is. And I think the fact that GameStop is going through and from the video I released on Wednesday, you'll see that there's a bunch more store closings and stuff like that. And I feel like if GameStop was going the route of being a holding company, you'd actually see that accelerate massively.

It's stuff that's like way, way, way broader scoped in that if they were going to make that big of a pivot. Dylan says I saw GameStop is a brick business. And although I like the cash, I think no debt, I just saw the rest of the market making moves. And with all respect, how to get out of game, get out of the GameStop sandbox. I think it's smart. And I think that's one of the cool things, at least I hope, about the way that I talk about GameStop and the way that I explore the space with everybody, because I really apply the lens of a trader. Like that's what I am. Is I trade for for a living? It's how I make money.

I'm actually using that way more as hopefully a learning point for you all to show you how you can apply something like a covered Strangle basic option strategies in something like GameStop for a lot of people who maintain GameStop holdings. Because that is the reality. The vast majority of people I feel that tune into the live streams are likely people that are primarily GameStop holders versus traders, like more so with what I represent. So yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense. Jesse says, you make good points. I wish the CEO was more forthcoming. It's been a little exhausting not going to lie. I actually fully understand that.

    "text": "doing is very strategic in nature. So I respect it from that lens. However, the other part of me does believe in order to inspire confidence from people, you have to key them in a bit. And this is why normally when you see other companies going through their earnings releases, there are these giant earnings presentations, there's forecasts, there's expectations for the next quarter, literally for the entire next year. There's some analysis shared on the context of like what's the current trade, what's the current market landscape, the economic landscape as it pertains to the business. And GameStop, you really don't see any of that. Now, I think part of it is wise to keep the cards semi close to the chest. But I also don't fully buy that. And it's because there's nothing like super secret that GameStop's working on that all of these other companies aren't working on tangentially or similarly related endeavors that are still able to talk about some of these things. So that part I actually don't understand why they manage it that way. Actually, I'm really curious. Let me see if I want to know of ChatGPT as a perspective of some sort on this. Because let me tell you what the question is, we're going to ask, okay. So we want to ask why does Ryan Cohen and GameStop refer to minimize shareholder communications during things like earnings releases, where other companies share analysis, future expectations, broad plans, etc. I want",

So we want to ask why does Ryan Cohen and GameStop refer to minimize shareholder communications during things like earnings releases, where other companies share analysis, future expectations, broad plans, etc. I want to know, like ChatGPT says, might have an angle that we're not considering. Ryan Cohen and GameStop have adapted a low communication strategy, particularly in earnings calls. The reasoning behind this approach appears to be deliberate and aligns with Cohen's broader philosophy. Strategic reasons for limited communication. Avoid overpromising and legal risks, letting execution speak instead of words. Hedge against market manipulation, which that I do believe, differentiation from Wall Street norms. This is the main thing I actually think of. Is the fact that Cohen is really known for taking a slightly offbeat approach to markets, to being a business owner, to being a CEO. And that's actually what I would consider to be a larger function. He's just doing shit different. That's part of what I think he does. As he says, I'm hoping this Q4 is different than in that regard. Seems like there's going to be some sort of reveal of an investment in more info on the new PSA trading cards. I used to feel the same as you there, but I have to be honest, I don't feel that way personally. I would not be surprised at all if during this earnings release, there's",

I would not be surprised at all if during this earnings release, there's not a call. And it's just the filing of the forms. That wouldn't surprise me in the least. And the reason being is because if there's some sort of news with respect to an investment, more often than not, we'll see artifacts of it. Now, that doesn't mean it couldn't be the case, definitely could, but typically speaking, when there's some sort of larger scale investment potential, normally you see it start to bleed out little areas where information finds its way out and gets baked into things like the options markets. You typically can see small artifacts of it. And sometimes you don't know what the artifact is as you're looking at it happening, meaning it could be the specific open interest or volume build out of a specific option that's anomalous. So we don't always know exactly why, but we definitely can typically see something at least that then would confirm the information in the future. But yeah, it would be really interesting.

I pay for a few of them because I like to be able to test different ideas and see how they behave differently. I think it also depends on the tasks that you're trying to do. That's a big differentiator. But for example, recently both perplexity and chat GPT have launched like deeper research and chat GPT just launched 4.5, which is good for reasoning and deeper thoughts. I think that they're all very useful in different ways, but I think that broadly, they're all super similar right now. I really don't see huge differences between them. For example, if I'm generally searching things, I have a preference for perplexity because I think it does a better job more quickly going through different sources and citing them.

I think what I try to do with stuff like this specifically as well is I try to make sure that traders are able to identify like the opportunity that you have in front of you.

So it's where we can kind of blend both of our worlds where hopefully I can lend some of my 18 years of trading experience to help you, meaning the you identify different ways to do things, different ways of thinking and different paths you can take in order to create success in markets because markets are challenging.

This steep drop consolidation, steep drop, small rebound consolidation, not a comparatively super steep drop, but still a big drop right from 27 down to 24. That's a big move, right? For doesn't look big on the chart, but that's simply because of the scale of the moves that GameStop has. Now it's been trending sideways unfortunately. I don't love this slight negative drift. And it's a little hard to see, but it's there. So if we zoom in a little bit more and we take a look just at the bottoms of these candles, there's a slight drift down across. So that means that there's still an element of a little bit more weakness, but it does look like the market overall at least has a degree of consensus on near-term price and value of GameStop. Because if I'm not mistaken, I think the intrinsic value just cash assets for GameStop writ large is like 12 or 13 bucks or something like that. So it's not like it's trading at any sort of meaningful premium over its intrinsic value. I think we have to keep a really close eye on this though.

And that's because one, if you've watched my other streams, you know that I'm pretty quick to talk about the difference, at least in my perception, of market manipulation versus general market activity. And I do not subscribe to the broad view of everything is fake, nothing is real. The game's completely rigged against you. I just don't believe that. I do believe that there are absolutely demonstrable instances of manipulation. We can see it in a lot of different ways, especially when we're looking at something like GameStop. The fact that we closed at 24 at 24 even on Friday. I am not in the camp where everybody says, each and every week, oh wow, you know, GameStop closed at blank right below this next price level. Obviously it's the market makers suppressing the price, right? Because like no matter what week we're in, GameStop's always going to close below some sort of level just like any other stock. So I think it starts to become disingenuous when we always say that. This Friday though, real fucking interesting, real interesting. That's a very inside day on a gap down on a broader period where the average daily range is significant. And right on the nose, open and close.",

This will probably get me completely demonetized for everything, but I don't make any money off this anyways. All right, kids, it is now my job to teach you the theory of evolution. Oh boy.

    "text": "that. This one. I don't know if this does like historic Max Payne. I do know bar chart does it. Let's see what Max. So for those unfamiliar with the concept of Max Payne, the idea is market makers. I have a video on it. I'll throw it in the chat for you guys. But the concept behind Max Payne is that the market makers are incentivized to try and cause an expiration that yields Max Payne. And Max Payne is where the largest number of options would expire worthless, which is easier for them on the market, making side of things to manage. Now again, Max Payne is not the woe of every down move that you see in the market. And then another really, really, really common misconception is not understanding that Max Payne moves. So as options are traded, Max Payne will move. So it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy in certain circumstances, not always. If there's a really big build out of options, that happens to be super far away from Max Payne. And it just is what it is. Then there can be a big variance between them. But like for example, this doesn't let me go back in time. But if you take a look at just overall Max Payne, you can see between calls and puts here. But you can see where Max Payne is for next week, 60TE, right now it's 25. If you monitor this throughout the week, it's going to move.",

If you monitor this throughout the week, it's going to move. So it's an important note. Let's see if this one lets us go back in time. This is for next week. I'm so surprised that these don't track historic. That's a little, I don't know what Max Payne was. Do any of you guys know what Max Payne was for yesterday? I'm really surprised that none of these have any sort of historic way to go back and look at what it was. BDOS says 25. Yeah, that's actually a great example. The fact that Max Payne is all the way up at 25 and it closed at 24, it's not even closed to it. But obviously the market makers, I think, still had a vested interest in the fight of trying to get it to, they would have preferred to be at 2399. But the fact that it was at 24 would lead me to believe that there was resistance. So any questions on where GameStop sits today, anything that we should look at in particular, do you think, or are you guys ready to go through the D.E. library and continue down the path?

There's two things I want to look at. Oh, yeah, I forgot. I told you I would go through the coverage triangle. SPNR will says chart exchange says 24.50. Was that for yesterday or is that for next week? Let's take a look at the coverage triangle really fast. I'll get down here for GameStop. So this is what the position sits at today. And again, this is like the model position that I share with you all to use as an example. The last couple trades that were made were on the 4th of March. And I think I covered this in the video from last week. So I won't spend a lot of time on it. The couple things to keep in mind. First, you can see that the puts that came down here on that originally were sold on 30 Jan, this line item. The puts came down at a small loss. You could consider this a role or you could consider it whatever you want. But effectively, what I wanted to do here was take these puts down mostly because they were starting to be challenged. And you can see what the strike price was for them. So the strike price was 25. And all I did was take those",

Effectively, what we're doing is we're moving the two points between these two. And this will show us like what the percent change is. And there's a more important point to this, which is this. The cash secured put change is the total amount of money. It's going to take us to cash secure the new position versus the old position. So the way that we would do the math for something like this, which you can track for yourself, we effectively would take the new strike, whatever that is, multiply that by the size, meaning how many contracts multiply that by 100. That's the starting point. So in this case, it's a five lot here. Close that off. And then we would subtract this times the trade size times 100. It's freezing again. That's why it's taking its time. Where do we miss? That's there. I see we need one more. There we go. And this one is also should be a five lot. So here's what happens.

It's not just because of that. It's because by moving this strike, two points, I decrease the amount that I have to have in order to cash secure the position by 1,000. That is not a ton of money, but relative to the portfolio value of 25k, that's actually not an inconsequential amount of money. It's like 4. So by adjusting things this way, it gives me an ability to move the basis around so that as GameStop is going down, I can take in shares when I'm ready at an improved basis that makes sense for the broader portfolio. Now, realistically, that could have been at 25, because my current basis is at 28.21. No problem taking in the shares at 25. However, if you take a look at how much is currently utilized, we absolutely have this space to take those shares on via assignment if we were so inclined. But I want to wait and see where GameStop levels off. And then I can choose either to allow puts to be assigned or just to continue to roll them until they're profitable to where I want them to be and just buy the shares out right. Either of those scenarios are completely fine. Dylan says, great thought about the adjustment down per assignment being at the",

Yeah, that's again, but mine, if you have any questions on what I'm talking about, please ask me, because that's genuinely the whole purpose of me running this strategy in this stock is because I want to help you learn how this can be used if it's something that fits or even tangentially. It's what you're doing more more broadly. Now, one thing to note on the short call side of things, and this is absolutely worth noting. First thing, you can see that the short calls have actually been providing a bit of relief for the broader trade. There's 471 made on the short calls, which again, it's not a lot of money. But if you take this total short call collection by the total basis that we have, the stock is been objectively going down. And on the invested capital that's in GameStop right now, these have made 1.9 return. Again, that's not like, oh, wow, making huge bank here, obviously not. But this is doing much better than if I'm just holding the underlying in that scenario. This is absolutely crushing it on a comparative basis. And it's",

And it's because of these small little efficiencies we gain from the satellite positions via the options. But right now, the danger I have is on this side, which you need to see. And this gets into a much more advanced method of trading, which is, if you take a look at the strike price relative to my basis for the short call. My basis is 2821. The strike price as things sit right now is at just 21. So the problem is if I get assigned, I'm essentially taking a 7 loss, which is pretty much catastrophic. That would be really, really bad. So this short call that I have on is actually going to have to be very actively monitored and managed. The way that I do this is simple. I set up, typically, a bunch of different alerts. And I also don't think it's at 21, one sec. Let me actually figure out where it is because I wouldn't have sold it below current price either. That's obviously a typo. Give me one sec.

And what I'm doing here is keeping a really light number of short calls, because again, we never know when GameStop is gonna pop. And I probably will scale this up. Now that GameStop is kind of stabilizing. And I'll probably sell two so that I have two short calls against the 250 shares. And this is what the intention of managing those short calls if they fell on the money. But except in the fact that if there is a squeeze of some sort, there's a really good chance that they would get assigned early and take the shares, which is okay. That generally would still be a fairly profitable position for me. So that's the position as it sits. This number is messed up. It's obviously pulling it from a random spot.

It was pulling all of this stuff. So anyways, that is the covered, stringled trade as it sits right now in GameStop. We are 74 utilized. So about 15 left to go. We need 18,500 to cash secure everything I have out as it sits. That includes cash secured puts and the long equity. The majority of the position right now for the cash secured element is from the cash secured put side of things. The primary reason for that realistically is because it's going down. So when the stock is going down like this, I don't want to hold the equity. It's because it's going the wrong way. Now for GameStop, I also, and generally the coverage triangle, I don't like unwinding the equity. If it's going down, the times I'll do that is if I'm trading the coverage triangle on a leveraged ETF, if you're following the other stuff I do, you will have seen me do that in T-Triple Cues, but that's because it's three times leveraged.

Otherwise, let's get into the DD library. Before the DD library, I want to show you this study so that you can look it up at your leisure. Really, whenever you have a little time to read through this stuff, I think it's useful in understanding the broader market. This not only talks about GameStop, but it talks about the broader condition of things like seller boxing, which I believe is highly relevant to GameStop. I think, as most people probably guess, I think that that's one of the dominant things that we started seeing in the beginning of why GameStop was being targeted the way it was. I definitely think that there's a pretty important element of GameStop in here, but it talks about these other effects as well more broadly.

It's not just GameStop that demonstrates short squeezes, gamma squeezes, and things like that that are heavily, heavily monetizable. So that's really what this study is about. It's pretty interesting. It's honestly not the most well done that I've seen, but it does a good job tying together some of the themes that you're used to seeing in terms of excessive short interest in terms of seeing synthetic locates and deliveries even via deep in the money long calls, those kinds of things. So I think it's probably checking out. But we left off on my boy Dave Lauer. And this is actually funny because I did a podcast with Dave Lauer and Irvin Finance.

Want to put together a post to clarify some things about how they operate, what they do and what they cannot do. This is super important because you've also heard me talk about this a lot.

This distinction massively important to understand at the highest level. OTC and internalization of orders is very different than this. Let's continue. To understand dark pools, what makes them different from exchanges need to understand regulatory nuances and market data characteristics. It's easier to get approval for a dark pool regulated by Fennred than an exchange regulated by SEC comparatively. This is on purpose. The ATS is there's supposed to be a way to foster competition and innovation, unfortunately, that is resulted in 40 plus dark pools and extreme off exchange fragmentation. And this is also why for the first time in a long time, you actually see off exchange volume broadly exceeding on exchange volume. That's crazy. Anyways, most dark pools are ostensibly to allow institutional asset managers to post large orders that they do not want to be visible on in exchange. There are different reasons why they do not want these orders to be visible on exchange. And they're not all bad. One of the reasons is because if I am a pension fund, big mutual fund, whatever, and I want to unwind or let's say I want to buy 10 million dollars of Apple stock from UBS or somebody else.

I, if you don't mind, I want to keep it focused on game stop for now. And then after we get through this, if you remind me of your question at the end, happy to talk about it with you. Jerry says, I can't believe your boy PB got caught being a private equity plant, your boy Tom Sawsnaf from Motley Fool, still shorting Jimmy. I didn't know that about PB in terms of being a private equity plant, not sure what that is to be honest. And Tom Sawsnaf, I don't know the Motley Fool comment there. Tom Sawsnaf is from Tasty, they have like their own, their own brokerage. So what do you mean from Motley Fool? Oh, maybe you're using it as like a joke saying like Motley Fool. I don't know because in case you don't know, Motley Fool is actually a firm. They do like research. I don't know if you know that. But Tom's not part of Motley Fool, at least as far as I know. These guys. Are you confusing people? Are you confusing Tom Sawsnaf with Tom Gardner? Is that it? Yeah. Age says the PB thing is some GME ex account talking shit slash rage baiting. Oh, so it's not.

He's going to be on the podcast again soon. But PB, I met him pretty recently. But we do talk, but he never mentioned anything like that. So I'm not sure. I'm not sure the details on it. If you have what the post is or whatever, I'm happy to take a look at it. Okay. So here it says this is the fundamental difference between dark pools and exchanges. No orders are visible on dark pools. Hence dark where you have some where you can have visible orders on exchanges. Now you can also have hidden orders on exchanges. Absolutely iceberg orders and things like that. And there's nothing preventing in ATS from posting quotes. Bloomberg used to do this all the time. However, generally speaking today, there aren't dark pools that show any posted orders. So what about the trades?",

Bloomberg used to do this all the time. However, generally speaking today, there aren't dark pools that show any posted orders. So what about the trades? All trades in the national market system have to be printed to a sip feed. It does not matter where they happen. This is super important. And all trades during regular hours 0 9 30 to 1600. That's eastern time. Must be within the N BB. Oh, these are hard and fast rules cannot be violated. All trades on exchanges are reported to the regular sip, which is essentially like the the consolidated tape. That's orders that go through the dark pool are still going to hit the consolidated tape. All trades, all trades that happen off exchange ATS or OTC are reported to the trade reporting facility TRF run by NYC NASDAQ or FINRA. All trades have to be reported to the TRF within 10 seconds. So this is the consolidated tape element of being executed. Though the reality is that they're reported nearly instantaneously. So the delay is much less than that. This gives you a chart of the reporting requirements and timelines. There's a question on Fox and Twitter yesterday. Can hedge funds go short in dark pools and not need to report it?

But such a statement is nonsensical. It's not how dark pools work. Yeah. So I don't know the tweet that Dave's referring to, but that's honestly just a function of when you do this a lot, I noticed myself not always always having the the major patience that I would want to have with people. But you do start to answer a lot of a lot of the same things over and over again. And Dave is a great guy. And I think he does his best as well. But we're all human, right? It's kind of like like that question stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of dark pools. And sometimes when people again, I don't know this instance, but for context, sometimes when people postulate things, they postulate it in the context of like, this is what's happening versus asking like, is this what's happening? So what I mean by that is again, I don't know the post he's referring to, but a lot of times people will say things like hedge funds, hedge funds can go short in dark pools and they don't need to report it,",

But anyways, I just identify with Dave here and Dave is such a nice guy that I want to defend him a little bit because I don't think, well, at least I hope people don't think he's flipping. He's definitely not. There is practically no difference at all between trades executed on exchange or off exchange, especially when you're talking about reporting, short positions or short sale marking. The rules are identical regardless. Short sale marking is not dependent on whether you trade on or off exchange, not trying to make a statement as to whether firms are doing it adequately or accurately, which is exactly correct. There's a difference in reporting which we do know that a lot of places do not report effectively. And a lot of places just kind of willingly accept the penalty for not reporting effectively. I also have never heard of this idea that firms will choose whether to execute on or off exchange based on where they want buying pressure or selling pressure to show up.

Every time a trade happens at the ask or near it, they characterize that as a buy. Every time happens near a bid, characterize it as a sell. You cannot hide what you were doing in dark pools or through OTC internalization. It cannot be done. All trades are public and reported within 10 seconds. That's correct. Yeah. Here's what I think was trying to be said. If trades are taking place OTC, such as orders that are being internalized, this is exactly where things get more interesting. By sitting at L over to both of those firms qualifies market makers. Market makers do have an exemption for short selling. They are allowed to do so without having to locate the shares first. This gets into naked shorting and things like that. I'm just trying to help you understand that dark pools are not nefarious and that there's very little difference between dark pools and exchanges from trading position marking. Yeah, I agree.

    "text": "pools are not nefarious and that there's very little difference between dark pools and exchanges from trading position marking. Yeah, I agree. Can you use dark pools and off exchange trading to artificially hold on the price of a stock? I struggled to see the mechanism by which this can be done. Never heard of it other than here. As I've said several times, every trade needs to be reported, every single trade that buys GME reported to the tape. There's no hiding that. The only market manipulation I've ever studied or measured has been the subject enforcement action by the SEC has been on exchanges that is done with layering and spoofing, which is actually a massive problem yeah. So I actually think this is good and he does also dive into the fact that and we talked about this actually earlier before we even got to this, which is way too much off exchange trading. Ben says there are transactions that do not have to be reported to the consolidated tape. It depends on the transaction. If an order isn't internalized, it doesn't, but other than that, it's going to have to consolidate a tape if it goes through a dark pool. That's that's the whole point. So yeah, it depends on your understanding of what other kind of transactions you're talking about. But if something is internalized, that's the main issue with internalized orders is that they don't hit the consolidated tape. That's the contention. Okay, that",

I actually like that one a whole lot. Also just because I like Dave, but okay, let's take a look at one more. I'm going to go grab a drink and feed Thor real quick. So it'll probably be like less than two minutes. All right. How do we do? Also, Thor is very thankful, by the way, because Homi was super hungry. So thank you guys for hanging in there for a second. We come back with a coconut pineapple, seltzer water, which is actually quite good. H says the PB thing is some GME X account talk. The subject is that PB worked in FinTech in post about other topics than GME PB posted a rebuttal to address it. I mean, yeah, I guess I don't see any issue with that. I don't understand any issue with like people talking about stuff other than GameStop. I don't think, and I also don't think that there's anything wrong with people working in industry. Dave Lauer worked in industry. Like, I don't know why people try to use that is like ammunition to tear down people that are actually trying to help shed light on the broader thing.",

Funny enough timing that this is the next thing that we pop up is by PB. I feel like it would be much smarter for folks to evaluate people based on what they say. And like, you can assess if people are genuine or not. Because like, I don't actually get the issue. So Jerry, maybe you can help me with that because it sounds like you're one of those people that might have an issue with it. And then Jerry says, oh, you're right. Tom Sawznaf, not from Motley Fool, but he did short GameStop and is tied to Apex clearing from TD. We all know Apex and TD Ameritrade did to GME even worse. I don't know about the context with TD Ameritrade, but he's never he's never shorted GameStop. He Tom Sawznaf trades options. He's sold calls on GameStop. He's never shorted GameStop. It's different. I'm selling calls in GameStop right now against long shares that I have. So again, I'm not sure like what the what the desire is to like, like what's that outcome there? Right?

So for those that don't know, one of the things I noticed about PB is that he's very into liquidity and market provision. So that's what I'm assuming a lot of this is going to be about. Does this have a date for all 21? The real issue is much worse. Signs that the entire banking system is straining under the weight of massive liquidity injections from the Fed. Okay? Yes. Right?

Damn, I wish it would let me do that though. That's okay. We'll do five years. Let's see. Yeah, so we can actually see from the lens of what he was talking about is he's showing this decline that you see here. But it actually normalized and started expanding again. So if we look at this one more specifically, we go back 10 years. I think he had set to max. You can actually see it looks completely fine. Here's COVID down to here. And then from that point forward, it's actually been expanding again, which this doesn't surprise me right to see the follow through from the COVID issue. Stuff like that takes a little bit of time. So yeah, this is is this is unsurprising to me broadly. CD spreads. What is this commercial? Industrial loans, bank credit continuing to contract. So I think that's from the leads and lags of the system. Despite trillions being pumped into the economy, the economy is supposedly recovering. What's going on?

Yeah, I think I honestly think that's just leads and lags of the economic system. It takes time. Liabilities and capital liabilities. Let's see how that one is trending. And it widget. We want to add liabilities. Capital liabilities. Deposits US Treasury. Capital. General account Wednesday level. Okay. Let's add this. And we will need to have two. Two different access. Yeah, there we go. So right now it's combining the access and we want to. Let's find. So it's on the left axis. This should be on the right. Act. There we go.

Government didn't start drawing down. Yes. Absolutely. But we can see that again, like even here, it's recovered. So I think this is another artifact of just the leads and lags. That's mostly what I'm seeing. That ownership of treasury bonds, we already know that this is going down. Yeah, interesting. I like the piece.

In general, I think to even give you like an overview, one of the things to keep an eyeball on is, most of the says I was looking at this for long term, but got wrapped up in the big downfalls. So then if you're looking at it for the long term, then what's the issue? Because it's going down. I mean, you're trading a three times levered ETF. I don't know. I'm not really sure what your expectations were, but QQQ hasn't even gone down yet. What? Like 539 down to a low of 480. Let's see. 539 down to 480. 539 down to 480. It's a 10, so 11 drop. It's not even in a bear market yet. It's definitely crossed into a correction. No doubt there. But I get like that's kind of the the confusion, right?",

But I get like that's kind of the the confusion, right? It's like, I don't fully understand what you expected to happen here, but it sounds like you might have gone into this with maybe not doing your research on how the underlying itself might behave, and it sounds like that might have touched you down the wrong path. Most of the says it worries me that maybe I won't be able to recover when the market turns bullish again. I see. Yeah. So I mean, broadly, this just sounds like you got into something that you didn't research. So then in that instance, you kind of have to think through what you're comfortable with and what you want to happen from here. But that's absolutely the broad context of what this is, right? So then from there, it really comes down to how do you choose to proceed from here? Anytime a trader has something that they're uncomfortable with or didn't think through, I generally think that flattening and moving into something else that you research a little bit more is typically a better choice.

But what I can tell you from a broader context, though, for sure, is that what you're seeing right now is this is not bad. Like we're not at a point yet where this is a big, massive down move in the market. So if this is making you nervous, that's not good because it can get much worse. So one of the things I would recommend with anything before you get into it is especially like a leveraged ETF is this here. Just zoom out, right? And most of it says I did research, but I'd like some advice on how to protect further than just selling calls. There is no protection. You can try to offset some of your deltas by buying puts to create a floor to the downside, but that's going to be really expensive. The whole nature of the position as it sits is to put on risk and to take risk. So if you start putting out, hey, if you start putting on a bunch of long puts, you know, for a quote unquote, protection to the downside, then you essentially start effectively undoing the risk that you're taking. So it doesn't even make",

But it's if this is what you consider doing research, then I do think that there's a problem here, right? Because if we take a look at the move here, from here to here, this represents a 43 decline over 29 trading days of 43 decline. And so far, what we're seeing here is a 30 decline. So we're not even at anything commensurate with the recent down move, let alone in actually bad down move. Because again, these are just tied to corrections. These aren't tied to actual big market moves. This is a big market move. And here, T triple Q's dropped 82. So literally double what this is. And this is also one of the downsides of trading three times leverage ETF compared to stuff that's like two times leverage is that a three times leverage ETF like this, if you take a look at how long it took for this to get back to break even, it's actually kind of crazy.

    "text": "stuff that's like two times leverage is that a three times leverage ETF like this, if you take a look at how long it took for this to get back to break even, it's actually kind of crazy. Because if you take a look at the highs that it posted here, this was back on 22 November of 21, it literally poked its head above it on 16d 24 and then it still hasn't been back to it. So effectively, this still has not been back above all time highs in T triple Q's. This is the exact nature of trading a leverage ETF. You kind of have to be prepared for the moves. And then you have to have a game plan for them like the way that I trade because I'm trading a covered strangle right now in T triple Q's. But the way that I manage it is very similar to the way that I manage the covered strangle that I explained earlier in GameStop, which is as the underlying is going down, I'm unwinding my position slowly into it to capture profit, to lock in profit and to reduce downside exposure while simultaneously moving more and more into cash secured puts so that I have a floating and adjustable cost basis is when you buy the underlying whatever at whatever price your cost basis is now fixed, whatever that's at.

But literally what I just told you is exactly how. So what I do is that process. So right now as I look at my T triple Q's position that's in the covered strangle, I am sitting at 62 total utilization of how much money I've allocated to the position. 17 of that is in the equity, meaning holding shares outright. 44 of that 62 is in cash secured puts. And that's to give me the ability to adjust and move my basis around because when we're hovering near all time highs, I don't like being highly invested, especially in something like a three times leverage ETF because the risk becomes increasingly pronounced. So that's exactly how I'm managing it by keeping the account really carefully positioned as things sit now. So Moses, for you, I think what would make a lot of sense is if you take some time and like carefully think through your opinion of cues, T triple Q's, the market is it sits now and then deciding if the position reflects something that you're comfortable with what you want and",

But yeah, definitely wish you the best. The thing to keep in mind is that three times leveraged ETFs can be that they can move nasty, right? Like this is literally an 82 decline and this is during a moderate bear market. If you look at 2022 as a bear market in the SP 500, the market was down 19 in 22. The market was down 19.4. Like that is a objectively light bear market. And this is the move that you saw on cues in T triple Q's. If T triple Q was around during like the dot com bubble, the it probably would have gone insolvent. The move here is another 73 down move. So I mean, literally the way to look at T triple Q's is within the last five years, it's had 270 plus down moves, which is something to keep in mind.

I actually don't even view it as really offsetting the risk that much because it doesn't like if you're trading covered calls or ratio covered calls, the short call element doesn't effectively help us that much. It helps a little bit. The risk that you take from the long stock position is much greater than what you offset from the short calls because of the uncapped downside versus capped profit potential of the short calls. They don't pace one another. And then the short puts is actually increasing the risk because if I sell puts, I increase my downside exposure again, unlimited risk technically down to zero on the downside. So yeah, the main way you manage risk in something like trading a leveraged ETF like this is through sizing. How much do you use of the account? Because again, if I refer you back to the position that I have on right now, it's 62 utilized. And I'm 62 utilized with T-Triple Q's 30 off of term highs, right?

Coffee Donuts says, did you get your trading license? What do you mean by trading license? Do you mean like a series certification or do you mean like what does that mean trading license there technically isn't a license? There's different certifications depending on what you're trying to do like if you go through a series six, series seven, series 63. But those are really for financial advisors to be licensed to do different kinds of broader financial activities. So if you mean from that sense, no, I don't have any serious license.

Because I'm a I'm a fucking degenerate retail trader. Don't need anything, which is crazy if you think about it. It's absolutely insane that you can effectively do what we do with no no licensing at all. But yeah. But I'm not sure if you're referring to like any other kind of licensing, but I have a driver's license. Is that count? Ben says you have to pay more for everything if you get certain licenses. Well, it's not just about what you have to pay. It's again, it's about like the purpose of it because there's also restrictions that on what you can and cannot do. So like that it's yeah, it adds a lot of nuances to what you're doing in order to maintain the license. Moses says, what are you looking for when rolling puts? What are some key points you check before rolling? I have several videos that will break that down for you in detail. So there's this one. Moses, this one is for you. And then this one is for you. And then I'll give you like an overview of those, but those two videos will go much further into detail. Essentially, when I'm rolling options, I'm analyzing what the position is today.

Essentially, when I'm rolling options, I'm analyzing what the position is today. And then what the market is doing and what the portfolio is doing. And then I figure out what kind of adjustment for the short puts makes the most sense. Now to use the recent moves in T triple Q's as an example, I'm really focusing on the basis adjustment. Meaning again, like I went from the 78 strike down to the 75. And the reason for that is I'm favoring trying to decrease the cost basis on the short puts in the event that I get assigned is effectively as I can. And that's really designed to decrease the total risk, right? Because I can buy more units of T triple Q's if I'm buying it at 75 versus 78 and so on and so forth. So with something like T triple Q's, the whole point of the short puts is really to capture variance risk premiums. I'm really not planning to get assigned on them most of the time. So the rolling is really done to aggressively manage the basis to get me out of the trade faster. Ben says at 62. I thought of it does go 80 more down. 38 would not be enough leftover. But I forgot you could roll. It's still plenty leftover. It's not it's not going",

But let's say for example, let's just do a little bit of scratch math super fast. And then I got a bounce. But if we take a look at this, let's just go into here. I don't know what all this is. We'll just get rid of it. And let's say we have 100,000. And then I said, what what am I using 62 something like that 62 and what did I say the basis was 71? 71 60 or something like that. So this times this equals this divided by this. That's how many shares that would represent using a sample 100,000. So then this is how much is left. That represents 38,000. Let's say T triple Qs does go down another 80 from where it is now. And let's say that it's trading at like 12 and just kind of spitballing. So this divided by this is 3,166 shares.

So in the scenario that you're outlining Ben, what essentially would happen is this would decrease my cost basis from 71 60 in this scenario down to 25. So then as the stock is trading around 12, you can still sell short calls at least close to your basis. And then you require obviously a much lower recovery move before you can get out out of profit.
