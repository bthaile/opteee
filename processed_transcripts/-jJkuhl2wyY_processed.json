On the agenda is going to be kind of a quick conversational quiz and then after our conversational quiz, I want to take a look at some case studies. But the conversation today is very open and did. This is kind of our first departure from a regimented series of topics, right? So this is part 11, episode 11, whatever we want to call it. Number 11. So I'm using this as a bit of a gauge to see where we're at. How people are feeling about options to kind of see where we're sitting. Because then I'm going to make another piece of curriculum for us that will go on, essentially for another nine episodes beyond this. So the way I'm looking at it is like the first 10 episodes we've done have been really designed to lay the foundation for the rest of this. And then my intention is going forward. I want us to continue building off of what we've learned so far. And then for newer traders that are just joining us in the series, you can essentially go back into what we've covered so far. And then you know, get kind of caught up with where we're at now and then go from there. So that's what I'm thinking today. And then for everybody's awareness tomorrow is going to be a GME live stream at 5 p.m. Pacific time. So we'll",

Now in the meantime, while we're waiting for a couple of folks to trickle their way in, I have a couple more pictures from Alaska. I thought I would show you guys because I recently went on a trip there, flew the drone, had a bunch of fun. And so I'll kind of flip through some of these. I don't know which ones I showed you already and which ones I didn't. But I'll kind of like I said, I'll just blast through some of these so that you can kind of check out some of what we saw because we were kind of stunned by what we saw. This is all this big giant glacier area that we were hanging around and this is kind of like this trail that takes you up to this glacier. So there's a giant big ice field, essentially on the other side of this, which is really cool. And then if you guys haven't seen before, that's a close up of what it looks like kind of top down on a glacier, which I find the textures absolutely fascinating, which is",

But I like that one a lot. And then I will show you guys this last one. I don't know if you've seen it, but that one I just thought was super cool. We just have this bald eagle, let net rip. And with this just super cool backdrop. So yeah, a couple photos for you guys. The the trip is overall sick. I do have a video of some of the helicopter ride that we went on. If you are ever interested in checking that out. But that's what I got for us so far. All right, gang. So let's get into the option side of the house first. We got to say hello to everybody.

And I have some short calls against my long shares. But that's it. I don't have any directional GME options on right now. The way that I think about trading options is I need to move in and I don't put on directional options. You know, like buying long calls or kind of my standard go to sweet of strategies. And it's because they won't make money. I need to stock to move. And it's not moving right now. So the way that I think about that is as I see volume starting to come in. A little bit more meaningfully, then I'll happily start to trade it more speculatively, but I also wouldn't trade it before earnings at this point. Unless I wanted to trade it through earnings, which I don't have a good fingerprint for GME through earnings. It looks okay. Actually, I don't hate this through earnings. And then the times that it be big drop down. Yeah, like I don't hate this for earnings. So there might be an earnings play on the docket for GME. TBD.",

I can pull some of the questions. These are all random questions that I've generated over time and different things. I'm going to grab a couple from here, but then I really want to spend time going through the platform. I'm going to be talking about things specific questions in here.

That's what you see in the background there. All right. Any other answers? We got too so far. Any, well, I guess I could phrase it this way. Are there any other answers meaning anything different than these? Liz also says D. Cool. So for anybody that didn't answer, so anybody that is not. Recess Tom Liz or Paula.

For anybody that is not them. Ah, perfect. I'll find. So there we go. We always have to find one of them. So if Fondo is a brave answer, going against the crowd, I respect that. In this case, it was a terrible time to go against the crowd because you're 100 wrong. So let's focus on you, obviously. So I'll Fondo walk me through why you think it's A. And then simultaneously, John, the question is on the screen. If you're driving or something, I'll read it out again. The question is, in investor buys 10 of the XYZ may 70 calls for 3.10 3.1 when XYZ is at 68. At expiration, the stock is at 77 and the trader closes the position at intrinsic value. What's the PL? So in case those were wondering, this is an a question. Even that I made up on my own, a lot of the questions that I like to grab are from like a Series 7 licensing exam, actual like legitimate exams so that you can see the kind of stuff that goes into that, which is hilarious, right? Because if you think from an option of trading perspective, that this is what we're obviously have to know this. So maybe it's like comic books, it's super basic, but this is",

The content is invaluable so much more to learn, but certainly believe the possible to win consistently. That's awesome. First of all, congratulations. The second thing is I would highly encourage you to not worry so much about winning consistently, but winning long term. But yeah, that's awesome. I'm really, really stoked that your question at this huge. Ramalama says answer is D that is also correct. So Alfonzo is now doing the math. So if the stock is at 77 here, I guess you need another color to make that easier to see on sex. Stand by. So the stock is at 77. We have a strike at 70. We're essentially saying we're only looking at intrinsic value. It's giving you exactly what we care about. Intrinsic value. So we don't care about extrinsic value. So intrinsic value is Spanish for how far in the money. These are the same. So if we have our strike at 70, strike to 70, stock is 77. How far in the money is the call?

Is that I don't know never mind because you don't know why or do you still think that those should be integrated, but you're just not sure why they're not. Because if you're if you understand why they're not integrated, then I'll move on. But if you're not sure why they're not integrated, then I'd like to continue the point to make sure you get it. No, it was a bad question. No, it's like literally I'll tell you if it's a bad question. I because there are bad questions, but bad questions are relative to kind of the person who's asking them. So if you're new to options and that's a question you have, that's literally not a bad question at all. Like that's a completely fair question to ask. Yeah, so I'm in a similar boat as Sposcar. Like, well, I disagree. I think there's tons of bad questions, but I think that the bad question, again, like a question is relative to the person who's asking. So if there's somebody that's new to something like a beginner, you really have is about a wide leeway gap as you can imagine for asking questions.

One because I know I'm personally, but two because he is more or less been around markets for a while. So if he asked a question about something that I don't think he's reasonable for him to know about, meaning like, what's the disparity between stock XYZ and when we're plotting it's log normal distribution. Explain why cartosis is actually a bad indicator for us to assimilate into a pricing model. Like, I actually wouldn't expect Tom A to know that. So that's a fair question for his level.

So it's clear of all utility. You can grab a screenshot of this. So the reason for Carlos that was wondering about the Greeks, the Greeks just measure things. That's it. So Greeks are slave to options, not the other way around. So that's why the simple answer to that why don't we consider the Greeks in that piano calculation is because they literally don't matter. We're at expiration and something calculating what essentially we paid versus what it's worth. These don't have a say in that. And then the other one you guys can grab a screenshot of is this one, which is kind of like the, you know, the more comprehensive I have a YouTube video all about the Greeks. So I'll also grab that super fast for you in case you're looking to get into detail on the Greeks. There you go. And yeah, that that should get you a little more familiar, but",

So this is more of a general market understanding. The reason why I think this one is still relevant to us is because we need to understand these relationships.

That's what's dangerous to me. So then out of C or D, which of those benefits me if the yen value goes up, which is the scenario that causes me damage. A of trade says calls on yen would hedge.

Will he says don't understand totally cool. So let's let's try and let me see if I can help elucidate the point. Gravitarius says was the reasoning I had correct. I don't remember what your reasoning was. To be honest, if you repaste it, let me know. Evan flow also is unsure and same as Reese. That's cool. Yeah. So let's let's get it. Let's get this down. So pretend it's not 10 million. One of the easiest things you can do to help yourself kind of answer questions like this is just reduce all of the stuff down to its simplest terms.

In this example, again goes down. So then your one US dollar now can buy you two yen. Do these two scenarios make sense so far for you, Willie? So what I'm highlighting is there's a scenario where the yen, the value of the yen relative to the dollar goes up. Okay, cool. So now, if originally my original guess was I wanted to pay one dollar for something. In this scenario, this one dollar doesn't go as far. So if I was going to buy one dollar and that gives me 10 widgets, let's say just to add another number. 10 widgets, 10 things. That's what I was originally expecting to get.

But the addition with these long calls means I might make a dollar as the yen goes up. So then that gives me the two dollars I need without having to put more money out of pocket to cover this variance. Now for everybody else that's following along, this is a highly simplified example of what this actually, how this actually works. Just to be abundantly clear. However, the part that I'm trying to express to you, a, suppose car says, wouldn't you want to see if the calls cost more than the potential of USD to pay? That starts to get into the theoretical positioning of things. Because again, the purpose of the calls is to offset risk. It's not because we're trying to bank if the yen goes up. We simply want to make sure that we're going to be able to get our 10 widgets without having to add more than 10 million USD from our initial outlay. So the purpose of the",

We simply want to make sure that we're going to be able to get our 10 widgets without having to add more than 10 million USD from our initial outlay. So the purpose of the calls in this case, do you, to structure the trade again, they probably would use futures like it would be completely different than this. But in the theoretical scenario, the idea is if you buy calls on the yen, you make money on the calls that then offset the additional rise in price in the devaluation of the dollar. Well, he says, I see your point of appreciate taking the time to explain. Yeah, definitely. So, the funds are says, borrow 10 million yen when you make the deal and pay it back in the end when you pay the supplier. Yep. So there's obviously other ways to hedge the position. Again, you just take the question for what it is. It's just teaching about the concept of using options to hedge. You can change this from currencies to something else. You can change it to a forward. It's just the concept that you should pay attention to here. More importantly, the other takeaway that you should have from this is when we're using options around other things. That's the main point.

That's the main point. Evan Flow says, I see that now because we're protecting our deal in the future, but we don't want to pay more than the agreed upon price. Yep. The calls are insurance to protect our future price fluctuations. That's exactly right. Yep. That's exactly correct. And the broader idea here is some people when I've given this question before they're like, well, why don't you just pay them today? Well, why would I pay them today? If I don't have to pay them for six months, why would I give up six months of interest and pay them today? This makes no sense. So while if I paid them today, it would absolutely lock in the value. If I can put this 10 million into some sort of interest bearing account that I can then use to subsidize the cost of in this example, long calls, now essentially I have a hedge that subsidize via my original principle. So again, it's just a general example designed to help connect a couple dots. It's not a practical example of how this actually would work. This is not how it would go. But this is how it goes.

So, that's what term structure is in this case. Now, there's other things that you can add to this. So, this is more of a volatility surface, which there are different versions of that. I don't know if I have one of those in here, do I? Hmm, I don't think so. Yeah, I don't. So, let me add that to my deduolis, actually. So, I'll add like, volatility term structure and surface.

So, I'll add like, volatility term structure and surface. I'll add that into the deck for us. But, without that, this is just a way to visualize volatility over different time periods. It's why we care about it, because our ability to understand volatility over different time periods can tell us where it's expensive on a relative basis, where it's cheap on a relative basis.

That's what this is showing you. So, this is a smile, but it's not always a smile. So, sometimes it will be a different shape like you see here. This is like a fucked up smile. This is a silly smile.

Now, you have to be really, this starts getting into the weeds, and I don't want to start going over people's heads here. So, I'm going to gloss over this. I'm happy to go further into detail on this if anybody would like in the future. I just don't want to overwhelm people. Because this starts to get a little convoluted. Because what you'll almost always notice is the far out of the money options are going to have really high walls priced in. And they tend to be really expensive for what they are. That's a function of pricing models and the way market makers perceive their risk. I'll kind of leave that at that. So, when we see skew, we can't immediately assume like right across the bat, that if we see the call side higher than the put side that that automatically thinks we think it's going up.

So, if I go to, well, it's 22 technically. So, I have to be a little more precise than that. So, if it's 22, and I want to go plus or minus 10 points, I can look at what the wall is at 32, and then I can take a look at what the wall is at 12. So, if I go to 32, my wall is like 113 for this front expiration. If I go to 12, my wall in this case is like 95. So, I can tell you that the calls are being priced with more walls than the puts, which is actually kind of backwards than what you typically would see. You generally see the put side price heavier. So, in this case, the market is pricing in more volatility, expected movement to the upside. It's exactly what it's telling me.

I can sometimes tell if it's kind of just a floating order of us. I wouldn't call it a spoof. That's more of a high frequency trading. But market makers, to go a little further down the rabbit hole, they don't always show the current actual expected volatility for something, because then it shows their cards. So, a lot of times they'll rest, walls that aren't accurate. And then if somebody starts entering the market, they'll then adjust their walls to be more accurate.

That's exactly what that's pricing. Great discussion. And I'm always happy to talk about all. I think it's super important. Re says that calls skew is from the market makers hedging and not from retail buying excessive calls or one in the same. It's where they're pricing markets. So it's not from market makers hedging and it's not necessarily from retail buying excessive calls. Market makers decide they they're of a quote machine. So think of it this way. If I'm a market maker for a game stop, I need to determine what I want to price these at. So these these 40 calls. What do I want to price these at? How do I determine that? The way that they determine that is that they they're just looking at volatility. That's the game. So they're figuring out what they're best guess. What they think what volatility makes sense for the product. And that's one of the cool parts about efficient markets because if I'm a market maker, the way I make money is by making markets is by gaining transactions. Cool. Now, if I make a",

And that's one of the cool parts about efficient markets because if I'm a market maker, the way I make money is by making markets is by gaining transactions. Cool. Now, if I make a market and the question might be, well, then why wouldn't they just always over estimate their volatility? That would definitely pad them better. It would make options more expensive and it would give them a better pad. However, markets are competitive. So if I'm padding my order too much and I'm pricing this right now, it's running at 139.39 of all. And I want to be super conservative. So I want to pad the balls make them higher so that I have more room to work with if my ball estimate is wrong. But there's other people. And if there's other balls that are more accurate, they're going to undercut you and then you're not going to get the volume. So that's one of the cool things about efficient markets is that market makers are really pushed to be more accurate in their calculations. The other thing that people don't fully appreciate is that individual market makers, their first job is to make markets. Their second job is to control their risk. So there's nothing that says I is the market maker must price these options at the best possible theoretical value. If I already have a portfolio and based",

We don't want to give them the ability to turn their shit on when they want to make money and then turn it off and they're like, okay, I'm good. I've made my money. That creates an incentive essentially for them to start trading directionally. We don't want that. So yeah, a little bit of a rabbit hole, but I think it's an important one for people to understand because I genuinely believe market makers are probably one of the more misunderstood entities that play in this whole ecosystem with us. At least that's my opinion. Any thoughts or questions on that? What do you say? How do you put in different walls? They decide. So they again, like they literally have a quote machine. So they'll have a volatility surface that estimates whatever they think volatility should be.

So this is a prime example of another way that market makers can skew what they're giving you. They can say, I'm tired of selling calls. I don't want to sell anymore calls. So in this case, I'm going to give you one call at 57. But if you want to buy them, I got a shit ton for you boss. Come on in. I have 314 locked and loaded to go at the 60.

And then historic volatility is what has happened in the past. It's exactly correct. Now to confound things a little bit, there's kind of a world called realized volatility.

    "text": "happened in the past. It's exactly correct. Now to confound things a little bit, there's kind of a world called realized volatility. And realized volatility is really interesting. I'm not going to go super far into detail in this because I think there's a pretty solid chance that it's going to freak a lot of people out. So what I will do though is share a link with you on a video that goes into volatility. So that it's a little more clear because you can have forecast volatility. You can have realized volatility. You can have future realized volatility. It can get a little confusing to that end. So we'll save that joy and wonder as experience for another time. So that's good. You guys got that down. Cool. So now I thought what we could do is pivot and take a look at a couple case studies. But this is also a perfect time. Whatever questions you have start throwing them in because I probably have maybe another 15 minutes or so. And I would love to hit as much stuff as I can with you guys. Gravitary says you have videos on how to find incorrectly bargain price options. There's not really a way to do that. I mean, realistically speaking, like the probability of you as a retail trader finding a mispriced option is almost null. It's not zero, but the way you have to do that then is you have to find something where you",

It's not zero, but the way you have to do that then is you have to find something where you think your volatility is priced better than the market volatility, which is real tricky because again, I told you when we look at market participants, especially institutions, they're really smart. And most of the larger institutions have derivatives desks and market makers and pro firms. There's a lot of very serious committed traders to the markets where if you're trading options markets, a big part of your job is pricing volatility. The concept of finding incorrectly priced options is predicated on somebody mispricing volatility. So unless you think you can price volatility better than market consensus, there's not really a way. So we just have to try and ride the waves while the whales are making sort of to agree, like there's other things you can do though. So like for example, this kink right here in game stop, where I can see that this option here, which is what the 17 and a half is much higher than the 17s. So I could come up with a relative value play. I could say I think the 17 walls are going to go up and I think the 17 half walls are going to go down. And I can trade",

I could say I think the 17 walls are going to go up and I think the 17 half walls are going to go down. And I can trade that relationship normalizing and there can be reasons why there's these kinks that emerge. But again, that's not so much attempting to trade what we would perceive as a mispricing, but a relative pricing difference. And there's typically reasons why it exists. It's not risk free. If you put on that trade that does not mean that the 17 walls are going to go up and that the 17 and a half walls are going to go down. But it just means that I think these are out of line and maybe I can run a play on it. And you can do that within the same expiration cycle. You could do that across expiration cycles. So in this case if I throw on the 18 oct. I can see periods where they're inverted. So like here I can see these 22s are actually more they have more vault in 18 oct and less in 20. So in this case I can buy the 20s in the cheaper and sell the 20 22s in the more expensive and I can trade a calendar in that sense to trade their relative vaults between one another.

All of a sudden, could you talk about order types how to get the best possible fills yeah the way you get the best possible fill is definitely through a market order kidding. Okay, so you guys I just realized how serious that sounded. And I didn't smile but definitely not through a market order. So the reason why market orders are really terrible is because it really focuses on speed of transaction as compared to getting best price. So market order is essentially I want to get executed for whatever it is right now. So if I look at this 23 and it's bid 148 offered 160 and I just want to get a fill right now. Right this second rather than using a limit order I would use a market order and that's just going to do it at the very next available transaction. That's a dangerous order. I have a great example of how it's dangerous today I was trading zero DTE SPX options they were in profit. So I had a stop market order. So in this case if you do just a regular stop you'll see that essentially once an option gets to a certain price it turns into a market",

So I had a stop set hit my stop and then I got the next fill that was two times what the stop was which is terrible. It's a terrible fill but you have to understand and prioritize what your objective is because some people will say oh I want to do a stop limit. So if I look at a stop limit that means once my trigger is hit in this case 160 I can say well I want to get filled at no worse than 170. Well what if it goes past 170 then what then you have a problem you didn't get a fill. So this stop that is supposed to protect your risk from blowing out you didn't get a fill. So now you wanted to get out at 160 it gaped past 160 it already went past 170 which is where your limit was and now it's at 190 then 2 then 2 10 to 60 that's 3 that 3 and a half it's at 4 this can happen in zero DTE this isn't even dramatic pricing you literally can have an option that goes from 50 cents to 10 dollars like that's not",

You know exactly what happened and it sucks it happens sometimes but I would rather control the risk and more often than not with zero DTE's it'll come right back in the range. The times that you'll get knocked out at those points is when they're typically is some sort of you know short term extreme that then reverses but it doesn't always.

Oh wait what I don't understand it's literally right here. We talk about. You mean on the Schwab platform because Schwab owns think or swim think or swim is Schwab. This is for options exactly what I'm showing you. This is a trailing stop limit where if. This wherever you choose to start it. Well let's do just a trailing stop standard. Yeah the platform yeah so because think or swim is owned by Schwab and you literally can do it right here. This is exactly what it shows you so based on wherever you're at now you can tell a plus or minus you can give it only one direction. You can do it off of a percentage you can do it off of like the plus or minus is a raw value but yeah you can absolutely use a trailing stop a trailing stop limit. For sure.
