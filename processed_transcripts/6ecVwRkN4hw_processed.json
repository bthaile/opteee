    "text": "boom we're back let's talk about scanning for trades because this should not be a halfhazard approach it should be pretty systematic and it's for a few main reasons but it all boils down to efficiency so I'm going to walk you through the three primary steps I take when I'm scanning for trades and then give you some examples at the end of the video so make sure you stay tuned to check those out welcome back to the outliers shout out to the patreon family you guys make content like this possible for everybody else and if what I do helps you consider signing up otherwise let's get straight into this idea of scanning for trades the very first thing we're going to start with is a portfolio review this is because you have to understand how something does or doesn't fit into your portfolio you can come across the greatest opportunity on planet Earth but if there's no room in your portfolio to logically take on that risk it doesn't have a place so we start here and we look at three things the first thing is utilization how much money am I currently using is it enough or is it too much what what I'm asking here is is it enough meaning do I have enough risk out in order to continue moving me towards my monthly and annual performance targets or after I conduct a review of my portfolio do I have too much risk",
