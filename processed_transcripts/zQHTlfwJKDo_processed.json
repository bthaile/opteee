I'm in the process of trying to copy a calculator, because I wanted to spend a little time actually analyzing some of the recent price movement in GameStop today. So it looks like the copy went all right. It's just going to take a hot minute for it to load because the document is pretty large. So we're going to take a couple minutes and talk about where GameStop is today, how things look, and then we'll continue down the path of this document here, which is analyzing the theories, planning the stream to be probably about half hour, something like that. And let's get right to it. Charlie, hope everybody is having an awesome weekend. And I still get the sense it feels like things are quiet from the ape community. It definitely feels like things have quieted down. I can kind of tell from a few different vectors. Obviously, the GameStop videos that I put out, they always provide a proxy for how many people are actively engaging in the stock. And then also, honestly, the number of emails that I get with people asked me to look at things, which is always actually very, very fun for me. But yeah, it seems pretty quiet. And it doesn't surprise me because I mean, if we think about it, GameStop has been essentially in a downtrend for two months now. So this",

And it doesn't surprise me because I mean, if we think about it, GameStop has been essentially in a downtrend for two months now. So this downtrend started, I'll show you after we had a bit of a peak here. We saw that in the beginning of January. Things were actually looking really good, really healthy. And then it's been slowly tailoring down from there. Now, I think the main question, at least in my mind, and probably everybody's mind is, where's the floor? Where does it actually seem like GameStop is likely to gain some traction? And we can see that that's sort of happening here. I can get rid of this value. I'll keep that value area for now, because I want to talk about it actually briefly. We can get rid of that one. And we still have this pretty well-defined descending channel. So as things sit today with GameStop, the stock itself has been sitting on really, really quiet circumstances. There's really not a lot of news coming out. There's not a lot of buzz about what they're doing. There's not a broad overarching narrative that I'm seeing pushed out currently about GameStop. There's definitely some glimpses that we've seen.

And the broader market itself is also struggling right now. So if we take a look at the broad market, and I just look at total performance, let me tell you right now, IWM small caps is down 3.7 year to date. Spy is up to 0.81. Q's is down 1.2. So in Bitcoin, Ibit, just add a curiosity is down 12.8. Bonds are up slightly, VIX is up slightly. The reason why I bother telling you these metrics is because it gives us a little bit of context around how the broader market is behaving right now, which is still part of what GameStop fits in, which is the broader market. And I continue to see a lot of different theories and ideas around the price movement. It seems like people are still very, very interested in trying to crack that code and I don't blame them. It's a very, very curious problem to try to analyze. But based on what I've seen so far, I still haven't seen any of these key theories panning out.

And that's simply because I'm not in here trying to prove my own theory. I don't really have one beyond the stuff that I've already talked to you all about with respect to price and volume. So the reason I say it's an advantage position is because it's always easy to look at other people's ideas and poke holes, but not give your own. And that's not really the aim of what I'm doing. I'm actively trying to see if I can identify any instances where it looks like there might be this broader underlying function that we may or may not be aware of or actively see. And in general, don't really see a lot of it to be completely honest with you. There are elements that I continue to see in terms of FTDs.

Now, I'm eager to continue going through the DD library with you all and see what pops up, what else might be in there. We have a lot to uncover still. But that's just kind of like where things sit as of now based on the, I mean, many hours that we've spent at this point, looking at the stuff together. Now, to take a look at GameStop itself, a couple of things really stuck out to me. The first thing that stuck out to me was the behavior in this value area here. Now, I originally would have anticipated a little stronger price activity in this range that simply didn't happen. And it's just because we can see that price has interacted with this general range several times before just kind of bouncing right through it. Now GameStop has been consolidating sideways for about four days straight. So a lot of people are now trying to figure out what is the actual price level that the market thinks GameStop deserves to sit at. And I think a",

So a lot of people are now trying to figure out what is the actual price level that the market thinks GameStop deserves to sit at. And I think a lot of that really is predicated on the market's perception of what Ryan Cohen might be thinking to do. And we simply don't know that yet. We know that they do have really strong positioning in terms of their cash. We've talked about that a million times. But the cash alone is not enough. You need more than just cash. It's a business. They're not a bank. They're not in the game of essentially borrowing from the federal government and then loaning out the money that they get from the federal government and capturing a spread like big banks can do. That's not what GameStop is. So while I will always reiterate the point, I see people talk about, oh, well, they're collecting interest on that money. They are collecting interest on the money. That's for sure. But again, that's not a viable business model. It's simply not. Now the latest that we've seen from Cohen does start to make me think that there is a potential for involvement in cryptocurrency. And I'll show you why.

So if we take a look at some of his general posts that we were looking through, right? So this came on the seventh of Feb. And we all know what sailor tends to embody, which is Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. And then if we take a look at his replies, there is this where the Strive asset management CEO essentially told Cohen that he should adopt Bitcoin as a reserve asset using the five billion. And then he responds, let it received. There's a reality here that the only reason why he would bother responding here is to fuel that general idea that GameStop might be getting involved in cryptocurrency. There's no other reason for him to respond to this other than that. This is essentially a way to make a public statement. Now, again, what that actually means, I really don't know, because even if GameStop gets involved into Bitcoin, that still isn't a business model. It's not. And for those that look at something like MicroStrategy, MicroStrategy is a completely different beast that is effectively a Ponzi scheme. Because using that convertible debt is soon as the stock price dips for some reason or another below some of those convertible rates, the price levels that they would be converted at, they now have a massive problem.

He knows more about that stuff than I do. There's no doubt in my mind about it. But there's also the reality of what these convertible debt, what these convertible securities are. And so anyways, I make that point clear because for people that are looking at MicroStrategy and saying, oh, Bitcoin can do what they do. It's a terrible idea. Sooner or later, MicroStrategy is going to reap what they sell. It's just a matter of how long and who makes enough money on other funds as they come in. I genuinely hope GameStop would not go that route because I still think that they have the potential to make a meaningful change in their business model, which is effectively what has to happen here. I think that that is the case. So that's the latest as far as I see it with GameStop. It's kind of not a whole lot new. Like that's really what that amounts to in my opinion.

So we still have a little ways to go before earnings will kick off for GameStop. I don't know if you guys agree with that. I don't know if you're seeing something different than what I'm seeing. But in general, that's kind of the broad opinion that I have. I think that there's a little bit of buzz around cryptocurrency. And I'm not saying I think it's bad if they got involved in cryptocurrency. I think it could be fine, depending on how much they use and what the game plan is. I'm not inherently against that. But I just don't I don't think that's enough. Like that's just a piece of a puzzle. But the company still has to be a company. Still has to be a business. And it still has to drive revenue.

That's a pretty big unwind of your assets, just because you're holding something that is incredibly volatile. So again, not against it at all. But I do think we have to look at it with not rose colored glasses and do our best as objective thinkers and to conclude what the impact could be of doing something like that. And if you do that with a meaningful part of their cash, right? So say they're sitting on five billion, say they put in three billion in a Bitcoin, you might be super stoked on that. Well, if they're actually going to try to use that five billion to reinvent the business to reinvest in itself, maybe to acquire a business and you're eyeballing something. And then you're expecting to be able to use that money to acquire a business.

Lauren says I don't see them buying crypto alone as a business strategy moving forward. That doesn't make sense to me, but Rc is up to something. I just have no idea what it is. I think that's fair. And I also think a lot of us absolutely hope Cohen is up to something. And right now it is based primarily on hope. Like let's again, also keep it, keep it a buck. There's nothing that we're seeing right now in terms of tangible information that lets us know that we are working on something or what we are working on.

So as time goes on, I do think the pressure starts to present itself a little bit more. Whereas it's like, okay, what is the actual plan? Because we have been sitting on this cash for a while and would like to see it materialized. But until that point, it's essentially a function of trust.

Apex says, if you wait a few weeks, he will likely get a great price for Bitcoin. You're absolutely correct, though, at some point a business model needs to arise. Yeah, well, and that's the thing, right? Is the nature of holding Bitcoin, I completely agree with you. Even if you started getting into Bitcoin now, I think over a long term timeframe, I think what you get Bitcoin for now is probably good, right? Like if we're talking a long enough time horizon, I think even if you top ticked it at 100,000 before the drop, if we're talking about a five year horizon, I still imagine that's probably a pretty good price compared to what it'll be at some point in the future. But exactly to reiterate that point, if you get it now at a great price, but then it takes five years for it to really show a return on that price even three years, that's a long time to hold the currency as a business and really not have a whole lot to show for it.

So I think even if it gets into Bitcoin, again, like that's cool, but unless they're going to do something to monetize the actual Bitcoin holdings, that point just holding a volatile asset, which is okay, right? Like there, again, there's nothing inherently wrong with it, but that's not a business model. That's just holding a volatile asset on the balance sheet until you decide what you want to do with the rest of the capital, which is what I think most of us, at least for me, like that's what I'm very keen to get a better understanding of. And I do believe when the time is appropriate, I do think we'll see it, right? I do think that he'll start communicating more around it. At least that's my hope. My last helium says, I hope he doesn't invest in Bitcoin. Yeah, and it definitely is a mixed bag, right? Like there are definitely people like that. I don't blame him because again, if one of the best things I saw in one of the videos is the one of my videos talking about this similar thing and it genuinely is my exact same opinion.

When you buy GameStop, you're buying a completely different business model than that. But Lauren says, I hope there's a bit more guidance next earnings, but he's not known for that. To be completely honest, I naively thought that we would have gotten more guidance in the last earnings release. And the fact that we didn't there leads me to believe that the previous guidance that you heard is probably going to be the same guidance going forward. Because it's not like that they raised the money and just said nothing. Right? If we go through the earnings transcripts, they absolutely have talked a little bit about what they're loosely looking to do. So let's take a look really quick. Lauren, are you going to find something really quick? No, not here. Okay. I was trying to find there was a couple things that I saw not too long ago. It's last earnings release. Obviously was essentially pretty sparse. It was just about the actual performance of the company. There wasn't a lot of forward looking guidance in it. And that's like that's the",

If you go through their earnings release, when you go through their actual investor relations, filings here, you typically, let me give you another example. A typical earnings release. Where is it? Oh, I don't want to. Yes. So for a comparison, if you take a look, a normal company, when they report their earnings, they essentially have a press release. They typically have a call. And it's during these things that you get a sense of what the company is about, what the company is thinking, what they're actually doing. There's some qualitative elements around the earnings release. If you look at GameStop by comparison, this is what GameStop gives you. Which again, objectively is trash. Like this is for an investor, for a standard investor, this is not what I want to see. Like what I want to see is the actual company talking about what they're doing, what they're planning. And GameStop notoriously does not really provide that. GameStop is a lot more quiet. They kind of move behind closed doors. And there could be a reason for that.

But you can, that's where you can get a little bit of that qualitative information about the company. So, do keep, I says GameStop is trash. Actually, don't agree with that. I think GameStop is a really interesting company. I think, I mean, objectively speaking, they're not the best performing company out there by far. It's not like a controversial statement that is exactly what this. But I also think that it's the kind of company that does have the potential to have a pretty strong turnaround. And that kind of strong turnaround can things like this can drive tremendous amounts of value if the turnaround is done well.

Because it wouldn't surprise me. Like this does have, and also did he, I didn't follow Chewie. Did he have a similar, because that would be interesting to be honest. If he had the same, if he had like the same approach with something like Chewie as well, where, well, let's see if we can find their old, the old statements. That would be kind of interesting to me. We used to have to find some of Chewie's old statements. Okay. So obviously their new stuff, they have press releases and stuff. But let's go back. When was this co-in the CEO? 2018. So 2011 to 2018.

But you can see they just started earnings presentations. Used to just be press releases and the financial docs. So that's for even Chewie. So yeah, I mean, there's a really good chance that they probably had a similar approach. ApexS GameStop has potential. I haven't touched it in quite a while in all honesty, but I think if they integrated somehow with like, meta or something, you know, yeah, I agree. And that's kind of the cool part about GameStop is that they have a really captive base. And again, like I'm always super straightforward with you guys. GameStop is a very small part of my portfolio.

I mean, I honestly think most like the vast majority of actual options trader know very little about GameStop. And it's because like in options trading, there's just there's so many things to do. And most like full-time options traders just move between opportunities as they exist. So like the reality is the vast majority of options traders don't know a whole lot about the majority of the companies that we trade, because we know most of the information is gonna be baked into the options chain.

He's a little bit older, but he has a insane amount of experience of making markets. And then also being an institutional prop firm style of options trading. And he also does options portfolio solutions for other kinds of portfolios like you know that are external to his fund that help streamline because one of the main uses for options is actually hedging risk and kind of providing that keel of a ship.

It picks as I've not traded options, you look for a lot of things. I know that. Is it true that you try to build into a position while volatility is lower along with the thousand other things? Not inherently no. Yeah, no, definitely not. It is entirely relative. Valtility being high or low is simply an input into the model of what am I trying to accomplish with a position? It's not volatility is low need to build positions because you can also build positions when volatility is high that either capture the movement subsequent or try to capture the collapse of volatility.

So it's kind of like the same thing with market makers. They think that in general their incentives are very clear like the way that they're making money in this case is right here. You see what's this average spread percent they're making money off the spreads. And that's why they might have an opinion in terms of directions sometimes and they might absolutely try to influence price movement if they can here and there. But it's not like the market makers are just behind the scenes like pulling these strings making stock a go up and stock b go down. It just the market is a little bit too large to work that way.

    "text": "the market makers are just behind the scenes like pulling these strings making stock a go up and stock b go down. It just the market is a little bit too large to work that way. And that's what it's kind of a good thing. But there can be pockets where there's price manipulation and I do believe there are clear instances that we can see it in something like GameStop. So again sometimes when I talk about this stuff people take binary positions and then they misinterpret what I say because I operate very much within the gray scale of things if this is an absolute left and right. I typically find to the best of my analysis what the gray scale is. Whereas most people they'll say exactly stuff like this right. If you go to the front it says the price of GMIs artificial. It's like it's not artificial. It can have manipulated elements. It can have misreportings at times. But to just blanket sweep say at all times now GameStop prices artificial. It just it doesn't really make sense. And I think people in general would be better off if they step away from like the binary evaluation of things and say well you know the market's completely rigged. That's not like they're absolutely our disadvantages and they're absolutely our periods where the market might be rigged in certain ways. I think a great example of that is naked shorting. What the fuck is naked shorting?",

But that aside and even though that fuckery is a foot it doesn't mean that everything everywhere is now all of a sudden manipulated and you can't trust anything and it's all bullshit. Again, there's a gray scale here. Just because this one thing exists that absolutely should not exist does not mean everything else is a facade in this bullshit. Naked shorting shouldn't exist though. That's fucking ridiculous. All right, let's continue. So market makers made an estimated bunch of money. We know that the market makers also took the full income of the shares they sold since they were selling pledge shares they never delivered completely agreed and that that is bullshit. This should not be a thing. The fail to deliver mechanism especially as it pertains to market makers is complete and utter fucking bullshit.

Same, same. We're chill. I know the fuck it's not. So yeah, completely agree with that point. That's fucking crazy. Absolute bullshit. This illustrates how the market makers generate off of any volume. They do this with nearly any security or transaction. They make a market for it. Yeah, I mean, that's correct. Again, like going back the other direction, that's the point of market makers is they provide liquidity and then they're compensated to provide the liquidity. So yeah, I think that this is correct. So the same activities that empower apes to create the moass also provide market makers with more resources to prolong the arrival of moass. This is actually inaccurate. It's not correct because they're essentially saying that what would prevent moass in this case or slow moass is the amount of money that a market maker has and that's really not it. The thing that leads to moass is a constrained underlying, meaning it's not readily available. And then you have the confluence of a short squeeze coalescing with the gamma squeeze.

I know that they probably have a very specific version of moass in their brain. And the difference is is that I find most of the people that hypothesize about moass from the game stop community, I find it to be way more from a theoretical perspective. People saying like, oh, this stock is going to 100,000 per share. And I mean, theoretically, I'm not even in a position to argue that one way or the other, because like I genuinely don't understand the economics of it in that capacity. I don't know. But what I do know is it's not going there. And the reason why it's not going there is because during the last squeeze, the main squeeze, when they turn off the fucking buy button, they stepped in front of it market forces institutional forces.

So I think it's fine to let the companies go insolvent that should go insolvent. But the broader point is for the expectations of moass, that's a tricky one, because they've already stepped in front of it and stopped it. So I don't see a world where they would allow moass to go further in the future than what it did previously. Because they already said that there's a risk to the financial system here. And I don't see them now saying, yeah, the risk is less, let's just let it go to 100,000 and see how it goes. And you just don't see that scenario. So anyways, back to the original point, because it's not constrained by capital, that's why I don't agree with this, that I think that the market makers capacity to create resources and make money, that doesn't stop moass from happening in its form. What would stop moass from happening is from the stock being readily available and from short interest contracting massively.

Once a firm hits critical massive transactions, becomes impossible not to deal with that firm. Yeah, I agree with this. That can grip from quotes took out to me, we manufacture money. Okay. I have a background in operations, manufacturing logistics. Okay. You can think of the financial industry as one that manufactures transactions in the same way the automotive manufacturers vehicles. Manufacturer transaction requires a buyer seller or product and is produced in a venue. The national supply comes from the collection of different factories. Okay. Just try not to understand their point. Your market maker and you already provide raw materials for the buyer seller and what would you do next if you wanted to grow? Okay. So they're just talking about how market makers or institutions are incentivized that expand their role in markets. That's what this essentially means.

If you go to a store and let's say, let's say you needed to grab a toothbrush and the toothbrush was the most easily accessible toothbrush in the entire store, you don't even have to get out of your car. They actually bring the toothbrush to you. But that toothbrush costs 500. Does the ease of access to that toothbrush overcome the cost of the toothbrush? And the answer is unequivocally no, it does not. So it's just a really important differentiating point for this corner three analogy of a buyer. A buyer is not interested in one thing being ease of access. If we were to talk about the one thing a buyer is interested, it's getting something at a good price to invert the example. Let's say that you could get a collector's item. And let's say it's a Pokemon card as a shout out in a salute to my boy, Richard Newton.

If you have to get on a plane and go fly to get it, you'd get on a plane and go fly to get it provided that the cost of the flight accommodations and getting it when you get there is cheaper than the card itself. The point is value is what buyers care about. It's not ease of access. Now that's again, it's not binary. That's not to say people don't care about ease of access. They absolutely do. But if it's a choice between ease of access and value, value wins every fucking time without a doubt. Okay. Yeah, see he hits it here acceptable prices. That's the most important part.

Citadel is moving beyond monopolizing the market maker role is captured a massive portion of all securities transactions is moving them off exchanges for an unisclosed portion of transactions. Citadel is the market. Yeah. Sort of. The moving moving volume off exchange isn't because of Citadel, by the way. Moving volume off exchange is from a buyer preference. And the reason why dark pools exist is to facilitate order flow. And one other really common misconception about dark pools is that dark pools still hit the consolidated tape. This stuff that is moved off exchange and does not hit the consolidated tape are things that are internalized. That won't hit the consolidated tape.

And it's because people can front run order flow. So then if I'm trying to put in a really big block order and I can see it getting chunked up because there's not enough liquidity at a certain price point, I can front run that order flow like a lot of other smart traders do me myself Eric. And there's institutions and high frequency trading firms that are poaching these orders essentially to front run the order flow because we know that there's a big order that's trying to get pushed through. So essentially we can buy into that and then buy into it here and then sell into that same order flow as it's moving up. So the point of dark pools is to prevent that kind of behavior which I do understand. But again, just an important differentiation. Citadel's overall volume market position are prohibitive to new competition and also drives way all but the largest competitors sort of. It's not prohibitive but it definitely is challenging like any large institution that becomes an incumbent like I do agree with that.

So I do get it and I do agree with the general sentiment. Everyone in this room knew about naked shortings. Citadel primary culprit. Yep. Yep. Okay. Citadel's defaulting is the equivalent of the entire economy getting full blown aids and spinal cancer at the same time. Not getting out the immune system and functional response. This leaves market vulnerable to violent price swings that can instantly bankrupt other players. Which is why the DCCC is so concerned about member defaulting and transferring assets. And another reason why Moas is taking so long every player in the economy needs Citadel assets to remain intact stabilize. Yeah. Well, again, the other thing to remember it's it's it's why Moas in the form that I'm assuming this person thinks of it and is is overwhelmingly likely not going to happen. And it's again, the same intervention that happened during 2008 when things are so off sides. I mean, it even happened during the intervention during COVID, right?

My underlying instinct is if we look at a price of GameStop and we think of areas. Right? So the idea of shorting. Shorting can happen at a lot of places. Now GameStop was obviously heavily shorted during this period at lows, which is really dangerous. Then as it starts to peak and spike up, the shorts are starting to cover because this is dangerous.

This is a hand grenade that is in the process of detonating and we have to try to throw it before it takes our hand off. Again, talking from the perspective of the shorts. But then as it returns back down to this level, you can cover. You can cover most of your risk and it's not really at a terrible loss because the other reality is it is insanely unlikely that they were short coming into this, buying into this and then did not have shorts coming through this. The very high probability is that they also would have profited massively from this down move, even though that the net impact of their position could be detrimental because of the overall shorts that they held coming into it and had to cover through it. So all of that aside, I don't think shorts right now, one, I don't think they're in a really dangerous spot because the stock is readily available. The stock is everywhere. One of the things that made this such a unique circumstance and why it ran the way it did is because at this point, GameStop was starting to be completely locked up. The float was small and with such a small float with the majority of it being locked up, it makes the stock itself very, very difficult to get in order",

The float was small and with such a small float with the majority of it being locked up, it makes the stock itself very, very difficult to get in order to close positions if you're short. Not so much the case anymore. So there are plenty of shares around for people to close out positions. And the thing is, is that anybody that has these massive open short positions, I guarantee you they're hedging around it with options and derivatives. There's no reason for them not to guarantee you that they're doing that. So it's not like they're going to be eating just taking it the shots in the face with the movement against them and just kind of like grip in the wheel holding it works out. Like institutions are sophisticated. They're not like retail traders when something goes against us. We just kind of like hold, hold out for hope. Like hope is not a strategy for professional traders. Hope can be there. Like it's nice to have it, but that's not a fucking strategy. So the reality is to summarize that random meandering of thoughts. I would imagine the shorts are a lot of different places. I do not imagine there are many shorts that got top ticked. I do not have meaning that kind of bottom tick. Like I don't think that there's going to be",

I do not have meaning that kind of bottom tick. Like I don't think that there's going to be a ton of shorts down here. And if there were, they would have been closing out. So and that's part of the movement that we saw, by the way, in this case. And that's also why this movement didn't go as haywire as it did before is because I think they were much wiser to the game. This go around than this go around. So I imagine the shorts that exist now probably have hedges in place. And I think that they would continue to hedge and increase the ratio of their hedge if there is a big move against them. And I think that they have access to the underlying. So where they are, I'm not really sure, but I also don't think it matters that much. Ben says, is it not possible that they figured out the deal with GME and other, there could be a spike, but there would never be a push to all time highs again. Yeah, that absolutely could be the case. Absolutely. I think that it's, well, I think it's much more likely that GameStop would approach all time highs through a fundamental reinventing of the business than another short gamma squeeze combined.",

That's what I think. Dark Gen says think GameStop can hit 40s in the foreseeable future without big hype. Yeah, I think so. I do think it can get into the 40s. I think the, again, I think at least in my mind, most of the primary price movement that you're going to see in GameStop is going to be a reflection of the actual business, like the actual underlying business and the operation of the underlying business, which I don't think is a bad thing, right? Because to trade through shorts, which I do when they happen, it's very difficult. And the liquidity typically is a pretty big problem. So I think the company being in a position where it can actually reinvent itself and make fundamental changes and change its value that way. I think that that's good. And I think that it's highly, highly likely because that's what this whole move was here. This wasn't on a bunch of hype. This move up here that we saw to the low 30s. That was on fundamental value. And I think that you're likely to see this kind of movement again once the company starts to sort itself out.",

And I think that you're likely to see this kind of movement again once the company starts to sort itself out. Because one of the things that I try to remind you guys in the use in my analysis is that after the company made its raises of capital, it then starts to beg the question, well, where's the floor? And how are we pricing the floor? And it's because they're in a better position now than they were here objectively. So then the real question becomes how do they use the money and then do investors see the future in terms of future cash flows of how they're going to use the money. That's the big question now. Because I'll be honest with you, if GameStop invests in some terrible business that everybody's like, oh, that fucking business is dying too, that doesn't bode well for the company. But if GameStop invests in something and they have a great direction that looks to be able to capitalize on its current assets, both tangible and intangible, then I think people start to say like, this company could turn around. And then that starts to lead to people taking speculative positions in the company, right? Because then it becomes from a value traders perspective, which is a lot of how big funds",

Because then it becomes from a value traders perspective, which is a lot of how big funds are going to operate long-term positions in this. The way that they look at this is from the context of risk to reward. If I think the floor in GameStop based on the breadth of my analysis, speaking from the lens of an institution, is 20 and a half, something like that. Because I think with the amount of cash that they have, the intellectual property and just the physical real estate blah, blah, blah, blah, I think it might be this, whatever it is. Then you start to say to yourself, well, if I get in here when it's 25, and I think the floor is 20 and a half and five points of risk, whereas based on the companies that it's investing in and how those companies are growing and the expectation of future cash flows, I think the company could be valued at 50. So then you're essentially taking five points of risk at a shot of 25 points of risk or reward, depending on the analysis and then the subsequent probabilities.

The things that cause persistent price trends of things are new investors coming in and leaving their money in the company because they believe in the future. That's what has to happen here. And I do think that that's absolutely a potential because it already started to happen here, which is super cool. But you need earnings. You have to have earnings that are growing. And right now the company is struggling with that. But if you have a company that has growing, earnings, growing revenue, growing sales, that becomes really attractive to a lot of people, especially if it's at a good value. The entire thing we talked about earlier, the thing that investors and traders really care about value. If it's at a good value, then they'll absolutely start to speculate with it for sure. Just a good risk reward ratio. Ben says, I would figure they just dump shares that makes them rich. Who's they? It's not possible to figure it out, the deal with GameStop.

That's not good either. Lauren says, what's your opinion about institutions growing their position? I think it's good. Actually, we can take a quick look at a chart. Let's see. I want to see if I can find a natural. I like this better. Let's see. Yeah, you can take a look. A bunch of these are building their positions. Let's see what's decreasing. Vanack, Renaissance, closed the lot. JP Morgan closed a bit. Let's see you look at expanding. Yeah, they took a leverage position. The reality is I think institutional sponsorship is really important. Intracking institutional sponsorship is really important because this is effectively how the company is going to grow longer term. You can see that net movement is positive. Most people are extending and expanding their positions or holding them only 89, a small subset goes to close out. I think institutions building their positions is really important.
