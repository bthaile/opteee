It's just going to take a hot minute for it to load because the document is pretty large. So we're going to take a couple of minutes and talk about where game stop is today, how things look, and then we'll continue down the path of this document here, which is analyzing the theories, planning the stream to be probably about half hour, something like that. And let's get right to it. Charlie, hope everybody is having an awesome weekend. And I still get the sense it feels like things are quiet from the ape community. It definitely feels like things have quieted down. I can kind of tell from a few different vectors, obviously the game stop videos that I put out. They always provide a proxy for how many people are actively engaging in the stock and then also, honestly, the number of emails that I get with people asked me to look at things, which is always actually very, very fun for me. But yeah, it seems pretty quiet. And it doesn't surprise me because I mean, if we think about a game stop has been essentially in a downtrend for two months now. So this downtrend started, I'll show you, after we had a bit of a peak here, we saw that in the beginning of January. Things",

So this downtrend started, I'll show you, after we had a bit of a peak here, we saw that in the beginning of January. Things were actually looking really good, really healthy. And then it's been slowly tailoring down from there. Now, I think the main question, at least in my mind, and probably everybody's mind, is where's the floor? Where does it actually seem like game stop is likely to gain some traction? And we can see that that's sort of happening here. I can get rid of this value. I'll keep that value area for now, because I want to talk about it actually briefly. We can give it to that one. And we still have this pretty well-defined descending channel. So as things sit today with game stop, the stock itself has been sitting on really, really quiet circumstances. There's really not a lot of news coming out. There's not a lot of buzz about what they're doing. There's not a broad overarching narrative that I'm seeing pushed out currently about game stop. There's definitely some glimpses that we've seen, and I've actually talked about this in a couple previous videos, with respect to Cohen. And he's alluding to things here and there, but nothing firm, obviously. And the broader market itself is also struggling right now. So if we take a",

So in Bitcoin, Ibit, just add a curiosity is down 12.8. Bons are up slightly, VIX is up slightly. The reason why I bother telling you these metrics is because it gives us a little bit of context around how the broader market is behaving right now, which is still part of what game stop fits in, which is the broader market. And I continue to see a lot of different theories and ideas around the price movement. It seems like people are still very, very interested in crack that code and I don't blame them. It's a very, very curious problem to try to analyze. But based on what I've seen so far, I still haven't seen any of these key theories panning out.

I don't really have one beyond the stuff that I've already talked to you all about with respect to price and volume. So the reason why I say it's an advantaged position is because it's always easy to look at other people's ideas and poke holes, but not give your own. And that's not really the aim of what I'm doing. I'm actively trying to see if I can identify any instances where it looks like there might be this broader underlying function that we may or may not be aware of or actively see. And in general, don't really see a lot of it to be completely honest with you. There are elements that I continue to see in terms of FTDs.

But that's just kind of like where things sit as of now based on the, I mean, many hours that we've spent at this point looking at the stuff together. Now, to take a look at GameStop itself. A couple things really stuck out to me. The first thing that stuck out to me was the behavior in this value area here. Now, I originally would have anticipated a little stronger price activity in this range that simply didn't happen. And it's just because we can see that price has interacted with this general range several times before just kind of bouncing right through it. Now, GameStop has been consolidating sideways for about four days straight. So a lot of people are now trying to figure out what is the actual price level that the market thinks GameStop deserves to sit at. And I think a lot of that really is predicated on the market's perception of what Ryan Cohen might be thinking to do. And we",

We know that they do have really strong positioning in terms of their cash. We've talked about that a million times. But the cash alone is not enough. You need more than just cash. It's a business. They're not a bank. They're not in the game of essentially borrowing from the federal government and then loaning out the money that they get from the federal government and capturing a spread like big banks can do. That's not what GameStop is. So while I will always reiterate the point, I see people talk about, oh, well, they're collecting interest on that money. They are collecting interest on the money. That's for sure. But again, that's not a viable business model. It's simply not.

And then if we take a look at his replies, there is this where the striveset management CEO essentially told Cohen that he should adopt Bitcoin as a reserve asset using the five billion. And then he responds, let it received. There's a reality here that the only reason why he would bother responding here is to fuel that general idea that GameStop might be getting involved in cryptocurrency. There's no other reason for him to respond to this other than that. This is essentially a way to make a public statement. Now, again, what that actually means, I really don't know, because even if GameStop gets involved into Bitcoin, that still isn't a business model. It's not. And for those that look at something like MicroStrategy, MicroStrategy is a completely different beast that is effectively a Ponzi scheme. Because using that convertible debt is soon as the stock price dips for some reason or another below some of those convertible rates, the price levels that they would be converted at, they now have a massive problem.

I know Sailor talks about it very eloquently in terms of intelligent leverage and he's not wrong. Sailor knows all about that stuff. He knows more about that stuff than I do. There's no doubt in my mind about it. But there's also the reality of what these convertible debt, what these convertible securities are. And so anyways, I make that point clear because for people that are looking at MicroStrategy and saying, oh, Bitcoin can do what they do. It's a terrible idea. Sooner or later, MicroStrategy is going to reap what they sell. It's just a matter of how long and who makes enough money on other funds as they come in. I genuinely hope GameStop would not go that route because I still think that they have the potential to make a meaningful change in their business model, which is effectively what has to happen here. I think that that is the case. So that's the latest as far as I see it with GameStop. It's kind of not a whole lot new. Like that's really what that amounts to in my opinion. There's not like a ton of stuff that I'm seeing. It doesn't have earnings until the middle of this month. So we still have a little ways to go before earnings will kick",

I don't know if you're seeing something different than what I'm seeing. But in general, that's kind of the the broad opinion that I have. I think that there's a little bit of buzz around cryptocurrency. And I'm not saying I think it's bad if they got involved in cryptocurrency. I think it could be fine depending on how much they use and what the game plan is. I'm not inherently against that. But I just don't I don't think that's enough. Like that that's just a piece of a puzzle. But the company still has to be a company. Still has to be a business and it still has to drive revenue.

Even if you started getting into Bitcoin now, I think over a long term timeframe, I think what you get Bitcoin for now is probably good, right? Like if we're talking a long enough time horizon, I think even if you top ticked it at 100,000 before the drop, if we're talking about a five year horizon, I still imagine that's probably a pretty good price compared to what it'll be at some point in the future.

I don't blame him because again, if one of the best things I saw in one of the videos is the one of my videos talking about this similar thing, and it genuinely is my exact same opinion. And it was a person that commented they were like, if I wanted Bitcoin, I would buy Bitcoin. Right? Like that's not why people are buying GameStop. People",

And it was a person that commented they were like, if I wanted Bitcoin, I would buy Bitcoin. Right? Like that's not why people are buying GameStop. People aren't buying GameStop to buy Bitcoin. When you buy GameStop, you're buying a completely different business model than that. But Lauren says I hope there was a bit more guidance next earnings, but he's not known for that. To be completely honest, I naively thought that we would have gotten more guidance in the last earnings release. And the fact that we didn't there leads me to believe that the previous guidance that you heard is probably going to be the same guidance going forward. Because it's not like that they raised the money and just said nothing, right? If we go through the earnings transcripts, they absolutely have talked a little bit about what they're loosely. Looking to do so let's take a look really quick. We're in my looking form trying to find something really quick. No, not here. I was trying to find there was a couple things that I saw not too long ago. It's last earnings release. Obviously was essentially pretty sparse. It was just about the actual performance of the company. There wasn't a lot of forward looking guidance in it. And that's like that's the fucking tricky part here, right? So like if",

So like if you go through their earnings release, when you go through their their actual investor relations, filings here, you typically let me give you another example. A typical earnings release. Where is it? Oh, I don't want to. So if for for a comparison, if you take a look, a normal company, when they report their earnings, they essentially have a press release, they typically have a call. And it's during these things that you get a sense of what the company is about, what the company is thinking, what they're actually doing. There's some qualitative elements around the earnings release. If you look at GameStop by comparison, this is what GameStop gives you. Which again, objectively is trash. Like this is for an investor, for a standard investor. This is not what I want to see. Like what I want to see is the actual company talking about what they're about, what they're doing, what they're planning. And GameStop notoriously does not really provide that.

Like that's, it's not like a controversial statement that is exactly what it is. But I also think that it's the kind of company that does have the potential to have a pretty strong turnaround.

I haven't touched it in quite a while in all honesty, but I think if they integrated somehow with like, matter or something, you know, yeah, I agree.

No, I forgot it doesn't let me zoom in slightly. Okay, so we're on the game stop price artificial thing. Citadel being a massive play in the market, which fun fact. Fun fact, um, Ken was at Trump's cabinet meeting. So the I'm not bringing that up because I know people are all over the place politically couldn't possibly care less. Just saying regardless of who the president is or that person to be meaning Ken to be in a cabinet meeting with whoever the president is is telling that they're obviously at the highest echelons of power within the US. And Ben says is GME like the white whale of options world. No, not really. I don't think so. I mean, I honestly think most like the vast majority of actual options trader know very little about game stop. And it's because like in options trading, there's just there's so many things to do. So this like full time options traders just move between opportunities as they exist. So like the reality is the vast majority of options traders don't know a whole lot about the majority of the companies that we trade because we know most of the information is going to be baked into the options chain.

So now there will be certain companies that are just you know larger than life so to speak and game stop is one of them because I have a good friend that I met through another friend who runs like ETF funds. And then I met this other friend through the ETF guy that is a market maker and he's worked at most of the large institutions and then he's opened up his own shop. And I regularly just hit him up to bullshit with him. He's a little bit older, but he has a insane amount of experience of making markets and then also being an institutional prop firm style of options trading. Because options portfolio solutions for other kinds of portfolios like you know that are external to his fund to help streamline because one of the main uses for options is actually hedging risk and kind of providing that keel of a ship.

Yeah, no, definitely not. It is entirely relative volatility being high or low is simply an input into the model of what am I trying to accomplish with the position.

It is a little bit too large to work that way and that's what it's kind of a good thing but there can be pockets where there's price manipulation and I do believe there are clear instances that we can see it in something like GameStop. So again sometimes when I talk about this stuff people take binary positions and then they misinterpret what I say because I operate very much within the gray scale of things if this is an absolute left and right. I typically find to the best of my analysis what what the gray scale is whereas most people they'll say exactly stuff like this right. If you go to the front it says the price of GM is artificial. It's not artificial it can have manipulated elements it can have misreportings at times but to just blanket sweep say at all times now GameStop prices artificial. It just it doesn't really make sense and I think people in general would be better off if they step away from like the binary evaluation of things and say well you know the market's completely rigged.

That's not like they're absolutely are disadvantages and they're absolutely our periods where the market might be rigged in certain ways. I think a great example of that is naked shorting what the fuck is naked shorting that shouldn't be a thing there should never be a case where a stock can have over a hundred percent of its fucking float shorted it just doesn't make sense. But that aside and even though that that fuckery is a foot it doesn't mean that everything everywhere is now all of a sudden manipulated and you can't trust anything and it's all bullshit right like again there's a gray scale here just because this one thing exists that absolutely should not exist does not mean everything else is a facade in this bullshit. And naked shorting shouldn't exist though it's that's fucking ridiculous. All right. Let's continue so market makers made an estimated bunch of money. We know that the market makers also took the full income of the shares they sold since they were selling blood shares and never delivered completely agree and that that is bullshit like this should not be a thing.

The point of market makers is they provide liquidity and then they're compensated to provide the liquidity so yeah I think that this is correct. So the same activities that empower apes to create the moass also provide market makers with more resources to prolong the arrival of moass this is actually inaccurate it's not correct because they're essentially saying that what would prevent moass in this case or slow moass is.

A very specific version of moass in their brain and the difference is is that I find most of the people that hypothesize about moass from the game stop community I find it to be way more from a theoretical perspective right people saying like oh the stocks going to 100,000 per share. And I mean theoretically I'm not even in a position to argue that one way or the other set like I genuinely don't understand the economics of it in that capacity I don't know but what I do know is it's not going there. And the reason why it's not going there is because during the last squeeze the main squeeze when they turn off the fucking buy button they stepped in front of it market forces institutional forces and again I actually don't even I don't fully disagree with it because although it would be really cool to see hedge funds that are naked shorting something get blown",

Because they already said that there's a risk to the financial system here and I don't see them now saying at the risk is less let's just let it go to 100,000 and see how it goes and you just don't see that scenario so anyways back to the original point because it's not constrained by capital that's why I don't agree with this that I think that the market makers capacity to create resources and make money that doesn't stop moass from happening in its form what the market is going to be.

Anyways let's continue volume is king once a firm hits critical mass of transactions becomes impossible not to deal with that firm yeah I agree with this. That can grip from quotes took out to me we manufacture money okay. I have a background in operations manufacturing logistics okay. You can think of the financial industry is one that manufactures transactions in the same way the automotive manufacturers vehicles. Manufacturer transaction requires a buyer seller a product. And is produced in a venue. The national supply comes from the collection of different factories.

The buyer is interested in one thing ease of access I mean that's literally completely wrong. This is completely wrong. What is a buyer interested in if you go to a store and let's say let's say you needed to grab a toothbrush and the toothbrush was the most easily accessible toothbrush in the entire store. You don't even have to get out of your car they actually bring the toothbrush to you but that toothbrush costs 500. Does the ease of access to that toothbrush. Overcome the cost of the toothbrush and the answer is unequivocally no it does not so. It's just a really important differentiating point for this corner three analogy of a buyer a buyer is not interested in one thing being ease of access.

Yeah, see he hits it here acceptable prices. That's that's the most important part. It's not just ease of access. Okay, we will continue. Volume is king citadel does so much volume that it's considered securities wholesaler citadel is a massive network of sales connections through market maker presence that exchanges. Okay. Citadel has ease of access advantage. They absolutely do. Citadel has a privacy and pricing advantage they do. I agree. So guess what citadel wants to do. Citadel doesn't need a venue citadel the venue citadel is internalizing a substantial volume. Okay. So they're essentially talking about how citadel is consuming more and more of the space which I agree with. Citadel is moving beyond monopolizing the market maker role is captured a massive portion of all securities transaction is moving them off exchanges for an unisqually portion of transactions citadel is the same. Yeah. Sort of the the moving moving volume off exchange isn't because of citadel by the way moving volume off exchange is from a buyer preference. And the reason why dark pools exist is to facilitate order flow and one other really common misconception about dark pools is that dark pools still hit the consolidated tape. This stuff that is moved off exchange and does not hit the consolidated tape are things that are internalized that won't hit",

This stuff that is moved off exchange and does not hit the consolidated tape are things that are internalized that won't hit the consolidated tape. Really important distinction and something I commonly commonly see misunderstood now the point that this is really important is that the decision to move orders off exchange is really more so for larger institutions. It's why dark pools were invented and it's because people confront run order flow. So then if I'm trying to put in a really big block order and I can see it getting chunked up because there's not enough liquidity at a certain price point. I confront run that order flow like a lot of other smart traders do me myself Eric and there's institutions and high for consider trading firms that are poaching these orders. Essentially to front run the order flow because we know that there's a big order that's trying to get pushed through so essentially we can buy into that and then buy into it here and then sell into that same order flow as it's moving up. So the point of dark pools is to prevent that kind of behavior which I do understand. But again, just an important differentiation.

It's not prohibitive but it definitely is challenging like any large institution that becomes an incumbent like I do agree with that is like if you think of something like Amazon. Really difficult to compete with Amazon if you're something else like that's not easy to do so I do get it and I do agree with the general sentiment. Everyone's room knew about naked shortings Citadel primary cope. Yeah, yeah, be up. Citadel's defaulting is the equivalent of the entire economy getting full blown aids and spinal cancer at the same time knocking out the immune system functional response this leaves market vulnerable to violent price swings that can instantly bankrupt other players. Which is why the DCCC is so concerned about member defaulting and transferring assets and another reason why Moise is taking so long every player in the economy needs to do assets to remain attacked stabilize. Yeah, well again, the other thing to remember it's it's it's why Moise in the form that I'm assuming this person thinks of it and is is overwhelmingly likely not going to happen.

So there are plenty of shares around for people to close out positions and the thing is is that anybody that has these massive open short positions. I guarantee you they're hedging around it with options and derivatives. There's no reason for them not to guarantee you that they're doing that. So it's not like they're going to be eating just taking it the shots in the face with the movement against them and just kind of like grip in the wheel holding it works out like institutions are sophisticated. They're not like retail traders when something goes against us.

We just kind of like hold hold out for hope like hope is not a strategy for professional traders hope can be there like it's nice to have it but that's not a fucking strategy. So the reality is to summarize that random me entering of thoughts. I would imagine the shorts are a lot of different places. I do not imagine there are many shorts that got top ticked. I do not mean that kind of bottom tech like I don't think that there's going to be a ton of shorts down here. And if there were they would have been closing out. So and that's part of the movement that we saw by the way in this case and that's also why this movement didn't go as haywire as it did before is because I think they were much wiser to the game this go around and this go around. So I imagine the shorts that exist now probably have hedges in place. And I think that they would continue to hedge and increase the ratio of their hedge if there is a big move against them and I think that they have access to the underlying. So where they are I'm not really sure but I also don't think it matters that much.

Ben says is it not possible that they figured out the deal with GME and other there could be a spike but there would never be a push to all time highs again. Yeah, that absolutely could be the case. Absolutely. I think that it's well, I think it's much more likely that game stop would approach all time highs through a fundamental reinventing of the business than another short gamma squeeze combined. That's what I think. Dark Gen says think game stop can hit 40s in the foreseeable future without big hype. Yeah, I think so. I do think he can get into the 40s. I think the again, I think at least in my mind, most of the primary price movement that you're going to see in game stop is going to be a reflection of the actual business like the actual underlying business and the operation of the underlying business, which I don't think is a bad thing. Right, because to trade through shorts, which I do when they happen, it's very difficult. And the liquidity typically is a pretty big problem. So I think the company being in a position where it can actually reinvent itself and make fundamental changes and change its value that way. I think that that's good.

And it's because they're in a better position now than they were here objectively. So then the real question becomes how do they use the money and then do investors see the future in terms of future cash flows of how they're going to use the money.

So then you're essentially taking five points of risk at a shot of 25 points of risk or reward, depending on the analysis and then the subsequent probabilities. So that's why this concept of value is really important because traders, we come and we go, we're unfaithful as fuck, we're in, we're out, we're moving in between things trying to find money. The things that cause persistent price trends of things are new investors coming in and leaving their money in the company because they believe in the future. That's what has to happen here and I do think that that's absolutely a potential because it already started to happen here, which is super cool. But you need earnings, you have to have earnings that are growing. And right now the company is struggling with that, but if you have a company that has growing earnings, growing revenue, growing sales, that becomes really attractive to a lot of people, especially if it's at a good value, entire thing we talked about earlier, the thing that investors and traders really care about value.
