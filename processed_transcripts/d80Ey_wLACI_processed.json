    "text": "You can't afford it. If you cannot afford to buy a depreciating asset in cash, you can't afford it. It doesn't mean that you need to pay for it in cash, for example, the car that I'm buying right now. If rates were really good, like what I got my house for, like 2 sure, then I will finance that because I can make an excess return by investing that money. It's good leverage. What's bad leverage is when you're paying 8.5 for a car that you otherwise couldn't afford because now you're stuck. You have no choice. You have to keep going to that job. You have to keep getting money to pay your car payment, to pay your mortgage. You start to live outside of your means and then you get stuck. Leverage is good. Leverage is bad. It depends on how you use it. Be an outlier, see you later.",
