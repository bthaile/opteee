It's great to see you again Hey, thanks. I don't even remember when the last time it was so I'm good Well, I can only imagine how much media you do. It's just kind of got to like be a blur in front of your face after a while Yeah, you know, it's funny you you look back at your life and you think that was never part of the game plan never I bet actually speaking of the game plan. I was listening to a recent interview of Years where you're talking about that finance wasn't even necessarily the initial target for you It kind of was an opportunity that emerged that you then took advantage of what what was the target like what did you think you were going to do? Oh, I was for sure going to be in I in my mind. I was for sure going to be in some form of of some form of government like I Was studying political science, but I was interning for you know in in the house of commons in the UK I was interning in upstate New York at the you know in New York New York that in their own You know state government and working for a lobbyist and for state senators and I",

I loved you know studying you know parliamentary studies and and different kinds of government studies And I figured you know I could do this lobbyist thing I could do this, you know and and and if all failed I could go back to law school But that wasn't what I wanted to do So I was I was a hundred percent Pretty sure that I was going into some form of you know, I don't know some form of government Interesting. So do you have any like pet projects where you're involved in government on the side or like did that just completely detach? It's attached, you know, I got bit by a bug in I got bit by a bug in when I got out of school and In the world of finance. It was kind of like you know, I just got bit mostly because of the trading floor I would say but I think once I stepped foot on Once I stepped foot kind of in the world of trading I just couldn't look any I know where else was interesting",

It was clear I that's where I needed to be. I didn't know how to I was gonna get there, but that's where I needed to be Interesting so when you realize that you're going down finance Did you have kind of some sort of big road map and just so you understand the Pramble that I'm kind of starting to get into as you talk a lot about decision cycles So I'm kind of like peeking into the way you think about decisions balancing two different things having some sort of plan and a road map But also taking advantage of opportunities going back to the Younger, you know, I was a little younger. I was a little I've always been kind of impulsive But but I don't think I had this I don't think I had a grand I don't I don't think I had this This blueprint or this road map all laid out in my early 20s But I think that you know, like I said as soon as I got",

I love the giant locker room, you know situation and It was kind of an extension of like, you know childhood sports and all that kind of stuff and I I couldn't imagine at that point doing anything else. I had to survive like it was I was I was freaking I'm gonna fucking survive this thing if it kills me, but I'm gonna survive this business and You know and I did luckily Was like when you were first starting out on the floor a lot of times people think that it's automatic money If you get to see, you know, then you just go in there and you make buckets of money and it's all gravy But you know the people I've spent a while you know reading because I've never had that direct experience But I'd love to hear from you what it was like when you first",

I was just really excited about you know about being in Chicago and being on the trading floor and You know all these little pits all over the place and people were screaming and yelling and I had to pick a spot the trade So I walked up this pit.

I definitely think that they're short-term price mean reversion But I'm more curious about your perspective So if you're a contrarian, but you don't believe in short-term price mean reversion isn't that a contradiction? It is Okay fair enough It is but there's a big difference between a short-term trade and you know It is a contradiction it is a contradiction But it's it's it's the whole the whole idea of being a contrarian It this stems back to this stems back to our days on the floor when you're essentially the counter party to everything somebody else wants to do So the the misconception about floor traders is that Is that you're just you're trading based on what you think the market's gonna do and that's not how it works floor traders All they did was take the other side of orders so You don't come in in the morning with an opinion of the market's going up and down You you go ahead and the pit in the",

I'll take the other side as long as you give me a little bit of edge Mm-hmm. I dig it. So that's not really kind of the classic That's not necessarily mean reversion.

They might not be successful enough It might not be worth it for waiting for that person waits for 100 forget it. They're out of business Right So when you're making this distinction between speed to decision How do you balance the idea of making a quick decision, but also not making a bad decision, right? Yeah, that's really so so the answer to that is there are there's no such thing You know, there's no such thing as you you cannot you cannot think about making a bad decision because Bad decisions are just it's a fact in an efficient world You are going to make extra number of bad decisions.

Do you think traders overcome that by just kind of embracing this decision cycle Is it successful detachment from their investing capital like what kind of things go into being able to accept a bad decision That was made apply the learning lesson and move on Well, I think yeah, it's all of the above.

So if somebody's willing to pay us Maybe more than we think we're worth will listen. That's an exit strategy But until that happens, you know, there is nothing When we sold fingerswim there were Three companies bidding for us in cash, but for the prior Ten years like we basically didn't have a single person talk to us When we sold tasty For we built in 2011 we sold it in 2021 For ten years not one person Talk to us about tasty now one person Now one firm not one anybody talk to us about tasty like not",

Like it just I couldn't process it I bet and then so you guys are in the process of you know, obviously still growing tasty you guys are still working on a lot of stuff So what's the what's the road map for you guys going forward? Are you just trying to promigate this even a wider degree have more people, you know, tuning into what you guys are working on and adopting your approach or just kind of playing it day by day you know I really love what I do So I hope I can do it, you know, I mean obviously You know, I'm probably the largest share one of the largest shareholders at IG were public company in London So I fully I'm all in and betting on ourselves for the next you know however long it is um So I",

That's back when I was in college Um, and I was already trading options for a while before that but The way that you talked about two things still resonates with me and I'm 32 now so the first one is Taking risk right that you were one of the the very few voices I heard Talking about accepting risk as compared to risk avoidance Not always resonated with me and then the second thing that you talked about is nobody knows anything and That is another one that I also had like a a mentor that helped me a lot with my trading that was an army veteran But he used to say literally the same exact line nobody knows anything and between both of those things I think and hopefully you guys know this already but at least from a personal perspective as a huge impact on At least the way that I approached life.

I saw investor education As being a very static business and also I don't like businesses that that rely on basically static content or static information It's almost it reminds me of too much of Like academia you can't change a curriculum because it's too expensive while the same thing investor education So the concept of investor education I was never able to buy into it.

It was always like listening to all the crazies that worked for him. It's the same as everybody and I'm no different than anybody else, you know like I could listen to him, you know To to guys like salg oven alley, you know talk for five hours straight even though It's the most it's the dumbest most ridiculous stuff I've ever heard like I'd sit there in my car to start laughing And be fascinated by it and and there was nothing to take away from other than a smile But I figured you know to a certain extent, you know, we can we can create Not the same thing, but in the world of finance we can be personalities and we can have a relationship With our with our viewers and that we don't care about how much money you have or how much you trade or you know How much you love us or hate us, you know Every day",
