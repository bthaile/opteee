    "text": "2023 marked my 16th full year of trading. So I want to walk you through six things I've learned over my 16 year trading career thus far at least provided that I don't love up soon, which hopefully not at this point. But what I want to share with you are a handful of lessons learned. Now some of these will be things that I learned early on. Some of these things will be what I learned a little bit later. But I want to specifically focus on some more off the wall ideas, meaning I'm not going to talk to you about the very basics of what it takes to be successful in trading like managing risk. Those are given. So I want to share with you some more of the nuanced concepts that I've learned over my career trading. What's up everybody? AirCure. Welcome back to the outlier, shout out to the Patreon family. Consider signing up. Let's get straight into what we got going on. So what's the first thing? The markets remind me of nature. And what I mean by that is nature doesn't really root for people. It doesn't really root against people. Nature is indifferent. If you watch any nature documentary, I watch them a lot because I'm fascinated by it. The animal kingdom is brutal. We think it's brutal. However, it's really not. It's not mean. It's harsh, but it's indifferent. That directly applies to the markets. The markets are indifferent to you,",

It's not mean. It's harsh, but it's indifferent. That directly applies to the markets. The markets are indifferent to you, to me, as individual retail market participants. The market does not care about you. So what that means is the markets are not actively trying to hurt us. They're not actively trying to help us. They are indifferent to our existence. So that means the markets don't care what's convenient for you. They don't care what you want to happen. They don't care what you want to trade. They don't care that you think if the pattern day trading rule didn't exist, that you would be a massively profitable trader. What you probably wouldn't be. That sounds right. The whole idea here is once you understand the world that we're operating in, the better off you're going to be. And what I mean by that is very first off the jump is that if you have a small account like most of us do when we started out, I started with less than 5,000, you are disadvantaged right out of the game. That's not because the market likes you or doesn't like you. It is simply a fact of the place you were trying to interface with. This is similar.

It is simply a fact of the place you were trying to interface with. This is similar. If you wanted to play professional basketball, if you are short, you are disadvantaged. Does that mean that you can't be mugsie bows and somehow figure it out? No, you can. It's entirely possible, but you are disadvantaged and you have to figure out another way to succeed. So when you're looking at small accounts, some of the disadvantages we have are the inability to achieve good diversification. You can't put on that many positions. You're limited in what products you can trade because some of them are too expensive. You're limited in what options structures you can use because if you sell a call, maybe the larger requirement is too high. There are limitations that you have that you have to learn to work around as best as you can. Now that should not be confused with adapting to a circumstance so that you can overcome it versus what is best. For example, many small accounts start with vertical spreads. I hate vertical spreads. I talk bad about them all the time because in general, I do not think they're a great option structure. If you were a small account, you ain't got that many choices. Maybe you adopt using vertical spreads to get your feet under you. You're",

If you were a small account, you ain't got that many choices. Maybe you adopt using vertical spreads to get your feet under you. You're not trading them 1 wide so that you can at least attempt to make some money. Just because vertical spreads are what you can trade does not mean that they're what makes sense. That's why when I did the small stack segment not too long ago, well maybe two years ago, so it isn't a minute ago, I used things like ratio called diagonals. They were a better alternative to me given the constraints of a 5,000 account than trading something like vertical spreads. The same thing when I trade my favorite strategy, the coverage strangle, I love that strategy. In a small account, it is next to impossible to deploy that without using your entire account. These are the concessions that we make. This is also why you absolutely need to save. There's no substitute for saving early on in your trading career. Smart ideas mean nothing. This is our second lesson learned. I have come across, I cannot tell you how many truly brilliant people in this space. I've talked to people that have PhDs. I've talked to people that literally have sold hundreds of millions of dollars of businesses that they've built. What I've learned is that",

I've talked to people that literally have sold hundreds of millions of dollars of businesses that they've built. What I've learned is that I'm pretty fucking stupid. Are you stupid or something? But that part aside, I've learned something more interesting. Trading is a balance between theoretical understanding of something and practical application. So what that means is you can have somebody that's incredibly smart, that's able to piece everything together to build this beautiful narrative on why everything's happening in these nice succinct summaries. They might know everything that's going on. It might not matter. The world of trading is the world of practical application. It's where we take a reasonable theoretical understanding of things. We see how it actually works in the real world and then we find a way to interface with that. One of the things I find is that people who are really smart that want to have an explanation for everything. A lot of times they struggle in trading because things are not quite that discrete. And even though you might think you are 100 correct and this thing shouldn't have done whatever it did. It doesn't matter literally at all. What matters is what price does. That's what matters. Some people really struggle to accept that fact. That leads into our next point of the process.",

That's what matters. Some people really struggle to accept that fact. That leads into our next point of the process. There was a study done that I don't remember the origin of. I saw this back when I was in my undergraduate. So I don't remember what it was. Take this with a grain of salt. But what I remember reading was that some of the more prestigious style jobs, doctors, lawyers, stuff like that, people like that tend to trade poorly. And I remember reading about the reasons why. And it came down to this idea of ego. And it came down to this idea of their ability to cleanly summarize things. And then they have the utmost conviction in their summary that then might not be validated by the market. Removal of ego is a non-negotiable in trading. There's a big difference between prediction versus a forecast. Prediction of something is when you have a high degree of certainty. Forecast is where you have kind of an idea of what might happen, but you're not really ultra convicted about it. Now in trading, like most things in life, it requires a balance between these two. Because if you attempt to trade off of something that you have no real basis behind it, then you're not going to probably",

Because if you attempt to trade off of something that you have no real basis behind it, then you're not going to probably want to commit a bunch of capital to it. However, if you are so wrapped up in your thesis that you fail to acknowledge that it might not work out, or when it doesn't work out that it has this really significant emotional impact on your ability to process things, all of that is a giant attractor from profitable trading. So what I think about here, when I talk about even directional forecasts that I have, I view them as probabilistic outcomes. I might think something is a 60 chance of happening, but I acknowledge that 40 chance of it not happening is pretty damn high and it might not happen. If it doesn't happen, that's okay. Any one trade that doesn't go in your favor, it's not going to kill you when you become a trader is when you stop over emphasizing each individual position you have on and you favor the process and the systematic application there of over time. That is what leads to profits. Overall, we care about what the truth is regardless of what we think it should or should not be, which leads to this exact idea of having an iterative process. So the",

Overall, we care about what the truth is regardless of what we think it should or should not be, which leads to this exact idea of having an iterative process. So the reason I say iterative is because when I first started making my trading plan way back in 2008, 2009, I really had a rudimentary group of things in there that probably would make me laugh today, but it's where I started and that's okay. So when we look at our application as traders, it's something that we have to build over time. Now, last year's a prime example in 2023, I had a series of various risk premium plays that I typically use. Some of the structures that I typically used, I noticed in the near term data started behaving differently than I thought it should have compared to the longer term run rate. So then I started doing more testing given the current market conditions and it caused me to make a switch that I'm very thankful that I made because I still continue to run a paper version of the old iteration of the strategies compared to a live version of the updated version of the strategies and they performed much better. You have to acknowledge that there's some degree of overfitting that may or may not happen here, but if we maintain a good assessment and have",

You have to acknowledge that there's some degree of overfitting that may or may not happen here, but if we maintain a good assessment and have varied outcomes moving forward, you can minimize overfitting to a pretty significant degree. And for those that are unfamiliar with this overfitting concept is, it's essentially if you backtest something and you cherry pick the absolute best structure for that given point in time and then in going forward, you're not accounting for variance off of that previous movement. It's essentially trying to drive forward looking in the rear view mirror. We don't want to do that, but you do have to adjust to meet market conditions because they change noise. I have a really interesting perspective on this in that I genuinely do not listen to anybody else. I do not pay attention to what people say is going to happen in the markets on Twitter. I do not care quite literally whatsoever. There is a difference between gathering information, which I do all the time. I'm looking at news articles.

You have to learn to be autonomous, operate on your own. That's exactly why I have my entire community, the outlier community, built as I do. I do not want anybody to see me as an oracle because I'm not. I'm just a fucking internet dude. But what I want people to do is to build this skill sets to then move themselves forward and evolve as traders and provide some structure to help them do that. But noise gets you nowhere in the markets and there's plenty of it. Everybody wants to feel smart. They want to throw their ego out there because they want that validation. This is the same thing when you see all of these different pundits that have the most beautiful discrete synopsis of everything that's ever happened in the markets as compared to what most of us actually know is going on, which is we don't have any fucking idea.

This is hands down the most important thing that I've done to completely revolutionize my performance as a trader is adding structure and organization to my process. Early on I did not have a trading plan. Early on I did not have a trading log without both of those documents. You are essentially trying to fly a plane that you can't see out the window maybe because you're in a cloud with no gauges. You have no idea what's going on. You have nothing to reference. You have nothing to create assumptions that you can then tighten over time. This is where all of the work of trading is done. Right here creating the structure, creating tracking.
