    "text": "A few people asked me why I'm moving a bunch of money into commercial real estate when I'm a trader. I've essentially spent most of my life developing my skillset to trade. And guess what? It's a fucking math problem. I can do really well in these commercial real estate deals. I still will continue to trade for sure. However, it's so important to not get attached to the craft itself and understand what is the purpose of the craft, which is to make money. So that is what I'm focused on. Where can I make the most money and reduce risk? Because here's another thing. I never know when my skill set in trading is going to be phased out by something. So to me to think that I'm going to be able to bank off of that for the next hopefully, 60 years is pretty naive. You've got to build some redundancies in this system once you create some wealth. Be an out-of-the-art see-all later.",
