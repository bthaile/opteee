    "text": "Don't let the alert of zero DTE options make you think that there's less risk involved. There's a benefit. There is no overnight risk because zero DTE means the options expire in zero days, the same day. So you don't have overnight risk that's good. The problem is options are priced pretty efficiently. So what that means is if you think, oh well, most of these are going to expire worthless at the end of the day, let me sell some of them. It's just one big move you need before you wipe out a bunch of profits that took you weeks or months to accumulate. And the inverse happens when you're buying, you might lose a whole bunch of time trying to make a few dollars, and after commission fees slipage, it might not make sense. That's not to say never trade them, but I wouldn't use that as your only trading strategy. I would have some other stuff in the toolkit and apply zero DTE when it makes sense. Being all our sea guys later.",
