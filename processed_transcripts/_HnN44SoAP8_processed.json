    "text": "What's up, outliers? Quick market update. Two things on the agenda. First we have Visa with its new antitrust lawsuit coming out, which we'll talk about quickly. And then we're going to take a look at you, meaning Unity, because there's a lot of talk about some trades flowing in that are of interesting size, meaning 5,000 lot options trades. That's actually popped up earlier for me today. And I think it's kind of interesting to keep an eyeball on. So let's start with Visa. What's going on here? Well, it's pretty straightforward. So you can see that the Justice Department accuses Visa of stifling competition in the debit hard business. So why does this matter? Well, it essentially shows that the Justice Department is starting to attack some of these perceived monopolies. I don't exactly want to go as far as to call it as a monopoly, but you can see that Visa controls more than 60 of debit card processing. And this is one of the really interesting factors that go into a economy and overall capitalistic structure like we have here is where is that line drawn between letting good businesses grow and thrive versus good businesses being given excess advantages that then allow them to dominate a landscape. And it's a really interesting discussion to be had. But we can see here, it says Visa handles more than 60 of debit card transactions and collects more than 7 billion in annual processing fees. And it uses",

And it says we alleged that Visa has unlawfully amassed the power to extract fees that far exceed what it could charge in a competitive market. And this is kind of the interesting balance between regulation and free capitalistic society. It's not an easy answer. And I'm not here to weigh in on it. I'm here just to show you what it says. It says merchants and banks pass along those costs to consumers, right? Pass through costs either by raising prices or reducing quality of service to decrease the cost it makes to make it. So this essentially is alleging that Visa's conduct ultimately impacts the consumer and that this is spread into just about everything. Now, what I find slightly interesting here is if we take a look at this and I'm not super positive on this source, I'm just looking for some numbers. And it says essentially in 2021, we can see credit card purchase volume is like 52.5. So that's actually meaning that there is a pretty significant amount of debit card transactions that happen.

And I just find that generally interesting because that really bolsters this argument that there's a pretty significant market here that Visa is looking to dominate. So we can see that merchants are on board because obviously they just pass through the cost anyway. They generally don't care. And it says Tuesday's lawsuit is not the first time Visa's run a foul of the Justice Department four years ago, the government suits a block visa from acquiring a Fintech company, Plaid, which most of us are familiar with. And it says if you the 5.3 billion takeover as an insurance policy to prevent Plaid from infringing on its lucrative debt debit card. And again, that's the, this is something that we saw through Facebook previously now meta that they used to literally buy companies and just nuke the company to get rid of the competition. And again, it's really hard to say in a theoretical standpoint, if that's good, if that's bad, if that is capitalistic, if it's not, if there should be regulation.

So we now have Visa that is down 5.5 today, big, big, big sale volume. And we can see that it was doing great right before this news. And the way that this is going to work now is volatility has already started to creep up. We can see implied volatility percentiles now at 81. So for me, I look at it very simply is how can I trade this? Again, theoretical, existential conversations aside about what we think is right or wrong, completely different. That's a different part of my brain. This part of my brain is like, how do we trade this? And there's lots of ways to trade it. Now, we can trade a directional move here assuming that this move might continue or depending on how it behaves over the next day or so. We can see if it starts to rebound and rally right back up. So this could be a buy the rumor sell the news kind of scenario. We don't know just yet, but what I can tell you is that catalysts like this offer interesting opportunities.

But we have to see how all this is digested and then the market's perception of essentially what will happen here, which is TBD obviously. So now if you take a quick look at the options, change that a curiosity. We can see a few things. We can see volume on the put side definitely expanded today. And you can see that a lot of it where people buying puts 22 came in and rightfully so scooping up the downside opportunity. They're playing the 20 step expiration. That's where all this volume was today. It's people hedging existing positions. It's people gaining exposure to play it to the downside. But here's what I want to see is how much this call put OI starts to change because it's been maintaining call skew. So I tracked Visa pretty regularly and this is its normal configuration where it's pretty bullish in terms of the options chain.

So there's some people that had an idea of what's going on, which is always entertaining to see. Gotta be honest with you. Love that about options markets though is that people that have leverage want to express an idea. And people who typically are informed seek leverage because then they can express an idea and make more money. Good old greed. It never goes out of style. So that's that. Next up we have you.

And it's really interesting though, because we see those 5,000 blocks at a couple different strikes over a few different days. That part I genuinely do find interesting. So if I sort these instead by premium, if I sort them by time really quick, we can see that throughout the day, there's a bunch of small trades, right? 10,000, 20,000, 2,000 tons of these smaller trades that don't really mean that much to us. But then if we sort it by premium, all of a sudden we see that we get these blocks of 5,000 that drift up to the top. We can see them starting on the 23rd for sure. And there were a few tranches. So I see 1257, 1259 from yesterday, the 23rd, 1254, 1252. And this is at the 15, the 20. And then I see the 20 and the 20. So it looks like somebody getting exposure to a few different spots here. But if we look at the dollar value on these, all of a sudden we are massively sized. We've gone from looking at stuff that's a few 10,000s of dollars to a couple that are hundreds of thousands, a couple half a million",

We've gone from looking at stuff that's a few 10,000s of dollars to a couple that are hundreds of thousands, a couple half a million dollar trades. And then all of a sudden we have trades that are several million dollars. This is not a small position. That's all there is to it. This looks like at least two different positions being built. So we can see some of the 15s that are being built out in 2025. And then we can see some that are being built out in 15, no 24. That's what these are. So whether or not that's the same person, different person. Again, it's a crap shoot. Really, really difficult to tell. But what I can tell you is that these 15s are being hit in a few different spots. Because I see the 15s here on 17, Jan 25, I see the 15s here on 15, no 24. And then I see the 15s here on again 17, Jan 25. And then I see the 15s with the slightly smaller trade out in 25 again. And then if I look at the 20s, we see them in 25 here. We see them 15, no 24, 25 again. So this is kind of a split of different things. Now for people that think that this is roaring kitty, again, I",

Now for people that think that this is roaring kitty, again, I don't blame you for thinking and who knows who it could be. But I do highly recommend check out the series that we've been doing on Saturday, the GameStop series, because I literally started going what three weeks ago, we went all the way back. And we're right now still in the process of it. The next one is this coming Saturday. We're literally going trade by trade to see what he did when what the market looked like, what he did all the way back to the very beginning of his Reddit profile. The reason is I call it fingerprinting. It lets me get an understanding of how something looks behaves that's unique to that thing, in this case, that thing being our boy, roaring kitty. So while this could be the cat, I don't instinctually see him here based on what I've seen him do previously, meaning when I've seen him establish and change previous positions, it's not across a bunch of different explorations across a bunch of different strikes. What I've seen, he tends to layer into something. And then when he wants to add more exposure, she'll layer into something else. But this is all about",

What I've seen, he tends to layer into something. And then when he wants to add more exposure, she'll layer into something else. But this is all about the giant caveat. We're not done yet. Right now, like I said, in that series, I think we're still in, we're at the end where there be the end of 21 or the beginning of 2022. So we're getting there, but we still have a ways to go. But all I'm saying is this looks a little bit different than what I've seen so far. Does that mean it can't be him? Of course not. It could be. Every time we see 5,000 lot trades that it is him, also absolutely not. There are, there's a human tendency to use round numbers. You'll see things like this, this is a bigger trade for sure, but you'll see 5,000 blocks, 2,500 blocks, 10,000 blocks. Those are just instinctual numbers that people use when you're trading at larger sizes. So if you decide that you're going to put on a bigger position that's worth a few million dollars, you're kind of backed into a trade, right? Like a standard sizing. Most people are not coming in to put in a trade that's, you know, 1,526. It's going to be a round number more often than not. That's why if we take a",

It's going to be a round number more often than not. That's why if we take a look at these strikes in unity, you'll notice the same thing I try to draw your eye to pretty frequently. Where if we go to these round number strikes, they're almost always more active than other strikes in terms of open interest. And that's because of this very natural tendency. So for example, if I look at these 25 calls in 18 oct, there's 11,900 of them. Then if I go to the 30s, round number, there's 47,000 of them. Then if I go into the 20s, round number again, kind of moving in five dollar lots here, there's 11,000 of them. So even though there's options that are much better closer to the money, like these, they're still smaller size than something like the 20s or the 25s of the 30s. Human tendency. You'll see this all the time and options markets. So I would always say approach things with an open mind. Who knows what's happening, but also understand the landscape. And this kind of thing is very, very normal. So we got to see what's going on with you though, because it is definitely starting to get a bit of legs underneath it. We'll take a closer",
