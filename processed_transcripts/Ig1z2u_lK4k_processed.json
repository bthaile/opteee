    "text": "As a trader, you are taught to diversify, even as an investor. This is one of the basic concepts of building a robust approach to investing as an umbrella. However, like most things in markets and trading specifically, there's a lot of nuance. And in that nuance is the potential to really increase your returns or really hurt your returns. So the goal is videos to walk through that exact nuance. I want to walk you through the process of building a diversified options portfolio specifically built around your use case as an individual because not all diversification is created the same and that has to be kept in mind. So let's start first with just defining this idea of diversification. And there's basic definitions and then there's common use definitions. We're going to use the common use definition here. It's more practical. This is essentially where you spread your money, your investments across different asset classes. And the idea is as some asset classes are doing well, others won't be doing well and they'll kind of balance each other out and reduce some of the overall risk. However, with options, as you know, options add complexity and more elements to a trade and we can achieve even greater types of diversification when we do trade options. So the first thing that I want to start with really it's the first two things on this list. Three things is we really want to understand what our current assessment is of",

Three things is we really want to understand what our current assessment is of the market. The reason for that is if we're going to tailor and customize our diversification approach to suit the current market needs, we have to have an understanding of what the current markets are and what we want our portfolio to look like. A great example last year in 2024. In the beginning of the year, I was long small caps because I was expecting rate cuts earlier in the year based on positioning and then after a couple of months it ended up not happening. So then I had to pivot that position into other things that were more topical and relevant to the market as it sat at that time. So that's based on an economic and stock market analysis and then updating that analysis. You have to start with that because for example, if you're really, really bullish, that will lead to one portfolio structure as compared to if you're kind of bullish, but you're kind of nervous about a downturn. So that will lead to another which blends beautifully into the second thing on this list, which is that of purpose. A lot of times people default into doing things because it sounds smart or",

A lot of times people default into doing things because it sounds smart or it's something that they've been told that they should do. So then we just kind of start doing it without really thinking about the purpose and does it apply to us. So what this means is if we are thinking about building a diversified portfolio, what is the actual purpose for you? Great example. Let's say that you're really, really bullish, you think the market's going to go up a lot and you're just typically taught to diversify, but you're an active trader so you're going to use momentum, moving averages and stuff like that to scale in and scale out of your position, which inherently manages your risk. So then you might say to yourself, well, I don't actually really want to diversify that much because if I have a bunch of different non-correlated returns and I get the move that I think is going to happen, the stock market's going to go up a lot, well, I'm not really going to benefit from that as much. And I'm already going to manage risk to the downside by scaling out of positions, getting hit at stop losses and stuff like that. So when we're talking about this idea of",

So when we're talking about this idea of diversification, it's really, really important to define what you're doing and why. So some common uses for diversification, the first one you already heard is absolutely to reduce portfolio risk where we have some things that make money at a point in time and other things that might be losing money at that same point in time. And they kind of offset one another a little bit. The second purpose is actually more appropriate for somebody like me where I primarily am managing risk through sizing and the actual management of the strategy. So the second purpose is if we're trying to trade any kind of market condition. So that means when the market's going up, down sideways, broad market trends, you have to have different kinds of things in your portfolio to take advantage of different market forces that are going on at a given point in time.

And a lot of names like RGTI and so on and so forth, they got slammed after that. And they started making a little bit of a recovery. So there might be an opportunity there, specifically in trading the recovery move there. There's also earnings going on right now, which provides a non correlated return source from volatility. So I'm inherently diversifying by trading these different kinds of profit mechanisms simply because there are different things that make sense right now. So that's the second purpose of diversification in my opinion is to be able to take advantage of different things at the same time. Now when we're deciding what our diversification is going to look like, we have to decide what our portfolio exposure is going to look like and what we're comfortable with. The reason why that's so important is because of reverse planning. It's when we begin with the end in mind. It's where we're visualizing what this thing is supposed to look like. And then we kind of create a roadmap to get to whatever that end state is from where we are today. So what that looks like specifically for target portfolio exposures, we might say I want to earn at least 10 per year. Cool. If I have a hundred thousand dollars, that tells me I need",

So what that looks like specifically for target portfolio exposures, we might say I want to earn at least 10 per year. Cool. If I have a hundred thousand dollars, that tells me I need to make a certain amount on average every single month in order to hit that at the end of the year. So then I can figure out what my portfolio exposure needs to be based on my risk management plans, both profit and loss for all of the trades that I'm going to put on because like a good trader, you are defining that before you enter your position. So you can see how many positions you need to have on at a given point in time in order to maintain that slide slope. That's the purpose here. So now let's talk about the actual elements of diversification within options. There's a bunch of them. You've already heard me use the term correlation a few times. This is the relationship between two different securities. One thing to know about correlation is that it is not static. A great way to visualize this is if we pop over to the platform and we take a look at Bitcoin and E-minis. We literally talked about this on our livestream not too long ago. So that's why it's up.

And I want you to take a note of the correlation across all these different time frames. So this is using a three day five day 10 day 30 day 60 90 180 360. And let's take a look in the short term correlation. If I eyeball this short term correlation, I see three day and five day, it's like 95. However, if I go out here to a 30 day correlation, it's actually like 57. And then if I go out again to a 360 day correlation, it's like 90. So what I'm showing you is the relationship between these tickers changes. So then when we're analyzing correlation, we need to do two things. We need to make it relevant to the time frame we're trading. But then you also need to look at it across different time frames to have a sense. So like this is a great example. Even though there's one period where it's like 57 correlated, which is on the lower end, in general, it's above 70. So it's generally correlated. There are periods where that correlation becomes dislocated, but that's pretty constrained here. That's the point. Next, we have the direction. One of the beautiful things about trading options is you can trade things in all different directions",

    "text": "the lower end, in general, it's above 70. So it's generally correlated. There are periods where that correlation becomes dislocated, but that's pretty constrained here. That's the point. Next, we have the direction. One of the beautiful things about trading options is you can trade things in all different directions with different kinds of strategies, which is the next bullet point. We kind of blend these two together. So with direction, I can trade things up down sideways. With strategies, I can trade things with long premium or short premium. Long premium will be undefined profit. Defined risk. It will suffer things like Theta decay. It will be think long gamma, think like that. Short options or short premium will have defined profit, undefined risk. It will be collecting theta, which benefits the position. And the way that those trades perform over different time frames will be very different. So you'll see in a little bit when we get into an example, we can build something that blends all this stuff together. So as I've already noted, we can go across different kinds of aspirations. And we can also trade tickers of varying volatility levels. One of the things you will have heard if you sell premium frequently is, oh, you know, you got to look for stuff that's high volatility to sell. Well, that might be okay, but there's a lot of drawbacks to that because if you build a portfolio where you're selling premium only in high volatility",

Well, that might be okay, but there's a lot of drawbacks to that because if you build a portfolio where you're selling premium only in high volatility tickers, guess what? Your portfolio is going to be super volatile. That's what volatility is. So if you're okay with that, cool. But if you're not okay with that, then you have to consider what you're building. Let's talk about some common mistakes. These are pretty simple, but defaulting to a specific kind of strategy. The issue with this is you start to stack things together. And then you have a portfolio that kind of looks like one thing. So let's say you like to sell puts. If all you do is sell puts, you're going to have a bunch of stuff on that is defined profit, undefined risk, and is going to be probably giving you some pain potentially from something like gamma. So even if you prefer to sell, that's fine, not my approach, but it's fine as long as we're including some other kinds of strategies to help offset some of that concentration. Next, super, super simple is miss sizing trades in the overall portfolio. This is what happens when we're too focused on the profit side of the equation, and we're not paying attention to the risk side of the equation. And then the last super",

This is what happens when we're too focused on the profit side of the equation, and we're not paying attention to the risk side of the equation. And then the last super common mistake is when we do not think about how the trade is going to behave over its lifespan. So what that means, again, going back to the short put example, if you're trading a bunch of short puts and you're just thinking about the credit that you're going to collect in how it's a high probability trade, but you're not realizing the fact that as you hold short puts, gamma, big moves in gamma, can really cause a lot of volatility in the portfolio, which can be unnerving if you're not thinking about it. That's the kind of stuff we're talking about here. Now, let's talk about a step by step process to build your very own diversified options portfolio. First thing, we start by establishing goals. Next, we come up with our current disposition for the economy and the stock market. This informs how we are going to use our portfolio. How much do we want to use? How do we want to split it up? We can use things like beta waiting to put the risk of whatever you're looking at in the context of a single underlying. I have a video that talks all about beta",

If you don't split your portfolio up like I do, this is essentially where you divvy up your money, where you're going to put it into what trades and why. If you're curious how I manage a portfolio, I have a link to that. I will throw that in the notes below. Next, we start figuring out the individual strategies that we're going to put on to make sure that we have a mix of different directional plays if you want that we have long and short premium trades if you want. Notice, I'm saying if you want, because again, this is relative to your perception of the current market. Another example, using the short put example.

If you're expecting a big market contraction for some reason, whatever that reason is based on your research, you might not want to have all of your portfolio in short puts because the risk reward profile on that starts to become skewed if that risk ends up being realized. This is exactly why you have to start and go in this order to make sure everything that you're doing is aligned. Next, we need to identify the tickers, the kinds of tickers that they are. One of the great things you can use when you're analyzing different tickers is you could take a peek at the beta. The beta tells you how does it move in relation to the market and in general, we use the SP 500 to represent the market. So spy will be one. If I take a look at QQQ, you'll notice that the beta is 1.3. That tells me that the NASDAQ is more volatile than the SP 500. That means if the SP 500 goes up by a dollar, we might expect the Qs to move by a dollar 30 up or down, both in favorable direction and non favorable direction. So we need to identify the tickers that fit in with the broader portfolio. And then I like to spread across some different time frames. So let's take a look at this.

Let's say that we're bullish right now, we're risk open, we're ready to use up to 100 of the portfolio. So we're figuring out what we want to put on. So we're going to use a 100,000 portfolio. We're going to say that we're going to use 60,000 in the core allocation allocating 60 of it, long beta. That's to track the broader market. And then we have about 40,000 we can use at no more than 2 risk per trade for other things. So now we start putting the actual strategies on of this 60,000 that's going to be allocated to the coverage strangle. Maybe I start with 45,000, leave them 15k to scale. Then I might look at adding some other strategies into the mix here that allow me to tweak the overall portfolio risk, something like volatility risk premium trades, which I have a video for that a link below are really great because it's kind of non correlated returns. They're just going to do whatever they're going to do by themselves, which is beneficial because it's not going to have a direct relationship with the rest of the portfolio. And then maybe we",

They're just going to do whatever they're going to do by themselves, which is beneficial because it's not going to have a direct relationship with the rest of the portfolio. And then maybe we have things that are more directly correlated. We're trading like a momentum breakout style strategy. Again, limiting risk to no more than 2 for this case, no more than 1 for the risk premium approaches. And for the momentum approaches, we might have three to 10 trades on at a given point in time with at least 20 of them providing short beta weighted delta's to your core holdings. This starts to offset things. Now the 20 short is going to be completely variable based on this thing up at the top, which is your current disposition towards the market. If you don't think the market's going to go down, you think the market's good where it is, then maybe you don't have any short because you're not, you don't think the market's going down. But if you start to see the market rolling over, you start to see short term moving averages, um, faltering on a bunch of different sectors. We're seeing all the sectors running negative, trending down. Maybe we start jacking up the number of short holdings we have on this part of it. Maybe we start sizing this down in order to manage our risk. It's",

Maybe we start jacking up the number of short holdings we have on this part of it. Maybe we start sizing this down in order to manage our risk. It's all entirely up to you, but you have to define it. So I want to show you a cool tool in here, which is thinker swim. We could take a look at this is the risk profile, but what you can do actually down here is you can move this to your entire portfolio. So what I have is a bunch of random trades in here, just for an example, and what I'm showing you is I can put my entire portfolio against something like spy. And I can say based on this hypothetical portfolio where I'm trading cues so far in MSTR, I can figure out if the SP 500 drops 10 and goes down to 550, I would be down 18k. M-I okay with that. Does that feel reasonable? And maybe it does, maybe it doesn't. So if it does cool, if it doesn't, then maybe I say, well, I'm going to scale down my cues position. And then if it actually does move down a full 10 not a little bit shy, but we're actually full 10 closer to 540 and we're at 16k at that 10 move, we're like, okay, yeah, that's fine. Based on my",

Based on my portfolio size, I'm comfortable with that risk. I want a little more beta than the SP 500 for a better end of your return. So I'm okay with this. So you can use this tool to assess your overall portfolio. Okay, lightning round some common questions. The first one is I like to sell premium do I have to buy? No, you could do whatever you want. The cool part about selling premium is you can sell premium in counter opposing positions. So you can have short puts that are bullish, you could have short calls that are bearish. Next one, should we diversify across strategies and timeframes? Absolutely. I think we covered that here, but the main reason for that is because different timeframes and strategies will behave differently over their life cycle, which is what you're supposed to pay attention to here. So absolutely. How do I know if I'm diversified effectively? Great question. The first thing we can use is beta weighted delta to make sure that the total portfolio makes sense based on our risk. The second is you can model the total risk of your entire portfolio like I was just showing you here. You",
