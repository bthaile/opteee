    "text": "Hi guys, welcome. We're here with another chat with traders. I'm here with Eric from the ES Invest channel and I will link his channel in the pin comment and also in the description. For people on Eric's channel, my name is David Jaffe and I'm with Best Lock Strategy. I want to go over and we're going to discuss options trading and our mutual experience and common mistakes and things in that nature. This is going to be a very valuable chat. So kindly wash until the end and leave a comment below and let us know any questions that you have and any valuable feedback. I think it will be worthwhile if we started with our backgrounds and Eric if you could also introduce yourself, your channel as I did quickly previously, but introduce like your channel and also your background and then I'll do the same afterwards. Yeah, for sure. This one's awesome. So first off, thanks for putting this together. I really enjoy these kind of conversations. They're always fun to me to explore different approaches and different ideas. So I appreciate you kind of starting the dialogue there, but yeah, my name is Eric. I am 16 year retail trader. I started back in 2007 when I was in high school. Like most people that started trading. I grew up super poor. I had a single mom and I was working a bunch of odd jobs split wood. Worked at a bowling alley, all that",

He's like, you need to look into investing and that that literally that one sentence sent me down a completely different life trajectory. So I started learning about investing. I went up to the library, you know, first read books. Then I started checking out on the computer. And long story short, I came across options after I traded equities for a little bit. And I saw some early success of super fortunate. And I started realizing like, oh, like this can actually make a difference for me. And I kind of kept at it.

But one quotation that I mentioned that I was talking about earlier is do what you can with what you have where you are. And I think that that's something that's incredibly important because it puts you kind of similar to like what Eckhart told me say about like the power of now.

I think that I can talk about like for myself and then I can also speak about like things that I've noticed especially like a Cornell where there were people who had a lot more money than me. I think for me I've always kind of been like someone who kind of walks on the line but sometimes I could like potentially step over it and I think that as I got older then I pull back like I'm married I have children and my wife is like really good she's like the type of person where if she goes to Whole Foods and then my daughter like puts something under the carriage and she doesn't see it she'll like freak out and then go back to the cashier and say she'll like drive back to Whole Foods and say hey you didn't charge me for this. So I think it's just basically like in my own makeup where I kind of I wouldn't necessarily say like I'm like a Rick James like habitual line stepper but in the past like you know especially in high school I would kind of like push the envelope and see like what I could get away with just because I was always",

And he did one with this this girl called bad baby who exactly is imagine she's an only fans model and she's from Florida and she has like 100 million and in the process of the dialogue though you know Caleb was asking her like Florida you know it's a peninsula like what is that even. She didn't know what the word peninsula was and then later on in that conversation he asked her like oh so you like reinvest into the business and she essentially was just like I don't know what that means and I said you're thinking like where did I go wrong I need to start an only fans ASAP because I mean obviously she has good work ethic man because she's made a ton of money.

How about we transition and talk a little bit about like our favorite preferred trading strategy. Yeah I think for trading for me I really avoid the idea of falling in love with the strategy the way that I think about it is I have a toolkit my job is to look at the stock market and figure out the correct tool to apply so what that means is I have a grouping of strategies that I almost always run so like the first one is a covered strangle which for the options traders out there it's very good. Similar to the wheel but I have some pretty specific tweaks that I use with it one of which I always run the short calls at a ratio to the long delta's the second thing is it adds additional cash secured puts out and normally I kind of double dip so I'll have money tied to that trade and then you know I portfolio margins so the broker they don't make it cash secured right so I still have that excess cash available",

Yeah definitely all of them so yeah depending on the strategy so like specifically if I'm trading like box spreads those are going to be an SPX and European options are really important part of the safety of that strategy actually being risk free for the coverage strangle that's almost always in an index ETF I like I WM a lot. And then for the speculative allocation sometimes it's in indices less so unless it's the variance risk premium trades otherwise it's going to be an individual names more often than not. Forgive my ignorance because I know that I've looked at I WM before but which which that's this is at a sector ETF. So it's the Russell 2000 so it looks so 2000 small cap stocks. Okay that's awesome it seems like you have a plethora of like different trading strategies and today I'm assuming that the answer to this is yes but I also don't want to put words in your mouth. Does it vary your allocation on which strategy you use based upon like the implied volatility rank or what VIX is trading at or your directional or your thoughts regarding the future direction of the market. How do they vary based upon like you",

One huge advantage of collecting premium selling options is that especially now where you have short term rates at about five and a half percent you can collect that premium and then reinvest it in short term tea bills or bonds in like three or six months and then you can collect you know five or six percent every single year which just last year you are collecting like post zero so that's amazing and then I'm that spot on.

Yeah it obviously varies quite a bit so if I'm trading variance risk premium strategies those are so if I'm trading like short straddles in SPX or if I'm trading earnings those are all going to be zero to four or five DT. If I'm trading the coverage strangle I have kind of a chart that I use based on just current implied volatility for I WM trending compared to historic volatility and then how far we are off of near term highs but for that it's generally something between two weeks and 30 days something like that in there and then for the ratio diagonals the long leg is pretty much always at least 90 DT. 90 DT. Vast majority at the time 180 plus and then the short legs are typically around 20 DT. Awesome as far as my trading strategy I primarily look at look I have a watch list of about 10 to 15 stocks and then I get comfortable with their recent trading range and then when something I believe is over bought or oversold then if it's over bought then I'll sell a call credit spread that's out of the money if it's over. I'm going to sell the money if it's over bought then or if it's over sold then I'll",

You know during those times I will load up on put options in order to that will protect my portfolio for oftentimes years to come and I know that it is very expensive when you're actually making that trade and buying like SPX that it's like two or three years out but at the same time it provides with protection when the VIX is trading at about 12 or 13 or even slightly higher like 13 or 14 because you know that the VIX isn't always going to be trading below 15 it can go from trading at 12 to 12. trading at 12 to 28 and like literally like two or three days we've seen that multiple times so that's basically my strategy in nutshell and that's actually helped me like during August where the market I think it's",

And I think that a lot of times comes to their own detriment. Like when I was going through the phase of aggressively growing my portfolio, I was very frequently levered, like naked levered, where if the market took a crap, I would have been a huge, huge trouble if I did nothing. But that's kind of the beauty of trading options is when we would inevitably get these kinds of downmoves, there's so many products and so many ways that we can start off setting risk very quickly once it starts hitting metrics. So I agree with you there specifically on the idea of controlling risk. And even if you're levered, right? That's, you can't be levered without controlling risk. Otherwise, you are going to blow up. It is literally just a matter of time before a move happens that you're not ready for and then you are in a giant, giant problem. One of the things I wanted to ask you is you were saying that you're hedging your portfolio with SPX puts and I'm curious why do you use that as compared to something like VIX or like VIX futures or something? I primarily like SPX because it offsets some of the zero and one DTE trades that I make. So from a portfolio",

I actually one part of my strategy which I really like doing is when VIX is trading over 30, I will sell calls on VIX with you know a 30 to 60 day or even 90 day expiration. But in general, I prefer buying the SPX long dated options just because it's something that one, there's a lot of liquidity. Also you can go as far as like five years out and it's just something that I feel comfortable with I've been doing it for a while and maybe it's just a habit. But you can definitely hedge with VIX as well because but also remember that when you are, when you're buying those puts in SPX, there is obviously like a large VIX component because the option pricing is going to be factored in it. The VIX measures the volatility on the SPX.",

The VIX measures the volatility on the SPX. So whether you're hedging with VIX or you're hedging with SPX or SPY, it's extremely highly correlated. Yeah, definitely and that's actually why I bring it up because for people that are buying really long-term protection you know against the portfolio if you're beta-weighting your delta's going with volatility a lot of times again to your point if the VIX is elevated, it's not a great time you're already too late. But if the VIX is not elevated at that point, it's actually I would say a more efficient trade than going with long SPX puts and it's specifically because if you buy SPX puts, let's say SPX is trading at 43.87 right now. And let's say over the next four months it trends up, it trends up, it trends up, it trends up. Now the deductible on your puts are, it's now massive because the distance between where you entered and where it is now is very different whereas that's kind of the beauty if you use VIX volatility if you're beta-weighting your delta's because as you know if you get in when VIX is 15 if the market trends up, trends up, trends up the VIX is still",

So yeah, just throwing ideas out there because I tested both of them pretty extensively and in general I actually really prefer the VIX. So using VIX futures. As far as hedge, okay so that's fine. Okay so VIX futures and you would prefer VIX futures opposed to buying long dated VIX calls like in the money calls. You do either. Yeah, I would argue either it's completely fine.

If you start with in the money calls to your point that will provide the primary hedge but that you can add some teeny options, some kickers that are really far out of the money. There are low extrinsic value anyways, right? So if theta decay is gonna be inherently slower no matter what, days to expiration and being far out of the money. But then those can compound really quickly and they can actually pay out like pretty damn nice in a big pullback. So yeah, I think combining both of those is actually really slick. Those would basically be like lottery tickets, right? Not in this instance so much like they're really a hedge but to your point. Did we, sorry. We just connected. Now let me pause. All right, we got disconnected quickly. You know, I guess Zoom got too excited about us talking about VIX calls but we're back at it.

The other thing you can do that I've gotten kind of cheeky with before and if you wanna be efficient as you can use a levered ETF, the downside of that. But you get via SPX, right? Yeah, exactly.

Not quite that three times, that's the drag you see. So yeah, just another way to do it. For VIXX, by an SVX, I think they actually like reconstituted or recalculated it on like February 5th or February 6th, like 2018 because I remember I was flying to Cartagena Columbia with my wife and then those like, I forget whether it was VIXX or SVX5, I think it was SVX5. It basically like blew up. It went from like 140 to like 12 in like an afternoon in like four hours. So yeah, so yeah, like using those, but yeah, now it's a lot more stable and I think that the drag is less. But I'm definitely going to, I definitely appreciate your thoughts because I know that you've done like a lot of research on the pros and cons of SPX versus VIXX.

They might not even wake up. So the idea of using the... You know, the existence. Especially if VIXX is already elevated, the market can drop like 4 over a week and you can see VIXX not even move at all. It's exactly right. The last year where VIXX is trading like close to 40 and then the market would... Yeah. Yeah. And that's why it's important.

And without investing tons of money on SPX or even SPY. Yeah, and I honestly, I normally turn it into kind of its own little trade.

I wouldn't go crazy with that, but if you, let's say you bought like five in the money calls, you can actually probably sell like a, maybe maximum of 10 with a shorter duration. Because you know that if VIX spikes up, you're going to profit dollar for dollar on the long calls, whereas you're not going to lose nearly as much on the out of the money calls that you sold. So yeah, I definitely would consider that to be ultra risky in the concept of a hedge, right? Because then we definitely would induce upside risk, but as a standalone position, I think that could absolutely work just fine. What are some mistakes that you see new traders make? I think it's two, two things pretty simply. I think the first one is approaching trading as a hobby. And then the second one I think is having busted up expectations. Like we all start with, right? We all want to get rich fast. And that reads typically leads to getting poor fast. It does not work well with the markets. And then definitely I think trading is probably one of the worst possible endeavors to approach it as a hobby. It is nothing but a pretty sure far away to lose money.

So, and I like that you integrated, you know, because like I know that you were talking about trading spreads a little bit in verticals and it's definitely not my go to, but it can be done successfully. And I also like that you integrate ideas of creating a range, right? Because now you're overlaying some discretionary components to it that absolutely can increase our efficacy.

So I'll sell spreads, and then I actually don't mind taking ownership of it. And also, because I will sell spreads on things that I perceive to be oversold, then the implied volatility rank on that specific underlying is actually higher, because the stock has fallen from where it was previously trading. So therefore, I'll collect a little bit more premium. And I would say spreads comprise about like 30 to 40. Similar to you, I will integrate different strategies based upon, like where volatility is, how much credit I'm receiving, et cetera. So I think it's just one of the strategies that I'll use, but it's not something that, but I agree with you, especially during periods when volatility is low, and if you're using regulation team margin, and if you're trading something, which is a pretty narrow spread, then",

    "text": "et cetera. So I think it's just one of the strategies that I'll use, but it's not something that, but I agree with you, especially during periods when volatility is low, and if you're using regulation team margin, and if you're trading something, which is a pretty narrow spread, then oftentimes if you're picking up like 25 cents or 25 for every contract that you sell, and when you factor in commissions, oftentimes it's not really worth doing. So you have to make sure that you have multiple strategies at your disposal. Yeah, I agree with that. And I also, like the fact that you trade spreads semi-descriptionally and directionally also makes a little bit more sense to me in terms of just including a floor, because I see people who trade, you know, the theta gangers, they trade verticals. And I tried to like conceptualize why this would make any sense, because their whole premise is, we're selling premium because it's overpriced and it's high, logical, but then they're buying it. They're buying the very thing that they're selling because it's high, and they're buying something that's too expensive then. So that part confuses me a little bit, but I see definitely more of the way that you're employing it. It's interesting to me. You know, one of my close friends on YouTube, he's kind of against like using any type of discretion in your trading. And I never necessarily understood that.

It's kind of like oftentimes people think that and this kind of goes into what we were discussing earlier, or like on email and we're gonna touch on it in this call as well about like AI and bots. I do think that it is important to have some discretion in your trading, because if you don't have any discretion, then just like you said, you're really not going to be collecting that much premium and you're not going to be able to know when to allocate and when to use different strategies based upon the market condition. So I know that discretionary trading or using different strategies at your discretion can oftentimes be looked down upon, but I think that it's worthwhile. You know, if you have something like, like earlier today, I made a trade on BlackRock because BlackRock, it was trading, you know, at one point it was trading over 900, and recently it's been trading around 670. So I think that selling a put, a vertical credit spread with like a 520 by like 460 is not that bad considering that in the worst case scenario, I can roll that position into a naked if I wanted to take ownership, roll it down",

Well, I also think that's the whole point of you doing the spread, right? Because it includes some sort of risk management inherent because to your point, like if you wanted to, if you were trading it as a cash-secured put, you wouldn't put the spread. You would just trade the cash-cured put, you would make more money, but I think that by you trading those kinds of things that spread at least gives you some optionality.

And I do believe that some of the reasons why people want to remove the discretion from their trading is because if you remove all the discretion and then the trade goes against you, then suddenly it's not your fault. It's the fault of the rules or the fault of the bot, but suddenly you're absolved from any responsibility. Oh, it's not my fault, it's the bot, it's the robot, it's the rules that I programmed it with. So hey, if you want to earn alpha, if you want to make money, then I do believe that taking personal responsibility and owning it and educating yourself and making the right decisions is probably your best way of actually achieving that. And I think what you said earlier before we started recording also holds really true here is like who doesn't want easy money? Who like who do I want easy money? Like that's how it really sounds good to me. So the idea of being able to program rules into a bot and let it go make money for you, it sounds very easy and it's, I think the idea of like these rules based or systems based trading, it's so funny, it's nefarious because it sounds really intellectual. It sounds so smart. Why wouldn't she want to cut out the human emotion? Why wouldn't she want to cut out the variance in your",

Otherwise, I would program the same exact robot, man. Yeah, a few things before we wrap up, I want to talk about zero DTE. I want to briefly talk about, although we kind of already did like AI and bots, but we can touch upon that a little bit. And then you have a very unique perspective which I didn't use to agree with, but now I do agree with about rolling. So I also want to share that with the audience. Can you share with me like your thoughts about like zero and one DTE trading? Yeah. It's a, it's a tricky place to operate. So in short, there are a lot of opportunities in that space. In long, the vast majority of retail traders lose money in that space. And it's not what I always encourage people to check out is SSRN.

However, I always encourage people like, I'm just a dude talking on the internet. You in no way should take what I say as some sort of law. You should look up peer-reviewed work on this stuff. And there is some really, really, really great zero DTE SPX studies on this exact thing. And I have a couple of videos that talk about it, but the punchline is once you get through essentially when zero DTE options were launched, which was what, 11 May, 21 or 22. And after that timeframe, when we had daily expirations essentially, and in that timeframe, retail traders were profitable net fees for about four months. And then once we look both net and gross PL, it's huge down, huge down. So I think that it's an interesting place to play.

Because retail traders have actually gotten okay at integrating aspects of volatility assumptions into their trading, which is positively predicting. That's a good thing.

Rolling to me is, it's fake. It's a fugazia. It doesn't mean anything. I think retail traders essentially deploy it as a way to avert losses. That's a giant behavior of retail traders as loss aversion. And what I try to explain to people is rolling is super simple. We close a trade and we open up a brand new trade. That's what a role is. We're simply attempting to tie the accounting to one another. But none of that matters in any material way. Your broker doesn't care. Your broker includes it because you like it.",

But none of that matters in any material way. Your broker doesn't care. Your broker includes it because you like it. And their job is to perform a service. So they're like retail traders like the idea of rolling options. And sure, it does add some simplicity here and there. I roll options to be very clear. I roll them. But I am under no confusion. That typically when I'm rolling an option, I am closing a trade for a loss. I am realizing a loss. And I'm opening up a brand new one that could overwhelm the loss of the previous trade. But there's a big difference between realized PL and unrealized PL. So yeah, rolling trade, super simple, closing a trade, opening up a new one. I think your video on loss of version and rolling was one of the better videos on option trading that I've seen in all of YouTube. And I appreciate that. I'm definitely going to hopefully I remember to link to that video in the description because it was amazing. I definitely think that rolling has a little bit to do with people is ego where especially when you're selling options and hey, I do it myself. I'm like, oh, you can win up to 98 of your trades.

It's such a powerful way to frame it. But I couldn't frame that any better myself that we should be seeking long. The way that I think about it is the vast majority of successful traders that I know, they might win about 50. If they're good, the idea of these really high win rates is exactly to your point. It appeals to two things. It appeals to ego. And it appeals to loss of version. Because we're scared of losing capital. But what I try to remind people is that I would rather win 51 of my trades, but manage risk well and have a good return than when 90 of the trades and then after friction not have any money to show for it.

And the final thing, which we touched upon earlier, regarding your thoughts for like AI and bots and removing discretion, you know, I echo what you said earlier where I just don't think, I think that everyone wants to make easy money and they want to remove the discretion. They want to remove the decision making process because therefore it's one less decision they have to make because hey, look, making decisions can be stressful and we're all overwhelmed and overworked. But I don't think that right now, now I can't tell the future. So maybe in the future the technology will improve or the, you know, what you can do with building out the bot et cetera, it might essentially improve. But in my opinion, I just don't think that it's worthwhile right now and you made a great point when you said that the outflow is in the discretion and in the decision making process. So what are your, you know, I kind of summarized it but do you have anything to add? Yeah, no, I think you nailed it. I think it's important for retail traders to respect and understand how professionals and institutions operate. But part of that is to clearly understand the difference in our, in our structure.

So one of the big things that institutions and that includes market makers in this kind of parlance is they have a giant leverage benefit that we don't have and we'll never see. And essentially that allows them to offset a lot of risk as they're making books and as they're managing their broader book. And obviously they have much, much, much less friction than we do. So the idea of high frequency trading or arbitrage where we're finding things that are mispriced and then pricing them back in, it's accessible to those people for those reasons. And I actually think it's good for retail traders to try to mimic what's successful. If you want to be good at jujitsu, you should look at what Gordon Ryan is doing and try to pick up something. It's the same thing for retail traders. However, you're not Gordon Ryan, right? So like you have to acknowledge some of the differences between the two. And I think that's important for retail, which is exactly what you were. The idea of like tinkering with and playing with AI or automation parts of your trading is smart.

It's an older one, but it's fantastic. And one of the traits of successful traders is pattern recognition. It's our capacity to look at data long term and come up with different assumptions. And the cool part about pattern recognition is once you do it for long enough, there's a giant subconscious component to it where you look at something and you might consciously be saying, okay, the moving averages are doing this, the linear regression channels are doing this, but your mind is running through the roll index, man.",

If you look through thousands of charts, it's overlaying and looking for patterns subconsciously, which is such a powerful mechanism. A lot of times that manifests itself as, that's the pit of my stomach. I'm following my gut here, something feels weird. Believe it or not, your stomach is not telling you jack shit. That is the subconscious processing part of your mind that is just filing down tons of information and giving you cues that you may or may not realize are there. So yeah, pattern recognition is massive. I think pattern recognition is extremely important in everything that you do. If you look at someone like the Braun James, one of the best basketball players ever, whether you think he's had a Jordan like one or two, you know, he's one of the best. If you listen to him talk, he has the ability of remembering specific plays even from 10 or 15 years ago. And because of that, even though he's older now, he's about like 38 years old, he's able to position himself and make the right basketball decision where even though this physical characteristics have declined a little bit, he's still a top 10 player",
