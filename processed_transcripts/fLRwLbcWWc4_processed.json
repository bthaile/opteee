For people on Eric's channel, my name is David Jaffe and I'm with Best Lock Strategy. I want to go over and we're going to discuss options trading and our mutual experience and common mistakes and things in that nature. This is going to be a very valuable chat. So kindly wash until the end and leave a comment below and let us know any questions that you have and any valuable feedback. I think it will be worthwhile if we started with our backgrounds and Eric if you could also introduce yourself, your channel as I did quickly previously, but introduce like your channel and also your background and then I'll do the same afterwards. Yeah, for sure. This one's awesome. So first off, thanks for putting this together. I really enjoy these kind of conversations. They're always fun to me to explore different approaches and different ideas. So I appreciate you kind of starting the dialogue there, but yeah, my name is Eric. I am 16 year retail trader. I started back in 2007 when I was in high school. Like most people that started trading. I grew up super poor. I had a single mom and I was working a bunch of odd jobs split wood. Worked at a bowling alley, all that",

I had a single mom and I was working a bunch of odd jobs split wood. Worked at a bowling alley, all that kind of stuff like most of us do. And I had a teacher in high school that saw that I was working a lot and he was asking what I was doing with my money because he knew my background. He knew my brother. And I essentially just almost have a saving like I didn't know what else to do. He's like, you need to look into investing and that that literally that one sentence sent me down a completely different life trajectory. So I started learning about investing. I went up to the library, you know, first read books. Then I started checking out on the computer. And long story short, I came across options after I traded equities for a little bit. And I saw some early success of super fortunate. And I started realizing like, oh, like this can actually make a difference for me. And I kind of kept at it. So even when I went to my undergrad, which was very statistics heavy. I started integrating a lot of that. You know what I was doing.

I just kind of kept modifying what I was doing and during that time frame, I came across a retired army guy online actually. That became like a huge mentor of mine. He never asked for anything. He never sold me anything. We didn't care. He literally was just helping me. And it's because I was taking the time to probe him. I was taking the time to learn. And he was willing to facilitate that. So, you know, fast forward. Now I'm 32 and I'm super fortunate. The kind of life that I'm able to live. I pay for my mom's house. I pay for expenses. And this all came from essentially two different people in my life sending me down a very specific path. So that's part of the reason why I like doing these so much because I think the idea of just promulgating good authentic information for people and not asking them for anything is massive because you never know what will click for them.

On the same exact line because I don't belong on a camera. I have a face only a mother can love. I'd not good at anything. Like I'm not good at any of this. But I felt compelled because I had people that helped me anyways. So long story short, all of my marine friends. They were stuck at home. They weren't going on to base because of COVID. So I always talk about impactful things to my life to try to help share information. And I found myself doing these phone calls with my friends about finance. And I was just saying the same shit over and over again. I was like, you got to have an emergency fund. What's an emergency funds, you know, six to 12 months of expenses that. Anyways, I made a couple videos and I said here, watch this video so that when we talk on the phone, it's more productive for everybody, right? So you're not repeating everything exactly.

You mentioned that you grew up very poor. What do you think is the determining factor between. I believe that like mindset and also work ethic is extremely vital between climbing up the social hierarchy and not feeling like you're a victim because you grew up poor. And still having faith in the system that if you worked hard that opportunity, you have value to provide other people, then opportunities will be provided for you.

Newberg, New York. So I'm from the Hudson Valley. I'm literally. I used to have a girlfriend. Okay. So I met a girl. Her name is Danielle in Piquipsy at like a nightclub. And then I used to I used to go to Newberg. Like on the waterfront and she had like a jewelry store there. Her parents there. So I used to. So I used to actually like date her and I would drive like 40 minutes there. So it's a lot of the. It's weird that you said Newberg is some of the gangs from Newberg have actually migrated to Monticello. And now the high school is like significantly like more more dangerous than it used to be. But yeah, so that's actually very, very ironic. So what do you and I remember like the new we used to play soccer for like Newberg against Newberg free academy and they would destroy us like you guys were amazing at soccer like NFA.

So I guess it's even like more relevant like how what do you think separated you because I think both of us know like a lot of people who. They didn't grow up wealthy, but they also had a lot of potential. You know like just they were very smart. If they studied at all they would have gotten a's they might have didn't they might have done naturally well on their SATs. But they still felt like a little bit angry at the world that you know they grew up like disadvantaged or maybe they didn't have like the best clothes or maybe they were picked on a little bit during high school. Why do you think you have like a positive mindset and you've been able to to overcome like you're like where you grew up and growing up for to become the person that you are now. I think it's two things. It's a great question too because it obviously causes a lot of self reflection, but I think the first part is I've never really allowed myself to resign myself to circumstance.

And whatever happens will happen. I will be able to look at myself and say like I did my best and I actually that was one of the things that was super fortunate early on is I got around a good crowd even an NFA which was a pretty I walked through metal detectors every day. It's not a good school. And but I got into all honors classes and it's because like I just wanted to do well. And then it's this kind of innate drive to perform. I am obsessed with performance.

The ideas as all of these people understood my circumstance. They helped me. They helped me out of literally the goodness of their hearts. And I think that that I school mentor of mine I call my stepdad now. He's one he's like I'm so close with him because he changed my whole life. And then that other mentor.

I think the first one is kind of worrying about what I can control and focusing on my own performance so that I can look myself in the mirror and say like I'm confident and comfortable with what I did here.

I I love the quotation from stoicism, you know like Marcus Aurelius and I also subscribe to a bunch of YouTube channels. In a way it's like it's a little bit negative because you're kind of like pondering like sometimes you're meditating upon your ultimate demise. And then you realize that like everything that we do here is not super important. So in a way it kind of brings peace to you when you think that something is so vital. But one quotation that I mentioned that I was talking about earlier is do what you can with what you have where you are. And I think that that's something that's incredibly important because it puts you kind of similar to like what Eckhart told me say about like the power of now. Like with where you are right now do your best with everything you have like with all the information that you have at this specific moment. I do what you can with what you have where you are.

I literally love that like I literally love that and I think that you highlight another really important part which is you know the idea of what the information that you have at that point in time because I look back and a lot of the ways that I've been able to navigate is been due to information injections from people exactly to your point. If that didn't happen who I literally have no idea where I would have landed like I wouldn't have gone to college because that same mentors the one who encouraged me to apply for a Marine Corps scholarship. But wouldn't have gone that route I probably would have enlisted which would have been the best thing I could have done to be honest.

So basically I was behind for about three to four months and then I was on par after that first semester and a little bit of hard work with all the kids who went to like private school or all the kids who went to amazing schools and like Westchester or Long Island. So I think the takeaway is that as long as you maintain a good attitude and you're willing to put the work in even if you go to like a relatively bad high school like Monticello or you know I don't want to like label it but it's not like Monticello wasn't like the best school just like NFA it doesn't have like a reputation for academic excellence when you compare it to like Westchester or Long Island but if you are currently going through that situation as long as you put the work in.

I was just I've always been like very competitive and I was very fortunate to get an investment banking job at intern at Morgan Stanley and then I actually finished you know I finished all my coursework at Cornell in three and a half years because I took summer classes at both Salt and County Community College and also at Pop. And it allowed me to graduate in three and a half years. I then worked at CIBC World Markets in their industrial work and services and investment banking and I don't know why anyone will go into investment banking. It's just like it's such a horrible experience like they treat you so they just burn you out like you would work until two o'clock in the morning and then you're expected to be in the office at 930.

But my first group at CIBC World Markets was really really bad and I was thinking about quitting investment banking but then I switched groups and I eventually did banking for about four to five years and then I was simultaneously working in nightlife as a promoter. And I was always interested in the stock market and probably similar to yourself I gravitated towards like trying to learn technical analysis and day trading which I was never successful at and then you know I was just I realized that option selling options gives you a statistical edge. So then I started trading options and then over time I started learning how to like manage and eliminate the tail risk because even though you can win like 95 of your trades that doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to be profitable if you fall into or if you're unlucky enough to you don't get hit with like a black spawn event like December 2018 February 2018 March 2020 etc. So yeah.

He doesn't really he never really worked out hard and you know he is he's okay like he's like successful he works a capital IQ but he definitely didn't accomplish his goals and he definitely didn't accomplish like max out of his full potential and he's brilliant.

And one quick thing before you get into like more so like options trading in my opinion I feel like like intelligence is vastly overrated I live in South Florida and you can be a multi-millionaire by opening up like your own HVAC company like the HVAC I had people come here to service my my HVAC units my air conditioners etc and I paid them like 700 and I pay. I paid them via cell so you're probably not reporting everything so maybe they report like 200 or 300 but the reality is that if you have a very good work ethic and let's say you don't necessarily enjoy like memorizing everything or you know a lot of the craft that they teach you in high school.

And he did one with this this girl called bad baby who exactly is imagine she's an only fans model and she's from Florida and she has like 100 million and in the process of the dialogue though you know Caleb was asking her like Florida you know it's a peninsula like what does that even mean she didn't know what the word peninsula was. And then later on in that conversation he asked her like oh so you like reinvest into the business and she essentially was just like I don't know what that means and I said you're thinking like God where did I go wrong I need to start an only fans ASAP because I mean obviously she has good work ethic man because she's",

That I almost always run so like the first one is a covered strangle which for the options traders out there it's very similar to the wheel but I have some pretty specific tweaks that I use with it one of which I always run the short calls at a ratio to the long delta. The second thing is it adds additional cash secured puts out and normally I kind of double dip so I'll have money tied to that trade and then you know I portfolio margins so the broker they don't make it cash secured right so I still have that excess cash available and then I'll put that in like box spreads or something right now box spreads pay really well they're like 5.4 annualized returns so it's a way to kind",

And then in the speculative allocation of the portfolio which is kind of exactly what it sounds like that's where I'm going to be a little more focused on seeking specific opportunities and for the speculative allocation that's where I'm going to trade things like variance risk premiums so I'm going to use short straddle strangles iron flies stuff like that and then the other big strategy that I use is ratio diagonals those are my directional strategies it's either going to be ratio call diagonal if I'm both. I'm going to use a very large ratio put diagonal if I'm bearish and those really make kind of the broad ensemble of what I trade if I'm trading volatility expansion I still trade the straddles and strangles typically straddles I would do and I would just buy it.

Forgive my ignorance because I know that I've looked at I WM before but which which that's is at a sector ETF. So it's the Russell 2000 so let's say 2000 small cap stocks. Okay, that's awesome. It seems like you have a plethora of like different trading strategies and today I'm assuming that the answer to this is yes but I also don't want to put words in your mouth. Does it vary your allocation on which strategy you use based upon like the implied volatility rank or what VIX is trading at or your directional or your like thoughts regarding the future direction of the market.

In a nutshell the way that I dull capital out between or allocation and speculative first comes down to I'm going to try to make my primary returns which for the longest time was 15 per year that was my target. And I held that for like 12 years and then over the last four or five years I've been ratcheting it down considerably just because I'm favoring a different return profile for the markets and so. You're trying out to decrease your overall portfolio volatility is opposed to maximizing your return. Yeah that's exactly I'm not really looking to aggressively grow the portfolio at this point kind of content with where it is I'm still growing it and it's actually funny this here was the first year that I guided myself down somewhere between like a six and eight percent return and when I just did my last YouTube live session.

I'm just very cautious and selective on where I deploy but I don't like stop because who knows like next year could be awful so but when I'm thinking between core and speculative if I can make the primary return in my core allocation that's great and I'll run that at the smallest size I need in order to maintain my track to the annual target. And then the speculative allocation really comes down to opportunity if I see opportunity I always keep a portion of the portfolio open to speculative plays but if I see a lot of opportunity coming up I'll open up more of the allocation to the speculative place like if we're going through an earnings cycle for example I have way more speculative trades under in that time frame than I typically would and it's because I need a lot of occurrences in order for variance risk premiums to pay me out of the market.

Definitely the ratio diagonals so and it's the ratio diagonals are funny that way in that they obviously offer you know directional leverage and there's been no shortage of movers this year so I think that that's been a pretty significant portion of it and then also just the prevailing variance risk premiums on this year have been pretty fat at least that's a lot of the factor than we saw last year which has allowed pretty reasonable performance and then the other thing in addition to all of that is you know when I'm trading box spreads now you really you have the ability to double dip money so if I have cash allocated",

And one huge advantage of collecting premium selling options is that especially now where you have short term rates at about five and a half percent you can collect that premium and then reinvest it in short term tea bills or bonds in like three or six months and then you can collect you know five or six percent every single year which just last year you were collecting like post zero so that's that's amazing and then that's that's spot on.

Additionally I do like to sell like one DTE options on the SPX and for the more I am very big on mitigating tail risk and reducing overall portfolio volatility so especially during times when VIX is trading below 15. And I think just a few weeks ago it'll over about like 12 and a half you know during those times I will load up on put options in order to that will protect my portfolio for oftentimes years to come. And I know that it is very expensive when you're actually making that trade and buying like SPX that it's like two or three years out but at the same time it provides you with protection when the VIX is trading at about 12 or 13 or even slightly higher like 13 or 14. Because you know that the VIX isn't always going to be trading below 15 it can go from trading at 12 to trading to 28 and like literally like two or three days we've seen that multiple times.

I think it's extremely extremely important and you hinted at this not to chase maximizing your gains because if you do maximize your gains without taking into account minimizing the tail risk then you're always going to be at the women of the market and if the market's going up then you're going to be doing well. But the if the market pulls back and there's a saying that the bull takes the stairs up but the bear jumps out the window you need to make sure that it all times you're protected against the bear jumping out the window and you don't want to lose all of your hard earned gains. If the market has like a March 2020 because in March 2020 when the market fell I think like 36 in 33 days many people were forced to close out their positions only to then see the market rebound and recoup all of its all of its losses in just like two months.

Yeah and you bring up a bunch of good points I agree with you specifically on the idea of managing risk via size. I think I do think traders get too wrapped up in this idea of hedging and they're afraid of variance and they're afraid of risk. And I think that that a lot of times comes to their own detriment like when I was going through the phase of aggressively growing my portfolio I was very frequently levered like naked levered where if the market took a crap I would have been in huge huge trouble if I did nothing. But that's kind of the beauty of trading options is when we would inevitably get these kinds of down moves there's so many products and so many ways that we can start off setting risk very quickly once it starts hitting metrics so I agree with you there specifically on the idea of controlling risk and even if you're levered right. That's you can't be levered without controlling risk otherwise you are going to blow up it is literally just a matter of time before a move happens that",

I primarily like spx because it offsets some of the zero and one dt e trades that I make so from a portfolio margin perspective it does help with with that additionally with vix because from my understanding of vix it's essentially like a math equation where you know that vix is trading at 30 then it's only a matter of time where it's going to then contract and there's going to be a ball of sody crush more so to the mean. I actually one part of my strategy which I really like doing is when vix is trading over 30 I will sell calls on vix with you know a 30 to 60 day or even 90 day expiration but in general I I prefer buying the spx long dated options just because it's something that one there's a lot of liquidity also you",

I've been doing it for a while and maybe it's just a habit but you know you can you can definitely you can definitely hedge with vix as well because but also remember that when you are when you're buying those puts in in spx there is obviously like a large vix component because the option pricing is going to be factored in it the vix measures the volatility on the spx so whether you're hedging with vix or you're hedging with spx or spy it's very easy to do. It's extremely highly correlated. Yeah definitely that's actually why I bring it up because for for people that are buying really long term protection you know against the portfolio if you're bait awaiting your delta's going with volatility a lot of times again to your point if the vix is elevated it's not a great time you're already too late but if the vix is not elevated at that point it's actually I would say a more efficient trade.

Whereas that's kind of the beauty if you use vix volatility of some sort if you're bait awaiting your delta's because as you know if you get in when vix is 15 if the market trends up trends up trends up the vix is still up 15 maybe 14 maybe 13 right yeah there's always going to be a fork especially like you may be the poor. Floor's going to be like around 12 I mean I've heard the vix has gone below 10 but it's never there for an extended career to time.

So yeah just throwing you know ideas out there because I tested both of them pretty extensively and in general I actually really prefer the vix. So using vix futures as far as hedge okay so that that's fine okay so vix futures and you would prefer vix futures as opposed to buying long dated vix calls like in the money calls. You do either yeah I would argue either it's completely fine it really just comes down to the size that you're trading and you know what kind of protection you're wanting to outlay for. And I also one of the other things that I do talk to people about if you if we do use vix options specifically calls is you can even enhance your risk profile pretty significantly if you start with in the money calls to your point that will provide the primary hedge. But that you can add some some teeny options some kickers that are really far out of the money there are low extrinsic value anyways right so if they did decay is going to be inherently slower no matter what days expiration",

Those would basically be like lottery tickets right. Um not in this instance so much like they they're really a hedge but to your point. Did we like we get started. Now let me pause. All right we got disconnected quickly the you know I guess zoom got too excited about us talking about vix calls but we're we're back at it. Yeah so my question was when Eric was discussing like buying those um so I'm assuming like those those out of the money vix calls and they would essentially act as like lottery tickets is that correct. Yeah it's it's I guess it depends on what we mean by lottery tickets but yeah it would serve as a highly compounding portion of your hedge is the way I would think about it.

You're going to pay you what like a few dollars if that but if you get the move that we're trying to protect against those obviously compound very quickly so they can in a big move they can actually really enhance your overall hedge but to your point I still think the primary portion of that hedge is going to come from the deep in the money because that's going to move dollar for dollar fast. So whenever I'm hedging with something like that I almost always add the teeny options because they're cheap enough and if you can get the compounding they pay for themselves for the next four times you run them but yeah. And then for our viewers if you are going to trade the future I believe that you would have to trade forward slash vix and if you were going to buy the option I think that the preferred way would be to trade vxx is that accurate or. Or am I incorrect for vix futures it depends",

The pros and cons of spx versus vix and I think just without without me like doing a lot of research it just it does make a lot of inherent and intuitive sense where you know that the vix if it's at 15 yes maybe it drops to about 12 but you know it's not going to drop to about like six or seven whereas with the stock market you actually don't necessarily know where the bottom is going to be so you are inherently protected.

That's exactly right. The last year where vix is trading like close to 40 and then the market would yeah. Yeah that's true and that's why it's important it's not like a one size fits all always do this but it is if you're looking for protection it's like the same. Thing right like the best time to get a roof repaired is when it's not raining same exact thing when you're buying portfolio protection. But another advantage that I can see is because of the low cost of vix you can get much more granular where you don't necessarily have to spend thousands of dollars on SPX or even like hundreds of dollars on SPY because vix if it trades at like you know 12 or 13 then it allows you and afford to the opportunity to be more granular and to hedge off some",

Yeah and I honestly I normally turn it into kind of its own little trade like if I'm buying let's say for example deep in the money vix calls. I'll sell short calls against it in vix shorter term time frame. I just keep it at a ratio right because otherwise you get rid of your protection you're fighting yourself but it is a really again easy way to kind of subsidize some of the long term holding costs of it and to your point if we're doing it right we're going like 80 delta plus for super far in the money. Fated decay is small overall theta extrinsic value of the options is small so you don't necessarily have to do a bunch of short call campaigns to cover a meaningful portion of the cost.

Yep that's exactly right so essentially what i'm doing is i'm just turning it into a ratio called diagonal and just using the offsetting delta's the managed broader beta weighted portfolio races. And you know the interesting part of that is because the delta's are so different where you're buying the you're buying the high delta in the money call you can actually sell a little bit more out of the money calls i wouldn't go crazy with that but if you let's say you bought. Like five in the money calls you can actually probably sell like a maybe maximum of 10 with a shorter duration because you know that if it spikes up you're going to profit dollar for dollar on the long calls whereas you're not going to lose nearly as much on the out of the money calls that you sold.

Definitely i think trading is probably one of the worst possible endeavors to approach it as a hobby it is nothing but a pretty sure far away to lose money.

The idea of integrating different payout profiles I think has been one of the most important things and this is actually something i would be fascinated to kind of understand more of your perspective on because when I was trading a lot of vertical spreads.

So and I like that you integrated you know because like I know that you were talking about trading spreads a little bit in verticals and it's definitely not my go to but it can be done successfully and I also like that you integrate ideas of creating a range right because now you're overlaying some discretionary components to it that absolutely can increase our our efficacy but I'm curious what is kept you with vertical spreads versus kind of venturing into other stuff. Well I think that with spreads I actually don't I would choose a strike on the short put side where actually don't mind taking ownership of it. So on one of my accounts I'm using portfolio margin so I could trade a little bit larger and then in the worst case scenario because I'm trading on very highly liquid large cap stocks like Amazon where if I sold a spread on Amazon let's say it's like 90 by 80.

So I'll sell spreads and then I actually don't mind taking ownership of it and also because I will sell spreads on things that I perceive to be oversold then the imply volatility rank on that specific underlying is actually hired because you know the stock has fallen from where was previously trading so therefore I'll collect a little bit more premium and I would say spreads comprise about like 30 to 40 percent you know similar to you I will integrate different strategies. So I think it's just one of the strategies that I'll use but it's not something that but I agree with you especially during periods when volatility is low and if you're using regulation team margin and if you're trading something which you know which is a pretty narrow spread then oftentimes if you're picking up like 25 cents or 25 dollars for every contract that you sell and when you factor in commissions.",

Oftentimes it's not really worth doing so you have to make sure that you have multiple strategies at your disposal. Yeah I agree with that and I also like the fact that you trade spreads semi discretionally and directionally also makes a little bit more sense to me in terms of just including a floor because I see people who trade you know the theta gangers they trade verticals and I tried to like conceptualize why this would make any sense because their whole premise is we're selling. Premium because it's overpriced and it's high logical but then then they're buying it they're buying the very thing that they're selling because it's high and they're buying something that's too expensive then so that part confuses me a little bit but I see definitely more of the way that you're employing it it's interesting to me.

I do think that it is important to have some discretion in your trading because if if you don't have any discretion then just like you said you're really not going to be collecting that much premium and you're not going to be able to know when to allocate and when to use different strategies based upon the market condition. So I know that discretionary trading or you know using different strategies at your discretion can oftentimes be looked down upon but I think that it's worthwhile you know if you have something like like earlier today I made a trade on BlackRock because BlackRock it was trading you know at one point it was trading over 900 and recently it's been trading around 670 so I think that selling a put a vertical credit spread with like a 520 by like 460 is not that bad. Considering that in the worst case scenario I can roll that position into a naked if I wanted to take ownership roll it down to like 460 and then simply take ownership of like 100 or 200 shares",

Considering that in the worst case scenario I can roll that position into a naked if I wanted to take ownership roll it down to like 460 and then simply take ownership of like 100 or 200 shares and I think that from a long term perspective that's not necessarily a bad trade considering that I would be able to take ownership of BlackRock at less than 50 of where some people had previously purchased it. But you know we don't know like BlackRock can fall below 300 but I think that statistically the odds of you know of taking ownership and owning BlackRock at like 460 to 480 that's not a that's not a bad trade. Well I also think that's the whole point of you do on the spread right because it includes some sort of risk management inherent because to your point like if you wanted to if you were trading it as a cash secured put you wouldn't put the spread you would just trade the cash you would make more money but I think that by you trading those kinds of things that spread at least gives you some optionality and to your friends point I find that fascinating because I think without discretion in trading there is essentially no alpha like I don't I don't see a retail available automated trading approach that can produce alpha.

It's such a powerful way to frame it but I couldn't frame that any better myself that we should be seeking long. Yeah. The way that I think about it is the vast majority of successful traders that I know they might win about 50 if they're good. The idea of these really high win rates is exactly to your point it appeals to two things it appeals to ego and it appeals to loss aversion because we're scared of losing capital.

The big your video like I said before was amazing and the biggest takeaway that I took from your video because you really hit hard into like the the fallacy the psychological dependency upon loss aversion. The biggest takeaway that I took away from that video was man I should really be risk seeking I should actually lean into my losses and the trades that I feel uncomfortable about and which are showing me of like a 3x loss of like the credit received instead of hoping that they're going to turn around and that you're going to show me a profit.

I have losing trades very frequently and at no point do I look at them and say this is it for me this is the end and a big part of that is if you're sizing trades efficiently and if you're deploying in a broader system that has positive expected edge in the long run. losses are part of the game it's just it is just part of the journey it's like again if you do jitsu you're going to get tapped out it's going to happen you're going to lose but the idea is to get tapped out quick enough so they don't break anything and then you learn and move on.

You know I echo what you said earlier where I just don't think I think that everyone wants to make easy money and they want to remove the discretion they want to remove the decision making process because therefore it's one less decision they have to make because Hey look making decisions can be stressful and we're all overwhelmed and overwork but I don't think that right now now I can't tell the future so maybe in the future the technology will improve or the you know what you can do with with building out the bot etc might essentially improve but in my opinion I just don't think that that it's worthwhile right now and you made a great point when you said that the outflow is in the discretion and in the decision making process so what are you know I kind of summarizes but do anything to add.

    "text": "you know I kind of summarizes but do anything to add. Yeah now I think you nailed it I think it's important for retail traders to respect and understand how professionals and institutions operate. But part of that is to clearly understand the difference in our in our structure so one of the big things that institutions and that includes market makers in this kind of parlance is they they have a giant leverage benefit that we don't have and we'll never see. And essentially that allows them to offset a lot of risk as they're making books and as they're managing their broader book. And obviously they have much much much less friction than we do the idea of high frequency trading or arbitrage where we're finding things that are mispriced and then pricing them back in it's accessible to those people for those reasons and I actually think it's good for retail traders to try to mimic what's successful if you want to be good at jujitsu you should look at what Gordon Ryan is doing and try to pick up something it's the same thing for retail traders however. You're not Gordon Ryan right so like you have to acknowledge some of the differences between the two and I think that's important for retail which is exactly what you. The idea of like tinkering with and playing with AI or automation parts of your trading is smart I automate parts of my trading I scan that's automation",

The idea of like tinkering with and playing with AI or automation parts of your trading is smart I automate parts of my trading I scan that's automation I plug in rules that apply to my strategy to quickly just run through a bunch of stuff to reduce what I have to look at I automate parts of what I find opportunities. But then but at the end of the day you're the one who is sifting through let's say there were a thousand and then you use a scan in order to narrow down to like 20 or 30 but then you choose what you perceive to be the best like 304 and then you make a trade out of it right that's exactly it and one of the things that yeah one of the prevailing traits of successful traders long term again I encourage you the studies called the behavior of individual investors it's an older one but it's fantastic and one of the traits of successful traders is pattern recognition. It's our capacity to look at data long term and come up with different assumptions in the cool part about pattern recognition is once you do it for long enough there's a giant sub conscious component to it where you look at something and you might consciously be saying okay the moving averages are doing",

If you look through thousands of charts it's overlaying and looking for patterns subconsciously which is such a powerful mechanism a lot of times that manifests itself as that's the pit of my stomach I'm following my gut here something feels weird believe it or not your stomach is not telling you jack shit that is the subconscious processing part of your mind that is just filing down tons of information and giving you cues that you may may or may not realize are there. So yeah pattern recognition is massive. I think pattern recognition is extremely important in everything that you do if you look at someone like the broad James one of the best basketball players ever whether you think he's had a Jordan like one or two you know he's one of the best if you if you listen to him talk he has the ability of remembering specific plays even from 10 or 15 years ago and because of that even though he's older now I think he's about like 38 years old he's able to position himself",

And there's really no difference about what he's doing versus what we're doing is traders where we're looking at patterns we're looking at the best opportunities and then we're acting upon it to hopefully achieve alpha based upon our experience. You literally beautiful summer I completely agree. Awesome. So honestly this was one of the better chats that I've had I think that you're brilliant and I actually didn't know that we grew up in like the same area of the country. Absolutely. I would definitely like to do this again in the future so I'm going to link to to your channel and I'll post this you know probably in around like early September and you know guys definitely follow yes invests I'll link to his channel below. You know and then for Eric's viewers",
