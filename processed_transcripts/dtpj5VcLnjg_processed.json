Great to see you. Yeah, great to see you Eric. Thank you. Of course we had a chance to talk really quick. I heard that you are enjoying the northeastern weather. It's not humid at all or anything like that. Just be perfect. Yeah, typical new England weather. It's in the 90s and I think today they said it feel like a hundred so we're getting our summer weather, you know, but they just wait a minute a little change. I know that's I tell you what that is the good thing about the northeast isn't it is that if you don't like one of them, you just wait a month or two and then it's going to look real different. Yeah, definitely speaking of looking real different, a completely unintended segue, but a perfect one. The last time we spoke, the markets looked quite a bit different than what they do now and I mean realistically in the past week or two, things have started to capitulate pretty meaningfully. So I figured that we could start with a little bit of a gap analysis from your perspective from the last time we spoke about a quarter ago into now. What are the main themes that have transpired from your perspective? Yeah, I think the big one obviously",

What are the main themes that have transpired from your perspective? Yeah, I think the big one obviously is that the economy is showing more weakness. It's showing signs of slowing down and inflation is also trending down. So, you know, we came into this year expecting that first quarter surprise people with higher inflation numbers and everybody went from expecting seven six or seven cuts this year to, you know, more recently, are we going to even get a cut. So I think what's happened in the last couple months is you've gotten softer economic news again and again, I keep stressing this that nothing is a straight line. So, you know, you're not winning your things and so the economy isn't either you're going to get statistics and as well as with seasonal adjustments, it makes it harder to get real numbers. But you're going to have ebbs and flows and all these data and yet, both the street and the Fed tend to, you know, look at this data as if it's a given. Look, inflation is ticking up so we got to go the other way and so they they went from, you know, six cuts or at least that was what the street was expecting six or seven. I can't remember to where",

I can't remember to where the Fed was talking about maybe we won't have a cut this year. Most of them were still talking one or two cuts, but. And then all of a sudden, you know, in May and June, we've had into July, we've had some numbers that confirm that the economy is continuing to slow and moving towards recession, in my opinion, and then inflation is ticking down. You've got that true, inflation number out there, which is a private number that supposedly has had better track record than the government figures and that's coming in at just under the Fed's target of 2. You know, the PC, PCE deflator, which is the Fed's favorite inflation gauge came in at 2.6. So we're not far away and Paul's stressed over and over through the year. And before that we're not going to wait until we get to 2 because by then we've probably waited too long. In fact, he just said that again this past week. So I think that's pretty much telling you you were at the level where rate cuts can happen. I've even said we could see a rate cut in Joel at the July meeting, which is the",

I've even said we could see a rate cut in Joel at the July meeting, which is the last day of this month. You still got two weeks of data to come. So we'll see it's not the expectation of the streets, the streets expecting a September cut. And I think the probabilities there are 80 or 90. Yeah, it's at 100. Yeah, so, but what's the July number? Do you know? Yeah, right now it's showing 6.7 probability of an ease 93.3 probability of no change. Yeah, so that's that's where the street is. I would not be shocked to see a cut. It would surprise, but I don't think Paul's not going to wait until July 31st and then spring it on you. I think the odds are if we're going to see a cut, we'll know it as we move into the end of the month. So, you know, if we get if we continue to get some weaker numbers here, then I think it cut as a real possibility. If we don't get numbers that really say that, you know, they're kind of marking time. Then I think we just wait till September, but you know, again, it's a likelihood is it's a quarter point.

People are, you know, I've seen that narrative around that if they do it in July, it's going to send the signal that they're panicking and something's wrong. You know, the economy is worse than expected or something. For a quarter point cut, come on people, you know, it doesn't matter really all that much. It just would be starting the clock a bit earlier, and I do believe the fed is overly restrictive and that we are running the risk that they've stayed the party too long here on the on the tight side. So, if it were up to me, I would say they should do in July. Obviously, that's not where the street is right now. That's, you know, the fed has not sent a signal to the street that that's likely. But, you know, I think in the next couple of weeks, we could see us build towards that. I would count on it, but I think it's possibility. Yeah, I see your angle there.

Two questions to probe into from a general learning perspective for people. You mentioned that the PCE deflator is kind of like the feds go to tool. Why is that? It tends to be more stable, you know, consumer price index bounces around a lot. So, the makeup of the PCE tends to be less up and less down, you know, not as volatile. So, I think they feel it's a more representative number. You can react to these big swings and, you know, it isn't probably the best thing to do. So, it's just over the years been the one that they feel is probably a better indicator. Yeah, that makes sense. And then the other thing I wanted to ask you about was last time we spoke you had mentioned that you had felt that we might have been getting to the point of being over tightened. And that was about a quarter ago. How do you think we've fared since then and what impact do you think maintaining the current policy that additional quarter and then potentially, you know, another couple months before we do cut. Do you think that that drastically increases probability of some sort of whipsaw effect? Do you think it's like moderate probability?

Yeah, this is an interesting one because there are lots of people out there still saying we don't need cuts. You know, why would they cut? And then you got people like me saying, no, I think what closer to recession than people realize in fact, I would not be surprised at all that when the NBE are the national bureau of economic research who are the official determiners of when our recession starts, they don't really date it until after the fact. And once we're recovery, they'll look back. But I would not be surprised at when they go back that they'll say the recession began before this. So we could have been recession in June even where we're on the verge. I think a recession is, you know, anytime between June of this year and this fall, we may already be in it or maybe just heading towards it. But the problem is leads and lags. And by the time you react to that, if you wait, you're basically a year late, you know, at least eight or nine months late, maybe a year late. So and with the momentum of something, if it",

And then you know, you increase it as you go, you know, you're just you're just stretching out the pain. And if you're if your objective is soft landing, which Paul claims it is and it should be. And you know, you're running a risk when you wait too long that not only is it not going to be a soft landing. That the amount of stimulus required to pull you out of that hard landing is going to jack me on jump up another inflation cycle much, much bigger. So, you know, if you do it kind of right, which is not not probably realistic because the fed number does it quite right. But they did, you know, you're you're easing just as things are slowing down to that almost to the recession point, but you turned it before you got there.

Now, again, it's a quarter point is it going to make a drastic difference whether they cut now or wait till September. Probably not. But if you can get it started now, you might avoid some of the real downside that I think it's coming out. You know, I'm calling for a global bust in the next year. So I don't have a lot of optimism that they're going to manage this correctly, but, but, you know, that's the whole. I thought it. Recently, there was a couple of Fed speakers that were even talking about potentially raising rates. And we saw a few comments of that in the last couple of weeks, which I thought to me looked more like messaging, but I didn't fully understand the comments and why they would come through that way as compared to maintaining the very data driven decision making that really Powell has been focused on.

So I'm surprised to see that. Did you take anything from that? Does it mean anything to you when some of the other committee members say stuff like that? Well, I will say there are, you know, different voices on the FOMC. I truly enough said this to you before I truly believe Powell and I think same thing pretty much for all of the FOMC members. I think they're straight shooters. They are giving you their their view of things and rightfully so there should be different views or what you don't want is group things. So I can understand. I don't agree with it, but I can understand the narrative, the concern for those people is if we don't get inflation down and get it down for good or you'll get it down to a level where it's really been taken care of. We run the rest that we ease prematurely and inflation heats up quickly and we're going to have a harder time second time getting getting the GD back in the bottle. So I get the sentiment I think they're wrong. I think because of my 50 years of watching cycles and watching the Fed. History tells you the leads and legs are longer than they realize",

History tells you the leads and legs are longer than they realize and that they you know they react too slow and and it ends up being elites to extremes of boom and extremes of bust. So I also think there is when they admit it or not there is a little hangover effect of worrying that hey we were we were slow to tighten the last thing we want to be is too soon to ease you know we don't want to be criticized that we let inflation get out of hand again. So I think they're fighting the last war a little bit those that are worried about that. Now Austin Gulsby is the one that gives me most confidence that he understands that you know you're right on the verge of waiting too long if you haven't already gone too far. You know he's he's careful not to kind of go against the chairman or go against the narrative that's out there right now from the Fed. But if you read between the lines I think he is one that's growing concerned that they can't wait much longer.

Now when you look at the way that the Fed is likely to navigate this going forward now that we seemingly are getting closer to a cut what's your expectation for how that goes and how the market kind of flows with it. Let's put this way I do think you're probably going to get three cuts this year at least so in other words if it happens in July then you get July and September and you might get a couple more if it waits till September you might get one July and November and December so I would not be surprised to see at least three cuts this year. I don't know whether they're going to be quarter to point cuts or whether they'll start with a quarter and then have to move to a half because things are getting rockier.

We can start now so I think FETE's or the anticipation of the end of fed tightening and then followed by FETE's is a big reason why we're we're seeing this thing move up because it allows investors particularly institutional investors to start looking over the trough and start raising earnings estimates for next year and the year beyond. Because if the Fed is easing the windows that have not the economies back and you have a better economy and therefore better earnings that's that's essentially what's really going on now with that comes obviously the anticipation's already started in terms of",

It doesn't matter whether the Fed cuts or not because the bond market's going to do the cutting bond market's going to do the easing whether the Fed gets it or not the bond market's already seeing that we need to ease that's why rates have fallen from you know 5 last October. To 417 now you know they went from 5 down to 380 back up to 470 and now we're down to 417 on a way below that 380 at some point in the next month but I think so so rates are coming down because the street does it in the aggregate not individual strategist rain buddy but the street in the aggregate aggregate and the bond market in the aggregate",

So that low rates obviously stimulate some activity it'll help housing it'll help auto sales etc and with rates I think coming down a lot more from here I think that will be some buffer against the slow down we're getting right now. Even though I think a hard landing is coming in the next year it's possible that we get an ambient flow here where it looks like things are going into recession and all of a sudden because of you know the drop in rates you get a little bounce in housing a little bounce in auto sales and the next month's numbers look better so it's not going to be a straight line into a trough field or a straight line into a recession it can bounce around because there are offsetting things going on in terms of policy.

Up to three almost there's only four meetings left this year so my timeline wouldn't work well in that case if especially if we skip this coming meeting so I assume I'm obviously much smaller scope than you so the reason why I've arrived at that conclusion or at least the current hypothesis is just from Powell's messaging but obviously you're able to kind of look beyond just what he's saying and you're looking at the at the end of the day. And you're looking at the activity of things so do you think that the rationale for Powell potentially doing these excessive cuts is he would prefer these smaller cuts see how they feed into the system but kind of maintain progress and how would that differ then if he did a cut wait a month doing or wait a cycle do another cut. Yeah I obviously don't have any real insight into what really is going to happen but but I'm my assumption is or the or the reason I think it's possible I'm not saying it",

I think you could by the time you get to the fall be dealing with the fence say hey we're behind the curve ball we've got to get going or behind the ball we've got to start catching up so and I have no like I said before I have no idea whether it will be three or four quarter point cuts or whether if things start to accelerate to the downside he says okay the first cut is a quarter but then we get to the next meeting goes we need to be talking about bigger cuts because things are going to be very close to the bottom of the ground.

Do I know that the bust starts before the end of the year or really next I don't know that I think that's the best timing I can have is to say if we've started a recession already or we're about to get into a recession then that recessional ultimately morph into a bust where the recession start to getting worse and that triggers some big financial problems you know bank failures and things and I'm just guessing it's going to take us several months to get there. So I'm saying towards the end of this year or early next year you know you could start the bust and there's no you know a recession you can go back and date a global bust my definition of bust is just it's an extreme recession right but",

So I'm saying towards the end of this year or early next year you know you could start the bust and there's no you know a recession you can go back and date a global bust my definition of bust is just it's an extreme recession right but it's a recession that's accompanied by a financial crisis unlike any we've seen before so that's why I call it bust we haven't had a bust in the post world or two eras 2007 eight was pretty close to one but I think that's the best timing for a bust. I don't think we really quite got there so I'm calling for something financially that's worse than that meaning bigger bank failures bigger crisis in the financial world and I'm not talking about the market I'm talking about you know the financial sector of the economy and so do you know it's hard to say exactly when that's going to happen. But I do think there's a pretty good chance it happens you know sometime after the election probably and between then and sometime in the first quarter of next year and then I think it happens fast it's accompanied by what I'm calling an 80 bear market so peak to try off an 80 decline in the indexes which means most everything is going down if you have 80 down in your indexes there's not many stocks that are going to be holding up right so. So I mean",

I wouldn't call leverage catalyst I think it's the reason why it worse and why it is more extreme I see and it certainly it will be why we have the magnitude of the kind that we have catalyst could be a lot of things catalyst could be you know bank fails here overseas and starts a domino effect. It could be it could be an assassination it could be you know all kinds of things that can start the process but ultimately I think it's the process itself that and and also from a market standpoint you reach top and then you know what determines why it tops and goes the other way it may be policy to some extent and it",

But based on the way that you describe the global bust to me it doesn't sound too organic it sounds like something that 80 to your point is something we haven't seen essentially post war two so I find it fascinating I get the idea of a market top I get the idea of natural pullbacks like you're talking about but for a natural pullback to then turn into this depressive events I don't know if you go as far as calling it a depression it seems like 80 crushed earnings probably a decent duration that we might spend there so I guess to maybe reframe the idea to try to understand better when you look at the concept of us potentially hitting a market top starting a pullback when in your mind does it turn from pullback into this global bust. yeah okay so while you're mixing things because I'm okay I'm putting it all the time keep the bust entirely bust refers to economy so bear market when does it turn",

I see it makes a lot of sense and yeah thank you for kind of just offering a glimpse into what you're looking at totally understand the point of focusing on what's in front near near term being more of the the expansion phase I think understanding a little bit about what you're looking at and what you just shared there is actually even that very helpful because you offer a wide array of things right you didn't come back and say this is the only kind of thing that I see that could cause this it sounds like a very broad potential that can be kicked off by several factors which even that in and of itself I think is quite informative actually. Yeah I'm pretty clear that I use a shorthand formula and say the global bust is caused by over leverage heavily over leveraged system plus a fragility in the system in the economy and again this is global so it's not just here but that was caused by the pandemic I think we've gotten away from the pandemic far enough and obviously have a tremendous full market that's easy to forget that there's still a lot of hangover effect from that pandemic you know there's a lot of small businesses that are hanging on by a threat and many others that aren't hanging on anymore there's you know",

Yeah I think there certainly probably people out there that believe that this rally this week is a Trump rally I don't know that I mean I'm because of my view that this was coming and I saw this I mean I was getting two weeks ago I was getting day by day people coming in saying you're crazy your your Russell forecast of 3300 is never going to happen you know the Russell is going down not up and every day they you know the same people. I talk them off the class off the ledge and they come back the next day because the Russell was down a couple points again and they come right back and say there's no way the Russell is going to rally you know what are you talking about what you know it's all it's a it's a crummy.

Trump was you know shot at so so I get hard for me to say the rally this week because technically it looked like it could be coming it's hard for me to say this is a you know it's the result of Trump but I think there's possibility that some of this is people seeing that the odds are increasing that we're going to have. Trump in the White House instead of Biden and it's a more pro capitalist policy so you may be getting some of that on Wall Street but I really don't think that's the big story whether it's this week or not it's not the big story of why I think we're going to 7000 I've said pretty consistently starting last year and into this year that my forecast has zero to do with",

I don't even know even though it's an election year and that you can look at election year statistics and stuff I don't really think that what we're seeing has much to do with the election and I'm you know quick quick quick quick clarifying question on that sorry the I just want to explore the inverse inverse causal relationship so not so much the election having in or this the election essentially causing this scenario but I'm not sure if you're going to be able to see that. So I think that's a very important scenario but do you think that there's any sort of impact that the election can have on the severity or the magnitude of what you're seeing or expecting. I don't think so like I said my targets have been in place in our in place and they really aren't factoring in that now that's not to say you know we're living in a crazy world you know there's been one assassination attempt and there's there's reasons to wonder what you're saying.

Yeah well first of all I the metals have begun a very big run it's been a long time coming I took a lot of abuse as a bowl on the metals for a long time but gold broke out about 2100 many many months ago and as you know I reached up plateau and corrected from there is now another run I think we're going to 3000 pretty quickly in gold the next few months silver is farther back from its all-time highs you know gold is at all time highs but silver is got to get through a lot of various levels of resistance so it's it's got longer ways to go but I raised my target 75 on silver and I think it's you know it could it could spill into the next year but I think it's potentially a 2024 target. So that's a long way I mean where you know where are we 31 and change on silver so you got a big run there and the miners obviously will will company that so",
