    "text": "what's up ape outliers today is a video specifically for you it's all about GameStop because I mean we got a breath of fresh air we got a little bit of movement going on so obviously we have to dedicate all of our effort into analizing what's going on because man am I stoked to see these two consecutive back-to-back days today up over 8 in an individual day which again for GameStop got to keep it a buck that's on the smaller side but I I'll take take it I will 100 take it right now cuz if we took a look at the 5day average daily range at 6 the 20 days 4 so I mean this is even outperforming the average true ranges intraday so something is going on here so let's figure out kind of what's Happening Here the first thing that I have to point out is take a look at that volume 15.5 million shares that is against the 20-day average of 5.7 in the 5-day average of eight which includes this other outsized day yesterday so it looks like there's a bit of heat coming into this and again if I squish this all the way down I can see the volume bar right there so it's really nice to be able to see it poking up because it's competing with all these giant volume bars from the previous squeeze and we can see it though so I am very happy about that",
