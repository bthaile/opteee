Man, that's like a really profound spike. And it ran all the way up until on the eighth, it ran all the way up. And then on the ninth, it dipped down pretty hard. So on the eighth is when we saw a really serious acceleration here. So let's see what's going on. A lot of near term activity, that is very easy to see. What I would like to look at is the distribution of a Y, which I can't right now because this is not working, but we can take a look at that tool. Current ally. So across strikes, it looks like broadly calls running on the 13 and a half. 13s, it looks like kind of calls you along most of the out of the monies. And then for the out of the money on the downside is when the puts start to pop up. So there is some standard hedging behavior going on in here, which is always interesting to me, especially in names like this, where it seems like there can be just such dominant upside expectation. So to see this kind of distribution is not like super remarkable, but it is semi-remarkable to",

So to see this kind of distribution is not like super remarkable, but it is semi-remarkable to me. Now looking at expiration based, the front expirations are very, very call heavy. And then it kind of remains call heavy. Not until you get way out here until June that you start to see the puts put side picking up, but it still doesn't exceed the calls. Not until you get way further out until like October. So yeah, I mean, the OI skew seems really, really centered on the call side. One quick admin note, if anybody else in the chat has think or swim, if you can periodically try logging on and then let me know if it eventually lets you on. So then I can restart mine. But let's take a look at this next. So what I'm doing here is I'm getting a sense of total volume. We can get a sense of total volume across strikes and across expirations. So right now we're looking at the call side of the equation. And all I'm doing is getting a sense of where it seems to be the most dominant. And you can see it's done by a heat map. So it's pretty clear. The front expirations are just absolutely the mass of what you",

The front expirations are just absolutely the mass of what you see. And it's literally like from Friday into next week. A lot of this volume on Friday is likely front expirations that are being moved out because it didn't hit, you know, the profit targets that were going. Right. So you can see that pretty heavily here at the 13s and the 13 and a halves and the 14s of the at the monies. So this just to me, I imagine a lot of this like 11k is coming from this 21k, meaning people are closing out of these moving out to these same thing with this. So what that generally tells me is people are just looking to maintain exposure. Like that's in a nutshell what that means to me. Now let's take a look at overall premium at the monies. Yeah, I mean, nothing. What I'm looking for here, by the way, is like any distance spikes. I'm looking for anywhere that I can find like really, really strong premiums, which I don't I don't really see it looks. Yeah, I mean, it looks pretty at the money centric. Okay.

I am affiliated with them, but it's because I like legitimately like the tool, but there are absolutely things that this cannot do that toss can for me, which is why hopefully we can get that to turn on. But that aside, let's take a look through just recent transactions. This is always good to get a sense of institutional sponsorship. And it's like super slow. Like that's what I see here. It looks like this homey Kelly. I have no fucking idea how you say this. Many guesses, any phonetic Spellers know how to say this. I know that's going to be like lock. Ock. I'm not going to sound that whole thing out. But they've been selling for a little while. But I mean, it's not like big and they're not really that large of a holder.

What does sponsorship looks like? Oh, interesting. So it looks like the total net change in ownership hasn't been. It's not as it's not as sponsored as I would have thought from an institutional lens. What's the total? I assume this is the number of the number of names. What I would like to see is the total percentage. It's always a good metric and I don't see that in here. It actually seems build out. I was trying to get a sense of scale. What is their current total institutional ownership? You guys know I can look it up if not. Take a look at so far. Let's go to maybe inside. No. I'm just going to look it up. So far institutional. This is normally a good source for this is through Fintel. Except it's not loading for some reason. Why do. Is it just my internet that's being absolutely awful today? It's just fine.

It's a really useful metric because it gives you a lot of insight. Is to whether or not institutions are looking to continue to expand into something and consume more of it. But then it also gives you a lot of insight into how much something can move. Because what happens is as institutional ownership goes up and up and up. It decreases the amount that something can move around because a lot of the shares become locked. So if we take a look at some of like bigger, bigger tech names like Microsoft, you can see it's 72.2 institutionally held. So what that means is if Microsoft wants to have some sort of big kind of move. It's more difficult when more of it is being held on to by different kinds of institutions, ETFs. This is where you get into the really interesting world of structural trading opportunities within the market. And it's because you can come up with inferences off of stuff like this.

And it's because you can come up with inferences off of stuff like this. So now if we go back to SoFi like we were just looking at, notice the institutional holdings and SoFi comparatively. Right significantly less. So when you see things with lower institutional ownership, it means that the volatility tends to be higher. And it's because it changes hands more readily. As institutions start to scoop up shares, they're slower to move things. Especially again, when it starts getting picked up by ETFs and stuff like that, like spy is not moving much of its Apple holdings. It'll rebalance it and that will cause some of the movement. But that's about it. It's going to maintain the overall target exposure. So just something to be aware of when you look at this stuff and that's why I think that would be a great tool to have here is like not just volume, but literally a net institutional ownership view because this looks like total holdings here. This is only showing 772. This looks like the number of companies, which isn't like the number of come. Okay, cool. Like there's nothing wrong with knowing that.

Oh, these are like different earnings stuff. Overall profitability metrics. I don't really care about that. Squish all that down. Let's take a look at insiders here. Wow, heavy in the options markets from an insider lens. I think that's some. What's the short interest? 13 and a half light. That's really, really light short float. Do not really going to get a ton of movement on that kind of thing. Yeah, it's just not enough from a from a short holdings perspective. Cool. Let's see if there's any interesting options positioning. Want to look through a couple of the things. This one of the reasons by the way, why I'm going through all this with so fires because I don't necessarily track so fires closes other names. So what I'm doing is I'm building just an overall understanding of like the recent movements in it.

And then this is just telling me what the overall options activity looks like from a float perspective. Calls to puts and this is looking at it in terms of volume. Again, I actually don't care to look at it by volume out right. I prefer something like this to be by premium. And the reason is because you can uncover some really big low volume trades that are very high premium. So and we did this recently in GameStop with those short puts that were in the money. That's like a prime time example of that. So yeah, I don't care about this. That's looking at an individual option. I don't care about this stuff. Okay. Let's take a look at an actual chart. I don't need the. So on a three month timeframe. I mean on a three month timeframe, this is. Not. Not really looking that great. I'm just going to add a couple basic studies really quick.

Make sure that the longer term ones are exponential for sure. And then we'll add another one that's shorter term. We'll do a 20 period. Perfect. And then we do one more. That's a really short term like a 10 or a 9. And see the relationship here. So the reason why I like moving averages for this is you don't need to put a ton of shit on this in order to get use information. Another one that would be really good though is a volume profile. If this thing has that. It does. Volume profile is a super super super useful tool. And it gives us a ton of information. Yeah, so I'm actually really really happy that they have this. I like to make it a little less. That's good. Beautiful. So the volume profile I care about this because it gives me really important context on what the overall behavior has been in the name. So when we're looking at something like so far, here's a few key things I can tell you that there's some really important volume nodes here at like the 1564 handle like",

And where we're transacting now is like a moderate shelf around this volume node, but not the biggest volume node. So now what this objectively tells us is it lets us know that as so far might rally, it is very likely to start running into overhead resistance once it gets up to this like 483 handle. That's what you're seeing. So it's like pretty high probability. Now that doesn't mean it can't break through it as hopefully you know the vault support and resistance it's supported resistance until it's not right. So you don't like read way too far into that. But if we zoom this in now and we kind of get to a more relevant time frame. So this is looking at the last what four months. And I think this. And it has. I just want a line, bro. What the fuck? If you guys needed an arrow, I now know how to draw in a noxiously large arrow. Can I delete that? That's great. What does this thing do? Don't want that. I literally just want like a trend line.

You could live there. So. I think that's a good thing. Overhead resistance 425 for sure. This is like absolutely the bulk of the volume node that we're going to see. I think I mean, from a near term price perspective, you are seeing at least a near term rally. And you can see that noted by the higher local highs and the higher local lows. What a great vibe is the fact that it tried to pop up here. And then it got pushed back down right. It's starting to run into this volume node. And one of the things you'll notice is as we zoom in, you'll get a better sense of different volume nodes.

Because that's what this is, right? If I zoom out far enough, I can see exactly where a bunch of people started phasing into the position and they're in a bad spot. So for example, this is going back again to January 24. So if I zoom this out, notice how that bar is going further and further up. What that tells you is that there's a ton of people from January 24 and before that are buying at these really high levels. And then you don't see those people go away until we get like pretty far out in time until we're back in November before the key breakout that it had. So what this tells us is that there is a not small group of people actually the bulk of trading volume had entered in near the tops here. So then often this is when that group starts to say to themselves, do I want to be in this name? And that's a tough question because they then need to essentially figure out what they're going to do is it rallies up. But this is",

And that's a tough question because they then need to essentially figure out what they're going to do is it rallies up. But this is where a lot of people will start to unwind now going back to the point that we learned earlier about the importance of understanding institutional ownership. If this was 80 institutionally owned stock, what do I think might happen as it gets up to this 510 handle realistically, not a whole lot. And it's because institutions typically are less interested in actively cycling by and sell. But because we know this is like less than 50 institutionally owned, that means that there's not an insignificant number of individual people holding this small shops stuff like that that are going to be quite eager to get out as it hits this. So in those cases really all it tells me is that there's likely to be a fair number of people that are eager to get out of the name when it gets there. That's that's exactly what I would expect to see. Cool. So now from an options, why can't I delete this? Dude, this is so funny. Every time I mean it's fun learning different tools that's cool and all. Maybe if I double click it, nope. Y'all, if you guys have any tips or tricks, there it goes.",

Okay, okay, this ain't bad. So I have Greeks. We do have Greeks. We even have Charmin Vanna. That's actually sick. Good. Where's theta? Why the fuck would theta not be on this list? How does that make any sense to anybody? There it is. Where the fuck is it? Oh, I might just have to scroll. I just got to get rid of some of this extra shit. We'll get rid of the high low. Don't care. Average last is fine. Plus minus is fine. There's theta. Beautiful. Okay, cool. So let's see. What I'm doing now is I'm just getting a sense of what the options chain looks like and I want to get a sense like relative to different delta's. So we obviously need to go out into next week.

What's the IV skew? So the IV skew on the 39 delta is 56 and on the 41s it's 56. So there is a little bit of call skew, not like super heavy. So after like a quick poke through of so fine tinkering with some different tools just to get a fucking feed under me with using this thing compared to think or swim my usual. It looks like there's bullish call flow and positioning expectations, but they're really like right now price is not behaving super well relative to that in my opinion. So with these kinds of things I normally would look at it as if we see it starting to break above key resistance. Then I'm immediately immediately more interested. But with it behaving like this now it effectively needs to get over like this handle for sure. So this is the 1375 handle. But the way that this can be played is for me the way I would play it is this becomes near term resistance. The bottom of these candles the congestion of these moving averages those kinds of things. And the way that that gets played is stop goes below there. So stop goes somewhere around like 1240 something like that. And then",

With the expectation of high probability of being stopped and then scale into it if it starts to have that up move which is from the options markets it does look. It does look like it wants to go that route but you need the price performance really to to support it. So yeah I mean you can see where the pinning is. Which it was just north of Max Payne. Oh, fun look. It does look overall. I mean it does look like it's overall being positively positioned right take a look at the net call flow. The problem is and this is a good example of how options flow is not omnipotent.

Innovative strategies leverage institutional investment expertise to implement proprietary strategies for Bitcoin accumulation and QL. Including acquiring cash at a high discount through mergers and utilizing fixed income and deliveries. This is interesting because I also imagine that micro strategy isn't necessarily going to be ultra stoked on this because this isn't exactly what micro strategy is doing. So there are intelligent leverage, which is fucking Spanish for Ponzi scheme, but this isn't that far off in terms of their broader goal of accumulating Bitcoin like that part I totally get.

Well, this is interesting like a Bitcoin treasury company in the gaming sector. So expands on what this potentially would look like. Allocating maximum cash reserves to Bitcoin. This is. I mean, this doesn't make sense. To be honest, this this to me strikes me as like a Bitcoin maximalist that is just trying to get more sponsorship of Bitcoin. That's genuinely what I believe. I like Bitcoin. I think it's a really interesting tool. I think it has valid use cases and it's proven itself and it's starting to expand in adoption. All of that stuff, I think is unequivocally the case. However, that being said, GameStop as it sits today still has brick and mortar stores.

It's not like this move that you get to focus on only when we're talking about something like getting into Bitcoin. It's more talking about this. So 29 drop. So that has again, if a lot of your capital is in Bitcoin, that's not an insignificant drop. Let's just eyeball it really fast. A lot of fucking zeros to type in.

Shows us any signs that they knew that this was going to happen before it happened. No options so that answers that damn that would have been kind of fun. Okay so section 351 allows non recognition of gain or loss when a properties transferred to a corporate solely in exchange for stock and the transfers are in control of corporation immediately after the exchange. That's cool. That's really cool. And this was the other follow up we had asked. Being a Bitcoin treasury in the gaming sector. So it says game stop could move material portion of cash. Into Bitcoin. Okay but then what establishes the companies of forward thinking crypto aligned brand why I think they already have that with the recent offering. Crypto integration and gaming products.

It's it's not here yet it's not at the point where people are wanting to make a bunch of like basic smaller level transactions with Bitcoin. Because it's expensive on a relative basis it's way too slow still. And a big part of that is because obviously you need the confirmations. And it's not like using a credit card where the credit card company is effectively saying we're going to pay you no matter what and then we'll deal with this person on the back end if they need to. There that doesn't exist for a bit coin just yet so I think for Bitcoin to be widely adopted is like a payment mechanism like that you really need. Easier spending infrastructure for which just doesn't exist yet. Lightning network for micro transactions like this makes sense. I think this would make a lot of sense if it's actually scalable and accessible. It's just not right now. Let's see the emphasize retail stores I think that makes sense. Spent off physical assets.

What do we get into towards the beginning? Seven eight. Yeah. I'm going to go to the bottom. Well, we're the Delta on these. The in the money delta is an interesting choice. So by going further in the money, you get a better delta move. They're more expensive, but there's also the hedging requirement. Now, these are still 40 days out in time. So there's not a massive hedging concern like upfront because you still have time. But that's one of the reasons why going in the money can be interesting, especially for shorter term ideas. Is because you start to force that hedging behavior, even if it's not inherently at like the ideal time, but to get them to start putting on. Share hedges to account for potential assignment. Or exercise, I should say, because these people would be along these options. Super interesting. I be says huge risk to be long calls on GME. Not really. I actually don't agree with that at all.

I think like any other options chain, it really depends on the way you choose to structure your position. But I mean, I've already shared it before, like from a coverage triangle perspective, GameStop is the second best performing coverage triangle in the portfolio. It's the first best in terms of how much money it has. But that's just because of the volatility. So being long options and something like GameStop can tear your face off. If you're over sizing or if you're like putting on stupid positions, you're going to let your money on fire. But there's nothing really that forces you to do that. You can absolutely put on smart trades. If you're so inclined, which can work really, really well in something like this because of the volatility. So yeah, I don't really see it as super risky at all. I would be curious as to why you view it that way. Now, if we take a look. I'm just waiting this up a little bit. So we've been oscillating sideways in here for some time now. There's a really, really strong volume node that's built. And we can also see that again, we have this plotted in think or swim.

So this has us at like the 21 10 handle, just like the sub 20. So if we zoom this. Can you grab the access you can great. I'm just pulling the squeeze out of here so that we can see the near term price behavior. So you can see that there is some price activity down here, sub 21. But you can see before you get to 21, I mean, we really are in just the meat of overall volume and overall transaction volume. So the way that it's behaving lately, at least for the way that I trade GameStop is been more so from just premium perspective selling puts. So I always maintaining high ball. And I'm not seeing the prevalence of the call skew. If I saw a higher prevalence of call skew, I absolutely would buy shares and sell calls or sell naked calls with the intent to buy shares set essentially order. If it starts to move up too much.

We'll do the 29 delta. And the ball on this side is 91 for 29 delta. And if we go to a 29 delta on the put side that puts a summer rate around here. The ball is 73. So that's actually the biggest skew that we've seen for a while. That's still I mean, that's a bigger skew than I was expecting to see. That's like a 20 point skew. That's significant enough. Now, if it's actually trading, there is another story because we do need to see like what the bid and the offer is. Where is that. bid as is that volume. I don't like the way that. Yeah, it's the biggest volume. Where's like the fucking market. Normally, I want to see bid and ask. What I'm trying to do is see how liquid it is. Anyways, that's still I mean, that's decent enough.

This is the exact scenario that I'm talking about. And with the ball skew that strong, if it does remain to be this strong, I absolutely would take some of the short puts down by shares and then sell calls against it to take that call skew. And then what I do to protect to the downside on that kind of position is the game plan will be really simple. Well, can I look at a chart? There you go. The only thing that's really simple is that the only thing that I do is set alerts to essentially get stopped out below near term resistance. And I would just do it near the break even for the short calls. Maybe you know, a little bit edge on it. But that's exactly what I would do. So this is we'll see how it actually behaves on Monday.

As you can see the difference between all time and last year is striking. The above decimals are called correlation coefficients go up to one. There's a lot with this though. So one of the problems with the way that they ran this study in this way is that they're missing some really, really important behaviors. And it's you need to create a benchmark without a benchmark. This really isn't that useful because depending on the year. And what this is saying is this is the last year. This was written in June. Seven of 2021. What happened in the last year during this time frame where this was analyzed anybody remember. A little something or other that happened during that time frame. The reason why this is important is because the next question I'm going to ask you is what kind of impact do events like the thing we're talking about. Little something that happened in that time frame. What effects on correlation do those kinds of events have. Talking about COVID COVID happened in 2020.

It's going to have to clean it a little bit because there's some metadata in there. But. I think you'll get the you'll get the just when it pops out. So anyways, we'll continue. So as you can see, all of them except for NAKD and not have strong correlation. GameStop. What really struck me was the VIX because the market usually goes down when the VIX goes up. And the fact that GameStop and VIX have such a strong correlation in the past year is extremely important for our thesis that HFs are actively acting against it. That's a bummer. If that's a big part of the thesis that's not really a good. That's unfortunate. Yeah, I'm Daniel. Anyways, let's continue. Carpload takes OTC data from Finra plots it for each of the meme stocks. How they seem to follow pattern of spiking FDD cycle. Okay. This I think is one of the initial cycle analysis. DDS, isn't it? That's what this looks like to me from 2021. Weasers are extremely rare.

They're actually not to be honest. How rare are short squeezes in the stock market. And we'll see how it answers that broadly. So the correlations for those other names. So Chevron during that time frame was a point four, which is huge for Chevron at that time. Pfizer was a point five eight. Tesla was a point seven. So what I'm showing you is a bunch of these correlations during that time frame, especially through 2020. Is that just about everything became massively correlated. Let's see. Less than half a percent of all stocks exhibit the classic squeeze characteristics in any given month. I think that's correct. Definitely because there's a bunch of stocks. It was like 6000. So I would imagine it's a very small minority for sure. And then it says only 10 to 20 stocks per year see major high profile squeezes with three to five times moves in a short time window. Yeah, I think that's a that sounds right. So for me, at least I wouldn't consider that extremely rare. It's rare, but it happens monthly effectively. It's just. Not like this super widespread effect.

Yeah, let's take a look. FDD cycles the idea that because I see regulations require market makers to cover FDD's 35 calendar days. There's a predictable increase in price and volume every 21 ish trading days or 35 calendar days. So far it has continued to repeat itself the idea that shorts are in so deep that they're doing some bare minimum to cover to continue doing sells a deeper hole by kicking the can on the road. Currently increasing exponentially, which indicates that it's getting more and more expensive to stay in the game. Okay. Orange line represents FDD cycle increases by each month. I want to know how they got that into think or swim because that to me looks like they're just doing like a time based thing. Yellow lines or FDD cycles.

Right, like this cycle, it went down this cycle, it really didn't do a whole lot. Even with this green candle, it's about flat from where it was. The other thing is a really a flawed component of this 35 calendar day thing is that we're expecting to wait the full 35 calendar days, which doesn't inherently make sense. So for example, if I know that I'm going to have to, you know, again, based on their theory cover part of my position, I'm not inherently going to wait until day 35. That doesn't really benefit me. What I'm going to try to do is find the best pricing over that month and a half for the month and a week to get where I'm trying to get best pricing for what I'm trying to cover.

I was wondering what the fuck is going on in the chat. You guys would know better than me, but I was expecting people to think that the short interest was even higher in this period leading into 2020. Is that about right? I think that the short interest was under reported, which I think is broadly supported by the way, but I don't know how high. Like we thought it was leading into 2020.

So one of the things that I would want to look at personally with this and this is one of the things that I think that the community unfortunately does too frequently in this kind of analysis is focusing too much. On the basket of interest and not including enough controls. So what makes this data more powerful is if for example we created a list of the most commonly of the top 10 desial for example of short interest names.

The correct way to frame this thought, which is the underlying concept that they came up with, is way more to the effect of what happened in the years that had a spike in short interest. Because we can absolutely see a spike in 15, but this is also like to me, what's even more important are the percent changes. If we take a look at oh nine to 10, that's a massive percent change. It's not necessarily the highest in terms of short interest, but that is of interest to me. Same thing from this period between 2010 and 2011. That's another massive spike that you see. So the way to think about these investigative questions is not to come up with your hypothesis of I think it was a law or Fed policy related. But do your best to approach it more open ended.

Especially things like Tesla which are higher volatility and Microsoft which we know is lower volatility really big company. So it is literally perfect that they included these names. But to make this plot more meaningful you have to include similar sized names. And it's because especially at this point where game stop is a much smaller company. They are always going to have more volatility. It's a nature of being a smaller company. So comparing the movement patterns of game stop against Tesla in this case again is perfect to painting the broader picture. But we needed we need to see more of these.

    "text": "Fed was trying to slow it down perfect storm for short friendly environment. I agree with that. One thing to note for the short friendly environment specifically is the rates aren't simply set by what the federal funds rate is. The other thing is there's premiums associated with the nature of the stock. So if things are hard to borrow, they're inherently more expensive to short, even if it's a low federal funds rate environment. Now if it's a higher rate environment that's just going to exacerbate it. So the one thing to note here is that this absolutely is completely cracked that it's a short friendly environment, but it is important to temper that with the fact that if if something is hard to borrow, it still is relatively expensive, even if it's a low fund rate environment. So when I think happened long as bull market high frequencies realize that this bull market was propped up on the F on the feds massive balance sheet. And or a hedge fund sorry, I assume that's what that means instead of high frequency firms. Would need to be economic tightening anticipating an end to the bull market initiated a giant short campaign in 19. And that's a fucking hell of that's a hell of a. My guess is the timing might be something like that, but I absolutely would not say that that's the reason the essentially building a giant short position just because of a long bull market. I",

I can't imagine that being the case now again the reason why they did it doesn't really matter I agree with the finding that it absolutely does look like that short interest blew up during then, which is a completely fair, fair observation. The reason why and the reason why I'm even mentioning that is because it's really important not to underestimate or misconstrued the motivations for quote unquote the enemy and that's part of what this is to essentially say it's just that is a little bit like.

Okay this hypothesis back by no data and is really just an experiment based on the fact that meme stocks correlate what if hedge funds are using some type of swap on them which absolutely I absolutely would expect that to be the case. It would make sense given extremely low interest rates not even from the interest rates by the way so again to understand the context behind this. One of the one of the really really useful thing about swaps is you can build it to be exactly what you want so I think that's agnostic to the low interest rate environment because depending on how they're built the rate environment could help her hurt but I think the product itself of a swap. Is so pertinent to this exact use case so again I wouldn't tie it to low interest rates but what a swap is and what it provides. It would make even more sense given the negative beta of game stop perhaps they use total return swaps or another instrument to cover to add more pressure ID cages the thought. It wouldn't necessarily be to add more pressure or to cover outright but it would be to make the bet is on exactly what they want which is underlying to go down in different conditions",

Could this be the work of an algo no more observing similarities well I think algorithms are highly trained on the retail trading behavior in game stop we literally saw this with. We absolutely saw this. When the cat tweeted about chewy. Chewies price movement was insane and we looked at that closely and it happened out of velocity that it literally we we can not definitively but near definitively assert that that was algorithms that we're moving off of that so completely think that algorithms are part of this. And I wouldn't even I wouldn't bother saying if it's all the work of an algo or partially the work of an algo though that element really we won't know but I absolutely think that it's very very easy to say like yeah a algorithm like algorithms in general are heavily involved in this broader process without a doubt completely completely believe that. um.

The way to think about I would build on to what Scott said I think the bespoke element is absolutely the most important part but to think about what bespoke means in this context and again Michael burry in the big short is such a great example of that it's essentially the ability to build something that directly exposes you to the specific thing you want exposure to a great example of this is variance swaps so if you're a retail trader and you're trying to. In the trade that the difference between implied and realize volatility you have to use options and when you're trading options to capture that ball variance you essentially have to continually delta hedge which has a cost associated with that there's a lot of things that make it a very impure way to express that idea.

So we're all bound on it and whatnot but definitely way more than when way more opportunities to specify your exposure way more than on the retails. All right. A lot of you probably extremely excited for earnings on the 9th not to get your hopes up okay. So I think this is like I really really like this piece a lot. The analysis that they did was relatively good I think it's missing some really important elements with respect to making like the outputs a little bit more robust with what you can take away and like the correlation analysis for example and then also the movement based analysis on a green day I was a little bummed on that because the like a green day is just so open ended markets exhibit positive drift you have to like break",
