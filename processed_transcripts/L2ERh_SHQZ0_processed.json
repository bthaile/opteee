He's the guy that actually built or led the development of this software that's in the background here that I still use now which is think or swim. So first off Tom thank you so much for taking some time to come hang out and talk trading with us. We really appreciate your time. Sure. Looking forward to it. Yeah so like I was telling you right before we started trading options really young I was super fortunate to come across it and it was really like 2008 not a lot of great resources out there and then I came across you guys when I was in college and I reached out to you a few times to chat with you and something that always stuck out to me about your approach to trading and investing is you made it feel possible you made it feel approachable to me you would talk about very advanced concepts but you made it so that it felt like somebody like me who didn't really know anything that I could potentially dip my toe in. How did you develop that ability to translate really complex topics but make it approachable to such a large number of people it's a personal question but I'm very curious the answer. Well it's funny you put it that way because a lot of times I like to describe my own journey",

Of course yeah so how for retail traders that are notoriously emotionally tied to their trades obviously you're wired differently they're also wired differently how do you think they could potentially think about those trades that are not going well to mentally keep them kind of regulated so that they're not going through this emotional roller coaster as a trades up they're elated as the trades down they're depressed.

Well one of the things that we do I think really well here at Tasty is we hammer home the concept of there is no real defense mechanism in trading other than keeping your size you know in check and so one of the things that I think we've done probably better than anybody in the world is can is really convinced people that if you trade small there's a lot less that you have to worry about like when things when things go bad so we are we're proactive in the sense of getting people to trade reasonable trade size which I think protects them against kind of that really ugly you know that ugly sound now that doesn't mean that there's not tons of ugly scenarios we get that that's traded but we also try to bring a very logical approach to you know the way we adjust positions the way we reduce size or roll out I mean like I feel like living in the option world it's much more strategic and there are it's got a lot more flexibility or optionality when things go wrong as opposed to a very black and white position like a stock position or a futures position you know I feel like option positions have a lot more choices when things go wrong so that's one of things we like about it's just more strategic got it I think",
