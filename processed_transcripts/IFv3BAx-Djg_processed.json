    "text": "One of the coolest things about trading options, or even if you don't trade them, but options in general, is that they provide you probabilities for things, because options are probabilistic tools that all of the market uses and it creates a consensus of where we think things might go. So you can literally open up options chain, and some people will use Delta as an approximation for an option being in the money at expiration, it kind of works. So you can do that for really short term stuff less than like 20 days. But as soon as you get outside of a 20 day window, if you take a look at the actual calculation of an options probability of being in the money, versus Delta's, it differs a lot, especially the further out you go, just keep that in mind. But you can use options to say, well, I think a stock might be going to 105, but what's the probability? You can answer that with options. They're really cool, lots of things you can use them for, be an online, see you later.",
