    "text": "What's up everybody Eric here welcome back to all the outliers and we are here with the outlier podcast and I have David Hunter back on I think this is probably like your seventh or eighth time with us. We kind of catch up every quarter which serves as a really interesting way to follow along your view of markets how things are playing out and then to receive new information as you're seeing it. So first off welcome back great to have you. Yeah thanks Eric. Good to see you. Merry Christmas for happy Hanukkah whatever. Yeah we're getting now. I was saying right before we started you already got the red sweater on so you're quite festive which I can appreciate like I was just telling you my wife she started decorating for Christmas two weeks ago. So it's all a blur to me at this point but yeah man what a year. So I have a lot of things that I want to talk to you about. The very first one is the last time we connected for everybody's context you and I spoke sometime like mid to late August it was like right around there and at that point you felt the market was at kind of a decision point. We started to pull back speaking of the SP 500 here. We started to pull back and you were saying that you felt we could either continue down towards you know like 4200 or that could",

We started to pull back and you were saying that you felt we could either continue down towards you know like 4200 or that could have been the low that we ran up and out. Since then we fell down a little bit further to 4100 but then from there we've essentially have been up and out. What are your thoughts on that move? Yeah that was what I call a perfect retrace. I actually was almost a very symmetrical inverted head and shoulder so 4100 actually made sense but I didn't think we'd get quite down there but we did and then came right out of that and I said the week we turned I said it looks to me after we had a couple very strong days out of that bottom. It looks to me based on the fact that everybody's so bearish and the fact that the markets had two or three big days I said it looks like we're starting to melt up right now. I have been saying we'd probably really have to wait until you know new highs, new all-time highs to really get the market going but those first few days there was just so much behind them that it felt like we were going to just come out of that last pullback and then just keep going",

You can see the move you know came right down to a turn line bounced off it and you know I have moved right back up to that almost to that 4600 area that we started the correction from so I don't believe we're going to see any more 8 to 10 percent corrections until we get to the top you know could have three to five percent corrections at any time so you know I'm not saying we can't you know there's going to go straight up but pretty close I mean I think we are looking at a steep rally what a meltup means is something that's parabolic ultimately parabolic and very steep and you cover an awful lot of ground in a matter of months so that's what I think we're into now you know could we go back to 434400 before we take off to new highs we could will we I have no idea you know I think a lot depend on what numbers come out that you know trigger something so let's say tomorrow I think you get the PCE tomorrow the you know the inflation number",

Yeah well one of the things I am hopeful for is that when we're going through this process of you know passing a lot of these different bills and whatnot to potentially try to keep the lights on maybe we could finally get the daylight savings bill through as",

Yeah well one of the things I am hopeful for is that when we're going through this process of you know passing a lot of these different bills and whatnot to potentially try to keep the lights on maybe we could finally get the daylight savings bill through as well so that it doesn't keep getting fucking 430 that would be okay that would ease the pain a little bit. Yeah I don't understand you know who gets her backup over something like that you'd think that that would be one thing that you could get both parties and all sides to agree on and you know even that they can't solve. That was the joke I ran for a while I said you know we're in trouble when like you can't even you can't even unify behind something that everybody universally hates. Yep. So before we wrap up you talked a little bit about some of the commodities right so we talked about some gold we didn't talk too much about metals so how do metals behave during this cycle? Yeah I'm glad you asked because I think I think metals are just coming alive. It's been a long wait they had a great run and you know from the March lows in 2020 to August highs particularly silver but silver and gold both they went sideways to down and probably more down than sideways from August 2020 to just a little while ago and we are coming",

Yeah so this is you know this is actually a year ago so let me zoom out a little bit more to get closer to thesis yeah so on this one 2021 is back here if you want 2020 we can go five years so here's 2020 back here yeah so you see you had that quick sell off in March 2020 then you had the big run-up and and then you can see it's been basically a sideways down",
