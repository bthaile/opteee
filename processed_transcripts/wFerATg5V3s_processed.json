    "text": "What's up everybody? Eric here with a video on how to use linear regression channels in your trading. We're going to cover two things. The first one is what are linear regression channels and really why I like them. And then the second thing is how can we use them to trade. Now a lot of people at different points will have heard of things like standard deviation channels. Linear regression channels are different from standard deviation channels and we will explain how. So let's start off with what linear regression channels are. They are a price analysis tool and we typically use it to identify prevailing trends as well as extremes. Now there's two main components when we're talking about linear regression channels. We're going to have the line of best fit and then we're going to have the channels themselves. So let's take a quick look at what this looks like. Don't mind the rest of the noise on the chart. I want you to focus on two things. The first one is this purple trend line and then these dashed yellow linear regression channels. Notice one's a little bolder than the other one. This is a 100 linear regression channel and then this is a 50. So what is a linear regression channel? What it's doing is it uses whatever aggregation period that you're looking at. So right now we're looking at a six month daily. If I change this to a one year day, notice how",

So right now we're looking at a six month daily. If I change this to a one year day, notice how the linear regression itself changes. What it's doing is it's creating a line of best fit, which is this purple line that you see kind of that goes straight through the most of the data points. It's exactly what it is. It's just a statistical measure of each data point in the aggregation period and it creates a line of best fit for that. Then these dash lines are built by using the price extremes within that aggregation period. So notice at the 100 we see a touch up here at that level and we also see price kind of touching below this level. What this is doing, it's taking instead of standard deviation channels, which also uses a line of best fit. But then it just plots standard deviations off of that line of best fit. The difference is linear regression channels uses the price extremes to create the bands. So a 100 linear regression channel is going to be out at the most extreme prices during that data set. Again, in this case now it's a one year daily. And then the 50 is going to be half of that move off of the line of best fit.",

And then the 50 is going to be half of that move off of the line of best fit. So the reason why I really like linear regression channels is it's using the current data from the chart as a measure of price and giving you both trend and identification of extremes during that point. Similar to standard deviation channels, we would expect to see in this case 100 of data between the 100 level right because it's saying that we're going to have the largest move is 100. That's the widest this band can go. So as we get moves bigger than that, this 100 band will move. So the real utility though is just like any other statistical measure, if you'll notice, once we start hitting up near, I always refer to it as a plus to standard deviation linear regression. It's technically incorrect. It's very close to that again, because right now 100 of data falls between this as compared to, you know, 95 which falls between plus one minus two standard deviations. So even the stats, you know, undergrad side of me gets a little piv that that, but it's just more efficient. So in this case, I'll refer to these as a plus to minus two linear regression channels or really call a plus",

So in this case, I'll refer to these as a plus to minus two linear regression channels or really call a plus three minus three, which is 99.7. But the main point really is when we're looking at price, the vast majority of price is going to fall within these two bands. You will see things poke through it. And again, that's because it's based off of the aggregation period. And that is why I don't say 100 falls within because even though you'll notice that there's nothing really closing below these bands, they can still exceed it during intraday. So again, that's due to the aggregation period. All right. So let's talk about how we can use them to trade. Well, I already told you, let's start with kind of broader picture and zoom our way in broader picture trend analysis. So this line of best fit is really useful because it's giving you the prevailing trend for the data set that you're looking at. So when we're looking at IWM on a one year daily, our trend line is decreasing. It means that overall average price as right now is declining. It's not growing. It's declining. So you can use this to get just general market sentiment that way. The other thing you can do is when we're looking at",

Again, this case, it's, you know, IWM. So we can see that back in March of 21 during the COVID drop, we were down at this minus two linear aggression channel. Again, we have holes poking below it, which would indicate intraday moves below those levels. But since then we've then rebounded to this 50 level and we're back down towards the minus 50 or again, I like to use minus one linear aggression channel. So in this case, we again expect to see 95 or 100 of data that closes within this, but 95 of data should fall within this. Again, that includes these tails. And then for the plus one minus one, we would expect to see 68 of data. So the majority, which is pretty much the case is what you're seeing here.

We see that we're actually flirting with this minus two linear aggression channel and bouncing up out of it. Typically, when I see things at plus two minus two linear aggression channels, that's an extreme. We can typically start to at least explore a contrarian trade idea in these instances, because it's a statistical measure. So we don't expect to see going into perpetuity data to bundle at these extremes. So when we see it, we can look to take a contrarian trade there, maybe when it hit this high of plus two linear aggression, we could have faded it.

Or if you see what you saw in IW here, where we blew through it, then maybe there's a continuation to the downside that you can trade. So when I'm using these longer term linear aggression channels, I'm really just gaining context of where price is in its history and then how it's kind of reacting to itself. Then as we zoom in closer to the windows that we're looking to trade is where it gets more interesting. So for example, we're now at a six month daily if I'm going to sell puts in IWM, I like the six month and the three month. So looking at the six month, we were in a pretty strong decline.

Again, just indicated by this purple trend line across the chart. The other thing that I see is notice how we started trying to move through this upper linear aggression channel over here, but down here, we're just kind of lightly flirting with it to me a lot of times. This could show that we really haven't bottomed out in terms of downside move. Again, this isn't my favorite for support resistance, but it gives me some ideas in terms of where price is moving around. So the thing that I like to watch here is various stereotypical higher highs higher lows and we can see that we kind of were struggling right here and this typically is not a great signal. So in conjunction with linear aggression channels, I can use small little trends like the price lines like this to get an idea of where prevailing trend is going, but overall six months prevailing trend is down easy to see clear as day. So in this case, if I was looking for a perspective trade, I might look to see how it reacts to this minus one. If I'm interested in trying to get long I WM if I see a blow through this minus one. There's a good chance that I could",

If I'm interested in trying to get long I WM if I see a blow through this minus one. There's a good chance that I could take a look at a short position in I WM. So I think the true power of linear aggression channels lies in the identification of price extremes, specifically if we're looking to trade shorter term time frames. If we're looking to trade longer term time frames, it's still really useful for overall trend analysis to get an idea of, OK, so for this is a two year daily chart and we can see that we are really at an extreme to the downside. So we over all long term price would not truly want to gravitate at least closer to this trend line. Now two things would happen as new data points are added. This trend line will start to assume the new average integrating those new data points. But again, this is using a lot of data. So we know that the line of best fit at least has a lot of volume and price traded there. That's where it's created from. So I think using linear aggression channels is a awesome tool. It can be very enlightening in terms of prevailing trends and then we can also use it for some shorter term identification of price extremes. So",
