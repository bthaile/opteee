    "text": "where it gets more interesting so for example we're now at a six month daily if i'm going to sell puts in iwm i like the six month and the three month so looking at the six month we're in a pretty strong decline again just indicated by this purple trend line across the chart the other thing that i see is notice how we started trying to move through this upper linear regression channel over here but down here we're just kind of lightly flirting with it to me a lot of times this could show that we really haven't bottomed out in terms of downside move again this isn't my favorite for support and resistance but it gives me some ideas in terms of where price is moving around so the thing that i like to watch here is very stereotypical higher highs higher lows and we can see that we kind of we're struggling right here and this typically is not a great signal so in conjunction with linear regression channels i can use small little trends like this price lines like this to get an idea of where prevailing trend is going but overall six months prevailing trend is down easy to see clear as day so in this case if i was looking for a prospective trade i might look to see how it reacts to this minus one if i'm interested in trying to get long iwm if i see it blow through this",
