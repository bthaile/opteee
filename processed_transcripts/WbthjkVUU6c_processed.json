    "text": "Options are really cool because they let you trade a lot of different things. And one of those things is volatility. You can trade the behavior and the movement of a stock versus the price direction itself. And it provides another source of returns. So that when the market's going down or when it's not doing what we want, there's other ways we can make money. Now, one of the cool things you can trade is earnings. And right now this is STNE. They have earnings coming up. And if I show you this chart here, it's pretty interesting. This actually plots the volatility for different timeframes. And this is something I've shared before. Those that are in the Patreon, you can download the thanks script here for free. It's super simple to make. You can make your own effectively. What this is is we can see that starting typically about two weeks out before earnings, volatility implied volatility will start to expand. Both short-term and long-term. And then after the earnings release, typically speaking, we will see the volatility absolutely catastrophically contract. So we can trade both the expansion of volatility into the earnings release and then the contraction, those release. Be an outlier. See you later.",
