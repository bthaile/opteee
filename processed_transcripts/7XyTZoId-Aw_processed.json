I think maybe the only green chicken that I'm aware of, but welcome back to the podcast. Great to have you. Eric, great to be back with you. So it's been about a quarter since we've spoken last and maybe like a lot has happened also not. I guess there's always a lot happening, but I thought it would be cool to start with looking back at 2023 and from your purview as a whole, two things. First, what stood out to you in two? How did things progress against expectations for you? Great questions. And first of all, great to be back with you. I always enjoy our conversations and it's going to be a fun one today. The thing that jumps out to us in 2023, first and foremost, is the lack of a recession in the US. I think the consensus view heading into the year was the Fed couldn't raise rates at the speed with which they were attending to without destroying the economy. They're going to raise until they break something was the common knowledge on Fin Twit and in much of the punitive class of which were a",

They're going to raise until they break something was the common knowledge on Fin Twit and in much of the punitive class of which were a charter member. So that's meant not as a derogatory term. And also I think there was consistent or sort of as an auxiliary observation to that, there was this view which we held up that the US was probably reaching its capacity to produce hydrocarbons and the shell patch would roll over. And the big aha for us here in the years is neither of those materialized. The US kept producing record-breaking month after record-breaking month of oil and NGLs and natural gas and even exported a record volume or value of coal. And also the US did not slip into a recession. And as an analyst, when you get something raw, what matters most is what you learn from it. And the difference between an analyst and an advocate is an analyst seeks to understand, as opposed to an advocate seeks to be proven right. And we pride ourselves on trying our best to be analyst. Look every time you make a call, you'd like to be right. But when you're not right, that's a really amazing opportunity to learn.

And one of the rare big sort of aha's in the second half of 2023 was connecting those two dots. The US did not go into recession precisely because it is a hydrocarbon-producing powerhouse. The shell revolution has added 2.5 Saudi Arabia's to the US energy mix. The vast majority of which is trapped and or used here, which feeds a pretty decent manufacturing sector unlike other petrol states who just have the commodities to rely on. The US has all manner of downstream manufacturing chemicals and other motives and fertilizers and you name it. And today at 1.65 from the UNB2 natural gas, natural gas is selling in the US for the energy equivalent price of 10 a barrel oil. And if you plug 2.5 Saudi Arabia's into a manufacturing sector, it's unlikely even at 5 interest rates that that economy is going to suddenly go into a recession. And I think that was a big aha for us. I still think the vast majority of analysts don't really understand the critical role that energy plays in the economy. The view energy is just another input into the economy. We have a different view. And that was the big story of 2023. The US kept smashing.

You mix all those things in with elite universities, all of the deep water ports and river systems and fertile farmland and all of the other inherited damages that Peter Zahane will tell you makes America great. That's pretty tough, pretty tough to overcome if you're in the recession camp, which we were in. And so having gotten both calls wrong, we decided to try to understand why. And so that was the big sort of second half saga for us. Yeah, I have one of your posts pulled up over here. It's called Atlas Won't Shrug. And there's a section here that follows the thread that you're literally just talking about. And it says, quote, energy is not an input into the economy. It is the economy. Can you expand on that? Yeah, if you go on to read the rest of that post, it says humanity organizes its economic activities to ensure a steady growth in the extraction and exploitation of primary energy.

We had the young people war in between. And the embargo against the West Biopakken. The 1980s brought the war between Iran and Iraq. And then of course, Saddam Hussein evaded Kuwait. And we had a million troops in the Middle East in short order. We had the Asian financial crisis. We had the rubble default in the late 90s. We had the connected long-term capital management collapse as a consequence of the rubble default. Not 11 happened. The war on terrorism. We destabilized Syria. We destabilized Libya. All manner of negative consequences. Afghanistan collapsed. We had COVID. All of these things happened in the last 50 years since Nixon took the US off the gold standard.

Have you analyzed or thought about the tie to an expanding population versus standard of living or vice versa? Oh, sure. So you could do these very famous charts and we've done them where you plot energy use per capita versus GDP per capita. There are no rich countries that are energy poor. And in fact, ultimately energy is the economy as we say in the piece. And look, the human endeavor is a constant, unrelenting struggle against the forces of entropy disorder is spontaneous. Right angles do not appear naturally in the environment. In order to have a high standard of living, you need to impose order on your local environment and it by the law of thermodynamics necessitates that you must harness primary energy and ultimately waste heat. You can't like to balance the energy equations in order to have order, you need to waste heat. And the economy is basically one giant heat wasting machine.

Check the roofs, make sure like no animals are getting into it and cut back the shrubbery and all of the things that go into running your home. Painting the exterior, all of this stuff. You do these things because left on its own your house would eventually devolve into a chaotic mass. Whereas order is the opposite of chaos and to create and maintain order requires a constant stream of primary energy. And if you look at the global south and you ponder the fortified billion people currently living at seventh, sixth or fifth of the energy that we use here in the west, all of those people would love nothing more than to be able to waste as much energy as we do. And I mean waste in the most neutral sense. You can't have order without wasting heat. And who are we to deny them? This prospect that the world is just going to do without, I think, is fundamentally anti-human. How do you decipher the relationship between energy as a contributor to standard of living versus something like technology or is energy a feat to technology in your perspective here?

Energy is different than labor because you can't have labor without energy. The people working need to eat food is the derivative of energy. Clean water is a derivative of energy. And so during times of energy abundance, we have excess energy. Energy can be reasonably well modeled as an input into the economy like all the others, but during times of energy crises is where there's a shortage of energy. And look, if you just take a step back, we know that if all goes to 200 a barrel, what happens? We trigger recession. We know that Germany screwed up its energy policy. It's de-industrializing. It's in the middle of a recession. The UK doesn't produce hardly any of its own energy. It's a victim of the energy crisis. It's in a recession. If the lack of energy is a catalyst for economic malaise, what does it mean in the US to have added to a half Saudi Arabia since 2010 to, it's mostly domestic energy mix?

I mean, at some point you have to trust some data, does the government massage the data for political reasons sure? But there is a manufacturing construction boom going on in the US. And in the next two job prints, we're going to see ever increasing manufacturing jobs as those construction projects wrap up. And the people who are going to work in those factories start checking in. If you get something wrong, you have to try to understand why. And that's how you get better.

It's less interesting to me the part that I was really honing in on there was what do you think led to you guys coming across this change last year compared to another point in time and it sounds like the summary of that was the rate change environment was very unique and that's that was the catalyst for the assessment there. But the lack of a follow through of a recession once the rates were hiked so violently right. So you see you know Powell takes it from zero to five and if you look at the GDP prints like show me on the chart where Powell you know raised the rates you can't find it.

You can't on the one hand understand why it is that Germany is de-industrializing because they have totally screwed the pooch on their energy policy and then look at the US producing 20 million barrels of oil in petroleum products a day 105 BCF of natural gas a day more cold than it burns all the nuclear fleet hominal log at 9 capacity factors and say to yourself this is an environment that is conducive to a recession just isn't so it isn't like that there was staring at a face and look we were we got it wrong and when we told our subscribers when we came and the big realization for us came in November to give you a bit more detail.

Talk to me about the world war three comment.
