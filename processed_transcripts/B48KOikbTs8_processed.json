    "text": "you you you you you you you you that you you What's up, outliers, happy Friday. Welcome back to another episode of Outlier Options Trading Basics. Today, we are going to take a closer look at a really overlooked portion. I would argue of developing a trading strategy, but actually understanding what we're looking at and whether or not what we're actually looking at makes sense, doesn't make sense. And this actually follows a recent series for the Outlier Pro members last week, a couple days ago where what we are doing is looking at pattern recognition. So this realistically is just following off of that idea of pattern recognition. What that looks like, how to interpret it, those kinds of things. So let's start with a super quick overview and then we will get into detail. I'm going to move us over to the main screen so that I can look right ahead instead of at an angle. And I'm going to refresh us off of this. And then I'm going to walk you through just another slide with some key concepts. The way that I envision this going is I want to talk about the process broadly. And then I want to talk about some of the more common mistakes that I see. And then I want to talk about some of the metrics that might make sense to take a look at. So there's a few things that we have slated for the agenda is always it",

I'm actually going to use the material that we're talking about today for a standalone video at some point. So feel free to interrupt as much as you can. Anything that doesn't make sense or you want to double click into, please tell me because it's literally the point of doing these on a stream. You are not bothering me. You're not interrupting me. It's nothing like that. It's literally what we're here to do, which is to have a interactive process as we're looking at this because this stuff can be a little bit challenging up front. The cool part is as with most things in trading. Once you have a sense of like what it is, it really is nothing that crazy. You'll see that it makes a ton of sense inherent to itself. So it looks like we got why not Lauren E. Hodge, Wheel Strat Joe, a bunch of familiar names. As always, that's my favorite because it tells me we have people that are growing over time, which is perfect. So first things first, let's just understand what people tend",

As always, that's my favorite because it tells me we have people that are growing over time, which is perfect. So first things first, let's just understand what people tend to do when it comes to a strategy. And in general, I think we all tend to know, but people tend to just kind of just shoot from the hip, right? They just completely go off the cuff. And there's not really any sort of defined process around the way that they're thinking about creating a strategy, managing a strategy, evaluating a strategy. And therefore, there's really nothing that we would expect to see long-term that would be positively expected. And I'll explain a few reasons as to why that's the case. So first, let's just take a look at a couple, as always, Reddit posts. These are like some of the best possible places to see what normal people do in how normal people think. And this is not a drag on any of these people. It's just a great representation of how it is so easy to be misled in this business. And it's not misled in terms of like somebody tricking you. It's just literally based on your own eyes. So this post talks about green 16 slash 17 so 16 out of 17 months in a row, selling options. And then they give you some context",

This one says, did I find the safest trading strategy or am I just dumb? This one says, I've recently discovered to me what seems like a perfect trading strategy. It consists of buying a call debit spread on spy with a strike price about 5 under current trading value 1 wide zero to two days to expiration. Contracts cost about 80 cents due to the fact that spy doesn't usually drop more than a percentage in one day. You'll always reach your max profit. But doing this for the past two weeks made about 6 gain on my overall account granted that I do have a small account, which we can obviously assume based on the fact that a 80 trade led to a 60 gain on the account. My question, are is this really profitable in the long term? In my risking too much for the amount back, what are your overall thoughts on the strategy? So this is how normal people evaluate a strategy. This is somebody that says, I think I found something that makes sense and good for them for going to even a community like Reddit and saying like, yo, fact check",

Unfortunately, as most of us know that have been in the business for a while, this you're going to see this kind of result here. And after this video, you'll know how to actually analyze this more in detail to get a usable output. And then we have one more. This person says, it's been about 18 months. And by the way, the way that I found these is I literally just went into options and just typed in the word strategy. So these are just posts from there. These aren't like cherry picked. I just picked the top couple. And this says, the whole description is in the comments. Basically, spring of 22 almost done. Big issue, not taking gains, not knowing when to cut losses. Okay, never mind. What the fuck am I reading right now? I thought that there's going to give me a strategy. Keep it simple statistically. The vast majority of traders don't make money.

What made me click of this, to be honest, is the fact this, it's been about 18 months in my strategy has been consistently winning with a high success rate. This was the issue that I had with this one. That's why I wanted to look at it. So I don't actually even see, it says the whole description is in the comments. So maybe there's actually a strategy in there or something. But anyways, this is wrong. Like, this is the wrong way to look at it. It's the same reason why this is wrong. And we'll understand why.

Once you have that for a couple moments, I'm going to start walking you through what I would do. And I want you to compare what you came up with on your own against what we're about to go through together. I want you to see what's the same because there will be things that are the same. I'm pretty sure. And what's different. And I guarantee you there will be things that are different. So off we go. Now for those unfamiliar with the outlier strategy process, like I said, in the beginning, we're going to start here. This is just a framework for building a strategy. The reason why this matters is because when we get into the concept of reviewing a strategy, you'll see that there's actually a very important first step when we're trying to review a strategy, which we're going to talk about in a second.

And I think this will make it a better, a better experience, which is what we're going for. Oh, bad. Joe says, buy and hold diversified funds has been my best strategy. Yeah. Well, especially somebody like you, Joe, to be honest, it makes a lot of sense. And it's because you have funny enough. I actually realized I need you just jog my mind for something.

And then bouncing out when it's not working, we refer to that as strategy hopping. And it's really nefarious. And you'll actually see there's something in here that talks directly about that. So yeah, buy and hold for most people realistically will work best. Now, if we take a look at the ally of strategy process, you'll notice that there's four steps. And these first two steps as always are all about the profit mechanism. They're not about a strategy at all. And then we get into creating strategies between these two steps. Okay. So if we now move on to the concept of evaluating a trading strategy, you'll notice that the first thing, the very first thing that's here is idea. You can't evaluate a trading strategy unless you have some sort of idea on what it is you're trying to monetize the profit mechanism. And some idea on what it should look like.

So that's the case where somebody puts on a trade, they make money, they made money on a trade, but they didn't make money for the right reason. Just happen to make money because of path. The danger here is that if I were to try and become a professional pool player, and the premise of my skill set is sometimes when I shoot the ball, some shit goes in, but it's not really what I'm trying to do, I'm probably not going to go that far. It's the same thing in trading, but the differences is in trading, everybody is just equally happy when they make money, and this goes back to a broader concept about a lack of attention to the process, and everybody's focused on the outcome, which is a whole other conversation. So you have to start with a defined idea. We take the idea, we analyze it. So the idea in this context is a profit mechanism.

So now is where we get to the point of evaluation. We have a profit mechanism, we analyze it, we build a strategy around that, and now we're testing the strategy. Now is when we get to analyze. The process of analysis is actually really, really simple. We're going to observe what happens with our strategy. Then we're going to iterate on the strategy. This is when we're bringing other elements back in, applying new filters, maybe testing different deltas, all that kind of stuff. We're iterating. We're trying to see what fits optimally. And then once you finish this process in a paper trading sense, then we can move to a live variation of this, and then an actual full-scale trading, like utilization of this.

So if we go through these and think about them, I want you to go back to that exercise I gave you at the very beginning of this where I asked you to think about one of your strategies and just kind of loosely evaluate it in your head in terms of like, what are the things that you would be looking at and evaluating with your strategy. Then I want to run through this together now. And you'll see some things. First, regime impact. You tell me, is there a difference between 2020 and 2025? Year to date. Obviously, there's differences. It's not going to be the exact same. But broadly, if you think about the broad market conditions, are there differences? Lauren says yes, Joseph says yes. So name one of the differences.

Ricky says was that COVID? It was COVID. Reese says interest rates. Here we go. Now we're getting it. So rate environment. We had things like stimulation from the Fed. Everybody relax. Everybody relax. I know I said the word stimulation. Everybody got a little perked up there. But I meant from the Fed. If Big Daddy Jay Powell stimulates you, we have a problem. 2025. What do we have? We have Trump as press. And again, politics aside, your political leanings, being whatever they are, doesn't matter. There are implications with Trump as president. It is a fact. Age says higher rates, Bingo. Much higher rates. Age says more uncertainty around how Trump will act, Bingo. So now we have things like tariffs. We have a new conflict. And so on and so forth. So the regime matters so much. What you see and what performs well in this will differ than this. This is using two years at an annual view. This concept of regime, we talked about this in the procession when we were talking about pattern recognition. One of the key things to take away from that session is a reminder and then also to introduce it for those that weren't in there is that when we're analyzing regimes, we can analyze regimes",

One of the key things to take away from that session is a reminder and then also to introduce it for those that weren't in there is that when we're analyzing regimes, we can analyze regimes across a broad spectrum of levels. So we have things like an economic. We have things like the geopolitical. We have things like the stock market. And again, when I've refer to the stock market in this context, I'm talking about indices, behavior, commodities, vol, all that stuff. Then you click in another level. We have the individual stocks, sectors, so on. And then we finally start getting down to the portfolio level. All of these things have regimes. And the regimes aren't on an annual basis. When we think about regimes, you can have micro macro. There's regimes that come and go, that become relevant to very small points in time or very large points in time. So taking this all the way back to when we're evaluating a strategy, you have to be cognizant. Of what the regimes were in the thing that you're looking at. That's the backdrop. So to give you like an actual example of this, a practical example. Let me hide all that stuff. If I take a look at the last 10 years in SPX, and again, we know that 22 was a bear market.

If I take a look at the last 10 years in SPX, and again, we know that 22 was a bear market. That was a down year. So if I'm evaluating a long call strategy in 22, what do I think I'll see? Long call in equity index, probably lose money. If we're just doing what I've referred to as a dumb strategy, just a road strategy where we're just mechanical. Then if I were to buy a 30 day call and then roll it out in time every two weeks, probably not going to do great, probably not. Yet if I did that in 2020, I probably would have smashed it. It probably would have gone super well because on the downside, you have limited loss. You're not getting killed like all the long stock people are. And then you have unlimited upside potential. So the point here is if you don't pay attention to the regime when you're analyzing your strategy, you're making a massive mistake. Because a lot of us, we tend to oversimplify it in our brains. And then we miss a lot of important nuance. So if you did consider regime when I asked you in the exercise earlier to evaluate a strategy, just drop a Y in the chat. I'm curious how many people.

And I should put all of my money into this strategy. I started the strategy by risking, let's say, one percent of the account. But over this time frame risking just one percent of the account.

The overwhelming majority of instances, this thing is working beautifully. Yet they fall prey to path. So this is path.

Absolutely not. So this leads to one of the very many cognitive biases where people will, again, not understanding the context of what they're looking at, they'll throw something out. That might otherwise be pretty decent. Path confuses and loses most people, I think. And it's because path will always catch you. If you stay in the markets long enough, you are going to see what your actual skill is. The issue with path is that if I plot a time series again, path can carry your returns for a while. So this can be six years where the path of what you were doing happened to work. And then all of a sudden, what you're doing no longer works on year seven and you lose everything. This is why people that have really consistent returns in markets over long durations are super fucking rare. It's because of path. Okay. Next, small sample. I think everybody knows what this one is.

It's really not that difficult. We're literally going to calculate so that I know well, how many trades do I need to have before this thing actually starts to represent what the performance is. We can calculate it. So the idea of small sample is most people will say based on this grouping here, oh, shit, this thing is good. This is great. The problem is it's probably not. And if you continue doing it long term, you're going to see what it really is. And you're probably not going to like it. That's just the reality. Next, Goldilocks analysis. Goldilocks analysis applies to all of these. I was working with somebody on a coaching call this week. And we were looking at a zero DTE strategy. And in the zero DTE strategy, they were using a back testing tool. And in that back testing tool, there was a couple toggles, conditional toggles. I don't even remember what they were. There were two conditional toggles, though. And the performance before those conditional toggles, when they're on, the performance was, I don't remember, but let's call it like 15 return. Something like that. Or maybe 11. And then once we turned these conditional toggles off, the performance dropped to like 4. This is Goldilocks analysis. This shows me something that literally",

And then once we turned these conditional toggles off, the performance dropped to like 4. This is Goldilocks analysis. This shows me something that literally lacks all robustness. What this tells me is that the entire edge of the strategy was based on these conditional toggles, which were based on the back testing logic. That's a fucking problem. But when you want to see something so bad, your brain will make it so your brain will skip over these red flags. And be like, no, this is probably, this is probably pretty representative. I did it over a long term timeframe. It looks good over the long run. Your brain will make that leap for you. I know this all too well, because I've spent, I cannot tell you how many hundreds of hours testing strategies. And it's like the same thing when you're hunting for those that have been hunting before. I cannot tell you how many times I've seen a deer. Beautiful deer. Moving around pretty far just, you know, at the end of visual pretty far, I could swear it's moving. And then I look at it long enough, get a little closer and it's a fucking stump.

The way to overcome Goldilocks analysis is actually really, really simple. You should look at things the objective as objectively as you possibly can and you have to make it a habit. That's why you guys hear me talk about that so much and why I try to apply that lens so frequently because if you make it a habit, if you wire it as a part of the way you think, it becomes easier. The other thing is you have to be ready to do the hard things like turn off these toggles and see what the performance is and then see this drop. Why wouldn't that person have turned off these toggles just to see because they don't want to see. They want to see this so then",

All of these are basic statistical paths. It goes super deep. One of the absolute most common statistical traps that I can see with option traders bar none. Anybody guess what it is? I'm going to open the door for a tour but take a guess because I'm thinking you probably know. Bingo. Joe's on it. That's exactly right. The overwhelming majority of option traders they disgustingly, disgustingly exhibit a gross over emphasis on high win rate. Again, what are we what are we showing here? 16 at a 17 months. I have a video coming out on this post. I think the video will come out next Wednesday but to give you a pre read since 2024 8.32 percent. Yeah, this one 18 months high success rate.

It's so common and it's because you're taught to want to win in trading you have to completely reconfigure that. Winning is still part of it but the way that winning looks can look very different than what most people falsely bubble it up to being just a high win rate. For example, I'm looking at one of my strategies now. So I have a long call option strategy. My loss rate is 53 percent. The current win rate for the strategy is 47 percent. So it means that I'm losing more than 50 percent of the time with that strategy. Arguably not a high win rate yet. I'm trading the strategy. Why would I do that? I'm not going to do that. Reese has it. Reese has exactly what it is. It's a timing based strategy. The way that it makes sense is that I take small losses frequently. But then when it makes money, it makes a lot of money. So even though the win rate is only 47 percent, it's severely profitable. This is one of the issues with overemphasis on high win rates. All right, let's talk about some of these metrics. Howie? Not exhaustive by any stretch. This is actually what I would consider to be an MVP minimal viable product. So what we need to track and break down. And again, this occurs here.",

Every single trade will have at least some sort of positive or negative PL. Now there is the unicorn scenario where maybe your win is the exact size of your commissions and slippage included. I feel pretty confident saying the overwhelming majority of people won't find that circumstance. So what that means is you just need these two buckets. So let's talk about this.

I like to argue in the pursuit of information. But one of the downfalls of people that like to argue, but they're not thoughtful about it is they'll just take the other side. And if you just default to the other side, you're actually going to miss really important information. So when we look through this, you'll see that this by itself doesn't really show us that much. But if you just default to the other side of that, meaning you then say, well, then it's not useful data. It's a massive mistake. It's not true. There's nuance in this shit. It's super important.

So notice how we have number of trades open closed total right out of the gate. And then what I do is I break them out. I start with the overalls. So this is the average total average, meaning for the entire grouping. Then I segment the wins here. I segment the losses here. I look at the extremes, the tails, max and min. And then I also calculate the expected return. You can do different permutations for average PNL from expected return. But in this case, I calculate this separately. So that's essentially how I'm breaking out the trade count, the PNL and the expectancy. And for those that need a refresh on why you care about expected return, here's a video for you on this metric. Okay. So now we get into this to the more nuanced stuff that a lot of people probably don't look at. So first thing I like to plot is total standard deviation and then downside deviation. So what this does is if I'm plotting standard deviation, standard deviation just tells me how a data set the overall severity about a mean. So I was just looking at variance. So it's not downside meaning when the stock goes down. It's downside meaning, are my losing positions? What's the deviation? And this gives me",

So it's not downside meaning when the stock goes down. It's downside meaning, are my losing positions? What's the deviation? And this gives me a sense of how consistent is this thing. Then you can calculate things like max drawdown. So that would just be the sequence of your returns that yielded the largest or the smallest. But the worst PNL. So you can write a formula that does that. I want to look through all of my PNL and I want to find the sequence of returns where the consecutive losing trades led to the largest total amount of losses. That would show you your max drawdown. Then we can calculate sharp and sortino. I prefer sortino because like standard deviation and downsides, downsides standard deviation. Sharp is similar to standard deviation. It's looking at measuring risk adjusted returns of overall deviation. Sortino gives us that same thing. But again, for downside standard deviation. Then we can calculate something that I imagine most people don't calculate, which is coefficient variance.

So if we wanted to be within 15, standard margin of error, whatever it is, that we're calculating. You could throw that there, whatever. So the first metric you see here is 1.635. That represents a specific confidence interval. It's another statistical term. We have certain numbers that represent specific confidence intervals for the various formulas that we might use. Then we take AZ. Is it AZ? Oh, yeah, AZ here. Standard deviation. I was wondering when I made this, I made it backwards. Normally, I would start from here and then go here. Standard deviation. Now the way that I would also run this is first use the total standard deviation, but then use the downside standard deviation. Now, one of the things you're going to notice with your returns as a trader is that you are going to get huge coefficient variance, typically expressed as a percentage.

So the issue here is that when we get our final result of required number of trades, often it will be a huge number. That does not mean that the metric itself is useless. It means as always, you need to apply some context to the metric. One of them is I actually use a moving average for mine. So I can see is my performance tightening the range or is my performance expanding the range of required trades. If it's tightening the range, I can become more and more confident that what I'm seeing is likely a closer representation of the performance of the strategy. If I see it expanding the range, then I know that's not the case. So something like you might get 80,000 something like that. That absolutely can be the case. So that doesn't mean that if you get that you essentially say I can't use the strategy because I would need 80,000 instances to see if it works.

Age says thanks for the template. Yeah, perfect. That's exactly what you should do. You should use this as a starting point. Now there's a couple of ways that I would make this a little bit better by including things like not just the largest, not just the tails, but things like the median, the median matters a lot. What things end up about the middle. The other thing that I do is I calculate the returns, exonerating both tails, one tail, so that I can see how do things work? How does the average PL work if I get rid of the extremes? If I see the average PL move a lot, that tells me I have a strategy that's highly, highly dependent on whatever those extremes are. So if I can explain in an upside extreme, if that came from pure luck, then I would generally analyze the strategy without that data point included so that I can see what the true performance is. And then to the downside, if it's something where I fat fingered something and I just made a giant mistake, and that's what led me to lose a bunch of money that otherwise structurally wouldn't be part of the strategy, then I would exonerate that. I would still track it as my PL. It's my",

Now if you just have a strategy where if you take the tails off, the extremes, like the most extreme one or two trades, and it doesn't change that much, well then that tells you quite a lot. It tells you that your strategy is pretty widespread by itself. So there's a lot of small inferences like that that we can make.

You can either simply track these numbers and you can see how they're changing day over day. So you can take screenshots of your metrics. Any time you make an update. So if I'm down here updating a trade and then normally what I do is I have another section down here. So this would be like the live trade section. And then this would be the closed trade section. So if I copy this out and I actually just use a macro, there's a button I click. And when I click the button, it automatically inserts a cell down here. It copies this entire range as values down here. And then it deletes the input ranges from in this context AF to AX. So you can build a button that does it. That's easy or you can just copy and paste it and then come up here and manually delete. But what you can do is as you're updating your live trades.

The reason why it's so simple is you have to think of it this way. Once you build this, you build it once. So once you struggle through learning the difference between standard deviation, downside deviation between sharp and sortino between different margin of error inputs into your coefficient variance calculator. Right. Like once you tinker with all that stuff, once it's built, it's built. So you have to think, like I've been building my log literally for almost 20 years.

But in reality, it's really not. If you think about a professional sport, how many stats they give a professional athletes, they have everything from their average scoring by distance, by defender, by side of the court, like all of these stats. That's for basketball. And it's just because once you observe stuff long enough, you can come up with different data points that become relevant. So I view this as like a solid minimum starting point. This gives you at least enough stuff to take a look at to have some ideas on where to go. So now we'll just take a quick look at these. We already talked about a bunch of them. So you already know how to use literally all of these total PL. Obviously, you need to know how your thing is doing in total averages. So it breaks that down over different individual trade lens so that you know what each individual exposure typically looks like. We break down between wins and losses. So like everything in here is designed to make it simple to come up with at least broad ideas on what you might take a look at.

So for example, if I'm trading a long strangle or straddle strategy either or and I notice that my win rate as a percentage is going down, but my average PL is going up. That'll spark some questions. And as you're doing this, it'll be really simple. You'll immediately know that you're losing more frequently, but less. And when you're winning, you're winning more, but less often. But then you can actually measure the relationship between those. So if I see the average PL going up, is it because my wins are that much larger or is it because my losses have become much smaller? And this ties back into the trade plan and the trade plan change template that we talk about. Because when I think about my trade plan, let's say my trade plan says, I'm going to exit my, what is this long strangle? So I'm going to exit this long strangle talking on the losing side.

Now, it depends on what the strategy is and what the tails look like. Because taking it down at a 50 loss could improve my average PL or it can hurt my average PL. If it hurts my average PL, it tells me that I'm now knocking off too many wins. So I would then expect to see a change in my win rate and my average wins. So this is the iterative process.

What questions do you have anything else that you want to hit before we wrap up? Reese says, are they correlated? Yeah, you could argue that they're correlated. Just look at different things.

And then coefficient variance is showing you relative. So let's use Gemini. And let's say I'm learning about standard deviation and coefficient variance.

You're interested in how consistently they deliver your lattes, specifically how much milk they add in millimeters is a very specific person. You visit each cafe five times and measure the milk and your latte. So daily grind gives you these numbers, bean dream gives you these numbers. So you can calculate first the standard deviation for both of these, which essentially is you can see for each data point, you just need to find how far they are off a mean, you square them because it makes them all the same type of number positive integer. Then you sum them, and then you divide by the total data points, you square root, the reason why you take the square root is you squared them. So everything becomes magnified. So you take it back down to whatever the original magnitude was. And then you get your metric. So between these, we have seven mill and 14 mill.

And a lot of times like more often than not, we are going to express it as a percentage. So you take the standard deviation over the average and then turn it into a percentage.
