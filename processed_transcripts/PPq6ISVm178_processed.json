    "text": "What's up, outliers? Last week we did an update on the T-Trip Accus and SSO coverage strangle. This week I want to do an update on the game stop coverage strangle. It's actually for a pretty funny reason. What I do is track my total performance with the strategy across individual allocations. And you can see what my year-to-date performance was. This is at the end of April. I do a year-to-date performance after action review at the end of each month. Then you'll notice that the core allocation, which is the covered strangle, is contributing a little tiny baby 1 of total portfolio return. Now the portfolio that I share with you all is a subset of my broader portfolio. And this is my actual total portfolio return. Now the interesting thing here is for the core allocation, my position in SSO is currently negative slightly. It's like 0.8 something like that. Return on a vested capital for the allocation itself. And game stop is positive. And not only is it positive, but it's the second largest contributor to the core allocation coverage strangle performance. Yet it is by far the smallest allocation. So what I mean by that is if we take a look at the top here and we break out the specific allocations. Again, this is the subset portfolio. I'm using 600,000 and it's in TQs SSO, Ibit and GME, but take a look. Game stop represents a 4 total allocation, which is really, really funny",

Game stop represents a 4 total allocation, which is really, really funny if you think about it. So looking at Game Stop and the performance of the strategy so far down here, you'll see a few things. So from when we started this exercise, Game Stop was trading at 2431 and right now it's trading at 2748. That represents a 13 return, which is solid. However, if you take a look at the return as I'm trading at so far, it's at 22. That's including realized and unrealized PNL. And it's been really, really interesting trading Game Stop because if you take a look at when we originally started this exercise, it's been behaving really, really sideways. Right? So it's kind of from I forgot exactly when we started it was like end of December, maybe somewhere in here. And it's just been very, very sideways. So this happens to be an absolutely ideal condition for the coverage triangle. And it's because I rotate into different assets and different legs of the strategy based on how the underlying is behaving. And here's what that means. When we look at the coverage triangle, I can actually draw it for you so that it's a little more clear. There are effectively three legs. Leg",

When we look at the coverage triangle, I can actually draw it for you so that it's a little more clear. There are effectively three legs. Leg one is equity. Leg two is cash secured puts leg three is ratio short calls. So what that means is I'm getting my long delta's from these two. And then this is just kind of an ancillary position. This is secondary. It's really to take advantage of environments like this where things are kind of turning sideways or when things are going down to offset a little bit. The ratio short calls are not on unless equity is on or unless there is a large enough cash secured put position that it gives me time to react if things start going up to either by shares or so on and so forth. So what's happened in GameStop is we started with cash secured puts. Then we started layering into equity positions. Then we came out of the equity position and now we're specifically in cash secured puts. And so far, they're performing really, really well. And I just want to talk about the broader landscape for GameStop, the position, how it's evolved. And again, this overall strategy, the entire goal for this as always is to simply try and give more resources, more tools, more ideas on how to do",

And again, this overall strategy, the entire goal for this as always is to simply try and give more resources, more tools, more ideas on how to do things. So right now, I am 61 utilized in GameStop relative to its 25,000 total allocation, which fun fact, the allocation is actually going up. So I could increase the allocation now to 29,000 because we have a realized PNL of 2500. In fact, really, that can get reinvested into this. And then once these come off, that gives me an extra 33, 84 that I could definitely include into this if I wanted. Now, I realized that this was slightly off it needed to be using this cell. So this is the current value, essentially, the total of everything put together, the original position plus what the total PNL represents. So when we look at what's been performing well for the trade, it's absolutely been honestly trading options on it. And a big part of that has to do with how volatile GameStop is. If we take a look inside GameStop, we can see the implied volatility right now is 84.5, which on a relative scale for GameStop is actually super, super light. You can see that with an implied volatility percentile of 19, which is very low. Now, the reason why this is the case is because it",

Now, looking inside the options chain, I was just kind of poking through to see if anything stuck out to me. And nothing really has. It's been overall quiet in terms of total net premiums. So I looked through then the flow feed to see if there's any like big trades that were eyeing out at me. This is looking over the last week. And this is the biggest trade that we've seen in a while. But again, it's so far out in time that it kind of is inconsequential. And it's the same thing with these sold positions here. Really is just those are positions doing a lot of different things.

This is volume over open interest, not volatility. And slightly near term in nature, but those kinds of trades have been quite small. Overall, when I look inside of GameStop. So then when I was going through just trying to get a general understanding of what's been happening, anything jumping out, I did see some really high open interest contracts. But if you take a look, look how far out in time these are. This is actually very different because most of the time really high eye contracts in GameStop tend to be pretty close in time. So the fact that so many of these are 258 days, 958 days, 622 days, those are like pretty long term trades. This isn't just trading some sort of really near term price expectation.

And I'm also happy to see that it's not like this massive amount. It's a modest amount and they're raising it in a smart way, which we reviewed in a video a little while ago. So now let's take a look at one other thing. And I want to show you the term structure as things sit in GameStop. So when I take a look at the out of the money options and we got to get rid of this front expiration, let's just do like the main expiration so that it's a little less noisy. You'll see that the call side has come down huge on GameStop. This used to have really heavy callsque in terms of where most of the vol was priced in. So the fact that this is now assuming a more standard relationship where the put side is heavy compared to the call side, that's standard business as usual kind of stuff. So because that's the case, the market right now is in showing its hand in terms of expecting any sort of like massive near term moves. Now one thing that's worth noting is the call oh, I skew is the biggest we've seen in a long time with 913,000 calls against 2,000, 2,000 puts. That's massive. It's 3 times plus.

    "text": "of expecting any sort of like massive near term moves. Now one thing that's worth noting is the call oh, I skew is the biggest we've seen in a long time with 913,000 calls against 2,000, 2,000 puts. That's massive. It's 3 times plus. So really, really big call skew, but it's all over the place, which is slightly different. Most of the time we've seen this big call skew a lot of it has been in the front expirations, which just isn't the case right now. You can see for the volume today, 192,000 calls traded against 54,000 puts, but a lot of the calls were being at the bid. So that's typically calls that are being sold. And that's not necessarily a bearish concept. It's probably a lot of people that might have hold hold shares like an institutional level that are just selling calls against it because it's essentially rotating sideways and based on the term structure. The market isn't showing that it's expecting some sort of massive move pending. So it's just a way to continue to harvest volatility from this. So overall, GameStop continues to be a really solid performer. Again, in my portfolio, the return on a vested capital is over 20 from where we started this a few months ago. It's again, not insane amounts of money is a percent return, but it's something that's been actually really consistent and compliments the broader portfolio really well. So as always, if you have any",
