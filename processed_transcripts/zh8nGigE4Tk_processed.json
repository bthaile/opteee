    "text": "What's up outliers? Quick market update specifically on GameStop. Actually, I'm going to start doing a few videos per week covering a couple different covered strangles that I trade. And as we discussed in the introduction videos specifically for GameStop, I have an allocation of the portfolio that I'm using to trade a covered strangle in GameStop. And then I also have other ones in some leverage DTFs. I bit for Bitcoin and those will be separate videos. So the goal for today is to walk you through some updates on the position as it sets you a quick overview of what seems to be going on in GameStop because how to really good day today, especially with the rest of the market showing as much weakness as it did, GameStop is genuinely showing market strength, which is very, very cool to see. So from a quick technical overview looking at a six month daily chart, that's what's up here now. We can see that it's been just kind of running up along this trend line for a little while now. And it's progressively posting higher lows and higher highs, which obviously is associated with an uptrend. Now one thing that does stick out to me when looking at GameStop specifically is this trend line is really steep. What I do for things like this is I monitor the relationship between the trend line and the standard deviation channels or linear regression channels, whichever I happen to have up at",

What I do for things like this is I monitor the relationship between the trend line and the standard deviation channels or linear regression channels, whichever I happen to have up at the time. And I look at the slope in comparison. The reason for that is because when we tend to see, I guess I tend to see these kinds of more aggressive moves, they generally will be followed by a period of consolidation. And the reason for that is this is a really aggressive growth trajectory. If we take a look from fall of last year, it was around 2053. And as it close today at 3337, that's a big move for just about any company over that time frame. So this isn't aggressive move. Now GameStop does tend to move a little bit more aggressively than other things that we might trade on a more regular basis. And to demonstrate that, though, I want you to take a look both at the average daily range and the average true range. Again, for a quick reminder, average daily range looks at the move of the day. And then average true range encompasses the overnight gaps between days. So the five day average daily range is 6.47. The 20 days 6.6. And then the 90 day is 5.98. So about six. What I'm showing you is that this has become slightly",

What I'm showing you is that this has become slightly larger ranges as we get shorter on our time frame that we're looking at that tends to show a little bit of volatility entering the picture. This isn't significant because the difference between the 90 day and the five day isn't massive. But still that's something I pay attention to. And then the same thing when I look at a 90 day average true range, which is 4.65 against the five day, which is 6. So this is demonstrating that very clearly the near term time frame is more volatile from both a price general trend perspective, but then also from an actual daily price movement perspective as well. So there's not a whole lot to take away from that other than bolstering the fact that this is continuing to be an ideal candidate for something like the coverage strangle, which if you're not familiar with what that strategy is, I encourage you to check out the video in the description below. That's the introduction to this series. So they have an idea of what I'm going to be talking about in a minute. So the implied volatility is 117 very, very high and on a relative basis, 58. So",

So it tells me that we're still seeing pretty significant volatility, even though there's not a whole lot coming up like right now. Obviously, we will be coming into earnings in a couple months, but we still have a bit of time before we get there. So this is a little interesting that it's that volatile with not a whole lot on the radar right now. We can see that the 17 Jan 25 expiration is at 140.6 vol and then it dumps after that 123, 124. This is the market telling us something is going on here. I don't know what it is. I can't see it right now, but I can tell you that the market is telling you something is going on here. So it's something to be aware of. Maybe you all know there might be an announcement coming out. I haven't looked too far into it yet. I'm still getting caught up from coming back from traveling and whatnot. So I haven't done a bunch of deep dives on the typical names. I follow.

So that's kind of the cool part again about options trading is that you don't necessarily have to know the details of everything to be able to see that something's going on, which is clearly the case here. Now, Calls Q is huge. 896,900 calls against 278,000 puts. That's massive. That's almost a three time variance between these. It is essentially three times variance between these. Normally, this will hover around two. So there is undoubtedly a lot of action coming into the call side. And I want you to notice the colors of these little rectangles. You see how they're like that neon blue that neon blue is 17 jam. The same expiration that seems to have really high IV. So one of the reasons why 17 Jan might have elevated IV compared to the others, at least part of it will be because of this because there's so many options in that expiration on a relative basis. Let's take a look. 17 Jan has over half of that options chain. So if we look at all series, there's 897. And if we take a look at 17 Jan by its",

Now it might be confusing because the colors change when I flip back and forth, but now it's the purple that is 17 Jan. So I find that generally interesting. Now let's talk about the trade that's sitting right now after some adjustments today. And I want to walk you through what I did and why now. First things first, following up on I got to move this over a little bit so you could see here. So following up on the stream from Saturday, when we did the GME stream, I had asked what allocation should we use? I originally had earmarked 15,000 because from prior conversations that seemed to have been closer to like an average game stop holding size. And then when I did the poll on this Saturday, it was 25K was a little over half of the submissions for people. So I've bumped up the allocation to 25K. And I'll continue to modulate this as we go.

Right now, if you just pretend over here, I have a bucket of game stop shares relative to my overall portfolio that's by and hold designs just sit there. For this exercise, what I've done is grab a portion of this. And this is the allocation that I'm using. So the 200 shares are part of this broader holding that I've alluded to before. But when I'm manipulating this going forward like today, I am not going to continue tapping into this existing pool of shares because that doesn't represent the actual strategy and what it would be like to actually run the strategy as of today. So for example, when I bought the 100 shares today in game stop at 3223, I've added more. This is a net new add to the portfolio. So I just wanted to be really clear as we're going forward.

Because if somebody's trying to figure out what I'm doing, they're like, well, I don't have shares like this to be able to pull from, which I understand. It wouldn't be a great example.

And we have two different explorations now of short puts. These are cash secured. We have the 21 Feb, 28. We have two of those. And we have the 10 Jan, which is this Friday, the 32s. So notice the difference between these two. This is literally a 3DTE trade against, I think this is using different years. That's probably why it's confused. Yes. So this would be 24s when it was entered. That will fix that. And you can see this is really short term. And it's also a much higher delta. I entered this one at a 25 delta, entered this one at 44 delta. What am I doing here? I'm actually trying to get assigned. I'm putting on a trade that is essentially at the money with the expectation of getting assigned. That's the game plan right now. So if we flow into expiration and I get assigned on these, great. If I don't, that's okay. I'm going to lay them out for the next week at the money again. And this is a way for me to receive a pretty healthy premium relative to the time frame, right? Because take a look. This is giving me 2.87 per contract for a 52-day trade. This is giving me 95 cents for a",

This is giving me 2.87 per contract for a 52-day trade. This is giving me 95 cents for a 3-day trade. But it's because it's such a higher delta. So on a relative basis, this is paying me really, really well. And this goes back to that example. I was just giving you, we go back here to this up here. The volatility is very high. So that's why I'm not buying the shares outright. As I typically would, I did already to start scaling up. Because I was grossly underscaled. But instead of buying 200 shares or 300 shares, I chose to buy 100 shares and then sell at the money puts with the intention of getting assigned, but I'm going to capitalize on the volatility until that happens. And then we will continue to play the game. Now, the other thing I'm going to do is probably sell one more short call. So I have 300 shares and I only have one short call. So it's a 3-1 ratio, which is about good for a longer term holding. For something like this, I really want to capitalize on this volatility while it's here. So to do that, I will ratchet up that ratio a little bit. So it'd be at a 2-3 or 3-2, depending on what",

So I would have 300 shares against two short calls, maximum 200 short sales. And the intention is not to get assigned on those short calls. So they would be managed against the long shares via aggressive management, meaning I'm paying close attention to it. I'm not just letting it go and seeing what happens so that I don't get assigned. The risk is that I could get assigned early. That is a thing, especially if something like GameStop squeezes while I'm in doing this. And I have short calls. There is absolutely a potential for somebody that's being squeezed that has those calls to exercise them early. That's the risk that I run and that's why I'm not trading it at a 1-1 ratio. I don't want to unwind the whole position. I don't even want to unwind 2-3. But I want to make sure that I'm trading in and out of this thing so that we can generate as much money as we can based on where GameStop started the year, which I'm going to track right here.

We were sitting on a total PL of 3 grand on again, total allocation of now 25K. It was 15K. Right before this. So this really is starting to progress pretty well.
