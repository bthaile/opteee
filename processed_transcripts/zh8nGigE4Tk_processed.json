    "text": "what's up outliers quick market update specifically on GameStop actually I'm going to start doing a few videos per week covering a couple different covered strangles that I trade and as we discussed in the introduction video specifically for GameStop I have an allocation of the portfolio that I'm using to trade a coverage strangle in GameStop and then I also have other ones in some leverage ETFs ibit for Bitcoin and those will be separate videos so the goal for today is to walk you through some updates on the position as it sits you a quick overview of what seems to be going on in GameStop because had a really good day today especially with the rest of the market showing as much weakness as it did GameStop is genuinely showing Market strength which is very very cool to see so from a quick technical overview looking at a six-month daily chart that's what's up here now we can see that it's been just kind of running up along the trend line for a little while now and it's progressively posting higher lows and higher highs which obviously is associated with an uptrend now one thing that does stick out to me when looking at GameStop specifically is this trend line is really steep what I do for things like this is I monitor the relationship between the trend line and the standard deviation channels or linear regression channels whichever I happen to have up at the time",
