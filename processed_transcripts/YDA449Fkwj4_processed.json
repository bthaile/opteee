I have essentially read all of his books, which are fantastic reads. We'll talk a little bit about those in a little bit. But first and foremost, you and first. Thank you for taking some time to chat with us. And then secondly, welcome to the conversation. Great to have you. Thanks very much for having me. I'm always always delighted to give my all considered opinions on things. So this is great. I'll talk about options. All day. It's actually really cool though that you feel that way because you know, I feel like a lot of people once they figure out their way, sometimes they don't want to share quite as much and they just want to do. So I think it's just really, really awesome that in addition to being able to do something you are actively trying to share information about it, which is just kind of incredible. So with that is the background. I've read, like I said, all of your books, but for the people that are listening in that might be coming across you, maybe for the first time. I would love to start with like, how did you get into trading? Why trading? Obviously, I know that you have a very technical background. But what led you into the world of trading",

Obviously, I know that you have a very technical background. But what led you into the world of trading as compared to any other avenue open to you? Well, actually at the time, I didn't think there were any other avenues open to me, which is sort of why I fell into trading. I'm from New Zealand originally and New Zealand does not have a history of trading in the same way the US does. There are historical reasons for that in terms of the way the stock market was structured and also taxation laws. It made it much cheaper for people to speculate on property rather than stocks. So I don't know when you're anything about stocks. I didn't know anything about stocks. I did my PhD in England. I always wanted to be a physics professor, always thought I was going to be until I figured out, hey, I didn't really like doing what academics spend most of their time doing. And I probably wasn't good enough to get the sort of job I wanted. Academias brutally competitive and I was probably looking at three or four postdocs before I got a permanent position. And that permanent position probably wasn't going to be Caltech or MIT. So at that point, I started looking around and I remember",

So I didn't use a computer for my PhD. It was very much old school, you know, pencil and paper mathematics. So Nick Leeson at the time did me the favor of blowing up bearings, bang, which was the oldest English merchant bank. So that was big story over there. And so the popular press was talking about it and explaining these things called derivatives. And then they said, and these things are now being placed by PhDs and mathematics and physics and they're called rocket scientists. So I was like, oh, probably could do that. So I started going for interviews based on that. It was really just a matter of timing and what I heard about. And I kind of thought, sure, I like sort of making bets so I can do numbers.

Obviously, there's way more than that. But why options? Okay. So I just want to be very clear. I had no idea what I was doing at this point.

So I could have ended up quite easily in a completely different spot. I see.

And if you could shed a little light on the institutional side and what it's actually like for them. Yeah, okay. So first it's not just retail people who like to blame something else. A professional trading disc is full of the biggest crybabies you've ever heard. Nothing's in their fold. It's always the technology. It's always someone else who use something toxic order flow. No one can complain like traders. So that's something retail has got down very well. Okay, they learned that as well as the first. I think a couple of the big misconceptions are what the professionals do is a completely different job to what retail guys do. It's in the same space, but it would be like comparing. This is an analogy on this breathing up so it might be terrible. It's like comparing a card dealer to a card designer. They both work in the order space. But it's a completely different job. retail have to go out and sort of scan the whole world for little niches that they can make money in. And they typically have to jump from thing to thing because none of these things last very long.",

Your option and equity options market maker. You will then spend the rest of your trading career doing that. You become a very, very specialized in one thing as opposed to retail who are jack of all trades and jumping around. And that's one of the reasons retail is so much harder because because you have to reinvent yourself for a little time. And professionals don't.

There's all the reason the pros do it is because they're doing it easier game. I mean, they have the costs and the capital backing to run these very, very low margin trades at very big size and make money. Most of the things pros do the retail can't do because it's too expensive. Like you can't do dynamic hedging and an option as a retail guy. You'll just get eaten alive by costs. That kind of thing. So I think that's the biggest misconception. The other things and all the things which I've gone about in the past that a lot of retail like to blame market makers from manipulating market. Market makers who know abilities and manipulate anything. A market maker is completely at the mercy of income or a flow. They are the last people to have any control over the market. And only when you see something like a stock getting pinned an expiration. It's normally hurting the market makers. The market makers are doing that.

No, it's made it so much easier for retail because they've reduced costs. I'm old enough to remember when stocks were trading on the New York Stock Exchange and they were eight for the dollar.

Okay. So. That idea of stop hunting. I don't even know if it really goes on much anymore. That was a thing. 30 years ago. But the futures markets were a lot thinner. 30 years ago. And. The futures market makers and high frequency trading because high frequency trading is basically just using all the tricks that the old guys use. There's nothing new in high frequency trading. It's basically just futures trading circa 1995. Done fast. The better. It's a very different game from options. What options the bed asks Fred is incredibly wide.

But I wanted to get your thoughts on that thought process. Yeah. Okay. So what basketball, right? If you're a rec league player, you are playing the same game as the NBA. You're just playing a lot worse. Whereas retail traders are doing a have to do different things to the pros.

The other thing is, if you take a firm, one of the big options trading firms like in a basketball home, they'll have hundreds of tech people and faults. It's a team effort. So, you know, you as a retail guy might have a garch model that you programmed in VBA or Python. But Susquehanna has a garch model that 50 people have been working on for the last 20 years. Even if you try and do that, it would be the same as the rec league player stepping on the court with Steph Curry. It's just at that point, just ridiculous. You're going to lose.

And I think it's a really interesting concept because for anybody listening in, the way that you describe it is the most pragmatic in my opinion. And I think it's a lot of traders, I think accidentally find their way into it. But they don't even really know what's going on with it or why what they're doing is working. So to feel that back a little bit, I'd love to hear how you even came across the concept of the variance premium. I know that you've been studying derivatives markets essentially back from, I think you use an example of an Italian guy. Oh, no, that was for market making. Sorry. The guy that essentially kept market making, even though his his thing up burned out. Yeah, that's actually really. America found it. Yeah, I love that. Actually, do you do mine just explaining that real quick? Because I think just to switch gears, the concept of market making one of the points you made in your book is essentially they have to make markets in order to make money. If they don't make markets, they're not making money. And you gave this really cool example about that that that approach. Yeah, it's a long time ago. I'm not sure I remember all the details.

Like if the market trends, you get run over. If you're trading against someone who knows something, you get run over. If the market becomes more volatile, you'll get run over. All you can do is collect the bit asked spread. So you have to do it as often as possible. And to the point where you have to do everything in your favor to be able to do that. So if you ever get to a situation based on inventory or technology problems where you can't trade, that is the worst thing. Because you'll still be losing money because of the inventory you've got, but you have no ability to make money. And that's the story of I can't remember what was.

And one of the things they always said was, it's a full trading saying. If in doubt hands out. Because that's a sell your selling. If you don't know whether a price is a good buy or a good sell, it's probably something you should be selling. Because they knew that the edge was always with the sell. And they know the edge was and math wasn't there, the days are wasn't there. But they knew that options were overpriced. And they knew what it's been since then is really just having more data to back up that idea. And that's essentially what I've basically been trading my entire career. And I think that's one of the things you can do as a retail person, but you could do this. You either have to jump around from thing to thing. Or you have to become an expert in one thing.

But not all stocks go up at the same rates. Some stocks are better than others. There's value stocks since more cap stocks in different sectors. There are still some ways to break down the variance premium. And one of them is just the fact that the implied volatility has characteristics on its own. And you can trade that through the VIX futures. Like very easy example before a timed event of uncertainty. So you've got an uncertain outcome at a given time, like an election. The VIX will almost always go up and then it will always collapse. So there's a very simple trade there. Like before the event, you buy the VIX right before the event, you short it and then you cover it. Exactly when you do it depends on the events. You have to do a bit of work. You know, if a FOMC it might be five minutes for an election. It might be two weeks. You know, I can't tell you those numbers. I'm not calling them back. I just don't know.

Whereas very little that works is actually a secret because there aren't that many things that really work. So that work tend to have worked for a long time. Hence there are generations of people who've been doing them. If they were like pass trading that works. And 35 years ago it might have only been one small group of traders in you about it. But now I can type in pass trading into Google. Well, I can find a YouTube course that teaches you how to do it. Probably not well, but you know what I mean? It's like the stuff that works. It tends to be pretty well known now. So I can't. Well, I'm not going to tell you everything I do. I can tell you literally 90 of what I do. And it's not going to make any difference to when I make money or not. Well, I think there's value in that too to be completely honest.

I feel like a lot of people that I've talked to about their relationship with volatility trading and myself specifically was I would try it. But hedging would eat me up.

And if your thoughts on like an optimal hedging periods, I know you've talked about the delta bands before. But I'm curious if the change in commission structure has changed your thoughts on, you know, what retail, what could be optimal for retail trader, obviously completely dependent on the individual trader. Yeah. Okay. So I haven't done the actual numbers for this. So I'm guessing. I don't think the elimination of the headline commission charge is going to be enough to do it. Right. You can ask spread in like for example, you know, 300 stocks going to have a dollar bit ask spread. I mean, you know that and if you want to hedge, you are paying that spread. Right. I have this idea that well, I need to buy it. So buy it on the bed. Now that's not hedging. Once you need to do a trade, you need to do the trade. So you have to cross that spread.

So I doubt that that's going to be a doable thing. Well, I would recommend instead would be. Here's one of your other problems. Let's say you want to get short SPY volatility, right? And I don't know where the SPY is right now. You know, so I don't know, three 70 or something. So you sell the three 70s travel. And then next week, the market's gone up to three 80s. At this point, you don't have as much volatility exposure because you've gone away from the strike. Right. You also have Delta exposure because you've rallied. So you would need to do a hedge. What I would recommend doing is closing your three 70s travel and then re entering a three 80s. So you've got volatility exposure again, which is what you want. And you're hedge. So you've actually sort of hedge the both components you want to you've got rid of the Delta component you didn't want and we put the whole component back on. If you do that once a week, that won't eat you alive. If you do that every day, again, that's going to become way too expensive. So you have to",

Obviously this year's a bit of an anomaly, but I think I recall reading about centralizing more indexes compared to equities outright stuff like that. I'm curious if that's still about the case or if anything's changed there. In the last few years have been a bit weird, but generally I haven't even if the last few years have been completely different, right? I will take the evidence of previous hundred years over two.

So in general, if you're looking for a high variance premium, look for things indices have the best. In general, things with a very steep volatility skew, either to the cause or over puts will have a variance premium. If there's a situation where, I'll put this short, today's options have higher variance premiums. Why? Because variance premiums are risk premium and short later options are more risky to be short. So if you think, well, I'm going to sell the two year option, just don't bother. There's no risk premium and a two year option. You can sell it if you like, but the chances of being significantly overvalued are pretty minimal. I mean, I'd rather sell a two day option. So that's where you'd look. You look for short dates. You look for indices, you look for steep skews. So there's a lot of classes of stocks that have even higher variance premiums, but you've got to do a lot of work to find them. And that's not the sort of thing you really want to do as a rule of thumb. That's kind of like building model with, or my models got, I don't know now 12 variables and it was something.

Yeah, and it's funny you were talking a little bit about the Garch models before because when again, from from you, I kind of came across those different concepts. And I was actually reading one of your papers on SSRN about the variance premiums. So I was like, you know, let me just tinker with this to see if I can even put something together. I very quickly realized how much of a lift it would be to continually optimize one of those, at least for I'm an idiot, like I'm just happy to be sitting here, you know, like I don't have the same capacity that you do to keep those things up to date. So I think with that as the backdrop, one of the ways I've heard people attempt to monitor the VRP is through essentially comparing IV implied volatility, not for you obviously for the listeners, IV to HV historic volatility and seeing how that gap is trending. And that seems like a decent back of the napkin kind of easy way to go about it. But I'm curious your thoughts on that. Or if there is a more effective way for retail to kind of analyze those relationships. You can do better than that, but it's almost",

I'm curious again for just a retail trader is there one of those scenarios that seems to make more sense again, just in general, whether it's selling straddles or strangles and then delta hedging or just trading the volatility product itself outright. Well, different things, right. If you're trading vix futures, you're only trading the implied. Whereas if you're trading a straddle, you're trading the implied versus the real price. So they're all tied in together, but they're also slightly different. Oh, here's a good rule of thumb. Everything in the volatility world's mean reversing, like everything, term structure, if it's out of whack, it's probably going to go back to where it has been skew same thing. Variant premium same thing imply ball same thing. So it's a pretty good useful rule of thumb. So even if you don't do any other analysis, if you just look at where it is relative to its historical range, that's a pretty good place to start. Certainly on the sell side, it's very dangerous to buy volatility because you think it's cheap because it can easily stay cheap for three or four years. So that is not you can decide to sell ball purely on the basis of stats. If you're going to buy ball, you need to have some sort of catalyst for why things are going to change.",

If you're going to buy ball, you need to have some sort of catalyst for why things are going to change. But anyway, back to your question. There's a couple of things retail do roll here and it comes down to not understanding where their edges. They think they can sell options and collect fatter. Fatter is not an edge. Fatter is just a measurement of what will happen over time if nothing else happens. Well, you know what other things do happen. You move around. So unless you have this price volatility, you will get that fatter. You'll collect the theta, but you'll lose because the market moves. And actually, a black shows equation. It is exactly says, face of profits are canceled by gamma losses. That is the equation. So unless you have volatility edge, there's no reason to trade options. But that idea of fatter leads to a couple of very dangerous things. The first one is selling strangles. You can sell a strangle and be completely wrong about what volatility should be and still make money in enormous amount of the time. Right. So let's say I'm selling volume at 25. This is, I'll give you real numbers. I did this recently. So remember them. I sell volume at 20. I expect it to be 20. So",

If I bought the wings that I would naturally buy if I was trying to hedge my downside, I'm reducing that to 260. I'm having the amount of money I can make. And all I've done is cat the losses.

First, if you have to only hedge the downside, because crashes up, they don't mean they could happen. But the biggest SP up move in the last 20 or 30 years has been like 7. There could be a 50 downward. So don't hedge both sides and always realize hedges are the most expensive things you can do. So if you have to do that hedge to stay in the game, it might not be a game you can whip. Much better off, just trade it small enough. So if there's some P goes to zero, I mean, you'll lose money, but you shouldn't like have to remalge your house or something. Right, you're using size to control risk. Size and diversification are much better risk control than hedges. I mean, that sort of hedge is just so expensive that you're probably better off just. You know, seriously, if that's what you have to do, probably shouldn't be playing. That I'm honestly refreshed to hear you say that because a lot of things I see new options traders and myself included. I'm one of these really fortunate people where I started trading very young. And it's because somebody just recommended investing to me. I had a single mom, so we had no money. So I scraped together what I could.",

Next, the doing the thing I said was bad, which is buying those wings, which is the most expensive thing you can do. All hinges cost money.

And I found exactly what you would expect with a strategy like that very high win rate, but the losses were overwhelming, especially in the long run. That leads me to, I have two final questions mostly just because I literally could talk your ear off and I want to respect your time. So the first to last question is, so when you're trading things like these zero DTE strategies, whether it's a short straddle, whatever the case is, what kind of risk management approach do you take with those? Is it primarily sizing that you think, and again, this is thinking just from like the retail perspective? Do you think sizing is the right answer there or once things move a little bit, then you start delta hedging? The main thing I'm curious is with like the zero DTE overlay because I think that's an interesting add-on to that kind of thought process. I think realistically sizing is the only thing you can do. And it's a very, it's a very poor risk management technique if you're only trading one thing because you have to keep your size so small",

That's the sort of, that's where a bus, I think, risk management. And that's sort of very difficult for retail to do. So again, if you, this sounds discouraging and it is, but you might just have to accept that as a retail person, you shouldn't be trading this based on that sizing rule. Because that's really the only, it's the only real robust way you're going to have of making money. Unless you price it really well and can tell me, you know, I've got five balls of energy in the money and I'm paying away half of all the edge of the wings. Maybe, but if you're paying away the same amount of all terms on each one, long term is not going to work, is it? Right, right. Yeah, I think that makes a ton of sense. Last question I have for you is what is one question I should have asked you, but I didn't. I think that's pretty, it's a pretty random question, I guess. I don't even ask you one. You're not really a Corvette family. Oh, die hard. I have, I have a 2016 C7 sit in the garage right now that I've been building for two years. It's actually funny because the Corvette is appealing to me. I",

I have, I have a 2016 C7 sit in the garage right now that I've been building for two years. It's actually funny because the Corvette is appealing to me. I used to restore cars with my uncle and the first car that I ever worked on with him was a 64 white Corvette stingray and it was so much fun. So that's essentially what I have down there. I have a thousand horsepower Corvette that can't stick on the road. It's perfect. Okay, so I have to say, I think the new Corvette is a real Mishmash ugly thing. I think it's all like a rainbow car. The C7 when it came out was magnificent, right? It was like holy crap, what is that? I really think the C3 Corvette might be one of the best five looking cars ever made. I think that would be, look, if that was a Ferrari, people would say it was the best looking car ever. But there's a lot of snobbery about the Corvette, which I just kind of implicitly said. But I don't hate Corvettes anyway. And literally, I think the C3 is gorgeous. But probably what's them is that are now 50 year old fiberglass car. You can hear them drive down the street because all the squints, they weren't made brilliantly when they were made. And that was 50 years",

I completely agree with you on the CA, I get why they did it because in order to continue competing with the pool that they want to compete with, you need the mid engine. But I'm still more of a purist than that. So I really like the front engine. I was actually one of my other favorite cars as a Dodge Viper GTS. So that's like more my general style is kind of the over, you know, VV 10 American muscle style. I'll just yeah, super addicted to them. They're too much fun between that.

Unless you really have it. No, I've got like cars, I didn't intend to have a car collection, but when you've got Italian cars, you've kind of meet a collection.

I've had that happen to me multiple times, very entertaining. That's what I want to do. Well, you and honestly, absolute pleasure to chat with you. Um, I was a big fan before we spoke, but now that I know that you're a car guy, I'm a even bigger fan. So sincerely, thank you for taking the time to chat with us, share some of your knowledge. I'd love to have you back on at some point in time. I think what you share is important because you don't sugarcoat things, but you're not like a fatalist or something, you know, like you give people, I think a very fair shake of things. And I think that's important. One of my favorite things to wrap us up is, you know, I heard you a lot of people think, like, oh, my superpower is discipline. And you know, you kind of frame that really well because you say, well, if you execute a shitty strategy, not that you said shitty, but I'm paraphrasing, um, if you execute a shitty strategy with utmost discipline, the only thing you're going to do is lose money slowly and disciplined, you know, so that's not like what's going to get people across the finish line.

And I think stuff like that is really refreshing to hear, because that's more or less, I think people need real information. So thank you so much, you know, for spending some time. And for people that want to get a hold of you, I will link to your books in the video description below. I like I said, I think they're great reads. But where else can people find you? Do you have, I know you're on Twitter newsletter or anything like that? No, I'm basically just on Twitter at the moment. I have a LinkedIn page, but I go to LinkedIn like once every six months. So got it. Twitter is the probably the easiest place. And if you can't find me on Twitter, I mean, you're probably not going to benefit from much or many other advice if you can't manage to find me. Fair enough. Well, thank you so much. I'll link to all those in the video description below. And I look forward to catching up with you again in the future. Thanks a lot. It was nice. Thanks.",
