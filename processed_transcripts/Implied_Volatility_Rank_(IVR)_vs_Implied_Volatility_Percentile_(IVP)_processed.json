    "text": "what's up to all the outliers eric here i got a video for you on using implied volatility in your options trading and then i also have a couple interesting uses that you might not know of for implied volatility so let's dive straight over and get into it now the very first thing is you have to promise me when i start flashing this first piece up that you're not immediately going to run away because it does include a formula but you have to trust me um we'll get through it i'm not going to spend a bunch of time on the formula i just want to talk about implied volatility implied volatility percentile and implied volatility rank because traders use all of them interchangeably and they're all different so it's important to understand the difference between them because in my opinion one of them is far more useful than the other two so first let's start with the heavier one again don't let the formula scare you stand your ground there it is it's actually not that bad so if you're familiar with the black scholes model that's what you're seeing here we're looking at how you calculate implied volatility for calls and puts again i'm not going to go too far into detail here i'm just throwing it in there for the people that are interested in it now that part aside let's take a look at what implied volatility is in short it simply is",
