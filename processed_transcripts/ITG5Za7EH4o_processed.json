    "text": "the best option strategy for busy traders. I went through a pretty significant portion of my trade and career on active duty in the Marine Corps, which as you probably can guess meant that I had very little control over my schedule. Yet I still traded for those six and a half years on active duty and it's by doing a lot of this. So I want to walk you through the strategy that I used and then I want to specifically get into details on how we can structure it so that it is super simple but still effective. What's up everybody? Eric here. We'll come back to all the outliers. Let's talk about trading some options. Okay. So the very first thing like I already discussed is the concept for this trade is we are willingly sacrificing optimization for simplicity. And what I mean by that is once you set up this strategy, which does take time after hours, you can literally deploy it within 60 seconds of having access to a computer for whatever the trading period is that you choose, which is the next bullet point here that it is flexible. So you can choose something as far out as six hundred eighty days plus or you could select something that's in the weeklies or something that's eleven days out. So you can select a time frame that fits your trading opportunity. What I will tell you is we want to try and keep them within",

That's our typical window that we're looking for and I'll explain why. And in case you couldn't tell from the preamble here, the strategy we're going to be talking about is the coverage triangle. So the very first thing I want to follow up with there is I'll throw a link in the video description below on how I trade the coverage triangle in depth because this is going to be a surface level overview. This is going to be way more of me telling what I think works best for me and less of the optimization aspect, which takes a lot more time because there are different ways I would trade the coverage triangle if I had more time in front of a computer. But this video is not for that circumstance. It's for the one we're talking about the business people. Alright, so what does this look like? We need to select a ticker up front. Again, I'm not going to go into scanning, screening, picking the best tickers. We're keeping it simple here. So for me, I would pick anything that you already like for buy and hold.

I already mentioned the days to expiration. The reason why I like to keep them within 45 days is multiple fold. The first one is if you take a look on a relative basis. So let's say this 45 day trade, this is using TD Ameritrade's on demand feature by the way. So this is back in time. Really right now we're looking at the market on four March 2019 because I want to walk through an example with you all. So anyways, just so that this stuff is going to look different than what it is today because this is back in time. So anyways, back in March, if we pick something that's 45 days out and let's call it a 30 delta, this 151, you're going to get 1.94. If we look at something that's 32 days out at that same 30 delta, it's a dollar and 62 cents. So you can see that there's really kind of an incremental loss and time value as we come further and further in. The real difference is you're moving slightly closer and closer to the money. So what's the point here? Data decay accelerates the most once it gets within that 60 day window. So it's important for us to try to take advantage of that when we can.",

Data decay accelerates the most once it gets within that 60 day window. So it's important for us to try to take advantage of that when we can. However, there were plenty of periods of time where I traded cover strangles that were out 90 days plus because I was at a training exercise. It wasn't a choice. So it's not an optimal outlay, but it's as good as I could get and that happens. The other thing to keep in mind is once you go beyond this 45 days, notice what happens to the expiration. So we have something we have weak lease here, then we go to monthleas and quarterleas. As you go further out in time, liquidity in just the number of options, chains available to us changes. So the short answer here when it comes to DTE and Delta and strike for days expiration for both the short put and short call, I'm going to be looking ideally 60 days in typically somewhere between 20 and 30 or I'm sorry, 20 and 40 or Delta and strike on the short put. It's going to be something between a 15 and a 35 delta more often than not. The reason why I select those is to capitalize on the variance risk premiums. There are slight differences based on the expiration, but we're keeping it simple.",

    "text": "Delta and strike on the short put. It's going to be something between a 15 and a 35 delta more often than not. The reason why I select those is to capitalize on the variance risk premiums. There are slight differences based on the expiration, but we're keeping it simple. So anything between there is fine. And the strike price, I'm talking about this more specifically for the short calls. I'm less concerned with the Delta on the short calls once the trade is on because once we have the short calls against long stock, I'm not really using Delta to select my strike. I'm using the strike price against whatever my basis is, which I'll show you the beginning of an example, which we'll get into later, but let's say if I buy 100 shares of or 200 shares of IWM at 100 and I sell a one, I'm picking this 105 call based on the relationship to my basis here. I'm not picking it because it's a whatever Delta. The main thing is I don't want to have upside risk. So I'm going to avoid selling short calls below my basis because they just turn into a problem more often than not. Again, we want this handspray relatively easy. The overall way that this strategy can roll out is once you refine it, literally you put the trade on, you come back after expiration, you see what happened, and then you adjust. That is it.

So that's why I select the Delta's and the strike prices based on that. We'll talk about management in just a second. I want to talk about some of these optional components. So like I said, we are prioritizing simplicity. When I'm laying out here is probably one of the absolute simplest versions of this strategy that we can have. But if you have a little bit of time, you can start layering in just a little more detail. It's a little more time consuming, but it can have really significant impacts on our profitability and the strategy. So for example, we can integrate things like using moving averages, linear regression channels. So to follow that example through, if I pop over to the chart and I say, okay, I see the 150 day in the 50 day, these are really the more important moving averages again for a simpler strategy for me. I, as you can tell, I use four moving averages because in my day to day, normally I have more time I can do this. So I am a little more specific on what I like. But in this case, again, keeping it simple, I would use 50 150. If",

If it falls below the 150 or 200, I would consider either flattening or waiting to add risk until the 50 flat ends out. So if we follow that move here, so we have the 50 that's trending, it fell below the 50. So right now, let's just pretend we were now paused, whatever position we have on were paused. And then price falls below the 150. Now I'm not really wanting to add risk until I see the 50 flatten out. And as you notice, it's not flattening out, it's not flattening out. And then in here, it starts to flatten out. So a couple of things happen. You're going to have some risk on for this move unless you flattened, which is a choice. But it essentially keeps you from getting ran over on the way down. Now, we didn't bottom ticket. What I mean by that is we hit the low and you miss out on this move from 125 81 all the way back up essentially to 140. That is the lack of specificity, but that's why",

We're picking very simple moving average protocols, but there's going to be a little bit of delay in when they, when they trigger the other thing is linear regression channels. So one of the things I like to do is in the same exact example, I would integrate once it starts getting below a minus one and especially a minus two linear regression channel, I probably would add a little bit of risk and the way that I modulate that risk is through scaling. And I'll talk about that in a second, but you can use technical analysis just like that in really, really simple ways to help optimize the performance with just a little extra time added or you could say, I don't have time for that. And that's also fine. It will still work just fine. And then the last one is rolling. You can choose to roll options. I have plenty of videos on that where you could choose not to.

It really doesn't matter, but that is another way you can optimize the profitability of these trades. I just rolled a trade recently to increase my overall profit potential by a few hundred dollars. I have the time, so I did it, but you don't have to if you don't have the time. Let's talk about how this actually looks, the management. So we talked about identifying the ticker that we like, right? So we have that. We're going to sell a cash secured put. There's two scenarios that happen. Either you get a sign on that cash secured put or you do not. That's it. If you don't get assigned, you can just sell another cash secured put. If you do get assigned, there's now two more choices available to us. We can sell an additional cash secured put if we want to add more risk or we can sell an uncovered call provided we can sell that short call above our basis. You know what you're saying? Eric, why uncovered? It's because we don't want to cap our upside potential. So our PL graph of a normal covered call will have a flat top at some point when your long shares are equal to the short shares tied into the short call.

When you're using a hands-off strategy, not capping your upside is very, very important.

And this is one of those details that makes a big difference. And then on that uncovered call, if you're assigned, it just means you're going to sell the shares at that price.

Okay, last thing I want to talk about are these couple scenarios. And then I want to give you an example. So in these scenarios, if the stock lands between your strikes, meaning the short call and short put, you just keep doing what you're doing. You just reload, come on back. If the stock is above your short call, you're going to lose the shares, go back to selling more short puts to get the risk back out there. If the stock is below your short put, you're going to buy additional shares at that strike price, keeping the premium. That's it. That's how this whole thing works. So this is one of the best possible ways to optimize a buy and hold portfolio. So let's take a look at an example here. Let's say we have a hundred thousand dollar account, IWM's training around a hundred bucks. We decide to include some scaling. I think it's a really smooth way to make sure that you have room to adjust your basis if we're in a prolonged down move.

So or examples, some scaling protocols you might consider, you could have an initial outlay of 70 and then you can have whatever scaling details you want on the way down, but the main thing is the initial. So what this means is on this one hundred thousand dollars account, you can use up to 70 on your first trade. That's if we are greater than 20 away from all time highs in the underlying. Why do I select this? It's because the propensity when we're near all time highs is you have much farther to move down than when you're near all time lows. But this is important to remember using the moving averages is part of this thought process because something that is decreasing can keep on decreasing for a long time before it slows down. So you don't want to run out of money too fast. So the other thing you could do is if we're not greater than 20 off of all time highs, your initial trade is up to 50. So that means you can use up to 50,000 dollars on your initial trade. Okay, great. That's just an idea. I have slightly different variations.

So on the initial trade, we're going to buy 200 shares at 100, 20K. Then we're going to sell to open two of the 95 puts at a dollar. So we're going to collect 200 bucks and then we're going to wrap up another 19K. Essentially, we're just taking whatever the cash security amount is for this. That gives us that 200 credit.

The more short calls I sell up run, the more money I get, the lower my future profit potential. The other thing, the closer my short call strike is to my actual basis, the more money I'm going to collect up front, but the less total profit potential the trade will have. You got to pick whatever's right for you. The next thing is that'll bring in a dollar. So it's a 100 credit. So overall, I brought in 300 in total credit on the initial outlay of 39,000.

So what do we do with the remaining money that's not being tied up in the trade? So we have 61,000 that's tied to this that we're not using. You have some choices. You could use more of it. If again, if you're a typical buy and hold investor, you're using most of it anyways. Because if you're a buy and hold investor, you have to buy the stock and that's all the capital being outlaid. So it's same, same. The other thing you could do is if you have the time, you can set up box spreads. You can use box spreads on the remaining 61,000 in this scenario to earn the risk-free rate while the rest of it's being used. There are lots of ways to structure this, but the name of the game is keeping it simple. You should be able to log in to the platform. You should place your trades. It takes less than 60 seconds straight up. You come back not midweek, not mid month after expiration. If it's set up like this, it doesn't matter",

You come back not midweek, not mid month after expiration. If it's set up like this, it doesn't matter what happens. You just come back to see what happened so that you can make the necessary next steps in the strategy. If you want to be a little more involved, that's when we look at things like having more detailed scaling protocols based on volatility off of all time highs, moving averages, technical analysis, things like that. You can also start integrating rolling to make sure that you're increasing your absolute maximum profit potential. But all of that optimization starts to add a little bit of complexity here and there, which may or may not be for you. Overall, you don't need it. You can trade something just like this pretty effectively. I doubled this with my ratio leap diagonals and those are most of the strategies I trade while I was on active duty in the Marine Corps because I didn't have the time. So if you made it to the end, don't forget like, subscribe, be an outlier, see you all later.",
