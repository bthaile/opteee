    "text": "the best option strategy for busy Traders I went through a pretty significant portion of my trading career on active duty in the Marine Corps which as you probably could guess meant that I had very little control over my schedule yet I still traded for those six and a half years on active duty and it's by doing a lot of this so I want to walk you through the strategy that I used and then I want to specifically get into details on how we can structure it so that it is super simple but still effective what's up everybody Eric here welcome back to all the outliers let's talk about trading some options okay so the very first thing like I already discussed is the concept for this trade is we are willingly sacrificing optimization for Simplicity and what I mean by that is once you set up this strategy which does take time after hours you could literally deploy it within 60 seconds of having access to a computer for whatever the trading period is that you choose which is the next bullet point here that it is flexible so you can choose some something as far out as 680 days Plus or you could select something that's in the weeklies or something that's 11 days out so you can select a time frame that fits your trading opportunity what I will tell you is we want to try and keep them within 60 days that's",
