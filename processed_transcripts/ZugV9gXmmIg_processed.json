    "text": "What's up, outliers, quick market update. And today it's a little bit of a somber one. We have some bad news. Unfortunately, our fan favorite Kenneth C Griffin CEO of Citadel, LLC. It's a real bummer to see these kinds of things come down. It's, man, Citadel securities are going to have to pay a 1 million fine for a loud jid finra rule violations. And you think like how could this happen? Right? Ken obviously cares a lot. He's a man of the people. And for me, I personally hate to see finra SEC bully people that take such good care of us. So let's just get into the details here and see what happened to, to go after our guy here. Because I mean, I might have to start a petition in his favor because this is unbelievable. It's, you got to take care of those who take care of you. So let's read through this. And I have a bunch of things we'll review with respect to this. But from the start of its consolidated audit trail, cat system, I'm just going to refer to it as that instead of that whole thing each time on 22 June 20 through 28 August 24. Citadel securities failed to timely and or accurately report data for tens of billions of equity and option order events. Let's talk about that, right? Tens of billions. I think it's like 42 billion or something like that. I mean, who doesn't make a",

So it's, it's hard for me to conceive that finra would come down so hard on somebody for making a, just a few mistakes. And you think about it. It's not, it's not like this went on for like decades, right? It's all four years. So it's like, how could we expect something like Citadel and Ken in order to get a system in place to actually fall in line with these crazy compliance metrics and, you know, market transparency. It's like, it's so unreasonable. So to hit him over a four year series of errors and something that amounts right here, right? Three types of errors accounted for 41.8 billion who hasn't made a couple errors in their time. So it feels like feels like a really harsh punishment to me. So let's continue to see the kind of errors we've made did not report zero in the leaves quantity field for certain fully canceled orders impacting 31.2 billion canceled order events applied.

See, look at this, by 22 September, Citadel Securities had remediated the 33 erotypes, the firm experienced up to 31 July. So, you know, they're trying to write their wrongs out here. So, you know, good for them, right? After remediating the 33 erotypes, they identified four additional issues. Who hasn't found another problem after you find one problem? Now, here's the deal that we all, I think, have to take a giant step back and understand. This is, this is an institution with only 64 billion in assets. It's not reasonable for them to have a functioning compliance arm that are staffed with like real people that can follow the rules, right? It's not how, how could they, you can't get that past the budget. I'm sitting here trying to pay a YouTube video editor once in a while and I can only afford to pay him once a week.

They posted only 6.3 billion in net trading revenue last year, which is down from 7.5 billion a year before. Money's got to come from somewhere. So, I mean, it's not like they're working with a bunch of assets to hire the right people. And if you look at Ken, it's like, well, what's he going to do? Right? Like, he's only 43 billion. So, if you think about what that adds up to, it's just, it's unreasonable. And I think that we actually should take a moment to get to the bottom of this and see what this would look like for them.

So, you click increased decimal places and you might think Eric, there's an error with your formula. Obviously, it's not mathing. You need to do the formulas. No, it's the formulas there. But we just actually just have to add more decimals to understand what percentage of their net worth this 1 million fine represents. So, let's just click it again.
