So we have Natalie here and I came across her like quite a few people on Twitter except she is a lot of really awesome bit coin and cryptocurrency kind of content. So I'm really excited to have you here. Thanks for joining. Yeah, thanks so much for having me looking forward to it. Awesome. So first off, I think it's always really helpful just to level set. Obviously it's your first time with us on the channel. So I thought it would be really cool just to explore your background very quickly. So people understand your perspective, your paradigm. So really two main questions. The first question is, obviously you are very focused on Bitcoin cryptocurrency space. So the first question is what got you interested in that space? Sure. So a little bit about my background. I'm a first generation immigrant. My family came to the US when I was very little from Poland and my family wanted to look another book. So are you Polish? Yeah, it's my last name. So yeah, so I was born there and came when I was very little. We immigrated to Chicago where pretty much every Polish person moves when they come to the US and my parents came in search of the American dream. They grew up under communism. So they are really passionate about a sense of freedom, especially economic freedom and the ability to move upwards for",

So they are really passionate about a sense of freedom, especially economic freedom and the ability to move upwards for social mobility. And so they thought that America would have a lot more opportunity and provide myself and my brother with a better education system and just more chances to improve our lot in life and be able to accomplish what we want to accomplish and become financially secure. So that was always drilled in my head. Like it was just this idea that you should work hard, you should get an education and you can make it like America's place where you have the chance to become whatever you want to become and you can earn money and take care of your family. And they didn't want something extreme. They didn't want to become Jeff Bezos for the yacht. They just wanted like that middle class life of a nice house, a safe suburb, a vacation every year and their kids to go to good school. So I saw them work really, really hard when we came here and they worked so hard that we were able to finally afford a house and then the financial crisis happened in 2008, 2009. And they lost everything and I had I watched them start over again. And so I think back",

You know they were too good working good, good hardworking people who paid their taxes, played by the rules and they got completely screwed by a system that they didn't even fully understand. And I always wondered like why didn't we see that coming? Why did this even happen? How could the greatest, you know, the economy and the greatest country in the world suddenly have, you know, its economy on the brink of collapse, its banking system on the brink of collapse and meeting bailout from the taxpayers. And that was just sort of, you know, ruminating in the back of my mind. And I decided to pursue a career in journalism because I've always loved storytelling and learning and interviewing people. I love conversations. And so I set off right around that same time around the financial crisis.

And so what that taught me is, you know, I spent 10 years as a reporter looking at the crises that are facing this country at a really, really deep micro level of human experience, you know, interviewing people that are facing poverty, homelessness, the politicians who claim to have the answer elections, public corruption, all of it. And what I ended up realizing is that our system is really broken and we're spending more and more money. And the problems are only getting bigger and everyone blame someone else and really for the average person life is getting more and more expensive to afford everything from housing to education. And it made me kind of frustrated because I didn't understand what the solution was and I started to feel as I, as I progressed in my career, that really nothing changes it.

And just like most people, I was super skeptical. I thought it was a scam. I thought it was, you know, some internet funny money. I didn't believe in it. I didn't understand it. But I was curious. And I ultimately knew that there was a problem. And supposedly this was a technology that might fix some of the problems we have. So I started to dig into it. Candidly I did not do most of my research until the pandemic and our market crashed and they initiated like the bazookas of money printing. And I knew that life was not going back to the same sort of financial world order that we had before. I felt like everything changed with the pandemic. And so I started to consume everything I possibly could, not just about Bitcoin, but about our economy in general, like the history of the Federal Reserve. And you know, I started following gold bugs, Bitcoin people, people who were talking about you know, macro economics and what happened in the financial crisis and what happened in 1971 with the gold standard.

And that Bitcoin is the one thing to me that I think could fix it and could assure us into a new financial order that's more inclusive, that's more based on value and is more equal because it's based on actual supply and demand economics, which we haven't had for a very long time with the manipulated interest rates and quantitative easing that the Fed takes part in. So I know this is a very long wind and answer, but basically I came to Bitcoin because I knew there was a problem and when I learned about Bitcoin, I realized that was the solution and I want to empower people to understand it so that they can opt out of the broken system into one that potentially could help them accumulate wealth and take care of their families in the future.

But the story that you share is kind of fascinating to me for a few reasons. One, obviously they're timing in just the US market was a little rough because 2008 was just brutal and obviously you know, no more about it than I do. You know, just the way that our fiscal policy was set up at that point obviously it just gives so much leeway to these banks and you started, you know, the aftermath of your view and what kind of monetary decisions they're making, you're like, who thought this is a good idea? You don't even mean. So it's interesting how that moved you towards Bitcoin. So the very first kind of follow-in question I have for you is when we're thinking about the current, you know, just monetary policy, the way that the Fed is so involved in our current fiscal policy.

I never learned it in school. I think this is, you know, it puts a highlight on how little financial literacy we have in this country. I went to good schools. I graduated with a master's at one of the top universities and I really never understood the history of money or how the Federal Reserve came to be. And these are fundamental things that affect all of our lives, right? We use money every single day. It is, you know, our most important information system. I would say it allows us to measure value in society for everything that we produce and all the services that we provide and our money is broken. And our money doesn't have actual value.

And the symptoms, excuse me, they were addressing the symptoms as opposed to the actual problem. And the problem is they're debasing our currency. They're debasing our money. They have the prerogative to print as much money as they want. And it affects the average person, the middle class, the low income earners, the savers, it affects them so much.

And then gold got centralized, involved, and they issued more paper notes than the gold that they had. And eventually they let that get away so far that we basically defaulted and had to go off the gold standard. And now we're in this fiat world where they can make as much money as they possibly want. It goes into the hands of the wealthy before anybody else. And we are getting poorer and more polarized as a nation. We used to be the world's biggest creditor nation. Now we're the world's largest debtor nation. We don't make anything. We don't make anything of value here. And that's sad. And so I now see why everyone is, you know, there's so much angst. And it's like red versus blue. Everyone has a team. Because everyone's just feeling frustrated by a system that isn't inclusive and isn't fair. And no matter how hard you work, it's like you're always on this, in the rat race or on this durable wheel, and you can't make enough. And you can't retire.

Like this is the exact problem he wanted to fix or she wanted to fix is the idea that central authority has way too much power and control over the supply of money. And as soon as they start printing too much money and debasing our currency, everybody suffers in the end. So yeah, Bitcoin fixes that. It's interesting. So one of the questions I have with regards to that, I agree with you really on the vast majority of those issues that you noted. Now one thing I am curious your perspective on though is so, or you have the opinion that really in general, the government should not manipulate its financial policy, its currencies at all, or do you think they should limit their involvement. And the reason why I asked that is I do think in certain circumstances, government intervention is actually worked for us and has made some circumstances a little less, I guess impactful common. I'm just curious, do you think that going from something where the government is so heavily involved because right now I think it's way too much? So something where essentially there's no government involvement, what do you think about that",

So something where essentially there's no government involvement, what do you think about that jump? So that's a great question. I believe in the rule of law, but I believe in that the government should not be intervening in the free markets and in the economy. So this is where again Bitcoin is the reason why I learned about these different economic theories before Bitcoin. I never understood what Keynesian economics versus Austria economics were. And I feel like over even just the last like five to ten years when I think about the stories I've covered or just like just the climate in general when it comes to the word capitalism has really changed. Capitalism has turned into a very negative work. It's associated with greed and with wealth inequality. But the truth is if you really study capitalism, capitalism is about capital accumulation, it's about saving and investing. And it is the complete polar opposite of what everyone is told to do in this country which is spent that the health of an economy in this country is based on the level of spending. And so Keynesian's believed that the government should intervene and that the government is responsible for stepping in and basically managing demand. They can manage actions of human",

And so Keynesian's believed that the government should intervene and that the government is responsible for stepping in and basically managing demand. They can manage actions of human beings. They can manage unemployment. They can stimulate the economy. They can prevent these booms and bus cycles. But arguably we've had decades of Keynesian economics and all we've had is booms and bus because the economy can't regulate itself. And so that's what really frustrates me is there's a school of thought out there that's being completely ignored and not being taught in schools which is Austrian economics which really focuses on free markets and capitalism and encourages people to save and then invest in something productive and create value for the economy. And we push all that aside in favor of taking on debt and consumers and spending. And so I truly believe like the Austrians believe that if we had an economy that was based on free markets and interest rate that basically set itself based on supply and demand as opposed to a central bank, that we would actually have more equilibrium in the economy. We would have fewer booms and bus that weren't as extreme because the market would come in and fill those gaps and holes.

That is not the way America should function. We're supposed to be you know, the paradigm of capitalism and free markets and enterprise and entrepreneurship. And now we're leading into what I believe is almost a system of authoritarianism because we have politicians coming in and saying, hey, this is based on corporate greed.

And the current marketplace, when you're referring to the market, I'm curious who that is to you because one of the, I guess, as I'm listening and synthesizing what you're saying, one of the concerns that I have in that kind of world is institutions really drive most of the marketplace right now. The retail investor has, you know, pennies to the dollar. So I'm curious how you view the markets in terms of who then starts to assume kind of pricing power and you know, controlling supply and demand. Yeah. And so this is where I believe that we don't have capitalism. We have crony capitalism where we're allowing sort of these big mass production, mass corporation entities to rise up and control our economy and our government and sit in the, you know, the pockets of politicians because that's what essentially fiat does because when the federal reserve buys treasury bonds or they make up, you know, dollars through on their,",

It doesn't go to small businesses. It doesn't go to the average person. It goes to massive corporations. What have they been doing over the last two decades? They buy back their stock and their stock prices go up. But it's not based on value or, you know, revenue or the company actually making great new products. It's based on the fact that they're buying back their shares. And the CEOs are getting richer and richer. And so again, like this is not an economy of value. It's based on ballooning asset prices. And so everything looks like it's great. But like asset prices were, weren't a very expensive stock market right now, right? SP 500 went up what 30 last year.

And then the average saver, the average middle class person is getting robbed through inflation. Everything around them is more expensive. They can't save schools more expensive housing is more expensive. And they don't have access to this easy money. So I just think the system is just getting more and more broken.

It's an interesting perspective. And I agree with you, especially the comment on kind of, I don't know, I would almost call it the bastardization about fiat currency at this point. The way that it's being deployed, I completely agree with you there. And I think about the integration of Bitcoin and the ability for a place like the United States.

And again, all of this, I think, is about education. Michael Sailer obviously was a big name over the last two years. He learned about Bitcoin because of the pandemic and the devaluing currency that he had in his reserves and in his treasury. He couldn't figure out where to put his money because bonds with inflation are yielding negative rates at this point. And so basically, what are you going to do? Where are you going to put your money? And he makes these great analogies of the fact that, you know, it's like the oxygen is getting sucked out of the room and your breathing lasts in less every single year. Your money is a melting ice cube and until Bitcoin, there really was no solution. And then Bitcoin drops out of the air like this oxygen mask and it's like, aren't you going to put it on?

But I believe it's closer to 20 to 30 percent every year. Are you getting a 20 to 30 percent raise? Are you going to put your money? Not in savings account that has a 0.01 percent interest yield. Are you going to gamble it on stocks? Well, which stocks? Do you want to put it all in Apple? What are you going to buy? Where do you put your money today? It's not safe. And so I believe that Bitcoin offers us this great savings technology and store of value and a maculate digital property that scares that no one can take from you. And I think it's incredible. So an interesting phrase that you use that I'm curious about is you say that it's safer. And I'd love to dive into that a little bit more.

And the reason for that is when I think about safety, one of the things I would consider is obviously reduction in variance, reduction in return volatility. And like you said right now, we are in a world where the only way to get a positive real rate of return is via equity markets or something else. Like an alternative Bitcoin. And when I think about some of the conversation around Bitcoin, I can see the long term safety depending on how adoption goes. But I also look at a asset that in the last six months went from what? 69,000. And right now it's hanging at like 41,48, something like that. So to me, I think about safety and I'm like, well, wait a minute, that's cut by a third and change. How is that safer to you? Yeah, so I think safety and volatility are two different things. Safety to me with Bitcoin kind of refers to the fact that I now have a form of property that no one can take away from me that I can take anywhere in the world and I can transfer value from myself to any part of the world in a matter of minutes. And no one can take that power away from me. You can't you can't take them the seed phrase out of my head, right? As opposed to this",

That's all they could take. Well, what if they had Bitcoin recently when the Taliban took over in Afghanistan, I heard amazing incredible stories of the people who had Bitcoin were able to pay for evacuations or escape the country while the banks were closed or there was a run on banks and the traditional finance system collapsed when the Taliban took over and Bitcoin was a way that they could still transact and basically pay for their families to have an escape.

So we're in the baby stages of monetization, but I would prefer to have an extremely volatile, appreciating asset that year over years just going up in value as opposed to an extremely stable, not volatile at all, asset like cash, which is collapsing in value over the last several years, right? So I can stomach the volatility. And I get that people need to, you know, use their fiat money for everyday expenses and a lot, you know, not a lot of places even except Bitcoin. And I would argue you want to hold something that's increasing in value. But ultimately, I see it as a safer place because I don't have to worry about a CEO.

So being mindful of your time, I do have two more questions. The first one is looking into 2022. What is it, what is, you know, what happens to Bitcoin? Do you see more adoption coming, especially with the Fed coming out with this interest rate manipulation, you know, we're expecting three to four rises starting as soon as March. Like I'm just curious at a very high level. What do you think's going to happen to Bitcoin throughout the rest of this year? Yeah. So I have really high hopes for Bitcoin hitting new all-time highs because ultimately, I do think that it's still correlated in some way to the traditional markets and liquidity. And what I hope everyone is learning over the last, at least year or two, is that our economy is basically addicted to quantitative easing and stimulus. It's addicted to the money printer. And as soon as they try to let off the gas pedal, everything takes, right, and goes into the red. And so unfortunately, our Fed is now between a rock and a hard place because we have so much",

And we can't service that debt if they raise interest rates meaningfully to a place where they probably should raise interest rates. They would cause a complete credit collapse and, you know, bankruptcies and the unwinding of this massive leverage that we have that's historic. That's a much bigger bubble than we had in 2008. But if we go the other way and we keep printing, then it's just evaluating our currency more. But it obviously makes it cheaper to service our debt. So pretty much, I believe that they're going to go by way of inflation. They're going to give us the headlines of inflation's good. And this is why it's good. Oh, now we're going to have price controls and they're going to try to fix things. That's a great thing. Great inflation, right? Exactly. Yeah.

So what I believe will happen is I believe they will talk about tapering. They might try to raise, you know, a couple basis points. They won't be able to. We have an election coming up. We are going to have to have green markets for that. What's that going to mean? More money printing, more devaluing of our currency. I think that that's going to help Bitcoin. Anything with liquidity is going to help Bitcoin in any time that people realize that the system is just too far gone. At this point, we are in solvent and we're addicted to the money printer and we're just going to keep debasing our currency. Bitcoin is a fantastic technology that ops us out. And I think more and more people will adopt that, both institutions and retailers. I'm so happy and grateful that we have this technology. And so I think Bitcoin, you know, once the markets are given the green light from the Fed that no more tapering is going to happen, I think they're going to run and I think Bitcoin's going to run with it.

Yeah, I think, I mean, when I think about Bitcoin, though, it's kind of boring, right? Because big daddy, J. Powell can't just turn on the printer and then just print Bitcoin. So what, what was the entertainment now? Just kidding. They should print money to buy Bitcoin. That's an interesting, it's an interesting outlook and it highlights really my last question. And it's something that I'm just personally curious about. I find that we always, at least as traders, we're always looking for relationships and correlations and how things interact with other things. And Bitcoin is a tricky one because for a while, a lot of people saw it as an inflation hedge. And then some people are saying, well, is it really an inflation hedge? So that's really the last nuance question I have for you is how do you think Bitcoin interacts with directly with interest rates? Do you think that it's something people can slowly add to the portfolio as a style of hedge? Do you think that they're too just disjointed for that to really be an observable relationship at this point? What does that look like to you? For me, and I said this recently in a news show that I was a part of, I believe that Bitcoin is a fantastic inflation",

For me, and I said this recently in a news show that I was a part of, I believe that Bitcoin is a fantastic inflation hedge. And I think that a non-zero position is the right one for everyone at this point. And everyone has different amounts of risk and volatility they can stomach. But I believe at least a 1 to 5 percent is smart for everyone. And I really try to educate as many people about it as possible because at this point, it is literally the best performing monetary asset of the last decade. It's appreciated about a million percent. The second best performer was Tesla at 15,000 percent Amazon and Apple stocks were about 14, 12 and 14 hundred respectively. SP 500 did about 300 percent over the last decade. Gold went down about 6 percent. So it's not the inflation hedge that I suppose it once was. But let's look at the last couple of years. 2019 was around 90 percent that Bitcoin went up 20, 20, 300 percent last year 60 percent inflation. Yes, they're telling us it's 7 percent. Let's look at how much assets have gone up. Let's look at the SP. Let's look at how much housing has gone up by. That's what I believe tells the real story of inflation. Tell 7 percent to the",

Inflation is a massive problem. We're being misguided and misinformed about it by the media, which is really sad. I come from a journalism background. We should be watchdogs for the government. We should be lapdogs and propagandists for the government and their policies. We should be really holding their feet to the fire. So I think that the inflation narratives, we need to actually inform people about how this is really hurting them in their bottom lines. The stimulus checks are just like a little crumb in all of the... I think it's a distraction. I think it's a distraction. I think that's just to see people. Okay, so I like to... I like to...

But I'm curious from your perspective. If somebody is like, I'm curious a bit coin, want to get started. What should they do? Yeah, so just a couple of things on that. I think education again is number one. And until you understand the problem, you don't appreciate why Bitcoin is a solution. Right? First, people should look at their financial lives. Are they making enough to be able to comfortably plan retirement or plan a future for their family, for their kids? Are they stressed out financially?

What's the rate that you got on your stocks? What's the rate you're getting in your savings account or in your 401k? What's that percentage? Now, let's compare that to Bitcoin. There are so many avenues that you can invest in Bitcoin now, but I agree with you. I think holding Bitcoin directly becoming your own bank and becoming financially sovereign is the number one. And it is a little bit technology technologically intimidating for some people because it's the idea of taking ownership and having something that's completely digital in your custody and you have to protect it. There are also other avenues where there are trusted third parties and multi-sig wallets and all of that that will help you protect your Bitcoin. But number one is just education. Look at your financial life and tell me if it's performing the way you want it to. And then let's look at Bitcoin's performance. If you want to read a book about Bitcoin, the best one out there. I've read it countless times now. Bitcoin's standard. Number one best book. It's hardly even really about Bitcoin. It's about the history of money and how our system got to be where it is and why we're struggling with some of these issues and why Bitcoin was invented. It is a phenomenal book.",

Spare the coffee that you would have had and put that money into Bitcoin and watch its performance over the next five, six, 10, 12 months. I really just believe having a little bit of exposure gets you interested and engaged doing the homework. But it's just simple things. Are you doing well financially? If not, one to five percent is pretty conservative. If it goes down, you lost one to five percent. If it does what I believe it will do, you could potentially change your life of it.
