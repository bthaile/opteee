This was the Moss I kid that was telling you with the snake. Then this is the elephant. I was telling you the more juvenile one. Thank you for letting me know Reese. We're not going to spend a lot of time doing this. I just want to show a couple since Lauren was asking. Going through Tanzania was super, super interesting, but not so much part of the safari. Getting out to the safari was super not fun. It was like literally several hours on this bumpy ass road. You just suck it up. Didn't enjoy that part too much, but like the overall experience was super fun. There is a bunch of these baboons running around and then there's a little black face monkeys. This is the cool stuff. There is a bunch of these like groupings of seemingly odd animals in some of these places. Then I have a couple photos. These ones are zoomed in super far. Those guys were far away. I have stuff",

So that dude was being hunted. And in here, I was catching photos of all these different lions. The funny thing is, is like, as you look in this photo, this one I'm showing you right now, you're kind of like, yeah, okay, there's not a whole lot going on here. But literally this field is full of animals as you look further out. And these fields are full of freaking lions. And the lions are so, so, so cool. I'll show you some pictures of them in a second. Then I like this guy, the water buffalo just because they have these birds that like to hang out on their back. And then I like this dude, because is this super sleepy cheetah hanging out next to mom? There's mom actually like doing the cheetah thing.

So I want to show you this was another juvenile elephant that was wrangling these guys. So do you notice the back of their heads? The only way you can see these freaking lions in the grass is their dark spots behind the ears. Otherwise, you literally cannot see them. So it's funny because when you're out in the serengeti, it like, you have to go pee, right? And it's like, you just hop out the truck, but you don't go that far from the truck. And one of the spots I was peeing like, I just looked out and I saw this. And they were having a bit of a standoff with that elephant that I was just showing you. Those interactions are just incredible. So like, he was just chasing him around. Oh, I actually have a video of it. Hold on. I'll kill the volume here. So he, oh shit, he was getting really, really grumpy with the lions. So take a look. This is essentially the distance that you see. So this pride had like eight lions hanging out. He was just walking along. This is one of the interesting things about this. There wasn't like a water source directly nearby here. The serengeti's huge and somehow this elephant just happened to walk across these lions and have this very interesting interaction. So you",

The serengeti's huge and somehow this elephant just happened to walk across these lions and have this very interesting interaction. So you can see that he sees them. They're all like, oh shit, lions are pretty damn lazy. They don't want to move. You see how that one got up and just like immediately laid down all conservation of energy for them. And he's like deciding how he wants to go about this. And you could tell he clearly is not scared or threatened by them in the sense of approaching them. The lions are like, yo, let me get the fuck out of here. Layers is ears out. And the interesting thing about this dude is he was by himself. The reason why the camera's so shaky is because we're moving to keep up with them. It doesn't look like they're moving that fast, but they are. So we had to like keep scooting up to keep pace with them. But anyways, super, super, super interesting interaction between those guys. And then maybe I'll show you one more, maybe two more. Because this was a cool shot. I thought of again, whatever that tree is called. I forgot the name. The the giraffes were dope.

We in Western society get so used to being comfortable and, you know, pretty much is good as you could possibly have it.

And there's only a handful of these. I don't know how many there are now. Again, this was a while ago that I took these. But this was like one of two or three that were left because of poachers. Poachers want the horns. So a lot of times what they do in the parks is they tranquilize the animal. I had a buddy that used to do this after the Marine Corps. They tranquilize the animal. They go cut the horns off so that then the poachers aren't incentivized to kill the rhinoceros. The poachers weren't trying to kill the rhinoceros because they cared about the rhinoceros. They just wanted the horns. So if you get the horns off the rhinoceros preemptively, then it's so facto decreases the need or desire to go cut us horns off. But it's super rare to see them with the horns like this. They just very, very, very rare. So yeah, have done so far. That was super, super cool, really, really fun. The elephants and stuff gets so close to the vehicles and that's pretty humbling.

Now, like I was talking about with GameStop in the beginning, the resilience of GameStop, I do think is pretty noteworthy because GameStop right now is behaving a little more idiosyncratically than I would have expected from the rest of the market. And that's actually a good thing. That's actually led to a couple of adjustments I've had in my position, specifically increasing the allocation because these lines, these are the same lines I've shown you a million times now. I'm not drawing anything new. And if I do, I would tell you. But what I'm trying to postulate here is where are the different areas of support and resistance where people are interested in transacting? That's what I care about. Now, a couple of things stick out to me here. This break below 22 was pretty aggressive.

    "text": "resistance where people are interested in transacting? That's what I care about. Now, a couple of things stick out to me here. This break below 22 was pretty aggressive. And then I actually remember quite a while ago, where I was talking about at least where I perceived the potential near-term floor being around this 20 and a half handle, specifically because that's where a ton of volume has transacted. And a lot of people didn't like when I said that. They, I actually got an insignificant amount of hate mail or even talking about GameStop, respectively, going down towards this handle. And as you all know, I know that the community is so used to hearing people just trying to push down GameStop. They refer to the Michils. So I get all that. It doesn't offend me, but it does give me some idea of sentiment. And my angle obviously is completely different. My angle is just trying to look at it objectively from as what I promise you guys from a traitor's lens. So the reason why I think this 20 and a half handle is important is because so far it has held. And this now does serve as what I would consider to be the near-term price floor depending on what news comes out. Now this pullback doesn't look crazy to me. The stock, this is the weird thing about this stock, is that it doesn't inherently look like it's moving a ton at any given",

The stock, this is the weird thing about this stock, is that it doesn't inherently look like it's moving a ton at any given point in time, right? Because of the scale, but and it's because of these moves that distort everything. But if you actually look at the existing scale here, these are still pretty significant moves that it's having. So if we convert this to a log scale, you'll see that this is actually a really healthy move. So this kind of price behavior, I actually think is pretty strong news for GameStop specifically. Now we know that we already talked about its earnings. There wasn't a whole lot that stuck out to me from there. But I want to take a look now at some positioning and I want to take a look at what the broader market is kind of talking about with respect to GameStop. So one of the things I am going to do really quick is literally pop through the news and see just anything that looks interesting. We can go back, we don't really have to go back that far. Let's see. So 15 of April, Cohen, ramse up 1 billion bet with margin-long, we know this GameStop's 150 yearly jump. I didn't read this one yet. So this is talking about its annual price performance",

I didn't read this one yet. So this is talking about its annual price performance and some of the recent breakdowns. These kinds of lines are always funny to me, like outperforming tech behemoths such as Nvidia, Tesla, Microsoft. This is really just stuff. It's like talking points. It's designed to sound impressive, but comparing the price behavior of something like GameStop to Nvidia is just crazy. And the reason why it's crazy is just the scope and scale. What would have to happen in order for GameStop or I'm sorry for Nvidia, for example, to make these kind of price movements is just tremendous. So it's not good, bad, and different. The reason why I'm pointing this out to you is this is just pure fluff. This doesn't mean anything. It doesn't actually provide usable context, not a competition between these. It's completely different stuff. I just want you to be able to identify pure fluff when you see it. This is that. The combination of factors, working the company favors.

This says that there is some pretty big trade activity. What is this? Now, this isn't big. It's weird that they're calling a 40,000 trade a whale. This is actually a lot of like pretty small trades comparatively. LVS is a pretty big trade, but that's about it from here.

Because this honestly is a little bit more of like a vote of confidence more than anything. The fact that Cohen is expanding this far into game stop, it does demonstrate a level of confidence.

So much, much more significant accumulation there. So that all makes sense to me. I love these ones. These are my favorites. These are just other like bullshit meaningless posts, to be honest, pure fluff. If you did this 20 years ago, here's how much you'd have today. It's literally always a complete waste of everything to care about those. Okay. So now let's look through a couple other things though. I do want to see what's the latest here. Interesting. So overall volume looks to lean a little more, here, so that's actually kind of interesting. Let's take a look on, I don't want to actually know, yeah, let's look on opX. So all I'm doing is I'm eyeballing really quick to see if anything in here is like sticking out. There are some actually pretty sizable trades going on as compared to the historic behavior. So that'll be worth taking a look at. Let's take a look at that vol overall. And I want to see how this has",

Let's take a look at that vol overall. And I want to see how this has changed. Okay. So the tail came down. No surprise. So my guess is probably... Oh, interesting. Let's go to the beginning of the week. What was that? The 14th. Yeah, so frontfall is still running super high. Super strong risk premiums as per usual. This thing that you see here is the entire reason why the covered strangle is such a great strategy for GameStop. It's literally for exactly what you see here. It really does maintain quite strong risk premiums fairly pervasively as you can see here. This period obviously would trail down. The reason why this period would trail down is because of the expansion and the move that you saw. This is all the way back in March. So it's not really as as pertinent to like right now. Vol still remains generally elevated. Okay, so let's take a look at just overall positioning. Yeah, nothing's sticking out to me there. Let's take a look at this. Interesting. So this is actually a little more aggressive or delta decay and then Vanna. Yeah, nothing that's surprising to me there. Okay. Let's see if there's any new readings. I don't see anything.

Yeah, see like this is a big trade. This is a really big trade. 853,000 trade 61 DTE. The calls came in. Those are at the bid. That's a little harder to discern. If we're being honest and the reason for that is because we would innately assume that those would be sold calls, probably part of like a covered call. Style position, but we don't know with certainty that that's the case, but that would be the assumption. Now selling these deep in the money like this is for a few different reasons. This can be part of actually building a synthetic position. What's the total amount of data? Where are these at? 620? Yeah, so this looks like a synthetic. The selling the call this far in the money, there's really no extrinsic value. You're not even being able to really capture the risk-free rate on that. That looks like a synthetic position being built. Yeah. The largest trade looks to be more on that. Overall, really bullish premium, short premium for the 25th expiration, which",

Notice how light the tails are here. The 125 is only 33K there, which is actually really, really light comparatively. This is that big trade you saw come through with the tens, which again is a synthetic. You can't really read into that here. It doesn't add much value to us in our overall analysis. Let's take a look. Here. Same same. So what we saw on Friday was broadly bullish net net. 13 mil against 11 mil. So broadly bullish. All right. Let's chill. A little surprised that the options volume this past week picked up the way it did. Again, not just the top size being 800K, but some of the rest of these I actually think are quite large. I mean, there's periods where just getting something over six figures was otherwise what we would have considered to be a larger trade. So that I do think is worth identifying.

I think we talked about that previously. We actually spent a little time exploring the rationale and like the different reasons why, but obviously you can see some of that coming through via the margin loan and stuff like that.

All of these came through it like the same time, but this isn't anywhere close to a 5,000 block. So that's why I'm trying to understand where the 5,000 is coming from. Like that's not the case. At least for what I'm looking at now, there might be more here to look at. But I don't see it. So if you have any other details unlike where that came from, yo, could you drop that in the discord? Yo, yo, rollo so that we could look at it together? Or you can shoot me an email or whatever. I don't know where you're connected to me from, but I would absolutely love to take a look. Yeah, I just, I don't see it. And as you can tell, I don't look at it as when I can't see it that it means that whatever it is is wrong. It just means the first thing I try to do is understand it a little bit better, but right now I don't see it. Maybe the 500 blocks, but even that was both different strikes.

But yeah, this doesn't mean anything. I don't think at least in my opinion, let's see what else there might be in here. Is he saying 5000? Oh, because he's talking about, it looks like he's talking about like the total volume maybe. Maybe that's the case for the 32s. I see it better now. So what he was looking at was the candle volume, the problem with looking at the candle volume like that, those you can't, like that doesn't inherently mean, but he just means that there were transactions there. So that doesn't really surprise me that much. And when was this? This was on the 10th of April. So let's take a look. Here. Yeah, I don't, I don't think there's anything here to be honest. Because these are also pretty far out of the money. On the 10th of April, these were trading at 24. So these would be six strikes, depending on which. It's a little far out of the money, I think.

That doesn't, that looks like something very different to me. Because for those that don't know, we went through a pretty broad exercise a while ago, where we literally went through all of the trade history for the cat. And there's a bunch of things about this that leads me to believe. It doesn't, it doesn't look like anything even remotely close to the cat. The first one has to do with the sizing. The second has to do with the strike selection and the DTE. But there's a bunch of things about it that looks off to me from that. That's not to say that it couldn't be. As always, I will always, always, always provide the disclaimer. Because there are things that do line up marginally. But I mean, even the trade size is so light. That means that I shouldn't go back to that. Ortier area? Ortier area? And so there are a lot of things. I'm sorry. Follow-up would be important. I just cannot pay attention to third terms.

Why suggestion to them? If you're interested about that, interest. Remember, volume represents what traded on that day. Open interest reflects the actual contract sizing, contracts being opened and then being maintained. So the fact that there was that much volume on the day tells us that the contracts transacted that much, but it doesn't inherently mean that it's opening or sustained contracts. Like it clearly, a good number of those were actually closing contracts because if we take a look at the sizing that actually stuck it's sub sub 5k. So yeah, interesting nonetheless. I absolutely say interesting nonetheless, but yeah, thank you. Thank you for showing me because again, like I was saying, it makes it makes way more sense now. I at least understand the lens that they're looking at it from. Yeah, cool. And then I think there was something else you guys were saying about 420. Okay, along with the 420 date. Is there talk to me about the 420 date? Is that just when you guys typically hear from the cat? Does he normally post on 420? Just like a troll? Or is there something else tied to that?

Yo, Yo says I thought it might be the end of a swap cycle. I don't, I just don't think there's anything there. I don't, I don't think that the cat is sitting here posting about the swap cycles. I think the swap cycles really is a, I think it's really a rabbit hole that yields very little if any predictive value. And I spent a while talking with Newton to understand what his thoughts were on the swaps. And we spent actually a while together pretty early on on on a couple calls going through the tracker line by line trying to overlay the various swap explorations. And the problem with swaps and the problem with any custom product like those is when a swap comes due, there is nothing that prevents us at all from simply writing a new swap, just extending it. That's one of the difficulties here. Unlike an options market where everything is open ended, you can see the volume, you can see if people are rolling out, you can see what's happening. Common expiration cycle and options. And you know that there's actual settlement also on the table because it's standardized because swaps are not that they're effectively a black box. And it's literally impossible for us to really pull much usable data from the swaps other than knowing they exist because",

And it's literally impossible for us to really pull much usable data from the swaps other than knowing they exist because a swap expiration date really doesn't mean anything. There's absolutely nothing that says that that swap literally can't just be rolled into a new swap. And because it's not standardized. So I think that that's an important thing to keep in mind when we're looking at the swaps. Haggit says FDDs all time high, XRT. Now the FDDs I think is a different story. The FDDs I do think shows something. Again, I think there's two different lenses to look at this from. I think the FDDs shows something from a activity slash market function basis. Now what they show with respect to like a tradable event, I think that that's a little bit muted as well. The reason why I say that is because again, we did a similar exercise going through periods where we found FDDs and try to track the highest FDD timeframes that we could find. And in doing that, we still see instances where price doesn't necessarily do anything. So because of that, you can't necessarily pull high high FDDs yielding some sort of price behavior. So if we take a look at FDDs here, like this is a good example. FDDs here, we start",

But then price doesn't really go on to do a whole lot. Now we can go down this list and kind of do this pretty regularly. Like this is another instance where this metric was really, really high on a relative basis and price really didn't do that much. So one of the problems that I find with the broader analysis people do with this kind of stuff in the broader community is we really do kind of abandon basic research protocols where we don't start the exercise trying to prove what we want to see. But we start the exercise with ideas on what inputs we think might impact the market. And then simply observing the price performance, volume performance results of those inputs. And then objectively analyzing the output. So because I've downloaded this whole thing and I've done different kinds of correlation and regression analysis on five day, three day, two day, one day, follow on price movement based on percentiles of FDDs or what we would expect to see some sort of hypothesation of shares.

So yeah, I still think that there's a lot going on. And the market activity element of this is important to track because I think it starts to show this game of naked shorting and some of the ways that they're able to successfully manipulate and navigate around requirements for actual locates and stuff like that. But I also think with everything that we've seen so far, the probability that there are like these massive shorts that are just still out there sitting open, I do struggle to see that. Why that would be the case given how low GameStop is gone during these different periods. And with the prevalence of shares to be able to close out that risk would be probably advantageous.

And it's pretty clear at this point like the company's not necessarily going out of business, right? Like the company is pivoting. We can see it. So the idea of just holding on to these short positions, which still do require money literally for decades, hoping that the company ends up going bankrupt really just doesn't make financial sense for those kinds of places. If they thought that that would happen, they would just pile on the shorts as they thought it was actually going down. But it's like super clear that's not happening. A company that has the position in that GameStop does is not going out of business for the foreseeable future unless the CEO just rolloly fuxx it up, which I don't think Cohen would do.

Yo, yo, roll O says, but the price would have risen drastically if they had closed. Not necessarily to be honest, because again, right now we really going into it, we have no idea what the actual short position might have been. And we have no idea what time frame that the short positions could have been slowly being closed over what duration. So there's a really big difference between shorts closing all at once because of a margin call or because of some sort of broader risk management requirement. It's a completely different scenario than if they're just slowly closing a short position because the idea is now no longer invalid to take the idea off, meaning, you know, thinking game stop, for example, is going to go insolvent.

    "text": "they're just slowly closing a short position because the idea is now no longer invalid to take the idea off, meaning, you know, thinking game stop, for example, is going to go insolvent. So the way to think about that is like this, if we zoom this out, let's do 10 year monthly. If you look across the volume over the past 10 years on a monthly cadence, it's hundreds of millions of shares during low vol periods. This is a low volatility period leading into the squeeze that we saw in 2021. And you're seeing volume still at 200,400,000, 222 million. I'm just giving you an example for that's a lot of volume. So depending on how big the short flow actually was, which honestly, we have no idea. That's another thing. We know it was over shorted beyond the flow. So like we have no idea how big the short position fully was, which could have been fucking insane. But that aside, as you look through stuff like this here, this month during 21 when we had the squeeze, this represented a 5 billion volume. That's a lot of short covering happening right there during this squeeze. And then that same amount of activity does sustain to a pretty significant degree, 3.3 billion, 2.7 billion. This is all short covering as well. That's happening during these. So an important thing to remember is like during the short squeezes themselves, there's going to be short covering.

So an important thing to remember is like during the short squeezes themselves, there's going to be short covering.

That's the problem with trying to hypothesize any of this is like we're just guessing. It's all pure guessing because we genuinely don't know. But I think it would be naive to think that all of the shorts that were originally opened have just sustained and been on and have been carried for essentially the whole duration. That's not to say again that it couldn't happen, but I think it's naive to assume that. The reality is the things have probably moved quite a bit more than that. But how much? We have no idea.

I would absolutely have to validate them. The first thing I can tell you though is we do need to access, used to access. So we can better see the five day performance metrics. So this is an example of a shortfall with ChatGPT. It did exactly what I asked it to do, but it doesn't know something pretty simple. Like in this case, this you can't see pretty much anything. So really what this needs to do here is have two access. The other thing is this access makes literally no sense. Negative 5, 15, it's like completely fucking random. So it needs to also order these not by the date because that's what it's doing, but to order it by the percent move. This otherwise it's kind of confusing. Good. Next. Yeah, this is much better. So I'll show you the revised one. This one looks much better. So what we're looking at now is five day price performance leading into the 20th of April and then coming out of the 20th of April.

So I mean, in general, the performance after is kind of flat. And then the price performance going into it is a little elevated. We can draw some trend lines to more easily visualize this. Draw trend lines for the five day performance lines and the day up. So now I'm just putting some trend lines on it. So it's easier to visualize. Okay. Okay, it's struggling. It doesn't matter that much. The takeaway from this is there's not really like this massive clear trend coming into or coming out of the 428. And this is going back to 2004. There's it's seemingly a slight positive side severity. But not not like a tremendous amount. Cool. So we are pretty much at time. But I didn't have a chance to go through the positions. That's okay.

And this puts us at 79 utilized right now. So the key changes from what you probably will have seen historically really stem from this. There are no current long shares. I am completely out of the actual shares. And I took the most recent bit of shares down for a loss on the 7th of April. So I'll show you. And I'll walk you through what was going on here. So if we take a look at the 7th of April, which is this date, we start to get a little bit of a rally, which is really, really solid. But the basis for those options was 25 75. So it's still underwater. And at this point, those options were originally purchased going back to. Eight know eight know of in 7 Jan, those are kind of like the two time frames where it first started to be built out.

So that doesn't work well for my position in the coverage triangle naturally. Now, as you'll see from what I discussed earlier, one of the benefits of GameStop is the fact that it has really high volatility. That high volatility is really useful problem is if I'm holding long shares, I don't really get to benefit from the volatility that much just in shares. As conditions look right now, I'm not seeing any artifacts or hints that there might be some sort of really large potential for a squeeze coming up. I never know. Nobody ever knows. But there are precursors that have always happened before every single squeeze going back for GameStop's entire history. We can see it clear as day. The first thing is volume. So with volume actually contracting that leads me to believe probably low propensity right now for a squeeze. And for those that might be a little confounded by what I'm saying here, we go back 10 years. Let's zoom this in. And let's go through some of the prior squeezes that we've seen. So nothing in here, I wouldn't really qualify as a squeeze. But this I absolutely still would qualify this up move. And again, I'm going to",

But this I absolutely still would qualify this up move. And again, I'm going to squish the rest of this down because it doesn't matter right now. I want you to just take a look at the volume. So take a look at the volume well before it got anywhere near its peak in here, right in the low 30s. Take a look at the slopes of short term volume five day average and then 20 day volume average. What do you notice? I noticed that the five day is above the 20 and they're both upward sloping. And I noticed that the five days growing rapidly. I noticed that there were pretty significant volume spikes relative to prior history at this point. That led from and again, this isn't like cherry picking the thing that happened the next day. This is stuff that's happening within the first phases of this move. So if you're looking at it here, there's not a ton going on and then all of a sudden volume starts jacking. So then somewhere in here, you might be saying, okay, this looks interesting. This puts you starting to look to enter around the 25 25 75 handle.

Then interesting day. Very high relative to the other days. It looks mute compared to the rest because of scale on scope. But the day preceding this was at 2.7 mil volume here 8.6 mil. So four times effectively the volume. This is on this day. Then the next day it goes from 8.6 to 36.3 on the day.

It's why when I find interest and I'm paying attention to these other theories on how things might be going and you know why things might be what they are on the cycle analysis and stuff like that. There are interesting ideas, but none of them matter to me at all because I already know that I'm going to see what I need to see before it moves, which is volume. So anyways, all the way back to the original premise of this entire soliloquy and it's that volume is low and it's actually contracting in 20s above 5. So all of that is what leads to the current assumption and then thus the current reason to rotate from the equity position that I had into a short put position. So right now I am short essentially a five-lot in a three-lot. All I did was look at the total loss that I was going to take on these options or on the equity side of the trade, which is a thousand seventy bucks and I said okay, what can I do from an options perspective in order to cover this with options? That's exactly what this is. So I'm effectively taking in 1177, which over compensates this loss on the shares and that's it. So I'm going to manage these short puts just like I",

So I'm going to manage these short puts just like I would as a short put component of the coverage strangle. You'll notice that there are no short calls right now. That's actually temporary because my plan here is if slash when we see game stop start to rotate back down to sub 25. That's where I'm interested in starting to accumulate some shares preferably for me below 24. Now that doesn't inherently look super likely right now because what you see here is a confirmed downtrend lower lows lower highs, then you see an attempted move beyond that here that then rolls back down and confirms a second lower low and now it's in the middle of a transition. Either it's going to start posting higher lows to complement this higher relative high compared to this or it's going to roll back over and then start posting new lower lows. I right now I'm planning more so for that second scenario because again going back to the original concept for this whole thing I am a trader. I need to make money.

There was an original purchase for 24 and then follow on purchase for 32 27 and then 22 21 and a half. Because of these different trades I can adjust my basis by dollar cost averaging in and value cost averaging out to the upside. However that's really the only way you can adjust your basis and the bigger your position gets the more money you have to use the dollar cost average in and have any sort of meaningful change in your basis. That's not the case right now. The case right now is the position has a completely mobile basis from the short put side of the equation because right now I'm short the 26s and the 24s. So let's take a look at what that looks like then. So if we go into the trade tab we go to 16 May this is where the position is now the 26s. Those were originally sold for a dollar 57. So those are about unchanged here and then the 24s those were sold for a dollar 41 which these are clearly making decent money not a ton but decent",

So what happens is as I decide as time comes up to adjust the trade what I'll do is I'll start looking at 30 May or whenever the next primary expiration opens up and I'll say where can I take those 26s. So again for example the 26s are trading for the dollar 82. So let's see where I can get a dollar 82 and get a dollar 82 easily here at the 25s. So I can take that trade book a profit slide it down another point the 25s without adding any size. That's a mobile basis. So then if I decide I end up wanting to close that position and then buy the stock because the stock starts moving I can always do that. But what this allows me to do is make money as the stock is doing what I don't want it to do going down and going sideways. You can't make money like that as a stock trader or holding the stock you need it to go up. So this is a way to make money while it's not doing that.

So that's where we're at with the coverage triangle in GameStop. I'll actually probably make a video actually I'll pop off after this and make a video on that since it's been a little while since I did like an actual like thorough update video on GameStop. I hope what I'm explaining here at least makes sense you'll probably get most of this but I'll show you some of the math behind what I'm doing and why. But yeah that's what I got this what I got for this. Any questions on any of that any stuff that we should take a look at before we wrap up. H says let's try to get one person to sub to break 30k that would be sick. 30k is like it's not really that big right from a trading lens but it's just absolutely fucking crazy to me that there are that many people interested in options and it's a massive it's a massive motivator for me to continue trying to innovate and to try to appeal to a broader and broader group to try to bring this world that literally changed my life to other people. So it's really fun in that way. Never would have expected even to be anywhere near any of",

So it's really fun in that way. Never would have expected even to be anywhere near any of this and again let's all be honest it's not really like any of this is that significant but it still is interesting for me in my lens because I'm not a social media person. I literally started all of this stuff in order to do this. I didn't have like a presence before kind of funny but awesome gang well it looks like we're all caught up. Tomorrow we have the outlier pro trading prep for the week ahead. I have to put on a bunch of stuff. So the goal for tomorrow will be scanning the markets so that I can get a good sense of some opportunities to put on because right now the portfolio is absolutely underutilized compared to what I would like it to be at the moment. So that's the plan for tomorrow and then for the rest of next week. We are back on to standard stream cadence so that means there will be YouTube live streams on Monday and Friday Wednesdays kind of ad hoc. I'm not committing to it but it'll either be like a market update video or a stream. That's the idea for Wednesday and then for Friday we are",

I'm not committing to it but it'll either be like a market update video or a stream. That's the idea for Wednesday and then for Friday we are starting a new segment which is a little mini series about outlier options trading foundations. So the goal for the Friday segment for those that don't know the Friday stream is really geared towards beginners. It's a super beginner friendly environment. We spend time going into the most basic of things to give people a healthy space to learn about options to not worry about getting ribbed for asking questions or feeling weird about any of that stuff. But the whole premise behind the foundation series is I want to try and provide a good bedrock for people to lean on as they start learning about options because they're complex. But before you even think about learning to touch your first option, there's actually a lot of housekeeping that needs to be done in order for anything you do in options trading to be even remotely worthwhile. So that's the idea behind that series that'll be for probably the next four Fridays is the plan. So that's what's coming up. If you have any questions you can always hit me up, be an outlier. See you guys later.",
