So as some of you probably know by now, I am running a coverage strangle in a couple different tickers that I'm sharing with you all and kind of updating as we go through one. It's to show the management of the coverage strangle and different ways we can apply it. And then seconds of vector to learn about the markets together position management, that kind of stuff. So you guessed it, we have two on the agenda. The first one is GameStop and then we have Ibit or Bitcoin. And these are two positions that I've maintained for a little while now, but it's about time to kick this off so that hopefully we can run this for like a full year and just see how they do. So in GameStop, what happened today? We landed just above 32. This was a pretty solid close realistically because the GameStop down 1.97 but the broader market was also having a pretty rough day. You can see that's NASDAQ down heavy and if you take a look at small caps, take a look, fell out of bed. This is not good. So this is small caps really rejecting this consolidation range. And as you can see, there's nothing but below this. This is look out below. There's just not a whole lot of transactions going on in here. So what that tells me is",

There's just not a whole lot of transactions going on in here. So what that tells me is that the movement that we saw in GameStop was actually relatively strong. I think that's generally worthwhile noting the other thing that I want to follow up on was a conversation between Dave, Lauer and I from this past week. We did a live stream on Irvin and we talked about this a little bit. Neither here. I knew exactly what was going on. But this looks like we kind of know what was going on. This is from a little while ago on the 12th of December, but this person is showing some trades on the Chicago exchange. And their assumption is that they're using it to hedge some options that traded very close approximately, which makes a lot of sense. So it looks like a few different contributing factors relating to the volume that we're seeing on Chicago. A lot of it does probably have to do with the rebates that we're seeing liquidity availability. But then you can also see here you go that there are different kinds of benefits that are provided on the Chicago Stock Exchange compared to the other. So really interesting, but it looks like internal market incentives for people to operate there.",

So that part of side, let's take a quick look just at the option chain and then I'll run through the position itself. This is I think mostly going to be representative of what the position sits now. Again, this is through my pass through IRA accounts. What doesn't flash a bunch of personal information. So I just recreate the position down here so that we can look at that together. But we'll get to that in a second. First, let's take a look at the options chain itself. So this is actually interesting. So 957,000 calls against 296,000 puts. That's a massive expansion. And still the majority of that is in 17 Jan 17 Jan is about to be spicy. And you can see that in the fall in 17 Jan still being so elevated. This is just so much exposure there right now. There's no way for it not to be spicy as it sits now. So this is actually very cool to see. I think that this is interesting. Now a bunch of these options will have fell off after today. The 10th,",

So still, I mean in excess of three to one calls to put so still just massive bullish skew. This kind of positioning as far as I see it right now is not just purely people playing these front run expectations of a squeeze right. That's why the 10 Jan is so light. That's why the 17 Jan is so heavy. We got to 21 Feb. It's super light 21 March super light. So we're still playing the near game for sure. But yeah, we haven't really started filling out any of these deeper except 16 Jan 26 is ready at 57,000. It's about a one to one ratio between calls and puts. So the short term is capturing all of that bullish skew. But as you know, shout out to the out of the monies for today. We lost a lot of good soldiers out there. You just hate to see it happen.

So if we take a look. I did have the 7 Jan 25s. I had the 32s. And these were set to come down today. The objective was to be assigned. I sold these when they were 44 delta. So they were right at the money. But alas, no such luck. So Easy day here. These essentially will be moved down to my put tracking side down here. I got to make sure that the same format applies to this whole thing so that Erick's OCD doesn't go insane. And this will come off from here. And then we will look to reenter some more. So now after today as the position sets. It looks like we will be a little bit like like I was expecting to be up a little bit more shares here. We're only on 300 shares at 2695. I still don't want to scale on a whole bunch here. But it's starting to force the hand a little bit.

And I think we should be deeper than that. On GameStop for the allocation. And for those that don't know I did up the allocation to 25k just because we did a couple polls on the weekend streams and that seems to be about representative for about the average account size as far as I can tell. So there's nothing going on here. You just ignore all that. So yeah, we have 300 shares 2695. We have two of the 28 puts out in 21 Feb. These will sit. Those were 52 DTE were only 10 days in that trade. And then we have only one of the 35 calls. I probably will sell a second soon. And that will likely happen on Monday. That's just to capture some more of this volatility, especially as we're coming into this near term expiration. So the additional calls that I will sell will be it wouldn't be two.

    "text": "again for me. And like my primary Bitcoin position is actually just in Bitcoin itself. So this is all part of that broader tester portfolio. This is actually using my money, but I just break a piece of it off to do these with you. Because even though there's a little bit that suboptimal about doing some of these the way that I am. It's not exactly how I'm playing these outright. I still feel comfortable with the positions that I'm fine with them. Right. I like I wouldn't just waste good money. It's just not exactly optimized. I would be trading a little more aggressively than this. But the coverage triangle as I'll continue to remind you is really designed to be built around a buy and hold position. So what I'm essentially doing here is saying I want to buy and hold something like I bit you pro T triple cues and then GameStop and then I'm trading this around it. So right now we have a thousand shares at 54 55 and we have five series five total short puts out two different tranches. We have a two lot and a three lot. So super small trades. We're in the 52 strike in 17 Jan and then the 49 strike in 21 feb. And then on the call side, we have six of the 60s expiring 21 feb. You can see that we have six or 600 total short delta potential on this side against 1000 long",

You can see that we have six or 600 total short delta potential on this side against 1000 long delta. So we're still maintaining that ratio. And this one is a lot of just sit and wait for now. There's not a whole lot going on that's super exciting. There were a couple management components a little earlier. And let's take a look. We have I bit is hanging out right now at 53 84. This is basing a little bit better. But it is at a very delicate spot still. And the reason why I say that is because you can see that it's transacting against this point of control that it's been establishing for some time now. The market's been hovering around up here. But I'm seeing lower highs, which is not good. It is better at least that it's holding these lows and those are pretty flat. But beyond that, it doesn't look super healthy. This is completely stuck there for the time being. It's our new friend. So really what we want to see is I've it's starting to crack above this for kind of like a bullish continuation. That's the reason why I added some shares here. But in terms of overall allocation. What did I have 125K allocated in the position right now",

But in terms of overall allocation. What did I have 125K allocated in the position right now is only using 80. So we're still less than 65 allocated. And it's to give me room to move right like if we fall 30 40 I want to be able to scale into that. And if we start breaking out, I still have room to scale in and catch more of the upside. My my broad expectation of the market right now is it feels like it is in a delicate state. It does not look super healthy. We're seeing some small elements of strength. But one thing I have been really, really pleased with the Bitcoin holding is that it does a good job to a degree offsetting some of the risk that I have an IWM Q's and Spiders. Though beta relationship there. It's not decoupled at all. But it is lighter, which is again, just generally kind of cool because it's a way to be long something that I like. I don't necessarily want Bitcoin to go down at all so that the underlines like you per on TQs can do well. And they maintain a relationship where they're a little less correlated that allows me to do that. That's where we're at. So there's anything",

So there's anything you'd like to see me talk about anything you want me to go over in these recap videos. Let me know we'll be doing these pretty regularly. For the rest of the year, ideally, because again, I want to give you a long run view of what we're doing in these two strategies. So hopefully people can learn a different way of doing things. Hopefully, Adam, a couple more tools to the tool belt. And there will be some weeks where there's not going to be a whole lot to talk about because a lot of the strategy is by holding and waiting. But that's still part of the game. So I hope to show you some of the interesting points where we're going to have to roll in the money options. That's absolutely going to be on the on the docket right now. It is. But there will be periods where this is going to become pretty hectic, especially if the market rolls over. But if not, it's a lot of this. So let me know if there's anything you want to see me talk about. Be an outlier. Let's see all later.",
