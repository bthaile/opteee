We have a pretty cool session, hopefully, in store for today. I have a few things on the agenda, but I'm also hoping to pick your brain as kind of the chat in the audience. So that we can figure out other things that we want to go explore together, but I figured there's a few things on the top of my mind. The first thing is the 8K that was filed. I want to take a look at that. And I also want to run through kind of these different studies that I've been looking through. This is how I learn a lot about markets in general is I'll refer to like existing published studies that I can dive into their research, understand how they're looking at things. So we have a couple things on the docket. Some of these I've already read. Some of them I haven't and I'll make it super easy for us. We don't have to go through like these entire things. What I'll do is summarize some of what I learned from it up front, flip through some of the interesting spots with you. And then I can always throw it into chat GPT if you have any specific questions that we want to dive into. But this is a lot of bedrock behind like what makes GameStop",

I say it all the time, but like it continues to shock me as an anomaly. There's so many things about the stock that buck normal trends and as a lifelong trader, I cannot help but find stuff like that just truly, truly fascinating. There's so many things about it that every time I think I'm generally understanding or that this that or the other piece kind of finally line up and I'll find something new. And the other thing about GameStop that I enjoy a lot is it's teaching me a lot about market structure that again, even from a pretty longstanding trader standpoint, a practitioner standpoint, I didn't know all these different details because it's never really impacted the majority of what I was doing as a trader. So this thing is just so cool to me and I love these sessions and kind of working through learning more about it from two different perspectives, from the general interest perspective for GameStop, the story, the community, that stuff in it itself is always a blast.

So I am happy as you could tell to be here with you all and to start getting into detail. So I figure we can start with a quick recap about GameStop, kind of just what it's done since the last week we've spoke. Then I thought we can take a look at any pertinent GameStop news that's popped up. Obviously some of them have already been covered ad nauseam throughout the week and our boy Newton. I was just texting with him. He has a bunch of research that he's doing now regarding slightly different effects. And so I thought we could do a quick recap just on some general news. And then I can talk to you about some of the research that I'm doing. And then yeah, whatever else you think would be fun to take a look at.

The Clifnotes version is, well, the disclaimer, I should say upfront, is that I upfront do not have a good foundation for it yet. I've started looking through it kind of in a cursory manner to get familiar with it to understand it a little bit better, but I'm not, like it's not jumping out at me yet.

I know people will say, because I've had people say it to me before like, oh yes, this person has been kind of spot on all the time or whatever the case is. And the fact of the matter is is I've already regressed most of the common trading tools that most traders use. And it does not corroborate that. So the thing with something like GameStop that I've learned is that it does have elements that will follow what we would consider to be more standard technical analysis components that is unequivocally true. But what I find specifically with GameStop is that those will exist until they don't exist. And that to me is kind of worth things get interesting because it's not as simple as just apply technical analysis because there isn't really a bucket of technical analysis that would indicate a lot of what we see GameStop doing until again, it does whatever it does. So I just bring that as a general point because I think it's worth at least identifying. I will continue to conduct technical analysis on GameStop because I think that it's logical and I think that it makes sense to at least consider it. And it will, in my opinion, follow that rule set to a degree, but it will follow the rule set until it doesn't, which makes something like technical analysis really tricky to work with.",

So just a general admin note. Now one of the things that I we researched this a bit last time and I think it's worth reiterating, honestly, as many times as we possibly can, one of the things that I have found continually with GameStop is specifically volume is involved in every move. I know what a revelation, right? Like the sky is blue. Got it. Yeah, we all know that. But I don't think we pay enough respect with respect to GameStop because we spend a lot of time exploring all these other different kinds of potential signals as we should, one because they're interesting too, because there could be a pretty strong signal there. But that aside, I think it's kind of important to expand a little bit beyond that and to try to figure out like tradable signals, right? And every time I see any sort of movement in GameStop, there's an expansion in volume that precedes the move, right? I think it was in the last stream that I was talking about in expansion and volume around here. And they're like, yeah, great dude, you just identified that volume expanded on the day stuff was going",

    "text": "movement in GameStop, there's an expansion in volume that precedes the move, right? I think it was in the last stream that I was talking about in expansion and volume around here. And they're like, yeah, great dude, you just identified that volume expanded on the day stuff was going on. But then what I try to highlight to people in that conversation was actually if you look back even before this move, volume started to expand bigger than its average even before this move. So no, it's not this volume. Obviously, it's not going to be crazy off the Richter scale, but there are still signs. And what I want you to do is take a look at the volume around these different peaks that we see at different points in time and then take a look at the volume here, most recently. This is an crazy big volume, but this volume here is not all too dissimilar to the volume that we saw here. Now this volume ended up leading into this trowel. So again, just because there's volume doesn't mean it's going up. We don't know exactly what it means. But you'll also notice almost always the volume is going to be wrapped around an earnings event in some capacity. This is common for equities. Again, there's always exceptions to the rule. I don't see some sort of mass of volume spike around this one, but I see it here, here, I see it here still, I",

I don't see some sort of mass of volume spike around this one, but I see it here, here, I see it here still, I see it here, and I see it here. So volume around earnings is going to be something that's part of this puzzle, and it honestly confounds the puzzle a little bit. Because then you kind of have to assess like, okay, well, is it this kind of volume where we had this volume before earnings last time? And then after earnings, it started to take Peter off. Like, it could be that I don't know yet. But what I do know is this volume here is massive compared to the recent volume. And again, it's all contextual because when we look at these volume spikes, we might again, look at this and be like, oh, shit, well, it's only 15 million. And if you look at this over here, it was 279 million. That's not the point. We're missing the point there. What I'm talking about, oh, sorry, what I'm talking about is a relative volume. So if we look in this period before this jump up here, the volume on average was like two and a half million to five million on a five day to 20 day period. It was much lower.

So it's when we're analyzing anything, but specifically volume in something like this, we have to pay attention to the conditions around it and not just grossly compare it to this because we know what's going on here. This is in the middle of a fucking squeeze where people are trying to avoid getting their heads ripped off. So they're going and buying everything that they can. And this is before we had the at the market. So there is a ton, a ton of different conditions going on. So the thing I cautioned, and this is exactly why you'll notice on my charts, I have these volume averages because it helps me contextualize what I'm looking at. So if you look in this space right here, I don't know how clear it is, I'll read it out to you. But if I go back to the 27th of August, I'm just kind of picking a day here.

If we go to the 29th, volume is now 10 million, 10 million, raw volume right out of the gate over doubled on this day. And the five day average now moves up to down actually to 5.4 million. And the five day average now moves up because of this to 5.7 million. So this is still double the previous volume on a raw basis. And it's double the averages. And we have another day of really high volume, the 30th volume now expands to 15.7 million shares. The 20 day average had moved up to 5.7 because of the previous day. And then the five day average, which is going to be more sensitive to recent volume is all the way up to eight. It's still essentially double that. So this kind of scaling volume is fascinating to me. Now the other thing that again, I approach markets in this, based on my background, right? Like my undergrad and graduate degree are based around statistics. It's the way I look at the world. And when I look at these things, I'm like, okay, cool. I'm seeing volume starting to grow interesting. And I got alerts on",

So now, I'm like, okay, volume essentially has gone from 5 million to 15 over a two day period. And earnings is still not yet. So what I like to do then is say, okay, let's take a look at a historic standpoint where volume tripled into earnings and how close was it into earnings. And if we go back to this, I'm hovering so that you can see if you follow this over here, which just shows the volume for today, I want you to see something volume here, which was the 26th of March on earnings was 17 million. Now if I go back one to two days, volume drops to 4 million. And then if I keep going back, I see 3.9, 3.8, 3.4, 4.4, 2.8, 2.3, 2.1, 3.1, 2.1, 3.8, 3.1, 4.3.

Volume did not expand. Here we are still a week out from earnings in volume is expanding. That's not what happened here. What happened in this case is earnings was on the 26th. I can identify volume growing on the 25th. But as soon as you go outside of the 25th to the 22nd and previous volume has not tripled the same way that we're seeing here. So that's why I say this volume expansion reminds me far more of what I see here than what I see here. Because here I can clearly identify volume is expanding for earnings. There is day. It's the day before earnings. It's the day of earnings. It's the day after earnings. And then it slowly tailors back down. Very normal earnings volume cycle. That's not the case for this. Because we're still ways out from earnings, which is on the 10th. That's still. It's not even next week. It's the following week. So we have a ways to go again, temporally, not super far. But for this volume to triple, I find that very, very interesting. So what I want to do actually with you all is I want to do a little bit of a study. I haven't done it yet.

I haven't done it yet. I can do it now as we're talking. And what I'm going to do is again, I'm going to go to bar chart because I have an account with them. I'm going to go to the story data here. And I'm going to grab daily game stop data. Again, going back to 2000. And again, I know I don't think game stop even goes back that far. But I just use the default date window that's generally all encompassing. The reason why I'm re-downloading this data is so that it's essentially raw. So I have that now and we can take a look at a few things. I'm going to add a filter here and now we can take a look through together. Let me squish this down. And also I need to correct myself because last time I did this with chat GPT and somebody noted in the comments that what I talked about in the live stream was wrong. And I looked back at it and it was, it was completely wrong. So I ran it through chat GPT and I was talking to you guys about it on the last live stream about volume expansion and it was not accurate. I have to call myself out",

But it was still wrong. So I have to correct that. And then also I have to take some drugs now because the old sciatica is still going. Rock on for that. And the drink of choice is, as you already know, mango orange spin drift. That's the way to do it. So yeah, let's take a look here. What I want to do is simply look at a day over day change in volume day over day, day over day volume delta. And then I'm literally just going to figure out as a percentage. So this minus this divided by this will turn this into a percent. I got a wideness out a little bit so I can see my tools easier. We want a percent. And I typically like two decimals and then we'll drag that all the way down. And then I'm going to filter this again. I have to widen this out so that all my ship pops up. Okay. Data will add",

And we'll do greater than 50 and then we will do negative 50. So now what I'm doing is just seeing how frequently this happens again and this is going back to the origin of GameStop. So there's 1391 instances. So it's too much for us to reasonably look through again on the livestream so I don't want to waste a bunch of your time. So shout out to the apes. There's over a hundred of us hanging out right now learning about GameStop. So shout out to you guys.

Actually, I'm curious for those that are in the chat now, where are you from? That's typically that's kind of like a fun exercise because I found in a few instances where people are from way different places than I would have expected. We got Michigan, California. Hey, I'm in California. Ohio, Jersey, the city, PEI, I don't know PEI. Indiana, North Carolina, Pacific Northwest. Is that like Seattle? Kentucky, the city. I have a buddy that lives in Long Island City for B Williams. Pennsylvania, my uncle, he lives by Matt Amores, Pennsylvania. We got Belgium. Utah. Hey, we were looking, Roy and Clity, what up? Utah. We were not, we were looking at Utah. Rubin from Norway. I was literally, literally just in Norway. That was my last trip. Korea, Vegas. Like this is the cool part, man.

I don't like living in cities personally. It was going to be like in the suburbs on the outside. If that's where we do end up. But yeah, Sean's in Florida. That's super cool.

So right now leaning towards Colorado Springs, I think. Vladimir says Reno, yeah, yeah, Reno, Nevada. Willie says what made you reconsider California? It's just because there's a lot of things about the state that don't resonate with me. I have, I really like cars and I have like a built Corvette C7 that is, I have to play all these different games because they have really strict regulations on what you can do to your cars.

I like shooting a lot. It like obviously from my background, but even from growing up. It's like difficult to go shooting here. So one of my plans is wherever I move, I'm going to buy a little bit of property that I can set up a shooting range. It's just all those little kind of things like that. So yeah, it's, it's a little bit of a break. So funny part is is like most people think that San Diego has like the nicest weather on earth and it has beautiful weather. But the funny part is is like if you'll notice the places I tend to go on vacation, like the last trip was to Norway, the trip to before that was to Iceland. Like I'm not going for, I don't really care for the weather. I don't like it. It's on a sun. I don't mind the sun obviously, but I don't like it hot. I am very much Nordic in descent. So yeah, it's not, not my vibe. Vladimir says in, in the Vodans, that of speeding tickets, they give you an access of use of fuel citation. That's hilarious.

Yeah, because those two are pretty close together from what I've seen. I've been to Denver. I haven't spent much time around Colorado Springs yet. We're actually going to do like a remote week there sometime to get a vibe check and see if we like it. So yeah, the cool part and the point of this exercise, if you take a look through this, like we have people literally from all over. Gregor says, where's Newton? I think he's chilling with his fam right now. Yeah. So Newton is, he and I have been talking, I'm not sure when we'll be able to line up on a live stream together. It's still something that we both are interested in, but he's kicking off a new schedule with work and stuff and it's just a lot for him because he still wants to do his daily videos.

I'm fortunate that I have a pretty flexible schedule, but I totally respect that he's got a lot going on. So yeah, he and I still talk were obviously sharing ideas and kind of exploring things together.

I had him on my podcast and it's nothing I do. So I can't speak intelligently to it is to like whether or not it's efficacious or not I could see it being useful for some people, but it's definitely not. It's not for me is the way I would look at. Okay, so what I want to do now is actually create a little bit of a distribution here. So I'll do like count of percent ranges. And then I'm going to do count if we'll count these. And what do we want to do? Do we want to do it like? Let's do like greater than 100 to start. Let's see if this works. Oops. My bad. So 455. And then let's do. So that's actually interesting. So there's way more. I mean, I honestly think we can just filter this then by 100 get rid of the so we'll do one or less than one.

The 29th of November. Yeah, big pop. Which is interesting because this one looks like a bit of a standalone if I'm not mistaken. Tanner says 2023 had October, volume November, volume March, volume, but besides that nothing. Yeah, which is fascinating, right? Because I can see this September volume that's starting to kick off, but it does. I can't tell what it's from. I'm going to fast forward to December just so I can see the period around it. Oh, earnings. There it is. So this had earnings on the sixth and volume started to expand on the 28th. So still this is not an example of what we're seeing right now, which is really interesting.

So as I'm kind of just, you know, quickly glossing over this, there's what I'm doing right now has zero statistical efficacy or rigor. I'm just kind of spot checking a couple random things real fast. Just because like for me to actually do this process, it takes a while and I have some of it done in Tableau already, but I haven't finished overlaying some of the other data points that I'm really interested in. It's like the FTD cycles or things like not FTDs. What else am I swaps? That's it. Sorry. Had a bit of a brain sees there or the swaps. So it's just not done yet. But so what I'm looking at though are different periods were volume essentially is expanded meaningfully over the previous day. And I'm looking for periods where it is at least greater than 100. And what I'm able to identify by this are other instances where we're seeing at least somewhat similar price movement to what we're seeing now and what it's predicated on. So if I take a look at another period, I can bring this back over so you can see what I'm doing. So I'm just picking random periods. So like this one here, I want to see if this is where earnings was. So instead of going in on demand yet, I'm going to",

All of the other earnings markers there we go. Okay. So we have seven June like these definitely this is definitely something. I see, I mean, that's just interesting. Look at this. Just from a volume perspective, seven June, seven July, eight August. That's a really tight range over a three day period or three month period consistently with really high volumes. So this tells me this isn't earnings, right? Because earnings doesn't happen that many times in such a consolidated period. So these periods here are now just interesting to me. I want to know what is going on here. So we'll go back. Let's start with eight, eight, 22. And the whole idea behind this just so that you understand why I'm doing this, the whole goal here is again, this is me fingerprinting.

And then we know for the previous three months that there is pretty significant movements. And again, this starts to make more sense now. So when I look at the split, this is normal. This would typically spur some sort of movement. This right here looks completely random to me. So from the sixth, volume was at 9.9. And then on the seventh, it goes to 30. Why? I don't understand why that happened there. That seems random to me. The movement that I see in May is way more logical because I can see that that's tied to earnings. Ruben says the Ranger describing with volume is something new and others have gone into your correct to tie it to earnings. Yeah, so but the maybe you can help me out here, Ruben. Vladimir off Putin says can't read the dates. So right now I'm looking at 2022. So right now the chart is set to be August, eighth, 2022.

The fact that that is such a regimented cadence for volume to happen to expand month over a month around the same exact time frame. So for example, when I'm looking at this, this is where I start thinking something about swaps. However, the problem with the swaps at least so far from what I've researched in GameStop is what I try to tell people is when I'm looking at things from a statistical standpoint, I'm not trying to look for what I'm looking for. I'm simply trying to analyze and see what comes up. So what that means is when I grabbed the swap data that I could for GameStop, which took me back into 2022, rather than trying to see what count period aligns with stock movements and swap explorations, it was essentially inconclusive. There's some levels of correlation in some instances, but it doesn't pass any T-test. There's no confidence interval I can assign to it and say like, yeah, this is reasonably presumative or a reasonable signal for some sort of stock movement because you also can't even fully isolate it.

Again, this move back in May or on the 1st of June, I can attribute the preemptive move here to earnings. Volume started expanding on the 25th. Earnings was what, five, six days later? Like that's fine. That's super, super normal. And expecting a big movement in the underlying leading into earnings is completely normal. Now what's not normal are these movements. And I can't quite put my finger onto why these movements are occurring. Tanner says. Eric, go scroll up. I have exact dates for you to check out. Check out the volume spikes on those dates. Sure.

    "text": "the 24th? Because the 24th saw a big volume spike. The 24th volume spike, almost a thousand percent. So a big spike. Yeah. So let's significant about the 24th in your opinion. Let's go there. Let's go this. I'm looking at 21 right? Yeah, let's go to 21. And then let's go to February 20th. I'm going to go a little bit past it so that we can kind of see how it flows. Yeah, I mean, this is a squeeze to me. Like that's that's exactly what this is here in my opinion. So if I were looking at this and trying to identify the reason behind this kickoff and price movement. This is a squeeze. Yeah, that's exactly what I see here for whatever reason, but that's what I see here. And again, like I try to identify for you all, one of the really cool things about this and the use of volume is take a look. Look at the volume here. The volume front runs the entire squeeze. You can see it run up here. It contracts. And I also notice this is pretty common for the larger moves and game stop at least from what I've seen so far is it looks like there's typically these two spikes. Most of them I see this pattern where there's a spike. It calms down and then typically within like two weeks, three weeks, it starts another spike that then will typically calm back down, which I can't",

That's so funny. Vladimir off Putin says remember that D.F.V. was still posting in February 2021. Let's think about that would be also very interesting to see what kind of positions he had on around this point. I have his page linked on my to do list. Here we go. And then I can expand this. So let's take a look. January February. So this is interesting. Oh, that's funny. So he used to post in Wall Street bets. 22 47. Three, two, three, one, one. So what I'm doing now is I'm just getting a sense of these different posts. And to see because like you can see that he was hovering right around that one, one to three mill mark for a long time, right? 973, one. Anyways, going back up here. We need to be in here. Web 19th, Web 3rd, Web 2nd. So this started like the end of Jan. Did he have anything there? He did. Jan 28th. So let's see how far back he goes here. 25th, 22 19th. So the move really started on the 13th. Let's see how far back he goes. The 11th.",

Which again, it's just important for me to know that because it helps frame the rest of my research knowing that to be generally the case because that is generally the case here. Like if he had some sort of, you know, if he had to hit some sort of like near perfect methodology for entering an exiting, it would tell me a lot about the kind of triggers or signals that he was using. So when I look at this though, I can see that he started entering even all the way back on like mid December. And if we go into December, there just isn't a whole lot going on here. Price is moving, but it's not moving a ton. So what this tells me is that obviously he has his pulse on something. He has the pulse of something. I don't know what that he clearly is looking at because there is some sort of move that happens generally to poorly to where he's operating. But it's not like this perfect timing thing.

Because if we look at all the different research that we're running right now, we're trying to identify essentially to this specific day that something should or should not happen. And as I'm looking at this, I actually am starting to change my opinion that rather than looking at a specific day that we think something should or should not happen, that we should be looking at specific windows.

I know earnings has certain behaviors as an options trader that I can take advantage of. Starting two weeks out, implied volatility is going to start expanding into earnings. I know this. Then I also know, after earnings, volatility is going to contract to a degree. So understanding that volatility is going to contract through earnings, if earnings is on the 15th of the month, I'm not going to put the position on the 15th of the previous month for the earnings effect on the 15th of the following month. It doesn't make sense to me. Now, conversely, if I'm looking at the run up into earnings that two week period, that's not a perfect window. And it actually varies quite a bit. So I might put that trade on 20 days early. I might put it on 10 days early. I might put it on 14 days early leading into earnings. It's more of a window. So part of me thinks that while we're conducting a lot of this research, trying to pinpoint like specific days, I actually think we might want to start looking at it in terms of windows.

Because again, like I can see from this positioning in this time frame, whether or not that's exactly what he was looking at that was going to cause this. I obviously don't know. But it tells me that this isn't some hyper pinpoint accuracy system. This is something that's kind of based on more of a window that I find really, really interesting. So I find I find that curious and I find a lot of the work we're doing to be interesting. But it tells me that I think we should probably start looking more so at an X period window, whether it's a five day window, 10 day window. I'm not sure yet. I have to do a little bit of digging on that. But we've been spending so much time trying to pinpoint, okay, the swaps are coming do or the FTDs are coming do on this day. So then tomorrow we should see a big move. And it just typically doesn't pan out that way. If we can start thinking of it more so as based on these effects that are going on, it's likely to impact the market during some period, some 10 day window. To me, that makes a lot of sense.

And it probably leads most of us astray from a pretty, from a, like a pretty tradable window, I think.

So the other thing I look at is like this looks generally around when he's, you know, still staying active, the fifth, the 11th, the 13th, right? So he's just kind of updating. Yeah. Updating updating updating semi-regular cadence. 20th, Bab, right? So like this is all persistent exposure if you think about it. So just about all of this. All of this that I see here, it looks like just standard. He's maintaining exposure of some sort. Yeah, because he has like the April 18th, 10 call the April 18th. So what was going on in April 18th of 21? Was that earnings? Let's fast forward this. I'll just go to the NMA. No, not earnings. April 18th. So standard options expiration for April. I don't know why. I don't know why we pick that 16 April. Why do we pick that? When do we add those? Oh, shit, he added those a while ago. They're all the way back here. January, they're all the way back here in 2020. Okay, so this is just a persistent leverage position. That's what this tells me.",

Okay, so this is just a persistent leverage position. That's what this tells me. So he's adding these, these longer dated calls here, right? Because these are for April and he put them back on in 2020. Let's see how far back we go. Yeah, man, that's annoying. I'm just going to start from here. Yeah, they were already on here. So in this case, all the way back in September. And again, this, this to me aligns with more of the first of the last two days. And I think that's what I think is the most important thing is that most of the positions I've seen him put on as I go through his posts. Look like they're further out in time, not always super far, but not like two days. Most of them are like a month of at least a few weeks, a month, a way over a month. In this case. So in this scenario, when I see that he's put on these April calls all the way back at least in September. And he's just a leveraged position, right?

I think you guys explain to me that the community, I think it was super stonk or one of the that was like really skeptical of options, right? Is that accurate? Because I think you guys, I think you guys were telling me that like nobody wanted to hear anything about options that are that like there was some sort of problem. If you talked about options, but. Okay, so yeah, it was super stonk got it. And I find this really interesting because. Obviously he literally has the bulk of his money in options. This is quite literally how he created wealth like straight up. So because you can see the total value of the portfolio here for the shares is 86,000.

No precise target just up. Yep, that makes sense. Yeah. So. One of the most interesting things about this that the more I look at it the more I identify is that. He is just so willing to take these hyper concentrated risk positions. Which is crazy. Yeah, it's mostly options, man. Even back when he had low baby account. That's interesting. So he really did use options to essentially just as leverage alongside that's super interesting. Cetric says lots of people got burned over the years super strong said no more options. Yeah, that's a bummer because you can kind of tell like as I was looking through this that that's the bulk of what he did. I didn't know that I literally would not have guessed that based on what. Again, the way that the community has kind of taught me so far. I wouldn't have guessed that the bulk of this is done through options.

So this highlights exactly what I kind of expected right is that this he he likes to be super concentrated. But in my opinion, such actions may have also reduced my estimated return. So the dude is like laser focused on a thesis he believes in. And it's like balls to the wall to the return. It's not like not really caring about the risk. Like this right like to make more money. He's keeping that super super simple. Oh, hell yeah, here we go. Well, where was that I'm jacked to the tits. That's what I'm talking about. We need some need some leverage here.

Yeah, so just to be clear, that's not brokers that is market makers that would be doing that. And yeah, that's definitely part of it, especially if it's a much lower float stock. It will certainly display those kind of behaviors. So yeah, I think, I think that's definitely part of the movement that you saw. And I also think that's part of the the reason why we tend to see this moving the way it's moving now is because of the at-the-market. The way that the shares are going to behave in this kind of scenario is going to be slightly different. Let me see. Chris says no GMME guys are playing Siri just FYI.

And because the other thing that I think you guys have taught me is that there's overlap between the GMME community and the AMC community, but they're not like the same. And there's a schism between them. I find that really, really interesting. The Vladimir off Putin name is so funny. Vladimir off Putin says meme traders are super tribal. Yeah, that makes sense. All right. Willie says, how do you guys explain the music emojis on our case post them? Dogs, Doc, turn out to be validated. I'm actually really curious to be honest. Like I, I love looking at the emojis and kind of hearing the different theories on it, but my opinion is that people are, I think people are reading into them way further than intended.

I think he knows that when he posts stuff like that, it's going to send people into, you know, in a bis of research and theories and stuff like that. And I don't know, maybe he just enjoys that as like a general game to see maybe who gets it. But yeah, I find, I do find that part kind of interesting, because when I look at the general flow of what he's sharing and stuff, like I do feel like people read into them a little bit further than he was intending. And the reason why I think that is because this exact thing, I keep sharing the clip because I think it's important. But there is the clip from Cohen when he was on that podcast. And he was, I'll just share it again, because it's it's worthwhile enough, I think. But a lot of you will probably already know what I'm talking about. Oh, and podcast. I keep forgetting I can't do Cohen. I have to do here. Okay. And then I will share the audio. And then I have to find the spot. Yeah, here. All right. And then just listen for a second.

But like there's no real reason in my opinion to go through this and read all of these different things if you're familiar with them already or if it's not something that fits into your book. That's the way I would think about it. So for example, like put spreads. You can read through what they are so that you understand what they are. But then if it's something that you're not going to trade, then I wouldn't read through the entire thing about put spreads. Again, unless you're you're generally interested in it.

So there's stuff in here from a structural perspective that I think is really important. And then there's a lot of stuff in here that's good general reference that you probably don't have to read all the way through. So I decided he was ready to stop out of the office for a second. All right. So back to the other question about Berkshire involvement. Let me see. That was from Willie. So let me see what Willie followed up with. Okay. Willie says people have noticed Berk A. Volume being strange. I'm not sure that that means anything in my opinion. If that's if that's the link like I wouldn't wait that very heavily. Chuck of the North says go to Berk A daily in zoom out volume dies the day GME ripped. Let's take a look. So let's take a look at Berk A. Let's do a side by side. This would be easier. So we'll do GME up top and then we'll do Berk A. And let's compare these together. So I don't see that. So Cedric you're saying that volume dies on the day that",

So it follows it through this move, right? Falls it through this move to the sixth. These are lined up. Volume is still high. And then volume starts to tailor off after this. So to me, this is something else that's going on in here personally. Because if I look at these on a longer term time frame, I can see this giant ebb and flow of volume that then just cuts. I'm not sure what led to this cut in volume, but it doesn't look like it's, it doesn't at least to me. It doesn't look like it's highly correlated to GME at least volume behavior.

I don't know, again, whether or not the cat is there, that I have no idea, I have no opinion on whatsoever. But what I do know is that is absolutely why Berkshire is there. For sure. And these kinds of plays, again, like merger arbitrage is not a standard form of arbitrage, which I feel like is really important for people to always keep in the back in their mind. When we're looking at something like merger, because merger, Arb still has a lot of carry risk. Like this deal with this will not deal.

But this specific scenario is a little bit different because it's kind of like a merger, but kind of not, right? Like it's just kind of like a reorganization almost I would call it. So, Cedric says it's not arbitrage, the deal can fail. No, I don't think the deal really can fail because it's an internal reorganization. Like Siri is already held by Liberty Media. They just have different series of stocks that they're looking to consolidate, instead of having different series of stocks. Now, the thing is there's a variance between the perceived value that's tracked from Liberty Media that's tracked within Siri. So that's where the arbitrage merger arbitrage opportunity comes from is the reconciliation of those two values if this reorganization goes through. So to your point, and I would agree with it 100, there's always risks associated with these kinds of things for whatever reason. The reorganization could not go through for some reason or another, but I wouldn't consider it like a standard merger, because it's not like Liberty is buying a new company or something like that.

So, and exactly, Cedric, that point is also completely factual is that if they don't do it for whatever reason, then the arbitrage absolutely would fail. Again, for whatever reason. So the main thing is that there's carry risk involved. Cedric says arbitrage means there's no risk. I don't know if I agree with that necessarily, because there's a lot of kinds of arbitrage that include risk. And technically speaking, like the purest form of arbitrage is just trading the same products on two different markets and taking advantage of pricing discrepancy. And there's always the possibility that the exchange that you're trying to trade goes under or something like that. So even in standard arbitrage, there's risk involved. Now, it's normally much lighter risk, but yeah, it's slightly different, I think. Nick says your buffering is brutal. Is the buffering bad for you guys? It looks okay, I'm fine. Okay, cool.

And there's a lot of different kinds of, just a lot of different kinds of arbitrage available. So, H says tender, arbitrage is lower risk. Yeah, exactly. Like there's different kinds of arbitrage, but it's just the concept of arbitrage is relatively straightforward and it comes in different flavors is the way I would think about it.

Because I can see, I don't know, it's just not populating the chart for some reason. This is the only downside of using thinkorswim on the weekend is that it can be quirky like this, because this is normally when they go through all their dev time and start updating things and you know, all that kind of stuff. So, the kind of quick recap so far of what we're at is we see volume picking up in GameStop. We see that this volume might be associated with earnings, but there's a big enough gap that when I look at other volume rises associated with earnings, it's closer in time typically. So, this is I would consider to be a slightly different effect than these and I wouldn't clearly or just straight up call it some sort of earnings effect because I think that there's a little bit more to it than that. That's kind of what I'm seeing from here. Now, when I look at it a little bit more in depth though and we'll take a look at the options chain now because again, that is something I can do that I'm pretty good at as compared to trying to come up with all these other ideas that I clearly don't know a lot about, although I enjoy learning",

Let's take a look. I got to order my dinner really quick. I think we're going to do, I think we're going to do barbecue tonight. What do you guys think about that? I think I'm going to do a sideopold pork, grilled veggies, a trytip, plate, chicken chunks, and then the wife's going to get a case idea. That's what I'm thinking. What do you guys think? I think barbecue sounds right. A little bit of barbecue. Briscuit? I kind of like bread. Sometimes it's too fatty for me. Yeah, sometimes I think briscuit is a little too fatty. Apos fades is what I think is that you like barbecue. I am, I realize that I'm habitual.

Let me know what the idea is. But anyways, let's go through this. So this part I think is really important because this is another really big pivot for GameStop. So GameStop did the at the market and essentially eliminated the overwhelming majority of debt. Then they're now announcing that they're essentially unshackling themselves. That's what this looks like. So I went through their previous document and just had a curiosity to see what are the deals, who they have deals with. And one of the things that's in here that's really important to lead through, to read through are the prepayments. I don't care so much about. I don't think that matters. But the periods that are the sections that I think matter a lot are the restricted payments change in nature transactions with affiliates. So kind of this section, six, seven, eight, nine. And the restricted payment section is really interesting because it limits a lot of what GameStop is allowed to do without seeking approval. Essentially from the debtors. So by canceling this agreement because now GameStop has its own freedom, they don't have to go through their lean holders and essentially the other entities that they previously were working with their creditors. And it gives them essentially full autonomy over what they choose to do.",

So by canceling this agreement because now GameStop has its own freedom, they don't have to go through their lean holders and essentially the other entities that they previously were working with their creditors. And it gives them essentially full autonomy over what they choose to do. So when I look at this, I actually believe this starts to bolster more and more the idea that we might be walking into GameStop looking to acquire something as compared to just investing all of it to reinvest it into the business. It does look like, because I don't fully understand why otherwise they would make this move at this point particularly. To me, it again leads me to believe that they're looking at acquiring things, which is actually pretty sick. So yeah, all right. So let me see this theory that we're talking about above. By asking. What else can I say all trades other than when you buy ask is done under a blanket algorithm dark? I don't fully agree with that. I can see the idea of trying to buy at the ask if it's done in mass, right to move something up. But I think you can have literally all cumulative retail traders buy at the ask essentially at the same time. And I don't think that there would be enough of a movement over a sustained period of time. The other thing is there's a pretty big misconception about dark pools. Dark pools still",

So that's the idea. Now dark pools writ large are in my opinion terrible because they they still lack transparency. Will he says are dark pools regulated? Yeah, definitely. Dark pools are really heavily regulated. Again, there's like strict reporting requirement. Let's take a look together. Dark pool trade reporting requirements. There's entire legislation on how ATS orders have to be regulated. There you go. So this is from Finra and this is talking about dark pools. And it says, though their name might make it sound like these venues like transparency or oversight, both SEC and Finra are actively involved in the regulation of dark pools. So all trade data for listed stock transactions that occur on ATS, they have to be submitted to Finra and the TRF facility or the TRF.

I'm catching up on the chat here. Don't forget five of the biggest call volumes last six months came in on Friday. Yeah, we'll talk about that in a second for sure, especially the order Friday.

The volume doesn't matter. And it's like, I understand that sentiment, but it's like partially true. Because again, dark pools don't inherently not permit order or volume tracking. It still exists. It just depends on if it's internalized. So yeah, the system is still unfair to a lot of degrees. Retail traders are not advantaged. Want to be clear about all of that.

Again, in my opinion, because if it were totally rigged, and we looked like this wouldn't happen. Nope. Anybody that's on the other side of this trade, like the large entities that get hurt when this happens that do have the controlling hand on a lot of stuff. If they had total control, this would never happen. They don't want this. So that's that's I just think it's important to look at both sides of this is all. I understand the frustrations that people have. I don't blame them for having them. But for me, I just look at markets in the world slightly differently. And even though I have opinions, preferences, and stuff like that, I do my absolute best to decouple those from my ability to analyze things. And when I'm analyzing something, I'm trying to do it as objectively as humanly possible. That's my intent. I still have bias. I still have skew. I always will. We all always will humans. But that's one of the reasons why I try to use kind of a statistical approach to things because I can then quantify things.

So for anybody else that is enjoying a seltzer water or other beverage, cheers to you. Or as my dad would say, stole a lot. Let's see. Sadiq says, what is weird before GME? He's diversified very diversified like 50 positions. Yeah. So Sadiq, there's a video. I have to find it. If we want to look through it right now, I would be happy to try to find it because I don't know where it is, but I remember listening to it. And so he has a video where he's talking about his methodology. And in that video, he talks about his transition from being a value investor into something else.

And when he has something that's valued and the stock didn't move towards that value. So I have to find where that is. I don't remember exactly where it is, but I remember him talking about that specifically, because I thought it was really topical. So for Sadiq, that's the recollection I have, which might be faulty. But I think that's why he went from having so many positions to then getting hyper focused because my guess is he was going through this process. Like if we look at his YouTube channel, you'll see that he's gone through massive, massive, massive effort here. And we look at his videos. He's gone through massive effort building like these different spreadsheets and being in the finance industry and trading for a long time. And then you find that at least seems like he wasn't seeing the success he wanted to see. So then he changed his style. That's what I kind of take away from it.

Sadiq says you don't leverage all in 10x on a guess. Well, it's not 10x because he used options and he bought options. So if you're buying options, you're not leveraged where you have unlimited risk. You're limited to whatever you bought those options for. So if we go back to this here, and again, we go back to one of his first posts that I see here, his portfolio is 113,000 with essentially 100,000 of that in options. So what this tells me is he's risking 100,000 on GameStop calls. Obviously, he's very bullish. And obviously, he really believed in his due diligence and his thesis, right, fully so. But this is a highly concentrated position. But I just clarifying that this doesn't open him to like margin risk or anything like that. This in and of itself is he's just essentially risking his whole portfolio. It's a yellow, right? As he talks about this exactly what it is. It's a yellow. Cedric says he doesn't do that on a guess.

Vladimir says all same contract with different dates that he bought. Yeah, exactly. So you can see that this top line is the total contract. And then these down here are all of the individual positions that he kind of scaled into over time. So we can see that he started scaling in in June. One second, I'm going to answer the back. Back at it. Sorry about that. Let me catch up. His first buy was 30, 30. That's funny. Yeah. So, but anyways, like he obviously is just heavily, heavily, heavily leveraging this play. Jimmy Zart. His thesis was never disproven and only confirms his thesis when activist investor RC got on board. Yeah. Well, and again, I can tell from the beginning that this obviously wasn't a perfectly timed position because he started like really, really light. So I see 50, 50, 50, 50, then 200. That's an interesting scaling mechanism that again, most traders don't really do. But what I can tell you is that there's some degenerate behavior going on here.

So we are averaging down hard core, scaling into a losing trade at the time. Obviously it shows really profitable at the time that he took to snapshot. But that is just classic.

I don't have to go up his high in order to break even and then it worked out, right? So that's awesome.

I do want to take a look at the options chain for the month. So we'll grab unusual whales for this and we'll go in here. Reese says, what was the date? This is five years ago. Is the date? There it goes. Oh, that's actually really cool. I didn't know that. If you hover over it gives you exactly one eight September. That's actually really cool. Dr. Z says he also knew the squeeze was coming. I, yeah, well, I think in his videos, he started talking about the potential of a squeeze a bit, I don't remember. I know that he talked about it though. I don't remember when. So let's go to the lives because one of these talks about a squeeze somewhere. Let me go all the way back to the beginning. No squeeze there. Here we go. This right here. So this, this was. Is this give me the exact date? Three years ago. Do we know. This doesn't give me the date. Right click. Cedric, where do I right click? Tell me. Do I? Yeah, teach me. There it goes. Again, you just had to hover over it. Look at me go. So this was September 4th.

So my guess is maybe as he thought the squeeze maybe I don't know again when he thought it was going to start to come on. But maybe when he when he was thinking that it was going to start to come on that he would scale in. That definitely could be something on his radar. Yeah, interesting idea. Yeah. Oh, Ryan says, Mr. Part, we asked where we are. Keyodo. Oh, that's so cool. I've only been around there. I haven't really had a chance to to check out Kyoto. That's so sick. Welcome in, man. Reese says in his DD, the short interest was an afterthought. Yeah, because to me, that looked like something that was scaled on over time. So that let me back up here. Because when I when I was looking at his first stuff, like, you know, when he was talking about these kinds of things, it still looked like a value play to me in terms of what he thought was happening.

But then we can see that there's a couple, couple call outs for a squeeze like right here, right? Squeezed orange or whatever that is. That's an orange. Yeah. So it looks like something that built over time. To me, it does look like the origin of the position was just a value play. And he really believed in the value opportunity there. That's what I took. So yeah. Sweet. All right. So now let's take a look at this. We can change into this. Rhino says, do you think this time, arcade will do it like you did in 19 several different strikes and explorations that keep the element of surprise? I mean, I typically see him in one strike at least recently. So my guess is, my guess would be one strike actually as compared to multiple. Because it seems like he likes to build into positions. That's another thing I've noticed at least historically, especially now when he's trading at the size that he's trading at, you kind of have to build into them over time just because literally the positions are too freaking large to just hop in them all at once.

And the reason why I say that is because I know when he, I think when he rotated from when he rotated at least whether it was selling shares, selling partial, but when he moved into Chewie, however, that played out for him, one of the things that I have to imagine is that he still wants to play GameStop. And I think it's been such a big part of what he does. So the interesting thing about this position is I would not be shocked if we get a portfolio update from him soon that will show the Chewie position still to some degree and then in options position in GameStop. That's one of my guesses. And the reason why I guess that is because if we take a look at his portfolio and let's take a look through all the way up here, guess what? He had 268 million dollars based on the math for his Chewie position assuming that he had gotten in somewhere around here somewhere like what is this nonsense? I don't understand why these charts won't load. Stop this immediately.

Hold on, let me make sure I'm on the right date. Do you guys know which date it was specifically? Of Vladimir says he can sell Chewie down to 5.1? No, isn't it below 5? June 24th, okay, I was on the right date. Thank you, Rhino. No, I think you're right because that's the date that I remember too. But Vladimir off-put and I think it's if it's sub 5 because it's once you cross the 5 threshold, it starts and then I think if it's sub 5, then he would have to file the amendment within 10 days of the transaction.

So going back to the hypothesis here, now that we got the 10 foil hat on and we can get dirty with it, if we come back over here and we look at this, we know that he has a 234 million position in Chewie.

If there's some sort of residual GameStop position, and if he still has a decent amount of money in order to put on a position like this, to probably play earnings, that's what I expected as. So this looks very similar to Cat behavior. Also in terms of the time of entry of the trade towards the end of the day, he's very commonly, I think, doing that because again, like more professional traders, like myself, we know that there's more liquidity there. So that is also why I think he's doing that towards the end of the day. So yeah, I think this absolutely could be him. Cedric says people do not want him to sell GameStop. But I also think he did and that it's actually bullish because he come back and the price didn't move. Yeah, I mean, the idea that he didn't sell any GameStop to get into Chewy, I think is possible somehow. But I would deem that very unlikely personally. And I think the highest probability scenario is he likely sold a good chunk if not all of his GameStop to move into Chewy for whatever reason.

Okay. Okay. Yeah, so anyways, that's what it looks like to me. Now, Ryan says we do not know how much many had and how much how much is using and what we know, he moved to Chewy and he has more than 20 million to buy other options position, maybe not 120 million, but maybe 40. Yeah, or maybe 660 K. I think this is absolutely true. Monkall says it's possible is possible RK kept GME shares hedge position with 25 long dated puts leveraged by empowered gain from GME to hedge for his two positions. I don't see him buying puts. Yeah, I just do not see that as part of his approach at all. Again, just an opinion, but everything that this dude has talked about is not that. Yeah. Um, so anyways, a couple things to highlight here. Cedric says could he sell calls on his position for Chewy, maybe? Um, he could. I'm not sure. I'm not sure that he would, but he could. I haven't seen, I haven't really seen a lot of his behavior when it comes to selling, right? So even in this case, he, he didn't",

This is another thing I learned about him. I think that you guys told me is that like, you actually used to get beat up a little bit, you know, proverbially on like these, forums and stuff, which I think is really interesting. So, Cedric says we never saw him hold shares too. Yeah, we definitely see, we've seen him hold shares, but we haven't, I haven't seen him downsize his shares. I think it was somewhere in here. No, no. No. No. Yeah. These are all bought. Okay. I think it's somewhere in here. Here, right here. Finally, sorry. That took me a minute to find it. But this is the exact spot I was looking for. We'll click into the comment and see what the conversation was. Wait, where's the original or did he just, I thought that this was in response to somebody. Yeah, okay. Hold on. I got to see because that looks like, that definitely looks like a comment that's in response to somebody. Here we go. Why did you keep buying after you averaged down around 30 and then it doubled to make more money? Okay, here we go. I was curious why you didn't roll to another strike or expiration.

I was curious why you didn't roll to another strike or expiration. I felt these ones were most attractively priced. Obviously, there's a case to be made that diversifying across strikes, expertise, whatever reduced my risk. But in my opinion, such actions may have also reduced my estimated returns. And quite frankly, that's not how I roll. So like that is so, so explanatory to me in terms of the way that he looks at things. He's not looking to reduce risk. So when I see this kind of thing, it just tells me that he's obviously supremely convicted in what he's doing. And by the way that he positions, even up until this point, his disposition, when he made this change from value investing to this, it's the same, it's the same story. Because in any of these scenarios, like, let's take a look in, let's go up here. So in this case, he literally could have closed this position down when his portfolio was literally, literally, over half a billion dollars, billion could have taken this off. He made 175.5 million dollars in a day on these calls, half of a billion dollars. If he cared about risk at all, he would have started scaling down.

There's no reason why you wouldn't start scaling down here, especially because if you like think of this logically from a trading perspective, his options were for 21 June 24. This is June 6th. He's coming up on expiration. They're not good till forever. So that would have been an ideal time to scale down if he gave even a remote fuck about risk. But this tells me he doesn't, like he doesn't, G-A-F about risk, just he doesn't, which is incredible. It's part of the reason why I find his movements so interesting to break down and analyze, because that is just highly, highly anomalous. You just don't see that. And it's incredible. It's so fun. It's so fun to look at. But yeah, that's exactly what this is. He did not care about the risk whatsoever. Let me see. Let me catch up with you guys. Let's see him.

Now, one of the things that I think is fair to assume though, especially when you see this many posts is you can definitely infer style from the posts, right? Like I can tell that he prefers individual strikes. I can tell the DTEs that he tends to prefer are not super short. I can tell that he prefers to wait his options plays over his equity plays. Like there's a lot of details I can pick up simply from analyzing a series of trades from somebody. You can pick up a lot of their behaviors if you're discerning. So I completely completely agree with you, Mr. off Putin. But I will say that I think in this case, we can come up with a pretty good idea for the way that he trades. That's my guess. Yeah, Rhino says I don't think he's doing it for the money anymore after a few million. I would assume a man would be satisfied. Yeah, I completely agree.

It's time to take the tin foil off and it's time to do a little bit of market prep for the rest of my trading. But incredible hanging out with you all have an absolute blast looking at this stuff. I am so hopeful that the week ahead is going to be just super, super fun. Now the last thing I want to show you all just so that you have it for your record, if you're interested in looking it up, this is the SEC report on the 2021 squeeze and what they came away with, which I think is really interesting and really worth reading through because there's a lot of small details that I'm starting to pick up from it.

    "text": "it up, this is the SEC report on the 2021 squeeze and what they came away with, which I think is really interesting and really worth reading through because there's a lot of small details that I'm starting to pick up from it. And then the other one I want to show you is this, which is about off exchange volume market makers and talking about this has pieces about GME in here. So this is another like recent study that I'm reading through to pick together some more more pieces. So Ricky says my portfolio is hopeful too. I'm cooked if we go any more downward. Well, I don't know Ricky, maybe you're following the DFV model and just yolo yoloing out there. But if you're yoloing it, then you got to give the same amount of foxes the cat does with his risk, which is zero. If you're not in that same boat, which again, I'll keep it a buck with you guys. I'm not like that. I care a lot about my risk because I have a lot of shit that I have to keep on the table. I already told you all like I retired my mom through trading. So I do not have that same disposition risk to me matters a lot. So if you feel some type of way about the risk, then I would probably take a look at another position or change a little bit about what you're doing. So yeah. Chris",

Let me grab that again, because I can't pull it up in here. I don't know what's up with this. It's still annoying. So this is like two to one. Yeah, let's take a look at GameStop. All right. And you wanted to look at the 20 and a half calls from Friday. So let's go just to Friday. And then let's just look at the calls. And then let's just look at the specific strike, which is 20.5.

But yeah, age says, fuck the test. I want generational wealth. I hope you get it, man. I really do. That's one of the things that scares me, honestly, about the GameStop movement and the GameStop community is because I know so many people are kind of leaning on it is a way to change their lot in life, which I cannot identify more with. I grew up poor. So I really get that. But the one thing I would say, and again, this is just my perspective, I absolutely hope the GameStop thing works out for you guys to hit that generational wealth. That would be incredible.

But if it's for the people that are out there trying to actually attain generational wealth or to really change their lot in life, I would just consider the I would consider the calculus, right? Like I would look at the probability of that happening with your current portfolio size through a vector like GameStop versus the probability of that happening through another vector, maybe like a compilation of GameStop and then maybe some other trading vehicles if you have like decent experience or something.

And if it's something that you really believe in and it's throughout you want to go, I cannot tell you how much I hope that it plays out. And then for those that are trying to achieve generational wealth and maybe they have a risk tolerance, maybe closer to mine where I'm not comfortable yolowing everything I have into an individual ticker, pretty much anything individual other than like an index ETF personally.

It's all you. So there's nobody that makes sure you're doing the right thing. There's nobody that makes sure that you have a plan before you're placing a trade. There's nobody that bosses you around at all. That's part of the beauty. But that's also one of the issues that a lot of people have is when you have all of that freedom, you kind of have to be your own boss.

I'm stoked to continue following GameStop. We'll see what it does is coming week. The breath of fresh air with volume is sick. So I am yeah, I'm all eyes and ears on it.
