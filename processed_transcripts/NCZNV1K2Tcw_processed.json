    "text": "want to take a look at though is kind of this next bucket instead of going from one Jan 2021 to 19 August 2023 this looks at 13 May 2022 to 19 August 2023. what's the difference here this is actually when daily expirations and SPX were launched well actually technically it was the 11th of May but I did the 13th just to give it a couple days for the liquidity to find itself and notice how much better the performance of nearly all of these buckets are even though some of these have lower P L's look at the max drawdowns in comparison if I take a look at the same exact Top Line trade here where we just put on the short straddle and let it go and do nothing in that scenario we're not only positive but our Max drawdown is only 17.6 so the drawdowns here are much less part of this is because of the time frame the market in 2022 the tail half was pretty strong it stopped going through its you know overall aggressive adjustment phase but the other thing is we now have a lot of occurrences whereas in this case before every single day there was an expiration we were tailored to a smaller data set relative to the time span we were in so a couple other things I want to highlight here quickly managing the loss in all of these scenarios is clearly important the best compound annual",
