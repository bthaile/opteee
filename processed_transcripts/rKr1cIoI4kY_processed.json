    "text": "hey everyone eric here wanted to do a quick update on the small stacks portfolio and uh i've been a little bit more active in there than i was expecting to be primarily because i'm trying to balance two things in conjunction with one another and that's reducing risk as much as i can as well as capitalizing on opportunity as i see it emerge so in general i would expect to really be quite a bit less involved than i have been but i'm not opposed to making adjustments when i see that they're you know logical and they make sense so let's jump over the screen take a look first off i closed out zynga i sold that originally it was a eight and a half put sold it out on one september and i collected 27 cents i closed it for 18 cents so it's overall p l nine bucks again in this scenario it's really nothing to write home about it's essentially just commissions for a handful of trades or whatever but if we look at things in kind of a vacuum and use percentages to guide some of our decisions even closing that at 18 cents collecting nine dollars it's still over a percent return on the eight and a half put so going back to that message i continue to beat this isn't the account that you're going to make a bunch of money with turn in 5000 thousand twenty five thousand even a",
