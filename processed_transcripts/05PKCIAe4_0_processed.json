    "text": "a really common issue for new options traders is not knowing or thinking through what structure to fit into the trade that you're looking at. So what this means is let's say that you're trying to play some sort of directional breakout to the upside. You're expecting a big movement. Yet maybe you're used to selling puts or selling put vertical spreads. Well the problem here is if you think about the profit mechanism in this instance being something going up a lot and then you sell a put or a put credit spread or you buy a call debit spread. Well you're capping your profit potential. So you're trading something that you're expecting a really big move but then you're capping your ability to actually capitalize from that big move. So really simple example of trying to make sure that the structure you're selecting fits the profit mechanism that you're trying to capture. Be an outlier. See you later.",
