    "text": "All right, you guys. I thought today was an off day, but GameStop is well being GameStop. Today I was looking at the options chain kind of going through markets doing my standard scan quiet Wednesday afternoon. I thought we were just going to be managing existing positions, maybe see if anything weird is going on. And then GameStop does this, something super weird. And I'm curious if you could tell what it is right from what you're seeing here. It might be a little difficult to see this one, but this is the options chain from today, the 19th of June, and it's in the evening. It's like seven o'clock Pacific time. And this is what I see. That's really super surprising to me at this point. There is a 47 point increase in the volatility in the front expiration cycle that is due to expiring two days. The market was closed today, yet this is up massively from where the market closed yesterday. Now, if you were called from the conversation yesterday, the move down here didn't surprise me after the shareholders meeting came through, made sense. I actually thought after the shares shareholders meeting, we would have gone closer to this right from the jump, took an extra day, sometimes all bleeds out a little more slowly. But then I did not expect at all to see a near 50 point increase in volatility with two days left to go. The other thing is right now, I",

But then I did not expect at all to see a near 50 point increase in volatility with two days left to go. The other thing is right now, I cannot see a clear catalyst of sorts. I genuinely do not know why this would be up 47 points. In addition, that I also find really interesting is the next expiration cycle also went up 10 points. It went from 151 24 up to 161 17. That is also not in insignificant move for something like this. It's almost a 10 increase. So something again is going on. And as I was looking through trying to figure out what this is, why this might be happening, what this, what's driving it? I cannot find a clear answer here. I don't see anything in the options chain that's absolutely out of place to me. We did talk about these series of really large orders at the 30s, which is still massive. And then the 35s. But the problem that these orders are going to face is the insane theta decay that they're going to experience over the next couple days. So for example, the 35s, they have 18, 19 cents left of total value, but the theta decay is 17 cents on the day. So it means after a day passes, essentially, these become worthless. Even the 30s, they're going to",

So it means after a day passes, essentially, these become worthless. Even the 30s, they're going to lose essentially their entire value after the pass of a single day. Right now, they're worth 33 cents. Theta to K. And then it's 27 cents. So unless there's this some sort of massive accommodating move that I still genuinely don't see. And as I continue to remind people, I am not here to spread hype or fudge. I'm doing my best just to look at the data and share what I'm seeing. And right now, I'm confused. I don't see what's driving this as of right now. So part of the reason for this video is to ask you guys, if you're seeing anything that can explain what's happening right now, because I don't see it. Now a couple of other things that I wanted to take a look at was the volatility smile. We've been looking at this pretty regularly together now. And one of the things I did notice compared to what I was looking at yesterday was kind of twofold. The first thing was this kind of smile on the next week expiration is about the same. It flattened out a little bit in the tail. But the smile for this expiration did actually see an",

So I can't fully tell if that's just the market kind of dealing with this excessively high open interest with a really short duration left. And we need to see what happens to the 70,000 open interest at the 30s, because there was 42,000 volume yesterday. And these obviously didn't update yet. Today's not a trading day. The update tomorrow. So I'm really interested to see what this 70,000 turns into. And if there's significant buying going on here, that does start to get a little interesting. We can see that there's a lot of volatility wrapped around this specific strike 258. But again, I don't see what's driving us here. So interesting. Fine. This has even gone up since we're talking literally already. It was 207 85 when we were looking at it last and it's ready up to 20860. So this is not moving an insignificant amount. I wanted to share it with you guys. I don't know exactly what's going on yet, but this looks interesting to me. So we will see what happens tomorrow. Catch you guys later.",
