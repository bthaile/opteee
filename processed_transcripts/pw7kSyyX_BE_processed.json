    "text": "all right you guys I thought today was an off day but GameStop is wellbe in GameStop today I was looking at the options chain kind of going through markets doing my standard scan quiet Wednesday afternoon I thought we were just going to be managing existing positions maybe see if anything weird is going on and then game stopped as this something super weird and I'm curious if you could tell what it is right from what you're seeing here it might be a little difficult to see this one but this is the options chain from today the 19th of June and it's in the evening it's like 700 Pacific time and this is what I see that's really super surprising to me at this point there is a 47 Point increase in the volatility in the front expiration cycle that is due to expire in 2 days the market was closed today yet this is up massively from where the market closed yesterday now if you recall from the conversation yesterday the move down here didn't surprise me after the shareholders meeting came through made sense I actually thought after the shares shareholders meeting we would have gone closer to this rate from the jump took an extra day sometimes V bleeds out a little more slowly but then I did not expect at all to see a near 50 point increase in volatility faity with 2 days left to go the other thing is right now",
