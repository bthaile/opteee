    "text": "The absolute best way to recover from a losing trade is the same way that we recover from winning trades. It's to stop focusing on the outcome of an individual trade and it's to focus on the process. The reality is your job as a trader is to deploy a skill set not over days, months, weeks, years. But we're talking decades, hopefully, and multiple decades, depending on how early you start. Unfortunately, I started when I was 17. So hopefully, we got a while left in the tank. We'll see how it goes. The point here is that if you overemphasize the outcome of individual trades, you're looking at the entire wrong thing. Because no one individual trade should make or break your portfolio. It should be the process and the system behind it that works in the aggregate. So reward yourself for following the process, punish yourself for being too obsessed with the outcome of individual trades. Biennale or Cielder.",
