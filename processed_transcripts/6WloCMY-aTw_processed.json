So more often than not, you will see those kinds of holders buying puts. It's a cost of doing business. It's a cost to take some risk off through the earnings release. The fact that you're seeing this much directional speculative volume in a large cap stock that typically exhibits the opposite behavior is a pretty strong indicator. Now I got to say I agree with that. I agree with what that guy just said. And I was evaluating as if I was evaluating anybody else talking. That was actually kind of funny, but that's exactly correct. It sounds like something I would say. So the funny thing is and the reason why I'm sharing that with you is because so far take a look at what's happening in video. They're right now trading at 141 where they closed at 134. This is one of those instances where it's always a crap shoot. The last thing I want somebody to ever take away from a clip like that is like, Oh, Eric knew this was going to happen. The fuck I did. I have no idea what's going to happen. I have no idea",

I have no idea what's going to happen. I have no idea what I'm going to have for dinner, let alone what a stock is going to do. I have no idea. But I'm the worst guy to have an idea. But what I can do is look for clues on probabilistic outcomes and make a guess. That's effectively what that is. That's not me knowing what's going to happen. Nobody knows. However, I can look at different things, different analytical inputs. And then I can arrive at something that's like, it seems like X scenario is more probable than Y scenario. And then my job as a degenerate trader is to trade my half-baked idea. That's effectively what this game is. Now joking aside, the main thing that I really do want to drive home from that is that seriously, nobody knows. So whenever you get people that like make a call and then they go back and they say, like, Oh, yeah, I knew that was going to happen. Like fuck that person. It's bullshit. They don't know nobody knows. That doesn't mean that you can't say I think X is more likely than Y. And it's a tradable event for whatever reason. Right. There's a fine difference between those.",

This is not anything that I knew to be the case. And a big part of that absolutely comes down to literally that exact point. And it really is worth reiterating. So it's like, it's very pertinent here. Most of the time when big large cap stocks that are widely held go through an earnings cycle, they more often than not will see put side hedging. And it's simply because those people are not looking to speculate on direction through earnings. They just don't want to have a ton of risk through earnings. So to see that much directional positioning is quite telling among other things. That was just a clip of the pro stream that we did yesterday where we go a little bit more in detail on stuff like this. We go on and look at like the other earnings and stuff like that. None of that matters. The main thing that I thought was interesting is that the options markets did give us some ideas as to what this could look like. And so far it does look like they're having",

Now the other thing to pay attention to is who knows where this is going to open tomorrow. That's a whole other bag, right. So right now it's trading down at 140, 84. So it's already trickling down a little bit. There's nothing that says that this can't run down more. Who knows. No idea. But anyways, let's see what they're talking about here. That's the last person I want to watch to be honest with you. I just want to see like an overview of here. We start with this. Business booming. We know that they reported 44 Billy in revenue for its fiscal quarter. Yo, when you have companies that are out here just reporting billions over quarters. We are firmly in monopoly money. Like this is all fake. That's an insane. Like could you imagine like what is a visual of that amount of money? I'm going to ask we need a comparison. Give me a reference visual for 44 billion dollars in 100 dollar bills. Just visually how many trucks it would take up. There we go.

Yes, yes. Revenue up 73 your your markets. Happy. Futures are up. I actually am long futures right now. And that's literally just because the my near term expectation is that we will see this kind of bleed through. Like I absolutely think we'll continue to see this kind of bleed through from the from the news. So yeah, that absolutely I think is likely to continue at least for a little bit. Now there's a breath of data by the way that can analyze the frequency of reversals of big earnings beats and stuff like that. But this does look poised for post earnings announcement drift.

Use an AI computing system. Revenue surge 73 your over year to 39.1 billion just below the 39.36 billion expected by analysts. So this is really interesting because this is still a slight miss technically right they they were expecting even more aggressive metrics. So that's actually kind of interesting that it's still reacting this this nicely. Dark Mark says another way to help wrap our heads around the difference between million and billion is oh, I've heard this put in time before. One million seconds is 11 days. One billion seconds is 31 years. I've heard that one before. It's a really great way. And I think that's an even better comparison than pallets. So now we need to know what 44 44 billion seconds is in in years. I multiply that by 44. We're all dead and then some that's much. Certified find what are these little crowns y'all have?

I mean, that's really the whole point of a vertical spread is to decrease the total risk in the trade both felt by the Greeks. But as part of that decreasing of risk, you are decreasing opportunity. So I think I think a few things, but I think there's a time and place for them. In general, it's not part of what I do. There are absolutely instances where it is part of what I do specifically through things that are like earnings releases. And I'm trading a short strangle in tech and tech can fly. So in stuff like that, I'll add a cap. I'll add a wing to the call side. I typically wouldn't do it on the put side. I just take the risk. So the short answer is a lot of times you give up too much to take the risk off. And our job as traders is to take risk. It's how we make money. So it's mostly for those reasons.

In case you guys are interested, I'll, you know, start turning these into NFTs because are those still a thing? Do people do NFTs though? Because these are clearly just gold drawings and it wouldn't surprise me if somebody was like, yo, I need that on my wall. I don't blame you. I might feel that way too. So if we're talking about earnings, we have two big differences. A big part of earnings is rehashing what happened in the past. It's looking at things like sales, revenue, all these kinds of things, right? All the fundamentals of stuff. And as you can see, they are pretty damn good at forecasting what stuff is going to be, especially for highly traded names. There's way too much information continuously available that allows pretty damn good estimates to be made. So you can see that they were expected year over year to 39, 39.36. They came in at 39.1. That's year over year. That's a long timeframe to make that kind of guess. And they were damn close. So when we're talking about past effects, this is kind of just like recounting what happened.

And a lot of this stuff is way more the case of as long as it's pretty close or around what we thought it should be, then it passes. If it's something, let's say, for example, that revenue fell, it didn't gross, fast as expected for some sort of thing, then all of a sudden, then that doesn't pass. That creates a problem. Now, the larger component that's more important during an earnings release, borrowing these kinds of big changes based off of expectations is forward guidance. This is where we're actually getting a first look at how the company is expecting things to happen in the future, which this is net new information. This is stuff that we don't know. We can guess what forward guidance might look like, but that's way more of a crapshoot than tracking things like sales revenue, buying of new warehouses, all that kind of stuff. So the reason why in the last earnings release, and this isn't specific to Nvidia, this is in general, the reason why you'll see that kind of behavior is not because EPS or some sort of financial metric doesn't necessarily scratch the itch, but a lot of it has to do with the forward",

And if we go back to the end of February of this year, and we think about what that forward guidance looked like, you know, all this tariff ship was going on, stuff that directly impacts Nvidia is going on. And Nvidia is absolutely super susceptible to supply chain shocks in that way. They're not like some of these other companies that have actually pivoted really heavily away from some of the primary places that would be targeted. So that's a big, big difference. And it's a good observation. It's a really good observation. But the context of those two windows is super important for us to to acknowledge and understand one more making the comparison. All right, let's see what else came out here. Net income, 19.89 billion, up 31. They announced that new rules from the Trump administration no longer allow the chips to be exported to China, like that kind of thing, absolutely impact stuff. Adjusted earnings diluted, don't care.

That's what I'm seeing. Let's see, let's see what this guy says. By almost 4, about 30 minutes into the conference, called Susquehanna Senior Analyst Chris Roland is here to give his reaction to the results. Chris, great to have you with us. And I'm just reading through some of the comments that are coming across right now, specifically about the China market, which of course is a big part of Nvidia's quarter here. The CFO saying the company is still evaluating limited options to serve the Chinese market and losing access to the Chinese market with material adverse impact on Nvidia's business. How should we view, if the tariff that if the export controls remain in place, how should we view the China market and what it will be to Nvidia in a couple years? Yeah. So I think the big revelation about Q2 is that they were planning on shipping 8 billion, probably almost twice as much as we were anticipating they would actually ship. You know, this",

And there's no way for me to speed them up. I fucking hate stuff like this where I'm just trying to synthesize information, just talk fast so I can get the information faster. It's so damn slow. Okay, so let's see anything else that sticks out to us here. Roll a coaster. Yep, yep, yep, yep. So literally this dude was just talking about the longer term outlook in China. Okay, so let's talk about tariffs for a second and what this is likely to look like it going forward. A big part of this is a big part of this is trying to synthesize and war game. What's happening? broader and what the conversations are and why they are what they are without going super deep into detail on all that stuff we can if you would like.

    "text": "without going super deep into detail on all that stuff we can if you would like. But without diving straight into that, I think the safest assumption here is that the way tariffs have been going are likely to be the way that they will continue to go. So what that means is a lot of conversations and a lot of reconciliation about finding ways to avoid these really large tariffs on everything and a big reason for that is because the tariffs literally negatively impact literally everyone. So because of that, there's not like some sort of massive incentive to keep them in place. So when Nvidia is trying to forecast its future business, it does have to take that stuff into account. But again, it is a as a betting man, which I am as a trader, I have to assume that and it seems like the market supports this assumption that we're going to continue seeing tariffs going the way that they've been until there's a material change, which at some point there could be. But right now, Nvidia is back up to 141. The options market looked really actually aggressive today. And again, this is some follow up from what we saw yesterday. But I still think it's worth talking about because this kind of positioning is noteworthy. So we saw this bullish call positioning yesterday. And then towards the close today, which is really important, you can see a bunch of the call buying activity,",

And then towards the close today, which is really important, you can see a bunch of the call buying activity, which is speculative positioning. And then you can see put buying activity going up that put buying activity is mostly people hedging. They don't want to overpay. They don't want to grab the put super early. So you don't need to. But you want to just cover the risk for the event itself. And this represents more so of those longer term holders of the equity that don't really want to take a bet on earnings that I've referred to previously. Then that's a completely different group than the people that are speculating to the upside that we absolutely saw come through in force. So in video earnings here looks pretty solid so far. Full expectation is that the market will like that tomorrow. Now let's take a quick look at Tesla. And Tesla is in a little bit of a different boat here. Tesla has almost near schizophrenic positioning with options going on. And it's been absolutely insane, insane stock to watch. So a couple notes here is where we're seeing this activity, which we'll take a look in a second where the current OI is. But then also the way that the stock is behaving. Because just like",

Because just like Nvidia when Nvidia first had this larger sell off, one of my broader ideas that I share with people is that especially for long term investors, this was all a gift. It really is because the periodicity that you're going to see companies like this at these levels going forward in my opinion would be love. And the reason is especially something like Nvidia that's going to be at the epicenter of AI adoption, they have a completely new, untapped growth source that is going to literally fuel them for some time. Hold on, I just got a breaking thing for Trump. What do you say? You never know what this dude is going to say. So Oh, this doesn't look like anything. Yeah, okay, it doesn't say anything. And for those that don't know, there's also the current court ruling regarding the tariffs from Trump, which I was waiting to see how long it was going to take for the courts to get involved. Let's see if we can find an article on that. Court ruling Trump. So let's see. Let's see. We'll start here. The record Wednesday blocked the sweeping tariffs under the emergency powers law.

Okay, the ruling from a three judge panel at the New York base court of international trade came after several lawsuits arguing Trump exceeded his authority. Trump repeatedly said the tariffs would force manufacturers to bring on shore. Yeah, yeah. But for now, Trump might not have the threat of import taxes to exact. So this will be kind of interesting. The ruling mounted to a categorical rejection of legal underpinnings is some signature most controversial actions. Supreme court will almost certainly be called upon to lend a final answer, but it casts a sharp blow, which is completely correct. Terrence must be typically approved by Congress. Said he is the power to act to address the deficits. He calls national emergency. You'll notice that they do a lot of this BT Dubs, not just Trump, any president. They'll do the national emergency thing, which just allows them to circumvent some normal, normal processes that it's one of the cool things about just the American process in general is I actually like again, completely disparate and detached from the tariffs, the way they're going, all that kind of shit.

I think that's a good thing. Dozen states filed suit led by Oregon, which makes sense, because I mean, especially like this here, including why wine, wine, importer, boss selections, owner says tariffs have major impact and company might survive. That's a really pertinent point, especially for companies that aren't as inflation resistant. I know that might be like, well, tariffs inflation was have to do with stuff. I'm just talking about prices in general, just general price inflation. There are a lot of places that don't have the same capacity to tolerate it. I think that's a hilarious picture, by the way. I love it when you can always tell what a news agency, when they like or don't like someone, because they'll do shit like this. My guess is CNBC.

That has a huge say in what the market does. Nvidia is such a massive company. All right. So let's get back to Tesla, though. And we have a scratching thing at the door. All right. All right. We have our news analyst. What do you have to say to the people? Okay. I don't know if you guys are catching all that. He does like to talk fast. You are getting a little bit of a sniff. What do you think of this? He seems to like it. He seems to like the mic too. Okay. So now that we got our analyst locked in, let's get back looking at Tesla. So Tesla here has had an absolutely wild move. It continues to be a crazy source of vault trading, actually believe it or not. There's a ton to do in Tesla. And even with the moves that you see, it does continue to provide really solid risk premiums because just the overall vault in here is so high. Right now, raw vault is 71.76, which still places implied volatility percentile at 71. This is also a really, really great reminder of the",

Right now, raw vault is 71.76, which still places implied volatility percentile at 71. This is also a really, really great reminder of the difference between implied volatility percentile and implied volatility rank. If you're using implied volatility rank, that would currently lead you to believe that vault is low. Vault is objectively not low. Vault is actually quite high. So the reason for that is because the way that these two are calculated makes a big difference. And I actually have a video that discusses the difference between implied volatility percentile and rank and why they're different. But anyways, Thor, leave that alone. You freak. You literally just asked to come in here and then he goes over to the door and he's like stuffing his nose under the door snorting. The dudes of crackhead. So let's take a look at what's happening in here. Still long. Still long call volume compared to put. Let's take a look. What I'm most interested in is actually how this breaks out. And let's take a look here. So all I'm doing is eyeballing premiums, which is still very call heavy. Really call heavy. And this is all the out into 2027.

Oh, interesting. It's actually kind of mellowing out. Overall volume is actually slowing down. Not sure I would have taken it for that. And I mean, there's still pretty large. Still pretty large trading activity. Hmm. Pretty curious. So from a general positioning standpoint right now, it looks like there's a bit of a short pocket in the near term for Tesla, but then longer term still very, very much bullish. Still very much bullish, bullish skew is as far as I could tell. Still generally ranked on the buy side. This I have to be honest, I don't think it matters in insane amount. I do like to pay attention to it, but yeah, I like, I don't think that this is the the end all be all I do like to see simply because it can give us a sense of what the market is generally expecting.

I mean the majority as far as changes, let's take a look at total OI. Still centered in the front. So people are really playing the front end of this, which stuff like this again, you you pretty much see that all the time with more volatile names. The risk premiums in here have been insane. So this reminds me of a trade that I recently reviewed with the with the pro folks good old PRTA. So this one was one I forgot exactly when I entered, but this was just short puts. And it literally moved against me almost 40 and despite of 40 move against me, the trade was still profitable from the change in fall. So when we look at Tesla. It's still maintains really aggressive risk premiums. Even though on average, we've been getting larger moves than expected. Last thing I want to take a look at here is term structure. Let's see. So there's a bit of a peak. That's kind of interesting. Because this is obviously wildly low relative. 23 days. What expiration is the 815? Okay. Wow. That",

So if there's specific stocks, questions, anything you want to talk about, please start throwing in the chat. Now is the perfect time to start throwing that stuff in. But I want to talk about this two things. So for GameStop, we saw a couple really interesting things that as always, I think GameStop is a rate general learning vector for markets. And it is everything to do with the way that GameStop behaves. Some of what it shows us and some of the anomalies that it also exhibits.

Now this big of a sell off is a little bit heavy, but it does seem like the pricing for the Bitcoin transactions doesn't really look ideal. So here you go, you can see the recent release. I want to get the right number of how much it was. So it bought 4710, which it released obviously that message today. And the interesting thing about this is like not like top-ticking, but it's definitely not getting Bitcoin at a discount. Like this is pretty damn high. So the guess would obviously have to be that it was being phased in over the last month or two, because I think the way that logically would flow. So they really got in like pretty high. And I am pleased to see that they didn't over expose themselves with Bitcoin price where it is right now. That actually makes me happy.

Jonathan says does the document say exactly when? No, it doesn't say when we could take a look at the statement itself. We'll see it in a little bit when they actually report, but game stop Bitcoin investment, who's right now everybody's trying to figure out how much they got it for. Let's see what this says. This says 513 million. Well, it says it's worth 513 million, right? And that is a purposeful framing because they don't know what the actual basis is. So we'll see when earnings comes acquired 4710. Let me see what the filing is. Let's see a Bitcoin, a GME Bitcoin filing. Yep, there she goes. All of your questions answered. In one spot. Yeah. So it says he and says they spent under 513 mill, which is under 10 cash reserves could qualify for non-material amount. Well, it's again, we don't know what they spent.

Like again, the way that I would generally speculate it is they probably built a position of 4710 likely over like a several week period versus just a you in outright bulk by. But I think it's a what they got in my opinion is it represents a good amount meaning not a good amount in that like it's a lot. I don't mean it that way. I mean a good amount in terms of like what this represents for GameStop getting pretty good exposure. But again, not overexposing and it gives them still more room to play. Now again, the other thing is I'm not personally like super jazzed about them starting to load up on Bitcoin. I don't think it's bad. I don't think there's anything wrong with it. But they still are a brick and mortar company. So they still need to do their their job and they still need to effectively continue doing what they're doing.

And we'll just watch the close captions. But we are going to have to go faster. Okay. Innovative corporate strategies pioneering from a dying business, thriving business. This is cool. Oh, this is I'm going to play some of the audio. Exitious looks cool. I like what you say. The company was a piece of crap and losing a lot of money. The company was under a lot of pressure moving from physical games to digital downloads. So you have to cut costs. Yeah, the cut costs very aggressively and bring in physical discipline. I mean, that's like literally so pertinent. Well, let's see what he says. And we can speed this up more. Hopefully you guys can read fast because I can. Talks about the headwinds, company being under pressure, especially in the industry, need to cut costs. Why does it keep saying the same thing? Here we go. We had to move from physical games to down those costs under control, shift the business",

Here we go. We had to move from physical games to down those costs under control, shift the business from being so reliant on games to collectibles. So that's actually a pretty big peak, by the way, the fact that they're talking about like a bigger emphasis on collectibles because I think for a lot of us that actually seemed a little bit like a side quest, but this actually starts to make it look less like a side quest. And way more like a primary, like primary focus for them, which I think is actually highly relevant. Big focus on trading cards, grading. The company is profitable in the US, gotten cost under control. Can I speed this up more? You can only go to two times. Damn, damn Daniel. I mean, so far, really nothing has been said, which is a little frustrating because this is like a really short interview. I would much, much, much prefer to see like much better qualitative input because effectively, it's that we had to change the business. These are some of the things we did, which is good.

So he's saying that they bought Bitcoin. He's saying that they own 4710. Here we go. Ah, smart. This is a great way. This is such a smart way to frame it where he's essentially saying that he's not using it for direct speculation, but more for a hedge, which I actually like this. Talking about storage in direct comparison to gold, which is interesting. And then he goes into asymmetric upside. Here we go. So to no surprise, he essentially is saying we're not going to say what we're doing ahead of time as they typically don't. Okay. Man, dammit. Just feel like we could have got some better stuff out of that. What a missed opportunity. Dammit. So the summary from that essentially confirms the presence of Bitcoin. It to me alludes to future purchase of Bitcoin likely because I think in general, if they weren't going to buy more likely would have said it, right? But they didn't. So my guess is that just gently alludes to the fact that they're probably going to buy more.

So I would have been like that would have been a great follow up if possible. But understanding limited time and you know, it is what it is that I'm sure the interviewer did did what he could. But those are just some lingering questions I would have following that. Now the other thing I wanted to talk really quick about with GameStop before I just go to the chat for QA is we did see them confirm their earnings and funny enough. This is one of those names where we had a hint that something was off with respect to when earnings was thought to have been versus when it actually was. And we talked about it actually a while ago. And the options chain in terms of vol is pretty good at telling us where things are expected to be. So now we can see that the overall earning or the",

So I think we can effectively just apply standard options trading and specifically earnings training trading analysis. And as it gets closer, it's just too far out right now with it earnings at the 10th after the close. So it'll be in the 13 June cycle here. Cool. All right. So what do we got? Ian says super curious about GameStop 4.5 million position, the holder of the 530, 36 calls expiring in two days is still holding. Can you verify slash heavier thoughts? Yeah, let's take a look at it. There's a couple things that have to be noted though is again, we don't know we don't know that that's one person. We really, and it's unfair to make the assumption that it is. Now it's okay to speculate, but it's a bit different and it's important to recognize those differences. So this 30 may 36 calls.

So they actually have a pretty big position across these and then the same thing with all the 30 maize here with people selling out or closing out of 39s, 32s, 33s and 30s. So this looks like just of a lot of playing the front expiration. And if you take a look at the volume for the front expiration cycle, the volume shows a pretty big downside, which is people closing stuff out. Current premium is at 23.3 mil. Let's take a look at the, I want to take a look at the expiration cycle. So 30 may. Let's take a look at those. Let's find those 36s. Yeah. Oh, fire, let's just go into that. I was curious if we can see any, like, sort of the the larger larger trades coming through, but not so much. So let's go back into here and let's just go into the option chain itself.

The 36's. So they would have got smashed today on that news. Literally trading for 24, 25 cents at this point. Whereas the average fill here was at a dollar two.

And a lot of that has to do with the fact that Tesla itself is still broadly doing fine. Like on a longer term time frame, Tesla is still completely healthy here. So I think that's become a bit of a talking point actually to try and get people to be concerned about Elon and how he's spending his time. But he's always spent his time on a million different things. So people that try to make it as if like the stuff that he's spending in Doge is now directly coming out of just Tesla. I actually think that's a pretty big mistake because that time is going to be spent on a bunch of different things, right? He's in and runs a lot of different companies. So my guess more so is that it's something that's generally spread load. So yeah, I think it's more of a talking point than anything.

Let me see if there's a thing for that in here because that would be, that's effectively what I'm doing with my eyes there. Usually whales have a view where you can see the total call and put premium based on OI. You can do it by expiration cycles, but I wonder if there's a spot to do it all one that I just don't know about. Net premium. Oh, that's cool. Where's that at? Tell me where that's at.

Oh, is it talking on that main graph? That main graph isn't, that's not it. Let's see it there. There. Net flow. Picker flow page. Is it interval flow? Net flow. Oh, here we go. This is great. Yeah, cool. This would be honestly really useful on that main page. They should do that. So let's see. Interesting. Now what I would have expected. I mean, those are like really heavy downside spikes. 1.3 in 254. That. I wouldn't have expected that. That's a little more aggressive than I otherwise was seeing or killed be. Let's take a look at. All. Kind of flat to the upside. Kind of really flat to the upside. And then let's just take a look at. Altas. That's interesting. So. So. There's a pretty decent amount of. VAL. Coming through on like the. Right out of the money calls, but it still. Put skew with respect to VAL, which we can see from that other. The difference that's interesting here is that the call. implied VAL. He's like very flat. I mean, there's just not much of a difference here as you have. It's not until you get like out pretty far that you start to see, which is kind of interesting. So. It to me, it looks like. There's some pretty big",

There's some pretty big short positions, but in general, it looks like it's a little bit more bullish position. From like a technical perspective, it's like this is a good consolidation. This is a good breakout. This is a good breakout. So it does look like it's on a leg up. I think, I mean, really the next place to be right is all time highs. Because it's already playing in this next volume node. And there's already clearly an appetite because volume is expanding. So the fact that there's a bit of sale volume today that can be from a million different things. But there's definitely an appetite to transact here. So yeah, I mean, it looks like it's in the middle of a like pretty decent recovery rally. That's more or less what I see. Cool. All right, gang. As always, great catching up.
