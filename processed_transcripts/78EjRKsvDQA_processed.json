    "text": "what's up outliers two pieces for the market update today I want to talk a little bit about the broad markets because there was a bit of a shakeup today and a lot of that has to do with Jackson Hole and some of the FED comments we're seeing and then the second thing is you know we're going to take a look at GameStop and see what's going on in there so starting off with the broad Market bit of a down day bit of a heavy down day and when I look across the various indices you can see in the top left here the SP 500 had uh a pretty moderate down day it's essentially still just shy of where we were hitting previous highs this has made the best relative recovery and starting to reject back down but Q's is still worse off we can see Q's about made it maybe 80 of the way is back up to near term highs before it started rejecting down today and then same thing for iwm about uh maybe 60 of a recovery back up to near-term highs and another down day so what I'm highlighting here first and foremost is that it was down across the board everybody was down today if I were to Peg where I saw relative weakness it was in tech and you can kind of see that by the sides of this candle compared to the others and you can also see",
