    "text": "Creating a priority list, especially as a new trader, is extremely important. It's so easy to get pulled in a million different directions and then at the end of it, you kind of pick the little piece from this, this, and this, and then you don't really have a whole lot to show for it. So what I used to do for my work blocks is I literally would schedule time with myself. I would have a primary thing that I have to accomplish during that work block whatever it was. And then as I'm going through my research learning about something and I have questions about peripheral topics, I would just write them down and then I would create its own work block. Now it's not super rigid, you can dive around. It's purposely designed though to keep you generally focused on the main thing you're trying to accomplish and then you can add on the other things as it fits in but it's to keep you from getting too distracted which is way, way, way too easy now. And this is something I still do today. So try it out, be an outlier, see you later.",
