    "text": "Hey everyone, Eric here. Been offline for a few days now. Just kind of enjoying the weekend and still hanging out with some friends that are in town. But anyways, time to get back and start sharing some updates of note small stacks. This will be the last segment for small stacks. So I've been working on this portfolio for about three months now. Today just happened to be when I essentially flattened everything out. So over the last couple of weeks is when I exited my positions in croaker and Intel, which were the diagonals. And those were the last traits that I had on. And I took a second to kind of review the portfolio overall. The performance has been really good. And unless there's some sort of, you know, specific conversation somebody wants to have about the small stacks approach in general, which I'm happy to do. I think in general, my approach is pretty clear. And what I how I went about the small account. I think I expressed that over the last three months. So I don't really have much else to add to that as of right now. I will say though. That I am planning on doing another similar segment with taking a certain amount of money opening up a fresh account and then trading whatever that amount of money is kind of how I would now. So I'm still looking into that if there's any suggestions on account size that you would",

So I'm still looking into that if there's any suggestions on account size that you would like to see me do let me know. I'm thinking a larger account, something 500,000 one mill something like that. Because I think that once you start getting to those numbers, the approach drastically changes to the way that we invest as compared to what we're seeing. Okay, so let's take a look at the screen. And let's do a quick overview. I started on the first of September opening up some trades started with 5,000. Today, I ended the account with 6,817, which represents a 26.65 return. The two trades that really did me the best were diagonals. It was croger and then Pfizer. As I look through these trades overall, you can tell that the lion share of my return is coming from the diagonals, which is about what I would expect these stand to make a decent amount of money if you let them work. So the coverage strangles definitely lag. They only gave me 225 bucks, but that's kind of part of having a diversified portfolio. In some instances, I accepted a smaller return in the coverage strangles simply to balance out the more aggressive play with the diagonals. But in general, the account returned well.",

It was a good time in the market. So if we take a quick look. So this is essentially what the market did since we started at the beginning of September. It definitely had some ebbs and flows, which is good. I didn't want it just to move straight up. That doesn't help us with anything. So, you know, we had this dip rally dip and then we're in the midst of a follow on rally. But nonetheless, you get the point. The market during this time was not just straight up. It's actually pretty damn similar to where it was when we started the month. Not too different from there, which is again, a good thing. That's where we have a chance to see how a strategy works. So overall, the portfolio really didn't have a whole lot of trades in it. And that's by design. The thing for small accounts is commissions hurt. They can take winning trades and tournament to losing trades if we're not cautious. So I purposely do not try to, you know, super actively scalp and smaller accounts, plus I think it just exposes us to outsize risk. So what I wanted to really",

So what I wanted to really focus on here is talking about some of my key takeaways. So the first one is something that I've talked about several times now. And I can't help but reiterate it because I really think that this is probably the biggest component to this is that your 5,000 10,000 20,000 50,000 dollar account is not going to be the source of your future. Well, it's not. And the sooner we can get over that, the better off we're going to be able to trade because what happens is when we take a smaller amount of money and we try to turn it into our future wealth. We take tremendous risk and vast majority of the time we're going to find ourselves losing money, taking a step back and then having to relearn this thing all over again. So we've just wasted time and money trying to do something that we already know isn't that smart. So it is a pill that's hard to swallow, but nonetheless, you got to get it down because if you can't accept the fact that small amount of money is not going to magically turn into your retirement account. You're going to make mistakes trying",

You're going to make mistakes trying to make that happen. So it's the first note on that. The second thing is the primary purpose of trading in a small account is not to make money. Yes, we want to make money. The primary purpose is to make sure that you are developing the skill set because what's going to happen is in your account, you're going to invest. Hopefully you'll make some money on your investments and that will increase your account value. However much. What we should be focusing on is aggressively saving money. And if you are actively investing, developing a skill set that you can rely on that we understand can return a certain amount. Still adding your savings. That's how you grow well. That is how you're going to make a lot of money with investing. It's not going to be throwing 10,000 in an account and never touching it again just trading it, hoping it grows. It's not it. So that leads me to the second point here, which is less is more we went over that, you know, in my last section.

I do think that if you have a small account, you really probably shouldn't be trying to actively trade on a daily basis, you know, scalping sort of thing. And I also think trading earnings plays and stuff like that just doesn't bode well for these accounts. They can't handle big draw downs. And whenever word, you know, trying more short term strategies. Variance of returns is very high. So what that means is you can get on a role where it's a losing streak. It happens. You can lose four or five trades in a row. Well, the difference between a big account and a small account is a big account can exist beyond those five trades and continue on. Whereas a small account. If you lose half that account, you're completely on a different trajectory than if you hadn't done that. So it's important to keep that in mind. And then don't forget commissions. They exist and they they mean something. Next one is patience. This one really ties to the first one. This is probably most difficult for most of us. But again, I just continue to ramp size that first point. So I think that is probably the biggest hitch. I come across with people that start trading with a small amount of money.",

But again, just reiterate the entire, you know, goal of this is we're going to develop a skill set that we can rely on. And then continue to save so that as the account is returning money, we're saving money, which is actively growing the account. That's what we're really going to see growth. And then once you start finding your account in the 200,000, 300,000 range, that starts to become meaningful. Because on those accounts, you can return 10 make 20 30 K over the course of a year. It starts to matter. So just kind of again, keep the long game in mind here. The next one is risk control. I bring this one up because it is next to freaking impossible to maintain a good risk to reward profile in a small account. And I talked about that a lot in the small stack segments. So what I want to highlight here is not some sort of magical way to control risk in these accounts, because it doesn't exist, but it's more to acknowledge the risk that we're taking.

And make sure that our risk to reward at least makes sense. And that's really important because again, if you find yourself on a losing streak, smaller accounts can be completely debilitated. If that happens to any sort of extreme. So it's important to acknowledge the fact in a small account. It's very difficult, if not impossible to have a good risk profile overall. We're going to be over invested. We're going to be over allocated for most of the time my account was hovering 70 to 80 invested, where my, you know, my margin account was around 20. So it's just how it goes with smaller accounts. If you want to successfully deploy strategies, you're going to have to use the money. But that gives you a really limited room to adjust. So we got to be really careful with where we take our shots. And then the last thing. This is what it's all about consistency when we're trading a small account. We're refining a skill set so that we can be consistent in our returns. The reason why this is so important is because in this example, on a 5,000 account, I return 26.

The reason why this is so important is because in this example, on a 5,000 account, I return 26. It's a good return on a 5,000 account. It's like 1,600 bucks. Doesn't really mean anything. But if I can maintain some sort of semblance of similar return, obviously it's going to normalize and hit whatever hits. But if I can maintain that semblance of return. Well, as I continue to grow my account and aggressively save now, instead of having 5,000 of principle, I might have 10, 20, 50. And if I can execute the same way with that as I did with that 5,000 account with that 50,000 all of a sudden the paradigm changes. And this becomes a very powerful concept. Focus on consistency with these smaller accounts. Again, the idea isn't to turn this into your next car or house. Just focus on getting the consistency down because as your account grows in value, that consistency is going to become invaluable. That's the kind of skill set that allows you to retire early while continuing to earn money on your money that's in the account so that you're not actively drawing on it to live. You're making more so you can live off of that while preserving principle. That allows you to enable existing through draw downs. Again, think deep game here. It's really important.",

If you start to near sighted with this stuff, you're going to piss a lot of money away like the vast majority of active traders do. All right, that about wraps up the small stack segment. It's been fun. It's interesting taking a look at these because it is, I said it before, it's like Tetris. It's like a puzzle trying to solve because there's no great trade offs and you kind of have to just accept. Trade offs that you might not normally make in your margin account, but it's a good exercise nonetheless.
