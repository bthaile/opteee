    "text": "Taking losses is part of trading. If you want to be in the game long term, we have to accept that taking losses is part of our risk management plan. It should always sting a little bit. It should never be easy because we shouldn't like to have losing trades but nonetheless we have to accept it as part of our deployment. I did a video a little earlier. It's going to come out tomorrow on a losing trade that I had in Goldman Sachs. So if you're interested in learning a little bit more behind the thought process that I had going into that check that out and otherwise treat them.",
