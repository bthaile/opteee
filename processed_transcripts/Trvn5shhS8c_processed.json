    "text": "What's up, outliers time for your weekly GameStop update and things look rough around the edges. It is what it is, but let's talk about it. So first things first, we can see that price is continuing to drift down. We saw this pretty big down move on the 10th. We saw yesterday on the 11th a slight recovery. And then today it actually gapped up. It had a decent start to the day, but then it rallied back down. So GameStop is hovering in this next general value area. And this move down here does surprise me a little bit, but it's not anything too crazy. I think that it's a little bit early to tell where this next trading range is going to be established. But I do think it's super important to remember about GameStop is that right now part of what you're seeing is really also due to the broader market. The broader market is going through massive undertones of change. And what I mean by that is if we take a look at small caps just for a more like comparison. And let's just take a look at the size of the move from this most recent decline. This represents a 13 drop. That's not even using the highs from over here, which represents more like a 20 drop. So the market is struggling. Now I do think small caps aren't the exact right comparison for GameStop. It's a little bit more like a mid",

    "text": "most recent decline. This represents a 13 drop. That's not even using the highs from over here, which represents more like a 20 drop. So the market is struggling. Now I do think small caps aren't the exact right comparison for GameStop. It's a little bit more like a mid cap with all the cash that it has. But the broader point is it's going to be a little more volatile than something like the SP 500. And that's very much what we've seen. It's had a pretty big down move. But if we take a look at this most recent down move, down 24. So it's almost double that of what we saw from IWM. And then if we take it from the highs to where it sits now, this represents a 36 decline. So the majority of this move that we're seeing is really accelerating from this point in time. So what does this mean for GameStop? Well, it means first we really have a pretty big earnings coming up that's slated for the 25th of March after the close. And if we take a look at the options chain really fast, it just kind of vet if that makes sense for the 25th of March, we can see that the volatility reflects it because the 28 March expiration is at 105. Volatility, where is the primary expiration before it is at 83.6. So definitely pricing and earnings for this 28 March expiration. We're still maintaining really, really",

Volatility, where is the primary expiration before it is at 83.6. So definitely pricing and earnings for this 28 March expiration. We're still maintaining really, really heavy. Paul skew as per usual. Now what I want to do is see how we're positioned though for this earnings event. It's very bullish 3636,714 calls against 97 42 on the put side, which is pretty significant, especially for a non standard expiration to have that kind of skew. The next primary expiration, 21 March is at 99,000 against 26. And then this front is at 90 against 20. So 21 March and 14 March are about the same 28 March will be the next big thing to take a look at with earnings coming up. The volatility picture looks very similar across the board. There is a little bit of contango and backwardation mixed in across the terms. Now a quick update, however, on the coverage strangle position, this was asked and I definitely owe you all an update one because this is the exact kind of market that's worth discussing the strategy. So before I show you that I want to show you what it all looks like. So this is the position as it sits. I've loaded it in. Again, this is a pass through IRA count.

You can see we're long 250 shares at 28, 21. We're short five of the 17 April 23 puts, which are going to be topical here. We're short two of the 21 strike puts for a dollar 53 same expiration 17 April and then also 17 April. This is a recent change from I think yesterday or the day before where we took down some of the prior calls and now we offered two of the 28s. Now the 28s effectively are like in the money, meaning they are below my basis. And that's something I have to monitor pretty carefully because I have no intention of allowing these to be assigned there. But I sold them there because I'm trying to collect a little bit more money with this suppression. And you can see that the basis of my long shares is still 28, 21. So if we take a look at the overall utilization that we're sitting at, it's actually moved up to 91 because I've added these. The reason why I've added these is because my expectation",

The reason why I've added these is because my expectation is when I go to roll these that I'm probably going to try and decrease the size using some of the accounting for these new puts that I offer here so that I can start freeing up a little bit of money to buy shares outright because with us being 30 off of peaks there, I would love to grab at least another 50 if not another 100 shares with us down here in the low 20s. But I still need the underlying to stabilize before I would start buying in any significant volume. And again, this is all relative to the small position I have earmarked here, which is a 25,000 allocation. Now one super important note, if we take a look at the performance of GameStop from the start of this exercise is at 2431 now it's a 2199 that represents a 9.5 decline from the entry. If we take a look at the return on invested capital, this includes the total PNL, the total PNL of the position that I have as it sits today is still profitable. How is it profitable that from when I first started trading this position, the stock has gone down 9.5.",

And this is a long delta strategy, well it's for two reasons, one because of the short puts and how much volatility I'm able to collect from these. There's super high volatility trades. The second thing is if we take a look at the call side, again, they're not making a bunch of money, but they're also not making nothing. So the short call side of the equation is still producing a source of returns for GameStop. So even though the underlying itself is definitely struggling at the time of the position, my position is literally up money. Now I did choose to roll these so you can see I took it from the 25s to the 23s. These came down for a small debit, 205 bucks. I could just write that off as just taking the trade down, putting up a new one here, it doesn't really matter. But just so that you understand that the accounting here is otherwise differentiated in my mind, it is technically a role from this position.

If we take a look at the options chain looking back over the last seven days, I mean it's literally anemic. We're seeing the lightest premiums that have effectively I've ever seen. So GameStop is about as quiet as it can get from an options perspective. And then if we take a look at what, that's the wrong one. If we take a look at what the net flows represent in GameStop, you'll notice a couple key trends. Specifically, we did see a small spike in call flows yesterday, but the majority of it is been net negative on the call side, meaning people selling calls. And this isn't inherently a bad thing. This is also a lot of people that have positions that are just selling calls against their long shares. And it's a pretty smart thing to do when the underlying is churning down like this. So if we take a look at the last couple things related to GameStop, there's still this conjecture about GameStop's involvement in Bitcoin, but there's really nothing that's been very confirmed as of yet. We can also see across this that I thought was that like pretty interesting from last month,",

These all came through the 17th Feb as when they were reported, but I find that to be pretty interesting given the price behavior of GameStop sense. So the last thing I'll note is I think earnings is the next big thing that's on the table. And I don't really have these grand or expectations of earnings because it's really going through a broader cost-cutting cycle right now. So the probability of these being some great incredible earnings is very low. But that doesn't mean that we might not at least get some sort of hint of what's going on. I hope with the cash that they have, although I'm not expecting it as of this point, but it would be a great surprise. So it's a bit of sit and wait, manage the positions, no issues with any of them. I'm in a great spot with the coverage strangle. I think that right now is a great time to continue trading, especially short premium strategies. And we will see where the next trading range is between that",
