It's got to be like half a dozen plus. At least. Yeah. Yeah. We've had a really fun time exploring the markets and understanding the way that you're looking at things. And as we were literally just talking about before we press record here, we are now yet again. I feel like every time I talk to you, we're in these really weird times. It's either a global pandemic or it's some sort of financial crisis and here we are again. So welcome back looking forward to chatting. Yeah. I agree to you. And yeah, that we're dull moment here. Yeah. So I guess to start off, one of the big things that we had been talking about, obviously your your broad thesis. And before we get into the details of the broad thesis, how it's playing out and those kinds of things, I was giving you a little bit of context on a general curiosity I have. And again, we approach markets from different perspectives, right? You're a very macro long term big, big picture view. I'm very trade oriented day to day looking to just find what opportunities I can capture. Now, one of the things I find so interesting about markets is that they are constantly evolving. And there can be a lot of periods where you have",

Now, one of the things I find so interesting about markets is that they are constantly evolving. And there can be a lot of periods where you have an idea and then some sort of new piece of information enters the system that wasn't necessarily expected and then the idea changes. Now, you're kind of experiencing that to, I mean, just a massive effect, not even looking at an individual stock. We're talking a massive global system. And I want to understand the way that you think about how you're formulating these ideas. And for example, the melt up into the bust, that's a really big idea with very specific criteria that you've ironed out and you've shared previously. But it seems so susceptible to new pieces of information entering the system. So how does that play into your broader thesis? Are the underlying conditions so powerful that as new pieces enter the system, they're kind of secondary? The things are ready set or does it behave differently? Yeah, surprisingly, I mean, my forecast has not changed the logic. It'll be surprised. It's changed in a more bullish direction, actually. I've raised targets.

So, so I'm, that kind of helps a lot to not overreact to what is going on. And meanwhile, in the markets and on the street, most people are overreacting or it might be overreacting, but certainly reacting in a big way. And that only because the other part of me is, yes, I'm long term macro, but I'm also contrarian. And that just feeds into my stuff. Senments nothing disparish in a long time. I mean, this is as barish as you get pretty much. People are just assuming we saw the top. We're going down. And, you know, people are playing leapfrog in terms of how low we're going to go. So when I see sentiment at that level, it just, you know, it actually increases my bullishness. And in this case, because of the way it happened, and because of where everybody's position, I raise targets. So that obviously begs the question. The natural question is if you're thinking about, or if you raise the targets, which we'll get into, what's the driver behind it, assuming there obviously needs to be a catalyst to cause that.

You'll see the bond market rates come down, the bond market control interest rates, not the Fed. So rates will come down and I think come down quite substantially.

And, you know, if it's, people get scared of that because I think it's, you know, real problematic. I keep repeating. You know, the bond market's in charge of rates. The bond market is, you know, the vigilante is everything we want to call them. The investment firms that are buying bonds when the economy slows are going to, are going to buy bonds more bonds because the economy is slowly. And I'm not worried about China bailing out on their, our tragedies. I'm not really worried about Japan. Ultimately, and we saw, you know, we were at 455, 457, you know, several days ago and we're, you know, we came all the way back down to Florida quarter or thereabouts and now we're up in the four thirties. You know, rates are coming down. They're not going up. So all this hysteria about that just adds to the pessimism out there. And I call that a wall of worry that means people have acted on their fears, which means they're positioned defensively whether they're in cash or short, short tragedies or, you know, very defensive stocks. That means the next move will be out of that defensive position, out of that, it's buying power for the future. So you'll see, you'll see them come back into more aggressive positions",

So you'll see, you'll see them come back into more aggressive positions when it does clear. At least that's what I believe.

So I, and I think one of the last times we spoke, I actually think it was around now that you are expecting the, the bust to be getting close to underway, but it sounds like with the new revision to the upside things have shifted a bit. What were the, the primary drivers of the shift as far as you see it? Yeah, I'm actually my, my bust scenario has not, or timing wise, I've not really changed. It could get pushed out certainly. That's just the thing if this thing drags out. I'm basically, I came into this year saying probably a fourth quarter event, and I'm still saying it could start the fourth quarter.

Then I said, look, two weeks ago, we were at 440. And I had talked about in, you know, earlier in March, that it was setting up as a head and shoulder top in rates. So you, on the 10 year, it looked like you were, you know, you had a gap at 440. And you had a, a right shoulder that, if you did the perfect right shoulder, was at 450.

Obviously, part of that is just being played up to add volatility to everything. But nonetheless, there's absolutely something to be said about other economies getting closer together, XUS. So how does that all play out in your view? Yeah, well, first of all, I do think there are maybe 40 or 50 countries that are coming to the table. And I think we are going to see deals announced over the next several weeks. And as those deals get announced, even if they're not the big players, it starts to look like, hey, there's a master plane here that's working. So, obviously, the two main players here that are problems are China and Europe or the ECB. And also, they're not the ECB, but EU. And I think the EU's starting to come around.

And I think the EU's starting to come around. They're not certainly not playing hardball to disagree that China is. China was always known to be number one, the primary target, and number, and the biggest issue we have is with, obviously, China trade. And number two was likely to be the one that would play the hardest ball. They would fight us the most. So all I can say right now is I believe where the market is versus where I think it works out. The market, I think, is far too pessimistic about it. I think standard heads are going to prevail on both sides. It's in both our interests. Again, people, it's almost like investors want to think of this in terms of all or none. Trump wants all trade with China knocked off. And we want to bring all, well, everything back gone short and all that. It's at the margin. You're trying to get this thing turned around at the margin. And he's right in what he's trying to accomplish. I hear all the time. Well, I agree with what he's trying to do, but I don't agree with those tactics.

People want to portray him as a, you know, mad man, but you know, best and snowman man, he's got, you know, I think he's maybe the best treasury secretary we've had.

Then there's the other part of this argument that says in doing that, you cause a tremendous amount of disruption, distrust, and other countries might look at it as the US is less reliable.

We have, we don't have the steel capacity, we don't have the manufacturing capacity to convert everything over to wartime and roll out the military hardware we need. I mean, it's just not possible. Now, I know electronics is a bigger part of it today. We can probably do that. But I think national security is a big part of what he's why he's doing this and why he says we don't. And we can't stretch us out, it says to be done now. Re-sharing itself from an economic standpoint, yeah, I mean, you and I know a lot of these commitments are going to take years to build, right? And frankly, you don't know whether you can trust even some of the commitments because some of them will drag your feet and hope he's gone in three years, three and a half years and never build the plant here. But I think they're going to hold people's feet to the fire a lot, I think, to make sure this stuff is, you know, you've started your plant, you're getting going. It's still going to take time.

It will play a big role, I think, in the meltup in terms of the concept of re-sharing and the dollars that are coming in here now. But the actual production that comes out of re-sharing and the restoration of our industrial base is really a 2027, 830 type thing. But markets discount ahead, concepts do help drive markets. So I think the re-sharing will help the meltup, but the actual results of re-sharing, I don't think we see for a couple more years.

It kind of moves less bearish, more neutral and then bullish and then extreme bullish. So I think you'll see that play out over the next three to six months.

So, you're going to have volatility based on, you know, whatever he tweets or says, you know, standard. Yeah, definitely. One one of the things you mentioned earlier was referencing the 2020 bear market and then the eventual rally out of there. I think obviously the thing that comes to people's minds with that is had the Fed not intervene and did kind of historic measures. There's a good chance that could have led to a pretty big problem. Yeah, I was bullish. I was bullish in March of 2020 because of the Fed's response, you know, was 5 trillion. Not we didn't know 5 trillion initially, but there was a lot of money coming in along with a lot of programs from from Congress. So that that was what gave me a confidence that I don't think we're going to see that here by any means. I think we're in a different place for different reasons of bullish, but yeah, you're lacking, you're lacking anything close to that right now. There's no urgency on the part of the Fed.

We could just kind of take our time and I think if you delay here, you're going to have to play catch up and that catch up will help my belt. Now, one of the things I'm so curious about here is the relationship of the recession because typically at the onset of recession, markets do generally react negatively to that. And before you had mentioned that you'd view the recession actually as a potential bullish catalyst. So then I'm trying to understand the timeline as you're seeing it with the involvement of the current state, the meltup and recession potentially in like the next quarter. What does that timeline actually look like? Not again, specific dates, not specific months, but just the relationships. Yeah, so probably standard way people would look at things is that the market leads economies, right? So that the market would typically top out six months ahead of the economy maybe and start discounting the recession or six to nine months ahead of that. We're nowhere near. I mean, if we're in recession this quarter, obviously the market just topped out in March.

But I'm just kind of at this point saying, let's not jump to the negative side when the probabilities really suggest at least for me that more likely we're going to see negotiations and things.

We've handed you our markets for free for too long. You have two choices. You can either run into real resistance.

That I think is the more likely outcome of this, not everywhere maybe. But I mean, I don't get Canada. Canada, Canada, Mexico are kind of a different story in some ways. But when you look at it's like there's no way that we're going to be where we are right now in terms of hurting each other. It doesn't make sense. There's got to be a true negotiation in both those countries where they come around to some extent and understand. We're not taking everything away from you, but we can't have it the way it is where you're terrifling us to the point where we don't have much in your markets. And yeah, you have access to our markets. So, and he's obviously trying to accomplish some other things there too. So I just think I guess I have some faith in Trump as a negotiator. Well, and I think another data point that that supports pieces of that is I don't know if you saw this thing with the the Texas and Mexico like this water deal. Are you familiar with that?

And I think it's coming up this year. It's like every decade or every five year time frame, a certain volume is due. And we've never bothered with it really. And Trump is now saying he wants to collect on that water for Texas.

And we should be excited about that. And unfortunately, it is a negativity towards him, you know, and frankly, Wall Street's kind of bent their book too because they'd much rather have things as they were. They were fat and happy. And you know, Main Street was getting hit pretty hard. They're still kind of wanting to stay fat and happy and not worried about Main Street. Well, thank god we have a guy in there. It's a populist president. He's very much- he's sincere about that. He really understands middle America has been hit hard for decades. And it's time to bring that back. But for, you know, for two reasons, economically for them, but also national security reasons. Another broad question I had with respect to just the economy and the inputs to it. My wife and I, we like to travel a lot. We actually just got back from Ireland. And we notice when we're in a lot of these other countries, when you go into convenience stores, when you go into gas stations, when you go into shopping centers, you notice that it's like mostly local people that are just working those, you know, lower level jobs, those base level jobs.

And a lot of places in the US still do that. But then there's also a lot of places that don't or a litany of different reasons, living wages and stuff like that. The question I have with respect to the economy and employment is what effect does that have that like the the base middle class quote-unquote, which is also this esoteric term that ranges widely what people consider middle class. But what effect does that have when the the living wage and the lifestyle that those kind of people would want to be able to work for seem to not either be available, not desirable, both of those I think exist to a pretty big degree to the individual? What effect does that have on the economy? And then I'm curious about the reshoring effect here. Like how many Americans are going to be actually really excited to go to these kinds of jobs potentially? Yeah, it's going to it's probably going to have to evolve you know as always it's not going to be instant. Yeah, we're you know we're giving up college, we're going to you know work in a factory or whatever. It'll evolve then the jobs are going to be very different robotics who's going to play a role etc.",
