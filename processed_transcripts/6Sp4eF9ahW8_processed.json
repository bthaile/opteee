It's got to be like half a dozen plus. At least. Yeah. Yeah. We've had a really fun time exploring the markets and understanding the way that you're looking at things. And as we were literally just talking about before we press record here, we are now yet again. I feel like every time I talk to you, we're in these really weird times. It's either a global pandemic or it's some sort of financial crisis and here we are again. So welcome back looking forward to chatting. Yeah. I agree to you. And yeah, that we're dull moment here. Yeah. So I guess to start off, one of the big things that we had been talking about, obviously your your broad thesis. And before we get into the details of the broad thesis, how it's playing out and those kinds of things, I was giving you a little bit of context on a general curiosity I have. And again, we approach markets from different perspectives, right? You're a very macro long term big, big picture view. I'm very trade oriented day to day looking to just find what opportunities I can capture. Now, one of the things I find so interesting about markets is that they are constantly evolving. And there can be a lot of periods where you have",

Now, one of the things I find so interesting about markets is that they are constantly evolving. And there can be a lot of periods where you have an idea and then some sort of new piece of information enters the system that wasn't necessarily expected and then the idea changes. Now, you're kind of experiencing that to, I mean, just a massive effect, not even looking at an individual stock. We're talking a massive global system. And I want to understand the way that you think about how you're formulating these ideas. And for example, the melt up into the bust, that's a really big idea with very specific criteria that you've ironed out and you've shared previously. But it seems so susceptible to new pieces of information entering the system. So how does that play into your broader thesis? Are the underlying conditions so powerful that as new pieces enter the system, they're kind of secondary, the things are ready set or does it behave differently? Yeah, surprisingly, I mean, my forecast has not changed the logic. It'll be surprised. It's changed in a more bullish direction, actually. I've raised targets. So surprisingly, you know, as big as the tariff's hour, as big as what's going on right now is my macro underlying macro thesis, the underlying fundamentals and underlying thesis that is getting me to",

Part of that is because I'm making some assumptions that, you know, the tariff situation will play out and it won't be what we see now. I mean, you saw in the last two or three weeks the reaction. And, you know, your crowd reacts instantly to that and goes to the worst case, right? And then if the tape joins them, they just really go crazy on the downside. You know, I'm stepping back and saying, what the dust settle? It's not, this is not what you're going to see over the next several months. You know, he's negotiating. Doesn't mean we won't have tariffs, but they're not going to be these tariffs. And, you know, St. Louis heads will prevail, etc. And not the Trump isn't sincere, but because he will keep tariffs if he has to.

So, so I'm, that kind of helps a lot to not overreact to what is going on. And meanwhile, in the markets and on the street, most people are overreacting or it might be overreacting, but certainly reacting in a big way. And that only, because the other part of me is, yes, I'm long term macro, but I'm also contrarian. And that just feeds into my stuff. Sentiments not been disparishing a long time. I mean, this is as barishes you get pretty much. People are just assuming we saw the top. We're going down. And, you know, people are playing leapfrog in terms of how low we're going to go. So when I see sentiment at that level, it just, you know, it actually increases my bullishness. And in this case, because of the way it happened, because of wherever based position, I raised targets.

That's not like some sort of massive positive catalyst unless it's combined with a lot of better, you know, agreements that are made. So yeah, tariffs, tariffs go away on our side, perhaps, you know, even the 10th or maybe, but 10 or not 10. We'll be back down from these, the extra tariffs. The other side is going to have to give up a lot of tariffs. So I mean, we already have heard that Vietnam's willing to go to zero. If we go to zero, there's other trade barriers that cause, you know, there's more to be done. But I think what you're going to see in Mexico and Canada and in the Asian ring and in Europe is tariffs may not go away, but they're coming down.

I go, no, the market will go up into that recession, as long as it's viewed as a containable recession. You know, if it turns into something harder land, much harder landing, then that may end my thesis. But at this point in time, you're not seeing any of that. And I think the odds are that this low economy will certainly help the bond market in spite of the, you know, the history the last week. You'll see the bond market rates come down, the bond market control interest rates, not the Fed. So rates will come down and I think come down quite substantially. You know, I'm still calling for a sub three percent by, sometimes the summer that doesn't mean by June, but certainly, you know, by, by August or September, you could be looking at sub three percent, maybe even two and a half percent on the 10 year. That's a huge amount of ease without any Fed, you know, we're having this tip for tad or a battle between Powell and Trump. Neither one likes the other one.

Neither one likes the other one. And, you know, if it's, if people get scared of that because they think it's, you know, real problematic, I keep, I keep repeating. You know, the bond market's in charge of rates. The bond market is, you know, the vigilante is what everyone would have called me. Investment firms that are buying bonds when the economy slows are going to, are going to buy bonds more bonds because the economy is slowly. And I'm not worried about China bailing out on their our tragedies. I'm not really worried about Japan. Ultimately, and we saw, you know, we were at 455, 457, you know, several days ago and we're, you know, we came all the way back down to four and a quarter or thereabouts and now we're up in the four thirties. You know, rates are coming down. They're not going up. So all this history about that just adds to the pessimism out there. And I call that a wall of worry that means people have acted on their fears, which means their position defensively, whether they're in cash or short, short tragedies or, you know, very defensive stocks. That means the next move will be out of that defensive position, out of that, it's buying power for the future.",

So you'll see, you'll see them come back into more aggressive positions when the dust clears. At least that's what I believe. So, and, and before the tariffs, you know, was that lower rates, lower economy, lower inflation scenario that was going to drive us to the SP 7500 now, I'm saying SP 8000. So, and I think one of the last times we spoke, I actually think it was around now that you were expecting the, the bust to be getting close to underway, but it sounds like with the new revision to the upside, things have shifted a bit. What were the, the primary drivers of the shift as far as you see it? Yeah, I'm actually my, my bus scenario has not, or timing wise, has not really changed. It could get pushed out certainly. It is just thing if this thing drags out. I'm basically, I came into this year saying probably a fourth quarter event. And I'm still saying it could start the fourth quarter. Doesn't mean it has to. It could, you know, wait until next year, but I haven't changed a lot of timing because of this, because it's, it's dependent on how",

But the market, in my opinion, that very violent sell-off bottoms, you know, down at 48 or 900 on the SP, and we've had a pretty good runoff of that. There's a lot of people out there expecting a retester, new lows. It's possible. I don't think it's likely. I think we're starting our, you know, starting our next leg up. And so, you know, it's not going to be recognized as that for a little while because I think people are still worried about that second leg, or the second tune to drop. But you could turn around a couple weeks and say, hey, we're back near the highs, you know, or we're back, you know, we're back at the high five thousand. So, so I don't think time-wise, we, you know, would might have lost a month. Got it. Now, what do you make of the relationship with bonds and equities here? Because obviously, for a while, they became highly correlated. And it seemed like they were starting to resume a normal, less correlated relationship.

So I'm curious your thoughts on the interplay. Yeah, it's, I, I mean, I continue to expect that bond and stocks are going to have big rallies into the summer. So it's not just the stock market. I think the bond, as I said, rates are going to, you know, 10 years going to come down under 3. That's a big rally from here. I, I think, you know, slowing economy, lower inflation helps stocks, but it also helps bonds. I just don't buy into this. It was a, it was a weird panic, I thought that we all said we pushed the rate back from sub four 20 back up to 450 on the 10 year. And people were panic that I said, look, two weeks ago, that we were at 440. And I had talked about in, in earlier in March, that it was setting up as a head and shoulder top in rates. So you on the 10 year, it looked like you were, you know, you had a gap at 440. And you had a, a right shoulder that if you did the perfect right shoulder was at 450. And bonds got up to about 437,",

And then when he launched the tariffs, the curveball obviously was the 10 on everything. That wasn't really message ahead of time very well or at all.

When you're looking at the relationships between the various economies that are out there against the tariffs as they've been set out, what are your thoughts on the game of chicken that's now happening? Because we can see some countries to your point, definitely Vietnam. A lot of those smaller countries have definitely started saying, okay, we'll play ball. And then there's other countries that are saying like China, okay, let's play. And there's also the artifact of now Russia and China are even talking about doing natural gas deals together. Obviously, part of that's just being played up to add volatility to everything. But nonetheless, there's absolutely something to be said about other economies getting closer together. X US. So how does that all play out in your view? Yeah, well, first of all, I do think there are maybe 40 or 50 countries that are coming to the table. And I think we are going to see deals announced over the next several weeks. And as those deals get announced, even if they're not the big players, it starts to look like, hey, there's a master playing here that's working. So, you know, obviously the two main players here that are problems are China and Europe or the ECB. And also, they're not the ECB, but EU. And I think the EU",

And I think the EU starting to come around, they're not certainly not playing hardball to the degree that China is. China was always known to be number one, the primary target and the biggest issue we have is what obviously China trade. And number two was likely to be the one that would play the hardest ball. They would fight us the most. So all I can say right now is I believe where the market is versus where I think it works out. The market, I think, is far too pessimistic about it. I think standard heads are going to prevail on both sides. It's in both our interests. Again, people, it's almost like investors want to think of this in terms of all or none. Trump wants all trade with China knocked off. And we want to bring all everything back on shore and all that. It's at the margin. You know, you're trying to get this thing turned around at the margin. And he's right in what he's trying to accomplish. I hear all the time.

But I think in the end, what you're going to have, if you fast forward a month, baby, a month or a month and a half, is you're going to have what looks like for your trade around the world, lower tariffs from our trading partners allowing us to have more access to their markets, not free access. I don't think we're going there, probably. And, and you're going to be able to look and say, you know, a month ago or a month and a half ago, I thought everything was going to crash, we were going to have, you know, this was in 1930s.

And, you know, when you shift from sentiment that's, you know, based on dire outlook to sentiment that says, hey, things are, you know, may not be, you know, perfect, but things are looking better than they were coming into this. You know, it's a big, big move, a big gap between where you were position or where you need to be position. And that's why markets, you know, get it up. Now, one of the things I've seen mentioned about the approach with tariffs so far, which I do find interesting is there's a really good argument, I think, that the path taken so far definitely albeit aggressive does lead to more things happening more quickly. Then there's the other part of this argument that says in doing that, you cause a tremendous amount of disruption, distrust, and other countries might look at it as the US is less reliable.

Now, the effect of reshoring some of these industries, how does that in your view play into the broader economy? Because one of the interesting things I've seen discussed is this conversation around GDP, GDP slowing, cutting government spending, government spending is a big part of GDP. And then you have the conversation of is that even GDP? And it's like these different levels to the discussion. But the reshoring element is really interesting to me.

    "text": "you have the conversation of is that even GDP? And it's like these different levels to the discussion. But the reshoring element is really interesting to me. Because again, you know, I have a military background. And from that, I like that for a lot of reason. Because as anybody who studies war, it genuinely is one through logistics. If you have really good fighting forces, but they run out of what they need, it doesn't matter. They could be really great dudes, really capable, but you can't shoot nothing. So I find from a defensive perspective, it very interesting and pertinent COVID gave us a little bit of a preamble on what this could look like. But from an economic lens, how does the reshoring element fit into your broader assessment of the economy? What kind of impact does that? Yeah, first of all, I think you're dead on. And that's where I think Wall Street's kind of short-sighted is Trump, if this were purely economic and not national security, then you could say, well, you're making big bets here. And why did we need to do that? Yes, certainly, we would like more industry back here, et cetera. But you're really disrupting a lot to get that. But national security almost demands that we do this. We could, as you well know, we could not do a World War II again. We don't have the steel capacity, we don't have the manufacturing capacity to convert everything over to",

We can't stretch us out, it says we don't know. Reshoring itself from an economic standpoint, yeah, I mean, you and I know a lot of these commitments are going to take years to build, right? And frankly, you don't know whether you can trust even some of the commitments, because some of them will drag your feet and hope he's gone in three years, three and a half years, and never build the plant here. But I think they're going to hold people's companies' feet to the fire a lot, I think, to make sure this stuff is, you know, you've started your plant, you're getting going.

I'm not expecting reshoring to jumpstart this economy and get us out of this, you know, in the next year. I think reshoring will play a big role in the recovery after the bust. It will play a big role, I think, in the meltup in terms of the concept of reshoring and the dollars that are coming in here now, but the actual production that comes out of reshoring and the, you know, the restoration of our industrial base is really a, you know, 2027, 839, 30 type thing.

This same thing here is the sentiment turned so was negative going into it and turned so negative that I said these breaks are, you know, I don't want to call them false breakdowns, but they really were very quick and very temporary.

All of sudden, the tape moving up is going to first cross some short covering, which we've already seen some of that. But there's a lot more that can happen. And then as the tape continues, it just drags people back into the bullish side. You know, no matter what, momentum, you know, causes sentiment. You know, people really react to the tape and they've react very negatively to a negative tape. I think it won't be that long before you start seeing that turn around and people have to remember, you start from the lower left, move to the upper right, you know, on sentiment too. So you start at the bottom with, you know, deep bearer sentiment. That's a bullish thing when sentiment is this deeply bearish. And it doesn't move straight to bullish. It kind of moves less bearish, you know, more neutral and then bullish and then extreme bullish. So I think you'll see that play out over the next three to six months. Now, when I'm looking at the major indices here, I mean, from like a three month perspective, all of them are still pretty firmly down sloping. There was that bear recovery on the ninth of April. But then it's kind of been stalling and starting to fall past that. So are you viewing this just bouncing back and forth that we're kind of doing now since it's",

And so, you know, if I were betting, I would bet slightly bet that we're probably up from here that you get a day or two of this, you know, make it look like it's rolling back over, but it doesn't last.

One one of the things you mentioned earlier was referencing the 2020 bear market and then the eventual rally out of there. I think obviously the thing that comes to people's minds with that is had the Fed not intervene and did kind of historic measures. There's a good chance that could have led to a pretty big problem. Yeah, I was bullish. I was bullish in March of 2020 because of the Fed's response, you know, was 5 trillion. Not we didn't know 5 trillion initially, but there was a lot of money coming in along with a lot of programs from from Congress. So that that was what gave me a confidence that I don't think we're going to see that here by any means.

I don't, you know, I really ignore Fed commentary in between meetings. You know, it's, they're doing two things. They're trying to send the message and Waller came out and talked more like eases and far away. And the next day, Powell's pretty much putting him back in his place with, you know, we're not anywhere near thinking that. So I think they want to convey a message that they're not in hurry to ease that they're, I think they're wrong in terms of feeling like they're in a kind of a great spot where they can pivot either way, depending on what, you know, what they get. To me, they're not really as, as is typical of the Fed. They're not really getting the leads and lags.

I think it's pretty easy to look at what the tariffs are doing to companies and to worldwide trade and say, there's going to be disruption in the economy, not initially because initially you're getting numbers that are probably people buying ahead of the tariffs, right? So you're getting, you're getting some, like, you have good retail sales. And you're seeing some things that say the economy looks pretty good. You can't go by those numbers because those are basically pulling from the future. I think once we get out of month or two, numbers could not crater, but be down quite a bit.

We could just kind of take our time and I think if you delay here, you're going to have to play catch up and that catch up will help my belt. Now, one of the things I'm so curious about here is the relationship of the recession because typically at the onset of recession, markets do generally react negatively to that. And before you had mentioned that you'd view the recession actually as a potential bullish catalyst. So then I'm trying to understand the timeline as you're seeing it with the involvement of the current state, the meltup and recession potentially in like the next quarter. What does that timeline actually look like? Not again, specific day. It's not specific months, but just the relationships. Yeah, so probably standard way people would look at things is that the market leads economies, right? So that the market would typically top out six months ahead of the economy maybe and start discounting the recession or six to nine months ahead of that. We're nowhere near. I mean, if we're in recession this quarter, obviously the market just topped out in March. I'm looking at it as it's and this is not kind of what we see typically",

I'm looking at there could be a period here where and I think there will be a period here where it looks like soft landing or slow down mild recession. And the feds responding to it saying, okay, now we got the ease. We're seeing that. But we're not in a hard laying scenario. In other words, a narrative will still be soft landing. Soft landing accompanied by lower inflation and maybe a lot lower inflation. And keep in mind that the narrative out there just a week ago and I think for some people still is that inflation is ticking up, not down, right? Everybody's worried even the fed worried about inflation. Well, I think inflation is going down. True inflation, the measure they measure is 1.3 percent, I think. They're below the 2 percent target. Housing is roll over because of these high mortgage rates. And you've got oil down at 55. I mean, I don't know who's looking at higher inflation here, I think. And again, the one thing that's pushing everybody to higher inflation saying tariffs are inflationary. Tariffs aren't inflationary. They cause a one-time bump",

    "text": "over because of these high mortgage rates. And you've got oil down at 55. I mean, I don't know who's looking at higher inflation here, I think. And again, the one thing that's pushing everybody to higher inflation saying tariffs are inflationary. Tariffs aren't inflationary. They cause a one-time bump in prices, but they also cause a big dip in demand. So it doesn't, it's not sustainable inflation if that's the story. So I think the feds got it wrong. Those are worrying about inflation to have it wrong. And they're within very short time. I think they're going to come around to wow inflation. Actually, blowing towards that 2 percent target pretty fast. So you have lower inflation, soft landing, even though it may be a mild recession. And finally, the fed at our back, you know, fed back cutting rates, maybe even pumping a little money. And that happening at the same time that the tariffs are starting to get normalized. The tariff policy is starting to get normalized. People say, oh, it's not what we were fearing. You get all that in a concentrated period of two or three months and you can have a rip-rowing market. I see. Yeah, I can follow the thought process there. What are your thoughts around the, you were saying tariffs may or may not be inflationary depending on the effective demand? But what do you think about elasticity's involvement in that? Because with how broad the tariffs are, they're absolutely",

But what do you think about elasticity's involvement in that? Because with how broad the tariffs are, they're absolutely are going to be components that are captured that will have different measures of elasticity and the ability to either experience a decrease in demand or just accept heightened cost. Yeah, it's hard. I guess I've kind of put it on the side line a bit and said, until we get clarity on what really is going to come with that, I still think the primary story is negotiation and if anything moving towards free or trade, not more protectionist trade, you have to do this to get there. But I'm just kind of at this point saying, let's not jump to the negative side when the probabilities really suggest at least for me that more likely we're going to see negotiations and things. Trump may be very sincere about liking tariffs as a revenue razor, but I truly think his primary use of tariffs is to bring the other trading partners to the table and say, enough's enough. We've handed you our markets for free for too long. You have two choices. You can either run into real resistance.

That I think is the more likely outcome of this, not everywhere maybe, but I mean, I look at Canada, Canada, Canada and Mexico are kind of a different story in some ways, but when you look at it's like there's no way that we're going to be where we are right now in terms of hurting each other. It doesn't make sense. There's got to be a true negotiation in both those countries where they come around to some extent and understand. We're not taking everything away from you, but we can't have it the way it is where you're terrifling us to the point where we don't have much in your markets and yet you have access to our markets. He's obviously trying to accomplish some other things there too. I just think, I guess I have some faith in Trump as a negotiator.

No. I never heard of it before either, but and I don't want to speak too incorrectly about it. Just at a high level, I recently was reading about it, but there's an agreement where as we were dividing the Rio Grande and whatnot that there's a certain amount of water that is owed to us by Mexico that we to Texas that we historically have and collected on. I think it's coming up this year. It's like every decade or every five year time frame a certain volume is due and we've never bothered with it really. And Trump is now saying he wants to collect on that water for Texas. So I think not, you know, aside from the actual details of that, I think it does highlight part of what you're talking about more broadly. Whereas there's this global negotiation going on where we're trying to actually reestablish footing on a lot of different things.

And his whole negotiation style is I play hardball and then we back off from the you know, see our deal. I start with my most extreme negotiating position and then we work forward from there. But all that plus all the everything else that surrounds the politics from 2016 on and particularly the left view of him. But certainly a lot of Wall Street bought into that and a lot of, you know, population bought into it. That's all part of why I think that everybody sides with, you know, we really have a strong reason to be doing what we're doing. We've given away our country for 40 years in a lot of ways.

They don't like him or they don't trust him or they have TDS, whatever. And, you know, he's got some good sword and good people that back him, you know, I certainly do. But I do think if you were to take a poll a lot of what's, you know, what's the rhetoric out there? What's the sense out there? It's coming from personality more than, you know, and dislike of that personality more than it is reality. Sad, that contributes to the bearishness, contributes to the doubts. And I think the picture probably a lot better than that. Well, it's one of those things that's so fascinating because it's multivariate, right? There's a lot of different angles you can take because the, the concept of him trying to bring back the middle class to reestablish it in some of these different ways totally can see that view. And then there's also the view of, well, if you're a person that's looking to retire in the next six months, you're terrified right now because of this damage that has been done that directly affects you. Unfortunately, because it is the middle class and the lower classes that don't have obviously the excess disposable income to be able to survive those kind of drops and be able to, you know, live",

So it's one of those things where it's just such a fascinating culmination of to your exact point personality timing issue, press scenes depending on what matters to the individual. Because no matter what, as you've kind of pointed out here, there's no easy way to reflate America without causing massive disruption. It's just if you're going to try to. And frankly, I think it's naive to say we can go along the way we've gone because Wall Street's still doing okay. And, you know, most people have equity in their homes and stuff. Meanwhile, we're hand in advantages left and right to China that we won't be able to make up grounded. We're really at that. It's kind of the same thing as last November in the election. It truly was, I think, a dual or die election. If it had stayed, I don't want to get too much into politics, but if it had stayed with the Democrat candidate, it was very much moving us closer and closer to globalism, closer and closer.

The question I have with respect to the economy and employment is what effect does that have that like the base middle class quote-unquote, which is also this esoteric term that ranges widely what people consider middle class. But what effect does that have when the living wage and the lifestyle that those kind of people would want to be able to work for seem to not either be available, not desirable, both of those I think exist to a pretty big degree to the individual. What effect does that have on the economy? And then I'm curious about the reshoring effect here. Like how many Americans are going to be actually really excited to go to these kinds of jobs potentially? Yeah, it's going to, it's probably going to have to evolve, you know, as always, it's not going to be instant. Yeah, we're, you know, we're giving up college, we're going to, you know, work in the factory or whatever.

The other thing I'd say in relation to, so you're right, I do think, you know, these other countries and you see locals, they're working in their towns and they're basically, it's like we used to be. The other thing I will say is that without government spending, without the huge blow up in our government, the huge growth of our government over the last 30 years, everybody would realize our standard living has been dropping, but it was held together because of lots of handouts, lots of entitlements, lots of things. And unfortunately, in the meantime, we're not recognizing that we lost a huge part of our true productive economy. And what we're doing here, Trump has said, that is we're trying to replace a piece of government spending with private, you know, we're starting to, reshape the pie so that there's more private, more efficient private enterprise economy in less government, but it's a, you know, it's a queen marriage, it's got to turn around.

What's your broader view on commodities? Because you also mentioned oil being positioned where it is, which has been actually really interesting to me. Talk to me about your lens with respect to commodities. Yeah, so my, as you know, my whole big picture of view is that we would have, you know, this last blow off in this cycle's economy where we would have commodities participate in that, have a run up in copper to 6 and probably seeing lots of commodities move up. But then the global bust would hit, mostly centered in next year, but maybe starting this year. And it would take, could take copper all the way down to a dollar even, certainly 2. And could then likewise with aluminum and steel and et cetera. So our starting point going into the next cycle is going to be much lower commodity prices. And I think that's not in most people's forecast. I mean, I think because nobody, not very many, looking for a bust. So I do believe the response to the bust will be this massive fiscal and monetary response to the tune.

I think, and again, all the central banks do the same thing. So I think, you know, you get out a couple of years from the bust and you're looking at rapidly rising commodity prices along with rapidly rising inflation. And it means you could see copper, which let's say against to six this cycle, maybe next cycle gets to 25, you know, with oil is, you know, 60 now. And it goes to 30 in the bust at the beginning of the next decade, I think it can be 500. So you're going to have huge run up in commodity prices, but not straight from here. So you have a couple of years here before people realize that, you know, the reshoring and everything we're doing is ultimately going to. Well, the reason you get the run up in the commodity is because you can have, as you industrialize America again, as we move more to an industrialized economy away from consumer because the consumers go to be flat on the back after the bus.

So you're going to have demand blow up very quickly, meaning in the matter of a few years, capacity to satisfy that demand takes maybe eight or ten years. So you're going to have a period for several years where demand is far outstripping your capacity to satisfy that demand. You know, anything that gives us that is price. So that's why you can get oil going from 30 to 500 or copper going from, you know, 2 to 25. And I'm just throwing numbers out there, obviously. But I think it's going to be unlike anything we've ever seen. One last question before I let you run, obviously the interest there is it would seem that before oil ever got to 500 that there would be either some sort of intervention or some sort of broad change in energy usage, meaning pivoting more to other fuel style. Now, as I think about your idea, what would prevent that is if it happened so fast that none of that could occur quickly enough in order to move. But I'm curious if that's even remotely close to accurate or what your view is there. You'll have lots of substitutions. For example, we're obviously re-jumping our restarting our coal industry. I think you're going to see that play a big role in trying to satisfy some of that because we're",

You won't need to subsidize because it's going to come a time when it's across over where you say, hey, I'd rather have an electric vehicle. Even electric electricity is going to be expensive too, but, you know, there is a point where the market will solve all these things. The problem is the government always thinks they're smarter than everybody else and they want to engineer when things happen. They want to they want to be in charge of when things happen instead of laying the markets to determine that. The funny thing about that is obviously I live in California and the electric car thing really big deal here, right?

Last thing I want to wrap up with is when you look out as things sit right now into 2025, what are the top two or three things that you're keeping an eye on that you think as those things move, indicate progression or a shift in your overall thesis? Yeah, certainly the tariff policy, I want to see that then I'm right that we will at some point in the next month or two see a lot more movement towards negotiation. You know, if China continues to play hardball, we just continue to wrench it up tariffs, you know, then you can crack things and it can be a lot, you know, you certainly have to factor that in. So tariffs won or the whole process of negotiations won and the other one I think is kind of the it's going to really I think in fact exactly when the Fed comes in, not that I need the Fed initially, I mean as I've said, Rachel is going to come down without the Fed.

But we do or not, doesn't really matter to my thesis, but but I think watching jobs and whether that, you know, we start seeing that slowdown more, watching just the overall economic data, because that's where I think, you know, I am very confident that Powell is not watching the stock market. He's not worried about trying to prop up the market, but I think there is a crossover point where if the economy weakens, he can't sit on his hands any longer and say, hey, we're waiting on tariffs, he's going to have to come in. So I'd be watching just general economic data and certainly jobs, because that's what they're focused on. But jobs is a lag, or that's why I, again, the Fed drives me nuts, because they should know better than to use a lagging indicator as their sign of when to move on something that has a long lead time.

Now, the final thing I'm curious about, we've talked about this from the lens of expecting tariffs to be used as negotiation tools. What's your view if that is not the case? Or whatever reason? Let's just say that they end up staying or it just becomes more aggressive. What's your view of how things might progress if that ends up being the scenario instead? Yeah, then it comes down to how fast do things deteriorate? Because I think it is hitting the economy. How fast things deteriorate versus how fast does Powell recognize that he's got to abandon the worry about inflation and focus on the economy? Because I think that's coming. It's just a matter of coming in May, coming in June. Anybody that thinks there's a Powell put or a fed put on the market? He's made it very clear. He's not going to blow up things again, pump up the money again to support the market. But I think that entire F1C board, their whole mandate is, you've got to make sure you don't tank the market.

As much as he and Trump maybe not liking each other, I think he's still a sincere in knowing what his job is, meaning Powell with a sincere in that. I think he's got a pretty good solid group of economists there. Austin Gouldsby is a smart guy that has enough tendency to understand that we can't wait and sit on our hand until we see the heights of the eyes and recession. We've got to act soon. There are at least one that gets that. I think we'll be one of the ones pushing in that direction. He's held off to date. I keep saying, if you judge the fed on the base of the last year, you'd have to give him a high and give him my marks because they brought inflation down without causing a recession. The big question now is going forward. I've been very defensive of Powell, but defending him against a lot of critics, based on what we've done last year. But once criticized him, basically, he was more right than anybody in waiting. What he did last year was, it took some pressure off and it wasn't wrong thing either.

What he did last year was, it took some pressure off and it wasn't wrong thing either. But their rhetoric right now gives you the indication or gives you the impression that they are going to wait a long time before the ease again or that they are not in any hurry to ease. I think we're very close to a time where he should be doing it pretty aggressively. Whether that's May or June, if he thinks it's six months off, he's going to get bad grades going forward. Good grades up till now. The fed always has a history of staying the party too long on the tight side and creating a hard landing when it quit a bit of softening. That's my fear again. Yeah, Bonn rates right now are showing 90 probability of no change in May and then a 71.8 probability of 25 bips in June. As I say, their committee that has made play a mistake over the years, not just this committee, but the fed in general, at the FLC in general. I don't try to predict meeting the meeting what they're going to do. I do say what I think they should do, which is I think they should cut in May. Whether they will or not, I think again, if the economy is where it is today,",

If you see data that changes Paul's view or gets Paul's attention, he'll change between now and May 7th.

And Paul's a human being, yes, he has access to a lot of data, but he's shown that as the Fed always has been, their data dependent and that is really backward looking. So you know, you get some data changes as mine, he'll change his mind. Yeah, makes sense. So you've given us an overview of what's happened since last time. We spoke. You've given us what you're thinking. Things look like going forward over the next year. So is there anything else that you'd like to hit on before we wrap up?

I did that right smack in the middle of the, you know, the sell off, you know, when we were down below 5,000 on the SB, when there were else's lowering numbers, I raised them. My Nasdaq target had been 25,000. I raised that to 27,000. And I am very positive on semis, semis being obviously everybody's turned pretty negative on them and they've been hit hard. I have a 400 target on SMH, which I think it was down 190 or they're about so more than the double from here and people think I'm crazy, but I think once this thing gets going, you're going to see semis lead to pack again. I also raised my target on the three things I raised my target on more than Nasdaq SP and Gold. And I've raised my target from 3,400 to 4,000. So, no change in silver?

So that's pretty big adjustment for Gold. Definitely. Yeah, that's why I thought it was interesting, because I think it gives a little insight into your perception of the relationship between Gold and Silver because of the adjustment in Gold and Silver. Yeah, Gold is recognizing the momentum. If you look at it, if we run from, you know, the low 30s to 75, that's a, you know, more than certainly, well more than a double 120 percent or whatever. Whereas the move from 3,300 to 4,000, you know, is whatever that is, you know, 20, 20, some 1 percent. So, I do expect Silver to very much outpace Gold from here. Now, Silver and Gold, Silver gets a bad unwrap because everybody thinks it's not done anything from the lows of a couple of years ago, you know, from 2022 lows. Gold and Silver until very recently when Gold had this last bird had traded up, had pretty much doubled, almost doubled each from that low. So the perception he has at Silver stood still,",

So the perception he has at Silver stood still, Gold's had a nice run, right? Well, it's part of that because Silver is more volatile and typically does outperform, and not perform yet. It's basically been performing almost in line, but with a lot more volatility. I think from here, you should see Silver really start to be the leader, but Gold will still have obviously some nice run up to 4,000. That leads to one more question, sorry, but the recent drop in Silver, I thought that was very curious compared to what Gold's done over the last couple weeks. What did you make of that move specifically? Unfortunately, I think Silver is obviously more economic, and so it's probably somewhat a statement. Copper dropped from five bucks down to four bucks or whatever. I think the economically sensitive metals got hit harder, and I think there were some of these. They were going to tear off, they didn't end up tear offing Silver, I don't think, but it's just the more volatile metal, and as people risk off, they sold those things that they were most nervous about.

    "text": "didn't end up tear offing Silver, I don't think, but it's just the more volatile metal, and as people risk off, they sold those things that they were most nervous about. That's what, and that's really when you talk about that sell off in the market, and you could easily, and I saw many of the technicians get very negative, and many astragists get very negative because of the breaking of somebody's key levels. But when you really step back and realize that was a lot of force liquidation, margin calls, and such. And the rest of it was basically just plain panic, risk off. I'm getting out because I'm not sure what's happening. This is a crazy policy. We've never seen this before. And because everybody did it in a concentrated way, yeah, he broke some, I think you're going to break them on the upside just as quickly. But you know, that's what I kept saying that whole week that we were just getting hammered. I just said you got to let the dust out. I think that's just panic. I see. Yeah, I follow you there. Well, as always, really, really interesting talking to you, getting caught up on. I lost you. Oh, sorry, I still got you. Can you see me? Yeah, no sound. I think we are back online. But I was just saying it is always, it's really interesting understanding your lens of like what's happened, what you're expecting to see. So thank you",

But I was just saying it is always, it's really interesting understanding your lens of like what's happened, what you're expecting to see. So thank you for taking the time to walk us through that. Now people can still reach out to you on X. I'll make sure to throw your correct link in the notes below for them to check out. They can I assume still DM you for your quarterly newsletter. Is that still accessible to everybody? Once details on the letter, just DM me. Beautiful. And then anything else that you'd like to direct people towards? No, I just think we're in for a heck of a next, you know, between now and the end of summer, I think we're not going to be, you're not going to have a relaxing summer on the beach just way I put it. It could be fun, but I think it's going to have people, people in our business are going to want to stay next to their desk, so next to their computers, I think. So. Yeah. Well, I fully agree with you there. It's been very eventful so far. So fully expect to continue, but thanks again for coming to Hangout and as always, I'm sure we'll connect again in a few months and we'll see how things trend. Yeah, thanks. Great conversation, I",
