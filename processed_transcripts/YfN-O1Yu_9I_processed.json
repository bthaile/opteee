    "text": "zero DTE options blew up in popularity during COVID. And we're starting to see it level off as you take a look here from Goldman Sachs. The overall volume is starting to mellow out. However, what does this mean for us as traders? Well, it means a lot of traders are starting to realize that this gig probably is in for them and gambling their life savings on zero DTE options. Doesn't work super great. But for the more discerning trader, there's some really cool opportunities. Like if you check out this one also from Goldman Sachs. This tells us that the overall pricing discrepancies of a one day straddle compared to the realized move there is some edge. But it's not as dominant in the markets as we're seeing now as it is during more mellow markets. So you might have to be a little more careful with your timing of your trades. Be an otler, see ya later.",
