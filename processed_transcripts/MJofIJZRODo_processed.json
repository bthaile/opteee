So that specific section that it was discussing is that the news finally broke on actual large news station that's GameStop had started to be talking about investing in Bitcoin, right? So you can see that right now it's framed as sources and it's still in the process of figuring out if it's going to, then there is the picture with Sailor. So there was a ton of conjecture about if this was going to happen, but the fact that this moved from being just a picture to now actually hitting newsprint on Friday, this is a big part of that move. So if we go to X and we check out where Cohen, I don't remember the exact day that he posted that. So I'll tell you right now. Every time I just type in Cohen, there's like a million of them. I'm always surprised that I have to like go out of my way to type Ryan Cohen. It's actually kind of frustrated. Is this the right one? I think this is the right one. Is that correct? 444? He was kind of light in terms of followers for him. Anyways, he posted this. So now, one of the things that Cohen does that we can clearly tell is he is cryptic, but he's also very intentional",

He knows that his audience, meaning the people that are going to see this are immediately going to start dissecting it and trying to figure out if there's some sort of hitting message, message, meaning and so on and so forth. So this picture is interesting. Now he's also posted pictures with other people that may or may not have had anything materialized. A lot of people pointed out the picture that he took with icon. So he obviously takes pictures, right? So that is what it is. But I do think that the timing of this is slightly interesting. And I do think that he absolutely has to know how much a lot of the stockholders of GameStop want it to be involved in cryptocurrency. I personally don't really share that position genuinely. I don't see anything inherently wrong with it, but to give you my actual opinion and I'm highlighting that this is an opinion.

Meaning if they're going to pivot it more into this card grading services, who knows there could be a world where maybe there's some sort of exchange offering from GameStop for cryptocurrency. I think that would be a massive leap. I don't personally see it happening, but it could be, right? These are things that could be. So when I'm looking at the company though, I am, I don't want to say frustrated because it's not exactly frustration, but I am kind of like what the fuck is the plan? We've had that cash for a while now. It's over six months, essentially, that we've been sitting on billions in cash. And again, not saying that anything has to be completely, you know, not everything has to be completely quick or ironed out or anything like that. But we've been sitting on the cash for a while. That cash is not doing much for us. And I know a lot of people are really happy to look at the interest, earn on the cash. The interest earn on the cash doesn't really matter. It really",

They need to do something with the money to drive revenue. So I think from that lens, everybody and specifically, again, being very clear of myself very specifically is like, what are we doing with this money? I know there's a plan for it because again, he's a smart dude. He's around a lot of smart dudes. And he is somebody that I know is not just moving haphazardly. So I know there's a plan, but it's still obscure to shareholders. So this kind of thing is also very interesting to me because he knows all of this. He knows that all of the shareholders know that the stock had gone through a couple at the markets. And he knows that a lot of the shareholders know that there is a bunch of cash sitting there. He also knows that the shareholders have no idea what the plan is for the cash.

But this idea, and I've seen this before, like Luke said the same thing. Luke is saying the same thing I've heard before where Luke is saying most people see GME becoming a birchhar, half the way type company, the card grading, Teddy investing in Bitcoin, or all moves GME investors probably like. And I agree that the investors like it. They need to because realistically right now for GameStop any movement is better than the current course for the company. Again, like let's just let's decouple the fact of like what GameStop is, what it represents to people and all of those elements. And like let's just look at it as a company as a company. It has to innovate itself. It has to just like every other company out there has to innovate itself. So I think the fact that GameStop is starting to innovate is massive. The fact that they're getting involved in card grading was huge. I think that's a great first step and it's something that has to happen.

Does that mean that GameStop couldn't do it? I think they could potentially, but that's just a completely different thing. And if that's the direction that they were going to go, the pivot would probably look a lot different than it has so far in my opinion. I don't see how this current structure would lend to that objective very well, but it also could just be a future dated pivot. I think in the near term, the most important thing for GameStop is revenue and sales and keeping the lights on because they're doing a good job going through some cost cutting measures. They're getting rid of their unprofitable stores, which is also very important. So they're definitely conducting this pivot, which is so, so, so needed. Now the thing that we all continue to look at is what is the next move? And one of the things I was thinking about is that just like I understand and acknowledge that it's very clear from a lot of the GameStop base, meaning the shareholders really do want to see Bitcoin on the balance sheet.

So there might be an element where he's like, you know, this is something that they really would like. They've talked about it voraciously all over the place. We can add a little bit of Bitcoin to the balance sheet. Like, and I don't think that would hurt anything. Now if they start turning into like a Bitcoin holding company, again, that's just a completely different direction, which is not to say that it couldn't happen or it couldn't be profitable. It could be which is completely different than what they're doing now. And based on the moves that they're making, if they were to make that shift, the way that they're going about it right now doesn't really seem to make sense to me.

It does have obviously an online footprint, but it's a brick and mortar company. So it needs to do things in order to still survive as such. And the cool part is just because it's a brick and mortar company doesn't mean that things look bleak for it. Look, go drive around. You'll see tons of brick and mortar companies. They're there. They do a lot of different things that other places can't do. Think of if you want to go get a couch, most people don't just buy a couch offline. They go to a store and go sit in the couch.

But it wasn't like this laundry list of potentials that they're looking at, things that they like, how they're view in the company's future, what they envision it, which again, it's just a different management style. But a lot of places aren't quite as reserved with respect to at least talking about vision and what they think something could be because that's not really guaranteeing anything and it's not starting down a specific path. It's just talking about visioning, which is still I think very useful. So overall, really interesting happenings this week. And obviously the market started to react to a lot of this news that we saw where there are now starting to be sources talking about the involvement in Bitcoin, which is very, very interesting.

That says is considering investing in Bitcoin and other cryptos, the shift would make the company more like micro strategy, which I don't even want to get into that. That's the last thing that I think games stop should do personally is go down the path of fucking micro strategy. But I digress, which relies on Bitcoin purchases, a core of its business strategy that might represent a more promising future for GameStop as sales of physical copies of games, Dwindle, which this is completely true, right? Physical sales of games definitely go down, but that doesn't mean that they can't get involved through the broader gaming sphere. It also doesn't mean that they can't get more involved in the PC side of things, right? Like there's a million different perspective directions that GameStop can go. So when you read stuff like this, I just encourage you to not perceive this as GameStop is physical copies of games and therefore they're screwed because physical copies of games are slowing down slash essentially going away.

Still booming, but it's just shifting. And this goes back to that same message I continue to beat the drum of, that they have to shift, they have to pivot. If they don't do that, then they will struggle, but they are starting to do that, which is very promising. Let's see. GameStop buying Bitcoin is a hail marry from a company with no viable business plans as Peter Schiff. Now here's the thing. Peter Schiff, as you all know, he's a personality. So the way he phrases things is very purposeful. It's designed to drive engagement and stuff like that. So again, you kind of have to take it with a grain of salt. But what he's talking about, again, looking at it from an objective perspective, he's not fully wrong.

It could mean that there are pieces moving in the background that we're trying to protect, that we don't want additional injects coming in from information leaking, making whatever is going on behind the curtains more difficult to execute. It's essentially a leap of faith. It's a leap of faith in the management of the company until they start talking about it. That's exactly what it is. If you do not trust Ryan Cohen, then there's no reason to invest in GameStop. I happen to trust him. I think that he's trying to pivot something. And I think that he is pretty strategic in the way that he thinks and he goes about things. So my guess is there's a really good chance. We will hear something about it.

My entire speculation here is that GameStop is continuing to innovate and will continue to innovate. That's a big part of why you race cash is to open that potential. So this is where a lot of this movement came through at the end of the week. And that movement was really interesting because it had been in a very well-defined downward channel. But unfortunately, it's already starting to rally back down towards those lows. So this essentially to redraw some of these lines that you would have seen before, this represents the bottom of this volume node, essentially that it's sitting on.

And until there's more information out about that, it doesn't necessarily seem like we're going to see a big continuation of this uptrend because it's not really based on anything in the near term. This down move looks to be based on institutional unwinding for whatever reasons we want to say. This looks like institutional expansion. And again, is whatever, whatever it might be, whatever the reason might be. But now from here, it's a wait and see. Now I still think without some sort of really strong catalyst, I think the existing price flow is more likely to mirror what we've been seeing. So I'm going to pop the door for Thoroughville quick. All right. I want to pivot over to the DD library. But before I'll do that, I want to see if there's anything that you guys have going on. Shoesbox says, can I show you my charts on GameStop?

So there isn't anything in there. I don't think that is like magic. Personally, if you want to send them to me, I'm happy to look at them, but there really isn't much that I can do with them. The charts are kind of what they are, the prices, whatever the price is, which is this. So interesting. The one thing I still like is that it is holding these volume nodes so much better. So that still leads me to believe that the accepted floor price for it is much higher than it had been previously. Shoesbox says, okay, I just want you to see a different angle. Yeah, you can send them to me again. Yeah, I'm happy to. I don't think that there's much of the way that I look at charts is it is what it is.

So when we look at FTDs, when we look at volume changes, we can see some stuff going on. That's objectionably true. We can absolutely see some stuff going on. But in terms of the predictive capability, it's not there from what I can see. So what I've done is I take what Newton has been collating and I created a copy of this entire sheet so that I can kind of trim it down into stuff that I can actually do data analysis on so that I can take a look and say, okay, on a legit basis here, do I see some sort of commonality when FTDs hit X level? And I've looked at just about every permutation. I've looked at FTDs at specific levels. I've looked at the delta of the FTDs. I looked at both of those conditions.

But I honestly just don't share that sentiment. The dude is smart, but he's honestly not smarter than everybody that's looked at this collectively and not been able to come up with anything. I just don't believe that. I think the main thing is he was in a position that it blended opportunity, luck and skill all at once, which is very frequently how true success happens for people. It's observed time and time again. If you look at the advent of companies like Microsoft and you listen to Bill Gates' origin story, a big reason why Bill Gates was the one that was super successful.

So it started helping him move at a pace that other people literally just didn't have access to. That's not to diminish the work that Bill Gates put into Microsoft. I always will remind just about everybody that if you are successful, a non-trivial portion of your success is due to luck that doesn't diminish the work that goes into place to position you to be able to capture luck when it comes up. Because that's the other thing. When people here luck, they immediately think like, oh, they didn't do anything. They just got lucky. And that's not it at all. Many of people have looks at things that would be considered luck if they were in a place to take advantage of it, but a lot of times they're not. So I look at my life, I look at literally every, a great book on this is called Outliers.

But the interesting thing about luck is the harder you work and the more skills you get, the more lucky you get. Well, we're that in it. A big part of it is positioning yourself to be able to actually capture luck when it's there. So this is very, very much what I think a lot of what we see from the cat. Like we've been analyzing this kind of data for some time now with some element of predictability, but it's not really statistically significant. So there are elements in this that I actually think are way easier from a predictive capacity standpoint. And I've already told you guys all of them because it's really fucking simple expansion of volume.

You don't have to know the timing. That's the cool part about this. A lot of people when I say that they feel like I just killed Sandra Clause and to me it's the opposite.

So if you're actually reading research papers like on SSR and you'll see that a lot in the beginning they'll cite the current state of the topic that's being researched based on all the existing research what they found. And then at the end of all that what they do is they say this now based on all of that other stuff. This is what we're going to look at in this paper and this is what we think is different compared to everything else that I just cited.

I'm just going to read this section to you so from what I'm seeing here so far this looks like they're trying to make sense of these different entities holding the same names and trying to figure out why they would do that. Which is actually pretty simple but I'm curious what they're what their conclusion is and where they're going to go with this. So they're saying let's say I'm an investment company money ink they're competing for investor money with Cartman who owns fat money down the street is Kenny money castle Kenny is short speech impediment steals some of our customers. On the edge of our little town really nice big fat juicy company called hanky poo want to invest in. I really like to buy the stock so I buy 20 of the company until Cartman about it and",

Mine with our ownership gives us a lot of control over what kind of stuff goes on in the company yes. The rest of the town loves it they seem to think that it can scoop up 20 of retail okay. So now they're just showing the different distribution of stock ownerships. Um. Yeah. They have a bit of a fundamental misunderstanding of this yeah essentially yeah.

I don't disagree with them but the problem is it starts to go a little too far down the deep state route and there's a lot of artifacts we can see on the open market of who makes the decisions and what those decisions lead to the incentive for a company is to grow it's to compete for market cap and market share.

So far I'm wondering what the tie in here to game stop is because a big reason why you see this kind of ownership is because there's efficiencies that are gained by doing this think of Berkshire Hathaway this is essentially a Berkshire Hathaway equivalent where you have one company that starts to scoop up controlling holdings in other names and under the same umbrella and that holding company. The holding company actually has some key benefits associated with it so yeah let's continue. So the stock rock is citadel. There are two sides of the same megacorp coin one controls the longs one controls the shorts together they. Control the entire market. I mean they do control a lot of the market I agree with that I think it's a little much to say they control the entire market but I get their point and I actually don't disagree that they do control an overwhelming majority of the market.

So I think that can be cases where you just you you have a friend over at this other place you're in a similar industry and you just trying to help your friend out so I think that it's not even limited to instances just where we see. But even just relationships I think can lead to some of this. All right. What does the ownership of GameStop look like? Okay. There is only one company in the world mega corpse citadel black rock black rock is citadel citadel is a scam when March calls fiscal responsibility between the institutional longs and shorts we own GameStop.

I think this is a delicate answer because I know that there's a lot of mixed opinions and whatnot on what these different institutions and entities want and I think a lot of it has to go back to the idea of whether or not we think that the shorts have closed. Which I've not seen really any decisive evidence one way or the other. But I think I think institutional ownership of a stock is actually really important to its survival because the purpose like let's go back to basics. The purpose of a company offering shares is to take in money to raise capital and then what you choose to do with that capital you raised is obviously your decisions whether you want to invest in the business acquire a new business but you need capital to do these things and that's the point of giving up partial ownership of your company is to be able to do these things. So I think looking at institutional ownership always is like this bad thing again I think it takes the general movement here too far and the reality is institutions manage a lot of money and their involvement in a company a",

So when I see institutions buying something like GameStop to me that mean I'm bullish I like that because institutions aren't in the business of getting into things that they think are going to fail unless they're getting into something with the purpose of trying to make it fail. But that's not really the case in GameStop because we know the CEO is we know who the team is there. So we know that that's not what they're trying to do and it's also important to remember that the number of instances where institutions are getting involved in a company with the intent of trying to make them fail. They're very impactful when it happens but it's a minority of cases not saying it doesn't happen it happens and it happens more than it should not excusing it. But I'm trying to avoid the common analysis.

Now there are some places that specialize in companies going down but still even if you net it all out the most money to be made that exists in the market is by playing the expansion of the economy and the expansion of productivity and overall income of these companies. So I think that there are instances where an opportunity might present itself to institutions to essentially seller box which is complete bullshit do not like that at all I think it's absolutely fucked up. But I don't think those opportunities are necessarily all over the place 24 seven and the only reason why institutions are trying to get involved. I think the majority of the case institutions are getting involved because they're trying to make money and they looking they're looking for things that might provide a decent return on their capital so yeah I don't view it as a bad thing I really don't now I would view it as a bad thing if you start to see the leadership start to get swapped out that would be very bad very very bad.

Market makers having most control over transactions you have to know what they mean by that. Citadel is the largest market maker Citadel is more power than the exchanges do offer more products more ways to purchase them and more venues than the exchanges. Citadel is even started its own exchange in 20 growing rapidly market maker competition is deterred from directly competing with Citadel they have too much influence and competitors are incentivized to coordinate with Citadel not compete. No more market makers have decreased in major exchanges while Citadel's market shares growing. I mean there's a lot to. So just to talk about some of it then we'll flip through it. Having quote unquote more power than the exchanges. It's again another misunderstanding of what it is it doesn't really matter if citadel has quote unquote more power the exchanges essentially do what the exchanges do and Citadel as they're talking about launching its own exchange which definitely was growing rapidly at the time that they were writing this there's still all these other exchanges.

Nine months when MEMX was open, Citadel and Virtue opened their own exchange. Yep. Yeah. So I mean, I think a couple things again here, like being a market maker is competitive, but that doesn't mean that there's not alignment on the back end of deployment or implementation. And exchanges being commoditized, that we know is true. And a big reason why we know that's true is again, look at payment for order flow. As a retail trader, when you submit your orders, your broker bundles a bunch of this order flow and then literally market makers bid to pay to get the order flow bundle so that then they can execute the order flow. They're essentially paying to do their job. What does that tell you? It tells you that their margins are insanely good. And this is for a lot of different reasons because retail traders are typically uninformed trans actors. And that is the ideal case for a market maker to transact in because they can make way more money, way more than just the bit as spread. When market makers are executing informed order flow, they have to be way more cautious. They still make money. But in general, they have to be way more conservative and how much they can make with retail order flow. That is the panacea that is like the",

But in general, they have to be way more conservative and how much they can make with retail order flow. That is the panacea that is like the cure off for all of their problems. If all they could do is take retail order flow that's uninformed all over the place, that's perfect for them. So yeah, definitely commoditized. No doubt. Okay. Another interesting piece. The word is that leave us. The Sun never sets part two. Let's add that leave off Sun never sets part two. Beautiful. Very interesting. All right. So recap for what we learned. We learned about the relationships between BlackRock and the ownership and how a lot of these different companies that have ties and relationships with one another own a lot of the same companies. We learned about the relationship between Citadel and the positioning of Citadel compared to other entities in the same field and essentially the overwhelming competitive advantage that Citadel has in the space. So all in all, I actually really like those two pieces. I think that they're these are good good research pieces. I think so far, we're kind of getting a lot of like refreshers of stuff that we've seen before. But I don't think there's anything wrong with that because a lot of the different things that we see at least have some slightly different",

I think that it's good to see slightly different perspectives, even if it is on very similar content. So I like to. Any questions or anything that you all would like to hit before we wrap up for the evening. Anything we should take a look at. Joseph says a ton of stuff. Business spring solutions to problems that arise high level but maybe over simplified. I don't just agree with that. I think that that's generally the I agree with you. I think in in an overarching sense like that is the point of business is to solution. Potential problems are not even necessarily problems but even things that are in efficiencies. I would call it and to provide different solutions for that and monetize them. So I think that that's a completely fair characterization. You don't have to be sorry. That's completely cool. Sweet. All right, gang. Well, that wraps us up for tonight. As always, if there's anything we should take a look at, let me know. Be an outlier. Be an ape. See y'all later.",
