I'm astonished the market movement over the last nine to ten sessions. We aren't getting rate cuts, tariffs are only paused, not canceled. And it looks like they're buying puts for a three to six months out, maybe even less. The point that I want to make here is if we take a look at price performance over that timeframe. This is the SP 500 over the last six months and you can see the last month or so, it's essentially been going straight up. So if this person did buy puts, they're getting smashed right now. That doesn't mean that their puts wouldn't eventually be vindicated if the market crashes in the next five months based on their timeline. But they would have gone about it a really inefficient way. And this highlights two things. Looking in the industry, it really doesn't mean that you know what's going on any better than other people. It means that you might have more experienced more access information. But you'll see this all the time and it's why from the retail trading lens, you have to be so careful with the standard appeal to authority that people will use. And I'm not saying that that's what this person was doing. They're just saying that I look at this every day and they're surprised. And I don't",

They're just saying that I look at this every day and they're surprised. And I don't blame them. I totally get that. The thing is is you, I find as a trader, if you learn to focus more on what the market is doing and less on what you think it should do, your way, way better off. Because if you see it's going up and you just decide to ride that momentum instead of fighting it because it's incredulous movement. And you think that it's not going to last, then ride it on the way up. And then when it starts flipping and going down with severity, ride it on the way down. By buying puts as it's going up because we just don't think that it should be going up, even though it is, we're stepping in front of the moving train. And even if we start to get that down move that they might be thinking, they have a ways to go to recoup the data that they overpaid for because implied volatility will be high on those puts. And then until they even get back to break even. So I simply try to look at what the market is doing and follow along with it to a degree. As it moves, I",
