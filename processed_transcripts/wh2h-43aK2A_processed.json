    "text": "hey everyone eric here with a fresh haircut finally i hate having long hair so it was time to get it chopped off we have a uh update for small stacks let's jump over the screen and take a look at what we have going on so essentially i structured my initial outlay so what i have is so i have a short put in xlf expiring to october i collected 50 bucks for that and it's 2400 to cash secure the position which as you know i'm cash securing these positions and then i also have a short put in zynga at uh 8 50 so that's collecting 27.85 to cash secure and then what you see at the bottom is a trade that i have not put on yet but i'm expecting to and this is a leap diagonal in ford now in general i'm not a huge fan of ford but the diagonal itself is very appealing to me and i do like the exposure at this level this is what i talk about all the time in terms of just shortfalls of smaller accounts you're forced into certain you know positions and products that i typically wouldn't trade like i wouldn't bother with ford i would trade something like gm or i don't know something that i feel a little more comfortable with in terms of it's standing in the market but i do think that ford is still a strong company i think that they",
