First we're going to talk about well the market Then we're going to talk about Nvidia and GameStop because GameStop just so close not quite and we'll talk about that in a minute But looking at the market really quick as a whole really interesting activity across the board Spy closed at all time highs 603 cues within striking distance, but still lagging and small caps is now also at three month highs Which is really interesting that small caps are now picking up a lot of steam on a three month time frame compared to cues VIX is down super low 13 and a half bonds up a bit Bitcoin also capturing highs it came in MBT it looks like it hit a high today of what 10,000 325 something like that. So overall super super strong performance across the board. So what's going on here? Well it looks like within the market There's a bunch of undertones that we can see and as you look across the different sectors you can see this coming out in HD so we're seeing real estate really capturing a Lot of trend strength here. It's approaching three month highs It's still lagging a little bit, but not all that long ago. It was literally at three month lows So this is a super strong move that we're seeing in real estate and then staples and discretionary that relationship is",

We have XLP is still quite a ways off of three month highs XL Y is at three month highs So kind of just interesting undertones from a tech perspective. Com services is still the leader within tech and you can see XLK is lagging a little bit so Lots to do as per usual with the market. There's a ton to take a look at we'll get to GameStop and just man That's ugly candle, but we'll get to GameStop and just second. Let's take a quick look at Nvidia first and Nvidia's kind of been the talk of the town today and this week for a few different reasons It had okay earnings like there wasn't anything that stood out to me when it reported earnings that looked super soft anything like that It beat EPS it was expected at 0.7 came in at 0.81 and I know that this is a little lagged But you can see that the market definitely started reacting off of that and then we had some other highlights stuff like this where it was Really starting to take shape as some of Trump policies were being",

So We can see here It's this is from Benzinga and it says stock is up Friday and it reports indicating the US government is set to announce further sanctions on exporting semiconductor equipment and AI members chips to China, which will be less Strangent than the previous ones.

It's not going to be super fast In order to get a really well-defined and refined system To produce really quality semiconductors It really the supply chain component it takes time to build that that's why places like Taiwan have Such a strangle hold on it because they've built the infrastructure to get it down to an absolute science and Interestingly enough even something like semiconductors. There's a lot of Pass down knowledge in terms of the production process that isn't necessarily able to just be lifted and shifted super easily Getting the right experience around to do a good job on chips like that is not Simple So let's check out a little bit here.

Meanwhile We literally struggle to manufacture chips without them which is A little bit scary if you think about it So understanding these supply lines is really crucial because there's a lot of really great trade opportunities Specifically and stuff like Nvidia that got beaten down pretty hard here It was at 152 and it fell down into the 130s. That's not a small contraction And that's a decent correction I think and it's something that I really like to the upside long term still You can see where my downside original target was just for a premature exit if needed And now this actually gets a chance to move up Because I think that long term it still looks really strong to me.

It's not crazy, but a 6 down move in a day is nothing to scoff at So I would love to see these moving averages maintain this alignment You can literally see that we just got full MA alignment where it's a short term Above a slightly shorter or longer term above a slightly longer term above the longest term all positive sloping That's all good A lot's going to depend on how Monday looks.

That means whatever price is at the time Even if you don't like it even if you think it's manipulated.

It is what it is So from a trading perspective you have to roll with that from a market structure perspective That's different. I understand a lot of the concerns people have with some of the pricing issues And we've been diving into that on the Saturday live streams where we're going through all of the old DD We have another live stream tomorrow going through GameStop and I can definitely see A lot of the concerns that people have rightfully so But I'm talking two different lenses. There's the trading lens Which is how do we Interface with something to make money as it moves and then there's the structural lens Which is where obviously we're taking a peek at some of the less Upstanding activity going on on the back end which that we don't like to do So let's take a quick look now at the options chain because I saw this pop up Interesting a So we had a few really big transactions today Really big transactions today So if I get rid of this from the week and I just look at today take a look at the size of these top few trades This is a 1.8 million dollar trade and this is a 532 thousand dollar trade those are big trades now We can see that some of these are still further out in time though, right? So these are out",

So these are out in 2025. So these are people playing longer term price moves Now I don't know and I haven't done the research on those forties To see where it's likely that they got in at But my guess is that's out of profit. That's a pretty healthy profit that that person just pulled down And again rightfully so because if We can do a little bit more due diligence on this in the in maybe the live stream tomorrow to see exactly Where we think these guys came in and at in what they're doing But this is looking like a really solid trade just straight profit taking but a 1.82 million dollar trade That's one of the biggest we've seen in some time This is abnormal that popped up on a couple my alerts and same thing with this 500k trade and This one also looks to be profit taking that would be my guess But it's hard to say because It's closer to the ask right so if you look the the spread here's 20 cents They came in you know right dead center. It's I meant to say it's not closer to the ass. Sorry it came in",

It's I meant to say it's not closer to the ass. Sorry it came in dead center so That really means we we don't know where this trade hit in terms of if they're offloading Or getting into my guess would be offloading and that's just because this is a standard place to take profit taking for positional traders like myself So I can totally see the angle here So all eyes on Monday to see if we maintain This kind of range and I think the range is pretty broadly defined at this point We have a little bit of leeway to go around But I'd love to see it hang out in here and then we do know that earnings Is now the 10th confirmed it moved out we could obviously see that in the options chain But they they confirmed it this time So we are coming into earnings soon enough, but we have a little bit more of a standoff distance if we take a look at The What is this one the sixth of December is at 118 percent vol 13 ds is at 140 and then 20 ds drops to 128 So there's still pretty heavy vol in the front definitely around earnings obviously And the transactions today were",
