But then we can also see industrials is starting to pick up steam pretty significantly, comparatively to other things, whereas energy is rolling over information technology, kind of flat on a five day time frame. We got to three months discretionary is just absolutely crushing it, which I don't have a great, I don't have a great grasp on that. Maybe we can actually take a peek in there really quick and see what's doing it. Automobiles and retail. Who would have guessed this? Automobiles is up 58 over three months. But then auto components is down 15. I would expect those to be way more correlated than that. Huh. I don't really get that. I'm sure there's some sort of reason underneath the hood that I just unaware of, but I find that interesting. That crisis components are made in Mexico. Yeah, no, I get the some of the reasons why components. What I'm specifically highlighting here though is how wouldn't that impact? Let's get back into discretionary.

Plus the other component is components made in Mexico. This is for the trailing three months. So I don't I don't actually see that right. We can already see they've been falling down for the whole year. This isn't even like a new thing. Oh, that's so curious. Let's see if we can figure this out. Let's ask, what do you guys want to ask? Do you want to ask? Grock Claude Soner, huge GPT. What's the what's the vibe? Which one do you guys want to take a peek at? Maybe let's take a look at GPT see if this has an answer. So right now automobiles automobiles are up almost 60 over the past three months, but parts is down 15. And you explain the relationship between these and why this is the kick. Do it it says.

The reason why I doubt it is because I'm guessing the overall bulk of auto components would be for the base manufacturer of the vehicle itself, not necessarily the bells and whistles that get added on. So see this makes sense. So in increase in automotive sales. So maybe that's a part of this. So the increase in automotive sales is largely driven by rising inventory levels in deeper discounts from manufacturers and retailers that. As inventories have grown particularly for new vehicles. This is a lot for more aggressive pricing strategies to attract buyers. I don't know if I buy that. Let's see what this thing says. Consumer sentiment reached a three and a half year high retail vehicle sales significant strength. Okay. So sales are up only 11. So that those two explanations don't make sense. Because GPD is saying that we're seeing sales or we're seeing growth in pricing strategies. But sales is only up 11. So if we're only increasing sales 11. But we're doing it on more accommodating pricing strategies. I don't see. I don't see that. Interesting.

You tell me what I'm smiling about and what we just identified. And why this is useful information for you. There's absolutely tradable data from what we just looked at and uncovered. And it's also comical to me. Exactly. So Zachariah recent lands all of the correct takeaways. Tesla. Tesla is. Entirely was propping up that entire sector. And. Let's take a look at GM. GM is doing fine. They're up from. They started three month time frame from 49 and they're at 55. So they're up about 10 decent move. And. I think more importantly though, the reason why we see this broad skew in performance. This right here is literally from Tesla. It's all from Tesla. So that tells us a few things that tells me that the overall automobile sector is still struggling massively. And it tells me that the entire sector itself is not poised to necessarily crush it right now. Since it's being singularly propped up.

That is also informative to trade something to the upside. It means that Tesla, even though the rest of the industry, the rest of the sector is struggling Tesla is not. So again, you can come up with different kind of trades ideas based on that. So. Overall though, I find it, I do find it interesting that there's that big of a disparity. Obviously Tesla has its own supply chains and stuff and this also feeds into some earlier news. I don't know if you guys saw, but I think California hold on. Let me find the news. No. So apparently some high school grads had a crash in a cyber truck. But that's not what I'm looking at. I'm looking for this. We can get rid of this, get rid of this.

It's not set. Doesn't have to be any of these specifically. But those are the choices. We have right now. Let me know if any of those speaks to you. And then we'll pick what we pick what we want to do. But recess futures. That's classic. But this is options trading for beginners. So we're not going to do futures in this one. But good, good idea. But let's let's go here. So this says recent reports have revealed that California governor Gavin Newsom is pondering the creation of a new EV incentive for car buyers in the state. If president elect Donald Trump eliminates the federal tax credit for electric cars, there's only one caveat. The CIA governor's proposal excludes Tesla. How classic is that? Tesla, which I think, yeah, this right here. Tesla makes over 550,000 vehicles in Fremont. In this dude's district and has over 20,000 employees. So it's like this, this news, though, is really important. And the reason why this news is important is because this is now something that can be monitored. And if there's a change or an update to this news picture, you can maybe surmise that there could be an impact a Tesla. If the federal tax credit for electric cars goes",

If the federal tax credit for electric cars goes away, that's not good for Tesla. And then if California state for whatever reason chooses not to include Tesla in that, probably a tradable event mostly on the news. So this is something taking it all the way back to how do we analyze markets and information that's being released in different news postings, looking in the charts, looking at comparative performance to drill it all the way back to practical application and actually tradable information. This becomes tradable information potentially. It doesn't mean that it's going to be, but classic. Absolutely classic. James says that finally went over the two TA videos. Okay, cool. So it looks like you guys took a look at the TA videos. That's great. We can maybe talk about that one then I like that. That's actually a great topic too for this one is like integrating technical analysis with options trading, which I love that. We can do this one here. This can be technical analysis overview. For options trading. I like this one. Great call. And then this will be 29 know. Beautiful. So that will be our focus topic. Mr. I go to says do you ever short if so ratio,",

I trade stuff to pretty much any direction as long as there's a clearly defined direction. And the way that I'll trade things to the downside is either with short calls or via long puts slash long puts short put combination is a diagonal combination there of. I favor short calls typically. And one of the reasons why favor short calls is markets unless we're in like a very clearly defined aggressive down move. Then long puts is fine. But a lot of times I'm not necessarily playing like really big down moves. I'm playing smaller retracements and markets tend to have bullish drift. So you you're fighting against the trend generally from the onset of that position. So yeah, I normally will use short calls for like general shorting of smaller ideas if something's a little bit more aggressive. It would just be long puts and if it's a longer term short idea like for example when we had the bear market in what was it 22. Running long puts there and trading a ratio put diagonal around it was gold it worked really really well. And this month actually I",

But if I eyeball it ratio put diagonals for this year they constitute 9 of my total return. So it's really it's the third fourth I guess the fourth most short wall is about 7 of total performance speculative coverage triangle on zero DTE. These are tied at five and then ratio called diagonals 26. So most of the speculative percent return is from bullish trades and ratio called diagonals. I guess technically the second best is ratio put diagonals but it's just so far apart right 26 versus nine. So yeah the speculative return on the accounts so far this year has been really, really strong super, super strong which I love to see. But even the this is one of those magical years where the yeah this is one of those magical years where the return that I'm getting from core allocation is also really, really strong which is is I think good news but I think trading to the downside on most years is a little bit more challenging of a prospect and that's literally just a function of markets tend to",

Okay we could do 75 that's good so we're looking at names that are within 5 of 52 week lows just to eyeball how they how they've moved. Let's find. Like this. So a big part of the move that you see in laser recently which is a great down move by the way. But this is through earnings.

So when we're trading things to the downside one of the things that you have to really pay very close attention to is velocity. You have to time timing becomes really really really important because you can trade something to the downside from here and get stopped out because it doesn't go that much and that can happen a bunch. I get stopped out on my directional downside trades way more frequently than I do on my bullish directional trades. And again it's because even if you look at this down move this down move happen from here to here. That's like a four day down move it then consolidated trickle down a little bit more in here. And then it but it consolidated here and then it had its next leg down again through earnings. But this is another what five days. So you catch another five day downside move. Then it runs sideways actually consolidates up a little bit and then when it's time for the next leg down it's what another six days. So what I'm highlighting very frequently that you'll find with down moves is that they will look a lot like this where there will be a leg consolidation. Maybe another leg maybe not that's up for debate. But the down move itself the real tradable part",

    "text": "what another six days. So what I'm highlighting very frequently that you'll find with down moves is that they will look a lot like this where there will be a leg consolidation. Maybe another leg maybe not that's up for debate. But the down move itself the real tradable part is generally fast. So let's take a look at crowd strike which is this was on the news that crowd strike their systems failed and like five percent of occurrences. It was like a really really small bit of news but it's still crushed to the downside but take a look. It's kind of trending news breaks you get one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen days to the bottom tech. Three trading weeks to the bottom tech. So one of the big differences when you're trading things to the downside versus the upside is you've got to be fast. Because if you're timing is off even on something like this that had a move from three seventy five down to two hundred a massive down move. So if you're not quick to the jump and let's say that like I did you don't get in until here. Well then all of a sudden. You only catch half of the perspective move. You still get a decent amount of it but if you're not quick to the draw this is when I ended up getting in because this was the day I wanted",

You still get a decent amount of it but if you're not quick to the draw this is when I ended up getting in because this was the day I wanted to see if it was going to catch a bite here and go back up. So I missed essentially from three seventy five down to two to ninety five. Big big big part of that move that I completely missed and then I ran it from two seventy five and then I got stopped out here on this day on this six. For like the bulk of the position. So I essentially only took a ride from two seventy five down to two twenty five maybe it was right above this support line so it was like two twenty five to twenty six. Good move right there there's nothing wrong with that good trade but it's to show you the the tricky part about trading things to the downside even really big companies. And notice how a lot of times when we look at the downside of stocks it's something that's doing it it's something in this case that news broke that did whatever if I go back through whatever that what we were just looking at was a laser. I don't even know what this is but if we go through laser I guarantee you if we go back",

Down beyond the earnings release that really plummeted it from here to here so that's another really big difference between trading downside and upside downside normally is going to have a very specific reason upside it's a lot more nebulous. Because always remember to the upside were just discounting future cash flow expectations so that's going to be your primary driver to the upside you know in conjunction with the rest of the stuff you typically would look at so. James says does market exhibiting upwards shift taken to account survival bias. Explain a little bit more. And I assume you mean survivorship bias but you mean in terms of like what's captured in the market. Because if so that's absolutely correct but the market depending on what we call the market will include those data points still so what that means is for those that don't know.

What this means is and what James is highlighting is is this showing positive drift because we're only watching the companies that are succeeding and are remaining in the index. However what ends up happening is if a company falls to a certain level market cap performance s and p 500 will kick them out. So then what that means is a land says there's only 486 at the moment so what that means is a bunch of companies got kicked out or whatever reason. But it's not exhibiting survivorship bias because the companies that got kicked out",

Which is we all know s and p 500 has massive concentration issues so but that's another conversation what I mean by that is if we take a look at spy and we go in here to think this yeah so you can see the IT is literally 31 if you take a look at like the broad buckets of these is a lot of the benefits of these it's just non it's not even close the top 20 holdings make up almost 50 of this so that's again a whole other conversation this is 504 by the way. So is it I'm used to seeing like 504 486 was interesting to me how many companies are in the s and p 500 index right now.

And he did it on purpose see that's the part that my mind will add on top of it you did it on purpose even though you really neutrally framed it as I think there's only 486 right you didn't even say there's only 46 you said I think but my mind is reading that is lance purposefully deceived Eric. And now any time lance is telling Eric something it's going to be based on pure deceit deception embellish and can never be trusted again that's that's essentially how how this goes from from now on forever. Now what's interesting here though which I didn't know actually is that s and p 500 trust is in boss and Massachusetts did not know that was out of Boston it's interesting.

So I think that you think I see so there's three data points that hit my mind in this conversation the first data point is exactly what I said that I'm typically used to seeing 503 504 the second data point which I threw my data point away and I said that's old data it's wrong I'm going to trust lance because lance has my best intentions at heart he's not going to he's not going to mislead me and then I saw this. Curious this is more used this is what I'm more used to seeing this right here this thing right here that says 504 so then I was like maybe this would be crazy because I know lance wouldn't do this but maybe lance said I'm just going to fucking lie to this dude's face and I'm going to tell him 486 and I know it's more than 46 so I'm going to do this willingly. So then I was like let me corroborate what I'm used to seeing what I see",

So then I was like let me corroborate what I'm used to seeing what I see in toss against a third metric so I have to be honest Zachariah I am going to trust those three data points versus the one data point of lance lying to me unbelievable lance how could you do this to me I really thought that we had a good reliance on the game. So this is a relationship mutual understanding enjoy the conversations together unbelievable. Viper in the discord is showing the SP 500 range for today gainers 289 losers 194 total 486 what's the problem with that from a sampling perspective what's the problem there. Any guesses joking aside it's actually a good lesson. What do you guys think. Some were flat there you go that's exactly it so that's tracking advances into climbing issues that's not tracking everything so you will have a number of issues that are unchanged for whatever they're reporting whatever the reporting metric is. Any curiosity though let's let's look I am genuinely curious now to double check this. I'm going to check this. 503. So that's now a fourth data point from bar chart I was actually genuinely going to be really surprised if it was below 500 because to me that would",

So that's now a fourth data point from bar chart I was actually genuinely going to be really surprised if it was below 500 because to me that would be a big weakness in the index technically. But I and I always thought it was like really interesting that the SP 500 is like five in a few it's not five I don't know why like why does it have to be 503 why can't it literally just be five fucking hundred. But no other weird thing I've always like that again you can tell even before we looked it up I told you guys that I'm used to seeing it around 503 504 because this is one of those weird fucking data points that I do look at. Strange but it is what it is. Zachary says okay so you're seeing confirmed data because I'm not that quick did you say. Yeah I just gave you four data points. But yeah anyways that is I don't know land says all that makes sense I've seen it save 46 on there for a while though if it says it on there for a while I don't honestly know what they're tracking but anyways a good line.

Yeah Daniel says I think there's 500 but some companies like Google and Berkshire Hathaway have more than one ticker. Yeah well and how is that treated. That's Wikipedia let's see what Wikipedia says. Just curious. I think yes so there's two googs so that removes one and then you said Burke. There's only one Berkshire. I see Burke B I don't see Burke a. So what are the other duplicates definitely goog. Let me see what companies in the SP 500 have duplicate. Pickers in the index. So what it should be three. Kind of a completely random but very interesting. Again this is one of those things that like on a Friday night after Thanksgiving do I love this shit I don't know why I just fucking love this shit. It's so interesting to me. What's not interesting though is why this is taking so long to answer of why is it programming stop programming.

So it's only alpha bet. And so far that's corroborated with what we see is the only one I've seen so far that's duplicate. So then there's actually 502. Oh, here we go. Box. So that's two. I guess there's an easy way to look for this now that I see the. And there's news. So there's this three. Boom boom boom. So it is a Dan was spot on it is 500.

Black mom says broken wing butterfly for credit, targeting 610. Okay. So. Oh, that's interesting. I like that. I like that. It's a little bit different. It's definitely not standard for what I would do. Black mom, can you build the trade like actually show, show me what expressions, what legs and then I'll build it in here just so that we could take a look at it together. I'm curious. I'm curious what expressions you would target and why. And all build what I would do.

So like some of you, I would be a little bit pensive that the SP 500 here is definitely hanging near all time highs. But the market tends to spend more time near all time highs. So being afraid with something that's up this high would just keep you out of a trade. Now, the caveat is I wouldn't want to go super heavy right up front. And we have to expect a bit of a pullback to some degree. So I would want to include that into my broader plan. So let me grab this. Let me grab trading view because trading view has that tool that I like. And let's go to spy. And we'll give it to this. So what I want to do is use this fun little tool and look at a few things. So that's a 2.65 drawdown. I don't like to you have to click it again each time. Also, is there a way to get rid of the little title box thing like toggle that or something. That's a 3 drawdown. That's a 1.5 drawdown. This one's a 4.23 drawdown. That one's a 7 drawdown. So what I'm doing here is I'm trying to give myself some historic reference for how I can choose how much room I'm going to get. This thing to move since it's at all time highs. So by doing this, I can",

Well, I guess it's even more technically if we grab it from here. What is it from here? 10 almost. So the reason why I do this is because then I'm going to say, well, what kind of draw it like drawdown in my comfortable experiencing before I would want to get out of it. And even something like this that's on a 10 drawdown, I actually don't fully hate that. But what I do need to see is when has it last rolled over and gotten really ugly for a long time. So something like this. So this went from here to here, which is only a 10.87 longer duration. And then from here, this is. I can't really see. So I'm just going to guess 20 there.

And prices below this slightly longer term or this is 180 day moving average. And then this what's this one the 50 price drops below the 50. Never really got above the 200 from its broader drop here to here. So it fell below the 200 in here. So what was the distance between current price and 200 7. What's the current price is there a way to clear all these drawings at once. I realize I'm making a giant mess. When you guys. I assume I'll be able to tell me how to do this. What's the distance here. 9.6. So what that tells me is I'm going to have to leave about 10 room. In the trade. Because I'm going to use in this case the 180 day MA for drawdown.

So there's a 64 probability that buying shares would make more than the short puts. That's where they become equal. So it's a little better than half which I'm actually okay with. So I would take the short puts. And let's say that we're working up to a total of 500 shares of spy. I'm just picking a number here again for the exercise. To answer this, this would start with two. I would start with two. Of these slightly in the monies. And then I would probably add another one. Of something out here. Like this. And I would run it. See how it does. Because what I do know sooner or later there will be a pullback of sorts. And we have to eyeball how it does next week and whatnot. But buying it at the very, very top tick can be slightly costly. Again, I don't actually think it matters quite that much because a top tick becomes the path to an increase rise over time.

Tommy says how to decide between ratio called the annual coverage strangle for a year plus thesis. And they're completely different profit mechanisms. And the way that those trades make money is completely differently. So I would suggest that the answer lies in the structural differences of the strategies. The way that they do things is different. So for example, one of the reasons why I prefer selling puts in something like spy. Is because I know that there's risk premium in spy right now, but I also know it's typically there. And it's because the indices themselves tend to have more risk premium because people tend to use them for hedging activities. So I want something normally that includes some sort of short put component to build in that structural alpha that exists. That doesn't mean that somebody couldn't trade a ratio called diagonal. It's completely fine. But the way that a ratio called diagonal behaves is that is leveraged upside. So if that's the preference to get just leveraged upside cool, that's 100 fine.

And again, once you build your bearish trade, throw it into the chat. I'll take a look at it with you. And then we will I'll show you what I would do in here. Re says that makes sense as soon as you said it. But I thought there would be less edge and something like spy, but that's why it has VR people, hege. That's exactly correct. That's why people will willingly overpay for protection and something like spy or SPX because it's convenient. There's a convenient factor to being able to use one thing to hedge an entire portfolio. So the risk premiums and that's actually why I showed you guys what was it yesterday that day before where we were looking at. Not yesterday day before yesterday where we're looking at the portfolio in the coverage triangles. And I'm actually running a test right now, a live test comparing the variance risk premium on a volatility adjusted basis in SSO compared to spy. Because I want to see how that translates into less liquid leveraged ETFs because my expectation is that spy will actually have better risk premiums on a volatility adjusted basis. But it is early to say. So let's start analyzing. Voliay, Vali, Vail. What do you guys call this one veil or volley? Vali would have two else",

Yeah, it's in Brazil. So I don't think it would be veil. I think they would call it volley. Valle. Now that would be two else as well. I don't know what they would call this. Huh. I'm unsure. Okay. So let's get to work. I'm going to start my analysis while you guys are finishing up. Throwing in your ideas. Re says in Brazil, they're just add some J sounds. Yeah, Portuguese is tricky. Black Mamba is going 1220, the 20th of the D's buying a 600 call. Selling three six 10 calls. Oh, another butterfly. Oh, is this from before or is this now I think yeah, that must be obviously it's not this. That's from before. Okay, sorry. We're on, we're on Valle now. But let's take a look at some of these moves. This is this is like 10. Take a look at it all time. Okay. And here. All right. So this to me looks like next leg down. Lands us somewhere in this zone. Somewhere around there 829 to 769.

Yeah, so this looks like overall pressure. So I actually. Tommy says sell 17. Jan 9 calls. Okay. James says long put 21 March 25 in the money 11 strike, maybe eventually your RPD of momentum doesn't go fast enough soft exit 1027. That's a good trade outline James, by the way. I like that outline a lot because you're giving kind of important details. Yeah, for me, I would probably. Let's see. So I'm doing is I'm eyeballing some of the previous moves to get a sense of how it rallies on these down moves. So what I'm looking at is I'm seeing. After the after it drops like we typically were talking about faster drop on the way down super common. Consolidates consolidates consolidates rallies a bit then rolls back over. So the idea for a longer term fade here is that you have to be able to withstand these rallies until it resumes the downtrend. So if we zoom this out more. We have to go even more.

This would be really annoying to have to trade this, but let's just model it anyways. And. Let's take a look at. This. I'm going to say 1112. Or 1112. Yeah. So let's hear. So 100,000 portfolio risking about half a percent, something like that on this. So here. Lauren says, I'm listening. Lauren, you can't be fucking hiding from me like that. Where's your bearish trade, Lauren. So here. What do we need? We need like 10 of these. At 11 here, it's like 469. So really, really conservative drawdown. Maybe even one more. Yeah. So something like that 550 bucks. We have the potential to make a whopping 110. Now, let's see a couple other things for comparison. To be clear, I don't love that trade. It's just there's just not enough in it. So then comparatively, we can go to 21 March. Get in for like 70. So what's our loss at 1112. 44 bucks. So again, we can do like 10 of these.

So before I start running my mouth and talking about random stuff. I actually want to start by asking you. What elements of technical analysis. Are you curious about or are you hung up on either or. And while you're explaining that or talking about that. I will start outlining some really, really high level concepts. About technical analysis. And I think I might actually have some notes in here. Let me see. Andy Dandy ugly. I don't actually have to build a slide in here for that. Did you just have this. So. At a really high level. Technical analysis is essentially psychology. Like that's pretty much it. The reason why technical analysis amounts to psychology is because you're seeing the real time pricing of assets in a consensus driven model. So there are two. Really important inputs with technical analysis. In general. The two most important inputs unequivocally. Do you know what those two most important inputs are with respect to technical analysis not even an option is trading yet. But in trading",

Do you know what those two most important inputs are with respect to technical analysis not even an option is trading yet. But in trading in general. So it says psychology of big banks not persons are in my wrong it's everything. Yeah, it's not just big banks. That's the thing is it's a consensus driven marketplace. And for example, I've there are plenty of things that you may be trading that a big bank is not trading. So I wouldn't personally bucket it that way mentally. It's not just big banks. Now to your broader point. And to Tommy's point. Tommy is answering the question I asked before and James is also correct, which is price and volume. That's literally all that matters in technical analysis is price and volume. The reason why the only thing that matters is price and volume is because that is where people are actually putting their money. They're not talking about it. They're not drawing lines. They're not waiting to see what happens. Price and volume is what people are doing. So whenever we're looking at technical analysis, those two components are king. It's the only thing that matters. Everything else that we put on a chart is designed to help us understand and interpret price and volume. That's it. That's home base. So always remember that, especially",

So always remember that, especially as you start getting into exploring more esoteric indicators. That's fine. You can tinker with whatever you'd like. But always remember that price and volume is ultimately what matter. This is also the problem a lot of traders have when they do their analysis, whatever their analysis is. And then the underlying starts doing something different. It doesn't do what their analysis says it's supposed to do or whatever version of that there is. And it's always a great reminder that the market doesn't care what you want to happen. The market isn't out to get you. The market is just purely indifferent to you. It doesn't give a fuck about you. But it's not malicious towards you. It's just indifferent. So when we look at a chart, we're visualizing the behavior of market participants. That's the way to look at this. You're visualizing how groups of people are using their money to speculate. So one of the things you'll notice is that we can learn a lot from just the way candles look by themselves.

One of the things I can tell you about Valiant just from looking at it is that this is generally volatile. Right. I'm seeing a lot of these big gaps that pop. I'm seeing a lot of these bigger candle bodies. I'm seeing these long wicks. I'm seeing steeper trends. I'm seeing moving averages that are kind of all over the place. Comparatively, let's take a look at something like GE. Notice the difference. It still has gaps. It still has moves. But it's way more orderly. So the first thing I'm picking up is just a general temperature of whatever it is that I'm looking at. And I want to understand how does it move? What are some of the behaviors? What are people doing in this specific thing? Why is always nice to know, but it's not a requirement. So that's the level setting. Now, a couple general guidelines that are always important when looking at technical analysis. The first one is price and volume. That's the first most important thing. The second thing is it is okay and important to use different time frames, but you have to tailor what you're doing to the time frame that's relevant to you. The third thing is that you also have to use indicators that are relevant to what",

It's because something like I think this one is a 150. The 150 moving average is really great long term context for me. If I'm trading something intraday, this doesn't really matter that much. Maybe if I'm trading something intraday, I actually prefer VWOPs. None of these are VWOPs because I don't need them here. But intraday stuff, I actually care a lot about volume weighted average price. So that's the third thing is you have to tailor your toolkit to the actual job that you have. And the job is going to be different based on what you're doing. So that's just kind of like some really general high level thoughts that we can go back and forth.

Reese says not sure how to check robustness using a five day MA to confirm up and down for shorter durations, but not sure our robust that is. Well, it depends on what that means. But robustness test on something like that would be how accurate are you with when you use it. And to check how robust you are would be how accurate you are in different things in different tickers and different names. That's how you would determine if whatever you're using is functionally robust enough. So you can either use a broad data set to analyze that or. You can use an eyeball test and go through and say I'm using a this is a 10 day, but pretend it was a five day. And you can go through different things and just see what you here's your five days. So if this is going to keep going up or not. And we would log it. We would say as of 29 November, GE is at 182. I think based on the five day moving average, which was negative sloping is now positive sloping. Again, it's a 10 day. I'm just calling it a five for the example.",

A really important element that I talk about when using technical analysis, especially from those videos. James says, do you mean like you understand how do you understand the TA that Eric spoke about individually? If it want to be able to apply them together as a system. Yeah. So. If if you take a look at those videos, you'll notice a term that I use a lot with is the breadth of evidence. What I mean by that is let's say we're looking at different. We're looking at really anything. So GE will look at GE. And let's say that I'm trying to figure out a trade in GE. I'm not just going to look at the fact that the 10 day is actually inverted below other moving averages. It recently crossed back above the 20, but it's still below the 50. That's one data point.

When the 10 is above the other moving averages that tells me we're more bullish. Let's one data point. The next data point I might look at is the width between moving averages. That tells me are we in a sustained defined trend like you see with the distance between these. Or are we in either a consolidation or a reversal period? That's when you see moving averages start kind of getting all snarled and messed up with one another. So that's another data point that we can see. So what I do is I look at each data point individually. And then I literally bring them all together to determine what does the breadth of evidence tell me. So for something like GE, I see again 10 below 50, but then I see 10 above 20. I see 10 above 150. And I see all these other moving averages are positive sloping except the 50, which is still overweighted based on this move here. I also see stair step patterns. I see a consolidation phase here.

    "text": "above 150. And I see all these other moving averages are positive sloping except the 50, which is still overweighted based on this move here. I also see stair step patterns. I see a consolidation phase here. And then I see a higher low of run all the way up of retracement back down. But the retracement back down is to a higher low. I see a run up a retracement back down. That's also to a higher low. And then I see another move up. This could be followed by another consolidation period. If the consolidation period start getting too congested, that starts to mean that it's probably likely to have a larger role over soon. So the way that you build the repertoire of understanding all the different tools that you use is by throwing them on the chart. And then very meaningfully looking at each one individually. But then also taking all of them together and waiting them appropriately based on the timeframe that you're looking at. One of the biggest issues I see people have with technical analysis is that they spend a lot of time looking at the charts, but they're not really looking at anything. They're just kind of staring at stuff. And you have to be like an active viewer. That means that as I'm looking at it, I'm not just looking at what things look like and picking up random stuff here and there. What I'm trying to do is look at",

That means that as I'm looking at it, I'm not just looking at what things look like and picking up random stuff here and there. What I'm trying to do is look at each data point by itself and then combine them into something that's meaningful to me. Now that process is as personal as it gets. The process of applying technical analysis is so individualistic. It's almost like an art form. Now one of the things I can unequivocally tell you though is that if you keep it simple upfront, it's, you're just going to be light years better off. So what I mean by keeping it simple is that don't try to outthink yourself. If I see GE look like this, it looks bullish to me. Does it again, 10 below the 50s that super bullish no, but everything else on the chart generally looks bullish to me. So you can look at the individual data points and then pull them together using the general consensus of what you see. And the last thing I'll end on here with this specific topic is with technical analysis. Well, two things. One, you're really building up your subconscious processing. So your brain has a tremendous ability to manage an absolute tremendous amount of data. And there's books about a book called Blink is a really, really great book about it. But the Cliff",

So your brain has a tremendous ability to manage an absolute tremendous amount of data. And there's books about a book called Blink is a really, really great book about it. But the Cliff notes version is that while you're actively looking at stuff, your brain is building a massive archive that you can just start seeing things really quickly. And that comes through pattern recognition and looking at stuff. Sometimes it's stuff that you're actively identifying and drawing out. Other times it's stuff that you're kind of just passively picking up, maybe even subconsciously entirely that can happen. Now the second thing that I was going to mention is when you're developing your approach to technical analysis, I would be really, really methodical in what you're looking at. And what it does for you. So for example, I don't have much duplication going on on the chart at all. So the biggest duplication I have are multiple moving averages. And that's essentially what a moving average converges divergence indicator is. It's literally a histogram version of this. I prefer the lines on the chart. So each piece that I'm putting on the chart has a very specific purpose. Things like moving averages help us define momentum. Things like standard deviation channels linear regression channels help us assess overall trend relative to a timeframe and also move severity. Things like volume profile tell me",

So what that means is that's why I have all these relative volume indicators here and then volume moving averages. And then buy and sell percentages. It's all relative volume level data because again, price and volume. Seeing how many people are sponsoring a move is super important. All the volatility stuff you guys are familiar with that well enough by now. This is just a way for me to visualize different levels of volatility. And then I have one single oscillator, which right now I'm using a two line RSI with a seven day VWAP moving average. That's everything that's on here. Now at the top, this are these are different tools to help me quantify movements quickly without having to do math. So like this block here three months, six months, 12 months, percent of one year move. These are just showing me percent moves over these relative time frames.
