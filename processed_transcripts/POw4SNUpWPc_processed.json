    "text": "heavy 12 million puts compared to 6.2 million calls why is that well it's because a lot of entities will use spy or SPX to hedge a broad basket of stock stocks because there's a lot of things in the SP 500 Index they might have individual Holdings in individual companies and then they'll come in here and they'll use this to hedge the whole portfolio why does that matter because the context matters a lot because if you look at this outright you might say wow the they're expecting a market crash that's why there's so many excess puts compared to calls but it's not so much the case you'll typically see it like this now you can track the actual ratio and when that starts to move then it becomes a little more interesting so one puts to calls from tracking this I can tell you it's not that excessive but if we see something one 5 to one puts to calls that's people really ramping up downside protection for some reason or another so these are three of my absolute favorite options analysis tools let me know if you'd like to see a part two because this is the tip of the iceberg we can go way deeper in deta and I would also love to know if you learn something in this that's of genuine interest to me so let me know be an outlier I'll see youall later",
