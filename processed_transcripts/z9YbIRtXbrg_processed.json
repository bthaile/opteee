    "text": "boom we're back at it today I want to talk to you about zero DTE option structures and which one is the best there are a lot of different ways you can trade these things and you might not even know why we trade these things so the goal of the video is to briefly overview why we trade them and then I'm going to walk you through 5 years of back tested results of trading different zero DTE structures with different rules applied to them so that you can start to understand what performs best and what market conditions and then going forward if you guys are interested I can make a couple follow on videos that dive really deep into detail on the top performers so if you watch to the end and drop in the comments what your preferred strategy is for me to take a look at might be able to throw it in the next video for you so what's up everybody Eric here welcome back to all the outliers and a shout out to the patreon family you guys make content like this possible and pay my editor so he thanks you as well thank you let's get into details so what's the premise of these zero DTE strategies now for most people it's probably because they think they're going to get rich quick which is arguably probably the worst possible reason to start trading these for a lot of different reasons if you",
