    "text": "Google's parent company alphabet announced that they're going to be doing a 20 to 1 stock split. So all this means is if you had one share, you will now have 20 shares, but it will be 120th the price. So right now Google's trading around 20,700 bucks. It will be trading closer to like 138 somewhere in there. So the whole purpose of this is companies that have stock prices that get really high. Sometimes they try to make it more accessible to other investors because they buy one share, 2700. It's expensive. So they make it easier for people to gain exposure. You don't see it quite as much with fractional shares, which I hate because it's essentially made up by the broker. You don't actually own the shares. You only have right via the broker stuff like that, but that's another story. Now if you have options, be careful. liquidity is going to go away as the issue, new options change, but they're going to do the same exact process called being made whole. So that's it. Not too bad.",
