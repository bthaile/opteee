    "text": "What up, outliers? Quick market outlook for the week ahead. We had a bit of an interesting week last week. We obviously saw the Fed cut rates. There's a lot of speculation now. What that means for the markets going forward. There's people like myself that are still kind of not convinced that we're in the land of soft landing. There are other people that think we've nailed it and we're good. Only time will tell. So I just want to take a quick look of the market broadly. What's coming up this week. And that will essentially hopefully set us all up for a solid week. Because there's a couple things. So first off, I still am seeing obviously relative strength within large caps. The other thing I'm seeing is that even the cues are starting to rally. There's still like 20 points off off of highs. And then if we take a look at small caps, small caps have now taken down to seven points off of highs. So what that tells me is tech still is not really that strong. And then that tells me when I'm looking at the performance of the SP 500, it's not it's not primarily coming from technology. It's coming from these other sectors. It's coming from XLU. It's coming from XLF, which is now just back up essentially at all time highs. We'll see how that goes. It's coming from XLC. It's coming from XLB. It's coming from XLI. So this",

We'll see how that goes. It's coming from XLC. It's coming from XLB. It's coming from XLI. So this is one of those really interesting scenarios where for so long technology was really dragging everything up with it. And it's kind of the inverse. It's the rest of the sector or the rest of the index via all these different sectors is what's really dragging spy up. It's not being fueled by tech. And again, this is just not super common. So when I'm looking for opportunities, it's really interesting. I'm still finding a lot of really interesting things in utilities for sure. And which I don't think most people thought that that's where we would be looking right now. But that is what we're still continuing to see some level of strength. The other thing is looking at a market perspective this coming week. We have a few things coming up. So when I look at the 23rd, main thing are going to be services in manufacturing PMI. Then the 24th consumer confidence. I'm actually not that jazzed about it. Meaning I don't think it's going to be a big deal. But I do think it's going to be an important read because what I can tell you right now is if we take a look at Fred,",

But I do think it's going to be an important read because what I can tell you right now is if we take a look at Fred, there are a few things going on. So the first thing is if we take a look at the link. We're right. I can see a few very clear trends. The first one is the link. We rates on credit cards are still going up. I can also see that consumer loan charge offs is also going up. So I don't like seeing all these different debt instruments from a consumer perspective increasing. And I also can see that personal savings is actually contracting, which I don't love. So a big part of this is understanding, you know, what the new norm is, what the new paradigm is. But what I can tell you is it's not like the consumer is in this fantastic position. Now I still fully expect to see things in like real estate showing strength because as rates come down, the real estate market is likely going to become a little bit more active. But I'm not sure that the consumer is in this rock solid position. And again, there's leads and lags to this whole thing. So it can take a little while before we see the consumer starting to struggle holistically. And if we",

And if we look at the 25th, nothing really going on home sales again, I don't see anything really on the 25th. That's jumping out at me. The 26th big day. So we have GDP quarter over quarter final. We have jobless claims. Both of those are going to be a really big deal because now we need to see based on the cut that we had, what kind of path are we on? And then we also have a bunch of different Fed speaker, but our boy Jay Powell will be speaking in the morning. So that typically brings with it a little bit of market volatility. And then on the 27th, we have more inflation level metrics. So we have things like PCE, both regular and core. And then we have the University of Michigan sentiment. So when I look across this personal income consumption, these I'm expecting to see kind of fall within a range based on again, what I'm seeing here. But I think the big thing is the market is now trying to see what is the path forward? How likely is it that we find ourselves in a soft landing? And there's actually a really important series",

How likely is it that we find ourselves in a soft landing? And there's actually a really important series of events coming up very soon that are going to help us identify that. So if we take a look now at the calendar, it's pretty quiet right now. But again, if we take a look at October, we start to open up with the banks reporting earnings. I think this earnings report is going to be really this earning season is going to be really, really important. And the banks are kind of like the Canary and the coal mine. You'll be able to see how they're behaving in the current environment and what they're forecasting for the rest of the year. And all of them are going to integrate obviously their expected impacts from the Fed rate cuts. Because if we take a look now at the Fed watch tool, the Fed rate scenario or really the sofa rate is really interesting. So if we take a look at the probabilities here, it's literally already showing the probability of us landing between four and a quarter and four and a half as 51 percent come the seven November meeting. So this is going to be really important to track because that's showing literally a greater than 50 percent",

So this is going to be really important to track because that's showing literally a greater than 50 percent probability right now today of another 50 basis point cut. That starts to become kind of aggressive. And I thought that the recent rate cut was whatever, it's 50 basis points in terms of where we're at is not a giant deal. But if we continue down this path, that I don't want to say is alarming, but it is concerning, I think, because obviously the probability of no change is essentially null. It's gone away entirely. And we're 50, 50 split between 25 basis points in 50. That starts to get really aggressive. And it has us hitting this two and three quarters to three percent. It has us landing there by September of next year, which this is the first spot where I see the probability of a pause that surprises me. I would expect to see a pause much sooner in the sequence. But I mean, who knows? We'll soon find out. So when I look across the broad market, though, I think this upcoming earnings is going to be really informative for us. So I'm eagerly awaiting that.
