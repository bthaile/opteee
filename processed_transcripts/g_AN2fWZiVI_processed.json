It's like similar color, but we got Doomburg back to talk about the markets, the economy, some geopolitics probably. It's great to see you. Hey Eric, great to be back. I bring the green. You bring the muscles. It's like, it's between the two of us. We probably can get up one Hulk out of the two of us. That you could be. Wouldn't be a good look at Hulk with me in it, but you know. So we've been catching up, you know, like every quarter or so, just touching based on how things were going. And I thought it would be a really great spot to start with your current broad analysis of the US landscape, specific thinking about economy, energy, the markets. Any of those if you want to dive into one surface level on another totally cool. I just want to start with like, what are you seeing from your view? What's most interesting to you? Sure. Obviously, a lot going on. One of the challenges of being an analyst in the Trump era is the speed and violence of the new cycle. Every day is in the story. And much of macroeconomic analysis is really measuring flows. And netting out the flows can be really challenging if there's a lot of flows, right? And so in February, our industrial context started raising alarm",

And netting out the flows can be really challenging if there's a lot of flows, right? And so in February, our industrial context started raising alarm about recession supply chains, and then it started raising up on just the threat of tariffs. Basically, that's a really important signal in our view. And then one of the challenges of measuring the government data, which is actually really where I was going with this, is because people are front running things. You're going to get wild measurements across multiple data, like people front running the tariffs on the Sun you see a sort of imports. Well, that affects the measured GDP number. Does it really reflect authentic, sustainable economic activity? Liberation day happens. Shocked everybody. Trump is playing his hand. He has one card to play, which is to get as much of his agenda down as quickly as possible. Ripped the bandade off. While he still has political capital, he needs to have the economy turning around and on the upswing by next summer. And the gamble is that a combination of tariffs, tax cuts, foreign direct investment and cheap energy prices will be enough to catalyze a manufacturing boom in the US. The big question is whether he can bridge between the clearly unworkable, unsustainable old state and a disputable weather. It would be workable new",

The big question is whether he can bridge between the clearly unworkable, unsustainable old state and a disputable weather. It would be workable new state. But to be fair to Trump, it's exactly what he can't paint on and he's kept his promises to a T. And so it's a fascinating thing to watch. You know, his trip to the Middle East was actually quite remarkable. And in our own private investing, we're seeing the beginnings of a huge wave of interest from sovereign wealth funds to capitalize investments that have, you know, a manufacturing base or the potential for one in the US. And that will create a boom. It will with all booms, there will be frauds and, you know, people who lose a lot of money and people who make fortunes. And so it's, it's just really hard. So, but I would say on the energy side, which is what we care about the most and right about the most. Trump has declared that he wants 50 oil and he seems likely to get it. And the Saudis have seen willing to help Trump pull it off. I think it matters far less than Russia now than it would have if we had pursued that strategy three and a half years ago. But that that's my sort of overall view. Energy's",

As you're going through that I literally have like six questions that I need to follow up with you on all go and order. The first one you mentioned early on in that the just the macro analysis that you guys do. And I imagine it's such a difficult system to accurately forecast with how many variables come in and how far away. And how far away. And how far away. How do you manage that? So first of all, nobody bats a thousand. And you have to begin the management of that with humility. We try to communicate to our subscribers that we are lateral thinkers.

So for example, we made one of our best calls of all time in December. When long before Mark Karni was a contract you could bet on on polymarket. We predicted correctly that not only would he replace Justin Shuddo before the election, but he would be a formidable candidate to against the conservatives with the help of the notoriously planned media in Canada and low and behold now he's the prime minister. We came to that prediction based on a mental model that we like to use, which is just make a wild assumption.

And we're absolutely confident in our abilities and we're proud of our work. And, you know, we measure ourselves against our own standard. And I think that comes through. Yeah, I love that. It's funny too, because even more in like the trading side of the world where I exist, it's the same thing, right, where everybody's so interested in trying to figure out who was right on this news headline. And it, I always find it's missing the force for the trees. And I like that process based each piece regardless of what ends up happening will have stuff in it. That's usable. That provokes thought.

What do you make of the various arguments circulating around that? Some saying like, this is good for these reasons, national security, bringing jobs, other people will say things like. Americans don't want some of those jobs. So why would we bother bringing low skill jobs back. What's your opinion on, on short more manufacturing? On a bash of the 100 for it, Trump deserves full credit for trying to get it. The US and capital markets in general do a very poor job of pricing national security risk. And I think failed immigration policy has driven down the wages of such jobs with point where Americans can't really make a living doing those jobs, at least compared to their neighbors.

But I actually don't have a doubt his authenticity and look at all the things everybody says he is including his critics, right? Like yes, Trump University was the scam. Like the same person who did Trump University was just treated like a king in the Middle East and worked tirelessly to bring trillions of dollars of foreign direct investment into the United States. I genuinely believe that Trump wants to catalyze a manufacturing of Renaissance, especially in the Midwest and I live in the Midwest. I've seen the devastation and the consequences of financialization and globalization. First hand participated in it when I was in corporate. So all of those things are true and also Trump coin is a scam. I don't understand the valuation of truth social. All of it is true and I think it's okay to say that we can measure them in holistically.

You can't bring in a trillion dollars of foreign money without a whole bunch of people on Wall Street and executives and investors and venture capitalists and private equity firms coming out way better than they were. Will some of it trickle down? I hope so. To your point, like do people really want to do these jobs? I mean, I think they do. Many of them do. I mean, there's still a hardcore group of Americans who would like to provide for their family and are willing to do an honest days work for an honest days pay. But I don't kid yourself.

One of the things I've been trying to understand a little bit better is been OPEC stance on a lot of this and they've seen way more accommodating than I originally would have expected. How do you view their lens on what's going on? Yeah,",

How do you view their lens on what's going on? Yeah, we read a couple of pieces on this and I think we've gotten this one mostly right. There was a deal cut. Look, whenever you have Russia, Saudi Arabia and the United States sitting around negotiating with each other for weeks at a time, history tells us that when the three largest or producer's like that get together, whatever the headline reason is for them to be meeting is almost never really what it's all about. And so for weeks we had the whole Ukraine thing talks were hosted in Saudi Arabia. We believe a broader more consequential deal than just settling the war in Ukraine, which of course is very consequential, especially for those who live in Ukraine. Something else is going on back channels. And I think a deal was cut, who knows what was given in return. We have some speculations in that regard. But OPEC is suddenly doing Trump's bidding. Let me let's just be honest. And they're masking it as though they're punishing Kazakhstan for cheating. She needs me going on an OPEC for F who we kidding. A deal was cut.

Did you see the standing Ovation he got when he announced that they were going to lift the sanctions on Syria, which is all other ball-awaks? And the tsunami of cash committed to back Trump. I think a lot of it has to do with a want Trump to succeed. They want JD Vance to win in 28. They want what Trump is trying to do in America to work. And then there's a whole broader thought around Trump's civil war with the deep state. And Pimple Malgrim wrote a really fascinating piece of which I could remember the title. Basically saying that he's getting the help of these countries to stare down the deep state. And if you model the U.S. as currently being in a civil war, then all of this can make a lot more sense. Lord knows the CIA has messed around in the Middle East for an awful long time. And people have probably pretty tired of it over there. And look at what he's doing with Harvard in",

I'm sure you follow it, or you've seen it. You know, the attack on Harvard, which some judge just issued a temporary restraining organization Why it already hours later, to Trump's move to Bar Harvard from accepting foreign students. That's actually an attack on the intelligence community because it's just part of their giant grift. So there's lots of ways we can go with that, but I'm just fascinated to watch all of it like we've said. So in what do you think the primary incentives would be for OPEC to want Trump and his policies to succeed? Well, they unified Middle East, buffered from outside interference and the forever wars and the war would arand. And the war in Syria. If they could settle all of that and be left alone to enjoy their riches, that's a prize worth suffering or a few quarters of declining profits for.

But it's never what it's being presented that's actually what's happening whenever you have momentous, decade, shape shifting type moves like we're seeing now. And so my hope, my suspicion, is that Trump has a grand plan of settling the war and you're going to be a great. Settling the war in Ukraine, driving peace in the Middle East and reaching data on with China. Cutting back on Middle Thursday spending in the long run because we don't need a trillion dollars a year. And shepherding a US manufacturing renaissance with all of the assets of the Western Hemisphere there for for development. And the Hemisphere is way more than self-sufficient and I think the sort of multiple world that Trump envisions. That is the US's fear of influence. And I think that's the grand plan. And look if you get to the thundish you give them a double piece price. Three of them. But we'll see. Lots of people in the US don't want any of those objectives to get done. So.

Those are the people that are going to be the most resistant to see that system change. You'd mentioned earlier touched on it quickly, but I always think it's worth discussing because I think the way it's been flowing is been very different than pretty much whatever but you might have thought which is the Russian-Korean conflict. Obviously Trump had talked about solving it essentially as soon as you got in. And then reality comes in. How do you think that spend progressing and where do you think we go forward with respect to the conflict? I don't think the conflict can be solved in any other way other than militarily.

More and more we're getting through as the sort of early anti-missile defenses were being overwhelmed. And so I think last reports I saw like 60 out of 500 drones or so and don't quote me but got made it into the Moscow area, which is quite alarming to the Russians. And it's going to provoke a response of pushing for their back. Last time I was on the show, I made statements to the effect that I believe the war was lost. And that it would be in Ukraine's interest to make peace and I know that that probably triggered some people because it's just not how the war is being reported in the West and the Western legacy media.

The strongest proof I could say that validated my last appearance is that the winning side doesn't demand ceasefire. And which side is demanding a ceasefire right now. It's the NATO side. What makes you say that the winning side doesn't demand ceasefire? The winning side has no need for a ceasefire. The winning side is fine to keep marching. It's right Ukraine needs a positive VR and they've been very like my crown and Starmer have been very a word about this. That's have an unconditional ceasefire. No restrictions on arm supply to Ukraine. We're going to fly in some British and French troops as trip wires. And then we're going to army cranes of the team. It gives me a better chance to fight after the ceasefire. And the Russians have openly and consistently said we're not going to play that game anymore. We've been fooled by that before. Now again, no matter what you're using the war, I'm just telling you, when you look at the area that the Russians are curing in the pace of area in May, which is of course they're getting out of the muddy season. And the tanks can now roll without getting stuck in the mud. They're going to go all in for a military victory. And absent a large appropriation",

I don't know how it ends in any other way out of the military. And again, this session they had in Istanbul was a, yeah, in Turkey in Istanbul. I think the Russians took a tough line. And it's not, look, it's totally tragic situation. It was totally avoidable. Trump is caught in a trap. He, I think correctly, leaves that if he had won the 2020 election, there would not have been a war in Ukraine. And so he doesn't feel like it's his war. But the US is a party to the war. So he can't really be a mediator. Because the moment the US stop supplying weapons and intelligence, it's going to be very difficult for Ukraine to hold back the Russian army. The heroic defense they've been able to put up has been underwritten by US weapons, US intelligence, US generals. And every day that Trump continues to provide that, which he is doing because he doesn't want to see sort of a Vietnam style collapse, which is understandable. And the loss of the war",

So, but anytime we talk about Ukraine, we annoy some people, and it is what it is. But I think we've been proven mostly right on what we've said. And the information is all there. But you have to understand that every piece of information you're getting is propaganda. And you have to have a mechanism to read everybody's propaganda. And then observe developments as you unfold and go back to the sources that predicted various things, and see which one was mostly right. And then you sort of add more credibility weight to that source over time, as they're more and more right. And lastly, I'll say, is almost no Western media outlets, and very few consumers of news in the West actually read what the Russians are writing, or listen to what they're saying to understand what their positions are. And if they did, they would probably have a different view. So I think it's okay to read both the key of independent and task. The English",

This is how the Ukrainians are describing it. This is how the Russians are describing it. Let's wait through four days and see which side is more accurate. Sometimes the Russians are blatantly pedaling disinformation, not my favorite word, but sometimes Ukrainians are spreading propaganda. And sometimes it's a synthesis of the two that is probably right. So for example, the whole reporting around the massage drone attack on Moscow was reported wildly differently between the Russians and Ukrainians. You see that enough times. So for example, if the Russians claim that every single drone was shot down and then you're seeing video footage of explosions along the path from Moscow, well then you know, maybe that Russian minister defense was, was fibbing a little bit. Okay, you have to put that into back of your mind. And so again, it's very hard, especially with war. Because the closer your art to it, and the more emotionally you get about it. And emotion is never good for objective analysis. We can't have said a better. I think in it's one of those conflicts that does have a lot to it that",

We wrote a piece yesterday called Exerereal Examinations, where reading the team that he says we try to do, we believe that what's going to happen is that the US military is going to be leveraged to circumvent civilian obstacles to the deployment of nuclear reactors to power artificial intelligence data centers. I think you're going to see Google and Facebook and then video setting up on military campuses, leveraging the defense production powers act or whatever it's called. And basically stripping the energy of the ability to block impede or otherwise veto the development of safe nuclear power, while Trump sets about the task of cutting the energy and rebuilding it back in his image. And I think he and Chris Wright and Dr. Bergam and the whole American energy dominance committee knows inherently that the energy has been the log jam. And we talked about why that isn't that piece.

So we, the bureaucracy chokes out innovation and there's no bigger bureaucracy than the Pentagon. I can only tell like, don't worry, it's a very small team. You can count the contributing members of Dubbergon one hand with multiple fingers left over. And we joke internally that if we hire 10 people, we'd be 50 as productive in total because you spend all your time managing with 10 people. It's okay to just do things yourself. Just go and do. Don't ask. The last thing you want to do is get an opinion of a lawyer. Like lawyers advise and leaders decide, go, point, pull the trigger. This is why, by the way, I've never been in the military.

And so like the lowest rank and when I was an executive, I always try to do this. When I was leading large teams and you have what's called span and control. Like, so I'm sure you know, very similar in corporate world as to the military, accept this less death. How many people can a manager actually manage and how many layers between you and the field. And all of my conversations with my leaders as I grew up with the corporate chain was, here's your accountability. Here's your control. Let's start by describing both of those and make sure that there's no mismatch. Because there's nothing worse than having more accountability than you have control. Because you can't complete the mission. And if you have more control than you have accountability, that's not so good either. So my goal was always clear goal writing and matching accountability with control. You have the authority to hire, to fire, to promote, to develop. But this is the substance decisions I need to be consulted on. It's a classic race, responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed. And if you spell that out and you have good leaders and you trust them. And their successes theirs and their failures are ours. And if you know that your leadership has that mindset, then",

Yeah, but you know, they didn't do that to Rubio because he's a senator and he's a member of the club. So I, he's not always that way. Going back to energy.

A well-informed bad actor could do significant damage to the global economy with a very, very small repertoire of weapons. I'm guessing that almost nobody listening to this podcast has ever heard of the words, Ross Tenerra before. Probably you haven't. How definitely have not. Yeah, Ross Tenerra is home to the world's most important energy production site. Tiny island of Qatar. Qatar produces, you know, enormous amount of natural gas that ends up on ships, most of it. And it's fed to places like Japan, Korea, Europe now. And it's a very small area in the middle of the Middle East. Well within the hoothies range. And it wouldn't take much in the way of a concerted effort to destroy that facility, to disrupt the global economy. There's two pipelines that connect Russia to Turkey. That Russia has accused and I think Turkey has quite agreed. Ukraine has been trying to blow up. The North Stream pipeline, I think, was a catastrophe. Exploding that pipeline was a disaster because it normalizes the wanth and destruction of critical energy infrastructure. And once we go down that road, a lot of the outcomes.

There are two large pipelines that connect Russia to Turkey that then go on to feed gas to places like Hong Kong. And it'll be a big disaster for us to places like Hong Kong, and Slovakia, Italy, and broader Europe. And if we wake up one day and you hear that either Turks Dream or Blue Stream has been damaged or destroyed in a terrorist attack, all bets are off. But the thing about energy is you gain efficiency at scale. And scale necessarily means concentration. You have concentrated risks. And so I think terrorism is it. It could happen in the US. Freeport LNG had a mysterious explosion shortly after the whole North Stream affair. And there was a lot of rumors that maybe this was Russian cyber attack that who knows, back to propaganda and disinformation. You start taking out LNG export terminals.

I think the long term consequences of the Nord Stream attack hold the potential to be severe. And when countries get desperate, I think Ukraine is desperate, understandably so. Losing wars is hard. If it's existential, you will need to do anything. And so there was an attack on the Turks Dream compressive stations that apparently the Russian air defense is a managed knockout. If that attack had been successful, ironically, the Europeans would have been in a world of hurt. Now, summertime, the risk is a little bit less. You see that pipeline go out in November. It's a whole different story. This is probably a pretty ignorant question, but I'm curious about it. In the world of nuclear power adoption, what kind of role do you think AI think is a little easier to wrap your arms around the potential impact? But what about something like quantum computing, which is a little further off, is there any tie-ins from your lens with respect to those two systems? And how can impact? I'm mostly thinking nuclear, but maybe energy more broadly. So the cutting edge of computing, the very cutting edge of computing, while it's being developed",

    "text": "it. So if they have 80 giga lots of installed capacity today, they need 200. And you need to meet future demand. Just unbelievable numbers. To the point where you're going to run out of gas turbines, and there's a shortage of those, and you're going to run out of transformers, and there's a shortage of those. And this is why we believe that a piece we wrote last year will prove prescient. The piece was called E-reconcilable differences where we predicted that AI is intapetable with the grid. Why? The grid is useful to society incredibly so, but only if it's at least three nines reliable and cheap. You can't put AI into the existing culture and architecture that we use to build maintain and manage the grid and succeed with the speed that AI demands. Without radically driving the price higher, which crushes everybody in society, especially Joe Sixpack. So this is why I think distributed SMRs natural gas goes in one side. Data comes out the other. Fission happens on one side of the building and data comes out the other. Is this solution where you don't have to worry about grid connections you aren't creating demand? Because like these companies will pay way more than you and I like to pay, or industry likes to pay for electricity. And we need you and I and we need industry, because ultimately AI is supposed to be in service of us and not the other way around. So",

Another that we're at time I had one more question if you have a moment sure. Yeah, also I'll keep it quick. When we're looking out over the rest of the year and you're thinking of the interplay of literally everything that's going on today. Like if you were to pick two or three primary themes your most interested in remainder of the year, what are those. Yeah, Trump's response to Russia's continuation of the war in Ukraine. Whether Trump falls into the trap of going to war in Iran. And whether Trump can achieve a date on with China over the Taiwan issue. And if he succeeds in avoiding escalation, especially in the last two, he will be a pretty consequential president in my view. And I think you know, Trump is kind of like the last person I spoke to kind of guy like if you get Trump he's going to. He's a people person he's very high EQ right. And so",

He's a people person he's very high EQ right. And so he just spent a lot of time in the Middle East and got noticed that he didn't stop in Israel, which is interesting. So that that's what I'm watching. If we go to war in Iran, I think it'll sink his presidency. I think he knows that intuitively. There's a lot of people in Washington want to go to war in Iran and many of them work in his administration. So, you know, Russia Ukraine is sort of it is Biden's war and Trump's at least trying to end it. And you could plausibly say that it wasn't really his fault. But if Iran happens, that's him and if China happens, that's him. And war is always a failure of diplomacy and it would be Trump's failures. And so I quite literally pray that he navigates the situations in a voice conflict. Really interesting. Very last one I promise if you were to attach a probability to those different outcomes. How are you weighing the odds? Or that Trump's going to walk away from Ukraine. And the narrative will be the sort of classic stab in the back narrative and it would be Trump's fault that Ukraine collapsed. And if",
