    "text": "Managing an options portfolio is completely different than pretty much any other portfolio you can think of because options behave very differently. So what I want to walk you through on the left hand side here is some core concepts. Then I want to walk you through the three levels that I manage my portfolio through. And then at the end of the video, I'm going to walk you through exactly how I split out my portfolio and think about deploying it. What's up everyone? Eric here. Welcome back to the outliers. Shout out to the Patreon family. Consider signing up for weekly workshops, all sorts of fun, extra content. But let's get right in. So what are the core concepts here for managing a portfolio? Well, it all starts with this. Begin with the end in mind. What does that mean? Well, you kind of have to define what you're trying to do in order to stand a good chance at completing it. So if you think about what most of our goals are in trading, it's things like achieve a certain percent return per year. It's be able to make a certain amount of monthly income. It's reduce portfolio draw down. Those are great goals. But you have to figure out what works for you and what makes the most sense. And you might be wondering how to do that. And it's really, really simple. You can navigate to my website. Come over here to the resources. Go",

And it's really, really simple. You can navigate to my website. Come over here to the resources. Go to the compound interest calculator. And you can figure out what you need. This is it. This is beginning with the end in mind. So if you're starting with a 15,000 trading account, you want to have a million dollars in 25 years. Let's say, well, at this current run rate, 10 per year, your 15,000 is going to give you 162, 520. We have a long way to go. So now maybe we need to focus on saving some money. Maybe we can get 1,000 per month on average over the long run. And then boom, all of a sudden we're there. Maybe you don't want to do 1,000 per month because that's a little expensive. You want to do something like 750 a month. And then you think, okay, that gets you there too. Maybe you could do a little bit better. Maybe instead of 10, you think you could do maybe 15. And see where that lands you. So the point is, this shouldn't be completely random. You should figure out what your roadmap looks like. And then you have to ask yourself these two questions. Are your goals realistic? What makes you think they're realistic? So",

So are they realistic means if a trader says to me, I want to make 25 per year. Totally cool. Is it doable? Of course. Is it doable for that trader? I have no idea. Does that trader know? Probably if they're asking the question, I imagine. They don't know either, which probably tells me that they're shooting way too aggressively. In my opinion, in the beginning, the best target is avoiding drawdowns. And that's simply because they set you too far back. And you don't gain that much from trying to have these crazy good returns early on if you're drawing your account down in pursuit of them. So once you have a bit of a track record, three months paper trading, six months paper trading, and you have some ideas of what you're able to do, then you can decide whether or not your 25 is realistic. But you can have whatever goal you want that doesn't mean that it's going to happen. It's up to you to make it happen. And man of fasting only gets you so far.

The problem is so many people, they think about the trade as they're putting it on. And they're not thinking through the life cycle of the trade. So that's going to be a core concept that you got to keep in mind as we go through this. The next couple, for me, I like to think about breaking my portfolio into different allocations, a core and speculative. We'll get into more detail on that later. You just have to come up with a general guiding feature for how you're going to use your money. The next thing here is making sure that as we're looking at our entire portfolio, we want to de-conflict positions. We want to use stuff that behaves differently, that we have different profit mechanisms that we're tapping into, that we have different durations that we're looking at, different correlations. That's my approach. Other people can have a fastball meeting, they have one specific style trade, and they like one specific duration, that's okay too. But the idea here is to make sure that whatever you're doing fits into the broader portfolio effectively. The trade",

When you're looking at managing a portfolio, you're looking at the culmination of a bunch of different positions that interact with one another over time sustained. We need to really focus on how these different positions behave in relation to one another. The big takeaway from this concept section is that there's no right answer. It's dependent completely on you. If your goal is to aggressively grow your portfolio, you might have a different approach. If your goal is to defensively manage your portfolio, meaning avoid draw downs, you're going to have a different approach. You have to figure out what you're trying to do, and then start solving the problem from there, which we're going to get into on this side. The other thing is just avoid this idea of blanket rules. They're stupid. So things like, oh, nobody ever went broke taking profits. The problem is eventually you can. As soon as risk is eventually realized, it can be enough to wipe out all your profits, and you can lose money. All I'm highlighting here is make it make sense. Go back to this expected return. If",

But trying to stick to general blanket rules like that, I think are too boxy, and they miss too many potential details for a trader. So as we move through the rest of this, these are the three questions you should be able to answer at any given point in time about your portfolio. Do you understand your portfolio's entire risk at a given point in time? And we'll take a look at how to do that well. Does your portfolio reflect your disposition to look at what that means? Do you need manage anything? Take a look at that. Let's start with the top level. This idea of disposition. What is this? This is where I look at these different market inputs. Like, what's the economy doing? Do we have an expanding or contracting GDP? We in a high inflation period or a deflationary period? Are jobs growing effectively or not? All those details matter. And as you'll notice, it moves from zoomed really far out economy. Then we're going to look at the stock market as a whole. The individual indices and the",

The sectors, what sectors are outperforming underperforming. What are the primary themes of the current environment that you're investing in? And are there any events coming up? This is the first layer of developing a disposition. And it might sound like a lot. But once you get good at looking at things, this takes just a few moments. So you can say, well, right now some of the primary themes is AI has been coming out really hot and there's a lot of speculation around that. AI has been on an absolute tear and it's going to need to deliver extremely well in order to not have a pretty significant drawback. So those kinds of things can paint the way we think about the entire market and then how we choose to structure our portfolio. So our portfolio should align with the way that we think about our disposition. So for example, if I go through the disposition phase and I look at a contracting economy, the market looks really weak. We're seeing a lot of negative breadth. We're seeing the indices trending down. I'm going to have a generally bearish disposition. Do I want to",

So the idea here is to make sure that what you're doing in your portfolio aligns with what you think the market and the economy looks like it's doing. Now at the portfolio level, there's a bunch of things we need to look at. We need to look at how we're allocating our money. So what trades get what amount of money and on the next part of this, you'll get a look at how I think about that. Utilization, how much money you want to move at a given point in time. So if you're in a disposition where you think we're in kind of a transitory phase and you want to see what the market's going to do, well, maybe you lighten up your utilization at that point. Or if there's something that has you really convicted and you want to use way more money because you have strong conviction, well, maybe we jack up our utilization so that aligns with their disposition. Beta-weighted Delta's, this is a really great way to assess your portfolio risk. It takes all of the different positions that",

I'll drop a video in the description below that walks through beta-weighted Delta's in detail. This is a go-to for me. So in a nutshell, these first three are super important to me. This is going to tell me how much money am I ready to use in my portfolio? How much money am I currently using right now? And what is the directional disposition of the portfolio? So if I look at my beta-weighted Delta's and their 10 spy beta-weighted Delta's, all that means is that the entire portfolio is behaving like 10 shares of spy. Is that a lot? Is that a little? Does that align with my disposition? That's going to be a starting point for what I do here on out. I'm going to review the number of positions I have, what their sizing is because, again, remember, options move. So as they move around, the no-sional size of your positions can change as your Delta's change. So you have to make sure that the position is sized and operating as you want.

Am I taking in net money or am I paying net money? I prefer to be positive theta in the portfolio. What's my portfolio gamma? How fast is my portfolio Delta going to change? You can devise all of that from your portfolio Greeks, which are really useful tools. The correlations is really important as you're putting on new positions and adjusting old positions because let's say that you have 10 positions on, but nine of them behave like the same thing. You might have more risk than you think you do. Beta-weighted Delta's will help you see that, but so will monitoring the correlation between the different products that you have on because the relationships change. Great example of this is the way that bonds behaved against equities during 2020 to essentially 2024. That way now to a degree, kind of normalizing more recently. But that relationship changed. So you might have been banking on it behaving a certain way, but then it didn't.

Other breakers is saying at the portfolio level, if I experience a X percent portfolio level drawdown, I'm going to start closing positions. It's a tough decision and you have to figure out what that might look like for you. The reason why I like to use circuit breakers is because it keeps me from becoming paralyzed if things are not going well and I need to make some changes to what I'm doing. So thinking of those ahead of time and understanding that there's a possibility that you run through your circuit breakers, if it's 25, your portfolio draws down 25, you start cutting positions and then it rebounds back up. That might feel absolutely terrible. But if that's the way that you're perceiving the markets, you're at a disadvantage from the jump because just as you might be going through a 25 drawdown here, well, guess what? You might have gotten out at 25 when it drops another 25. Or you could get out at 25 and then it rullies back up and you're like, damn, I didn't need to take that loss.

So now we have our disposition towards the market, the economy. We now know how we want our portfolio to look and what we're looking at in the portfolio. Now we just need to make sure that each individual trade fits the puzzle of the portfolio. So the first thing I'm going to look at with every single position is, do I need to manage it from PL or taste expiration, meaning am I at a profit management point, a loss management point, or have I been in the trade long enough that I need to manage it based on time? What are the Greeks of the individual position? Do all of those look aligned with my expectations based on when I entered it? And does it still make sense for the portfolio? Do I have any events coming up that I have to be aware of? Is earnings coming up soon? Based on all of those things, if I'm still in the clear, there's nothing has to be done with the position.

I'm going to make sure that there were no events that I missed that popped up in the middle of this thing that I wasn't aware of. And always ensure that the trades that I'm putting on have a positive expected return. So that's just a general flow for what this can look like. So again, we have our disposition towards the market. We figure out how we want our portfolio to look and then we make sure each individual position fits into this. So if we're bullish, we want to have long spy beta-weighted deltas. We're going to look for positions that complement that. Now we start putting on a bunch of positions where long a bunch of calls and different things, but I said I like being long theta, meaning I'm collecting theta on a daily basis. So that means I'm going to have to put on some positions that bring in theta that may be tamper down some of my risk because after I put on all of those long calls, I'm actually a",

So what's the total allocation I'll give to my score, my score, my core and speculative trades? I guess that's the combination of both of those. For the core allocation, it gets up to 100. I'm happy to use the entire portfolio on a core allocation. First speculative, I'm okay using up to 60 of my capital. This gives me a lot of room. Now I very, very would get anything close to that. And more importantly, this is going to be completely dependent on how speculative you like to be as a trader and how you like to set up your risk. For position sizing, I will use up to 100 on the",

And more importantly, this is going to be completely dependent on how speculative you like to be as a trader and how you like to set up your risk. For position sizing, I will use up to 100 on the core allocation. For an individual speculative trade, I will risk no more than 10 of the portfolio value. So while I might be using a lot of the portfolio, I'm not going to allow the risk that's in each trade to exceed 10. So what's up with this? Why do I do this? Well, the core allocation for me is the primary way I'm looking to meet my annual return objectives. Now I can't always get it through the core allocation because in these next two you'll see the profit mechanisms that I'm using are things like positive drift, sector rotation and momentum. So I'm trading things like indices and ETFs. If we're in a bear market, this ain't going to work that well. So I need to lean more heavily and use more money in my speculative allocation in order to make up the difference using some of these other kinds of strategies. So you can see the strategies that I use in both the different kinds of profit mechanisms that I'm looking to take advantage of. What I'm looking to do is lean on the core allocation as much as I can. And then as soon as that's",

And then as soon as that's coming up short on my monthly targets, because I take my annual targets and break them down into smaller targets, monthly targets. If I'm coming up short or if there's a big change in market conditions, then I'll rotate over to the speculative allocation and try to leverage this a little bit more. Conversely, if I'm doing great and my core allocation is meeting expectations and exceeding them, then I'll still use my speculative allocation, but I just become very selective. I'm just looking for really great looking opportunities to complement the return performance of the portfolio. So that's it in a nutshell. The way I think about managing a portfolio starts with these three levels, gotta be able to answer all these questions. And it's a big puzzle that has to fit together. As always, if you have any questions, let me know. Be an outlier. See you guys later.",
