    "text": "Here's a sneaky way to blow up your options trading accounts by doing something that seems really safe by selling really, really high probability trades. If we take a look here in spy and we go super far out of the money, we're talking delta's in the three decimal points where it's like 0.00 something and you collect a tiny, 80-bitty little tiny amount of money. You can see you get 15, 16 cents for example, this 400-put. Well, the problem with this trade is you are collecting such a tiny little bit amount of money that you are likely going to win the overwhelming majority of times. But sometimes it will lose and when this loses, those losses can undo multiples of the winning trades. And since you're not making a whole lot of money per trade, sometimes traders what they'll do is they'll put on a bunch of these because you're trying to collect a hundred bucks, but you're not going to get there on 15. So you have to put on 10 of them. I don't know if it's sudden if you get a big move while you have 10 of those on in a small account, you can be looking at a really rough trade. You might even get a margin call. So you have to pay attention when you're doing this activity, we refer to as selling the tales. It can be done. It'd be super, super thoughtful. The dollar, see you later.",
