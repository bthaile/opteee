Perfect. Yeah. Absolutely. It's it's an absolute pleasure to have you on. I have a chance to go through your Twitter a little bit as I do and stock people. And you have a lot of really interesting perspectives, especially as it comes to kind of like a just macro market discussions and some of the other things that we're just kind of doing a preamble to some of the precious metals. Topics and things like that. So I'm looking forward to diving into those with you for sure. But first off, welcome to the channel. Thank you. Yep. Second off, I would love to start with just a little bit of your background. So I saw that you're from what's up, Paul? Yes. I was born and raised in Brazil, lived in the state of Sao Paulo for until my age of 20, I guess 19. Then I moved to the west to play tennis in college. And then the rest is history. I guess I've been here for for some time now. Yeah, man. So did you do Jiu Jitsu while you were there? No, believe it or not, I am probably the only Brazilian who doesn't know how to do Jiu Jitsu or play soccer very well. So. What? Yeah.",

I'm in San Diego. And the grappling coach there is Dean Lister who spent a lot of time in Brazil. So he talks about, you know, just growing up there and whatnot. So I had to ask. But all right, maybe we can convert you into Jiu Jitsu. You know, I'm hopeful. I would love to. It's so fun. It's physical chess is what it comes down to you right now. I'm like 235 pounds. Like I mean, you're really strong. But I've never felt like such just a whos compared to like some of these 160 pound dudes that are just so well versed. That's why I love Jiu Jitsu because you could be strong, but it's very, very mental. Well, I am the huge fan of MMA and UFC. I'm not going to lie. So you're already there. Yeah. I just can't do anything on in terms of that, but certainly watch it a lot. Yeah. Well, good. Jiu Jitsu is a perfect entrance into that. There's no like face punching and stuff.

So I moved to Liberty University in Virginia. I was recruited play tennis in college. I played tennis, started playing tennis when I was 14 and then when I was 18 or 19. I was started to move or look for universities in the US. I knew there was ways of getting scholarships here. To play sports and then perhaps get education in a cheaper way than in Brazil and also learn English and so forth. And I was I always loved the American culture. And so it was a very easy move when he comes to that and you know, I fell in love with it. And I'm still I'm still here. Yeah, that's awesome.

My dad had his own business. He was very successful. He did very well, especially in the 90s and early 2000s and and then things turn south and when things turn south. Whereas you know, I was I was a teenager and I was very difficult to see everything, you know, just literally going from everything to nothing. And so for me, I always helped him in many different ways of being very dynamically. And so I was really involved in his business along with my parents and my mom as well. And so the entire family had really get together to go through that pain of of a downturn economically and financially. So after that, I think of how has been fascinated by financial markets and I think in college was really when I started to read a lot about finance and read a lot about the economy and then I started investing my own money and loss of money and that was part of a lot of experience in that period started to move forward and really I mean, I remember back in college.

I'm extremely fortunate for the job that I have and I'm always happy to be part of this. But then let's see, I think when I move to Colorado after college, I actually met Kevin in a tennis court. Kevin is the CIO and founder of Crasuke Capital. After working in finance and other as an intern in other places, I really started working with them and got most of his principles when he comes to approach of investing and learning about quant models, which he always used a lot of his proprietary quant models in order to run or really manage capital.

A lot, a lot of things, a lot of turns in that in, you know, I'm just telling you the very short story, but that has been a lot that happened in that period. But now after what 11 years maybe I've been, you know, with Kevin now working pretty, you know, pretty good relationship with him and now Quentin Haney as well. So the company has grown. The fund is now we're managing some more close to 300 million dollars of capital today. So a lot of things have changed since the beginning. I mean, we went from a 50 million, you know, AUM to a 300 million AUM in the course of three to four years. So things have gone a lot of a lot of big changes in my life.

And now as a partner, now my goal is to continue to grow here and make this one of the best macro shops in the world. That's the whole goal. That's awesome, man. So I want to talk to you a little bit about a Crescat. But before that, you said something that really, really resonated with me because it was, I don't know, just a perspective that I've never really thought much about. And you were talking about that you had, you know, your dad was very successful in business. And the economic downturn, you know, is really where you all went through like this adjustment period. And I'm just personally curious about that because I find like most of my circle that I know most of us came from almost an inverse where we started like I had a single mom who was working two jobs trying to keep the lights on essentially.

I'm just really curious like your thoughts about that time period and how that has fueled the rest of your trajectory in the finance space. I know you said it got you interested, but you know, just again from a personal perspective, curious about that cycle in your life. Well, I think, you know, first of a wealthy or emerging wealthy family in Brazil would be considered perhaps in international standards more of middle class, especially in the US, but not sure what is worth what's worse is if it's you starting from zero or starting from something and then go into zero when you were 14 15.

It just, I for my mind, I was like really empathizing with that experience because I think the part to me that would make it so devastating is obviously your dad had risked so much even to get to that point. And then to have this huge unwinding essentially of all of it, like that to me is just that's devastating. So, I mean, I can't, I mean, and then your dad obviously just kind of bootstrapped it, right? Like he decided, okay, okay, well, we got to make some changes here and we'll get back together.

Yeah, I mean, if I always make sure I wasn't good, you know, good education in Brazil, I always had very good. I was always attending good places in terms of learning from different people. And that was always, I think, a key part of building up, you know, this foundation to where we are today. However, yeah, it messes with you, especially psychologically. And it's incredible that my parents' marriage went through all that and they really got together and things were fine. But it was not key. So awesome. It's very challenging.

So then you, you know, we fast forward and now you're at Crescat. You kind of started there and talked to me about just what Crescat is all about, you know, you reference more that as kind of a macro focus. Like I said, I had a chance to go through your SEC filings and stuff like that. But just for, you know, the elevator pitch version for everybody else, what what are you guys all about? Well, I guess learning lessons from what happened when I was younger, I think the biggest goal of the firm has been nailing and figuring out identifying the big secular trends and being in front of them and really trying to capitalize from them as best as we can.

And so we also bring expertise when we think it's time to be branching out and and and and starting and whole new strategy. So precious metals is a great example when 22, 2018 we thought this was kind of the right time to be investing in precious metals and we launched a new strategy and that was the separate managed account of precious metals.

And so you know that is completely unbiased and just happens to be the case that also envelop very bullish on tangible assets and and commodities as a whole. And so you know a lot of so basically I think was the idea was figuring out that the quant models that Kevin was building back in the days was leading him to macro views. And so we kind of swaffer and started using the macro models to then confirm those views along with the the the fundamental equity models. And that really helps. And so we were able to build a very diversified portfolio with a lot of you know big macro themes and then we have sub themes within those those big ideas.

So we're one of the few funds that go back to the 90s. And so large cap is our long only strategy that was basically built by selecting companies part of this fundamental equity model. This scores the most liquid companies all over the globe. And we only buy the ones that score at the best and that rank change on a daily basis. And it helps us to manage risk. Okay. But that's one strategy. And then in 2000 we launched the long short. And this was Kevin Smith at the time who was running this. The long short is is you know very few long shorts go back to 2000. It was launched back then because he was very concerned about the equity markets. And he wanted to be flexible and able to short stocks at that time.

We can buy you know affects we can buy commodities and you can really express any of your macro views in any way you would like to. And so that was the beginning of the global macro in 2006 and absolutely nailed the housing bust. And then and then you know from there it did other things such as the oil markets when things turn south or when we had the commodities boom market in 2011 or 2010 and 2011 or we've had shorts in the Chinese markets back in 2015-16. So a lot of themes that played out in our favor since then and in 2018 given the fact that we're so bullish on precious metals we decided to then launch a precious metals focus fund.

    "text": "in our favor since then and in 2018 given the fact that we're so bullish on precious metals we decided to then launch a precious metals focus fund. And then by diving into that industry we figure out as well and we thought that the the best way to be expressing that idea was to be buying with everyone else is not buying which is exploration assets. And so the majority of the industry is really most of the capital has been sucked into the big minors. And so you know there's a lot of issues that we can get into from a macro perspective of why we think the exploration assets are going to be outperforming the entire industry. But that's really a macro trend that we think you know we'll play it out in the following years when it comes to gold and silver prices moving higher and allowing those companies to do very well. So I think that gives you a sense of of how we're basically positioned right now. Yeah definitely and I think that's a great recap. I can tell that you're pretty familiar with running through that stuff because that's very polished. So a following question I have for you is you mentioned really really briefly some of the exploration versus minor stuff which we'll get into in just a minute but I'm just generally curious when you're talking about all of these different funds what what kind of time frames do you all",

We have definitely a more of a long term time framing fact that precious metals fund and the global macro fund have a partial lock up for investors where they can put their money into the funds and they have one year lock up full lock up they cannot take their money out after a year to take 25 after another year to take another 25 they can take the whole and the entire amount that they invested initially. So we're looking for long term investors or go is to you know especially the precious metals thesis where we're dealing with more illiquid assets we have to have it's not just it's the goal is not just to be big is to be big with a bright right type of capital with the right mentality in mindset. So and that is a difficulty is to find long term investors that are willing to take that bet for the next five to 10 years. And so it will depend I would say the most of the big macro themes may take three to five years to play out but there's a lot of sub themes within those",

So I think that gives you a sense of open point if we're getting really you know I guess optimistic about that theme or a certain theme that we think will really play out in the following years. I think you know the whole goal is to be flexible enough to launch a whole new strategy and bring expertise from outside to partner with us and then and then hopefully I hopefully this will be a new business model for Crasket. So I know we don't want to stop just in precious metals we've been doing that with oil but it's not a separate fun it's part of global macro and so right there's a lot more to do here I think.

So I'm just curious about the evolution of the quantitative models to kind of cope with that. Oh my goodness it's been a crazy evolution I mean it as far as you know we've been building models to figure try to figure out the inflation area and you know what is the real attention in the system or or especially where we are in the business cycle I think the correlations change over time and what is the right asset asset connection that you need in order to to perform in this in this environment so it's been it's been a crazy evolution period and I would say the fundamental equity model it's a lot of backtesting it's a lot of backtesting because the majority of the point indicators that have worked in the past most likely will not work in the future and you'll have to kind of link your macro reviews along with the quant views in",
