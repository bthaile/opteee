    "text": "What's up, outliers? Today, we're going to talk about making a backdoor Roth IRA contribution so that you could trade options in your IRA account. So let's talk first about why a Roth versus a traditional. Then we'll talk about why backdoor. And I'm going to give you literally a step-by-step process. I literally just completed mine for the year, so sharing with you for years. So the first thing, why a Roth? Well, a Roth allows for tax free growth of your capital, very similar to a traditional in that sense. However, as compared to traditional, where there's no tax on the contribution with a Roth, you tax on the contribution, but then you are not taxed on the withdrawal. This is useful if you think your income in the future is likely to be higher than it is now. And for a lot of traders that will be the case for people that are working in W2 jobs and stuff like that, probably less. So obviously, consult a tax professional, not a dude on the internet. Next step, why backdoor? Well, it's actually pretty simple. It's because if you fall into some of these various buckets, you literally cannot contribute to a Roth IRA. So for example, if you're single and you make over 161,000, you cannot contribute. If you're married, filed jointly, you cannot contribute. If it's over 240,000, which is kind of a bummer. Because again, for traders and people who invest, there's a good chance",

If it's over 240,000, which is kind of a bummer. Because again, for traders and people who invest, there's a good chance you're going to be worth more in the future than you are today. So this is why we use a backdoor contribution is because it is a legal method for high income earners to contribute to a Roth account. So now let's talk about the steps to complete. It's actually really easy. So the first thing is you're going to make a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. Why is it not deductible? Well, it's for the same reasons that you kind of see over here. If you have a certain amount of income in this case, if you're single and you make over 89K, you can no longer take the deduction on a traditional contribution. So the majority of instances, this is what's going to be the case for people that are doing a backdoor contribution. So you're going to start with a non-deductible contribution, which we'll talk about how to track that a little bit later. It's again very simple. There's essentially two forms that you need. Step two is an optional holding period. I essentially don't really use this. This is some people do it out of a bit of concern trying to reduce their potential footprint",

This is some people do it out of a bit of concern trying to reduce their potential footprint for being flagged. But the reality is it's completely legal to do. And if you accrue any gains while you hold that position, then you run into the pro-radar rule. So once you have your traditional, you make your contribution that's non-deductible, then you once your funds settle, which typically takes a couple days by itself, we convert it to a Roth IRA. If there are no gains on the traditional, then there's no tax on the conversion. If there is or are gains existing or you accrue them in the meantime before you complete the conversion, then you do pay taxes on the gains, but there is no penalty to do so. So it's essentially just going to increase your tax footprint a little bit unnecessarily. Now, the last thing, we report the conversion on our taxes. And there's essentially two forms. There's the IRS form 8606, which is for non-deductible contributions. You literally can just type in IRS form 8606 and it will pop up. And then your broker will send you a form 1099R, which is a conversion notice, essentially, and distributions from retirement accounts. That one comes from your broker. Now, I do not do my",

I haven't for a long time. I have a tax professional that helps me with all this stuff. But what you'll notice is even if you don't do your taxes yourself, it's useful to know these documents, to know the process so that you're aware. So for those that are on Schwab, that's who I use, essentially what you're going to do is initiate a transfer. And you can see when you start the transfer, you're going to say that I want to cash whatever you have in there. And then down here below my head, one second, let me slide me out of the way. Then down further below this, there will be essentially a from account to account. And when you click that, it's going to detect that it is IRA or retirement accounts. So this will pop up at the top. So then all you do is click this here that says to complete the Roth conversion. You click that and then this form pops up. And then essentially you say I want to take it from the traditional.

So typically would be complete because you want to get everything out of the account and then move it into the Roth. And then once you complete that, that's when you get your form 8606 to be able to file that. And that's when you also wait until your broker gives you your 1099 R. So the whole point behind doing this is to be able to move money into your Roth IRA once you get priced out of being able to directly contribute. And this isn't specific for options trading. I do trade options in my IRA accounts. However, this is for anybody that's trying to get money into your Roth IRA. This process is about the same. So if there's any questions on how this works, let me know. Be an outlier. I'll see you all later.",
