There is a period of time where it's painful. You're holding something that's losing money. It's uncomfortable, but notice how I'm trading IWM. I've never seen any sort of US base for odd market index not make new highs at some point. So if my hypothesis in that change eventually, sure, I would take a loss, no problem. But this isn't Japan. Japan is that scenario where they still haven't made new highs. But if we zoom all the way out, this is going back essentially to the inception of IWM. We've never not made new highs at some point in time.",
