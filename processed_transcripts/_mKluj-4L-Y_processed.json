So for those that don't know, I just wrapped up a stream not too long ago with my friend PB talking about the tariffs and stuff like that. And then now we are going to take a closer look at the markets, see what's coming up this week and all that kind of stuff. So let's see who we got in the chat. Oh, I got to make sure that I text Mel and her know that the dog has been fed. Just so that he doesn't get fed twice, become a little fat boy. No way. Looks like we got Tommy Lauren Reese Shamgar H travel. Great to see all of the usual names and faces. Lauren says 2030 is Eric's sick. What's going on? No, I did a live stream before this. So I actually didn't even know if we were going to do one today, but I just slid it a little bit later so that we had a chance to connect really. I just want to make sure that you all are good to be completely honest. I, we can look through the markets and stuff like that, but I know for a lot of people stuff is a little bit hectic right now. So it's mostly honestly doing this",

So it's mostly honestly doing this just to make sure everybody's like comfortable portfolio is not a flame. We're not freaking out stuff like that because that's unnecessary and that's a bad vibe. So let's get me on the main screen and let us get started. So we'll start with a quick overview of the broad markets, not the futures. I just want to do all the sectors and give everybody a rundown. So you can see comms did well, materials did well, energy is still contracting, financials down tick but holding, industrials rolling over, technology is, look at this technology is still looking so rough. Now one of the things I want to highlight very, very specifically here is the relative strength between communication services and then XLK, right? You see the difference here. XLK is actually slightly negative sloping at this point, whereas communication services is hovering near highs. So what this tells you is that not all tech is created equal at the moment and there are some of them that are doing really, really well and there are some of them that are not doing well.

So a great example of that is if we pop over into this we go into comm services, because we can see meta is been doing typically pretty well. Let's grab meta really quick. So meta is hovering near highs. Just had banger earnings. We look at Google, Google is also crushing. If you look at T-Mobile, not very good, good earnings but not very good. Take a look at Netflix, covering near highs, really solid earnings, Disney, trending sideways here, not much to write home about. Same thing as T-Mobile for ATT and then Verizon about the same. So if you boil this down to like what's really leading the sector, you can kind of see it clear as day. It's essentially these three companies, well two companies realistically. Google, Google L, which will be just about the same and then meta. That's what's propping up comm services. And if you're looking for strength and tech, this is not a bad place to look. Now if we go into IT specifically, IT is just rough right now. So rough. Now one thing I do want to know is that Nvidia is literally crazy enough. Nvidia is becoming a value zone. Nvidia now is trading at less than 0.3 peg ratio to earnings growth. That is",

Nvidia now is trading at less than 0.3 peg ratio to earnings growth. That is seen almost like a holy grail, peg less than one. There are literally entire strategies built around peg less than one. I've traded some of them. So this is now literally a value play. And I still don't have direct exposure into Nvidia because I'm trading it through cues and stuff like that. But it starts to look really appealing here. Now if you'll recall when we covered this gap previously, the drop down, one of the first things I told you guys is with stuff like this, I prefer to wait and see how it behaves. And I still haven't redrawn this topside alert. The bottomside alert got triggered because it fell below. But what I'm highlighting is that Nvidia based sideways and then it fell off a cliff. Now it's again kind of in in no man's land, which the question is how far down does this feel like going, but there's not a lot of support and resistance here. So that overall perspective is really interesting to me because I think Nvidia at this point is just really, really strong. And I still am in favor of waiting to see how it behaves.

But it starts to look more and more interesting. Nvidia literally at this point is becoming near value play, which is kind of insane actually to even speculate because of how big and how transformative of a company Nvidia is. So that's looking within the tech sector, but broader tech right now is looking really, really gross. So let's now take a look. We already did the events that are coming up this week and all that kind of stuff. So I'm going to skip over that. We did that yesterday. But I want to continue cruising through a little bit of this grid and see if anything else sticks out to us again, just to recap what we just talked about. The thing that sticks out to me here is the divergence between communication services and tech. And then within communication services, where the strength lies and then within it where the weakness lies, that's the key takeaway from that section. Now, if we take a look down here and we look at staples, they still don't look good. Real estate does not look good. Utilities still doesn't look good at an update, but still doesn't look good.

It looks like it's now not quite, but it's now flirting with this three month point of control. So that's starting to look strong. My guess is if we look within healthcare, there will be pockets of very specific strength. And then if we take a look at discretionary discretionary, it's still massively outpacing staples. Who to thunk it? Not me. Okay. Now over to bar chart. And I want to take a look at the overall market performance with you all. So big declines on the day we can see we're rotating down heavy on net new highs and lows, which is not totally surprising. If we take a look at here, you can see that that's also represented for the NASDAQ in New York Stock Exchange. So net lows across the board and decelerating gross highs. And then the advanced decline cumulative average for the New York Stock Exchange, it's above this, it's above the 50 day MA, but it's negative sloping and the 50 day MA was just starting to turn around.

So let's take a look now at overall market performance, any key divergences here, this materials materials is breaking down, healthcare is breaking down, financials is breaking down, financials is interesting. And we just talked about healthcare before too, that healthcare, we think might have some pocketed strength. So let's see what the dealio is in healthcare. We'll sort it by a five day change. MHC, MHR is tellapsing. Oh, oh, oh. Very interesting. So interesting. So here I actually kind of favor this heavily to the downside, but it just it's fallen so far that it's essentially out of references. You have to go out three years before you find the next reference area of anything resembling the port and resistance. Oops, didn't mean to do that. I mean, the next volume node is right here at 211, but it's a small volume node. So this might be a continuation fade play. This is contracting heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy contraction in the HR and then mRNA coming into earnings, doing terribly on a five day, ALGN is next.

So then now the question is within healthcare, what's doing well because there are clearly pockets of strength. So IDXX had really good earnings, ABV, also a good earnings. So most of this is on reaction to earnings and then obviously VRT expert techs had that great release on that new non opioid pain drug. So this is leading well into earnings. My expectation is this will probably continue to drift up. So this might actually become another upside. Another upside play actually. So let's take a look at the options here. Yeah, people are playing heavy upside 21,000 against 13,000. How is it positioned for earnings on the 10th? Let's take a look at the cycle that includes earnings. Not a lot of exposure there, but double the call side and then on the front side in 21 feb still double the call side. So this looks like a bullish opportunity. I have to add this to my list of laundry list of. This is of your TX. All right, so now let's circle back a little bit to the conversation I was having earlier with. With Peruvian bull and I want to talk about it from the perspective of like. How can we actively profit from what's going on from this trade war and other terrif where I should say",

So if I grab just some general news. Here. And we take a peek. The terrifs went into place on Saturday. One day there was talk then about retaliation interesting from Canada. And then today earlier in the day, Mexico said, hey, we'll send 10,000 troops to the border to help secure the border from our side. Let's sit down and talk and Trump was like, okay. He put on a 30 day stay for Mexico. Obviously this stuff with Canada is still on the docket. Then later today, Canada and I should say Trudeau specifically. But Trudeau had a conversation with Trump in the morning. And the reason why I'm highlighting this specifically is because of the two conversation element to it, which is interesting. The fact that Canada had to have two conversations about this where Trump had one with Mexico as far as we know. And it looks like he got to an agreement with Mexico pretty fast. Now with Canada took two calls, but then they also struck a deal. So here's what this looks like. And we talked about this",

My original expectation here is not that these terrifs were designed from an economic purpose. Like that's not what it seemed like at all. This seemed like a really aggressive and honestly slightly advanced negotiation tactic. And it relies heavily on the US relative position of strength compared to both Mexico and Canada in terms of our trade relationships. And part of me thinks that Trump is doing a lot of this stuff to try and accelerate as much as it can. The key items that he's trying to push quickly. Because by doing it this way, by launching the tariffs first to show that he's not fucking around. And that now the ball is in your court and the clock is ready taking because this is happening. It adds a completely different layer of expediency behind everybody's interactions with that thing. And I think that's also why he agreed to a 30 day thing because realistically if he was trying to be unreasonable, he would say no, you guys have 48 hours, 72 hours, you guys have a week to come back to us.

Now what concessions are going to have to be made and all that kind of stuff that I'm still really interested in like for Canada, like what specifically would Canada have to say in order for Trump to be satiated. One of the things that I posted this in the discord earlier clearly was Trump wanting US banks to be able to operate in Canada. And that's a that is a fair gripe from the US perspective because inner banking relationships is a really big deal. And right now Canada does have obviously a complete stranglehold on banking within Canada from domestic companies. And again, that obviously benefits Canada, but that's something that Trump has identified as an issue that he's willing to fight for. And this is obviously part of his his agenda with them, but I don't know what else because he hasn't talked about what else is you guys know I've been following this very closely.

Now the directional moves and stuff like that we already talked about all that ad nauseam yesterday and then I also talked about that on the podcast I did earlier with PB essentially trading the original release of the tariffs was very simple, it's just a directional play. Then it was trend following trimming risk adding risk that kind of thing. Then as of today when it looked like Mexico was arriving at an agreement that clearly signified that this is not really designed to stay in place. And if you remember on what was it? Yeah, yesterday's Sunday when we talked about this I even made the comment that it doesn't look like the futures market is taking this that seriously. And we can also see it from a volatility perspective. So my overarching hypothesis here is that the market already saw this and could see most of this price then I think a lot of what we saw was just short term positioning rightfully so depending on how this thing goes now.

But the big question now my opinion comes down to does this continue so here's the way I'm trading it going forward I am being very very mindful depending on what news comes out between now and the 30 day update. And then if the 30 day update comes up and it looks like the tariffs are going back on then sure let's go back on if it looks like that's not the case then I probably wouldn't trade it necessarily to the upside because I don't think that there's going to be a massive upside shock from prices if it is held off and I already have net long delta's in the portfolio now from the model portfolio I've been sharing with you all I did trim a little bit of I bit yesterday. And I had a thousand shares at I forgot what the basis was but now I have 800 shares at a basis of 53 74 so I sold 200 shares a big reason for that was literally just to pair off a little bit of near term risk depending on how far crypto currencies continue to move. And I'm still 43 utilized but I wanted to add a little more risk in short puts to kind of play the down move. So that leads us to where we are now we have about maybe 10 minutes left so I'm happy to talk about",

The main thing that I'm very interested in game stop for well there's a few key reasons the first key reason is it literally is like.

Put aside the main thing that game stop is really interesting from the lens of analyzing and assessing market behavior. The reason why that's so interesting is because game stop is a insanely insanely great example of how markets can be manipulated to a pretty significant degree and it puts it on full blast. So that's why I'm very interested in game stop not only is the stock itself interesting but the people that are around the stock from again a CEO perspective from big investor perspective or in kitties probably the largest retail trader that exists so. For somebody like him to do what he does in that stock is fascinating and then it's also an incredible vector to learn about market structure market microstructure and a lot of the plumbing side of things so that's why.

Explanation of it yet to be completely honest but I'm also interested in it now if we think of it from a general perspective why would you move shares of anything not just game stop but why would you move assets from from an entity in L. C. into your personal name well the first reason is you're trying to de conflict what assets that L. L. C. holds. That could be for a number of reasons there's essentially no big difference in terms of ownership or ability to leverage the assets the main reason why you would make that changes if you're trying to de conflict the holdings within the L. C. You're planning on essentially pulling the L. C. down and you're getting the assets out of it I am curious if that might be the case but yeah I haven't seen anything directly on it.

I think I think the reason why you see that is because change takes a long time and there are a lot of things that have to change like for example the the amendment to reg show that came out that now requires entities essentially to show their short holdings like that's actually kind of pertinent here and. How well that's adhered to and how big of a deal that is that's honestly a completely different story I'm not exactly super bullish on that to be honest but nonetheless it is something that's at least happening so yeah I generally think the reason is change takes a long time there's a lot of really strong players in place that don't want to see the change made there's probably exceedingly active negative incentives being placed for that change.

So they definitely could be tariffed but the the main thing I think about anyways is the relationship between all this stuff so if we think of a company here and this company is what's one of the examples you did you didn't have flex. So Netflix the primary way Netflix makes money is by the customers well if overall tariffs that are in place over here these are now documents instead of a building these are tariffs. And if these tariffs lead to an increase of anything from 500 to 1,000 in monthly spending. For consumers that trickles back into this customers budget so as they're looking at their budget. For this month they need to figure out what line items are going to come off. And typically stuff like this is pretty high on that come off item list especially with the recent price likes in Netflix.

So even though the tariffs that you see aren't directly being reflected here in something like Netflix even in their current state there's still going to be a trickle down effect that's going to come from the spending capacity and the overall capability that consumers have to spend money. So indirect effect but still direct effect for sure now that actually reminds me in a completely strange but different way. I wanted to show you all something that I caught earlier today and started trading. Was it. No. Damn it I can't remember the fucking ticker. Oh I think this might be it. Yeah so this is a really really interesting ticker so if you take a look it does have options it's really really a liquid which is actually an important point here. But I came across this a little while ago and the reason why I didn't really talk about it much is because I actually didn't want to draw too much attention to it but now I'm not really trading it like this but it had some news come out late last year. And then I started noticing this really really picky behavior in B. K. E. and this is a really really interesting ticker to keep an eyeball on from a volatility perspective because",

So others actually that came across came across the same scenario this is not it. This is not it. Damn it there is one other I wanted to show you guys. No that's not it. I remember it. It started with a B as well. Don't remember. Might have been on one of my other alerts but anyways the broader point that I wanted to highlight for you is that over the last six to nine months I've come across actually quite a few tickers that are showing signs of some short slash gamma squeezing. So it's something that I've been trading and paying attention to a little more heavily but this I wouldn't consider this one of them I just don't remember what the ticker was to be honest with you.

Anyways back to Reese recess him's they have high short interest can you tell of price action is shorts covering or natural price discover you can't really tell. It's very difficult to directly reflect that. This doesn't look like shorts covering now there definitely will be shorts covering in the process of this. But the way to think about shorts covering is you're normally going to see really big peaky candles. So actually a great example of that is game stop. So when there's actually a short squeeze that's on. You'll notice that these candles shoot up huge relative to the body and then they come back down or the overall size of the candle itself is absolutely massive on a percentage basis compared to recent price action. So for example this candle right here that it did end up closing near the top. The high low price is 47 and a half low of 31 so that's literally a 16 point spread. So when we look at him's they're definitely are going to be shorts covering in here. But it's not like causing a short squeeze",

So when we look at him's they're definitely are going to be shorts covering in here. But it's not like causing a short squeeze there just people that are on the wrong side of the trade that are closing out the positions. And the reason being is again take a look at the overall high low spread here highest 39 low is 35. So it's a big move but it's nothing like people being forced to close from again like a standard short squeeze or something like that. So. Re says I found it wild. Hems ignored all market sentiment the last couple trading days. Yeah well that's the nature of idiosyncratic risk is that there will be things internal to individual names. That lead them to do what they want to do we actually looked at a couple of these earlier right meta another prime example meta couldn't have cared less about the whole tear of picture it literally showed zero signs of slowing down didn't care. Google didn't care at all so this is the nature of idiosyncratic risk is we can find things that become decoupled from the broader market. Typically not indefinitely but generally for specific periods of time and again that's just because there's a different risk profile associated with them they have individual news that impacts the name",

Sweet. If anybody else says one more we could do one more alright Chris says was there any specific reason Jimmy was trading at 34 just a few weeks ago only to get beaten down a 2589 now nobody knows. So the short answer to that question and this isn't meant to be like annoying or anything like that it's just the general answer is that during this period more people are accumulating into it and then from here less people are accumulating which is a lot. And then you can see that there's a lot of accumulating which is allowing the sales to kind of push it down pretty heavy. That's kind of what this is so the reasons behind it. There's tons of them but the interesting thing about the price movement that you see in GameStop is that this hasn't really been news driven by much of anything so that parts been very very interesting to me the price behavior of GameStop on a relative basis it's not",

So this is a really important level that it's budding up against as you can see all these lines have already been on the chart. But like this movement here this simply means there were people that started selling and why they started selling it could be people that were deep in profit it could be people that if we zoom out. It could be people that bought in over here and they were just so thankful to be able to get the fuck out at close to a break even there's a million different reasons now what I can tell you is that this was broadly supported though meaning we can see the spike in volume as it's going down so this is definitely from an institutional element how much of it we don't know but this definitely will be partially will not partially largely driven by institutional offload but even still the offload itself was just very one sided.

It just means that there were people that were wanting to buy into it so this is very just one side of volume most of the day. So yeah a little bit of a different price behavior but the cliff notes version for all that is nobody knows anybody that says they do is full shit the structural reason is because there are less people buying and we can analyze the price movements to come up with some ideas as to why it might be moving the way it is so in this case. It looks like there are less buyer stepping in and it looks like there's a slight uptick in selling so now it does look like though that the stock is in a really precarious spot in my opinion so if I take a look at the coverage of the sample portfolio our basis is 28.21 which is not good and we're like 78 utilized which is also not good so the cash component of this is a little bit too",

And then I will likely buy some of the shares outright and it's just because of where the where the price is currently sitting. So yeah really interesting behavior here though no no dots about it sweet all right gang that wraps me up for today I will catch all the outlier pros on the stream tomorrow if you guys need anything hit me up in the discord be an outlier we'll see you all later. you",
