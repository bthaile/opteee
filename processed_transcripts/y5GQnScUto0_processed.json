You know we have to talk about GameStop. And it's because take a look at this big giant candle for today. Here we are plugging along, just cruising along, actually hit a low at the day, 2016, 15, at 10, 15, Pacific time. And then we get to 10, 45. And what do you notice at 10, 45, Pacific time? He saw it. He's actually the one that called it out. What we see is a massive candle emerged from the ocean. We had a low on this candle of 26, 27 and a high of 30. Yeah. 10 plus percent move on a single candle within 15 minutes. That typically happens on some pretty big news. Take a look at the volume. Volume is mellow, mellow, mellow, mellow, mellow. And then boom, massive volume. So what happened in this time period? You know what happened? Boom. The cat returns yet again. Now, as most of you hopefully know by now, I am like a humble trader. I do not know all of the ins and outs of all these different memes and what they mean. I actually have no clue. That's your expertise and that's what I lean on. You all for to help me with to understand what this might mean. I don't know.",

Obviously the time thing is very specific. We have 420 and time 420 joke and then 109. That's 69 seconds and casals are wondering. So 69 420 just playing games there. That's what I see. I don't know how accurate that is and I don't know what this means. I also don't know anything about time. Maybe he's just wanting you to look at the time. I don't know any of that.

Let's come into a one minute time frame and 1045. Again, so within 60 seconds volume expands from 93,000 the candle before to 1.8 million in 60 seconds. What I want to highlight here is that ever so clearly is not retail. That's not retail that did this. This isn't the people on X. It's not the people on Superstank or other communities that saw this and jumped into the fray within 60 seconds driving up volume to 1.8 million. This highlights the thing a lot of people in GameStop talk about and a lot of people that are external to the GameStop story will kind of look at it and say like, yeah, whatever. And clearly this is automation. There's algorithms that are ever so clearly watching everything that happens on his accounts and front running perspective move. And they were correct. Whatever things were doing this were correct. So let's actually zoom this in even more because it's kind of fascinating to me. So that's within a five minute time frame. We come in here to a one minute time frame. Let's take a look. Let's take a look at the zoom in a little bit.

And again, right at that 10 45 handle of that 1.8 million that I told you about in the five minute candle. In this one minute candle, it's 1.5 million shares that moved. And for context, the one minute candles before you can look at the volume 20 and the volume five preceding it. The volume five is 319,000. That's the average number of shares over the prior five and 20 minute periods. Meanwhile, this 20 minute period is 1.5 million. Huge, huge move. And it all happened insanely fast. So that is something I think is generally known that I don't think this is breaking any new ground. But it's something that I do feel like traders absolutely have to be aware of. And the reason why I think it's so important for retail traders to be aware of this is because if a retail trader starts to see this kind of movement, the fervor is generally strong and people really want to get in as fast as they can. And most of the retail traders that I know, they're people that still work normal jobs. They're trying to get in on their coffee break or whatever. And they're not going to catch this news instantaneously like this is. They're going to catch this news five minutes late, ten minutes late, half hour",

They're going to catch it now during this video. And the problem there is by that time, so much price action has already occurred driven by automation that by the time retail starts to get in, sometimes it can start reversing and selling off. So if you think of the person that checked in on their lunch break and they got in at 1155 Pacific time, well, they really saw a rally from 30 to 30 and 76 cents and then all the way back down to 28. So I just want that message to be known that it's good to be excited. It's good to be quick and react to news. It's just unfolding, but there's just very clear signs of automation in here. You're not going to outpace that. So you have to be kind of judicious in your entry selections here. Because if you're trying to play the really short term moves that happen like this, you're late to the punch almost inherently just being a retail trader.

And I watched this stuff like Hawk. And I got alerts and stuff like that. It takes me a few seconds to open up devices, log in, whatnot. And it's not instantaneous. So just keep that in mind. Because it's always a bummer for me to see people getting caught with these really high-cost basis on a relative level because of this kind of thing. But it is something to keep an eyeball on. That's for sure. So the price today was great. And I even talked about this before. I think the price to pass couple days has been great. Even though there's these down moves that doesn't scare me. That's normal price movement in a stock. You need to see it because there has to be an exchange of supply and demand.

So what are we seeing here? Well, the first thing I can tell you is the front volatility jacked. Absolutely jacked. It was over 270 earlier when I made a post on X. I don't know if you call it Xing or tweeting on X. Do you X on X? I don't know what it's I don't know what it is, but doing the thing on X. This was over 270 and you can see this front expiration is so heavy. My guess is the market probably saw that there wasn't massive buying behavior that they thought could have been him, which we'll talk about. Now there was tremendous call volume today. Massive call volume. There is 495,000 calls traded against 91,000 puts. So huge, huge, huge call volume. And the overwhelming majority of that volume as expected is in the 6D and 13D time frames. The reason why that's as expected is because whenever we see something like this go on, everybody plays the front expiration almost always.

So this was pairing down as people were moving out in expirations, but today people are just dog piling it massive amounts of people, 60,000 volume here. So big, big, big short term expectations from people. And we've seen this before. Yeah, what we'll kind of see how it goes. The thing that I kind of key into from a longer term time frame is I like to look. The move up into this has been pretty strong. We had a high volume day today, which is always a big thing to keep an eyeball on. But it's still a little early in my opinion to make any big decisions about whether or",

But it's still a little early in my opinion to make any big decisions about whether or not we think that there's going to be a massive continuation here or not. That normally takes a few days to transpire. Right. So you can see this even back during these prior expansion periods, where volume went from 8.6 to 36. So massive volume expansion. And then it's still, you know, trend its sideways for a little bit before rocket shipping up and out. So this is like really, really early days in my opinion to try to identify if anything's going on here. So back into the rest of the options though. And I wanted to take a look at TNS time and sales see if anything really stuck out to me there. And let me show you this. When I first, when I first posted this and I actually think I can grab it on X from my account here. I first posted this and you can see when I posted this, this was at 1109 Pacific time. I was sorting by premium and the largest premium trades here were 100,000 in change. So that's when I first saw this and I thought, okay, so not like a massive move going on here just yet still kind",

We did see some really, really big trades come in, but a lot of them are at the bid. So we have people in 17 Jan 25 still 43 days left to go. And these are people that almost assuredly are taking these down on pretty big profit because there was a nice big run today. I was fortunate I had covered calls not covered as you all know it's always at a ratio for me, but I had short calls against the long shares that I took off as soon as I saw that news because they were still on profit. I didn't want to get ran over to the upside, which I was pleased that I did. So lots of people are just managing positions that they're holding on days like this to kind of see how the dust settles. But most of the bigger trades that we saw today look like unwinds as I would fully expect there's a little over a half million dollar trade, 287,000 trade here.

So big people unwinding in terms of people occurring not as big, but this one stuck out to me big time. 771 days to expiration the 55 calls super far out of the money from where it sits now and this is a quarter million dollar trade. Just very interesting and this is one I'm going to keep an eyeball on this popped on an alert for me for volume over OI. But I thought that that was real curious. Most of the other trades today were either take a look at this. We see another 771 day this was 155,000 and then we have some short term these are on the buy sides for these calls 22 days expiration 15 days expiration. So these are people playing front moves expected front moves eight days eight days is all super short term time frames. So this is interesting to see, but there's nothing jumping out at me from an options trading perspective. That's like yeah, okay, something huge is going on here.

I was wondering why the volume wasn't there. I meant to click this. I was like where did everything go. That's right here. So as we look back through the the rest of this week, there is definitely some bigger trades, but just overall lighter premium sizing. And this has been the case for weeks now. We're still seeing things over 100,000 pretty regularly, but nothing nothing to know where they in my opinion. So very, very fun. I'm very curious to know what you all think the the post was today. What that was all about. It doesn't look like there's crazy options activity going on in here just yet. We know that there was a lot of stock activity going on without a doubt because volume shot up as people were trading, but we have to see where it goes from here. So let me know what you think the tweet or X was all about and then also where you think price is going from here. And you'd be close above 30 tomorrow. That's the big",
