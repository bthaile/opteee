    "text": "Was that option bought or sold? One of the things you can do is a retail option's traders pay very close attention to order flow and see if anything sticking out to you. I actually had a trade that I reviewed today on that exact concept. However, what we do is we take a guess. So if we take a look at the call volume and the put volume above my head here in GM, we can see what percentage traded at the bid or at the offer. Things that trade at the bid, we typically associate that with a sale and things that trade at the offer. We typically associate with a buy. And I find it really interesting here because a lot of people think that this is definitive, but it's not. We don't know conclusively if an option trades at the bid that it is a sale. We assume that it is, but there are extraneous circumstances where it could be a buy if it shifted during the course of the trade. There's a lot of weird little quirks like that. Although they are the exception not the rule, it's pretty solid otherwise being out of sale later.",
