    "text": "large group of people but there's a larger group of people down here so really interesting overall price behavior I'm really eager to see how it moves this week uh my positions in here always transparent about that I still love shares I have short calls that are now underwater that I'm going to have to manage that's no problem and then I traded this move here so I bought more options a little near dated um than the other option trades that I already have on that are out in April these are just out in like January and these are still on so I'll stay into these essentially and I'm just sliding the stop up so that's all there is to it now if we take a look at the options chain really quick let's take a look at total oi we have 567,000 calls against 218,000 puts so still massive call skue and the one thing that stuck out to me during the live stream was this the near-term options chain is all sorts of messed up now notice how much that already aligned if you watch the video from Saturday compar it to here this is already a massive normalization it makes way more sense here so now it's looking like in uh 20 DS the 23s are at like 104.6 per V against the 15 noves which are like 9 8 so that closed almost 10 points this was really interesting because that was so",
