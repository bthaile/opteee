I started trading in 2007 and have spent over 30,000 hours honing my skillset. Like many, I came from a single mom who struggled - yet I became a multi-millionaire in my early 30s.\n\nI\u2019ve no secret tricks or \"easy money\" strategies. I carefully studied, planned, tracked results, and optimized my performance - and I openly share my journey. \n\nI built the Outlier Community to connect you with other driven people who are disinterested in average and focused on creating their optimal futures. It's a holistic community, centered on creating financial freedom and living a fulfilling life. From investing basics, options trading, stock market analysis, portfolio management to real estate investing, wealth development, psychology, discipline, fitness, etc. None of us find success solely on our own - here we create it together.
