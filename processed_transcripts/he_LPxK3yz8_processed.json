Now my return for last year, I've already told you it landed at 92.22 and that now takes my, this should be 17 years. That was my 17th full year, no 18th full year of trading. My bad, 18 years of trading. Damn, that's kind of not, says it. That's, that's crazy. Sorry, I just another year prepped up on it. That's crazy. So 18th full year of trading. So that takes my compound annual growth rate over the 18 years to 31.6 that is primarily skewed from the last two years. So if I update this really quick to give you what it would be sub those two years, it would be 20.35. That's getting rid of the 118 return from last year and then the 92 from this year. If I change those really fast, well, 118 from the primary and it was a little bit over that. It was like 172, which was a significant change. But the overall return eye track it as 118, which is the primary output from general trading activities. But change both of those to 15 out of curiosity. That would take my compound annual growth rate to 22.5. So these",

But change both of those to 15 out of curiosity. That would take my compound annual growth rate to 22.5. So these last two years have single-handedly skewed my entire compound annual growth rate trading performance. Now, the reason why that matters is I want to give you a couple examples. And if we go to the website, which hopefully you all are enjoying the tools that are on here. And if we go to the compound interest calculator, and we take a look at somebody that's starting with 25,000, let's say that they're saving 2,000 per month. And let's say that they're looking at this for a 20-year time span. If they have a benchmark return and let's say the SP 500, instead of being 8, this is a little bit dated, let's say the SP 500 is like 11. And then let's say that you actually return 20 on average. The difference here is massive, right? So if we compare to the benchmark return over this time frame, the benchmark would have returned you 1.7 million. The 20 that you might be able to return would pull you at 5.4 million. So you double and change what the SP 500 would give you. This is what trading is about. This is exactly why we do what we do.

Now, there's nothing wrong with that 1.7 million dollars that you might earn in spy. And then once you get rid of taxes and stuff like that, it's a great return. But significantly less than what you can make being even a solid trader, not a perfect trader, not the best trader, a solid trader. And that's what this is, right? That's why I use 20. You'll find traders all the time that outperform this. And I always will bring that to your attention because the pool of potential is very, very deep. So if we take a look, this doesn't look like it's updated, but it'll still serve the purpose. Yeah, this is only through 30 now. They don't have through DCAT. So this is looking at the US investing championship. And let's take a look at the returns here. So this is 11 month returns.

You'll find this to be the case actually pretty regularly, which is always interesting to me that when people have derivatives included that they tend to do worse than equities. And I just find that fascinating. Then the actual stock division, 20,000 accounts, I honestly don't care that much about because it's much easier to scale a very small account like this. But you can see that there's somebody literally with almost a thousand percent return, right? Crazy. Then if we go down to the derivative side of things still for very small accounts, 20K, 610. So then if we typically hold on, where's the, where's the rest of this? There's another, those bullshit. So for those that don't know, there's another bucket.

If you do not have a distinct target that you're shooting at, then you tend to hit all over the place, kind of randomness, right? And this is from a shooting perspective.

And I genuinely believe newer traders don't get to pick what their return is going to be. The reason why newer traders don't get to pick is because newer traders don't even know what they're capable of producing yet. So if you don't know what you're capable of producing, you picking something doesn't make any sense. So a lot of what I'm talking about here is from the perspective of slightly more seasoned traders that have a little bit of a track record that they can lean on and use as a planning factor. If you are a new trader, my position for that cohort is a little bit different. And I believe newer traders should focus way more on a fundamental level of first, be profitable. Make greater than zero dollars. I genuinely believe that is likely the target that will keep you from blowing yourself up until you're at a point that you can scale it, which is a thing. You will be able to scale it at some point. But right in the beginning, it's very difficult to scale something based",

But right in the beginning, it's very difficult to scale something based on a skill set that you don't really know whether or not you have. So one of the biggest issues newer traders will base is they'll say I want x return. And that's fine and dandy. The problem with just randomly saying I want x return is you may or may not be able to achieve it. So if you focus first on simply trying to be profitable for your first couple of years, seeing what the skill set looks like, seeing what you're capable of producing, then you're in a much better spot to come up with an informed decision. Dan says I used to watch this other YouTuber who swore by taking profit as soon as it hits 10, which doesn't make any sense. I would easily pick apart that framework. It doesn't make any sense. But that's just for one trade rather than an cumulative total for a period of time. Yeah, that doesn't make any sense whatsoever. So the problem with coming up with arbitrary targets like that is it's completely insensitive to the expected return for the strategy. So picking an arbitrary thing of 10 is just that. It's completely arbitrary. And you run into",

A lot of times it's because we want to realize a gain. We like the process of realizing a game. So yeah, I would argue that that is not logical. That's just not a solid route to take. Again, there's a way that taking small profits can work. I'm not crashing out and saying small profits never make sense or anything like that. I'm just saying picking a defined something like that doesn't really make sense. And Riz says you'll never land in a pp like that. That's literally an exact point.

So the interesting part is that if you don't apply an overly greedy approach to maintaining the exposure that you want, when you use leveraged tickers like this, you can use less of your money up front, which then gives you way more flexibility as the underlying moves. So say for example, we got spy when it was 100. Let's just say all of these are 100. And we wanted to use all of the money to maintain the correct exposure. Well, in this scenario, we use all of our money, we buy it at 100. So that means as it moves around, it doesn't really matter that much because you're using all of your money. So if it goes down, you can't scale in because you've used the money.

So now, if we look at this in SSO, and the underlying starts to go down, guess what we can do, we can scale in on the way down because we're using less money. We have 50,000 that we can then apply to the strategy as something goes down if we're not automatically defaulting to the same dollar amount up front. This is a way to use leveraged ETFs to reduce your risk. Reduce your risk. So what I mean by that is let's say spy goes down by 30 as a 30 drop. So in this case, we have this minus this times this, this, and we're going to lock this. So in this scenario, if we have a 30 decline in total, the dollar amount that you can lose will look very different depending on the actual decline because these would also have two times the move here. So this becomes this, and then this becomes this. So you can see in this scenario, you're still losing way more money if you take something like this, straight punch to the face, and you hold it all the way down. You lose a lot more money. In this case, you only lose your 30K. In",

So you're using way more of your money and the total amount that you can lose as a gross dollar amount will be very static. So the interesting part in terms of what you're actually losing, you're losing way more of the total amount of money you have out. So if we do this as a percentage, you're down 90 of your money here. If you do this as a percentage, you're down 50, 60 of your money here. But as a total gross dollar amount, you're not really any worse off because we're sizing the position based on what it represents, rather than the overall same dollar amount invested.

So if you're trying to figure out what you want to do longer term, then now is the exact time to have that defined for the year. IR2BAD can says sounds like 9-6-Sorta. Yeah, I don't know much about the 9-6 strategy, but for my understanding, it looks just like a leveraged ETF trend following approach. So yeah, because the thing that is really important, I think, when it comes to managing a strategy like this is overlaying it with Shannon's demon, which we talked about actually on the live stream previously, with something like, with Peruvian pull and something like Shannon's demon can help reduce overall volatility pretty massively through a rebalancing protocol. So what that means is as these eventually go up, what we would do is take some of the money out to trim our exposure back to what we want the exposure to be. And then we can scale it. So let's use not even numbers now and do 200,000. So if you have 200,000 that you want to run into something like this, then you have to use all 200,000 up front for this. You're on a 30 drawdown, you expect a risk 60, but for us to sell, you need to use 100K, you pro, you need to use 66K to maintain this",

The point I'm trying to make is when you have it start going in your favor, you can rebalance to maintain the same dollar exposure that you actually want to keep. And if you maintain the correct dollar exposure for the underlying itself, then you can balance your risk, pull some of your risk off so that when we eventually get the down move, you're not actually risking any sort of significant premium over what the other account is. And then you can still maintain some of the upside potential, depending on how you scale on and stuff. So it's one of the really cool things when it comes to leveraged ETFs, they can reduce risk. But they have to be used really, really responsibly. One of the main things that you get to benefit from and why there's so fantastic for something like the coverage triangle is because a big part of the coverage triangle is scaling protocols. That under would underperform the underlying itself, unless you're in a sideways market, slightly down trending market, then the coverage triangle would outperform.

And it's because you have capital that's not being utilized to maintain the exposure. So for part of my portfolio, I will continue to run the coverage triangle in Upro and T triple Q's. I'm also running it. I think, yeah, I'm running it in Ibit. And then I also started it with GameStop. So I have a handful of the coverage triangles on right now. But that's the overall game plan currently. Australia says, how are you dealing with option liquidity on SSO and Upro? Liquidity doesn't matter really that much. So I'm not trading SSO. And SSO is I would argue better for people that just want to be uninvolved, meaning you don't want to trade it that much. Because the liquidity in SSO is entirely circumnavigable via something like the coverage triangle because there's just not that many round trips that are associated. Whereas via Upro, definitely more liquid. And it allows slightly more active management to be applied without taking as much out via friction. But the coverage triangle itself isn't really that high touch of strategy. That's the whole purpose of it. It's why I built the strategy the",

But the coverage triangle itself isn't really that high touch of strategy. That's the whole purpose of it. It's why I built the strategy the way I did is because it's designed to give me market beta with a slightly enhanced return profile that's not high touch that allows me to also realize gains as we move along. So I think in here, I show you the GameStop. Coverage triangle is from the video yesterday. One of the things that I wanted to show you was this here. Where GameStop itself is, I think it was up like 26 and 29 respectively when I first looked at this. So the difference here though is if we take a look at GameStop, even how the coverage triangle is performing right now, one of the things that the position has, which hold on, I'm actually, this is missing this. I was wondering what was wrong with this. This should be W. It's because I copied this over 12, 233. So one of the things that this has going in at its favor, the coverage triangle versus just holding the shares in GameStop on a comparative basis, is there's, oh, that's why hold on, I'm sorry. These are wrong. This should be 19. I have to get rid of the lock for when I copy and paste this",

The main difference here though is for the coverage, what the the coverage triangle as it's designed doesn't rely just on unrealized gains. It also allows me to benefit from realized gains. If this number calls me back, I'm going to pick it up just because I have no idea who it is or what it is or why they're continuing to call. So primary difference. GameStop here, if you're holding the shares, you're doing well. You're up 30 over this comparative time frame, but all of that is unrealized gain. If you look at it from the coverage triangle perspective, you have, albeit very small, but you do have a, you do have a realized gain, which is great. Oh, this is finally from Bear Canada. I'll call them back in a little bit. They've already pissed me off, so I'll deal with them in a little bit. So yeah, that's one of the really cool parts about the coverage triangle as it sits and why it is solid strategy for stuff like this.

So the whole point of this tangent and going down this path is to try to give you some ideas as you're defining your goals and what you're trying to target for the year, some different ways and methodologies that you can do that. And one of them is by using something like this. I've talked about it a ton. I literally have an entire playlist built around the strategy itself. Go to for me, it is a old, well, not really that old, but it is a absolute go to strategy for me that I've run for some time. And I will very, very likely continue to keep running it because it benefits it just it benefits the overall portfolio in a really, really nice way. And it's easy to manage like pretty significantly easy to sweet. So let's talk a little bit more now about creating targets and goals for the year. So for the new trader, we already talked about what I would consider to be the initial target that makes the most sense.

So for the new trader, we already talked about what I would consider to be the initial target that makes the most sense. And that initial target is simply setting up a greater than zero return, right? That's the initial target for a brand new trader. Now the way that you achieve that is again, if you just focus on make more than zero dollars, who knows where you actually land? That's why I think for a small account, new account that's just starting greater than zero baseline. And then above that, I would pick something that you're comfortable with. It doesn't have to be much. You could pick 5 return, 2 return, like something like that. And the reason why I think that's a important component to it is because you're giving yourself a distinct target to shoot at. But again, you have to remember one of the issues with building your return profile is that a lot of people, they just inherently get way too aggressive. Meaning they want to have this really, really big return because that's what their mind wants to see at the end of the year. That's dangerous. That's really, really dangerous. And the reason why it's dangerous is because we start to, like I've literally have had people ask during some of my mentoring sessions, they'll say something like, do you think this return is possible?

    "text": "Yeah. And I think Tommy for something like that, that's like a really good, you know, beginners target. That's not something I think is suitable for a longer term or target, just because you obviously want to just like as a more seasoned trader, you will want to return more than that in case you need it. More or less, the broader return should be done in the context of either trying to drive top line returns or to reduce drawdowns, reduce portfolio volatility, something like that. Let me see. And it looks like. Tommy says I'm a beginner trader. Yeah, good. Yeah. Then I think that that makes a lot of sense. That's good. I dig that. Perfect. Shreys says Thor busy looking through book for 2024. Thor is, I think he has, yeah, he's not even in here anymore. Thor balanced. He was ready for, ready for his dinner. So before we wrap then let's do this. I want to work on the syllabus with you guys. And I would like to build it with you. Okay, cool. So I already had it started. Runtini says Eric, you should make some merch like flashcards. I don't know about no flashcards. If you want to make them for me, let me know. You can keep the money. Let's do here. This will be outlier options trading basics. This has to be an acronym outlier options trading bootcamp syllabus. And here's how I intend to break it down. Let's do.",

This has to be an acronym outlier options trading bootcamp syllabus. And here's how I intend to break it down. Let's do. I guess the first thing is how many episodes do we want to do? Because I think depending on that, it will change how many things go into this. So let's do a market recap. This would be things like exchanges, brokers, participants. Securities, that kind of stuff. Then we would do a derivatives recap. So this is options, futures, purpose, and traits. Then we would do options. We will do options, history. Then we would do elements or components, I should say. An option, settlement. We want to do Greeks, the Greeks, the utility. I think that's most of the recap stuff. Then we would move into intermediate. This will be things like, oh, hold on. This is crazy. So the exact thing that I thought was going to happen is what's happening. They're pointing the finger. These people are crazy. All right. We'll let them stew on that for a moment. Now, for the intermediate stuff, we'll take a look at the big four or no, the outlier strategy process, outlier trade process. We'll want to look at things like interaction between delta and gamma. We want to look at delta gamma theta theta. Then we will want,",

We'll look at technical analysis, fundamental analysis. We'll take a look at types of base strategies. This will be things like creating volatility, traction, et cetera. Then we'll take a look at the distance of start. Then we can build on this as we go. Because I'm going to have some quizzes for us along the way. Then the quizzes are going to help us dial in what stuff like out of this that we want to spend more time on. This will be what it starts to look like. We'll either start it next week or the week after, not fully determined just yet. So, that wraps me up. My dinner got here. So I'm going to go eat. If you guys need anything, let me know.
