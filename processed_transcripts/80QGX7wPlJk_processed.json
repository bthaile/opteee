    "text": "What's up, everyone? Welcome back to the Outlier podcast. I have saws and off ready to wrap up 2024 stellar year. Super fun time. How'd you fair out there? How did I fair? I think it was an average, you know, I'm a contrarian. So it's a little bit of a, you know, when you have a straight one, one dimensional, one directional market, sometimes that gets a little tough for me. I had probably only really one horrible trade all year and the rest I think was like a, you know, was a pretty average year for me. I did not knock the ball out of the park this year and I didn't get hurt either. It was just it was about an average year. I should have done better, but I was, I sold out some, passive longs a little too early. I guess. Yeah. And you actually preamble into the next question, two questions I had for you. Is I always think it's a weird question to ask, but I'm always curious to the response like of a trade that was memorable for a good reason and bad reason, not necessarily best trade worst trade, but memorable trades. And again, positive memory and then negative memory. What takes you to a dark place? It sounds like you had a bad trade. I'd love to hear about that one. Was it in video? Yeah. My worst trade of the year was in video. But it was in video",

My worst trade of the year was in video. But it was in video because I was, I got stupid. That's all. It wasn't in video because, you know, I am a person that completely accepts the fact that sometimes the stock wins. You know, I mean, I've had, I'm going to assume I've had hundreds of thousands, if not millions of losing trades in my career. You know, so, so I would think that I'm very comfortable, you know, not being right. I think that's, no, I can't be millions. So hundreds of thousands, let's say. And so I'm okay, you know, losing to a good competitor, you know, like a worthy opponent. But in the case of Nvidia, I got a little pig headed towards the end of that move and just did some stupid things. So yeah, that was my worst trade of the year, you know, walk, walk me through the stupid things size. And was it was it initial size or was it still it size? It was, it was, it was what I call angry size. Love that. That's good. A little bit of revenge trade. We all need that in our lives. Yeah. Yeah. It was a little bit.

Even though this is a democracy, it doesn't matter. Um, you know, it's kind of that, that's what it means. And what do you think of that in context again? It's like if we look within the energy sector, we know that there's a bunch of stuff in there that is doing well, but then there's also buckets that's that are doing poorly. And to me, that would indicate that it's starting to think about in forecast policy expectations. So if we think that we're going to drill more things that drill will probably be doing well. If we think that we're going to roll back green energy, green energy companies are probably not going to do as well. Do you think that's part of this or no? If it's, if it's part of a platform, I am, it doesn't bother me at all because that's already priced into the market. So if you're talking about, you know, a political party platform, then I'm fine with that because that's, that's what, you know, that's what people voted for. And, um, and that was known all long.

Let's think if there was anything else. I was on the right side of crude oil most this year in the equity marketplace. In the equity marketplace, I didn't have too many stumbles. I think my most challenging stocks in the equity world this year were Tesla and the second half. Tesla really since the election before that was fine. In video early on the year. And we might have got a little chopped up in some some weird earnings place over the course of the year. But for the most part, I think I traded the year pretty good.

Except the only difference on Fed numbers. I don't see a big volatility collapse on Fed numbers. So I don't like selling a lot of premium going to Fed numbers. The bond premium just doesn't seem to come in. Whereas if you're doing an earnings play, the earnings premium comes in dramatically. So it's not exactly the same thing. For whatever reason, the bond premium just doesn't come in. I always lay it out. So tomorrow, I will lay out bond premium prior to the number. But I just don't seem to get paid that much on it. It's like a struggle. Yeah, just have to do it because you got to do it. I get it. Yeah, it's interesting. I actually did a study looking back, especially this year.

Like what it's going to do tomorrow. Now specifically for earnings has your team tracked the variance risk premiums around earnings like back over a specific time frame. The question I want to ask is I'm wondering if you've seen a contraction in the amount of risk premium that you can get from selling premium through an earnings event as compared to five years ago or 10 years ago. There's it's a it's a it's a little bit of a loaded question because on if you ask me that question, if I had to generalize, I would say yes, markets are more efficient today than they were five years ago. So the pricing becomes more efficient because we're trading in tighter markets. So the answer is yeah, but earnings are no different than any other kind of binary event and they really depend on the levels of implied volatility. I find that earnings in markets like we're in right now are incredibly difficult when volatility is low and stock markets high, the implied earnings moves are too low for",

Maybe they felt that, you know, there there was a certain that it was susceptible to a little bit of short covering. I don't really know, but that move at that point, you know, like who's buying it up there? I have no clue. I want to be covering shorts. Yeah.

Right. So then for this kind of move, if it is shorts, how long do you think it hangs up at a place like that before that the short participation is essentially flat now and then it starts returning back to earth? It's hard to say. I mean, it was down like 12 bucks today. So started to come back a little bit to earth today. It depends. It's probably not like just because it rallied whatever 60 points, doesn't mean it's going to go back 30 or anything like that. Maybe it's going to go back, you know, 15, 25 points or something like that. And then maybe it's just that's good. You know, maybe that was the root. It's got to it's got to find its level of what it's, you know, what the new valuation is because it's clearly going to carry a new valuation. Right. And see what happens.

One of the things I use as an example of just government is the fact that daylight savings is still a thing.

It's incredible. And yet we still visible. So do you know why they do it? I was surprised. I thought it was something to do with agriculture and farming. That's what I've heard. Okay, great. But I'd love to know because I don't get it. It might have been originally, but that's not why they kept it. So the argument, the argument on the house floor was the reason to keep it is that they didn't want kids going to school, walking to school in the dark. For all the kids that walked to school.

So if there was somebody that was going to start trading in 2025 for their first year ever, what advice would you give them? Well, I mean, I would be excited for them because the one thing that you have to realize when you start because you're never going to pick the ideal time. It's like not possible. I mean, because I don't even know what the ideal time is. But what, the way I would approach somebody that's just starting out the way I would explain trading and finance them is that for the rest of your life, you're going to do this. Like, you're never going to stop. One, two, get bitten and you, and you start to understand market structure and, you know, markets and",

You obviously started when they were writing it on stone tablets. So the information was a little bit different. But for, for people today, they have AI, they have stuff, and it almost feels like they deal with information overload.

And for the trader that's starting then over their first year, what should they be focusing on? Like what are the things that you think matter most? Number of trades. I know that's going to sound like self-serving and weird, but that's not. The number of trades purely, this is, this is, this is a numbers game. And in order to get to a number that, that helps you understand something, you've got to just do it. You know, like, like, you, you're, you're not going to, there's nothing you can learn by just watching and not participating. And I think in the trading world, it's, it's, it may be more true than anywhere else. You have to participate. So that would be my. And how do they balance participation with probably small account size, limited number of trades that can go on at a given point in time? Yeah, that's exactly just small size, you know, it could be one or two or 10 shares to stock.",

Well, if you, I don't know, I think of it as if somebody started in 2020, anytime around there where a lot of people did, they actually got to see quite a lot in a short term timeframe because they got to see a pretty sharp contraction, the unbelievable reversal of like a three day bear market, which is like untold. But then they also got a bear market in 22, which is kind of cool. Market was a little bit of a bear market in 2022. I'm not sure the impact, but yeah, they did. You're right. I forgot about 2022. Yeah, they did. Yeah, because I actually, I was thinking about it. And again, like, I started in 07, but I've only seen three bear markets and two of them have been in the last four years. So I've been, I've been seeing the same pitch non-stop, same thing. Yes, been wild. Yeah. And that leads me to the last question. When the market eventually does roll over, always does with valuations where they are, where AVGO grows by 40. How do you think a potential unwind slash correction bear market might look? Nobody knows, but might look. This is the, this is the billion dollar question, you know.",

    "text": "last question. When the market eventually does roll over, always does with valuations where they are, where AVGO grows by 40. How do you think a potential unwind slash correction bear market might look? Nobody knows, but might look. This is the, this is the billion dollar question, you know. This is the billion dollar question. Let's make some money. Tom, let's get this right. I know. We can cash in. Yeah. I spent a lot of time thinking about this because on the one hand, you know, I don't want the markets to implode and crash and burn all that kind of stuff because, you know, everybody's inherently long. It's good for the world. You know, I'm a glass half full person. So I don't want that to happen. The other side to it is I've never felt stronger about the risks, like the pod odds risk in the market right now. Like what do I think that we could go higher? Sure. There's a chance we could go, I think maybe 6,300, let's just say we're 6,100 now, maybe 6,300. I don't, I don't see us going too much higher than that, but there's a chance. The flip side of this whole thing, I can see us going down to 5,100 almost overnight, which means I've got like four to one downside over upside. Easy. Maybe it's five to one. And I am a pure pod odds contrarian. So that's my biggest hurdle that I've got to overcome",

And I am a pure pod odds contrarian. So that's my biggest hurdle that I've got to overcome in my head here. I think there's 5 or 4 or 5 of risk for every 1 upside. And when I get my head in that space, it's very difficult to think objectively. So that's where I'm challenged with right now. So if that downside realizes what do you think it's a faster move or do you think it's something? Oh yeah, the downside moves are always faster. There's not even, there's so many red flags right now, which is like there's not even put skew anymore in the indexes. I mean the red flags are like, the skew is 170. There's no, that's the rating on outlaw. The market is so anticipating outlier risk that probably won't happen. But the skew numbers are off the charts. There is no put skew, which happens about 10 or 12 of the time, which is insane. And there's, and there is this unanimous bullishness among everybody. It's not, it's not, are we going higher? It's how high? And we might not. I don't know. I mean, the downside scares me. And I don't think any, the other problem is, I don't think anybody's short. Usually like I think shorts are there and",
