    "text": "Trading for income, it sounds so awesome. There's no customer, there's no manager, it's just you and the markets. The problem is most people apply an insane healthy dose of goldilocks analysis when they're doing this. If you're unfamiliar with what that is, check out a couple of my old videos I talk about it. In a nutshell, it's when we analyze things with rose-colored glasses, we're only focusing on the aspects that we like. The aspects like you don't have a customer, you don't have a boss. It's on your own time, you can do it from anywhere. There are absolute benefits. But there's a lot of drawbacks. You have to do a lot of things as a trader. You have to be risk manager, risk taker, researcher, you have to be everything, you have to be your own psychologist. You have to be insanely disciplined and you also have to be insanely not egotistical to be able to build yourself up. So it's incredible, but you have to do a lot of things and you have to analyze it objectively to see if it's for you. Being all our sailor.",
