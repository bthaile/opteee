We're going to talk about the market, the economy, all things stock market and as per usual, it feels like there's no shortage of things for us to dive into. So welcome back, David. Good to see you. Yeah, thanks are good to see you. It's an absolute pleasure. So first things first, what do you make of the market as it sits today? We are hovering near highs. We see slight divergences between some of the different indices, what not, anything catching your eye in particular? No, I think it's the, you know, we're in the meltup and somebody asked me today, you know, or is the election in a cause us not to have the meltup. I said we've been melting up, you know, it's, it's we're up, the SB is up 68 and the NASDAQ 84 I think to the highs from the October 22 lows. So, you know, that's a meltup in my book. We've been melting up. I think the next stage will be a what I call a parabolic final stage to this market. So I think we're coming to the end of a 42 year second of a bull market thing I've talked about with you many times. And of course, we're two weeks out from an election that in my opinion is probably the most important elections country's history. It's easy to overlook, you know, Civil",

And of course, we're two weeks out from an election that in my opinion is probably the most important elections country's history. It's easy to overlook, you know, Civil War, Lincoln and certainly George Washington, but I think at least in modern history, you know, the choices here are stark. We either go in a direction where we kind of begin to take back and get back to a capitalistic free market economy and back to, you know, solutions that are not all government solutions and get away from what I call the New World Agenda, New World Order Agenda of the left. Or we go in the direction of we could we could see the court packed and all of a sudden you don't have a constitution anymore because you've and you may not have two party elections anymore. So I think it's that stark that I know there are people that are, you know, selling their vote for Trump, a boy that alternative is basically we won't see America back to the way it ever was before. So I think we're two weeks out from that. People keep saying, well, does that mean the melt-ups gonna end here? And I said not necessarily. In fact, I don't think so. My conviction is still high that we're going to, I just raised my SP target 7500 from 7000.",

And it doesn't have to. If it rolls over, I mean, if it takes into the first quarter that's fine, but I think a parabolic means you can cover a lot of ground in a hurry and we'll see a rally like we've never seen. Don't know whether it'll be completed by the end of the year or not, but it's going to be, I think, a big rally. So that's kind of where I stand. Obviously, there are wild cards that can come in between what's going on in the Middle East. Certainly Ukraine, although there doesn't seem to be likely imminent thing there that's going to change. And what can happen between now and election time or even at the election. As I said today on Twitter, I think the things we have to worry most about is the left really has made it very clear that it's almost under no circumstance, do they want Trump to be present again. So that means they feel they are justified in doing almost anything to stop them. We've seen two",

And just department suit is to leave those those names in there. That tells you exactly what the left is trying to do.

I think that wall of worry is a source of fuel to keep this thing going. What can move it? Well, I'm seeing clearly the earnings are still in pretty good shape. The economies defied logic in terms of all the tightening that was done and yet it's still reasonably strong. You're probably still going to get a 3 GDP number. And the consumer seems to have enough left to keep going through the year. So I think at least for the next quarter, there's, you know, basically all systems go interest rates, although they are scaring people because they've backed up. My look at the charts and my look at the overall inflation picture and the economy, et cetera, I think we're bottoming in the bond market and topping in rates here. We had a backup from 360 back to, you know, almost 410, you know, 409. I think I think we're the next move. I think it's going to take interest rates down to three and a quarter, maybe 3 and ultimately, as I've said, before we get through the meltup, we could see 2.5 on the 10 year. So from, you know, from over 4 down to 2.5 is a hell of a move in rates. It",

And as I said, I continue to be, I know there is nerd about their tops of this, but I continue to believe inflation is in very good order right now, moving towards the Fed's target. And that's not going to change. And in fact, I think next year we're going to see deflation ultimately. So I'm not worried about this, you know, the Fed's, the Fed was wrong to go 50 base points and it's going to reignite inflation. I think that's that shows the nervousness that it's out there.",

Yeah, can you talk to me a little bit more about that specifically the Fed opening with the 50 bases point cut because I think that bounced around a lot for a while and that that I think is a little unnatural for them. Yeah, well, if you look, the Fed fund rate was close to five and a half, you know, five and three, it's five and a half. The, the long bond was down at four percent or below. And the 10 year was down at, you know, it's at three 60. So so when they looked at their policy, they said we're clearly too restrictive. You know, no matter what anybody thinks about the the strong jobs number or not, the policy was restrictive and the economy is not all that strong.

So so I don't I'm not in the camp that says, you know, laborers doing great shape or jobs picture and great shape. The Fed when they first started talking about a 50 base point cut, you know, a few weeks ago, you know, they were worried that the previous jobs number had been weak. And in fact, the Fed was getting criticized for not cutting in in August or July. So the 50, I don't think they were trying to make up for that, but I do think that really was driven. I had said this way, well before the meeting that I felt just based on I think Austin rules be probably the guy I list think of a handle on this, apparently, but he and he had made it very clear.

So I don't think the 50 was in any way a panic to a weak economy nor was it I think a mistake in terms of doing too much too soon. I think it was a step in the right direction to saying we got to get policy back in line with certainly what the market is telling us it should be and also with inflation as telling so it should be. I see one of the things that I've been trying to understand myself is when I'm looking at bond pricing, like even a month ago, it was showing a 29 probability of another 50 basis point cut. And that's essentially completely gone now. Now it's looking like a 88 probability of a 25 dips cut. The part that I'm trying to understand with that is that seems like a pretty erratic move, like 29 probability dumping to zero. Kind of like what are your thoughts on that kind of behavior in the pricing of the future cut coming up? What is it? Seven know. Yeah, you probably could tell me better than I can if you're in that trading",

Yeah, you probably could tell me better than I can if you're in that trading world. The erraticness is due to the behavior of the traders. I mean, they're moving that frankly, they don't have a clue. They're reacting to every data point. And so, I think I'm much more steady as she goes. Typical macro strategists looking at a bigger picture. And it's silly to me. You've heard me say in previous meetings. So it's been a while, I've been saying this. I think the feds behind the curve. They're not hurting anybody. They're shrinking the balance she's still. And rates are behind what the yield curve tells them they should be by quite a bit by over 100 basic points. So, you know, to me, I think you've got a lot of traders who have lots of opinions. I don't think they're necessarily being proven very oppression in their views. So they keep going back and forth based on, you know, emotions and based on data points or data releases, you know, and I think it's a silly, and it's always been there, but it may be more so lately.

Because that's what I've been kind of sensing from things is kind of, it feels like everybody's waiting for the shoot to drop and not really knowing if slash one that's going to happen. I mean, I probably underestimate how different my perspective can be because I'm a contrarian. So it's like the nervousness that causes most people to say there's something out there. It doesn't feel good. It's the same thing that causes me to have conviction and say as long as everybody's nervous, I'm fine. So I think part of it is just the natural contrarian at me. I don't get shook up by the street going completely in that direction. Yeah. So leading into the 7 November meeting, what's your general thought there?

Your perception if it is 25 versus 50 just for like a learning case study, how would you differentiate perceiving those two different outcomes if they do 25 or if they did 50? Like what would you take away from that? And you've heard this from me before. I think I really pay much more attention to the bond market than what the Fed does in any given meeting because the Fed follows the bond market. Not precisely and they're not, you know, sometimes they're going up the direction of the bond market. But I mean the general move in rates is first dictated by the bond market. And the Fed is kind of looking at backward looking debt and driven by they just tend to be later or slower. So I'm getting my lead, I'm taking my lead from the bond market. And as I said, I think you bottomed in the bond market, you know, whenever it was a few days ago. And then you kind of had a gap up one of those one or two of those days.

The Fed doesn't drive the bond market. The bond market drives the Fed or sort of drives the Fed.

The idea of dictated by the bond market versus predictive. Do you think the bond market actually dictates meaning forces the hand of the Fed? Or do you think that the bond market is really good at preempting what the Fed is most likely to do just from a causal relationship analysis? Yeah, because the bond market is not rates. There's a misnomer out there. Rates are not driven only by what the Fed's going to do up or down. You know, there's, there's the economy. There's inflation. There's, obviously, a job spicture that the Fed's looking at. But there's a lot of things out there's supply of bonds coming from the Treasury. You know, if we're just speaking of the Treasury market. So it's supply demand driven. It's data driven. But it's bigger picture driven.

It's the foreign currency on that rate that you and so all of a sudden it drove your cost of carry up so fast, you know, overnight, that and people were leveraged with that that people had no choice but to say, I got to look with it. You know, I can't carry this. So you had the whatever percentage of those that we're using, the yen for there and I'm borrowing in Japan, whatever percentage were in a very tight spot and very leveraged, that had to happen almost immediately. Then the balance of people who had more less leverage and had more ability to kind of work out of the situation, we're given plenty of time in the following weeks because the end the end backed off, you know, we've had the end back off for less basically two months. So, you know, those that had the luxury of time have been able to work out of the trades, you know, and so you had the immediate, you know, what you always do, the kind of the immediate margin call and then others who said, yeah, I don't want to be there long term but I don't have to",

So the odds are that the majority of that carriage rate has been reversed. Got it. Switching gears a little bit over to commodities. Crude oil had a pretty wild move relatively, not crazy, but it hit a low of 65 in September. And then it hit a high of what was the high here, 78, 48 on the 8th of October. Now it's been trailing down. Thoughts on the move there. Yeah, I mean, as you know, I've been the bear on the street for oil and you know, I'm still looking for 60 and I actually think there's a decent chance we see something in the 50s before the end of this year.

And that will be, I mean, I only know what the 30s, the, you know, the bottom, but somewhere down there. And then that will be lows in oil and coming out the other side of the bus when there's so much money printed to deal with the bus. You'll begin a long bull market in oil.

Why are they maintaining the current path that they are? Yeah, I mean, they can't keep cutting because they need revenue. They've cut a lot and they certainly don't want to increase at this point. So I think it's kind of, they'll do little cuts at the margin maybe or at least talk cuts, give some rhetoric and things like that. But basically, and this is a surprise, but we're producing a lot of oil in this country, in spite of it being in the Biden administration. Yes, Trump would be producing more, but we're producing quite a bit. The oil companies have really been doing a lot. Of course, China was down and wasn't demanding oil. I had a conversation this week or there was a stream of conversation on my feed about the EVs in China. I focused US so I don't pay much but I guess they've made huge inroads over there in terms of switching over to ED.

To my credit, I wasn't focused on China so much, but globally I said there's a lot more oil in the world versus supply and people are versus demand and people are giving accounts to. I think we are seeing that that's going to continue right into the global bust. Ultimately, we have excess supply over demand and that's not going to change in the next year. Got it.

The demand for energy is going to go through the roof and there's nothing not going to be able to produce enough wind power or solar power to offset the need for energy. So it goes right back to oil. And of course, oil takes many years to develop a new oil field. And we've spent all this time forcing our oil companies to do less drilling and less searching. And we're trying to move them away from it. You're going to have a goosing of demand in a very short five-year time span and not the ability to",

You're going to have a goosing of demand in a very short five-year time span and not the ability to produce supply to meet it and what gives it's price. So that's a long way of saying we're going to have other alternatives and nuclear is one of them. And the fortunate thing is the technology has progressed to the point where it'll be not the big 20-year projects, but rather the smaller nuclear plants that they've got the technology that I think the regulation is going to, particularly under Trump, is going to improve time wise so that you can actually put those things in on a timely basis. So there's no question we're going to see more nuke. What are your thoughts on gold? Gold's been hovering near highs essentially from the 26th of November, trended sideways for a little bit, dipped down into like the 26th, 27th handle and now it's hitting highs. Yeah, back, I guess it's probably several weeks now. I don't know whether it's a month, but certainly in the last months, so weeks. I raised my target on gold. I had a 3,000 target, what I call pre-bust target, meaning before next year's global bust and probably a first quarter, probably happened in the first quarter. I had a 3,000 target and when",

I had a 3,000 target and when gold was starting to push up against that, been kind of consolidating in the 24 or 500 area. Around there, I said, I'm raising my target, so my new target is 3,400. I think we could be there in the first quarter very much. I think that's likely. So I'm very bullish gold here. You'll have pullbacks along the way as with every market. So maybe it goes to 2,900 and pulls back 100 points or something, but I think we're on our way to 3,400. Then in the bust, as with most assets, it's going to go down. So you might go 3,400 back to the mid-20s, 25, 200, 200, 400. It might even go all the way back to 2,100 where it broke out from last year. That would be more than a 35 pullback I would. So 35 to 40 pullback. I think that's possible in the bust. But big run up here, correct. And then my target for end of this decade, early next is 20,000. So there's a lot of side gold still to come. And gotta talk about the catalyst there. It's having around 27, 12. So I assume it has everything to do",

Yeah, I've been pretty consistently saying for the last year or two that I felt the metals and the equity market would move up together. And people would take me to task on my bearer. So I'll call because they go, oil and gold always go up together. I go, no, they don't always go up together. And they're not going to go up together. They obviously haven't. So I think, yeah, I think their coincidental, I think you will see the equity market melt-up to 7,500. I think the SP and I think gold, you'll see, it's not a melt-up, it'll run to 3,400.

In the bus, in the guts of the bus, the dollar can rally back to 120. People are going to flee to safety around the world. The dollar will still get that flight safety trade. But for the next six to nine months, I see the dollar heading straight down. That's probably the biggest driver of gold is that weak dollar. And then lower interest rate certainly helps gold.

So there's more of a cyclical component to silver. But right now, I think there's plenty of demand for silver cyclically and silver has that other component, which is it is poor man's gold. So it's not it's not a pure monetary metal, but there are a lot of people that will run to silver when gold's getting a little bit expensive. And you know, you get more bang through, but it seems or you know, it's like it's like stocks, but see any able to buy more of it if you can buy the 30 something and you know, golds at 2700. So, so but the simplest way to put it in terms of as I see it anyway in terms of gold versus silver is that in gold markets, silver will help pace gold typically. So that that gold silver ratio, which was up around 90, you know, year go or whatever, should get down towards 40. If gold divided by silver gets down by gets down from 90 to 40 that",

So that that gold silver ratio, which was up around 90, you know, year go or whatever, should get down towards 40. If gold divided by silver gets down by gets down from 90 to 40 that tells you silver's way outpacing gold, right? So in a bull market, you want to be probably more heavily weighted silver. And then in the correction or when when we go through the pullbacks in these metals, particularly during the bus, if you can only either one, I'd probably own gold, you know. And then on the other side of the bus, they're both going to be sky rockets and you know, it's personal preference as to where you want to be there, but silver will probably help pace. Now, when we're thinking about this, the broader bust here though, do you like where do you think the the transfer or I'm maybe projecting here, maybe the reason, but do you think maybe it's the best way to phrase it? Do you think that there's a transfer of capital from equities into metals? And if so, where's that relationship? When does that start to happen in droves? Yeah, the biggest time in gold will silver probably hit much harder than gold in the bus. So gold, gold will outpace equities during the bus.

Obviously that's a much better place to be than equities if you had to be somewhere. Silver on the other hand, if it goes 75, it could easily come back to 30 or maybe even back into the low to mid 20s because it is so cyclical. And if we go through a you know, worse economy, worse financial situation we've had in POS World War II era, you're going to see big hits to things like silver. So silver is not something that's going to protect you on the downside in a in a bus. The bigger story, which is I think what you're really wanting to know is the post bus era when you know when we're coming out of that bottom and the feds printed so much money, it is going to be a cycle where commodities with commodities of all kinds will far outpace the equity markets. And it'll be a high inflation environment ultimately it'll start out slow but but in the decade we could see 25 inflation.

But during that commodity cycle, you know you can have as I say if the market drops if stock market drops 80. So let's say I used to it was easier math when the SME might target with 7,000 and I'd say you can go down 80 it's 1,400 but from 500 let's say it's 1,500 what it is. You can you can triple that number and be a 4,500 or 5,000 and still be way short of that 7,500 cycle peak this year. And obviously my numbers are just my guesses but so you can have a cyclical bull market that will never come close to the peaks of this cycle. On the other hand gold and silver and copper and oil and ag commodities are going to see highs many fold beyond anything they've ever seen before because it's going to be driven by all that money it's going to be an inflation cycle and so natural gas natural gas might get down to a dollar in the bust.

So so if you have interest rates doing that that's a huge headwind for the stock market because P multiples are the inverse of rates you know they move inversely to interest rates. So that's really what drilled the last 40 years as we had interest rates go from high double digit nearly 80s down to you know almost you know below 1 percent in 2020. So you had P multiples go from single digits to 25 or 30 and that's you know we're going to have the reverse of that post bust because it's going to be a huge inflation cycle. A curiosity I have with respect to the bust is normally when we see markets go through these larger corrections even to bear markets extended bear markets normally there are still elements of strength either in markets commodities somewhere do you see anything showing strength at all during the bust or is this literally everything is coming down together just in different degrees.
