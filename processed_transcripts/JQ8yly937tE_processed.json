Welcome back to another top the outlier podcast and today I have my favorite green chicken here with us our friends from Duneberg first off welcome and thank you so much for joining us. Eric great to be here and looking forward to a fantastic discussion. Yeah well so we got to start with the chicken in the room which is what's the genesis of the chicken? Yeah sure the green chicken is the well first of all I'm the head writer of a small team that publishes the Duneberg sub stack we launched it two years ago coming up here on May 3rd our two year anniversary. And we built this brand you know from scratch we have no social media presence whatsoever we were again this ultimate of consultants from the commodity sector focus on energy finance private equity venture capital crypto. And we decided to get into the content creation business after having consulted in the space for about 18 months and you know when you start from nothing you have to create something and and you know we many of the bigger content creators the brand is the face is the person and that that was not something we could do. And we had no pre existing social media to build from and so we decided you know the old adage of marketing as you can't be remembered if you don't stand out. And when we had our sort of initial",

Anish in the market for a bit more sophisticated doom better written a little better edited a little better research show our homework and we love our Bloomberg terminal and so as we were just sort of brainstorming doomberg sort of just came out of it and then. The concept of chicken little getting a terminal and scrolling through the blueberg machine looking for headlines to be afraid of was one of the sort of. Rifts that we did as a team and we found this cheap clip art anybody can find it the green chicken with the stun dies well it's just a chicken with the stun dies and the clip art that we we purchased and then we colorized it with you know some of the colors from the Bloomberg keyboard and stuff just to just to be fun and.

Yeah we had a spoke consulting firm where we came to see sweet executives and family offices and our our sweet spot was a family office in the commodity space that was sort of running a business. We needed to get unstuck and then we'd bring us in and we would sort of think laterally and leverage our multiple decades of experience in the commodity sector as executives to. Unstick you know certain businesses on a locked value and make money and we had developed a very good book of business and then covert hit and we lost 85 of it in the span of six weeks and like every small business owner you know you have a we call it a high pucker factor moment like what are we going to do do we go back to get a job do we.

And obsessed over delighting them as a small business owner. It's pretty hard to fail. Actually just really important wisdom I think even for me is like a new content creator right like I'm new to all of this I started a little bit before you guys did right during COVID. But I did not start in the content creation business I was just trying to like share information with like my veteran friends and I was repeating myself a lot so I made some videos you know so that they could watch and then we could talk.

So in the subset of economics our niche is what we know which is commodities energy and related and of course we also have pretty strong finance background on our team with you know private equity and venture capital and combination of those things which is what we were doing in our consulting business which is sort of helping unlock value through private investments or advising C. Exactly. It's like hey here's the technical assessment of this opportunity here's the financial assessment and here's why you shouldn't do it. Because it's likely to burn your money or here's why you should do it you know. And so that it's really fun to sort of. So you sort of specialized into stealing complexity so like I remember a client hired us because they had a really tough environmental problem that the internal team really kind of got stuck on it.

Different angle that was super fun we've taken all the fun parts of that job connecting dots. Pat and recognition explaining scientific concepts to finance professionals in a language they can understand all of those things are sort of wrapped into the Dumburg brand.

Right at it and publish and promote and defend 187 pieces you learn a ton along the way as well so just think of the institutional knowledge that we have built up inside of our very small firm. If we ever wanted to restart our consulting business man how powerful would we be given all the things we've written research and published and defended and. So one of the things we do after every piece is we would go thoroughly through all the comments which are close to just paid subscribers but they're having to defend it or learn something new or have you thought about this angle like it's all part of that continuous improvement learning journey so that's really to answer your question. The thing that excites me the most is that there's just an unlimited world of learning potential for us to dive into.

I love that and I think at least from like a retail trader perspective a lot of my audience really enjoys trading for very similar reasons because you get to learn about the world from the lens of finance which I always kind of find refreshing because you lose a lot of the the partisan stuff in some instances and it's more about dollars and cents. And for a lot of people that's like an easier way to consume the world but when you look at kind of the state of the economy right now what are some of the and I want to get into commodities and energy but kind of zooming out one level first to start when you look at the state of like the US economy first right now what are some of like the primary themes that you're keying into.

If you're thinking about the perspective of a retail trader what are some of the key pattern pieces that you think they should start paying attention to in general if they're not already. Yeah tough question because retail trading is hard hard to make hard to beat the market as a retail trader as you know and and so our advice of retail traders is don't trade until you like paper trade it for a long time and really understood what makes work but even then you know there's something visibly different emotionally about having your money on the line.

Or you could see that there's bullish indicators because you know one of their competitors went offline and they're running at full capacity and they have pricing power and the market hasn't yet realized that you know if you get a fundamental edge and then use some technicals to support your entry and exits that's sort of the classic way to do it.

You have your rules and the greatest indicator of success or a trader is the discipline with which they follow their rules. It's not even actually what the rules say because the reason why traders lose is because of emotion.

Like until you're a really good card counter at the black check table, you shouldn't be betting large.

We have to get that out of the way. Oh, I do. My favorite deadlift is the hex bar. Oh, interesting. So like from, from, from, from or on the legs, yeah, in the back. So I love the hex bar. Yeah, that's right. And my peak, I, at my peak, I did lift it. I'm going to have times my body weight. Good. Yeah, that's really good. Yeah, I think, I digress. No, I, I, I, welcome it openly because I actually, I am a, I'm a huge proponent of fitness in general, not just like physical, but mental fitness. And this is probably one of my most gifted books, becoming a supple leopard. I give probably 30 to 50 copies of that out of year. And it's because it's like I genuinely think it's transformative.

Options as a strategic investment, because I have a good feel for numbers and love trading options, even though, you know, I have a good friend, Tony Greer, who runs TG macro.

The more I listen to you talk, the more I find a lot of just general common themes from the concepts of stoicism that you mentioned up front, definitely notice that littered throughout. You talked about taking a big problem and chunking it into small problems. We do that in the Marine Corps literally all of the time. We have the saying, how do you eat an elephant one by that at a time?

Like I'm a firm believer that if you have a reasonable goal and you break it down to a thousand pieces of the elephant and you could isolate all the other variables except your effort, then there's no excuse but your own inability to work hard enough to get there. And many people actually, not to get too philosophical, but this is a great conversation and we're going down various rabbit holes here. Most people don't wanna actually do their very best at anything because if they do their very best and they don't succeed, then they will have nothing other than themselves to blame for their failure.

And so when I was in the sort of corporate world and when we were looking to hire, we had a very strong philosophy, winners win. So let's look for signs of winning on the resume. Not signs of pedigree, although there is an aspect of pedigree that matters, but signs of winning. And the number one sign of winning is what I would call that curve. What did you do with the opportunities and when they were given to you at various stages of your career, right? I don't care where you started. What did you do where you started?

And very few people have that. Far more people have the desire to find an excuse than they have the willingness to lay it all out there. Like if you're not, if you do your best, you will define what your best is not, and you best be prepared for understanding. Like, let's say I studied my ass off for a math test when I was in school. And the kid next to me beat me by 3 percentage points. Two things happened. I found out that that kid is better than me at math, which is irrelevant. I did my very best on this math test and set myself up personally for the absolute maximum success in life. So our belief is absolute measurements are the one that matter, not relative ones. So my personal deadlift record, Pales in comparison to yours. I could tell just by looking at you, compared to looking at me. But for me, that was the very best I could do. And I did it.

Like they're obviously very well written pieces and just about everything in there has a reason for being in there in terms of telling a full story. When you, oh, sorry, go ahead. No, bad, got it. Finish your presentation. I was gonna ask when you're writing about current day events like we're seeing day over day. A lot of these things have immense complexity. How do you strike a balance between writing a piece that is descriptive enough and has enough supporting information to give a good solid understanding? But you don't go so far that you're explaining every single thing you mentioned so that it becomes an unreadable piece. How do you find that balance? Yeah. So a great question back to our brand ambition. And this is really important. So there's sort of two factors. Our brand ambition and the fact that we have a person who is the editor that is a complete and separate and distinct role from the writer and editing is not proofreading, editing is editing.

And so if we can write it away that our editor gets it, then our ideal client probably gets it. But back to the brand. Our brand ambition and our brand is nothing more than the gut feeling you induce in your ideal clients when they interact with your product. We created Dumburg with the following brand ambition. When our email shows up in Eric's inbox, the gut feeling we induce in Eric is, ooh, I get to read that. Not, I have to read that, I should read that or that might be interesting, but I'll get to it, I'll print it out and then I'll never read it. And it goes in the garbage at the end of the week when I claim I'd ask. I get to read that. So how do we do that? We broke that down into three brand ambitions and the third of them hits to your question. The first is we shall be provocative without being polarizing. Nobody wants milk toast, but nobody wants, well, we didn't want to be just an outrage engagement machine. Okay. Two, we shall be funny without being silly. Our pieces",

This needs to be pulled out a little more because you're assuming too much in the reader. And we desperately try to strike that exact balance that you just described. Our ideal readers are financially sophisticated, highly educated, financial professionals that have succeeded in life that pride themselves on their ability to understand complexity.

And one of the most important things we did very early on in New York, around piece 20 or piece 30, is we decided that we would have a full day for editing before we publish a piece. So when we are going through our timeline for the week, right now, I have a mental target to get the next piece done by Wednesday for a Friday morning publication, which gives the editor a full day to rip apart.

So I actually really like that you guys think about it that way. Another thing I wanted to ask you is there's two big things that we're seeing a lot of conversation around right now. There's kind of the US dollar potentially falling from grace as the global reserve currency, lots and news about that. And then also kind of these new conversations with OPEC Plus oil production. I'm out of those two stories, what is like, what's the bigger story in your view? Yeah, I think the de-dollarization risk is vastly exaggerated. I do think there's a possibility of partitioning the globe into regions where the dollar still dominates and where alternative currencies begin to get more market share in certain regions. And for the average listener that partitioning is gonna be irrelevant to you because you live in the dollar world and our investment philosophies, we earn and fiat, we save in real assets and we invest privately.

We operate within the construct of the law and we have families and reputations and good livelihoods that we'd like to protect and we're not going to make a debt stand on the altar of gold. No asset is worth that for us. And so for the vast majority of your listeners, the de-dollarization stuff is interesting. We're watching it. Far more relevant is OPEC Plus and their market share in the oil sector and their ability to affect prices, which is the subject of the peace this morning and how China is sort of taking the place of the United States to the Middle East.

The era of 100 oil regardless of the economic recession slash expansion macro analysis that you might want where the floor price of oil might be 100. That's far more relevant to the average listener this podcast than the de-dollarization phenomenon. And we could be wrong. There's no question that the US dollar is still very dominant. It's going to take a lot more than what we're seeing in the news flow now with the dollar to be meaningfully dethroned from its position, especially if your benchmark is an average US citizen listening to this podcast who only has ever operated in US dollars. This is to me OPEC plus potential control over the energy markets is far more impactful in the short to mean even term than the de-dollarization from our mind.

I don't know if you guys go that far into that side of things it sounds like you might at least touch it but I'm curious your thoughts on that. Yeah, I'd recommend this. There's the viewers by a book called Confessions of an Economic Hitman and I'll pull up the book and get the author's name who escapes me right now while I'm talking to you. The playbook that China is running right now is essentially the same playbook that the US ran in the close world or two era.

And this is what John Perkins would say is sort of being an Economic Hitman. And of course, there's a price to be paid for doing that which usually involves you know, subordinating your economic policy and foreign policy to the whims of the Chinese in this case. But look, they're being very fruit about it. They're being very strategic about it. One of the big challenges that I see in the Western discourse is a constant underestimation of the enemy, so to speak, right?

It's probably going to back by our honest. Here's a way to actually hurt the revenue of Putin, which is to not focus on choking up their supply but to swamp him with supply, which is how you drive down price in a commodity market and thus kill profits. And yet, by sanctioning his supply, we drove the economic cost of oil and gas to nosebleed heights. And there was no amount of supply we could choke up that couldn't be made up on price. And this was all very clear. We wrote it and we got crushed like everyone, oh, you're basically we've got accused of being unpatriotic. What a fact.

And look at, I managed global teams of technologists around the world, I lectured at Chinese and Indian universities. I know the state of Chinese and Indian technology sector, especially in the oil and gas space, which is critically important to them. And the combination of Russia, China and India is going to be more than capable of offsetting the quote unquote Western technology and all of the arrogance that that phrase has embedded in it. And people were saying at the onset of the sanctions that this was going to cripple oil and gas production. And it would go to zero and this would bankrupt Putin. And all of that was utter nonsense. And pointing that out was basically called, you know, unpatriotic, when in reality I would call it realistic. Don't underestimate the enemy, overestimate the enemy and be happy when you have done so.

The, I'm actually really fascinated that you guys had like blowback like that from that kind of piece.

And sometimes I feel like that escapes the near term focus, at least the perceived near term focus that I have of the US. I question sometimes the way that we do things, but to your point, it's not because I don't love the US and it's not because I don't love my country. Obviously it's the inverse, it's because I'm concerned. Yeah, so I would say that your strength is your weakness. And so the Chinese ability to think long term flows in part from the fact that they run a very disciplined and violent dictatorship. And so they can think in 10 or 20 or 30 years because they don't have to face the populace. And that has its strengths, you they can think long term. And it has its weaknesses, which means their internal economy has far less dynamic elements to it in the way that the US economy does and more capitalistic economies do. And our strength being a relatively dynamic capital market system is also our weakness because our political leaders are forced to be held",

And our strength being a relatively dynamic capital market system is also our weakness because our political leaders are forced to be held to shorter and shorter short term measures. And so it's not a, this is not a, an attribute that is derived to sort of race or to, to being Chinese or being American. I think this is a consequence of the political and economic systems that these two countries have separately through their own unique history have arrived at. And so the American system and the Chinese systems should be compared, not the sort of Chinese people and the American people because we're all products of the system that we are born and raised in, of course.

The, yeah, I find not just the economic wisdom and just the market wisdom that you have in the wealth of experience, but just the way that you think about the world to me is fascinating and it's really fun to explore.

I definitely would love to have you back on, but before we sign off here, how can people get a hold of you? Yeah, so before doing that, I would say the best way for us to spend another hours to come back in a month or two months or three months and do it again. So, happy to do it. I enjoy the conversation as well. So, let's, let's go ahead and put it on the schedule to do it again. And the way people can find us is, look to work of my life is at dumber.substack.com.
