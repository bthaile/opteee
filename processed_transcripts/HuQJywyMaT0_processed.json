So it's worth spending a few minutes understanding what happened today and what that means for us going forward. So what happened today is we all probably have heard at this point, the Fed has selected to decrease rates by 50 basis point. Now for those that don't know, it's kind of a mixed view in my opinion. And the reason why I say it's a mixed view is because of a few things. It primarily comes down to how calculated of a path the Fed has taken so far with respect to rates. And then this near term acceleration is slightly interesting to me. So when I take a look at some of the primary inflation driven metrics, right? So we can see what they're expecting core PCE to be and what it was that they're clearly showing that they think inflation is under control that unemployment is strong, that the economy overall is strong. And I can see that perspective. But I think the relatively last minute pivot to a 50 BIPS cut versus 25 is actually quite telling because everything that we've done so far has been like very slow, very controlled, very, it seems like very considerate. And if there was going to be a 50 basis point cut in this cycle and it was projected like",

And if there was going to be a 50 basis point cut in this cycle and it was projected like that for a month, well, I would feel a little bit differently, but I don't because if we take a look at the Fed watch tool before it's most recent update, there's kind of an important change that happened here. And it's leading up until the last week, the probability of a 25 basis point cut was the overwhelming majority. And it kind of cut down, cut down, cut down until about a week ago. And then it finally inverted. We're now a 50 basis point cut was seen as more probable. The fact that that took place over the course of about a week is actually quite telling to me. It leads me to believe that based on the economic data that continued to flow in that the market started showing some level of concern. And that starts begging the question with respect to inflation. And whether or not it is fully tamped down. And even if it is, it begs the second question of what's the probability now of a recession. And we can't overlook that. So right now, I feel like in the near term, the market is going through this bit of a cycle of euphoria.",

So we'll do like a one day, five minute chart. And let's see what it did today. You can see, I'll do it just for standard market hours. So 0 630. And you can see when the cut was originally announced, it flew up. It literally went from 22 19 and a half as a low on the day to 22 87.4. I actually traded this pretty leveraged with futures because I expected this move to a degree. I didn't know the magnitude or how long it would last. But I expected a sympathetic move. What I did not expect is this subsequent return. I was running stops. And I actually exited a little bit premature in some instances because I started scaling out at about like the to the 22 75 handle area. So I missed a few points to the upside. But here's the main problem I see. This is euphoria that then got really trounced down to almost pre cut levels. That's very interesting to me that the market went through that cycle.

And I think we can see that being priced in. But I think the market is also now trying to understand what does this mean with respect to path forward and recession prospects, which then influences the way that we set up our portfolios. If we take a look at this from Y charts, we can see that the probability of recession be by August 2025. It's like 62. Then if we take a look at this latest by JP Morgan, this is from 15 August. I'm actually very interested to see if they update this and what this will look like because they're one of the few institutions that actually called the 50 Bips cut versus 25. And we can see as of again, about a month ago, this is showing the probability of a recession by the end of 2025 at about 45, which again is not insignificant. So I think the problem that we have right now is that this probability of a soft landing is not tiny. It's there. But it's also not quite as strong. I think as some",

It's there. But it's also not quite as strong. I think as some people might think it is. And then we can see what the probability is again, a recession by these different timeframes because we can typically see from rate cut campaigns. I'm doing actually a pretty big study right now to see based on prior rate cut campaigns, what that meant for the stock market specifically over set durations after we start the rate cut campaign. The problem is that we've never had the same scenario that we just went through. Where essentially we had rates at 0. Like that's there's not a good comparable period for me to actually compare apples to apples or at least even close to what we are going through now. Sorry, to what we've gone through over the last 100 years. So it's a little bit of a guessing game here. Now, when I'm looking at how to trade this, I'm playing the near term moves and I'm playing them very, very carefully. What that means is running stops.
