I don't know why it dropped, but I got a thing from Discord. Okay, cool. Thanks, guys. So the 23rd, pretty quiet, jobless claims. 24th will be the bigger one, specifically with PMI and then also the consumer sentiment. I am excited to see that and super quiet week from event perspective. Now we do have earnings underway right now and earnings look to be pretty well priced. I'm watching the futures and my mind is getting blown. Let me pull you guys over here because this is now up. This is crazy. So to see this level of movement in futures right now, I think this is a big case of the market really doesn't have a firm handle on what we're pricing things out right now. And I find that interesting because what's happening right now is, and this is this is why I watch futures open in the evenings, it's not highly informative of what it looks like the next day unless there are more extreme moves. But for people like me, it's one of the easiest ways to put on a cheap hedge if something looks like it's going really, really poorly. And the broader portfolio might take a whack across the face on the next open. You",

And the broader portfolio might take a whack across the face on the next open. You literally can use futures the night before to put on a, you know, posing position a hedge just to make sure that you don't get blown up. It's not something I use too frequently because as you all know, my relationship with hedging is very, very different than what a lot of retail traders tell a lot of retail traders try to talk about it from the perspective of I just don't like taking risk. So I'm going to put on a hedge, so I don't have to experience risk, which is literally a disease. The reason why I say it's a disease is because you get comfortable with that. And then you get uncomfortable with taking risk. And if you get uncomfortable taking risk, this is a really difficult business to be in. You have to accept the risk. You have to control unnecessary risk. And you have to have a overall comfortable relationship with risk, not extreme, but also not overly risk averse. And as a trader, you are literally in the business of taking risk. So yeah, that's mostly what it's looking like from economics perspective. Let's take a quick look at this. So this is the",

This is the last sentiment reading, just 73.2. It's been on the climb. It contracted a little bit here. So I think this next one won't be this was the pre-limb. I don't think this will be a huge deal provided that there's not a massive contraction. But I think a lot of this will already be priced in provided that it lands pretty close to where it's been. And then let's take a look at the composite PMI. Yeah, so composite PMI expanding quite a lot. It hit, it's low in April of 24. Let's get this on the three year. Yeah, so it's just been like a slow nonlinear recovery for PMI. The key takeaways from the economic overview is quiet economic release so far as I can see for this week. It doesn't look like there's a ton of data that's coming out that's likely to move the markets. Some smaller things here and there. I think the dominant market force right now is going to be Trump and what kind of shit he says. Everybody is waiting to understand what the game plan is. He went through",

I think the dominant market force right now is going to be Trump and what kind of shit he says. Everybody is waiting to understand what the game plan is. He went through and he signed a bunch of executive orders earlier today, but those are all like the softball bullshit executive orders like confirming the fucking cabinet and shit like that. So we need to see what actually what actual policy implications. And another thing that you should be paying attention to is the conflict between Ukraine and Russia. The reason why you should pay attention to that one is because I'm just an interested in it. So selfishly, I think you should pay attention to it for non-trading reasons. It's just a fascinating geopolitical thing. But from a trading perspective, if Trump executes as he's been talking about, which is trying to find a resolution to this thing, the way that that resolution pans out is going to be really important. It's going to affect the market. It would not surprise me at all to see if Trump and Putin and Zelensky all get together and they watch frozen and they realize that maybe they don't want to keep doing this. The short-term market reaction to that is probably very bullish. So that's an example of a news-driven thing that depending on when the news comes out provides you an opportunity",

The reason why it provides you an opportunity to position is because if that news comes out during non-market hours, you can find some sort of long futures position. That's exactly what I will do. And I will trade the long futures position into the news the next day, which we'll probably have fairly strong follow-through. At least for a day would be my expectation if not a little bit longer. Now there's also going to be some implications of that in things like Nat gas price, especially if the resolution looks like Russian natural gas will then flow again unless somebody decides to blow up the Nord Stream pipeline again. Who knows? Might walk around and do Netflix and blow up Nord Stream pipeline. Who knows? But provided that this doesn't happen, the impact to things like Nat gas to wheat will also be observable in things that we can trade. So the defense sector will probably contract on that news directly. However, Trump is also talked a lot about defense.

Right now it's still a relief rally and it will maintain status as a relief rally until there's something new that happens, which simply hasn't happened yet in terms of price behavior and resumption of an uptrend. It's just not there yet. I would expect to see it, but I also have to say I'm genuinely kind of surprised that futures are rolling over quite as much as they are. And I'm also still shocked that the Russell is up a quarter point right now. The E-minis in NASDAQ are about flattening out, which also fucking weird. This is weird. Vix is down 1.4. That gas is down 3.8. That gas will probably continue to have a move here. Just weird. Let me go look at some of these. Fruit oil starting to roll over. Fuckin' A. In bonds. What the fuck is happening right now? 30 years are up. What do we have for the tenure? Up 0.33. 0.5. So the longer end of the curve, yeah, in near terms about flat. Weird. Really really weird. What else is going on? Cryptocurrency, out flat, comfortably hovering above 100,000. Think I'll look at commodities. Look at these. These are starting to run. Holy shit. Born hitting highs.

I would expect to see that going up right now. So we'll have to keep an eyeball on that. Let's get back though and take a look at the sectors. So Q's looks weaker than spy, which is interesting, very important. No. Now Pelosi just took a really big position in a bunch of different tech companies. I made a tweet about it or I made an X about it. Again, whatever the fuck I'm supposed to call it, but she is, you know, she don't miss much.

It's her husband still way more fun though to think of Nancy pulling up Robinhood and just fucking slinging, you know, 500,000 positions like it's nothing that it's just too funny to me to I won't deny myself that joy, even if it's not fully representative of reality. All right. Small caps, flats, vix, flat looks like down as what we're seeing right now, bonds are going to be up a little bits, Bitcoin surging a little bit, but then recovering back down. It looks like Bitcoin is now really starting to define its its level above 100,000. It's not fully there yet, but the moving averages are starting to catch up there. We're starting to see like more distinct positioning above that 100,000 handle, which the longer it stays up there, the more support it's going to build below it. Let's get over to materials. Still relief rally, Palm services, still declining channel energy, very, very clear recovery out of here. It's up to 93. It's approaching highs.

It's up to 93. It's approaching highs. My expectation is that it would continue on this trend, especially with Trump's policies favoring the dominant players in the energy sector. So if we grab the visualized tool here and we take a look at energy, you can see that oil, gas and consumable fuels is the vast majority of the sector. So with Trump's policies coming out, this sector is likely going to appreciate pretty handsomely. We've already started looking at where is the strength within the sector for bullish style place? Because to me, that's the angle that makes sense right now is to trade this to the upside with bullish drift. And the main reason for that is because from again, a pot odds perspective, it's just a better return on the risk. I already know I've seen a bunch of posts of, I don't want to call them fools. We got dropped again. I don't know why this keeps dropping. It keeps doing this. I might turn off OBS and restart it because it seems to be, it seems to be just randomly cutting out for some reason.

I don't think fading energy right now here makes sense. That's the circuitous summary of whatever long version of that was going on just because of technical difficulties. I think that it is very likely to see this approach near term highs, which still gives us about another three, four points to go. And it would not surprise me in the least to see this surpass those levels. The reason why I say that is because again, if we look at the movement in energy leading into the election, it really got buried towards the end of December. And if we get some context here, we can see that it's been in this pretty long term uptrend. And now energy has just gotten a very significant catalyst and that catalyst is Trump and his policies. The dominant portion of this is oil gas. So the game then becomes choose your fighter. What do you want to do for oil and gas? You can trade something like XLE, which is absolutely crushing it. Or you can get a little more specific",

You can trade something like XLE, which is absolutely crushing it. Or you can get a little more specific than that and look for things within that are even stronger. So let's take a look and see what this might look like. And we specifically want to start with energy and let's see what's been running over the last month. So we've already talked about these names. These are not new names. You know these names. And there's even some people that have trades on in these names based on the stuff that we've talked about, which again, I'm always fully against anybody placing a trade simply because I talk about something. But I absolutely do recommend using what we talk about to inform and give ideas so that you can make the best possible trades for what your portfolio needs. But you can see CTRA and EQT are still leading the pack on a four week timeframe ish. If you take a look on a slightly longer term timeframe six months out, you can see names like TRGP, TPL, KMI are leading these longer term timeframes. So what I like to do is if I'm trying to trade this broader theme, the biggest opportunity generally has already happened. So what I was doing was buying calls and stuff",

You can see exactly where the entry occurred. You can see where the stops are. We actually need a new stop up here. So what I'm doing is trading the leadership. And the way that I gain exposure to the leadership is through this is less of a breakout style play and more of a momentum and drift style play. So I highlight that because I use a breakout entry that's kind of soft. The reason why it's soft. There's Joe. I'll hit him up later. Let him know that we're on a stream. He did a couple podcasts a long time ago. I'm still trying to get him to come back on because for those that don't know Joe's my best friend on planet earth. I love just talking with him and bullshit. I think he's a little shy so I don't think he loves the idea of a podcast. But there's just a lot of really interesting conversations.

So that was essentially the catalyst for the entry is just trading the upward movement and then the expected the expected continuation from here. And it's a it's a low risk trade. That's the thing. We've talked about this a couple times now. And this has been just easy, easy trade for the year. And it wouldn't surprise me at all to see this continuing as a leader in this broader sector. So that's one of the areas that I see a lot of potential is within energy, depending on how the policy rolls out. Dan says if we drill baby drill, then wouldn't that bring the price of oil lower? Sure. Also oil typically goes lower on ever publicans and goes higher under Dems. Yeah, the it will bring the price of oil lower. That's correct. The price of oil going lower doesn't equate to less profitability for the companies. It just equates to higher supply. So their margins might look different, but that doesn't equate to oil companies not doing well. That's going to be based on overall production. Now the cool part about cheaper oil is that that essentially",

I actually just connected with Duneberg again today. And Duneberg is going to come back on in the beginning of a February. Sorry. I think I have them coming on February 6th if I'm not mistaken. So we'll be able to talk with Duneberg a little bit about this stuff and get their perspective because they really focus on energy. But David says unless Canada turns off its oil due to tariffs, I'm actually really curious how impactful that would be. Let's see if we can find out. So let's look at US oil imports and exports by country. Let's see if it's any. All right. So let's see. So in 23 US exported more crude oil and petroleum products than it imported. It's been a net exporter since 21. It's produced crude oil in the world where does US import petroleum from Canada is 52 Mexico 11 Saudi Arabia, five Iraq for Brazil, three. And then the remaining 25 comes from a mix of other countries. So absolutely Canada is a really big component. This is also interesting. This is also interesting. So",

The interesting thing about that, it's like you send it to me and I'll send it back. I mean, obviously it's joking, right? Because there's going to be different kinds of oil and different stages being sent around. But it's just kind of a funny thought. Let's see a couple of other sources. So this is just looking per day. This only goes back to 23. Okay. And then petroleum consumption. Let's see. Consumption is, it's actually kind of level. That's interesting. Net imports is down pretty big. Yeah. Because here's the other reality. If we go through with this path, David says you have refineries. We supply, get gas back. And the interesting element though is like the US sits on a massive oil supply. So let's take a look at global oil supply by country. And I want to look at crude oil. Thanks to the oil, Shale Boom, the US is now sitting on more oil reserves than Russia, which is estimated as having 256 billion barrels of untapped oil. The next after that is Saudi Arabia to 12.

And that starts to paint the broader macro picture in terms of how we position ourselves. Because there is a long time where the US was like really, really, really hinged on gaining access to oil from other sources. But the more that the US becomes self-sufficient in this way, which is what it's seeking to do, it starts to have a much stronger bargaining position. And this is likely to be one of the major friction points between the US and Canada with the terror of conversation that's coming up. I'm so curious how that will actually play out. My expectation for somebody like Trump for those that don't know, you've probably heard that he's a good negotiator. And you can see artifacts of his negotiation skills in the way that he talks.

So if for those that don't know, TikTok started off banned yesterday and then towards the middle slash towards the end of the middle of the day early afternoon, the ban was lifted. And so now it looks like Trump is talking about an extension on the law. Now the next piece of that is the final resolution. Got to be careful saying that I think is that the, yeah, I think that that's a bad one. I'm pretty sure. I think our boy Hitler used that one. Was that, is that what he called it? Is it the final? Or was it the ultimate? I forgot what he called it. Is it the final? Well, anyways, the final resolution that Trump arrives at with TikTok so far, Dylan says final solution. Ah, that's it.

Final solution, not resolution. So it looks like Trump is trying to set up joint ownership of TikTok between 50, 50 US government in China, which I actually think is kind of a good thing. If that, if that can be done, I actually think that would be a good thing because I also think that starts to strengthen the general relationship a little bit more. Oh, here we go. So Trump, I just got a thing from breaking news that says Trump released a executive order relating to gender, let's see. All right. So this says in a significant move towards reshaping federal policy on gender, Donald Trump is set to sign two executive orders on Monday to, to incoming White House officials. One of the orders will establish the recognition of only two immutable sexes, male and female, based on whether the individuals were born with eggs or sperm. This is, this change is pitched as a way to protect that. I don't want to get it all that stuff. So the second order will block requirements that government facilities and workplaces that transgender individuals be referred to using pronouns that align with their gender, citing violations of first amendments, freedom of speech, religion, that are interesting. The game continues. They got to open the door for the way. He's",

Well, not to, I'm not going to get the railed on that, but the fact I can't help but just find it comical that those are some of the initial issues. The other thing I thought was really interesting. If I'm not mistaken, I think Biden hardened, Fauci in a handful of people, essentially right at midnight last night. Let's see. In some of them, I didn't know who they were. So this is from, he went to clemency, Sunday to five people, most of whom were convicted of non-violent drug offenses and community dissentances of two individuals who he said have demonstrated remorse rehabilitation of redemption among those was Marcus Mosaic Garvey, who was granted clemency post-humanistly.

I don't think so, man. Look at that. That candle is really not good. All right. Now let's take a look at the rest of the sectors really fast. Financials look good. They had really, really good earnings, really good earnings. We'll take a quick peek at those. Utilities are looking good, not as good as energy. Healthcare. I mean, slowly trending up, but not too heavily. And then discretionary, still outperforming staples by literally just a massive landslide, not even close. So from a long delta perspective, you literally have your pick of the litter. You have a stain power in comm services. You have stain power in not back. You have near-term recovery and velocity in energy in financials. You still have stain power in discretionary. It looks like if we're looking for some short delta, as we can find a few things. Now the Russell is flipped. Oh no, it's not flipped. The SP is about to flip again, back positive. We'll see. And then real estate is still flat.

We'll go through a broader portfolio update and all that stuff on the pro stream tomorrow. So I'm not going to spend time going through too many of my positions right now. But I do think we need to add a little bit here, not a whole lot. But we definitely need to add a little bit here. So I am generally agnostic to longer short deltas, I think both are fine. Let's see what pops up here. I want to run two scans quickly. And then I'm going to get back to working on the homework that I started with earlier, which is that coverage strangle analysis. And then if there's any questions or anything that you guys want to take a look at now is a perfect time to start throwing those in. So let's take a look at this first. So this is looking at stuff that appears to be consolidating. This is often the idea to find setups free breakout. So before they break out, that's not it. No. Nope. Maybe. Nope. Nope.

So the thing with scanning for stuff is my underlying my underlying methodology is something you're all familiar with, but it's called looking for nose. And it's not looking for the thing at the end of your face. It's scanning through stuff and making sure that we're stacking strength. So even though some of these like this one, this doesn't look good. This is not a good entry for the specific kind of scan that I'm running right now, which is a consolidation pre breakout. And the reason is because the entire setup going into a breakout here is all fucked up. It's fucked up like a football bat. That being said, that doesn't mean that this to your point couldn't be seen as bearish play, right? Like if we think that this downside channel is going to continue and stuff like that, but I'm specifically going to look for things if I want to put on a bearish trade that look diseased that really are super are super bearish. And this is not super bearish on a six month timeframe. It's still upward sloping. It still has positive movement on a three month timeframe. So the game here when we're conducting technical analysis is to try and align what we're doing with the time frames that we're trying to do them in so that it makes sense. Even on a one month timeframe, it's still positive sloping. So when we look at all",

Even on a one month timeframe, it's still positive sloping. So when we look at all of those different things that doesn't mean that this one single opportunity couldn't be bullish or bearish. And single opportunity could work out just fine. But what ends up happening frequently with traders is we try so hard to make individual trades make sense or work according to our approach. And that comes at a significant cost. That cost is how we deploy something over the long run over a long term timeframe. So what that means is if we over time continue to take sub optimal setups for something like this, the performance is going to show that the performance won't look good. So yeah, that's the broader context behind as I'm going through these. There are very, very specific conditions that I'm looking for that look good or don't look good based on the specific setup that I'm trying to find. And if I don't see it there, then I don't really waste much time at all lingering on it and will quickly move on until something else, something else looks better.

Travel says can you can you sometimes say a few few a few things why note for our learning. Yeah, absolutely. So going back to this one, why this doesn't fit well with the broader breakout approach is that it's below a point of control has too much overhead resistance. It also has all this price action up over here that I don't want to see. I want to see prior to break out near term highs. So local highs over here as compared to over here. That's a primary reason why this one doesn't look good. Now let's run through a couple other of these really fast and see I want to look for things on a shorter term time frames like a month, two weeks. And see if we can find things that are showing some strength like this. This is a completely different example because this is already broken out once it looks like it's in the process of consolidating here. So this one gets added to a couple different alerts so that I can monitor its price performance and see if it takes another leg up and chooses to break out again. Or if it doesn't and if it doesn't that's okay. I don't really care. But I'm going to try to play along with it if it does. And let's see",

For a hard stop and then a break below here. This looks like it's down trending. So I don't love that. I would wait and see how it behaves in relation to this high. And let's take a look at our RC. This one's another strong breakout. What is this based on you can see we've already looked at this one before because we have alerts on it as is. But this alert is completely useless now though. We need an alert here. And then we need an alert here. And then a downside alert here. This looks good. So for something like this, I'll do like a quick model trade. And then I'm going to get back into my homework that I was doing before. I'm still going to stay on the stream so you guys can hang out if you want, but we're coming up on time here.

So you have to pay attention to how you're sizing your risk. And the idea is to try to catch them a little bit earlier in their stages. Now this one I remember distinctly popped up when I was getting ready to go traveling and stuff. So there was nothing that worked out for me in terms of a natural entrance. But that also worked out okay because I would have been entering somewhere in here. So it didn't really do anything in this whole phase. And it's not until it broke above here that it actually showed us anything above this 3640 handle. Now on earnings it had a good beat. So it came in at 0.48 against 0.31 expected. Having a strong catalyst is really, really important. And if we take a quick look at structuring something in here, we can see that it has big call skew about three to one calls to puts. And we can see that pretty significant number of them are in the 21 March expiration just by looking at the dots here. And then I can",

This will be sample. And RRC. And let's see. Yeah, IV is super low. So that's easy decision on the buy. And then 288. That's good. We do stop. I'm fine at stop sub 40. 3987. So we're run it for 39. 87. So then on a since this is a really, really high probability trade in terms of a loss. So what I do is I tend to size these a little bit smaller until we really start to get a stronger accommodating move. So on a hundred thousand dollar account that equals something like maybe 15. I'm sorry, half a percent or something like that. So a hundred thousand dollar account. We can risk something like this. So that's out at 489. I'd rather be skiing is the homey. Everybody give a shout out to I'd rather be skiing because he just hooked a bunch of people up with a. Outlier trading membership. Those are on the YouTube channel. It's just a really awesome way to help support the channel. I appreciate it very much. You guys get a little bit of a different swag in the chats. And it also funnels you guys up to the top during the chat so that I can see you better. So really, really appreciate that.",

Actually that I've been slowly trying to groom. I'm still working on my trying to maybe line up with my old video editor as well. Because I liked our style a lot. But yeah, thank you very much. It helps me hopefully make stuff that's better for you. So let's take a look at this trade. This would be. Getting stopped out at 3987. Would we want to sell any calls in here? Maybe. What's the scope of this move? 25. And then from the breakout itself. 12. And then from here. 21. And then from the breakout. 14. So what I look at is using these as models. So about a 25 move. And we're essentially near highs. So if we zoom this back in. And we surmise that we might get like a 25 move on 41. So what is that 10 points. 10 is 410 20 820. Yeah. So like 12. So that puts us. What is this? So let's take a look at our C. Yeah, I wouldn't have any problems on some calls in here. I would keep them further out. But the it's like",

I would keep them further out. But the it's like really a liquid. So I would have to see if the liquidity tightens up. If the liquidity doesn't tighten up then no way. But if it does tighten up, then sure, I don't see anything wrong with offering a little bit of premium in here. On the short side. The reason why I say that is because these surges that it has are a little more orderly than some of the other stuff, some of the other stuff that we've looked at will have just insane, insane surges that then crumble. So once they finally slow down and you don't want to get stuck trying to unwind short calls that are in the money that you've rolled while it's slowing down, that's bad because then it kind of puts you in a bad spot where you're giving up profits to try to get out of those short calls for a profit. So we don't want that. So this doesn't look to behave quite like that. I would look to sell those short calls a little further out of the money, probably like a 20 delta something like that.

    "text": "quite literally a dumb study. And for a quick update on where that sits right now, it's a series of managing in the money short puts. So you can see that there is a lot of puts that needed to be rolled in stuff. But again, I just applied a very, very basic approach here. And as the strategy sits right now, it is a realized profit of like 3,600 total PNL right now is 16221 in the negative. So total return on a vested capital is negative 10.1 whereas the market as it sits at the time of doing this based on entry time to current time. It would be a little bit less than that. So let's see what I need to update the price to whatever it is now. So 42360. So let's take a look at what it would be worth at 423.6. So right now, who is this? So right now, so right now, where we're at in the study based on entry at 47561 current spot at 423, it means that the trade itself would be down 10.9. If you just did a buy and hold version, an hour version is down just 3.34, which is about standard fair. That's what I would expect to see. This strategy, especially during down moves, I maintain a pretty distinct advantage over it. Now, I'm actually managing at this point the first version of in the money short call, we're at the 405, which is kind of",

Now, I'm actually managing at this point the first version of in the money short call, we're at the 405, which is kind of brutal because if I were actually managing this, I would have already rolled that short call, but I didn't do that. And again, because I'm just applying expiration style management where we go to expiration. This is much more similar to what I trade in things like my IRA account. Where I'm not managing it anywhere near is actively is what I'm doing in the primary trading account. So let's take a look. We have the 405s, we just closed them for 1851. So now we have to see where we can get 1851, which is here at the 409. So I don't have to add any size and I can actually get a pretty decent basis adjustment. These are going to be a 73 delta. The premium I'm going to take is 18.8. I'm going to keep it out of one lot. I'm not going to size it up yet, although I could if I were so inclined. And let's take this over into the closed calls. And now we fast forward time. So right now the position is sitting on 264 shares at 453 18. And we have one short put out at 412. We have one short",

What I'm doing is I'm implementing like I was telling you before a slightly new approach. And I'm using two different factors to determine the allocation utilization and scaling protocols. The first factor is distance three factors. Sorry, three factors. The first factor is distance off of highs. The second factor is every 5 down move. Third factor is VIX. And I'm using VIX to manage the overall scaling approach where during VIX, periods that exceed a certain level, I stop scaling in. And the point of that is to try to minimize how much I'm stepping in front of really big down moves. But the scaling in that I'm referring to there is by buying shares outright. The scaling in still will be accomplished via short puts. Lauren says same strategy, different approach. Yeah, that's that's kind of it.

How much I wanted to use upfront. And the way that I answer that question is I download data from bar chart, just stock level data. And I say, I want to know how in this case, SP 500 tends to move. So I'll download the data and then I'll run it through Python. And I want to ask myself some key questions. What I want to do is make sure that I'm using enough of the portfolio to make money. And the amount of money I need to make is more than buy and hold. Otherwise, I'm better off with buy and hold. So the first question is how much money should I be using upfront at the at the entrance of the strategy. Should it be 30 40 50 60 so on and so forth. The way that we answer that question is we say based on different initial entrances, all those different percentages that I just listed out.

That doesn't really help anything. I say completely random meaning it's not forecasting S and P 500 going up 500. What we're doing is we're using old data to then train a future simulation so that the future simulation will be absolutely novel. But it won't be crazy. It'll still be applicable. And then we run like 30,000 simulations, which is really fast. Based on that, I can figure out what is the optimal initial starting point. And then from there, I can take a closer look at what's the appropriate scaling protocols, how much money should go in at what points. And the way that I structure that is actually a bit of a mix. The reason I say it's a bit of a mix is because it's not based purely on what's fully optimal. It's based on what's robust, but what's also easy to replicate.

So it means that they're not fully optimized to get the best possible outcome. But it means that they're really replicable across all of those different tests series. So that I know that the rules that actually make sense is not just overfit to the data source. So we'll go over all of this stuff way more in detail during the Patreon stream tomorrow. Once I have this kind of finished and dialed in right now, I'm just going through the high level stuff. So given you guys the context of the study and then running through this is like an eyeball test. This doesn't, this isn't really for anything other than for me to see what the performance could look like based on the defined management protocols. See how it looks like on the chart see if I like it. See if there's things that I feel like I need to test differently and back on a stuff. So that is what we're doing right now.",

We are ready to, are we ready to fast forward? We got to go through the chart. So the other scaling rules that I tinker with is the relationship between stuff like 200 day m a's 50 day m a's the relationship between the m a's amongst one another stuff like that. And what I want again is not to find the the scaling tool that's quote unquote best in terms of what gives me the best possible results. But I want the best tool in terms of there's less variance across all the different studies, which tells me that it's much more robust. Alright, so let's go to 16 step. And I am just fast forwarding to the actual explorations. So now we are very clearly rolling back over. So let's see where we're at. This will help these in the money calls, but it will hurt literally everything. So let's see, we had the 409's we sold them for 1880. Let's see what they come in. Any.

So I never close them at like zero, like I don't take them in an expiration. The reason why I don't take them in an expiration is because I know I am going to sell the early. More on expiration day, meaning like I don't want to go through the weekend without the position on because then it doesn't right doesn't really help me. So we're at 383. That 383, SP 500 is down 19.47 from our entry. Our position in total is down 8.8. So it's absolutely crushing the SP 500 like handedly. So let's take a look at. The short calls are easy because those came down for a full profit. We got to take a look at the puts, which are going to be struggling, which are the 412's here. We're going to have to close those for 2887. So now we have to roll these again. I had just gotten into a clean set of puts, but that is now gone. So let's go to 21 oct. Lauren says it will hurt literally everything. Yep, that's right. 21 oct. 22. So stock is at 383. Expiration is 21 oct. 22 today's date is 16 sub 22. And strike price. Let's see. We can get the 412's. So we need to get at least 28 bucks. We can",

We can get the 412's. So we need to get at least 28 bucks. We can get that here at the 410's. And we don't have to add size. Now from my approach, this is not where I would add size anyways on these short puts. The reason why I wouldn't add size here is because from a technical perspective, it's below literally all of the moving averages. The moving averages are all essentially inverted at this point. And the price just fell out below this level. So it's not consolidating at all. So if I can get a decent role like I can right now without adding size, I'll take that because it's we don't know where the floor is. So that that's why. So point eight fourth. This is poking me. Feels like there's the end of a. Feels like the end of a tag. Having me. But I don't feel it on my thumb. Weird. Okay. So we have 84 delta. Premium is going to be 2839, which actually is no good. That won't do it. We need. 411. So we're going to get a one point price change. 25 delta. Premium is going to be 29.22. One lot. Lauren says tags are evil. I caught out all minutes at system. I do",

How does that make any sense whatsoever for a fucking dog toy? Okay. One other admin note is in this study. I am selling below my basis. I found certain deltas make the most sense based on where volatility is and stuff like that. So that is a slight difference than what you will see in other scenarios in this trade right here. The correct is. The 20 delta. But then I also keep the size smaller. So right now I have 264 shares. I'm only selling a one lot. So it's a way for me to take in something but not get myself in trouble. So now we go to 21 oct. And see where we're at. So now it's basing. So now we can see it hit a floor here. It's setting a lower a higher low. It's not yet challenged this local low here. So it would be a little early to scale in but I probably would do it. So let's see where we're at.

Lauren says sorry, no, but you haven't I also wonder yeah, okay. So yeah, in a broader context, normally when I'll say it'll be attached to some kind of delta's. So normally I'll say something like I need long delta's. I need short delta's. I need some type of specific delta's. And the context behind that is I am looking for a specific kind of beta weighted delta's for the portfolio. So long delta short delta's. And it's to smooth out what I'm holding. All right, so stock is now at 394. We're going to close these short calls for 11 cents. So we made 280 bucks on those. It's about a 0.7 return on invested capital. Our total close call PNL at this point is 36. Hyundai so pretty good. Close that off. And now our puts should be fine. We're at the 358. So those will be essentially down for a penny. So minus 0.01. And again stock is at 394. Okay. And then we'll run a quick update and run a comparison of where these are at. This over here. So now it's going to be 18.22. Expiration we need to look at.

Lauren, let me know if that answered your question is 16 Ds. You'll notice that I'm just defaulting to the nearest. Standard expiration. I'm actually not going out as far as I typically would. I would go out a little further than this. And we have pretty much a blank slate right now to work off of the current price again is 394. So by and hold perspective that position would be down 17.2. Our position is currently down 8.86. Total option PNL as it sits is 5,000. Total stock PNL right now is negative 15,000 625. And that's using again our total shares of 264 at a basis of 453. There's still zero change there and we'll look to to probably unwind some of those. Alright, so now let's get back in here 30 delta is 381. We're going to be at the 381.3 premium 5.29. We're going to keep this out of too lot because that's pretty lucrative. Short calls. We're still at 453. So we have to be much further out. We can use like these 413s. Break price 413 delta 0.21 premium 2.55. We'll do it one lot and let's get to expiration. So we're going to be able to get to the 1,500.

Sock is at 389.82. 389. So what's around the money? Let's manage this. So 389.82. The calls will come off for a penny. Call it 389. We made another 254, which is about 0.6 on the short calls. And the puts are going to come down. 381s. Oh, no, we're good. The puts will come down for 73 cents. And 389. So the stock while we were in it just went down like 1.3 not much. Okay. So now let's see where the position sits in total. We have 15 days. It's a day early just because it was being weird when I looked at it on the 16th. So stock at 384. No, I'm sorry, 389.

And so yeah, that's, I'll show you this form now because I think this is the cool part is with this strategy in executed in a completely dumb component. This strategy walks out down 9. So definitely a down year. But it's literally down half of what a buy and hold equivalent would have been down. So that's the neat part about something like this. You can see that the total stock requirement out of this. Has secured amounts 119. So right now it's essentially all of it. But we have another 40 that we can put out via short puts, which is exactly what we'll do. So I'll make a video summarizing all of this because I think it's a really important topic for everybody. But yeah, just wanted to show you working through some of it together. I'm going to get ready to go grab my dinner. If you need anything, hit me up in the discord for the pro members.
