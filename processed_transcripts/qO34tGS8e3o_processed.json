So let's, I don't know about this stuff about musk. Ah, I see. So this looks like it just happened a little while ago. Yeah, so this is essentially musk saying that he hopes the US and EU will have no tears. And so let's take a giant step back. What's happening right now is Trump is clearly using the tariffs as a way to start dialogue. And it's super important to understand this. Now the way that we arrived at these various relationships, and if you haven't read this, you should because this document is really interesting because a lot of what it talks about raises a lot of questions on how are we even calculating what the total tariffs are because it's not just the direct tariffs. It's also fiscal policy that gets involved in that which starts to get kind of weird. But but beyond that, it seems like the broader intent here is to use tariffs as a method to start gaining attention. And let me show you why I have a, oh yeah, I posted it on X. Oh no, in the discord these. Oops, open this one. Open this one. Open this one. So what I'm showing you is a stream of different different tariffs as they sit right now. And the",

It's really important to try and strip away your bias, your preference, the things that you want to see, the things that you would prefer to see. And we look at this in the context of what it is. And so far, Trump has done several things seemingly in an attempt to gain more traction quicker on different issues, different things that he's taken issue with in campaign done.

The reason why this matters is because there are people right now that are freaking out, crying, all sorts of things. And they're saying, well, tariffs are terrible, tariffs are bad. We shouldn't do tariffs. And again, I'm not weighing on that one way or the other. But the fact of the matter is in a lot of these other countries, there are tariffs. So whether they're good or bad, we like them or we don't, there are absolutely our instances where there are not only trade differentials that are massive, surplus and deficits, typically slightly disadvantages to the US. But there's also existing tariffs in these other places and duties, not straight tariffs. The reason why all of this matters is because I think it partially gives some insight as to why we would come out with a sludge hammer where everybody thought it was going to be a scalpel. I was duped too to be clear. The entire stock market was duped because the way that it was messaged coming into this was that it was going to be way more scalpel.

That matters. Now there's this side of the argument that is completely hinging on the trade agreements between countries. And that's more so how Trump looks at it. It's not so much as individual items. I noticed that he'll use different items for examples. But you could tell he's talking about it at the country level, whatever the trade disparity is there. Then there's the reshoring element of this, which is also a thing. And the reason why this is so important is because we have a couple of questions again as traders to ask ourselves now to figure out what we think may or may not happen because again, this is how we position ourselves. And I'll show you what I mean. If we have this issue, let's this issue here, we call it tariffs. The issue was split into two pieces. There's trade, which is our relationship with different countries. And then there's reshoring. These issues do not behave the same. Example, if one of our reshoring priorities is domestic chip production, if this is one of the key things that we're trying to accomplish, which has been said multiple times, well, what does that tell us?

This is absolutely a thing. But when we think about something like GDP, this isn't talked about enough, GDP, gross domestic production, gross domestic production, he, the D matters as I like to tell my wife. Okay, so the tariff revenue side of things in the beginning with all of these tariffs is going to be high at a high level, right? So if we have this level, this is zero tariffs, this is 100. This is the revenue generated. It's going to be build up. So the amount of revenue that we're going to get from tariffs will be higher in the beginning. And then a lot of people are saying, well, how does this make sense then? Because Trump is talking about all of this tariff revenue. But if the tariffs then get negotiated down, then what happens to that tariff revenue? This hope, this opens a really important point that hopefully you're following at this point.

But there's a compensatory element, which is the amount of revenue that's generated now from reshoring, which maybe it starts here, actually starts to increase. So you start making more money from this side of the equation. I am in no way suggesting it is as simple as this because it isn't. But at a high level, this is a big piece of what's going on here. And the reason why this matters so much to you is because the entire market right now is in a wildly dangerous place, a wildly dangerous place.

That's things like if other countries start increasing their tariffs and this turns into a tariff war, that's destructive. That's literally going to hurt literally everybody. And if you take a look, one of the interesting things I've found so far just kind of poking through this is if we hide this so you can see, you can see Israel, who funny enough is supposed to be one of our really big partners, but somehow there are tariffs there for whatever duration. But then all of a sudden, there's now movement. When did this happen on the 1st of April? Interesting. So this is obviously people looking to make a change. So this is Israel. Next, there's Argentina. Argentina is now in talks with, I don't know how you couldn't have a successful talk with sideburns like this, but they're having talks right now again to attempt to get rid of this tariff picture. This came out on the 1st of April. Next is Vietnam. Vietnam is trying to figure out how to decrease the tariff picture. What I'm trying to highlight is right now, whether you like it or not, doesn't matter. Again, try to look at it objectively because to be clear, there are plenty of instances right now where I don't like the way that we're treating some of our friends, like my opinion. I",

I wish that it was more collaborative, but what I wish doesn't matter, what matters is what is. So right now, as these tariffs are being launched, you can see that there are a lot of instances where there are countries saying, oh, shit, this is actually happening, need to do something about it. And this is why for a lot of people that were very, very curious what was going on in Nike is this. A lot of shoes are built in Vietnam. So countries, I'm sorry, for companies that do business in countries that are looking to reduce their tariffs and there is a probability that it might happen. The shares are appreciating pretty significantly. So this here is really interesting to see. And you can see that it's happening in a lot of different places. It's not just happening in primary trade partners or countries that were close with like Israel. It's starting to occur in other countries. So now we have a really, really delicate problem in front of us. How long do the tariffs stay in place at what rate? Because if the tariffs stay in place for a long time at this rate, when I",

Because if the tariffs stay in place for a long time at this rate, when I say a long time, I literally mean a couple months, there's going to be massive, massive damage done, massive damage done. But right now it's essentially trying to negotiate through strength. Again, whether you like it or not, just look at it objectively. That's what this is. The only reason why you slap on tariffs like this rather than trying to come to an agreement before you put the tariffs on. This is essentially showing the bite before the bark and then trying to have some sort of dialogue afterwards. We do not know if this will promulgate because again, this issue that I showed you earlier, I don't have a sense of this yet. I don't know. But this becomes if this is weighted by Trump 51 on the scale versus trade, that means that the negotiations and the discussions that you see around trade are not inherently going to move the needle if we're trying to use tariffs to drive reshoring. So at this point, from my lens as a trader, what I'm doing is paying hyper close attention. I've been listening to stuff all day today because I, this is the kind of thing that can move",

So that's effectively what I'm seeing right now with this whole tariff conversation. Dark Mark says any good listens. Yeah, give me one second. So the anything with Scott Besent has been good. I've listened to a few. He's been on a few things pretty recently. I think listening to Lutnik has been on Forbes. I try to avoid listening to the commentary on either CNN or Fox, just because it's like it's too polar. But as you all know, all of these new stations, every single one of them has a tilt of some sort. The only reason I'm mentioning that here is it is something you should be aware of as you're listening because it's going to change the kind of questions that are asked and then the answers that you get and then the narrative that you walk away from.

But then I will literally go back and listen to it on CNN, Fox, just other style interviews about this stuff because it's important to get some different ideas. Like for example, one of the one of the things that I did not know is that and this has not been covered on the right side of the equation is that there are some things from China that are essentially going to have over a 70 tariff, not the whole kit, not everything from China, but some things because there are some items that had a prior classification that now additive with all the rest of this stuff there's more. So that was an interesting thing that I didn't catch elsewhere. And from the other side of the equation, there are different elements that you can capture like some of these pieces of news, these conversations that are happening. I'm not seeing a lot of that from other places. I'm also not seeing a lot of the left side of the news so far talking about this relationship between revenue because we're essentially",

And this is effectively all bad, which again, there are absolutely as an argument there, but it's important to note that as this happened, there is there is no tariff on domestic production. He's made that clear. Even with automotive's, if a car has parts from other countries, but then is assembled in the US, there's no tariff on it. So like piecing together all of these little details takes a lot of time and effort because you have to go to all these different news sources because everybody's a fucking agenda and you can't just hear information. It's super annoying. I would love to just see a list of information, but alas, we do not have that. Anyways, this relationship super important to pay attention to. Okay, so before we pivot away from the whole whole tariff thing, the first thing is I want to see if what I just talked about connected, it doesn't make sense.

What I mean by this is as we get new news, new information, the pendulum swings one way, and then it swings back this other way. But maybe it stays within this general range to find here. Well, right now, what you see in Nike is this. The pendulum is now going way out here and way out here. And imagine this being the price of the stock.

They're not saying that they're in good conversation right now. They literally just said we are trying to reduce the tariffs. That's effectively what they said. And if you look at the movement in Nike, it's like, oh, yeah, we are back. We are back bit to him, baby. And you had better belief that if these conversations don't go well or if Trump decides at that point, now, you know, I understand, but I still want to reshore. Guess where Nike goes back this way. So this is one of the environments where typically when I'm trading this kind of this kind of stuff, it's like day trades. It's very short term durations. The overwhelming majority of what I do as a trader is much longer term, not much longer than a day, much longer. But typically like two to eight weeks, something like that. But right now with how wild everything is and how much this pendulum is swinging, everything is really shortened up a lot for me. So if you pay attention to those things, there can be really cool trade ideas, which is really",

So if you pay attention to those things, there can be really cool trade ideas, which is really easy to do. All right. There was a couple of things I saw pop in. Dark Jen says, but how long does it take for companies to reshore? How much reshore does a company have to do before they are exempt? How long is reshoreing take if it's going to take four years, wouldn't it? Where's the rest of your thing? Make more sense just to wait for the next administration. It's a great question. And that's actually something we talked about the past week is we don't know how different organizations and different companies are thinking about it yet. Because the reality is that's exactly correct. However, there's likely going to be different incentives for different places to reshore. There's a there's again, the ability to look at stuff objectively is super important. And let me ask you a question. When you think about COVID, what kind of what kind of thought do you have about COVID? Like do you think that it was a good thing? Do you think it was a bad thing? What's the general sentiment you have towards COVID? Because the vast majority of people will say COVID was bad. COVID sucked. A lot of",

There's still good stuff that came out of COVID. COVID was useful. One of the things COVID identified is that right now America is overly dependent on people that we don't necessarily have the best total relationship with some of which are our direct competitors. And if there is some sort of conflict escalation, having really important things like medicine, chips, technology, built, or largely built by these competitors is fucking dangerous. That's the reality. And that's something that we got too comfortable with with respect to just globalization and trying to become overly efficient because there's a relationship. There's a relationship between robustness again back to our teeter totter that's apparently not connected. There we go. I got like a little ball on there. So we have robustness efficient. When we talk about globalization, this is what we are focusing on efficiency. We're essentially saying Taiwan for an example, they've built the infrastructure. They have the expertise. They have the facilities. It is so much more efficient for Taiwan to build chips in Taiwan. But guess what? During COVID, what",

We noticed a egregious lack of robustness because so much stuff that we use now depends on chips and we couldn't get them. So from COVID, we learned that for something like chips, we need to sacrifice some of this efficiency in order to prioritize a little bit more robustness. Now, like most things, this is not binary. This does not mean that you can't be purely robust or you have to be purely robust or purely efficient. It's not that at all. But what it does mean is that there has to be some production changes in order to strike a balance here. So this is relative to chips. This will happen across the board. So going back to dark Jen's point is how long does it take? It depends entirely on the company. There are a lot of like think of auto manufacturing. Auto manufacturing, they literally need to come back in dust off a bunch of these plants, rehab them a bit and they can easily get back online. If we're talking about chips, where you have to build literally state-of-the-art facilities within sane tolerances in order to produce what you're supposed to produce, that's going",

If we're talking about chips, where you have to build literally state-of-the-art facilities within sane tolerances in order to produce what you're supposed to produce, that's going to take longer. But that's also why the incentive structure will probably be different for them. So that's it really is industry and company dependent. And it's a really important thing to pay attention to because again, going back to the trader's lens. You'll notice I do this all the time. When we're talking about broader concepts like this, my brain always goes back, where's the tradable part of this? Is there a tradable part of this? How can this inform trading? And there is an informative function here. Because what would you think about the probable performance of chip companies in the near term, even if they do agree to reshore? We already know it's going to take a long time for them to do it. So unless the incentives are maintained, which I imagine they would be, literally from a global security perspective, they're probably going to struggle. So you can come up with different ideas like this. Again, automotive manufacturers. Right now, you can start doing pairs trades and think about long, domestic producers, short, non-domestic producers. There's even non-domestic producers that are looking to build plants here or to begin manufacturing here, piggybacking off of existing",

There's even non-domestic producers that are looking to build plants here or to begin manufacturing here, piggybacking off of existing plants to avoid the tariffs. So all of that means it really takes taking the time to do a pretty thorough analysis of the exact industry you're looking at to see how long does it take and what is the existing incentive structure there and doesn't make sense for them to reshore. But I think for a lot of these places, there's actually probably going to be pretty steady pressure on reshoring. And the other thing is how much reshoring does a company have to do before they are exempt? It's really about domestic production. So like again, for automotive, for example, they can use parts from other countries. But if the car is put together and actually built and produced here, then that would be exempt. So it's also industry specific. Like most things, unfortunately, there's not a simple blanket answer for all of it. Bull says, anyone who know of a community working to track details like China, Band, Rare, Metals, Export to USA read on that, but want to dig in and confirm hard to know it's accurate.

Shut the fuck up media. It's kind of like shut the fuck up Fridays. But I mean, that would be so sick if there was just just straight information. Trump did blank. Leave everything else out. Pelosi did blank. Leave everything else out. Just say whatever it is because I mean, the sensational side piece will always be there. But again, anytime I see stuff like this, I don't blame the media. I really don't. I blame us. Us on the consumer side is exactly what causes all of this. If we as consumers stopped watching Fox, stopped watching CNN, guess what? They would have no views. They would have no ad revenue. They would have no business. They would fucking die. They would weather and die slow deaths. But no. Because apparently, especially if you are a older, slightly older, the middle-aged white man, apparently Fox has some sort of kinetic force on you and all of a sudden you can't not watch it, then it continues the cycle. So yeah, it's and I think it just requires such an amount of effort from the consumer standpoint. And that's the quote, that's one of my favorite things about financial markets.

But yeah, back to bulls, I think that's also going to be really industry-specific what you're highlighting. But yeah, I think the misprice in common is difficult. I don't know how you, I don't know how you price it. How do you price it? I definitely would be open to learning about it. I mean, I can think of obviously a bunch of conceptual ways to price it, but my broader point is to accurately price it is a straight crapshoot. Is that Benian or Benian? That's a hell of a name. Benian, what do you think of the VIX closing at 45? Did not see that happens since 2020. Should we expect way more downside? Not inherently. So the cool part when VIX is here is that there's a ton of trades that you can do with VIX at these levels. The VIX, again, doesn't tell us downside or upside. The VIX tells us one key thing, uncertainty. That's what VIX is, uncertainty.

And right now, this is the funniest thing is last week, everybody was saying, oh, we just need the tariffs to come out so that we know what's going on. And the argument that I made last week during multiple live streams is that when this shit comes out, everybody's going to lose their fucking minds. And then there might be a little bit of known in terms of the tariffs are turned on. But now everybody's questioning a million other things. How long are they on? How receptive to negotiations are we like all of these other things? It's hilarious to me. So what you're seeing here is exactly that. You're seeing the market being hyper uncertain. Now there is one thing I'm pretty confident here. If Trump came out with the tariffs and the tariffs came in more in line with general expectations across the board, not a 10 tariff across everybody. You wouldn't likely have seen this move. It would have been very unlikely to see that move. But the reason why you see this kind of massive run is because the tariffs came out heavier, way heavier than expected. So that led to the near term price dislocation that we talked about last week.

As that near term price dislocation is rapidly being priced in during a volatile environment, you're going to see things expand, right? It's the rubber band thing. And when things start to get super far out of whack like they were, expectations positioning versus what happened, that move gets magnified. So I don't inherently think that there's going to be, you know, plummeting downside just because of this. Now again, to give you Eric's opinion, I do think there's likely more downside because the positioning for larger entities takes time, as I've mentioned. And the overall move has been pretty quick and severe, but it would not surprise me if it's not done. It's probably going to take a little bit more time. Take a look at the move on Friday. It was a 3.6 standard deviation move. Huge, absolutely huge standard deviation. Joseph says, I heard from a financial professional impossible to price uncertainty. Yeah, I actually think that's a really dumb statement, to be honest with you. Like the stock market is really good, typically at pricing uncertainty, right? Like a lot of what the stock market does is price uncertainty. And that's through things like volatility. In volatility, we know a lot of the standard behaviors of volatility.

But I think that the sentiment of not being able to price uncertainty, honestly, is just kind of silly. The market does it all the time. That's what the market, that's one of the primary things that the market does do. It's just that when there's a lot of uncertainty and then there's a dislocation, it gets a ton of press. It's like the same thing you saw with all the airplane crashes, which you don't pray for me because I'm flying soon. So hopefully, we have a successful series of flights. But the main thing is we become hyper focused on these plane crashes. And it leads everybody to believe that there's plane crashes happening all over the place all the time. Everybody's dying in these plane crashes. And then if you actually look at the statistics, it's really not that bad. Still sucks. And every single one of them really is terrible, right?

Dark Gents is another point of discussion is that even if reshoring happens, assuming other the costs are fixed by virtue, having more expensive labor in the US versus a third country, then wouldn't margins just by default increase in earnings go down not inherently. No, not inherently. It depends on the company and it depends on how they're structured. It depends on what they do. I absolutely would expect cost in general to go up. But it doesn't inherently mean that margins have to contract and that revenue is going to go to shit.

Wait, is it Jose or Hozui? Hey, H hooked it up with the phonetics. Yeah, you just said your name again that didn't help me. Dark Jens says, yeah, that's true of production shifts towards more efficient centric focus, more automation. Yeah, and that's exactly what's going to happen. The other thing is I have to be honest with you. The fact that people are sitting here freaking out about trying to and the disruption that it causes to move companies like Apple, more to domestic production, I really lament the fact that Americans are so coddled. They're so entitled and so sheltered that we prioritize being able to buy an iPhone for 2,000, I don't even know what to cost. 2,000 versus 3,500 bucks. And because we care so much about that, we really fail to appreciate the human side of this. And what again, like the human element of what's going on there with the actual people building these fucking phones. So that's a complete opinion piece.

Um, James says, I get that tariffs are causing big big spike, but how much is powel driving this? Isn't that a big big spike in August his? One of the things to remember is that again, just just to remind everybody like discrete attachments is a fool's errand. I really would get out of the habit of doing that immediately because like saying that this big spike is from tariffs and saying that the August spike is from powel. I don't think you can attribute it that way. Now I understand your point fully by the way that we're trying to assign at least a dominant cause. And I think it's okay to do that. But I just think it's very common for people to then habitually try and come up with the, you know, news article headline on why this happened. Even what you're seeing now, again, like if it was the tariffs and it was just the tariffs, then I would have expected to see more of the big spike on the third. Why did it happen on the fourth?

So it's just important to always remember that. Now again, tariffs, primary driver here completely agree. Now in terms of powel, I don't really see how powel I would be interested in your perspective on how you tie powel to this in what way. Cause I mean realistically, powel doesn't have a dog in this current fight with respect to what tariffs are and the immediate fiscal response from the Fed on tariffs. I guess I should say policy response, not fiscal response out, right? So yeah, I'm curious what the, what the perspective is there because I think powel is done so far, literally exactly what I would expect them to. I think when we look at the market movement right now, it's not just the impact of tariffs, I don't think. I think that you're also seeing a lot of people trying to discount into the future, what this can turn into, which we don't know. And I think that's a big part of what's going on here.

And I told you exactly why that was happening. That's one of those instances that there is a pretty clear reason is to what's happening. And the reason was there was a lot of people that were unsure what was going to happen to what magnitude. So then they moved cash. They moved to cash to wait and see because they, there's no sense in being a hero there and taking on the risk and hoping shit works out. So because of that kind of behavior, I think a lot of what you're seeing here is also defensive positioning. And the tariff side of stuff isn't, I mean, that's part of this equation. We haven't even mentioned the word recession. Haven't even mentioned it yet. But that is another thing that is looming. The current rate environment is still a thing.

To which, on my, my opinion on that is I, I just don't see it. And it's because the amount of technology that's going to be launching and especially if there's a really strong driver for faster adoption, I think that starts to become incredibly powerful. So so yeah, anyways, James, the synopsis of all that is I don't think that you can directly attribute any of this to any one thing, especially Powell. I think Powell is part of this. But Powell has been one of, if not the most consistent in messaging that I could think of, to be honest, it has been, he's been so consistent in his messaging, which is absolutely worth noting because that helps the market tremendously because again, the market does struggle when things are uncertain.

And then obviously the yield side of the equation. But again, you could typically tell that there's generally a reason, right? So in this case, the reason is actually pretty easy to see. It obviously has to do with the not additional tariffs going on lumber and whatnot. I don't know. Dark Jen says, with the rapid increase of VIX suggests that the market was not sufficiently hedged, the rapid downside perhaps could lead to margin calls coming Monday, but I don't have sufficient knowledge. Well, I think I think a few things related to that. It's really difficult to say like what is sufficiently hedged, right?

    "text": "I don't have sufficient knowledge. Well, I think I think a few things related to that. It's really difficult to say like what is sufficiently hedged, right? But because there was so much lead in coming to this, again, I already talked about the ETF flows and the massive outflows that we saw just across the board. So I mean, could we argue that there was some sort of change in terms of total investment picture? Yeah, definitely. I think that that's pretty fair to at least costulate. But one of the things that causes really broad market friction is when, like for example, margin calls might happen, but if they're occurring across the board and there's a lot of them, and they're all coalescing together, right? Like that's where it becomes really difficult. But there wasn't really a massive surprise here in the sense of like the market knew something was coming up. The market knew. And they we obviously didn't know what it was going to look like and how bad it was going to be in that kind of stuff. But it's not like everybody went into that just, hoping everything was okay. I mean, if you did, that's just probably a retail trader mistake. Because going into the event, I had long straddles just playing the volatility. And then I also, you all have seen the coverage strangle allocations that I've had coming into this. It's been 30 or less of an equity position in them.",

So I think a lot of the market probably had an idea that something was going on. Now, this does lead to an interesting question though that we can speculate, which is if we take a look, let's take a look at options, behavior leading into the second. And we can answer this actually a little bit. So here's the second. Let's look at the prior week. So we'll do March 24th. And we'll go into, no, I don't want to go into the second. So why would I click it again? You idiot. I was about to click it a third time. And let's see. So this is looking at the VIX. And then we'll take a look at SP or spy probably after this versus SP. Let's see. But that's like dead center. Don't know. Also like dead center. Don't know. This is closer to the offer. So this is probably buying. Pretty close to the center. Tough to tell. But this is probably buying. Interesting. Let's take a look first, I guess at a broad angle. So here's the second. Yeah, I mean, the options activity, you can",

You can definitely see the call buying pickup here leading into the second. So the market definitely was picking up on elements of that. Because that's a pretty big change. But this is just looking at an individual company. So let's take a look at VIX now. And let's see what VIX was seeing. Yeah. The market had an idea. Sneaky suspicion. Take a look at that. Huge. Absolutely huge. The let's go back further. I'm actually curious when even the closest reference day might have been. Yeah, man. Literally for the last month, there is nothing even close. Take a look at the VIX activity. These are just buying calls. These are people expecting a spike with certainty. So I actually would think that the market seemed to be pretty well positioned for it. I would say that. Manscapes says is black money even possible with circuit breakers? Well, no, not the same move at all. But I mean, the what is it? 20 down that's still pretty significant.

But again, the other thing I remember is just the conditions of black Monday. They were obviously just anonymously unique compared to what we've seen. Now I always remind you that the worst days are ahead of us. It's just important to have that mindset. You don't have the mindset of the worst days are ahead of you. Then you step into a pretty precarious position worth avoiding, I would say. I'm making sure I'm all caught up on the chat. It is. Rudebegis says VIX should drop relatively quickly, right? Puts are crazy expensive, not inherently. So VIX can cluster. And that's one of the key properties of VIX is that it does cluster. Now how long it clusters is another question. But for example, let's go back. I have to open this up a bit more. Let's do this be enough. Just enough. Let's go a little further. So let's just do some eyeball in here. So periods where VIX touched above 25 here. That was nine days, two days, two, six days. And",

So the point is VIX can remain elevated. It is entirely dependent on the actual market condition and what's going on. But one of the things to remember is that volatility does cluster. And when it clusters, that means it can stay in a specific range again, typically for a list of reasons. A lot of it has to do with expanding uncertainty. So yeah. Lauren says, what do you think about Jimmy going up 11? Yeah, stick a look at GameStop now. I want to make sure we have a little time to talk about what's popping here. So for GameStop, it had obviously a really interesting move and it looked to be for a few reasons. So first thing.

This is also a really funny comment that I've seen people saying in different ways. Because Buffy sitting on 300 million is like as a percentage of really small amount. People are making it like, oh, this is why it all makes sense. Buffy is so prescient because he's been sitting on so much cash because you knew something bad was going to happen. This is not smirching Buffy at all. He's super smart. But the reason why he's sitting on so much fucking cash is that he has a hard time using it. He's talked about that. And if you look at like, it's not like Buffy was sitting in 40 cash in Berkshire. This is still a small amount of cash relative to the total size of Berkshire. So people, this is an artifact of people's simple brain. And it's that they see a big number. And I'm not saying Ryan Cohen is simple.",

That's why I'm talking about it. We see 300 billion and everybody thinks like, oh, my God, like that's just an insane amount of money to be holding in cash. But as soon as you put it into context, I've like the size of the portfolio really isn't much. So and let me not leave you without at least an answer there. So Berkshire, Pathaway current value. Well, I guess I'll just do the math. I just got three different answers, which made me mad. Wait, what are his current holdings actually? All right, holdings because I know he unwound some of his apple, apple position. Let's see. So first things first, this is saying that he's sitting on 267 trillion dollars. And we're saying he has 300 billion. So let's see. Let's see where we're at. So that's 300 million. 1000. What's your guess? What's the percentage of cash that he has right now? And he guesses big numbers. Big numbers are kind of fun to guess in this way. This is saying 267 trillion dollars. Well, I'm sorry, 267",

Big numbers are kind of fun to guess in this way. This is saying 267 trillion dollars. Well, I'm sorry, 267 billion. What am I saying? Hold on, I am super confused. I just got myself all in a tizzy because this now doesn't make sense. Is he in way more cash than I thought? Hold up. So this is saying 260. Hold on. Yeah, let's now we do it to fact check this because this got me fucked up. So the holdings is of 31 ds 24, which I think is a little too late. Okay, so the Berkshire market capitalization is 1.064 trillion. This seemed way too small. What is this portfolio currently worth? I'm using another website to... This says 267 billion as well. I'm so confused. This says 255 billion. 255 billion on 334 billion. And then 1 trillion is the market cap? Is this just his basis? What is this? How much money does this fucking guy have? How much money you got? Let's see what this says. Although Berkshire's stockway, half the way stock portfolio, 288 billion. So what's the total market cap? Total value. 1.07 trillion. Yo, I'm getting fucking grumpy with these. Because I definitely think it's over trillion dollars. I know it's not just hundreds of billions. That's fucking peanuts for him.",

Yo, I'm getting fucking grumpy with these. Because I definitely think it's over trillion dollars. I know it's not just hundreds of billions. That's fucking peanuts for him. And this is 334, 2. So let's just do it on this really quick out of curiosity. Yeah, 31, 31 cash. So using the 1.06 trillion from here, that shows him 30 cash. So if you think about that even in context, like 30 cash is heavy for a fund, but it's not like he's sitting again, like I said, like 40 plus and cash. 40 is when you're really guarding money, that objectively, when you're looking at a fund this size, that's trying to put on positions. Because again, take a look at the size of the positions. This is the difficulty and I've mentioned this before. Here, we literally have a 5.2 billion dollar position in DVA. And it's 2.1. It's difficult enough to find the liquidity to put on a 5.2 billion dollar position. And it's only making up 2.1 of the portfolio. That's a bit challenging. So that's one of the main reasons why you'll see Berkshire sitting on a lot of cash. It's literally hard to use the cash. Now, going back to the behavior, though, in GameStop, I think a big thing that you see here is the fact that Cohen had bought in.",

Now, going back to the behavior, though, in GameStop, I think a big thing that you see here is the fact that Cohen had bought in. The other thing that was going on here is that there was more news about Trump's discussing of Bitcoin and his use of it. This is going back a little ways. And Friday was actually one of the first periods that we saw Bitcoin serving as an alternative asset for the broader market. So if we take a look at Bitcoin, which now GameStop is discussed, building a position. And so now that's relevant. So you can see Bitcoin actually had a little bit of a positive day on Friday when the rest of the stuff was going down pretty heavy. And again, it's showing a slightly different behavior and relationship. So when I look at GameStop, it's still in this really, really, really broad decline. And this is the first sign that we've really gotten about approaching a potential bottom, the fact that we had a low posted here, a low posted here. And then it's kind of still rallying sideways against this 20 and a half handle. So the pricing of GameStop right now is actually not too bad, I don't think.

Now, funny enough, this is another ticker that I might do the thing that I was explaining to you all on yesterday. I think it was yesterday we're talking about it, which is moving between equity and option position because right now I have 41 invested for the coverage triangle in GameStop at a basis of 2575. So the open PL on that is not bad. What is that 900 loss with GameStop at 23.49? So it's about a 900 loss that's sitting on the open stock. Let me show you the existing position so that you can follow along with me. Here. Maybe it's easier if I just look at this one. There we go. So right now, this is what the GameStop position looks like. We're short three of the 26 strikes in 16 May. We have two short calls at the 29 in 16 May. And we have this 400 shares at 2575. So right now, there's a thing that I'm looking at doing, which allows me to take the shares off and move back into a short put position. And again, to recap what that looks like, I will show you here because it's actually kind of an important maneuver for me. It's one of the primary ways that I can navigate",

So here's likely what I will end up doing. It kind of depends again. I'm the reason why I haven't done it yet is because again, I'll be moving around a little bit. So I'm not going to be on top of the market quite as much. But what I will do is I'm going to move this out of the way for now. And I'm going to look for opportunities to probably move it back into an options position. So using around 93. 96. So here it will look something like this. So we have expiration. We have strike. We have premium. We have lot size. So let's take a look at the 16 May. Strike will start with something like the 22. Maybe the 23. So the 23, the premium on those is 240. Five-ish.

If the underlying starts going up and I'm concerned about missing out, I have two different courses of action I can follow. The first one is either just simply rebuy the stock. I generally will set an alert to do that. The second thing is just by calls. Now the whole purpose for this maneuver is because when you buy shares, your basis is fixed. It is what it is. But when you're in options, I can do things like roll the short puts. So that if GameStop does unfortunately continue some sort of downward move, I have places I can go. I have things I can do. Whereas if your basis is 25.75 and GameStop goes to 20, well, your basis is just 25.75. And keep up is at 20. There's just nothing going on there. So this here is actually a pretty useful maneuver. The other thing that you'll notice is that it actually reduces my total risk. Because even right now losing 905, the value of the position is 9400. I'm only going to use 9200. So it's not that much, right? But it's a 200 difference. So I would have 200 less in this position than I would otherwise, which again can be used to buy shares if I just want to get into it as it's starting to move. So there's actually two tickers that I'm looking at",

It's obviously still digesting the Bitcoin news, which I think my honest opinion is I think the Bitcoin news is more of, I don't want to call it like a visual act. It seems a little bit more for branding and publicity, in my opinion, than something that will meaningfully enhance the business. So, yeah, I mean, it's not bad. I don't think it's bad for it to hold some Bitcoin. But the thing I will continue to remind people in general is it's a company. It needs to have revenue. Bitcoin is not revenue. Bitcoin can appreciate. Bitcoin can also depreciate. So I'm bullish in Bitcoin, by the way. So I don't think it's a bad ad to the balance sheet.

Because right now, they're showing small things along the way. But nothing that I would consider too massive. Let's see what we got. I tend to agree about Bitcoin. We'd love to see investments in based on their filings. I thought RC wanted to function as holding. What do you make of volumes in GameStop? Well, I think the volumes in GameStop have to do with first earnings. And then I think the announcement about the debt offering impacts it. I also think Cohen's purchase obviously impacts it. So I think it's a few things that you'll see driving the movement in GameStop broadly and then also the volume. So I think the problem with GameStop is a holding company. I struggle to see that angle. Because if GameStop, again, like in my opinion, if GameStop was going to be a holding company, I don't know why they would not just unwind the physical locations then, just close them. They're closing the unprofitable ones. But if that's the ultimate angle that they're going to go and do a spin off, the other thing",

But to me, there would be nothing wrong with, again, Google and Alphabet, right, building a parent company that holds GameStop. Let GameStop continue to be what GameStop is. It has good branding, good brand loyalty, good consumer side. And then if you want it to be a broader holding company that sits over it, that's borne essentially out of it, then you could do that. But I don't see the actual benefit here in like turning GameStop into a holding company because it still is a brick and mortar institution. And while it is that, and it does have obviously an online presence, but being a brick and mortar institution has its own whole list of things. This is the same thing with Berkshire. Berkshire is a great example. Berkshire owns a bunch of companies, and it has controlling stakes in a lot of companies. But the individual companies are still the companies, not like progressive, or one of the other insurance companies that Berkshire owns turned into Berkshire.

The investor relations website between Berkshire and GameStop, and there's a change there. So I do think that they're hinting towards. There could be some version of that. But in my mind, that would look more as launching a parent company that then GameStop would be a component of versus turning GameStop into the holding company itself. It's my broader guess. Darchon, what are your thoughts on Soxel? Do you mind taking a quick look? Seems like once in a lifetime dip. I don't think it's a once in a lifetime dip. And stuff like this can go down, and it can continue going down. And I actually think this is probably in one of the more, like really one of the more difficult areas, meaning industries. Because if you think about, again, reshoring, cost, building chips is super expensive. And it requires super tight tolerances, yada, yada, yada.

It never even got back to all time highs, following the massive spike from 2020. It peaked out here, and it hasn't gotten back. So this is the problem with three times leverage. And this is also why when you see me trading things like T-Triple Q's, I have a very specific approach that heavily relies on the ability, again, to move in and out of the equity position. And it's because you can get moves like this, where it just recently recaptured highs. So for a comparison, just to give you some context, if you look at QQQ, and you look at T-TUs, and let's zoom these out, let's do five year weekly in both. What do you notice? Difference here.

If you didn't top-ticket and hold, or if you did top-ticket and you have like I do, a specific momentum following approach that naturally starts scaling you out in your highs like this. And as it's rotating down, you start nibbling on the way down, you use short puts. Then you start rolling the short puts to get as good of a basis as you can before finally choosing to take assignment. Then all of a sudden, rather than your basis being up here at 91, your basis might be down here at like 38.

It's just picking up little clues here and there and making educated guesses. So it's very much TBD. All right, Gang, I got to go pack, good hanging out. If you need anything, you can always drop in the discord, even if I'm not going to be as around as I typically would be, there's plenty of people in there that are happy to help however they can and plenty of folks that have been around for a while. So they can pick it up. Be an outlier. Don't let the market get you. Pay attention out there. See you guys later.",
