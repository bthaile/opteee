    "text": "what's up outliers a quick gme update keeping the Cadence alive here this should be a fast one because well a a couple things happened but none of it is super great in my opinion unfortunately so we did see GameStop have a fair down day 5 down and it hovered right around 22 a halfish right now after hours it's at 22 54x 58 and we have now fallen below at least what iew viewed as some near-term support so now the question becomes in my opinion how far down does it go you already see from the recent conversation we have this would be the next Target I see online which would be about 21 and that's just trying to find where people are transacting in the stock but unfortunately you can see here that this is where it corresponds on the volume node about right there and the volume node just waines and this is where it's actually the lightest which is at like 18 and A2 so what that tells me unless buyers step in in some sort of really meaningful way uh I wouldn't be overly surprised if the selling continued is really what go down to as much as I don't like saying that the other thing is if I look at the volume for today you can see if you look right at this spot when I bring it over today you'll see that the uh the sale volume today was 96 so",
