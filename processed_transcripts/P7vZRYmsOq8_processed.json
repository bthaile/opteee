Like right now it's 2022. It's a bear market. We've had a down year, however, I'm up on the year. And it's not because I'm a magician. It's simply because I have different tools that I can apply to different scenarios. I'm not stuck just doing one or two things, hoping that the market lines up with those. What's up everybody? Eric here. Let's talk about some strategies. So first I'm going to give my stupid face out the way. And we're going to talk about the first one, which is probably not surprising to anybody here. The covered ratio of strangle. You're going to see this term ratio multiple times throughout this. And it's because I purposefully use ratios to create different risk to reward profiles. And this is what I'm talking about. So the first trade we have here is a short put. And this is the payoff. It's a max profit of the credit received. So that's why it has a capped max profit and technically unlimited downside. Now one note on these short puts that I want to make sure it's abundantly clear is I purposely put short puts not cash secured puts. And the reason why I don't put cash secured puts here is because some people think that if it's a cash",

And the reason why I don't put cash secured puts here is because some people think that if it's a cash secure put, then we're parking the cash that we're going to use for that trade. If we get assigned and just waiting to see whether or not that happens, that is not at all what I used to do. At this point, I generally do that because I have enough room in the portfolio. But when I was aggressively growing my account trading things like this, the money that I would earmark to take assignment if I, if the option expired in the money and I received the stock. In that scenario, I would typically have that money out doing something else, whether it's a box spread, whether it's being tied up in another trade and to cover early assignment. If it happened, I would rely on margin for the account pay the interest on the margin until I could free up the capital to bring over to this that I originally had earmarked. So to summarize that when I was aggressively growing the account, my short puts were not sitting there cash secured. I would use the money elsewhere.

I would have the money earmarked to use in this trade when I need it. I typically would expect in plan to free up that money towards expiration. So that did leave me early expiration risk and I needed to make sure I had enough room in the portfolio to at least be able to take on the shares via margin. Now let's talk about that scenario. There's two outcomes with this short put. The first one it expires out of the money and you just do it again. Or if it expires in the money and we take assignment that leads to this scenario. And that's what this looks like down here. We have now long stock because we would have bought it at whatever the strike price was keeping the credit. And then I sell calls against it just like a covered call and then additional short puts. So in the scenario, sometimes the short puts go on right away. Sometimes they get layered on later. It all depends on the underlying. But the main thing I'm trying to avoid is this. So in this scenario, I'm pretending that I have 200 shares of long stock and this short put on top of that, we have this one short call. So I have one short call here, 200",

So in this scenario, I'm pretending that I have 200 shares of long stock and this short put on top of that, we have this one short call. So I have one short call here, 200 long shares over here. And that's why we do not have a cap to upside. Whereas if we look over here, this is using 200 or 100 shares, but the same amount of short calls. So if this is 200 long shares of stock, even with that additional put, this is 200 or two short calls against it. And sooner or later, you're going to cap out your max profit. I don't want to do that. So that's exactly why I trade these as I do without capping the profit potential. So these live within my core allocation, meaning this is really how I make a lot of my money over time. They're bullish in their nature. I want the underlying to go up through all stages of trading this. And I put volatility in different. The reason why I put volatility in different is because when we're selling short puts, if we have higher volatility, it's a good thing because you're going to collect a little bit more money. But it also means that you're going to have higher variance in the underlying movements, which means even though you're getting paid more, you're probably going to have to adjust",

But it also means that you're going to have higher variance in the underlying movements, which means even though you're getting paid more, you're probably going to have to adjust the trade more frequently as compared to low volatility environment. So it's a trade off. That's why I don't say this is better for high IVP environments. I get paid a little bit more, but there's a diminishing return. So I prefer implied volatility percentile to be maybe 30 to 40 percent, something like that. And as soon as it starts getting over that, I'm going to make more money, but I'm going to have to deal with the trade more. So it's a bit of a delicate balance. And I will trade this strategy, even if implied volatility is low, it's not better for the strategy. It's not the ideal scenario, but because it is a core allocation and because there's a period of time where you have long stock, which doesn't really care about volatility, that is why I label this implied volatility indifferent. All right, let's get on to the next one here. So we have ratio diagonals. Again, that same ratio thing that we're talking about. And this works for calls or puts.

And this is how I can easily, directionally trade bull and bear markets. So in this scenario, if we have a trending bull market using the call diagonal gives us upside potential. And again, this ratio is so important because the ratio unlocks unlimited profit potential, whereas if we look at this version with the regular diagonal sooner or later, you find yourself in this scenario where you actually can start losing money. Even though you're a direction that you selected is correct, you can still start losing money. So this is exactly why I prefer to trade them at a ratio. And again, to set up this long call diagonal, typically ratio diagonal, typically I'm going to go further out in time for the long call, like maybe at least 180 days plus. And I'm going to go deep in the money. And then I'm going to sell short calls against it shorter term. And it's the same thing for the put side just inverse.

And then again, this can be bullish or bearish environments. And again, I call this volatility indifferent. I use volatility indifferent because there are tradeoffs here. So the reason the core position here is the long option that's far out in time and deep in the money. Vega or changes in volatility do not impact the price of those options that much. That is the heart and soul of the position. But regardless, the long option is going to prefer in general lower volatility because if volatility expands, you can make money via it. So there's that side. But then we also have the short call or short put that we're selling against the long call or the long put respectively. And that would prefer high implied volatility. So generally speaking, this is going to be your short near term option. It's going to be way more sensitive to changes in volatility. So there's a benefit there.

But overall, I will still trade these in varying volatility environments. It's not necessarily the heart and soul of the trade. Let's move on now to the next one. Let's talk about short single options. These take a pretty different shape for me. This is when I want to trade directionally. So if we have a high volatility environment that's trending one way or the other, I will use short calls or short puts to take advantage of it. Now notice in this scenario, I most certainly have a volatility preference. I want implied volatility percentile to be high. And it's because a major part of this trade is the movements in volatility. Whereas with these trades, they have different aspects that benefit from different portions of volatility movements. These not so much. Even though if I sell a short, call a short put, again, there is a higher probability that I'm going to have to deal with it at some point. Because if we have high implied volatility percentile, we're expecting bigger moves, that's a big part of the compensation for these trades. So these are definitely speculative. This is when I want to get directional. And again,",

I bucket these into the same category essentially because it's a similar concept just like differences. And this is when we're going to sell a call and put typically in the same expiration cycle. If we're doing straddles, it's going to be in the same series and it's going to look like this. It's going to have a peaky top. If strangles, it's going to have more of this flat top. And it's just because for short straddles, we're going to use the same strike, trying to get as close to the same delta on the call and put side. Whereas for the strangles, we typically are going to pick, you know, same delta's, but I'm sorry, the same figure delta, but on the respective side.

For short strangles, I might do a 3040 delta call and a 3040 delta short put. So it's going to put them at staggered strike prices as compared to the straddles. And this ratio, I apply to both. If I have a pure volatility play in my mind, I'm going to gravitate towards a straddle, but if I have a slight directional preference, but I still want to play volatility very directly, I sometimes will skew the straddle less likely than not. More often than not, I'm going to go with strangles if I have some sort of preference for direction. So more often than not, these are going to be speculative trades specifically for volatility, not so much. I don't expect the market to move.

I want to see a big variance between implied volatility and historic volatility specifically, where implied volatility is tracking higher than historic volatility. That is the name of the game.

This didn't work in my favor, but I used the long calls to essentially serve as my risk management, meaning I had to define risk moving into the trade. It's cryptocurrency. They move a lot and I fully expected it to be a shit show. So I use long call instead of buying the stock and setting a stop. I wanted to give it enough room to move. So in this case, I used options to gain exposure to that. The problem with using long singles to speculate on direction is even though you think you're speculating on direction. You are still speculating on volatility and that cannot be overstated enough. If you are trading long single options just because you want to more efficiently in terms of capital use, gain exposure, directional exposure to an underlying to trade a hypothesis, regardless of how you feel about the direction, volatility still is a big say in this scenario. So in this example, notice what I have down here. I'm not necessarily just looking for low implied volatility. I prefer low implied volatility because similarly to short single options, it will increase my overall profitability if I get an implied volatility movement in my favor.
