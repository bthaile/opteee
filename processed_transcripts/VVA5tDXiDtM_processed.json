    "text": "Contrary to popular belief options are not fast easy money. All of those YouTube videos and TikTok videos that you see about people making thousands of dollars in three to five minutes, it's complete not a bullshit. They're actually just looking to monetize your attention and probably get you to buy some bullshit course that's not going to work or do anything. That's the reality of traded. Trading is entirely entirely capable of completely changing your life. It is absolutely changed money, but it's not easy. It's like anything else that there's a really significant reward on the other side of. Typically, it's a lot of work to get to it because if it's fast easy money, who wouldn't do it? And then more so, who would take the other side of your trade? Nobody doesn't make any sense. So while trading can absolutely make you a ton of money if you're good at it, it's not easy. If you're going to it with that mindset, you're probably going to have trouble being all alone. See you later.",
