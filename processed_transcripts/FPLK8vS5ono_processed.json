Every once in a while I have to lay down for a little bit and try to reset the clock on it before it starts hurting like a mother. What's up everybody? I hope we are off to a great week. The, I don't know, last trading week was pretty interesting. I got to say. So I'm excited to talk a little bit about that. And we have a couple of questions that were sent in that I want to make sure we hit also. There it is. Like I couldn't see my stuff for a second. Looks like we are up and running. Perfect. Sweet. So let me grab. There is actually a comment. There was a comment on the post that I want to hit. It was a great question. So for those that don't know when we use the YouTube studio for some reason, it doesn't let me see community comments. I can only see it on my phone. I'll just read it from the phone. So agenda for today, pretty simple. What I want to cover first is we do have a quiz that I want to work through with you all. Then I want to take a look at, well, I guess we'll start with some of the questions. Then we'll do the quiz. And then we'll kind of navigate around depending on what",

We're pivoting away from the really structured learning components. If you've missed any of those, go back to the first episode in this whole playlist. And we have literally like a comprehensive rundown of what we've learned so far, which was in the beginning very, very structured. You know about like the basics. So let me grab this chat so I can say hello to everybody. And it looks like Reese's here, Shrej is here, Dr. Zayas Joey Pollo, H Jonathan and Mary Shell. Beautiful. We got the gang in town. Mary Shell, where's the quiz? I will post it into the chat. So we will look at the quiz together. It's designed that most of the questions are going to be open. I like open-ended questions. I don't like multiple choice. I know that they're easier for like a teacher to grade. But in order to evaluate a thought process, it's much harder to navigate the nuance of things.

I have to pull it up on the phone because I can't get it from the studio. And it says, this is from Lord Slothable, which is a fantastic name. We have to give a shout out to Lord Slothable. And they say, I'm having trouble figuring out the difference between a covered option and a single option where there is only one leg in the strike. Now the last part of that only one leg in the strike, that doesn't make sense, which we'll talk about. But we can definitely grasp onto the meat of this question, which is a covered option versus a single option. So first thing for you, Mr. Lord Slothable, is a covered option and a single option actually are not disparate things. And we'll take a look at an example together. So if we're trading TLT, just because that happens to be what I have up right now. And if we look at a single option, we can do essentially four things for a single option. We can come in here and we can buy a call. We can sell a call. We can buy a put. Or we",

Now all of those single options can have different risk profiles that make them covered or uncovered, which for uncovered, we've referred to that as naked. Those are really the two buckets. So you can have a single option that's either covered or naked in its context dependent. So an example of a covered option is if I go in here to sell this put and I have the cash set aside to buy 100 shares at my strike price. That would be covered. Another example of a covered option, you wouldn't really refer to it as a covered option, but it inherently is so is if you buy that put. It's covered because as soon as you pay your debit, that's your max risk on the trade. It can't lose more than that. That's all there is to it. Now you can have another scenario where if we sell this put and we have a stock position that actually covers us technically or you can do the same thing on the call side.

So if I sell a call and it's just a short call, we would call that a naked short call. And that means that we don't have any underlying to cover it. It means that it's just a naked short call. It's an option that's out alone and unafraid. Normally when we refer to naked options, we would refer to that in the context of selling them. And when we're buying them colloquially, we would refer to them as singles, a long option whatever. But the nuances when we're talking about a covered option is normally that's going to be a short option that's paired with something. So for example, if we have a short call and we look at the risk profile on this short call, you'll see that it has unlimited risk because the underlying can go up into perpetuity and there's nothing that stops it. Now we can have a covered call and the context of a covered call would be if we have shares that then cap our risk. That's what a covered call would be.

There will be short options that have some sort of other trade associated with it that decreases the total risk profile from an unlimited potential risk. Now this idea of like unlimited risk versus defined risk, I actually think it's important to talk about that because this one is actually really confusing to people. So and these are actually some of our quiz questions. So we'll start with your first quiz question here, which is if I sell a put, does this is this undefined risk or is this defined risk? If I sell a put is this undefined risk or defined risk? And the reason I asked this question is you'll you'll get a sense in a second, but I want to root out the difference between how we colloquially talk about options and then what the actual reality is. So naked short put is that risk defined or risk undefined. And he guesses and there's two different answers to this one. Joey says undefined but technically defined since as a floor. Yep, that's correct. So for Cedar Savage is also correct, Robo is also correct. Joey is definitely the most correct out of these. So for Elon songs also correct. So for Cedar Savage,",

So for Cedar Savage, Robo and Elon songs, are you familiar with the second part that Joey is talking about that we refer to it is undefined, but it actually is defined. You guys know why that's the case. And again, this is why I want to talk about this because there's nuance in the language. Robo says no, Elon songs says limited risk, that's it. So a stock can go to zero. Where does it go pass zero? Right? It gets buried. It's not a commodity, something like oil crude oil futures that have a commodity component. They can go negative because there's storage costs, there's transportation costs, there's insurance on the barrels of oil themselves. That is not case here. So this stock can only go to zero. So we call it undefined risk, but it's not undefined risk, it's completely defined. Sooner or later, this will you go to zero. You can't go below zero with these equities. So does that part make sense? With respect to the slight nuance between defined and undefined risk, when we're talking about something like a naked short put, that we would call it colloquially is undefined risk, but it actually is defined.

    "text": "can't go below zero with these equities. So does that part make sense? With respect to the slight nuance between defined and undefined risk, when we're talking about something like a naked short put, that we would call it colloquially is undefined risk, but it actually is defined. Vladimir Putin says the strike is the floor, not the strike, but it would be the stock going to zero. That's the floor. Okay, cool. So we're good there. Now what about an inverse scenario? What if we sell a call? Is this defined or undefined? All of the same thought processes before. Joey says unlimited. Seater says true undefined. Robo says totally undefined. Policies undefined. Okay, great questions or kind of great inputs. Is there, Lord's Lothable, we hit your, I don't know if you caught the answer, we actually hit your question like right at the beginning. So if you want to rewind, if you missed it, you can go back, check it out. Vladimir Putin says again, covered call, nope, this is just a short call. We're talking about a short call. And so far, Joey, Seater, Robo, Polo, H all say undefined. So here's the follow on question. And again, this is pedantic, but I want the point to be made, because I think it's an important consideration. Are there unlimited resources on planet earth? So if we think about the value of everything that exists, is it unlimited or is there a limited amount of value that",

Seater says the spaceship earth, okay. Limited resource, but we make a value. Joey says sure, but what is the limit? It's actually undefined, but limited. Exactly. Joey has the exact nuance I'm hunting for there. So Polo says if you consider IP, there's no upper bound. Again, when we talk about value, it's not the value that I place on something. I could say my value is Eric is 10 billion. If there's not a counterparty that agrees that my value is 10 billion, there's no market. So to your point, I can value myself at whatever I want, but what makes undefined value is the counterparty that confirms that value, otherwise it's just a number.

So all I'm highlighting is that when we're looking at this idea of defined undefined risk, we use the terms undefined colloquially. We use them as a shortcut, a bypass. It's just a little faster than to say that there's a bunch of value and we don't know where it is. We just say undefined, even to the downside that clearly has a zero, it's the same thing to the upside. Sooner or later, value that you run out of how high a company can achieve a market cap, again, we don't currently have unlimited market cap companies and we never will, because sooner or later they will hit some sort of pinnacle of value that they can provide before they erode. So that's a really extreme example, not super applicable here. The main point I'm trying to highlight with this example though is the nuance of when we talk about things like defined versus undefined risk. That's all. Each says so then whatever counterparty is willing to pay above your strike is the upper bound limit willing forced. Yeah, I mean realistically speaking, this is when I take this into a more realistic example, do you know what your risk is defined to the upside? Because it is defined. It's",

Any guesses? It depends on the plan. Nope, it's not wrong, but that's not the example I'm using. Your broker. Your broker will liquidate your account. That's where it's defined. Now where that point is, we'll depend on the broker. We'll depend on the size of the account. It'll depend on the collateral account. Your broker will not let you hold something to infinity, right? Like your risk is still defined. It's not unlimited risk. Because sooner or later your broker is going to be like margin requirement is up. Marge requirement is up. Marge requirement exceeds your account value. You are now in a margin call. You have X period of time to add capital before I start liquidating your shit for you.

There's a completely theoretical component to learning options, which again, you guys, the theoretical answer is literally on point. Everybody saying totally undefined. It is on point because it can go to infinity where that is and where finite resources on planet earth run out. I don't know, but short of that technically, it can go there. That would define it at some point again and undefined points. You don't know where it is. It's not infinite, but way before we get anywhere near that, your broker is going to close your account done. So that's the nuance when we're talking about define undefined.

They obviously will pursue you to clear their risk, but they are the, they are the counter party. They are responsible for covering the risk. That's why you see things like bank runs, slightly different example, but in the example of a run on a bank, even Silicon Valley, Silicon Valley had the capital, but they weren't liquid enough to provide the capital fast enough. And that's what literally caused that bank to go under. They were completely liable to produce what they needed to produce and they couldn't produce it. Although they had the means to do so. So your broker is 100 on the hook for your risk as a trader. That's why they're very conservative with their margin requirements because they're not just going to take your risk for you. Right? So when we look at something like this and we have this, what is this? This is a short call in TLT. Right now the broker says, again, this is a pass through IRA account. So this is regulation team margin, a little more strict because it's for an IRA account. They were saying, I need 1700 bucks for this position for me to call this good. So yeah, the broker is responsible and they're not going to take the risk for you. G36 says long call short puts bingo. Vladimir off Putin says selling put by Nicole. That's",

Two inputs yield extrinsic value. So Joey and off Putin have one of them, right? They both already hit time value. So exactly. So Joey's got it. I'm in volatility bingo. Good. For everybody else, does that make sense? So when we're talking about the premium of an option, does the premium breakdown make sense? Okay. So we're talking about intrinsic value and follow on question. How do we, how do we figure out an intrinsic value? How do we calculate that? What's the path? It is a pretty straightforward difference between strike and the underlying. Whether it's in the end of money or not. So Dr. Zayis is about right. Fair price minus strike times 100 is incorrect. Joey says amount in the money. That's good. Age says stock price difference for delta value of shares. That's not correct. So this is good example. Let's take a look here.

The way that we calculate, Cedar Savage is directly on fleek. Joey says absolute value. No, because this isn't five dollars in the money. G36 says, I guess it was assumed in the money. Aha. Well, there's no assumption here. We're at the basics level. So this is exactly where we clarify assumptions. It's it's literally based on how far an option is in the money. So for calls, the way we calculated is different than puts. So for what Cedar Savage put above is exactly correct. Depending on if you have a call or if you get a put, we'll determine if you take strike price less stock or stock less strike. So the easier way to think about it is just simply how far in the money are you? How far in the money is in the option is your option? That's your intrinsic value. So if we have a 95 call and the stock is at 100, we would take the stock price of 100, subtract our strike of 95 for the call, you get five dollars. That's how far in the money you",

And right around, I'll throw it down here just to make it easier. So if I go to 110, my 50 delta is going to make 769. My 10 delta is going to make 372. So let's say TLT goes to 200 now. My 10 delta makes 92.79. My 50 delta makes 97.54. So Jonathan is 100 correct. At no point in time, will the 10 delta overwhelm the 50 delta for a one on one basis? And it's because our deltas are limited. The examples that you guys are thinking of when we're considering a large move is when there are more of the further out of the money options because a lot of times when we compare these will compare the same cost. Right? So this cost a dollar 46. This costs 21 cents. So in this case, if I size them to be the same dollar value, then the story is different.

    "text": "So in this case, if I size them to be the same dollar value, then the story is different. So if we do like seven, age says, but the premium paid, it's only a larger percentage move on the option. That's exactly correct. So your option will show a much, much, much higher percent return on a one for one basis. If you do the out of the money option, the further out the 10 delta versus the 50 delta, the 10 delta as I just showed you was going to give you like 9,300 a red average. You only put 21 bucks in to get 9,300 in the scenario with the 50 delta, you put up 146 and you got 97.54. So on a gross dollar amount, you still made more with the at the money, but the percent return for the out of the money will be much higher. The reason why this is so important to understand is because as a trader, you have to be ready to flow in and out in between percent returns, gross returns, how much you're laying out, the behavior of what you're laying out, all of that matters a lot. And traders get too unilaterally minded with their perception of what may or may not perform better for X, Y or Z reason. And it's all about structuring things the way that you want them to behave.

And it's all about structuring things the way that you want them to behave. This is why when I talk about things like the ratio called the Agnal Strategy that I run or the ratio put diagonal strategy that I run that the base position is typically in the money. And the reason for that is I will get a lower percent return on my money, but I get a better dollar for dollar move with the underlying. I will add kicker options if I'm highly convicted that will compound quickly, but those only work if things move in my favor quickly enough. And if they don't, then as long as I get a moderate move, then my position still will probably work out with the higher delta, but it's all a series of trade-offs. So when we look at this, it's important to understand the way that these two different things behave around one another.

So I think we have that one down. Let's talk about this next one. We start to get into slightly more nuanced topics. What is a stock market inefficiency? Now this, I'm not going with the textbook definition because there are like some really, really rigid definitions of it. I don't care so much about that. I want to understand the way that we think about inefficiency. And then I think I have a video I can share on this. An opportunity. Okay, I'll take that. Mispricing capitalized until it's armed out potentially. Define efficiency please. I'm asking you. That's my question to you. And the value doesn't match up across platforms. That could be an example of it. The adverse ass not it. Tom Saudon of the say doesn't exist. That's objectively false. We know that's not true. Follow says a mispricing preferably a tradable one.

Dr. Zayn's market price does not equal intrinsic value of the stock. That's an interesting one. So I'm actually not sure if that would be considered inefficiency personally because the markets are discounting mechanisms. So I literally don't know the answer to that one personally. I'm not sure that I would consider something not trading at or above intrinsic value in inefficiency though because I think that markets are designed to be discounting. So it's a good point. But so think of it this way. When we think about like okay so from inefficient market hypothesis. And inefficiency is when essentially information is failed to be baked into price. That's from inefficient market hypothesis the theoretical definition. I don't care about that. That doesn't really matter to me. I actually much prefer more of the practical definitions for something like inefficiencies versus mispricings. So inefficiency for my lens and this isn't just based on me. This is like from work of most volatility traders and stuff like that. Like you can read you and some clairs books and he'll talk about the difference between inefficiencies and mispricings. And inefficiencies are things that we know are there. We can see them. And it's there for a reason. So you and some clear has one of the best examples of this that you can think of. So",

This is you and this example. You can check this out from some of the podcasts that I did with him. But it's a great example. If you have a 20 bill and you're walking down the side of the sidewalk and you see the 20 bill outside of a bar and it's like 11 o'clock at night. That is a mispricing relative to the market. There's probably a reason why that happened. There was probably a drunk dude coming out of the bar, fumbling to grab his shit. He dropped the 20 bill. You pick it up and then you walk on. Then if you walk past that bar every single day, is that 20 still going to be there each time? Probably not. That's a mispricing. Mispricings are things that pop up for some reason or another, but they're typically short-lived. Then there's inefficiencies. And efficiency is like the volatility risk premium.

And that 20 bill is out in the middle of the road, flopping around. You can go grab it. It's there. If you're fast enough, you can go grab it, get back to the sidewalk, take your 20, but there's a risk involved you could get hit by a fucking car. So we can see the 20 bill.

Maybe it would write the back or something, but you know, you get the point. There's a reason why it's there. So that's the exact difference between something like an inefficiency in a mispricing. An inefficiency is there for some sort of reason, and we know it's there. Post-earnings announcement drift is an example of an inefficiency. There are inefficiencies in momentum, triggers, information, indiscreteness is another inefficiency. There's lots of market inefficiencies, and they have varying levels of efficacy, tradable, window dressing is another known inefficiency. So inefficiencies are these things that we know are there that we can capitalize on them. We're typically not going to make a ton of money to grab them because they're going to be fairly competitive because a lot of people know they're there, but they continue to perpetuate. One of them says, Roryn Kitty tweets are inefficiency. That's a good question. I don't, I would call it a mispricing, but I also can absolutely see it being an inefficiency. The only reason why I would consider it a mispricing is because it gets priced away so fast, but to your point, it happens, well, not frequently, but semi-frequently. The way I view that is when Roryn Kitty tweets, that's when the drunk guy walks out of the bar. So it's not perpetual, but it is",

I appreciate you giving me something to noodle on. That's a fun one. Cool. Off-Poon says, or biotech stocks, that skyrocket between because phase one results are mildly positive. That's, I wouldn't call that inefficiency. The reason why I wouldn't call that inefficiency is because there's a clear compensatory risk. If you get those phase one results and they're not good or they're not well received for any reason, that same biotech stock is going to crater. Now, again, the inefficiency that applies to biotech is volatility risk premiums. Volatility risk premiums, because I trade them in biotech all the time. It's one of the best places to find them. They still generally in the aggregate will overcompensate for the periods that it doesn't work, but that's more an volatility perspective versus a price movement perspective.

If I sell that put and I sell this call, I now have two legs. This is not covered. This is a short strangle. So I can lose both sides.

It's automatically pulling in a share equivalent, right? Which is what we talked about in the example earlier for what would define a covered call. Right? So we'd have a short call long shares. So yep, that makes sense. But I would just say it's definitely not defined as more than one leg. That's incorrect. I can have multiple legs, right?

Yeah, I wouldn't consider it inefficiency because there's beta risk with it. Sector rotation strategies don't always win, right? So the way to capitalize that would be more of a momentum style thing as compared to sector rotations, I think. So the next question is, how is implied volatility calculated?

The second part of your answer is completely fine. So where we have an implied move from the current or the implied volatility from the current price. Now it's the reason why I say it's not really the last unknown from BSM. It's kind of what we solve for. I get your point there. I'm just clarifying a small component to it. So when we're calculating implied volatility, literally all we're doing is taking the current markets pricing of options. And we're breaking down the price into its different components. And we can use something like the Black Sholes Merton model to isolate the different variables because it's a differential equation. We can grab the pieces that we need. So when we're talking about implied volatility, we're just using option prices from the market. That's all. And we're backing out. You can use Black Sholes Merton completely fine. You can find it in other ways as well. But I think Black Sholes Merton is probably the most well known. So then the next question here is what is forecast volatility?

Those are both implied or forward looking. So I wouldn't say that personally. Any other guesses? Analyzed, autoregressive, heteroscedastic conditional. Nope, it's not a garsh model. G36 says expected move based on historic volatility could be. Apollo is the closest prediction. So that's the difference. So when we're looking at volatility, there are different kinds. And one of the kinds of volatility that's really important for us to understand is forecast. Now how we get to the forecast, we can use things like garsh models. We can use EJ garsh. We can use jump diffusion models. We can use anything. We can flip a coin and forecast volatility. The cliff notes though, is that forecasting volatility is literally the act of determining for yourself what implied volatility should be for an option. Retail traders normally don't do this. I do this more out of a scholastic sense. You can essentially take the markets pricing as volatility as it's probably much better than yours. But there's a difference.

    "text": "this. I do this more out of a scholastic sense. You can essentially take the markets pricing as volatility as it's probably much better than yours. But there's a difference. When we're looking at implied volatility, we're just looking at prices and we're pulling down what the market is implying. forecast volatility is literally when we make our own estimate of what volatility should be based on some sort of set model and circumstances. So that's the primary difference here. Does that make sense? The difference between like implied volatility and forecast volatility? Does they mean different things? What's the next question we do? Joey says you can compare the current expiration to the vol smile. Well, that's actually kind of a great preamble. So we'll see if that's correct, Joey. The next question for you is describe the volatility term structure, smile and surface. And in the meantime, we can talk about why volatility is important. So when we think about the importance of volatility, it's that it is the only unknown component that we piece together for an options price. Everything else that feeds into an options price is known. We know the underlying price. We know the strike price. We know if it's a caller input. We know what the risk free rate is. We know if there's a dividend. We know the days to expiration. I don't know if I said that one already or not, but all of the inputs that go into an option",

I don't know if I said that one already or not, but all of the inputs that go into an option price, we know all of them except for one, which is volatility. So most retail traders will use the implied volatility based on the market consensus. We can forecast our own, but then we have different views that we can take on volatility, which is exactly the question I have here. So the difference between a volatility term structure, smile and surface, they look at slightly different things. So Paul says surface, Joey looks like it has the most comprehensive of C. So volatility term structure is IV for an expiration. Smile would be IV for all in a certain expiration. Surface would be extra dimension. Okay, close. TradeJ says term is across expiration. Smile is volacross strikes. Surface is combo close. I like where we're at with these. Many other guesses. So if we take a look at vol and we take a look at this, nope. That's fine. Trying to find one that looks somewhat normal. All these are kind of janky. That's kind of normal. That was the most normal one I found. This one. Okay. So what am I looking at here?

Rees welcome in. So what is this? Joey says smile. TradeJ says smile. G36 says smile is correct. So when we're talking about a volatility smile, we're going to isolate within an expiration. And we're going to look at the volatility across strikes. That's all. Now if I take a look at, I'm going to try to find something that looks somewhat normal here. If I take a look at these two points, what is this? So we already know what smile is. We have two left. We have a surface in term structure. Term structure. Correct. An easy way to think about term structure is if we look at a futures contract. This is probably one of the simplest ways. This is term structure. So this is using spot futures prices. But you can do this with volatility. So this is showing you actually a kink in the term structure. This is tradable for the e-many futures. But the same exact thing applies when we look at options.

Looking at just these two is looking at term structure. So we're just looking at volatility at a set point across different time frames. So this here, if you plotted the implied volatilities for all of these, this is term structure. You can literally visualize this. So if you have a y-axis and an x-axis, and on the y-axis, we put a dot here to represent 18. So there's your first dot. Then we have another dot down here at 9. Then we have another dot up over here at 16. Then it goes up to 19. I'm drawing you, if you can follow along with the cursor, that is a term structure.

I can look across strike prices. I can look across expressions. That's what volatility surfaces. Now the purpose of turning it into a 3D model is because it's a little easier to consume if you're not used to looking at things. It's a little higher fidelity. It's easier to find things that really stick out. But for example, there's a lot of interesting anomalies even in with this, with respect to a volatility surface. So if we get rid of some of these, let's do this one, do this one, get rid of that one. Let's do that one. So in example, these two inverting here is strange. You normally don't see that. There's normally a reason why that happens. And it can be for a bunch of different reasons, but stuff like that is tradable. So even though this isn't a surface, you can still very easily spot anomalies. Once you kind of have a sense of what you're looking for. Joey says, how do you feel about this being a line versus plot since we only have discrete values at strikes? How do I feel about it in terms of what?

Part of the issue that you will find because these are lines is it can be a little confusing, like when you see kinks like these, but again, like the kinks are going to be relative to anchor points. Right? So I can tell you that this is the 81 strike relative to the 80 to the 82. Right? It's pretty visual in that way. So yeah, for me, I don't think there's anything at all wrong with it being a line. I actually think it makes it kind of easy to see things. Because if you look at a volatility surface, it's actually kind of difficult sometimes because it can be very, very noisy. Joey says, I see there are strikes between those. Yeah, absolutely. That's what causes the kinks. So in this case, I can tell you that the 81s are priced more expensively than the 80s and the 82s. Whether it should or shouldn't be, that's another scenario. But I can tell you that it's not following the shape of the price that you see for everything else. So it draws my eye. All right. This one should be fun.

But I think they're very, very misunderstood. So that's why I'm asking this. Facilitating trades is good. Setting the price sort of, not quite. And we'll explain why it's not quite.

Off-poon says liquidity. These are correct. The primary function. The primary function is to provide liquidity. It's actually not to provide prices. They inherently provide prices because if they price poorly, they'll get destroyed. But if I'm saying their primary job is providing liquidity and not necessarily providing prices, how does that work? Why would that be the case? Why would I differentiate between their job of providing liquidity versus providing prices? What provides prices in the stock market? Bires and sellers. G36 is on it. Not just buyers.

So, Paul Owen Swayte are talking about the function of buyers and sellers. Supply and demand. It's a consensus driven stock market. So, that's how pricing is done. So, say for example, let's use this. And let's say right now on these puts, their bid 136 offered at 140. Let's just say for whatever reason, let's just say that the market maker is currently pricing these at 145 and 130. Are they setting the price in this example? If they had these at 130 and these at 145, would they be setting the price here? With the idea that these prices are still here, by the way. Any guesses? They would not be setting the price. They would be outside the market. So, whoever is currently resting a bid here at 136, whether that's a market maker or another retail trader, or whoever's on this side doing the same thing at 140.

So that's why the transaction rates and the conversion rates at places like that are straight up abysmal, excuse me no competition. Now what happens when you walk out of the airport and there's three banks on the corner? All of a sudden, all of a sudden things are way more competitive.

It's they can make good money, but it is not super fun because they are completely relegated to order flow. So market makers provide liquidity. They are forced, if they're doing a job well, to set decent prices. But there's no imperative otherwise other than the natural supply and demand functions of the market. That's why when you look at less liquid stocks that aren't traded as much, the bid S spreads are super wide because nobody's in there. As competition and as liquidity is floods in, it forces more competitive pricing. Age says so if the market makers provide extra liquidity at a given price point, doesn't that affect the ability for people to transact beyond the bid S spread until the market maker runs out and determines the stopgiven liquidity exactly correct?

    "text": "take 138 of those. But for me selling, I only want to let 35 go at that 74. And that can be because of what the rest of their book looks like. It could be for a million different reasons, but that's exactly what that is. They get to set not just whatever price they think is spare based on volatility, but they also get to set what size they can sustain. And it's because again, market makers are relegated to order flow. So one of the things to think about is market makers. Their ideal scenario is to be able to buy from somebody and sell to somebody essentially at the same time, right? That would be absolutely great. If I could buy at 71 sell at 74, I would do that all day. But the problem is is market moves, markets move. So if I buy at 71 and then all of a sudden things start to plummet for whatever reason, well, I just bought at 71, but now they're worth 65. I don't want to unwind there because now I've just locked in a loss on that position. So they have to manage their inventory very carefully. That's really the most difficult part of being a market maker is an effective methodology for managing inventory. Joey says, I wonder if there's some inefficiency between spread and liquidity, such as typical spread amount usually equates to certain liquidity, maybe if they decrease the spread for the same volume.",

Inefficiency between spread and liquidity. I don't follow. I think you'd have to explain the thought a little bit more. Such as typical spread amount usually equates to certain liquidity. Do you mean in terms of the size they offer? It's not based on the spread amount typically. Again, that's going to be a much larger function of what their book looks like at a given point in time. And it also matters if there's other people inside the market. Again, like this is a great example. It's not just market makers that make markets. If there's probably a retail trader that is resting a 36 bid and they just want one of these 105s. That could be a retail trader that's inside the market maker. So in this case, you'll notice that these are three cents wide, these are only two cents wide. So if this is a market maker on the other side of this, the market maker could be bidding or offering at 52. And they might prefer to be at 48 or 49 down here. But there could be another market participant that's like, no, I'm good for 50 here. So that's, again, that's making markets",

If you operate inside their bid ask spread and rest in order, you're providing liquidity. So there's two sides of an options trade and there's liquidity consumption and liquidity provision. As a retail trader, we typically consume liquidity. That's when we come in and we want to sell one of these puts, we decide to, we're okay taking it at the bid and we lift the bid. In that case, you just took somebody's trade, right? That was offering their trade. You took it and removed that from the book that now somebody else can't get at. So you consume liquidity. But if I'm a trader that's currently resting in offer for these 95 puts for 21 cents and I have my order out there resting for somebody else to come take, I'm providing liquidity. It's a difference. Lot of me says I was filled on five contracts today below the bid, the last price changed, but not the bid ask. Yeah, that can happen in an instant.

And the marketing makers will do that so that they're not always showing everybody what they're pricing that volns that. And the reason why I know it was the cases because I came inside their offers and I still wasn't filled. So it tells me that there was a mispricing there. There were resting things at a mispricing. That's what led me to them because they looked attractive. But then I didn't get a fill because there were a mispricing. Nobody wanted to transact at that point. And at that, I rested. My order's there for a little bit to see if anybody would come scoop them and nobody did. So that's an example where, I mean, at that point, I was attempting to provide liquidity.

The reason why I don't say delta, again, it's I understand what you guys mean when you say delta. But when we're in this kind of setting, I try to be as accurate as possible. And delta is not fully accurate because delta tells us the rate of change of an options premium. If you use something like beta, I could go along with it. Now in this context, though, it's just the price of the underlying, the directional movement. And I know again, that's what you mean by delta.

But again, in a non-clogical setting, it delta means something else. So movement of the underlying would be the primary input. Thomas says, could you please say, if you trade zero DTEs and how? I do. I have a playlist you can check out. I'm not going to go into that here because that's not the purpose of this live stream. But I'm happy to direct you to this entire playlist that I have on zero DTE option. So Thomas, that one is real. But yes, I trade zero DTEs essentially every single day, big part of what I do. A small amount of the portfolio that goes into it, but a big part of the frequency. Cool. All right, let's take a look at a couple more. And then we'll see if there's any specific questions that you guys want to get into. This one. Describe the disposition effect. Why do you care about it? Because believe it or not, you do care. Whether you know you care or not is another, that's another question. But you do care. And I want to know why you care. Describe the disposition effect.

Yeah, okay, that's why I'm asking the question because it's an important one to know. Reese says overconfidence. It's not overconfidence. That's a little bit different. But holding onto losing trades is correct. Paulo also has spot on the tendency to cash in, to take profitable trades down too quickly. And to let losing trades run. So it is a massive psychological function of traders that's very, very well documented and studied. And again, this is where a lot of the stuff I try to share with you guys comes from. So if you come in here and you go to this my website and if you go to trader decision making cognitive biases, this goes through essentially what we're all riddled with. And this is one of them. So and there's a reason why this is number one at the top. And it's because it's something that we all innately want to do. But we don't always have a solid mechanism in place to limit the impact. So it's the tendency to cut winners too short and let losing trades run. So why does this happen? Why do we do this? Well, walk me through what would",

Because there's a very clear thought pattern that goes into that and why it happens. It's observable. Reese says lock in a win. Joey says I don't want to be greedy. That's a big one feels good to take profit. That's exactly it. Lost on another trade and massive. Feels bad to lose money. Fear of returning into a loser.

Ten different comments over the course of a few seconds of all these different emotions that we have that lead to us doing this. Literally, that's exactly correct. It's the fact that there's this cocktail of reasons why taking winning trades down is so alluring. The other thing to think about is how many times have you heard nobody's ever gone broke taking profits? It sounds smart, doesn't it? It sounds real, real smart.

If you're in the process of taking profits, I guarantee you you're in the process of booking losses as well. You just might not want to look at them. So we need to strike a balance here. And this is why I emphasize so heavily the concept of expected returns because I show examples all the time on how you can have systems with these massive high win rates that still don't matter. That still lose money in the aggregate. So this video here is about probability of profit and expected returns and why expected returns are so important. This one is about managing options, positions, and expected returns. So the process of managing expected returns is literally essential. So what I would offer to everybody is that when you're trading, stop worrying about the outcome of every one single trade and start thinking way more about the outcome of a process. Because that's where expected return lies, not in the outcome of an individual trade. When we are too concerned about the outcome of an individual trade, this is exactly why we walk into the disposition effect. Roing Titty says, are there stock therapists? That's hilarious. There's",

And the reason why we spend a lot of time going through this stuff is it sounds weird. But like the process of making money trading is, it's literally easy. Once you understand how it works, the thing that most of us spend most of our time fighting against literally is ourselves. Stocks go up, stocks go down. Volatility goes up. Everybody goes down. It's not difficult to measure the probability of those things happening. It's literally not difficult. What's difficult though is making sure that we're measuring things objectively. What's difficult though is that we're not just focusing on the outcomes when we're analyzing stuff that we like and we're looking at the overall breadth of data. This not difficult is weighing other reference points from other exercises or ideas that don't actually matter in this circumstance. So literally the process of making money is, is what it is.

How do I even go about getting over all of this shit? And for me, the first part is becoming aware of its existence. This is exactly why when you guys hear me talk about trading and markets, I talk about them in the way that I do.

That is the pitch on cognitive biases. Let's take a look at a couple other things. And then for those that otherwise, if you have any questions or any specific topics, theories, anything like that that you want to take a look at now is the correct time to start throwing those in before we wrap up. Here's the next question. Explain what Bayesian statistical model is or what Bayesian statistics are. And the reason I'm asking you this is because if you're a trader, I think this is probably the only way to think. That's a little lopsided, but that's what I personally think, but I can understand how people might not. Vladimir says over time, did you move to trade a higher percentage of indices and ETFs than single stocks, not a higher percentage, but definitely a higher weighting of the portfolio. And that's just because it becomes easier as the portfolio grows to scale, it becomes really difficult to find enough things to put individual trades on in like it's doable, but it's really, really arduous. And then you still have to fight with liquidity on a lot of them. It's funny because when you look at options, there's a lot of things that offer options, but the number of things that offer liquid",

It's funny because when you look at options, there's a lot of things that offer options, but the number of things that offer liquid options, there's less than a thousand of them. And even that is like really generous. So your world gets collapsed down really fast as your account grows. So one of the issues that you'll find is finding things that you might have an idea on, but it becomes untradable because you can't really put on a position that makes sense even for what you want. So there's nothing at all wrong with trading individual equities or securities. It's completely okay. But I think it has to be really centered around what makes sense for the trader in their book. Because even right now, I don't have a ton of trades on. I took a bunch down this week. I have less than a hundred trades on right now. But the overwhelming majority of my exposure is in indices. It's in futures. And then the residual, I have tons of individual trades on an individual product, but they're much, much smaller.

I'm going to exhaust the resources available to me at a given point in time to understand something. Whether that's creating a strategy, whether that's modeling a trade, whatever it is. The idea behind Bayesian statistics is once there's new information, you update your prior conclusions. And this is a giant trap for a lot of traders because as a person, your taught or socially influenced that if you change your opinion, then you're wrong. You're proving that you're wrong and that's bad. People will look at you and be like, oh, they were wrong about that. Ha, ha, ha. And meanwhile, it's like it's literally the dumbest thing I can think of because one of them, like the highest forms of intellect is to be able to have a really well formed idea and then pivot as soon as there's something that contradicts the idea. The problem is that our ideas and bias becomes part of our identity. It becomes part of who you are. And if you allow that attachment to happen, it's a fucking disease.

I feel like I'm selling contracts a week early. You will you're exhibiting a bunch of different biases, believe it or not. So when you're thinking about what you're doing is you're honing in on very specific data points for whatever reason. So you're using this, you're using this and essentially what's happening in this. These are like the, I don't know, the three I would highlight that you're committing most readily when I see that. Wigglywarm is essentially you have a grossly incomplete data sample that you're drawing broad conclusions from. And you're using my guess is if you have a trade log, I would guess again, this isn't to like throw shade, but my guess is you don't have a trade log that we could look through and actually quantify the number of times that that happens. And my guess is if we did, the sample would be very small. What we would call completely insignificant. And again, that's not like throwing shade. It's just a statistical term. If a sample doesn't have enough occurrences, we would call it statistically insignificant. So I think in your scenario, you probably need to paper trade more. Again,",

If a sample doesn't have enough occurrences, we would call it statistically insignificant. So I think in your scenario, you probably need to paper trade more. Again, nobody, I have a video hopefully coming out tomorrow. I'm waiting to see if my editor can wrap it up super quick. But I don't know if it'll be done. Wigglywarm says I've been thinking I need something, but I guess I don't even know what to log. It's really cool because I have a video about this exact thing. Here you go. So that video there, it's a little bit old, it's from last year, but it talks about essentially creating trading plans, trading logs and literally how to create your own trading documentation so that we can track things more effectively as what it boils down to. But yeah, I think that's all that's happening with you. Roryntitty says you should become a professor at UCSD. I think I would hate that. Absolutely hate that. It's a hilarious idea. I do love teaching, but I would hate that. I think like collegiate, I don't really, I don't know, man, like I did undergrad and grad.

That's probably the most useful thing that I learned in college is statistics. Lord Slothable says, learn Greeks. I have a playlist for you, my friend. That is options 101. So in this options 101 playlist, I think you should watch the options video, the intro to options video. And then I think you should look at there's a video on there specifically on the Greeks.

It really for like most, if I didn't know somebody from a hole in the wall, I would tell them to trade spy too.

We can tackle those, look through any of that stuff. And then otherwise we'll get ready to wrap up in a few minutes. Vladimir says retail stock trading has been around a lot longer than the internet. My grandfather traded and just checked in nightly news, newspaper. Yeah, that's so cool. I literally think that that's like such an OG way to trade. It's like, yeah, I love that so much. I think it's so sick. Reese says who you got in the UFC tomorrow. That's a great question. I think I do think Sean O'Malley will, man, I know he, well, again, probabilistic, right? I know Sean O'Malley is the favorite over Marab, but I like Marab a lot. I think that he's a really good fighter. He's on like a 10 fight win streak. So I'm legitimately very curious how Marab will do because Sean is elusive, but if Marab can like grapple with him, I think that would be very difficult.

I have a maximum of negative 500 deltas from these. So then that would give me uncapped 300 deltas. But it's all about the ratio. Because if you sold eight, well now you have a problem. Now you have capped upside because you're at a one to one ratio between total max long deltas versus short deltas. So it's entirely dependent on the delta ratio that you're maintaining with the trade. I get open the door for the pup. So yeah.

That's no problem at all, because that also completely takes away anybody's, you know, gumption to copy what I'm doing if we know we're back in 2012, right? There's literally no reason to copy anything I'm doing today based on that. So yeah, absolutely. Paper trading, entirely possible. Happy to do that for sure. And I've done that before because I think it's kind of fun. So yeah, that's a absolutely chill recommendation. Paul says, how many active trades do you have at a time? I would say on average, somewhere between five and 20, on average, like the overall bulk of my trading career, I think it's very common for me to land. Between like 20 and 100. And I would say like the majority, yeah, the majority is probably like 25 to 50. I say average because when the market is just kind of right, if I look across my trading career, there's pro long periods of time, because I started trading in 2007. There's pro long periods of time where the market was just upsloping to the right. So it's about as easy as it gets leveraged long products. You don't need that many of them. So in those instances, like if I think about the average holding across a trading career, it gets skewed by that. If I look over from like 2020 to present, it's probably closer to",

And if I'm putting on more trades, the vast majority of those are actually going to be variance risk premiums, volatility risk premiums plays, like just kind of turning things out. Most of my like capital is committed to a much smaller set of trades, less than 10 for sure. Absolutely less than 10. There will be periods where it's two, there will be periods where it may be five or six, but most of the capital is typically tried up in just a handful of core positions.

Yeah, I mean, whenever we do something in hindsight, it always looks so beautiful, doesn't it? But the problem is, again, if we take a look at the actual performance of it, it has a lot of problems. So if we do something like clear this, we go TQs, we just go 100. And we want to go back, I'll go back as far as this lets me, the 2015. So anything you're doing, oh, you mean through 22? Yeah, so if you look at the performance of this from inception and you can go back further, but to go back further, you just have to create a surrogate, which is completely fine. That's what a lot of people do to try to test this over a longer term timeframe. But yeah, like it's completely doable.

There's some variations of this that you'll look at in an 0809 drawdown that go illiquid, that literally blow up. So the question then you have to ask yourself is, if you have 10,000 and you watch that decline by 80, like who cares, right? It's 10 grand. But if you have your life wealth, let's say it's 5 million and you watch that contract by 80. I don't think you're sitting in it. I don't think anybody's fucking sitting in that. I'm not sitting in that. There's no way. And it's because you are faced with now in uncertainty going forward, right? When we back test, it's so easy to find things that perform. I can show you back test that perform even better than this. That look great. But the problem is, is that when we're looking forward into the future, is AI going to become regulated?

Because I know the outcome. I know it's still pretty solid, but it's not quite as clear as that because if we take a look at something like T triple cues, once you get into three times leverage, you're outside of the Goldilocks zone. And I don't mean it in terms of Goldilocks analysis. I mean, in terms of performance, it still has not gotten back to all time highs. It still has not. If I look at something like spy, it has and it's posting new highs. If I look at a two times leveraged ETF, which is a better long term buy and hold leveraged ETF, it did hit new highs fell down.

But it absolutely beat these previous highs. If I look at something like T triple cues, that is not what happened. It's the closest it got was within six points or so, but not quite. It still hasn't got back to break even from its all time high. So volatility drag is a thing. And this spreadsheet you have is totally cool. Again, I'm not trouncing on leverage ETFs. I use them. I use them in my retirement accounts for things that I trade less frequently, but I don't use three times leveraged because I know I can look at historic market data. And I can find that the optimal leverage is typically around like 2.3. Now you can create a surrogate 2.3 leverage with something like T triple cues by offsetting it with another product and just scaling the positions. But it doesn't change the behavior of the product itself, which is a daily leveraged product. So yeah, I don't hate them at all, but I just think it's so important to understand what they are, how they behave, how they fit into things and how we think we might actually behave.

If that takes you from, again, your 5 million, that takes you down to two and a half, clearly, right? That's just the math. But if you think of that from like a functional standpoint, a livelihood standpoint, that is a massive material change in your resources. The difference between a 2.5 million net worth and a 5 million net worth is significant, absolutely significant. So if you're planning on retiring, you have your 5 million, you have a conservative lifestyle so you don't need a bunch of money, you can live off of it, you can stand inflation, you can stand when costs pop up once in a while, you can do all that with your 5 million account if you choose to retire early. At a 2.5 million account? Probably not. Probably not. You're going to run out of money more likely than not. Unless you're super conservative and stuff like that, it doesn't give you the same playing field.

What, where is that saying from? What does that even mean? Hold on one second, I have to look that up. I like to look up things like that. What is the origin of rose colored glasses? Let's see. Rose. Rose colored glasses or rose tinted glasses refers to the tenancy and overly optimistic early literary use. The phrase appeared in literary works during the 19th century. One of the earliest uses of the phrase is attributed to Thomas Corlyle, a Scottish philosopher and essayist who referred to people seeing the word through rose colored spectacles in his work. Love that. Suggest the metaphor was used in like the 30s and 40s. I got to be honest, that's actually like super, super cool. Did not know that. Vladimir says I'm not suggesting go all in, but so many are skeptical about T-Triple Q. Well, I think people are skeptical about leveraged funds because they misunderstand what leverage is and what things like volatility to K are. A lot of people believe when you're holding something like a volatility or a leveraged asset, that is just like falling apart in",

A lot of people believe when you're holding something like a volatility or a leveraged asset, that is just like falling apart in your hands on a daily basis. That's not the case at all. There's cost. Again, one of the frictions in something like T-Triple Q's is not small. It's like a 4 year penalty on your return. That's just general cost from the rebalancing. It's not like an insignificant hurdle to get over, but that's not the end of the world. If you're trading something, that's going up massively. This doesn't include volatility to K, which will chew you up to the downside. That's why when you're trading something like leveraged ETFs, it's so important to use some sort of system. Because again, if you go through a bad path, you can get absolutely mangled. If you look at this move here, this is no joke. This went from 85 down to 48. It did that in a month. That's a really nasty move. If you think about leveraged ETFs, again, they look really good because as of lately, they've performed really well. But they don't always do that.

If I look at my compound annual growth rate, which right now is 26. If we look at the compound annual growth rate for Teachable Q's over its lifespan, which is a shorter duration than mine to be clear. But let's take a quick look. Because I think it's what, like low 30s. But then if you look at its standard deviation, it's like over 50. Which is essentially like the inverse of what mine is. Let me see. Clear these. I had Teachable Q's back. 100. Look. 34 compound annual growth rate. Yeah. So it absolutely beats me. It beats me by 8. Ish, a little under 8. But this is nuts.

    "text": "week. It really depends on if my editor finishes the paper trading video for tomorrow. If he does, paper trading will come out tomorrow. And then how I analyze the stock market will be the following week. But yeah, I use a ton of stuff. I use breath indicators. I use indices or relationships between the indices, volume, relative strength. I'll use economic cycles. I kind of take like a very top down approach. It helps me contextualize things pretty well. It's a good question though. All right, gang. That about wraps me up. Super fun. Love hanging out with you guys tomorrow is the GME live stream. We're going to go through the rest of roaring kiddie's trades and then talk about the new offerings and hopefully dive further and further into things. But as always, if there's anything you want me to take a look at, let me know. Be an outlier. I'll see you guys around. Take care.",
