And some the person on the phone on the earnings, I was like, well, that's great. That's awesome. That's fantastic. How much money did you guys make? Well, I'm not really sure. I think we did pretty well on the phones. The headphones also sold really well. But yeah, we made a lot of money. Oh, interesting. So of those different things that you sold, which one sold better, I really don't know that it doesn't matter. We made money, right? You get the point. If the company tried to do an earnings release, what traders tried to do every day with respect to their trading approach, nobody would invest in those companies. Nobody would invest in Apple if that's how their earnings release went because you can't trust the company. So then taking that back to trading, tracking is essential. Most people don't do it because they're under the guise that this thing is going to be easier than it is. So why do that extra step if you think you can get",

Most people don't do it because they're under the guise that this thing is going to be easier than it is. So why do that extra step if you think you can get by without doing it and still get the outcome you want? So it's that dissonance that leads to it. The reason why this is important to you is because throughout your entire trading career, your brain is going to try and find the easy offshoots. What's the Pareto principle we can apply here where essentially we get 80 of the results from 20 of the inputs. The answer to that is through investing. That's the Pareto principle with respect to markets. With respect to trading, you give up the Pareto principle. You now are in the game of actually making money consistently through markets. There isn't a Pareto principle for that. That's investing. Next question. How can we create an aligned approach to trading starting from long-term goals? And there are a few things that really blend in with this. So what's your answer to that? Like let's say somebody came up to you and they said, I want to start trading. What do you say to them? Because for most people, they would start giving advice things like, oh, you should try looking at vertical spreads or you should try this other thing. And most of those people are",

The reality is we have to start with some kind of goal. So how do we do that? How do we create a goal and then set up an aligned process so that what we're doing aligns with that ultimate goal? And there's some very specific steps we can take to do so. What are they? Dejean says trading plan. That's definitely one of them. And you're actually starting also to answer the second question here so we can kind of dual-hat do both of these at once. I think that that's fair. About time to get this drawn pad out.

The reason why doing this is so important is because if we have these numbers, we can now reverse engineer what needs to happen year over year on average in order to get from our starting point down here to our desired endpoint up here. This is different than what most people do. What most people do is they don't set goals. They start trading and think of the difference in an approach. For example, I know in order to make my 25 return on the year, which is a fair target for a season trader for sure, you're targeting your 25 on the year. You can break that down into smaller increments and then you can size the portfolio based on what opportunities exist in the market at that point in time to make sure you're continually moving towards that goal. What you don't have to do is randomly put on trades randomly take trades down and then kind of hope it comes out in the wash in the military. We have another saying we use all the time.

That means if you're aiming at a target and your goal is just to hit the paper of the target, you're probably going to be super inconsistent because you're not actually trying to hit a very pinpoint frame. You're trying to just hit the paper. So then you have to paper here, here, here, and that's good in trading that equals variance in your returns. You can control that by aiming smaller dial in that target. So the way we create an aligned approach to trading is we start by defining our goals. Then we break these goals down in reverse engineer fashion into smaller, mile stone targets. If I need X number of dollars in Y amount of time and my starting point is Z dollars and T time, I now have literally a formula that I know I need to execute to get from here to there.

This isn't some move my head real quick. Say you see, check out that sloppy rating. This doesn't really mean anything. But really what this is is your goals. I refer to it as millionaire roadmap to try and remind people to think bigger because a lot of people start from the perspective of a constrained thought I did in the beginning.

If there's not something for us to base our decision making off of, it's just guessing. That's not going to work in trading. You can be lucky in trading. You can be lucky for a long time. Not going to be lucky over an entire trading career. If you are in markets for 30, 40, 50 years, your results are going to be the results of your process and your actual skill set. There's no luck that's going to span that entire time frame. Not how it works. You can have short run luck. You could be lucky for three, four years. That is a thing. You can be lucky even for those longer durations. It's going to run out. Okay, great. So that's our recap quiz. Now let's take a quick peek at just the actual recap notes for you. So you can see these are the things that we talked about last time. We talked about the millionaire road mapping process. This is the begin with the end in mind from the seven habits of highly successful people that's from Stephen Covey's book. We talked about how to create a trading plan outline with the key sections that belong in there to give you a place to start. A lot of people say shit like, oh, trade your plan.

We talked about how to create a trading plan outline with the key sections that belong in there to give you a place to start. A lot of people say shit like, oh, trade your plan. But then nobody actually really takes the time to go into detail on how to make a plan. It's easy to say, trade your plan. Never deviate from your plan. But the real question, of course, if somebody's given a plan that has natural positive expectancy, of course, it would be easy to follow it. Guess what? All of the work is done in making the damn plan. So that's what we reviewed on the last session. And then also we talked about what kind of metrics makes sense to track in your log relative to your plan. All of these things align with one another to give you a better idea of what you're trying to do as a trader. Cool. Recap is on onto the agenda for today. And now is where we get into the fun stuff. I got to update our little timestamp. This will be volatility overview. So here are your TLOs, terminal learning objectives again, military term.

And that means at the end of the session, there will be an answer to every single one that we input here. So I saw one earlier from Lauren. Lauren says an old podcast was since Claire, you both spoke about new traders and the stock doing exactly what they thought, but they didn't make money. I'm glad I'm not special, but can you talk more about why? Absolutely. This is actually great. This is the concept I refer to as right, but wrong. So definitely what other stuff do you want to add to this? Anything else? Any other questions? And then I'll leave that we can continue updating it as we go along. So don't worry if there's nothing that's like popping out at you right now. We'll be able to maintain it. But at a bare minimum, this is what you will be able to walk away with.

So let's get into the big, ugly, massive slide of doom. Now really the slide of doom, hopefully is not a slide of doom. The reason why I'm showing you this in a slide format is so you can take fucking screenshots so that you have your own notes. That's why I'm doing this. So there are a lot of different elements of volatility that are super important to us. We're going to start literally from the top and work through quite literally all of it. So the first thing is what volatility is. Volatility is just a term. And volatility itself is a measurement. It's exactly what you see at the top of the screen here. It's the time bound measurement of variance. And we'll get into what variance is in a little bit. The easy way to think about something like volatility is simply how much we expect something to move. Now, there are other ways you can label volatility. Volatility is the way we talk about dispersion from the mean in financial markets. We refer to it as volatility.

We have implied we have historical, which is also known as statistical volatility. And then there's realized volatility. So the one you're most familiar with in the concept of trading options is actually this one implied volatility. This implied volatility is the annualized expected one standard deviation move. And for those that remember the standard bell curve, about 68 of data is going to fall within one standard deviation. 95 of data falls within two. 99.7 falls within three. So this is the majority of data will fall within this move. That doesn't mean that the move is restricted to this level. It simply means that this is what is expected within a one standard deviation probability. And to give you an example of what this looks like, if I pull up Walmart, could all fashion Walmart out here crushing it, take a look at the implied volatility 32.29.

This note is really important because you'll notice that if we take a look at historical volatility, it uses trading days. You have to be aware of small details like that. So if I'm trying to compare something like 30 day volatility with 30 day realize volatility, you actually have to use 30 and 20. Otherwise, you're not comparing the same thing. So admin note, one using calendar days, which is IV HV historic volatility uses trading days. So let's talk about HV next. I know we skipped forecast. We'll get back to it. Historical volatility is the actual movement of something. So the way to think about implied volatility is really, really simple. If we have time zero, a key, this is the present. Welcome to the present. Press, good old press. Then we have forward looking future. This is IV. Then we have backwards looking. This is HV. This is the past. So IV is always forward looking.

These are the primary volatility you care about from a retail trading perspective. Now, I'm going to review the other ones because I already told you and you could tell probably from the discord on some of the things I was posting is I'm excited to talk about this because nobody likes talking about this stuff. I can't like talk to my wife about something like this because she doesn't really care about volatility and Thor is dead asleep right now and is heated blanket. So I am a geek about options trading and this stuff. So it's very cool to actually be able to talk about this and hopefully teach some people about some of these concepts. So implied volatility forward looking historical volatility backwards looking always. Up, realize volatility realize volatility. You don't really need to worry about too much, but realize volatility can be backwards looking or forwards looking on a weird. So backwards looking is akin to historic volatility. Now you can calculate the difference between HV and realize volatility from a backwards looking perspective. There's a difference in calculation. RV from a backwards looking perspective typically is going to use shorter term timeframes and then it's going to sum them up. It will use the log returns statistical volatility tends to look at ranges total ranges. So they will yield slightly different",

This is superfluous information for most people on the stream right now. This is just for your information. Now forwards looking volatility is where you get your healthy dose of a mind fuck and future realized volatility. FRV is a forward looking metric. The fun part about FRV is it can't be known, but it can be used to model decisions based on current state expected forecast and future volatility. Not going to dive super deep into that because it's not relevant to most of you, but you should know these terms. The main terms for you to understand IV HV. You can understand that RV and HV are very similar, but there's a difference in the calculation modality yielding slightly different results.

Forecast volatility is the work of determining what's input into the pricing model. This is something that most retail traders are not going to touch. Now I will show you some tools that you can touch it if you're interested in tinkering with it. But I can tell you from a broad sense, this is not going to derive you pretty much any edge and the viability of you being able to price better than the broad market consensus is very low. But it's still a fun exercise. And again, if you're going to take this stuff seriously and it's going to be a significant contributor to hopefully your future income and your wealth, it's worth knowing. It's stuff that I've all messed with. I'm actually going to show you in a little bit how to build your own volatility calculator using a bunch of different models. So it's relatively straightforward to do from those simplified volatility calculations, but it can get pretty heavy. Okay.

So if we take a look at the platform, as I've already told you, this is the annualized volatility. Now there are different periods of volatility we can look at.

This is essentially the equivalent of opening Christmas presents, I think, for an options trader at least. So we just talked about how implied volatility has various windows. We can see that we can look at it for different expiration cycles. We can literally calculate it relevant to any specific time frame. Now we need to talk about different ways we can visualize volatility. And there are a handful that will be pertinent to you. So volatility, we can look at it in terms of skew, we can look at it in terms of smiles, we can create a volatility surface. These are different modalities for us to visualize volatility. So first, let's tackle skew. If we take a look at an options chain, again, just sticking it with Walmart, because we're here. And let's take a look at the volatility. And the first thing we have to do is try to normalize. We have to try to find the closest like deltas that we can. So I see a 10 delta call here, and then I see an 11 delta put here.

So not exactly the same, but similar. And if we take a look at these, first, let's start with the call. The implied volatility for this call is 27.49. Every single option is going to have its own implied volatility. Now, to help you visualize what the smile is, if you take a look at this entire column of implied volatilities, and that's supposed to be oval of sorts, you can tell, just take a look at how all these different implied volatilities correspond to a strike price over here. So we can plot this in a 2D frame. We can have strike price down here. And then we can have vol over here. So then we can have 30, 35, and then I'm just going to skip a bunch, 70, 105, 130. And obviously the real way to plot this would be to do all of them, but you don't have to. At 130, we can see that the volatility here is 173. So let's pretend that's way up there. At 35, we can see it's at 155. So let's pretend it's somewhere around there. 70 is at 64. So that would be about half of that. That would be kind of down there. Then the 105 here is at 26.

So first, any questions on the time frames we reviewed and this concept of skew. Right now I'm showing you one type of skew. There's other we're going to look into, but I want to see if this so far makes sense. Good. This stuff will slightly expand on one another. So here we're looking at, oops, I don't know my drawing tool. Here we're looking at a smile. For skew, we want to take a look at the relative volatility between calls and puts.

If we take a look at the 11 delta, put, which is pretty close, this is marked at a 31 vol. So what this is showing you that right now on a relative basis, the puts are skewed. The puts are priced more expensive than the corresponding delta of out of the money calls to out of the money puts. This is normal. More often than not, you will see the volatility on the put side skewed. This exists because we tend to fear the downside more than we fear the upside and people are willing to essentially overpay to protect to the downside. So this is typically what you will see. This is not always the case. There are lots of anomalies all over the place. We'll look at some of them. But the concept of skew here is talking about the relative price for the same delta, same expiration cycle between calls and puts. Okay. Last visualization tool I want to show you is the surface. Now for those that don't know, typically when you get an implied volatility surface, it's 3D. And I'll show you, you can make them pretty easily. It's not difficult to make. Here they are.

Here they are. You can make them in Python. The whole idea of an implied volatility surface is it allows you to visualize all of the different strikes and you can tell it moves you into three dimensions. You don't actually have to visualize it in 3D to see the same information. This here is a volatility surface. It's just in 2D. So let's get rid of all of these different series. Let's trim it down the fewer series. We have three series now. This is a volatility surface. There are several data points here for you to take away. And the y-axis is the out of the money implied volatility. The x-axis is the strike price. The multiple lines are different expressions. So we have the same 3D inputs that a surface has. It's just a different way to visualize it. Now the whole point of a volatility surface is to be able to make comparisons between volatility across strikes, across expressions. And that's exactly what this is designed to do. So for example, we can take a look at the 21 March expiration cycle and we can see that this looks really different compared to what you're seeing on the 21 Feb and the 17 April. Do we know why? No, not upfront. We don't.",

Is there anything potentially going on during the expiration cycle of 21 March? Well, if we take a look at earnings that has earnings on the 20th, so you can see right now volatility is really, really high for this front expiration, the 21 Feb, on a relative basis. The other thing you can see is that there are certain strikes that are really elevated compared to others. So within this 21 March expiration, this 62 and a half strike is really elevated compared to right next to it at the 60 or right next to it the other direction at the 65. So there are different ways that we can use that information to come up with trade ideas. You can play the relative value between strikes. So an example of that is let's say I think that this 62 and a half is expensive and I think that this 65 is cheap.

I can sell the 62 and a half and I can buy the 65, make a vertical and I can play it from the perspective of trying to isolate the difference between these. Now for retail trading is very difficult to actually isolate volatility completely. You have to delta hedge, gamma hedge, and then even with doing that because of the carrying costs, it's essentially an imperfect game. And unfortunately we don't have access to variant swaps. Those are custom products that are built by banks at the request of different entities. But variant swaps are cool because they actually fully and truly isolate volatility, which is really, really solid. So now we understand the various visualization techniques for implied volatility. The next thing we have to talk about is the standard behavior of volatility. But before that, questions, anything that we talked about so far that you're unsure of or that you want to dive in to deeper. And then I'm obviously updating our notes so far. Dejan says puts in normally skew to protect portfolios from a black swan event. It's not necessarily that in and of itself just to be clear, but it is the fact that people are generally willing to hedge to the downside. That's completely accurate. Reese says prior question is this all based around one standard",

It's not necessarily that in and of itself just to be clear, but it is the fact that people are generally willing to hedge to the downside. That's completely accurate. Reese says prior question is this all based around one standard deviation. Which stuff are you talking about? Sorry, I think I got to that question a little bit late. Reese when you say is this all based around what standard deviation, what do we, what do you refer into there? And then I got to get my dinner order ready to launch. All right, it hurts something like IV is based on one standard deviation. Yeah, so annualized volatility. So when you see the implied volatility for a stock that is the annualized expected move within a one standard deviation framework. So that doesn't mean that that is essentially what's going to happen. It simply means that that's again within one standard deviation. That's the more probable scenario, but you can have bigger moves that fall outside of that pretty easily actually. So it is that's what implied volatility when you see it quoted for the stockets. Reese says so does looking at two standard deviations, everything is way different. It's about double. So if I wanted to know what the two standard deviation expected move is or Walmart relative to what this is saying, meaning 32.2. We can figure out what the expected price range is for that at",

So if I wanted to know what the two standard deviation expected move is or Walmart relative to what this is saying, meaning 32.2. We can figure out what the expected price range is for that at a one standard deviation. You multiply that price range by two. And then you have two standard deviation confidence interval. Good question. Sweet. Onward we go. So now we're at 44. We'll just call it 45 minute. We have to talk about some of the key behavior of volatility. The reason why this is so important is because volatility has some of the most predictable movement patterns that exists in markets. So we have to acknowledge that so that therefore we can try to take advantage of it. So volatility is mean reverting. It is a true mean reverting asset unlike price. A stock is not mean reverting. It can have mean reverting tendencies in the short term. But stocks typically exhibit drift, which is kind of the antithesis of mean reversion. Now to help you visualize this, let's take a look at an example. If I zoom this out to let's do five year weekly, what do you notice for Walmart? It's gone up, right? I can see that this is a standard deviation channel. And I can see that most price falls within the standard deviation channel, but not all of it. And if I take a look",

And if I take a look at the slope of the standard deviation channel, it's 70 up here and down here, it's 35 and a half. So about doubled for comparison, let's take a look at VIX. VIX instead, if we take a look at the difference between here, which is 29 and down here, which is 12. This is actually a really big change relative for VIX. We'll probably have to zoom this out a little bit more. And that's mostly because of what happened during COVID, that kind of anomalous experience. Let's move this out further. So moving it out to 10 years, you can see that the midline, the mean for VIX here is 1632 and then up here it's 2072. This is over 10 years. And if we use the same example for Walmart, take a look at the difference. Walmart starts down here at 15 and over that same time frame, it's now up at 67. Here's what's happening. Price exhibits drift. This is due to the expansionary properties of our economy and companies, the ability for them to continue making more and more money over time and scaling.

This is due to the expansionary properties of our economy and companies, the ability for them to continue making more and more money over time and scaling. Valtility is completely different. Valtility, anytime it goes up, it will come back down at some point. It will every single time. It's just a matter of when, how much and how far and those kinds of things. But Valtility is a true mean reverting asset class, unlike stocks, stocks exhibit drift. Another thing that you'll notice about volatility as compared to stocks, similar to stocks, but different than stocks is the propensity for clustering. What this means is volatility tends to hang around where it is until there's some sort of catalyst for change one way or the other up or down. And then when that change happens, that's a transition period. Then post transition period, volatility tends to cluster for some duration of time. And then it goes through another transition period before it continues the mean reversion process. So this is a great example of it. Now you can just visualize this and come up with some general ideas. This is a five year weekly chart. One of the things I can tell you is that it doesn't really look like when it's in these really elevated positions that it stays there for that long.

He does have dinner breath and he's prepared to continue talking to us now about the clustering properties of VIX. Is that right? You ready to talk about the VIX? He's ready to talk about them. He's not released. All right. So clustering, that's the propensity for what you see with respect to volatility to tend to be very similar to what it was prior. And then sooner or later, there will be a transition period and then post transition period. There will be another clustering component. This is something that can be traded and is often traded. There's one other behavior that we need to talk about, which is the correlation to price. So let's take a look at this. There's a really common misconception. Let me know if you've heard this.

Now we're analyzing two different things in confusing them. Okay. So Reese has heard that before. Reese, were you aware that that is a complete fallacy in a nutshell? There's truth to it, but it's a misconception. Did you know that that's a misconception? And to help with that, let's do this. Let's eyeball. So what I'm showing you, exactly. So Reese is on it. It's a general observation. It does happen pretty regularly. But it's not a causal relationship. Remember, the context of volatility is the expected deviation of something. So if we expect something to move a lot, that's not specific to whether price is going up or if price is going down, you can have price go up. And things still become more volatile. It happens even in SPX. There are clear periods in time where volatility has gone up and price goes up. There's also clear periods of time where volatility goes down and price goes down. That's less frequent, but it can happen. So the general observation is that as price goes down, people become more nervous. People are paying more now for options",

So the general observation is that as price goes down, people become more nervous. People are paying more now for options because of the downside risk. And that tends to increase overall volatility. But it's not a prescriptive rule. There are plenty of times that you will see volatility move independently or directly correlated, depending on what you're looking at over what time frame to the index or whatever is related to it. Lauren says, how much can volatility go up or down in a day? There's no real bound volatility itself can be whatever it is. So you can have stocks that are really cheap that have hundreds of percent of volatility. So yeah, there's not like a ceiling or a floor. Well, I guess floor zero would be the floor for volatility. But as long as anything is still actively trading on the market, obviously wouldn't be zero. So the general tendency to be aware of is that volatility absolutely will normally contract as equities go up or the equity it's tied to. And then same thing inverse to the downside. Now another really, really common misconception is people that are using the VIX and comparing it to other stocks. The VIX is the volatility index or SPX.

The VIX is the volatility index or SPX. It's literally the implied volatility for SPX. If you look at the price of VIX and you look at the implied volatility for SPX, your mind is probably going to be slightly blown. So right now in VIX, the price is 1654. If we take a look, I got to move this thing. If we take a look at a normal chart of SPX, what do you notice that the implied volatility is 16.58. That's all VIX is. VIX is the IV for SPX. So we can use VIX as a proxy for things. But VIX itself is simply tied to the SP 500. It's not descriptive for every equity, every ticker that's out there. Because once you get into individual tickers, you now are introducing individual stock risk, idiosyncratic risk that comes from different things. Did Palantir get the new contract at wanted and so on and so forth. So the way to think about implied volatility is that it's true, mean reversion. It has clustering properties.

But things like Vama is actually really important. Or essentially you can have the Veda of Vega, which is Veda. So on and so forth. Okay. Now another thing to know about volatility is that it is really relative to itself in the individual underlying. So you can have underlines. Let's take a look at an example. Again, we have Walmart. In Walmart has a 32 implied volatility and the 96 implied volatility percentile on a 15 implied volatility range. This is actually a great example of why implied volatility rank is such a terrible metric. The difference between implied volatility percentile and implied volatility rank is pretty simple. Implied volatility percentile, Hakes, the current implied volatility for the stock and it divides it by the total number of periods that you're looking at. And it counts for the numerator, the number of days where volatility is lower than where it is right now. So what this is telling you for the past year, 96 of the time volatility was lower than what it is right now. This is an example of volatility being very high on a relative basis, the Walmart.",

This is an example of volatility being very high on a relative basis, the Walmart. Now the reason why implied volatility rank is all the way down at 15 completely different. And the reason is in the way it's calculated. Implied volatility rank takes the current implied volatility. I guess I could draw it out might be easier. It's going to just do like hand gestures, but that's probably less useful. IVR equals current IV less 52 week. IV low divided by 52 week. IV high less 52 week. So the reason why I do not like implied volatility rank is because it anchors off of these extremes. This and this. And that anchoring is a massive, massive problem. Oh, my bad. I just realized that this should be high. My bad, my bad, my bad. This is 52 week high, not low. I just wonder why that looked weird. So it anchors off of the extremes. So then it completely removes the nuance. And again, the nuance here is if we take a look at IVP. This is simply the count of days. With lower IV than today. Over the period.

So what this is telling you is implied volatility rank is telling you well compared to this anchor. This 52 week high. Current IV is actually pretty low. But it removes the nuance. Maybe this 52 week expected. Or I'm sorry, this 52 week IV high is from 50 weeks ago. That's pretty stale at this point. So it starts to overweight these anchors. Very prone to skew. So the whole idea here between IVP and IVR is to place implied volatility relative to itself. Because a 32 vol in Walmart, as we just mentioned, represents a 96 IVP. If we look at GameStop, we have a 72 implied volatility. This is literally double that of Walmart. Take a look at the IVP. It's fucking 1. It's about as low as it can possibly go. That's the big difference. So I really prefer implied volatility percentile. But both of those are designed to help us put the context around implied volatility, specifically in that of relative to itself. So that's the next part of our TED talk. So that was at 5510. This was implied volatility percentile and rank. Cool. Now, the last thing I want to walk you through. Is a few different ways that we can use and calculate volatility.",

I'm not going to spend a ton of time on this because I imagine. People won't really care that much. But I want you to at least be familiar with the process. So we're going to talk about calculating historic. And implied volatility. So the way that we calculate historical volatility is multifaceted. There's different ways we can do this. So we first need to gather price level data. And a good example of that is what I did here. So this is in Palantir. And all I did was grab price level data. And this price level data is from bar chart. So I just go to bar chart, download it and then dump it in here. And then you'll notice over here, I have a bunch of different calculations. I'm looking at things like the ranges for different periods of time. I'm looking at highs, lows, overnight moves, the day of the week, weekend moves.

And again, depending on the model that you use, it will change what data you calculate. So Yang's Ang calculates the open high low close and includes overnight movements. Parkinson is intraday and it uses high and low and so on and so forth. There's different base models to work off of. Once we get the daily log returns, then we calculate the mean for the period. So what I do is a little bit different, but we can calculate the normalized returns here. That's what this is. And then we can, what I like to do is split it out by two different time frames. And this sheet is designed to be able to look at the entire population data level statistics. And then it can also look at sample level statistics.

So once we have the mean for the period, then we calculate the variance, which is the average squared deviation from the mean. Now the reason why we ask, well, the reason why we do it in this way, the reason why we use log returns versus arithmetic means is because two things it normalizes percentage moves just like a log chart does. And then they're also additive. So it's easier from a math perspective. The mean is just the average. We know why we do that. The variance we're essentially looking at dispersion from the mean here. And there's a reason why we square it. So let's say that this is our mean. This is our line of best fit. And then we're measuring each data point and its relation to the mean.

Now most of the time, and especially when we're looking at markets, we take the square root of it. And the whole point is to take it back down to volatility. This is the actual standard deviation. This is actual volatility at this point. So once you get your data, you do your log returns. You calculate the mean. You calculate the variance. You do the square root of the variance. That gives you volatility. So essentially we put all these up. The power of two. We get all our numbers. And then we square root all of them. We take them back down to the base level metric. So this is what volatility is measuring. It wants to know how far apart are we from the average? Are we far apart? Are we close? That's how we calculate it.

But you have to start from a historical perspective if you're to try and forecast future volatility. Now what most institutions will do is actually use garsh models. And you can get way more specific with garsh models. There's E garsh, E j garsh. I jumped diffusion to count for big overnight or just big powerful moves and stuff like that. So this is where it starts to get obviously more heavy. But you can create a very simple historic model based on this stuff. No problem. And then you can come up with basic ideas. So here you can see I've already calculated things like Garmin, Klaus, Yang, Zang, combined. This is kind of the one I would use personally. If I were to use one of these models, this is an easy starting point. And the reason why this is important is because if you use something like Roger Satchel or if you use close to close or if you use Parkinson, they isolate different variables, but they drop points off that matter to us, even from an intraday or multi day basis.

Reese says what's Garmin and all the other names. So there's Yang, Zang, there's Roger Satchel. There's close to close. There's no name for that. It's just close to close. There's Parkinson and then there's Garmin Klaus. And again, the primary one that is probably worth tinkering with is GKYZ.

This one is, I built this more just for a general project, right, just to help people visualize stuff. And to give you an idea on how you can essentially build your own. But Reese says, I don't know what any of those mean. Great question. Thank you for asking. So the purpose behind these different methods of calculation is essentially they're trying to calculate volatility using different inputs. So for example, close to close. This is essentially taking the close data between days. And that's what it's using to calculate the volatility. Parkinson uses a different series of inputs high low or open close or open",

So the different names are essentially just different approaches. It's the mathematicians who came up with the approach. That's why it's named after them. So one of the reasons why and I gave you kind of like a cliff notes version of that in here. So you can see Parkinson's is high low. It doesn't have any overnight moves included in the calculation. Garmin clause uses open high low close no overnight moves. Yang Zayn essentially uses open high low close includes overnight returns. And then we can combine this and this into GKYZ. But the whole point behind that is just to have different ways to calculate it. Riz says, okay, slightly different variations. Well, slightly different in the concept of it's not like completely different, but the differences between them are massive just to be really, really clear. So like the difference of including overnight returns versus not is is tremendous, very, very big. So Shreys says, jump diffusion reactor in my spaceship is broken hook a brother up. Yeah, man.

So I wish there was more we could do for you in your time of need. But yeah, this is essentially the ins and outs of volatility. Now one last thing I want to talk about before we wrap up is just some really, really basic volatility calculations. So let's update our thing useful volatility calculations. And this is pretty easy. So we know that when we get implied volatility from a platform or something like that again, it's typically 30 day annualized. So then we can do some math to figure out. Sorry, I'm just responding to no. Okay. So you can essentially transform the volatility into different periods. The platform already does that for you. Most platforms already do that. Right. So you can already see the volatility for different periods. So you don't even have to do this. But you should know that it can be done. And this is exactly how you do it. You can take the implied volatility. You can turn it into a one day expected price move. The way you do that is you take the current stock price times implied volatility times",

One day estimate is taking stock price times IV divided by 16 or you can take the reason why 16 is just one over 16 is like one day over 16. Or one day over 252. The square root of 252 is about 16. So it's just a quicker way to get to the number. Then you can look at one week volatility by taking instead of the square root of 252, the square root of 52. And one month by taking the square root of 12. Then as we talked about before, we can calculate different standard deviations by taking the expected move. For two standard deviation, you multiply the expected move by two. For three standard deviation, you multiply the expected move by three. Obviously, it's going to increase the range of the expected move. But then it'll increase the probability of it falling within that range, the standard deviation that that expected move will cover.

And that's essentially the difference between implied volatility and realize volatility. And you could do it a couple different ways. And I was going to show you those here. One of the ways you can do it is by creating a ratio. You can also calculate it just by taking implied minus historic. And that'll also give you a different metric. But IV bias is essentially taking the implied less historic divided by historic. So if this numbers positive, it means that volatility is relatively expensive. If it's not positive, it means volatility is cheap relative to the moves that are being produced. So just two different ways you can calculate either the difference between implied and realized or you can turn it into a little bit of a ratio if you're so inclined. So couple on low calculations for you. If you're interested in trying to transform the expected move calculations into different time frames and then the same thing for the IV bias. A lot. A lot.

I'm not going to be back with information as I could for you because there's a lot to potentially take away from the world of volatility with respect to trading. And it goes back to what we said in the beginning, no matter what you do, you're taking a stake on volatility. So if I buy an option doesn't necessarily I'm inherently saying I think volatility is cheap. I mean that if volatility moves while I'm in the trade, there can be a problem, which takes us back to that original question from Lauren, which is which we never fully answered. And I actually want to circle back to that really quick, which is this idea of being right, but wrong. Let's take a look at what that might look like. So let's take a look at we'll go back to Walmart just because it's a little more normalized in terms of volatility. And let's create a little drawing and Lauren, this is to try to help you with",

So let's say for example, that we buy this call, which is what is this one the 115. So we buy to open the 21 March, 115 call. And we pay let's just call it 42 cents. Now this has a delta of 0.10 and this has a Vega of 0.06. So let's say that we get a plus 1 move, but a minus 2 move in volatility as this is happening. Here's what happens. Your plus 1 move, this gives you plus 10 cents. Your minus 2 volatility during that moves move gives you negative 0.12. So if I net out these two moves, you come out at negative 0.02. This is before we factor in theta, which is another negative 0.02. So once we include theta, you're now at negative 0.04. Here's the scenario that just happened.

Objectively in terms of price, it did exactly what you wanted. It went exactly up. However, if volatility changes by just 2, right now, vol is what we said it was like 32. I think so with vol changes by less than 10. Whatever reason, vol contracts, you lose. Then you add time on top of that, you lose. So the whole point of buying options is you have to account for these other factors, being Vega and theta. So that then you can make build trades. That makes sense. This is why for those that follow most of my work, you know that I buy options that are greater than 60 days out. The reason why we go greater than 60 days out is because what was the delta of that just at a curiosity? We'll use the same delta for that 115, the 10 delta. So let's go out here to 133. Let's find a 10 delta. Notice the difference in this 10 delta that's now out 113 days. What do you notice? If I buy to open, let me use a different color. It might be easier to see.

It's also a function of this severity of the expected move. Because if I think something is going to move a lot, I can make more money by going further out of the money and buying way more of these. But I need a big enough move. So this is why building your trades and using the Greeks to optimize your trades is a nonnegotiable. And as you probably imagine, we have a video on this.

And this is why we talk about that, quote unquote, outlier strategy process. Because if you don't have a clear understanding of what the effect is that you're trying to trade, the probability of you magically just picking the correct options to capture it is about zero. It takes very little effort to take a look at a trade, take a look at a perspective idea, and then to postulate how you might be able to trade it. But you have to actually take the time to know what the fuck you're looking at. So now we know how to integrate vaultally analysis into our trading process. Because we now know the differences between implied and historic. We know the propensity for puts to be priced heavier than calls. We know how to look for relative volatility values and find things that might be priced relatively off compared to surrounding option. We also now know the impact of Vega and other Greeks on the movement of a position. We understand skew. We looked at that one directly.

We understand that volatility and price movements do have a relationship, but it's not causal. You can have them move correlated, not correlated, inversely correlated. Most of the time they're inversely correlated, but it's not most of the time like 90. It's like 75. There's a fair amount of time where it's not so. And then we just reviewed a specific example of being right, but wrong with your trade. And that's something that will happen to beginners. Once you are generally a beat under you, that doesn't really happen as much. So. That's where we're at. Any final questions, anything else that we didn't cover to drive the TLOs for you. Any other misconceptions that you might have heard about volatility that you want to take a second to take a look at together. I'm happy to do either of those for the last few minutes that we have together. Because as you know, volatility is the lifeblood. This is what we do. We need to know about volatility. And it shows up in a lot of different ways. It actually reminds me I need to build it. I need to build a video about avoid being. Probably do that right after this actually.

What does implied volatility measure? So if we see volatility contract, what can we deduce that the market is telling us? And this isn't like put you on the spot and make you feel silly or anything like that. I'm just trying to help you connect the dots because the concepts that we're talking about here is exactly what it is. Bingo, you got the market expects lower moves, smaller moves in the underlying. That's exactly correct. Now we can take it one step further and try to figure out why the market expects slower moves. It could be potentially because there's an abatement of an expected volatile event coming up that's gone away. You'll see this happen all the time in earnings releases, for example, something as an earnings release volatility would be very high pre and then it goes through that volatility contraction. People call it volatility crush through earnings and that's because now post earnings we don't have that event anymore. So great question. That's exactly what it is.

So this is why you still have to size smartly. And this is for one approach. Another approach is the recent trade that I put on in Palantir. This is being managed by size. So it's designed to be a longer term play. And the short term movement is of less interest to me. So this is here not to stop out. This is here for my awareness so that if it falls below this, I might choose to add more to the position. If it consolidates and behaves and yada yada yada all that stuff. So that's another scenario where I'm essentially managing risk by size. And then when I'm trading things like zero DTEs and trading earnings plays. I can rest stops.

Insane examples of awful fills. Because end of day liquidity is starting to tighten up and those kinds of things. And that is a potential. But the whole point of a stop that's where we're saying I need to get out. Here. And if you do something like a stop limit. Then you might not get out. It might blow by the limit. And then you're still in the very same trade that you said you need to get out of. So that's really bad form. So if I'm using a stop it's a stop market. And it's understanding the fact that stop market order suck. And the overwhelming probability is if I get a fill on that stop market order. And that's what that needs to be accounted for in the way that I build a strategy. So. Yeah, stops are fine. You can use them. You have to understand the way that they're going to interact with the position. And even if you have stops you have to account for big moves. Things like let's say for example that I sold calls in this. And let's actually see if we can take a look at it on the third. Enough time has passed. This would be really cool. If we could take",

If this thing chills out. Okay, I can't see that well. So the volatility is around five and a half percent. That's what this thing is showing us right. So the average daily range is five and a half percent. The average true range is about five point one four percent. So we really actually care more about the larger of these numbers, whatever's more volatile. So in my mind, I need to account for at least a five and a half percent move when I put this on.

So if I look back in time, I can literally see that it's had up moves that are 20 plus. I've seen an up move that's 30. So that tells me if I'm going to try to fade this through earnings, I can't plan for a five percent move. I have to plan for something that's much bigger than that. And if I take a look to the upsides, like the average upside gap is like 20 percent. Whereas the average downside gap takes us down to 20 once. And then the rest are around 10, 12, 15. So this tells me that there's significant upside move potential. I would absolutely plan for something 25, 30 to the upside. So let's take a look.

And then if that alert is triggered, I'm going to go and close the trade. So now let's fast forward the trade a day. Funny enough, and I actually did not know exactly where it landed. But funny enough, this is actually in line with expectations based on that earnings move. So I can base the trades in this example. Now, again, even if there's a stop involved, I can plan for some of it. Now the difficult stops are the ones that creep up or gaps, I should say. They can creep up out of nowhere sometimes, but this is where sizing becomes really important in a historical understanding of the ticker that you're looking at is really, really important.

Dejean says, what are your thoughts on using chat GPT to help build custom thingscript codes or to enhance volatility awareness? Sure. Nothing wrong with that at all. I think you just have to understand that chat GPT is imperfect, right? So you have to make sure that whatever chat GPT gives you were at least vetting because it's going to be imperfect. But yeah, there's nothing wrong with that at all. Shreya says, do you think an increase in volatility for indices impact its constituents or do they have individual product? I'm curious of trading shortfall for earnings in a specific company on a day when index ball increase could have the extra juice. It's you actually have it flipped. So if you think of it from a trading perspective, the index ball is built from the constituent ball. Now it's not perfect, but essentially it's the inverse. So if you have something like an individual ticker that's going to be in idiosyncratic risk, it's not really going to care so much necessarily about the index ball unless the index ball is showing you something more market wide than sure from that perspective.

But it's not so much the index ball popping leading to an increase in individual constituent vaults kind of the inverse now. Because that don't know there is an entire style of trading designed around this exact thing. That's why it's pretty efficient called dispersion trading and institutions do this all the time. So from a dispersion trading approach, what you're doing is you're calculating what the actual volatility should be for each stock in the basket of stocks relative to the index and then you trade that dispersion. So there are a lot of institutions that trade that exact thing which keeps it priced typically pretty good. So another really good question. Cool. All right, gang, really great questions. I'm glad that you guys had some interesting stuff to talk about towards the end. It's always fun to take a peek at those a lot. But this session is super important because volatility is the heart and soul of what we do. So now let's take a quick look at what's coming up next. So we just knocked out option volatility. The next one we're going to talk about is the Greeks. So we're going to dive into a little bit of an overview of the Greeks and then more importantly,",

So we're going to dive into a little bit of an overview of the Greeks and then more importantly, how can we practically apply the Greek. So that wraps us up and then for the skills development, we just knocked out the strategy process overview and I'm going to go through and see what other things we want to add. This is actually a great time to ask everybody here for the for the skill development. Are there any specific trading skills that you are trying to work on because if so, I can add them to our list. And then this is what we cover on the Wednesday session for everybody. This is just open fair open game for discussing the elements of skill development. So if there's any specific skills that you're trying to develop, throw them in the chat. Happy to dump those in here. The next session that we have on tap for this is again going to be the Greeks, which is next Friday. As always, if you have any questions or anything you want to cover, let your boy know via an outlier. Let's see you guys later.",
