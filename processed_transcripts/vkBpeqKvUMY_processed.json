It's not just that it gets demonetized. That's annoying, but that's whatever. It's that they'll literally pull the video. So, and T.C. M. King says he leaves sound off. So no copyright, yep, that's exactly correct. And then T.C. M. King, news videos like this should be fine. Yeah, so it's really tricky. The problem with stuff like this is that it is entirely up to discretion. So big other larger entities get a little bit more of a pass than smaller entities like me because smaller entities like me are more likely to use somebody else's brand or information to grow our own brand. It's obviously not what I'm doing at all, but that's the angle. Whereas larger entities, they typically add audience into the sphere. So, they get a much bigger pass. Fun fact, I was actually really, really surprised because T.C. M. King to your point, one of the videos that got copyrighted from a live stream and they literally pulled the whole video down was that video that we talked about the different vaccines. And after that video, like I went through the section that they flagged and they said a couple things about it. And I listened to the section and I realized that it's just kind of like a topic that is really sensitive to",

And I listened to the section and I realized that it's just kind of like a topic that is really sensitive to a lot of entities. And then I was looking at, I was listening to a podcast with Joe Rogan on that was on YouTube. And his podcast was actually kind of smashing some of them and that video was still up. And I'm glad that it is. I'm not saying that I'm upset that there's a double standard or anything like that. That's not it at all. But it does highlight that size, sorry fellas, size does matter. So it applies in this space very much. So yeah, that's why I'm super careful about it. Now for those that are curious about things like fair use, fair use, that's the problem with fair uses. It doesn't have a definition. Fair use is like a very open-ended, laissez-faire thing. So I am convinced that I could easily play clips of this like if we wanted to listen, right, we can listen to that just fine. There's no problem if I play a little bit here and there and then I add some transformative overlay language on top of it.

We officially had somebody from Greenland, which is pretty fucking sick, I think. And we have the US is a shotgun blast. South America looks quiet. Africa still blank. But in fact, my good friends actually go into Africa. So I might have to have him dial into one of these live streams at a obscene time so that I can at least put a little pin on the map in good faith. We got Australia. I think there was somebody that said they were from New Zealand, there's New Zealand. So we have good coverage. So if you've not let me know where you're from, throw it in the chat at any point.

I'm not going to lie. I don't see all they do have options. This is great. So we could just use trading view and plastic. All right, so let's grab this map over here now. We'll just let think or swim continue to ground on the background until it gets its act together. Move you guys over here. In case you're wondering above my head here, this is Iceland. This is one of the glacial slides that we cruised up on. This is from my drone. Game stop. There we go. The joke is they're trying to keep me down as I'm trying to look at this stuff. Sometimes joking aside, it can feel like that. Obviously it's not what's actually happening, but it makes me feel generally annoyed. All right,",

Let's go back, let's find another previous Friday. Friday November 29th. Wait, why does this? Is it a half day? We got to go back more. Friday, the 24th. Oh, interesting. What is this spike? 57, 45, nothing. Okay. So that's probably just chasing ghosts. I could do a broader statistical analysis on intra-day. But I kind of want to do it. I don't want to waste your guys' time, but I kind of want to do it. Because what I would like to do is grab intra-day minute level data from GameStop. And I can go back like at least the past month. And I can look at the number of instances where GameStop has higher than average intra-day volume at 1045. The problem is there's not a ton we learn from it. But it's just kind of like a non-curiosity that I have. Let me do it real quick. It's not going to take me that long. I actually can probably get GPT or something like that to do this.

Can you please save? I think it saved. OK, great. Now it's saved. Maybe I just had to ask nicely instead of insulting it. It's almost like there might be something to that. OK, so now I'm going to have it analyze plot the average plot of volume at 1045 to 1100 against the one day average. Let's do it against the average 15-minute volume for the same day. Identify the dates where there is anomalous volume at 1045, exceeding the average 15-minute volume by at least 2x. Do that says. I'm curious how well this will work for me. Little C. In the meantime, I'm going to keep eyeballing a little bit. OK. So it has a handful of instances. This is interesting. This is very interesting. So let's go to November 7. I'm going to change this to 15 minutes. So it's easier to navigate 15 minutes. And let's go to November 7. And there's one other thing I'm going to look at.

I mean, the volume doubled there, but that doesn't. It's not that crazy. OK, so now what I want to do is create a plot. To identify the three most common 15-minute periods where volume expands at least. What do you want to look at? What is this? How do you view the volume on this other? It is OK. Volume is 720, 740. So at least 2x from the intro day, 15-minute average, proceeding. OK, so to run down what I just found from the original looking at 1045, there are a few days that 1045 had anomalous volume. More than I would have expected, honestly, in a relatively short sample, it was at least five instances, six instances. So there's probably something from a programmatic standpoint when things are set to go. Now what I'm doing is I'm trying to identify, and it's exactly what I would expect. So the three most common 15-minute periods with volume expansion is 0,930. It's exactly what you would expect 1545 exactly what you would expect. And then 0,945, which is not what you would expect necessarily. So this seems generally in line with expectations. So what that tells me from this movement that we saw over the last couple days, we would need to",

Like I wouldn't feel comfortable saying that without a doubt, there's something going on here, like at the 1045 handle, because it's just two data points. It's weird. And in the world of data analysis, a lot of times what we do is we find things that are weird. And then we pay close attention to them because we want to know if it's something that's persistent, if there's something behind it for some reason. But I do think there's something potentially behind that time frame. I just don't know what. But that's also not a bizarre time frame for transaction activity to start picking up. We're getting into like the last trading couple hours of the day. Volume will often expand during that time frame. So yeah, interesting. But not totally anomalous. Because again, one of the reasons why I wanted to see how many instances did we see volume for the 1045 candle expanding the average 15 minute volume by at least two times. And it happened quite a few times. I see six instances where it was way more than that. And quite a few more instances where",

Why can't I use this? Yo, these guys are haters. You can't put shit on his chart without buying it. Bastards. What's this thing do? That's not the same, but that would be fine if I can use this. Yeah, fine. Whatever. This is whoever made, whoever made this thing, I appreciate your effort. It is not at all what I want. This is. Poe Vey. Never mind, gang. Let's just get rid of that. And let's.

And what I'm noticing is prices consolidating pretty well. And I want to drive that point home because since prices consolidating pretty well, I find that to be really positive.

That's literally just because I don't really watch anybody stuff. But I'll try to catch some of his stuff sometimes or I'll ask him some messages like we'll text back and forth.

April 2020 GameStop price bottomed under two COVID-19 impacts, shorting, triple to six. So this just looks like it's talking about. This looks like it's just talking about like the price path of it. Dusty Dust says he said to him in his video. That's awesome. That's great news. That's just a win across the board. Did he say what made him change his mind? I'm just gonna text him. I'm really curious. Okay. Okay. So, what is this? Most argues that GME's leadership likely supports a share recall. Okay. Well, that didn't happen. See, this is the kind of thing I am genuinely kind of happy that we can skip through some of it because if the ultimate thesis turns out to be something that's just not what happened. Is this another post that I did I go too far? Fuck. I'm lost now. Hold on. Nope. Didn't mean to do that. I meant this. Okay. So this is the next post. I just want to read their TLDR.

I think there's just too much and a lot of it. It's just the same. Yeah. There definitely is a lot. There ain't too much dog. You guys don't understand. Well, maybe you do. Maybe you don't. But literally the world of a trader is sifting through massive amounts of information, quickly trying to decipher as much as you possibly can and then making decisions off of it. So for me, this really isn't that much work. And here's the cool part. If I'm not mistaken, built in AI assistant, it needs the stuff just to be less than I think it said 400 pages, which we're coming up on that. So what I'll do is I'm literally going to split this PDF into two different PDFs so that then we can use the native AI, which I think will be much quicker. That's my that's my ultimate game plan.

The creation of millions of naked shares with married put trades. Put volumes appear to be sustained at higher levels to keep rolling over. I don't agree with this conclusion outright.

Yeah, anytime I have them, I don't really recall like a bunch of flavor from them. I just kind of know that I eat them. Perfect. All right.",

Oh, you mean from Chinese? I'm like a chicken with broccoli. Chicken with broccoli is good or sesame chicken. If it's like spicy, you could put a little spice in there. That's pretty good. Yep. So she's passing on this. I'm going to ask her up pennies. See if she wants that instead. All right. Let's get back into this while she's sorting her life out. Okay. Bye, right. Here we go. Simultaneous sale of calls with the purchase of equivalent amount of shares underlying. So this is a really, really common. This is a really common strategy for larger style funds and things like that or people that are trading for income. I was actually just going to open up the thinkorswim platform to show you the risk profile of it. And obviously I cannot do that. So what I can do is draw a perfect Mel would do Chinese.

We'll do this, this, and this. So you guys should be able to. Perfect. So here's a buy right. I can buy it open 100 shares of GameStop. And the risk profile for this, are you guys familiar with what a risk profile is? Risk profile just plots the PNL of something. So this is a zero line. This is your negative return. This is positive return. And then this is stock price. This is stock at zero, which is today right now. And then this is stock as it goes up. And then this is stock as it goes down. So when you buy 100 shares at spot price, it'll look something like not that, that, right? So what this does is it means as GameStop goes up, you make money as it goes down, you lose money. I think everybody's pretty comfortable and familiar with that. Now, a buy right is when we do this first trade, and then we pair it with the second trade, which is when we sell to open",

So rather than having unlimited upside potential like you see here, the other trade would look like this. This one takes this departure. And it's because you're collecting money upfront on the call. So a lot of people do this when they are getting into stocks that they really like, that they want a hold, that they don't mind holding. And it's a way to collect a little bit of a premium literally while you're getting into something that you want to be in anyways.

But what this does is if you remember the first line, this here is stock at zero. This is what long stock looks like. When we look at the buy right, it looks like this. Let me use a different color. Buy right will look like this. And then a married put will instead look like this. So won't go past the zero line. So this is the difference. This is what a buy right will look like. If I were to extrapolate it out by itself, it would be like this. And the purpose of this is you limit your downside. So this means if GameStop goes down to zero, your max loss is capped here. And it looks great, right? Like why wouldn't everybody do this? Well, most people don't do it because it's really expensive to buy the puts. It's really, really expensive on a relative level.

I'm not looking through this whole thing. Joe says, okay, I do know what I do know what buying to open covered calls and so on. I didn't know it was a buy right. It's just called a buy right. And it's not right as in right or left. It's right as in writing. Like you're writing an option. That's an old way of saying selling an option. People don't really use that anymore writing an option, but that's an old way of saying selling an option. You write an option. So that's why it's called a buy right because of just older school language. Okay. When associated with the activity issue, my inputs typically employ deep in the money puts.

Here we go. Periodically, security's become hard to borrow and where the large and persistent fails to deliver in a security end up threshold security list. These situations give rise to pricing differentials and the options of these securities and the pull call parity equation may appear out of balance, which is in part a reflection of higher borrowing rates on these securities. When the shares become hard to borrow, the synthetic position typically trades at a price that are less than the actual shares. This reflects the risk that shares cannot be borrowed and will have to be bought in compliance with the right show closeout requirements. In the extreme, these price differences can be quite large creating profit, potential profit opportunities and certain options trading strategies for those who are able to short the underlying equity securities without paying the high cost typically associated with obtaining delivery hard to borrow security. That result short. Yep. Makes total sense. I dig all of this. This is really like, I think they did a good job outlining this because it's super, super clear.

I and I 100 agree with that. But I think that we can't make the leap that we're saying this is that it's evidence that there's 140 million FDDs being hidden because FDDs happen to coincide with call activity because we can see that FDDs also skyrocket here. And then there's really no significant rise in the call activity. So same thing here. So as a causal relationship, I don't know if it gets that. Now when things get to an extreme like this, which looks like during the 2021 move, it's no surprise that you would see everything start to get out of whack at that point. So it's not to say that there's nothing behind this. I completely agree. But I just I think that you can't make a causal relationship a definitive causal relationship.

My guess is the shorts would do one of two things. They would either just close the shorts and then reopen them. Their basis is not sensitive in that way. Or they might they might just wade through the perceived short squeeze and size the trades that they can withstand what they would again preemptively be thinking is going to happen in front of these big moves. So this is really tricky because you can see volume and you can see options activity in general expand ahead of big moves. And part of it, I think 100 is likely due to some of this activity for sure. But I also think a lot of it is people speculating things get active progressively. And we can we can pick up on those artifacts in the options chain. That's exactly and I've told you guys this a million times. This is exactly how I found GameStop when I started as a content creator is because I happened to have caught it on a few different scans.

But me detecting some options volume is what originally drew me into this most recently. We see that SI decreased massively after all the suspicious call activity in late Jan as well as getting FDD under controls. And here's the other problems that there's other ways that they can kick these FDDs around. So yeah, I'm sure that once the FDDs get to an extreme that they're probably moving.

And the OTC data post user shows institutions involved at these dark pools do in fact, home shares of GME, they're trading over 100,000 shares they own. I don't understand this conclusion. First I said GME is one of the hardest stocks to short right now, but the reason the bar rate is so low is because there's almost zero demand. The part that I don't understand this can all be, right? The fact that hedge funds are deep in a hole have not covered that I can all see. But this is the part that I don't understand is trading high volumes in dark pools in an attempt to kick the can. I don't understand the relationship that they're making here with the volume in dark pools and how that kicks the can. If you guys know the answer to that, I would love to know. I just don't understand that one. GME is insanely hard to bar right now, a very little demand to short it. Dark pool activity helps us further explain the FDD cycle. Why do we see these spikes",

SEC regulation forced them to cover, but why does it keep happening? They'll make it shorting. Why else there would be this much potency activity? I agree with that. I think the other thing to at least highlight from something like this without a doubt is there's other shit that happens into the 35 calendar day cycle, right? There's also standard options, explorations and movement of the underlying that's going to feed into this. But I absolutely agree with this. They're going to naturally just continue to move things down down the road. So yeah, I think that that's a completely fair point. RRTD says that effects price discovery, especially when 80-90 of the trades are in the dark pool. Yeah, no, no, I don't just agree with that.

There's just a delay and it's not that long, typically. So dark pool trades absolutely do not help price discovery, but it also eventually, typically pretty shortly thereafter, is integrated into the consolidated tape. The stuff that really fucks price discovery is internalization. That butchers price discovery holistically because that stuff will not hit a consolidated tape. So to me, it's interesting that dark pools, it's probably because the name, the name sounds so much more nefarious than it actually is, but dark pools are visible to everybody. It's just a slightly delayed reporting structure and it is combined with the consolidated tape. Most of the buys go to the dark pool and the cells go to the market. Yeah, but I still understand that because they both will be integrated into the consolidated tape. So I don't see how high volumes in dark pools kicks the proverbial can of open shorts down the road. Like that, I just don't get. Where Inclity says volume can hide FTDs. If you buy and sell, you can settle the old FTDs so they can do this in the dark pools. That",

So the idea is that not necessarily the fact that it's dark pools, but that they're transacting to satiate the requirement and then they're subsequently unwinding to maintain the original position. Where Inclity says because they do shady shit in the dark pool, spoofing for example, spoofing is not relegated to the dark pool. Spoofing happens all the time on on broad markets. And that's more of a high frequency trading thing. So dark pools themselves are no more prone to something like spoofing them anything else, but on a standard brokerage platform, you're going to see spoofs all the time. That's just a game played between high frequency traders and market makers. What DC says visibility doesn't really matter here though. It's about the average retail traders thinking they're buying shares in a company, but it's actually getting FTD. That's kind of different. Like those are two different things. The function of a retail trader buying something is different than the FTD function that's happening.

And the way that it artificially suppresses price is because these otherwise entities would be forced to go and purchase the shares to satisfy the short, which increases demand drives price up. So the fact that that is not happening in the shorts are being maintained. That is a massive problem. Warren Clity says, have you read anything about Dr. Trimbath? I think I did. She has a ton of good info on all the issue work for the DC upcrypt, the DRS process wrote a book about FTD's naked trinity. Yeah, I'm pretty sure I watched an interview with her. But yeah, your description for this is completely satisfactory. It makes a ton of sense. OTC data adds credence to the idea that FTD cycle is getting more and more expensive. Short short term, increasing the positions rapidly. I don't disagree with that. They purposely sit on themselves and are waiting for proposed regulatory rules to take effect. So the squeeze doesn't destroy the financial system. Short short term using dark pools to suppress buying pressure to drop the price by rapidly. Yes. So this would make sense by rapidly trading.

Short short term using dark pools to suppress buying pressure to drop the price by rapidly. Yes. So this would make sense by rapidly trading. The thing that makes this work is not the fact, again, that it's dark pools to suppress. This is just the conclusions here are a little misleading to me because this is the function rapidly trading between each other. That absolutely would do it. FDD cycle is persistent, exemplifies the Neutrality Problem as Dr. Trimbath discussed, which you guys already highlighted. Very rise with this results of force coverings, January drop, these still have large positions. Funds are working in tandem because they're both in too deep and it's futile and just delaying the inevitable activity on GME containing ETFs to demonstrate how desperate they are getting. Yep, I think we've seen that. Because the other thing that I don't know if it was known at this point in time in here, that one of the things that was really, really interesting is the ETF creation redemption cycle. That's also literally like a glitch to satisfy FDDs. And that's another massively abused process as far as I'm concerned. Super interesting. I like this one. Cool. It is about time for me to hop off. But before we do that, is there anything else that we should take a look at? I'm down to take a peek at anything else real",

Stop point. Seven Ds. Post. But God our spot where we're going to pick back up from. All right, let me see what you guys have. Unvaxmas says do you believe in synthetic shares and hidden short interest? Yeah, definitely. 100. Synthetic shares are used all the time and synthetic shares are a really cost effective way for them to do things. That's actually what that other thing we were reading earlier that I posted in the chat is all about. So 100. It's not even like do I believe in it? It's like straight up proven. It's factual. The hidden high short interest. I absolutely have suspicions that it's a thing. It's harder for me to prove it, but I absolutely think it's a thing. So that one is a little bit larger of a leak, a leap of speculation on my end because I can't just screely prove it like I can some of this synthetic process. But I absolutely think it's occurring. I also think anytime that you have a company that is over 100 shorted, which we absolutely have seen is",

Rantitti says synthetic shares are counterfeit shares unless you're a market maker. I think that's a little bit too big of a leap personally because retail traders can use synthetic shares. There's like there's genuinely use cases for them. You can create synthetic long synthetic shorts. Like it's a viable strategy. Now to your point, which I fully agree with, I'm just, I don't want to demonize synthetics because synthetics, there's nothing inherently wrong with them. The problem with synthetics in the context of market making is complete and utter bullshit. It's literally being used to hide and defer FTDVs. The problem in that process in my opinion is not synthetics, but it's the FTD process and the deferral. And synthetics happen to be a vector that they've exposed that they can do it through. And again, in my opinion, like that's complete madness. That is complete fucking madness. But it's a fucking unfortunate thing as it is, I suppose. Yeah. WTDC says trade should be settled. We've had the tech do that for over a decade, but it is in profitable market plumbing, like hedge funds, market makers, brokerages completely agree with",

And I also think that it's fucking crazy that and this is in on like it is the absolute problem when you have an entire market structure system that is solely cared about liquidity. Like that being the primary focus is a massive problem because it contorts what policy goes into effect to then enable liquidity and sometimes liquidity should dry the fuck up in a natural process as it should. So I completely agree with that as well. Rointitie says they're selling shit. They don't own and didn't borrow. Again, synthetics can be done different ways. So I just I would caution you against demonizing synthetics because say, for example, as soon as you're integrating options, you still are taking on a liability depending on what you build. The problem that I have with them is that they're doing it in the context of trying to cover a position that they have not covered. Like that's utter and complete bullshit. It literally is bullshit, especially from an entity like market makers, they should literally be forced to satisfy those positions because it's the only way that you can maintain legitimacy of the system.
