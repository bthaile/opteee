    "text": "Happy Friday, everybody. It's the 5th of July. And I want to talk through the expiration cycle for today. A lot of options came off. We can see a lot went back out over 200 and 39,000 calls transacted today, which is a heavy number compared to what we saw back on the 3rd of June, which it was actually starting to slow down for a couple days. And we definitely accelerated back up today being over 200,000 calls again. We did see puts also expand. We have 75,000 puts traded today. Heavy, heavy, heavy callsque. No doubt about it in terms of transactions. Now, if we take a look at where the majority of these transactions occurred and calls notice 37 of the transaction today were at the bid or below. These are sales. These are people selling calls. Then the 29, those are people buying calls. If we look on the put side, most people came in slight edge by one point over the bid where 32 came in at the offer, those people buying puts. So this is expectation of downside by a very slight edge. And then this is not necessarily expectation of downside. This can be covered calls, but that still would benefit from a slight down move on the options perspective. Obviously, if you sell a covered call, you still want the underlying to go up. That's where Max profit in the trade lies. So let's take a look at what's going on here,",

That's where Max profit in the trade lies. So let's take a look at what's going on here, quick recap of the week. Now, when we see what open interest is about to fall out of these, before today, well, before today's the volume is integrated into this, I should say, we had 894,000 calls against 526K puts. Now, if we go into this expiration of the five July, we're going to lose almost 200,000 calls. They're going to expire. They're going to be gone. And then on the put side, we're going to lose 84,000. So what's going to happen here is this essentially 900,000 calls is going to drop almost by 200K. So there's still going to be really heavy call, oh, I skew. But we're starting to move out obviously into the next cycles, 12 July, which I know right now has been sent into me a few times that that's apparently an expiration cycle to look out for based on the T 35 cycle. And it looks really quiet from an options perspective so far. We see 79,000 calls versus 40,000 puts small, very small. Now, the reason why this matters is, I told you guys this a lot now, but it's important to reiterate, these non-standard expiration, the weeklies, especially in smaller products",

Now, the reason why this matters is, I told you guys this a lot now, but it's important to reiterate, these non-standard expiration, the weeklies, especially in smaller products like GameStop are going to be slower. And it's because of liquidity, markets look for liquidity. So if we go out to the 19 July, I will bet you these will be much higher. And they are. These are at 256, triple six. Uh-oh, there's that number again. I guess it's quad six, so it doesn't really count. There goes that. No need to do any burning sage around here, I suppose. So we have 256,000 calls versus 141K on the put side in 19 July. We go out to 26 July. It's 45 to 15 to aug 15 to five. Nine aug is 1900 to 500 super quiet and nine aug and then 16 aug is the next one I really wanted to look at was 124 to 71. So we are maintaining call skew still. This is important to keep a close eye on because it's very telling in terms of how people are positioning going into the future, which is a big part of what we're trying to monitor here because if we look at GameStop and if we zoom in, let's do like a three-month daily, we have been sideways for almost in, oh, wrong thing.",

We've been sideways for a really long period of time here. So if we take kind of from there to there, it's really hard to see just because there's such a distortion here. I'm not using a log chart, but this will help a little bit. You can see that like we're essentially hovering 27 to 23. It's just bouncing in between there. Slight decline through there again. I really don't believe much of standardized technical analysis with products like this because of how unique it is, but it is good to look at. All the moving averages are super compressed. I have a bunch of different moving averages. There's like a 714 21 50 200. I essentially do a visual MACD. I don't use the oscillator. I can just see it here and track the widths, but they're also compressed. They essentially look like one line. It's just heavy consolidation, supremely heavy consolidation. Going back now to the options though, what does this mean going forward? Well, it means a few things. The very first thing is we need to pay pretty close attention to where we're starting to see volume flowing in. So we can see that there's",

The very first thing is we need to pay pretty close attention to where we're starting to see volume flowing in. So we can see that there's a lot of volume today. This is probably people trying to get out of positions and collect a few pennies to save what money they can. Notice all these blue dots. Those are for today's expiration. So if we kill that and we look at the next series of interesting expressions, now the blue dots are 12 July and that's kind of people are just moving out one week. That's what we're seeing. Everybody's trying to maintain as much sensitivity to the front expiration cycle because that's where the perception is of these really big moves happening, which right now it's generally quiet. Inplied volatility is high, but it's low on a relative basis. So what that means is if we take a look up here and we take a look at the IV by itself, it's at 127. The IV rank is all the way down at 23 and then the IV percentile is up at 73. If you're unfamiliar with IV rank versus percentile, IV percentile is less prone to skew whereas IV rank is very prone to skew. That's actually why IV rank looks so low compared to IV percentile.

That's actually why IV rank looks so low compared to IV percentile. But for something like GameStop, implied volatility can fly off the handle any second. So even though IV percentile is still showing elevated here, I think it's because if we look back over the past year, it had such periods of supremely depressed volatility. So I actually think a better metric is to kind of use from like the third of May forward and project your volatility out of this, which would be a little bit more representative of kind of this near term paradigm that we're in with respect to volatility for GameStop. So when I look at this, I'm not seeing anything jumping out at me in terms of huge positions being built. I'm seeing lighter volume for these at the monies out in 16 August. I see in the 19 July's a little bit of heavier volume here at the 25s here again at the 30s. So there's some standard buildout happening, but it's not to the same degree.

The thing with the 125s again to remember, we've had a couple conversations about this in the comments, which are really, really good to have, I think. There's a mix of reasons why these 125s go on, or the really far out of the money, so it's not unique to the 125s. It really boils down to a cheap position that can do a lot of different things for you. So some people speculate that the majority of this volume is coming from institutions, and I still don't see that. The reason being is because you can use these for kind of a locates synthetic. The problem with that theory is that there's very few instances that those locates are going to correspond in less than 10 lot contracts, which is the majority of what you see here. And then the argument I hear kind of in retort to that, which is a good argument is, well, couldn't they split up their orders? They can. The problem if they do that, and you're trying to fill something that's worth several tens of thousands of shares of GameStop with respect to locates, is this would have to essentially be a constant feed of less than 10 lots. It would have to be all day in order for them to put a position on, which also becomes detectable,",

It would have to be all day in order for them to put a position on, which also becomes detectable, right? Because we can then see, well, wow, there's been a lot of volume at specific strikes in a given day, you can pick up on those cues. And that's what this does down here. I can say, well, okay, there's obviously a big activity going on. And this is out in the 19 July at the 125's, but it's still only 10,830 volume. That's not insignificant, but that's still not going to clear a meaningful amount of locates if somebody is using it for that purpose. They would need a much larger position. So I'm not saying that that's not happening, but I don't think that's the only thing that's happening. As I look through this specifically, when I see all of these one lots, two lots, three lots, to me, a lot of these instances boil down to small retail traders, hoping to hit a big. These are, this is the quintessential purchasing behavior of retail traders. And there's a lot of studies on SSRN on this exact topic that you should check out because there's a certain tendency to look for cheap alternatives. And the people that are going out really short explorations, 12 July, 19 July",

But the overwhelming probability there is that it is going to vaporize over the next couple days. Now again, to steal man that perspective, if we do get the move in that time frame, those cheap options are going to fly off the handle. And they're going to be worth a ton of money. That's if it's a very different style to approaching than my personal take. And I will always remind you guys the way I look at things, the way I do things is not the only way. There's other ways to do this stuff. But I care about creating success over a long term time frame. I've this my 17th year of trading. And it's literally changed my life doing this stuff. And it's very cool to see people that find those one off positions that happen to take off into the stratosphere. That's really fun.

That's a tough way to predicate your future wealth on being the winner of the lotto. That's why a lot of times when you'll see my positions on here and off here, I go to all different kinds of time frames. So now I'm out even further to the 105s. And the reason why I'm out here is because that's where I found liquidity for the options that I wanted, which were slightly in the money. It's just a different approach. And again, not saying mine's right or wrong. But the other thing you'll notice about why I'm at is volatility is quite a bit cheaper than some of these shorter slash midterm exploration cycles. But I'm getting a lot of deltas by going at slash in the money so that if there is a big move, yeah, I have a higher deductible and paying more upfront. But I will actually see a higher gross profit. So that's the way I'm looking at this. And I am trading all the small moves. When you see me do these different videos, this will be here. This will not be here.

So you have to figure out what's right for you. I am absolutely keeping a really close eye. I actually just partnered with my friends over at unusual whales, which takes kind of that spreadsheet you've guys seen me do before. And it makes it a little easier. I still like being able to download the data to aggregate it and stuff like this. But this does let me comb through specific date ranges very quickly to look for interesting positions.

That's the kind of thing that I like to keep an eye on. Because as people are trying to build positions, this is kind of telling to see this style of activity. If it's persistent because 100,000 position is big, but it's also not crazy. So this is absolutely something that I want to keep an eye on until you notice this little thing right here. You see there's says multi leg. That matters to me. The reason why that matters to me is because if I'm looking for straight up positions that are gaining direct exposure, I don't want there to be multiple legs because they're looking to offset some of the risk of that position. So I'm typically looking for straight buys that really display conviction in the direction. So there's a little bit of support there for it, but there's nothing very interesting happening yet.
