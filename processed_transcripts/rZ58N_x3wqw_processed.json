    "text": "happy Friday everybody it's the 5th of July and I want to talk through the expiration cycle for today a lot of options came off we can see a lot went back out over 239,000 calls transacted today which is a heavy number compared to what we saw back on the 3rd of June which it was actually starting to slow down for a couple days and we definitely accelerated back up today being over 200,000 calls again we did see puts also expand we have 75,000 puts traded today heavy heavy heavy call skew no doubt about it in terms of transactions now if we take a look at where the majority of these transactions occurred in calls notice 37 of the transaction today were at the bid or below these are sales these are people selling calls then the 29 those are people buying calls if we look on the put side most people came in slight Edge by one point over the bid where 32 came in at the offer so there's people buying puts so this is expectation of downside by a very slight Edge and then this is not necessarily expectation of downside this can be covered calls but that still would benefit from a slight down move on the options perspective obviously if you sell a covered call you still want the underlying to go up that's where Max profit in the trade lies so let's take a look at what's going on here",
