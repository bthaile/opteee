    "text": "things are heating up in GameStop. If you can see up here after hours, we're getting a little bit of a run. I don't want to be too hyperbolic. This isn't the end of days kind of move, but this is also not an insignificant kind of move. Like I continue to remind you, guys, my goal is not to spread hyperfied. It's to call it as best as I can see it. And you can see it being really active right now after hours. Most of the usual, it is hovering right around 29 and a half. It almost cracked 30. I'm not sure if it actually got above 30 or not. I wasn't following it the entire time, but it was really close. I was actually going to do this video when it broke above 30. And I haven't seen it do it yet, but maybe it will while we're on here, or maybe it already has, and it will again, who knows. But let's talk about what's going on in GameStop. The very first thing I notice is this drift continues, and it's accelerating, like pretty meaningfully. So we still have this term low on the first of July, and we've just been slowly rotating up and out just like this. The other thing that's important to note, take a look at our volume. It's expanding. And today, it's now above essentially a two week reference range. That's what this is. This is a two week average.",

And today, it's now above essentially a two week reference range. That's what this is. This is a two week average. And you can see we are now tracking up above it, which is not insignificant. And the majority of this is by volume, 20 of the volume today was sale volume. And yesterday it was a pretty light percentage of sale volume here as well. So there's buying going on. We can see that. We can also see this starting to rotate up. And there's a couple things that kind of line up really well here. I want to, as always, give a shout out to my friend Newton, who's, he does a tremendous amount of work on this thing. And he's like just so, so, so well versed on all the background. He and I have been talking at least touch and base most days, just sharing some ideas back and forth. And his sheet is really useful to kind of get an idea of some of these different timing components. And he does a great job keeping this thing up to date with things like XRT volume with things like FTDs, also with things like tracking creation. And this column here is actually really useful in case you're not paying attention to it. Because he's trying to forecast",

And this is getting really interesting because there's a mix of things going on that I can see from the sheet. I don't want to pretend like I know anything about this anywhere near to the degree that he does. So he's the arbiter of truth. Go watch his stuff about this. It's fantastic. I just follow along with the two because I find it fascinating. The punchline as far as I see it right now is there are some interesting relationships going on with respect to FTD cycles and redemption cycles that seem to be feeding into some of the price activity that we're seeing. Now getting back closer to my sphere, which is options. Here's what we got going on. Huge call volume today. As let me open this up to encapsulate all strikes, you'll see that there is 344,000 calls traded today against 89,500 puts. So massive call skew in terms of OI. I mean, in terms of volume, sorry, to be specific. Actually, I bet you it's in terms of OI as well. Let's take a look. Also",

Also in terms of OI, not anywhere near is extreme though, because we're looking at 891,000 calls to 5,000 or I'm sorry, 500,000 puts. So it's still a pretty big call skew, but not quite as much in OI as volume is we take a look across these explorations. The lions share this 344,000 lives in this front expiration. It's crazy. 214,500 all for this week. case you guys didn't know it's Tuesday. Got a couple days left here three days. It's not necessarily a ton of time. Ah, great. Those short calls are in the money. As I was actually talking to some folks in the discord, really all we needed was me to offer some short options against my long options in long stocks in order to get the rally effort. Got right. That's how the market is. No matter what you put on, it'll find a way to make you wrong. So I mean, honestly, I should apologize to everybody because all I needed to do was to add some short options against the long deltas and then obviously it would rip my face off. Why wouldn't it?

The reason why this gets interesting is as these get closer to falling in the money, which they are right now as we're talking, as you can see up here, as these get closer and closer to falling in the money, market makers have to do something with their position to hedge their risk in the event that these are in the money come expiration because then they're on tap to start delivering shares. So that means that they need to find them somewhere. So if that does start to happen, that likely will lead to some sort of buying pressure on GME. How high does it launch from there? It really depends on how many people scale into this because there's a lot of weakness after this strike. Like again, let's just keep it a buck. After the 30s, the 30 and a halves are dry. The 31s are small. The 31 and a halves are dry. The 32s start to offer something, but still not a ton. 33s are light, 34s are light. It doesn't start getting bigger until the 35s. So it would need to find a pretty big breath of fresh air and have enough wind of its back. Even if it does fall into the 30s for all of that buying pressure to move us five points from 30 to 35 can happen. Absolutely can happen. Want to be clear about that. But it wouldn't necessarily be quite as simple as this buying volume.",

If these do fall in the money immediately means we go there, it probably would require a little bit broader participation and stuff like that. We'll have to see. So the other thing I want to look at super fast is the volatility here. So let me open up all series. We're going to take a look at the implied volatility. We're going to look at the out of the money as per usual. And interestingly enough, I'm going to kill it to just these two so it's a little less noisy. Notice all these kinks showing up. That happens when there's a big change in volatility. When the market is trying to synthesize new information, new data coming out, new behaviors, you'll see this happen right here. And this is pretty interesting because again, as I always say, it's tradable. But more importantly than that, as we typically see, the put side is growing pretty massively as per usual. And the call side is expanding, but not quite to the same degree. And from an expiration cycle, these two are popping a lot. This is now broke above 200. This is broke above 175.

These op-x weeks are really important because these are way more liquid. And this is where a lot of activity is going down. And we don't have another big opportunity here until 16 August, which is 31 days away from here. If we take a look at the OI for 16 August 162 K versus 89. So already positions being built there, but not necessarily huge, huge positions just yet. So a lot of volume today, a lot of it centered in the 19 July people are getting very, very active out here with like 19 July 30s. Like I said, 57,000 of those came through today. So if we take a look at these 19 July 32 calls, 3,000 of those came through at 98 cents, not a massive position, but not an insignificant position to kind of help people see this more clearly. People tend to see this side a little better,",

People tend to see this side a little better, which is totally understandable. I get that. Let me get rid of these puts. We're just going to look at the call side coming in at the offer or above. And we can see 571,000 dollar trade came on for the nine August expiration. So this is a little further out. 16 August still getting hit. October 18th getting hit. 26 July getting hit. So there's a lot of this bigger exposure being added in these further explorations. So as I limit this to this coming expiration cycle, it's not as active, which I find a little interesting to be honest with you. I would have expected with the price movement we've been seeing the last few days to see more people coming into these near term explorations, but this also does line up with some of the redemption cycles and the delivery cycles that we've been discussing on the Saturday live streams with Newton, which we have another one this coming Saturday. Don't forget to tune in. It's already up on the channel for you to go check out and set an alert for when it launches. But I would have expected to see more of this in these",

It's already up on the channel for you to go check out and set an alert for when it launches. But I would have expected to see more of this in these near term explorations, but they're all over the place. People are building positions out, which is still, I mean, there's a lot of money here, right? All the way down here is the first, the first cycle that's less than a hundred thousand dollars. So essentially this entire page almost is over a hundred thousand dollar trades. This is completely different than what we've been seeing lately. Again, like if I go back to the ninth of last week and we take a look there, we had one trade that was 200k, everything else, sub 100,000, the vast majority in 30 and 20,000. Who cares about that? You know, just peasant money over there. We active out here on the 16th now, looking at millies being thrown around between these two positions right here, you have a million bucks. And then you probably have another million in change in this series. So there's money coming into this thing, which is very exciting to watch. Now, a little bit early, I think to read too far into it because a lot of things need to align in order for this to really start accelerating. But I think a big, big part",

Now, a little bit early, I think to read too far into it because a lot of things need to align in order for this to really start accelerating. But I think a big, big part that will be useful to see is the redemption cycle coming up in the creation cycle and how that impacts the underlying. We see these building out more. So the 30s out in 16 aug 2400 contracts were added net over yesterday with another 50 hundred volume today out here at the 40s. There's 12,000, oh, I 1500 added 3677 volume today. So people are scaling into these positions like that's very, very clear to me. And it's centralized in the standard expiration cycles 19 July 16 August. That's where most of this stuff are. As you guys can tell, I tend to put my positions a little further out. I took the 18 October is down today because they showed a sizeable profits. I went very deep in the money. I had those for a while now as you can tell I'm not using the pass through account for this one mostly because I wanted to make the joke about this. Hey, we don't like that. These were deeper in the money before. Boo, boo, Wendy, these 29 and a half's need. I want this to be buried. I want these shorts to be so far in the money",

So whoever's out there on the other side of these 29's whoever bought the 29's just chill. If you would be so kind, let me close this out and then feel free. Go haywire, go crazy, exercise till your heart's content. Just let your boy get out of this. I mean, look, hook a homie up, would you? All right. I am pretty excited.

It makes this look really, really compressed, but it's not like if we move into something that's much closer. This is a five day five minute chart just to give a different sense of magnitude. This thing has been running for some time now. So I am eager to see where it goes from here. You can see where my alerts are set to the downside where I would be reconsidering the position slash adjusting my long deltas to make sure I'm not stock holding again. It's different with options. They're decaying assets. So I can't just hold options if the market's going against me because then I'm just bleeding money everywhere. That's not the idea of believe it or not in the business. The idea is to attempt to make money. So that's what we're working towards. Maybe we'll see. As always, if there's any questions, anything you want me to take a look at, let me know be an outlier.
