And I know for some of that diehard fans, at least of the channel, they're like, yo, why are you spending so much time on game stop? And I just try to remind them that I'm learning a lot. And people that have been in markets for as long as I have, it's not as common to be able to learn a lot of brand new things. And that's literally what's happening with game stop in general is I have an opportunity to learn a lot of new things. And that's a massive part of what motivates me is learning. So that's been super, super fun. The original goal I have in my whiteboard right over here, over there, I'm holding a black pen so you can't see it. But over there pointing with the black pen, the original goal was 25,000 YouTube subs. That was the original goal. And we exceeded that a little while ago. And then we kind of resumed back with like the slow, steady growth trajectory, which has been great. Actually, fun fact in case you guys didn't know. But over the last week, I've gone through two different days where I've had massive amounts of relative massive amounts of subscribers coming off the channel, which to me looks like debt accounts being dropped.

But over the last week, I've gone through two different days where I've had massive amounts of relative massive amounts of subscribers coming off the channel, which to me looks like debt accounts being dropped. And I welcome this. The I had 78 drop off and then 83 drop off, which is hands down by far the most I've ever had unsubscribed in a day. Typically it's if there's a negative trend, it might be like three, right? Just a small channel. So seeing that actually, I'm really happy with because I don't think that's individual people going in and unsubscribing that just happened to all line up on this specific day. Right? That's not how those kinds of data points work. That looks like debt accounts being killed by YouTube. And I think that's great because one of the things that I try to do is make sure that the content that I'm making is relevant, useful, but also authentic things that come from my heart, from my passion. And hopefully, you all can feel that because if I'm spending time building stuff that I don't really care about or if I'm just trying to spend time building content for the sake of trying to grow the channel, you all know full well by now.

It's not what I do. I actively essentially move against that goal. And a great example of that is in the discord. We literally cut the discord by almost 80. I want to say that doesn't help me grow, right? It's the opposite. But I care so much more over the quality of our community, the quality of the information I present. And that's one of the things I'm hoping to really dig down on in 2025. So my goal for 2025 is 40,000 total YouTube subs. So not like 40 additional, but 40,000 total. And that would represent the highest run rate that's even including the surge that I got from stumbling into the GameStop community, which probably is about tapped out now. I would need to surpass that. So the overwhelming probability of me actually hitting that is pretty low. I would say maybe a 40 chance. But when I'm setting goals like this, that's I'm cool with that because it's going to force me to get really innovative and thoughtful on how I can try to tap into that 40 success rate.

And I hope that it's not super annoying for people that you guys can manage it because it's more, it's genuinely more important for me to maintain a free community in a free space because the thing is is if we go through a place like Reddit, Reddit is great. And you can learn a lot from Reddit. The problem with Reddit though is that most of the interaction you're going to get there is going to be exactly the kind of interaction you would expect to see. So for example, if we grab Reddit and let's just click this first one, got SMCI calls for June. Not my second purchase ever, but the one that comes before the second, I'll either learn or succeed. Hope I succeed. I hope it word it like that to avoid being auto-spammed. Right? So there will be some interactions here.

This is not what I'm interested in for our community. Again, this is not complaining or talking shit about Reddit. Reddit has its purpose. But the reason why most people go to Reddit is for anonymity. And through anonymity, you see a completely different version of people than if it's somebody that you actually know that you get to learn a little bit about, that you actually have a bit of a relationship with. Right? Like a lot of the people that have been around in the discord for a while, we actually kind of know each other for literally several years now. And we have a sense of people. That goes a long way in conversations and things like that. So I am so much more interested in fostering that kind of community because to me, that's where the gap currently sits.

So that's what I'm really focusing on is to try and continue growing our community, but not growth in terms of just numbers, growth in terms of quality of the relationships. A big thing that I'm trying to work towards is getting our community members to interact more regularly with one another without me needing to be the the starter of the conversation or the leader of the conversation. I want more and more for different of our community members to step up and to start fostering that dialogue. And I can see and it's awesome to see because that's where the beauty of a community like ours will really take hold because there's a reality of things. Again, I am one dude. I cannot spend the amount of time that I would like to spend directly interacting with each person with the level of quality that I would want because that's another thing that I refuse to let go.

And what you will notice is the more we do that is a community, the more it will take a life of its own and the better of a resource it's going to turn into for all of you.

One, again, that's four years of research later. But two more importantly, you will notice that I do my absolute best to adapt to the market. So what that means is I don't have the luxury of always doing the same thing every single year just because that's what I do the same thing or whatever this one thing is. That's just not how I trade. My ultimate objective as a trader is to do everything I can to see what the market is doing and then to try to fit with the market to take as much advantage of it as I possibly can.

And I was just like, why do I want this? Like why do I want another triple digit year? What's the purpose behind it? The money obviously is good, right? Always want to make more money. Always helpful for sure. Right. But I'm not at a spot where the difference between a 90 return and 100 return is going to make a massive difference in the next year for me. So it's not for that. So then what was it? Why why did I even think about it? Well, it's because triple digit is a pretty strong return. And it's also something that it has a clear benchmark, right? Like 100.

So let me try and say, see, you know, what I could do, what I might be able to pull out here. And then I thought about it more. And I realized that it was just a completely superficial vanity metric for me. And it didn't necessarily add any significant value to what I was doing. It didn't add a lot of purpose to what I was doing. So then I decided that if I hit it, cool, if I didn't, okay, that's fine too. And I didn't. And I didn't go out of my way to hit it. And it was essentially half a trading month for me because I was traveling for half of it. And what that means is before I travel, I have to start pairing",

A lot of a lot of changes in strategy specifically process didn't change that much. The way that I do things hasn't changed that much for a long time now. But the broader methodology definitely has. And that's what I want to spend a little time talking about once I finished consolidating all of those things. The other thing that we have to talk about quickly obviously is the paper trading challenge. So for the outlier pro members, we run, we started a paper trading challenge. I've ran these before. And we now have the 2024 results. This was just for the final quarter of 2024. And if we take a look and see where we landed, we have our C2C tab. And all of these should be completely updated.

We had members that were just trying, trying ideas. We had members that were working on specific areas of the skill set. So this overall is a very reasonable performance. We do have a couple that absolutely had runner runner negative year or quarter, I should say. And those always necessitate taking a closer look, right? And see what happened, what went wrong. The fact of the matter is is this paper trading challenge is the exact place to do that. This is the exact place to learn. That's the point of it. So we'll run through this. But so far it looks like this will be our winner. Isra. So I'll make a couple posts. And I'll talk to the Patreon folks because we did have optional pot open to for the winner.

So for this coming year, rather than paper trading from the perspective of just trying to maybe test a new strategy, test a new approach, test a new idea, what I really want the participants to do this coming year is to trade this paper trading account exactly as they intend to trade their real account. And for those that have a real account that they're going to continue trading, cool, then you could just mirror your stuff between them. If you don't have a real account, you're still paper trading. Cool. Treat this as your actual account. The reason is because we now have a full year that we're going to run this on. We're going to take quarterly snapshots as like a milestone. But we have a full year of performance in front of us.

The thought process behind it, I can look at things like trade sizing, all of those kinds of details I can look at and try to give coachable feedback. This is the best possible way, literally the best possible way to learn how to trade in my opinion. The idea of just learn by doing, this is how you learn by doing while you have a finite resource because that's the reality of trading. You have a finite resource called money. So if your approach to learn how to trade is baked around while just kind of play around with real money and see how it goes. The overwhelming probabilities, you're going to fucking lose it. The overwhelming probability. And it's just because the shit is complex, it takes a long time to figure out. So the probability that you're going to start even with a 50,000 account and just wiggle your way through and learn using real money on that 50,000 account without either entirely blowing it up or drawing it down by over 50 is about no.

I'm very confident taking that position about no. So the issue with that is you only get so many repetitions then because you only have so much money you can use. So if you can apply a true traders methodology to paper trading and take it seriously like we are here, we're literally logging our trades every freaking day. That takes effort, but you can learn so much from this process without lighting your money on fire. This is I think one of the coolest things that you have available to you from a learning perspective. And I cannot encourage everybody even if you're not in the outlier pro patreon and you're not going to be in this challenge specifically, I genuinely believe everybody should be doing this. And it's for those exact reasons. It gives you a chance to learn refine your craft without lighting money on fire that you probably don't have just light on fire.

And we have to make sure that the numbers settle where they should be. But overall looks looks pretty good. So that now leads us to the second part of the video today, which is actually to kick off 2025. We spend a little time thinking about 24, thinking both about personal growth, but also about trading. What we're trying to accomplish there, what we did accomplish there. And now it's time to take a look at 2025 and see what's coming up.

The IMF's over arching view is that global global growth will remain moderate and gradually stabilize, though downside risk process, which we can see emerging markets, particularly Asia, expected to continue growing faster than developed economies. We continue to see that trend. So I, yeah, I can understand why they would have that perspective. And there's a lot of different ways you can trade that via various ADRs and stuff like that. But I do agree that there's an opportunity there. The US economy is slower, but steady growth. Many investment banks like Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and economic think takes think forecast of the US will see slower growth compared to 2021 to 2022 with GDP expansion, possibly around 1.5 to 2. So that is pretty slow. The pace is expected to remain below historic boom levels, but generally avoids a severe downturn barring any large external shocks.

The inflation and Fed policy projections suggest inflation will continue to be moderate, but may remain above the 2 target for a while. By 25, the forecasters anticipate the Fed will have eased off the rate cycle, likely stabilizing. However, there's no consensus on the exact timing. So let's go into the stock market projections specifically. And this is looking at earnings growth first. Analysts generally see moderate earnings growth returning by 24 to 25 inflationary pressures and supply chain issues normalized, which we see. Companies with strong, this is important. Companies with strong pricing power and robust balance sheets like technology, some consumer sectors are projected to fare better than those heavily reliant on discretionary spending. This makes a ton of sense. The reason why this is so important is because those with pricing power can withstand the higher inflationary periods longer without overreliance on near-term spending at unfavorable rates and conditions. So I think that this makes a ton of sense. If interest rates remain relatively high, equity valuations could be constrained, conversely, if the Fed furthers the cuts that may boost valuations, that's kind of, you know, uh, obvious.

I think that's still been the bell of the energy and industrials benefiting from shifts in supply chains and infrastructure spending. I don't know fully about that one. Energy has been struggling hard body. So I don't know how strong I agree with that one just yet. Consumer discretionary more vulnerable to elevated inflation interest rates, but could bounce back if spending remains resilient. There's also interesting because discretionary has been outperforming staples. So I question both of those. Global I don't care so much about potential risks and certainties, geopolitical tensions, there's still a ton of shit going on. The stuff with Ukraine is going to be a big deal.

However, a mild recession in late 2425 isn't off the table. Well, clearly it's off the table for 24 to already fucking pass that. Or 25 is an off the table if consumer demand falls quickly or credit conditions tighten. So here are two big things if you weren't aware that you need to pay attention to, specifically consumer demand and credit conditions, the availability of capital. So two things to keep an eyeball as we rotate and move through 25 because if you start to see those indicators starting to fall off, again, this is literally giving you a pre-warning that things might not look great.

It's different than B13 dot or B3 dot 13 detected in dairy cows. Determine that the patient has exposure had exposure to sick and dead birds in backyard flocks. Verity cases severe H5N1 bird flu illness is not unexpected. No person, a person spread of H5 bird flu has been detected.

Yeah, well, a couple of things. Eggs. Well, first, let's see if that's actually true if there are no eggs. There are no eggs. Current egg availability in the US. Let's see. It has been experiencing an egg shortage that have decimated the supply of laying hens. In 22, we produce 92.6 billion. Even flu, this is all 22. Okay, so it looks like there are eggs. Like I don't see that there are no eggs. It looks like there's a constraint. So that's the first thing. The second thing is eggs are good, but like there are eggs. You're okay without eggs. Everybody's okay without eggs. So the main reason why I'm highlighting that is just taking this back to basic principles of assessing overall severity and impact. So it doesn't look like eggs are gone. And eggs in and of itself isn't going to necessarily cripple us in the near term. Now, if it goes on for too long, eggs are used in a lot of things. So it",

The second thing is the use of a state of emergency is specifically, it's a tactical use. You can use it for a lot of different things. So let's look at California state of emergency. And let's see. So this is six days ago. He is better lighting than I do. Proclaimed state of emergency action comes as cases were detected in dairy cows on farms in Southern California, signaling the need to further expand monitoring into build on the coordinated state wide approach to contain and mitigate the spread of the virus. To date, no person to person spread of the bird flow has been detected and nearly all infected individuals had exposure to infected cattle. They already established the largest testing and monitoring system shocker and the nation in response to the outbreak. This emergency proclamation will provide state and local agencies with additional flexibility around staffing, contracting, and other rules to support the evolving",

This emergency proclamation will provide state and local agencies with additional flexibility around staffing, contracting, and other rules to support the evolving response. So the point I'm highlighting here is that don't look at state of emergency and take it as, oh, shit's going terribly, we're all fucked. That's not what a state of emergency is. The way that state of emergency is used is for resource management. And exactly the piece here that I'm highlighting for you, it's to provide slightly better access to things and to remove some of the bureaucratic overhead to be able to access them. That's the point. I make that point because a lot of people will see state of emergency and they'll think like, oh, we're fucked. Everything's going terribly. It's an emergency. But it's just a little bit sensationalized is the main point. Jeffrey Jones, happy new year to you, my friend, welcome in. So yeah, the short is I don't think that this is a huge deal yet. That doesn't mean that it can't be a huge deal, it can be. But it's just early days and this doesn't look to be that big if it deals to me just yet. And we'll absolutely see.

Gold is done well. If we take a quick peak at gold for it's. Yeah, gold did did pretty well. And it's been basing for a while now. Notice how it had this lower low, but then it caught itself. Had this higher low, this new higher low. Gold still looks okay to me here. Now it's not doing anything impressive to the top end. But it's also. It's not doing anything poorly to the downside in terms of like falling and rolling over. 20. No, we want to be at what 24 was that? 2598. Create alert. What I'm doing is I'm getting rid of the contract specific and I'm using the normalized chart. So 2598. 98. For those that don't know when you drop it in alert, like I typically do on futures charts, it'll default to the front contract, which I don't really care about the contract. This is the consolidated graph that's going to give us all of the different contracts normalized to one another. So that's why",

Now, again, I'll run through a bigger run down, but I still have the coverage triangle running in TQs, you pro, I bet GME. And I'm actually going to reconfigure it a little bit this year so that it's not all in these leveraged tickers. The main reason for that is I want to start building part of the portfolio that I'm not cycling on as much. So I'll probably use spy for the other section of the coverage triangle. I WM has been my go-to for a long time. You all know that more volatile. So you tend to get a little bit more premium. The problem is the small caps are in a bad spot right now. So I will continue to monitor small caps if there's a decent entry and opportunity in there. I'm always here for it. But I try to remind you all of this as much as I can.

So if we look at it on the year, it's ran essentially started here at 199 to 220. Had a 20 point move all year. It's again, not an awful year, but that's not a great year either. That's a pretty inside year. I don't really love that. Now another interesting thing though is when we look at spy, spy on the year had a really solid year. It started off at 427 ish. So really, really solid. Now the problem though is if we take a look at equal weighted spy, which is RSP, it had a good year, but not as good of a year. So this started around like 160 ish, 157, and it ended at 175. So a really good year, but the equal weight is showing still a pretty heavy dependence on a handful of names, which again, that's nothing new.

The fact that it's now 2025 versus 2024 literally makes no difference. I trade the market off of what it's been doing. So I know some people really like the idea of like coming in with like an annual overview or like an annual what to expect in 2025. Here's the facts. I don't know, fucking idea what to expect. I have no idea what's going to happen over the next year. I have no clue. We could have a bird flu right now that's super mellow and doesn't really do anything, or we can have a bird flu that gets super aggressive and starts torching things, right? Like that's why I don't care to come up with really specific things. Now I do like to think through what general themes do I expect to exist? And there are a handful of those themes. One of those themes is inflation. We still are hypersensitive to inflation. inflation level data in the economy.

And again, we don't know what's of those it's looking like yet. It's leaning a little more soft as it sits, but it's too early to tell. We just don't know. So that's one of the themes that I'm absolutely keeping in mind for 25. Another theme that I think is pertinent is technology. Where do we think technology sets in terms of market dominance? Do we think technology is going to be the next leader for the year? And I personally do. I don't see a reason why that would change in the near term until conditions start to meaningfully change. And I just haven't seen the condition for that changing yet. I just haven't seen it yet. So one of the things I try to think about with respect to technology is that it has the ability to have an outsized impact relative to its cost. And there's not a lot of other industries that can do that. So what I mean by that is let's say an oil and gas that you really wanted to start crushing it in oil and gas.

Technology is the accelerator that just about every industry is leaning on in order to continue to evolve and accelerate. I just don't see that changing just yet. But again, even though I don't see that changing just yet, that doesn't mean it won't. This is the nature of Bayesian analysis. I conduct the analysis based on everything that's available to me today. And I come up with my best assumptions today. And then tomorrow, if some shit changes, it changes. And I update my mental models. Because one of the mistakes I think people say get into is they'll be like, okay, I think this is going to be the case for 2025. Let me position my whole portfolio. And again, if you're an investor, fine, you're playing longer term themes anyway. But as a trader, to try and position a portfolio off of an annual level expectation, I think is a fool's errand.

It did that in the first half of the year. If you got into Nvidia after this massive run up, you have just about nothing to show for it for the second half of the year. It didn't do much. So what I'm trying to highlight to you is that this is still a completely fine trade, no problem. But from a trader's perspective, my job is to try and capture this move. And then when this starts happening, to go to something else that is showing a move that I can monetize. Because you can monetize this for sure. You can trade your strangles. You can still trade this. I'm actually going to open up a new covered strangle in here. So I'm not saying Nvidia is bad. I like Nvidia long term.

Meta has been doing a little bit better. And Meta is also starting to move into other things that I think will continue to give it a pretty solid position. And that's one of the beautiful things of finding your way into something like spy is if we take a look at what its holdings are, I was trying to figure out what this was telling me, you're essentially getting pretty decent exposure to some of these top companies. Now it's still just grossly over waited for the top three Apple and video Microsoft. I mean, just grossly overweight. But it still continues to do pretty well in that with the waiting on the list in terms of its performance. So tech, I still think is the the place to be.

I'm very eager to see what the IPO world looks like in 2025 because it definitely slowed down quite a lot. So it would be nice to see IPOs pick up a little bit and just to see some new names entering onto the market and moving things through. Let me take a look really quick. I don't know what the total IPOs were for 2024. But let's see if Chachi Petinos. I have to log in on that. Perfect. What were the total number of IPOs in 2022? Let's see. In 2024, the global market witnessed the notable increase in IPOs in the US. There were 224 raising approximately 29.6 billion of 50 increase over 23, which 23 was also really, really slow. Let's see if there's a chart. Let's do US IPO chart. Why chart probably has some? Yeah, there we go. So 225 here, pretty strong on a relative basis. 21 was crazy. Absolutely crazy.

Do we continue on the growth phase? Or do we start to slow down? And I don't know the answer yet. We will soon find out. I presume. Tommy says, what about using XOK and CS get more exposure to the tech high flyers? Yeah, that could be done for sure. I mean, it's not what I'm doing. The reason why I'm not doing that is because I'm still going to maintain the leveraged components. So I'm still going to use T triple Qs and Upro. But the tech itself, the tech element of SP is still the dominant force of it. So even though it has other stuff in it, the other stuff is at such low percentages that you're still primarily getting tech. Now, Qs is even stronger still as a distribution of the percentage of the fund, but it's still heavily, heavily tech for sure.

I think that he's not going to be interested in trying to like slap them on all at once because that would provide just such an insane shock to things. But I do think that he's serious about it because he's trying to use it as a bargaining chip. And the only way that he can use it as a bargaining chip is if he's willing to follow through on aspects of it. So I do think he's serious. And I think that you'll see a series of effects specifically depending on how they are implemented. That's the biggest component of this, how they're actually implemented. Because if, for example, like China, if we start really, really aggressive with China, that can stir up a pretty big pot of back and forth that will impact a lot of the market, a lot, the market.

Well, one of the big things he's trying to do with the tariffs is move more business to the United States. He's trying to get more of our companies to produce domestically. Well, if you throw on massive tariffs all at one super fast, you don't actually further that objective. You don't. Because they just start incurring massive losses, which I don't think really help to that objective. Now, if he comes in too light, meaning not serious enough, well, that's a problem because then they don't take it seriously, and they don't really care to move. So that's a separate issue. But I think that, I think that issue is a little more navigable personally. Because if you have the tariffs, they know that they're going to come, you roll them out slowly. I think it starts to move the behavior in the direction that we want. At least in terms of domestic production. And the reason why I say the direction that we want is because domestic production helps us quite a lot as a country, because we're not stuck",

And the reason why I say the direction that we want is because domestic production helps us quite a lot as a country, because we're not stuck in some of the nasty scenarios we found ourselves with in terms of external production. You're essentially at somebody else's mercy that you can't control, which again is difficult to manage, I think. So it works while things are working and things are nice. But if we have stuff that, let's say, for example, from a military perspective, and we have a bunch of stuff that we rely on that's produced in China, and then the engagements with China start to heat up that just becomes a massive weakness. So it'll be a bit of a balancing act. Dan says that's relative to you, CDJ. I didn't see. Okay. CJ says, is 500 shares considered a medium size position for when Moas comes? Well, what is that? Yeah. Actually, Dan, what a great what a great response. What is that CDJ? What do you mean? Like, what does that mean to you? Because exactly as Dan is highlighting, it is a entirely, entirely relevant or relative, sorry, not relevant. I'm placing my dinner order in an entirely relative perspective.

I'll just do a video right after this. So I did start a coverage strangle in GameStop. I already had like the existing position. So what I did is I use some of my existing position and I ported over like a medium level cost basis because I have a much better basis than what I'm going to use. But I want to pick something that's more relevant to people. CDJ says, what would you consider a medium size position on GME for you? I would say a medium size position would be like 30 of an account, 30 to 40 of an account. That would be like medium. So if you have a million bucks, like three, four hundred thousand dollars, don't like that. But yeah. The note though on that CDJ, at least my recommendation is don't worry about labels. Don't worry about like what medium is or isn't. Don't worry if it's called medium, venti or whatever the other term Starbucks uses. Just whatever it is, make it make sense for whatever you think is going to happen and whatever you are",

So the other quick update for you all, the daily live streams we should be back on a normal schedule, we actually might be running out to the desert for a few days. So they might get a little screwy for the rest of this week, but next week we should be back on standard fare. And then for the Sunday and Wednesday streams, I will do two. The first one will be about a half hour on the regular YouTube channel, just updating the market broadly. And then we'll do the pro live streams for the second half hour after that to run through more specific stuff. Go through individual positions, answer individual questions for people kind of work through more more detailed scenarios. That's the idea. It's been a little time getting a bit deeper. And then the other thing I'm going to do is soon I'm going to open up a submission for people that are interested in participating for the outlier options trading bootcamp. Completely free.

And it's a series that I do a couple times during the year. So what it is is I work with people on a weekly basis and we essentially make videos working through the trading skill set. Now the goal for this is for it to be more at an intermediate level. So it's not going to be straight for beginners. It's going to be an intermediate level of content. We're not going to go over our options basics. There's actually going to be a quiz in order to join the thing. And that's not to be mean or anything. It's so that I can just make sure I'm getting in the right level of person so that the content can be what I want it to be. So that'll be coming up. But those will be I don't know if they're going to be live stream or dropped is recording on Fridays. But until then Fridays will continue to be options trading basics.

So it's at least palatable. But I'm still targeting at least two podcasts per week. So I have a podcast. They generally drop around Wednesday, but it's kind of fluid. It depends on when I record with the person. And then the main channel videos will be out on Sundays now instead of Saturdays. So we'll run those on Sundays for a little bit. And then I might actually push them to Monday just so that the weekend's a little more open for stuff. So we have a ton of content. So you literally will have a live stream pretty much every single day. Saturday will still be game stop for now. Sunday's market prep Monday is market recap Tuesday. Just kicking it hanging out Wednesday will be like a market update Thursday, trader hanging out, kicking it Friday will be options trading for beginners Saturday, game stop. Those are all the live streams. And then we'll still have the weekly video come out on Sunday. And then I'll still probably drop one to two other videos throughout the week that are just kind of temporally related. About stuff. So that's what's coming up. As always, if you guys",
