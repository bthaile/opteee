    "text": "earnings are always a ventful. Today I just took a 250 loss in dash. Guess what? Sometimes that happens. That's part of the trading game and despite all of the bullshit that you'll see out there about, apparently nobody has losing trades. It's not really how it goes. What matters is that the broad system still makes money and so far I'm still up on the weak. Which guess what? I had a big knockback today from that earnings play. It happens. But as long as the system continues to perform in his positively expected, that's what I care about. Not that every single trade works out, because it's not gonna be an outlier seal later.",
