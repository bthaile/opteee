    "text": "This right above my head shows you why you need to immediately stop over emphasizing your wind rate as an option straighter because ultimately it doesn't matter by itself. It's simply the piece of a way more important equation called your expected return or expectancy. Let's take a look. Here I'm giving you a sample trading strategy where you have 95 winning trades and your average winning trade is 15 bucks. You have just five losing trades. This represents a 95 win rate, but those losing trades on average lose you two hundred ninety bucks. Your expected return on this strategy that has a 95 win rate is negative. That means if you do this long term, you will lose money despite the fact that you have a 95 win rate. You have to focus on this number, not this number, being all yours, yell at her.",
