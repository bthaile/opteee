    "text": "what's up outliers today's video is all about GameStop because we had a couple things happen today I will do the standard market update later today during the options trading for beginners Workshop but uh yeah there was just a couple things in here that I think we need to spend a few minutes looking at and for those interested tomorrow 00 P p.m. Pacific Time still have the standardized GameStop live stream the game plan actually was to look through roaring Kitty old trades so this seems to in line with it so what's going on today well at there's two time frames that I think are most important the first thing is I got an alert and these are Pacific time but I got an alert at 42 that there were some really massive siiz trades that came through in GameStop so there is 6,399 of the 22 and A2 calls expiring 13 sep the spot price at these at the time was bck 75 got in there for 1.12 mil and then right below that essentially a second off so I would absolutely consider these to be the same trade there was 3660 of the 22 a half calls same expiration for 169 giggity for 69,000 bucks so this takes us over 10,000 contracts essentially and there's some just really really really really interesting Behavior going on here so 0842 37 and 38 that's when these trades come through then we take a look at roran Kitty's",
