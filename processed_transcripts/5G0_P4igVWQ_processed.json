This is talking about this price action. And I know everybody that follows GameStop, especially the diehards, we kind of look at it and we just dismissively say, well, the price is fake, you know, the head user's just trying to put it into the dirt. And then we just kind of write it off as that. And I don't blame you. But again, my entire message and my entire purpose of doing these kinds of things is try to offer a slightly different perspective. And it's not, I'm not saying that that's not happening. But what I am saying is I don't think that's just what's happening. I think that there's a mix of forces at play here. And I do think that it exhibits some level of standard market forces. But then obviously it has a lot of injections that don't follow standard market forces. The reason why that differentiation is really important is because as we're analyzing the stock, we have to keep that in mind. Because what I typically tell people is like, well, if that is we say the hegey's wanted it into the dirt, then why isn't it in the dirt? Right? Like we say that they're all",

We say that they essentially control the price. If that is fully the case, why isn't it lower? Right? We're saying that's what they want. So why isn't it? So again, that's not to say that that's not happening. I think we, as we go through the DD library, there's literally clear evidence that it's happening to a degree. But the broader point I'm trying to make is that it's not all that's happening. There are other participants in the stock, like you and I and other people and other institutions that aren't inherently trying to sell or box something down into the dirt manipulate the price, those kinds of things. And they enter the equation. Now, who's the dominant force? It's a great question. What I can tell you, the dominant force isn't is the hedge funds. And I know that probably surprises a lot of people, people when, like when I say something like that, people will probably say, well, how could you possibly say that?

The reason why I say that is because if we think about hedge funds being short, they don't want this. An entity that supremely short something like GameStop would not want the stock, especially if they're short down here at 15, they don't want the stock up at 65. So there's an effect that starts to take the thing out of their hands to a degree. Then there's the structural re intervention. And whether we think that's inclusion with the hedge funds, the market structure, you know, writ large, whatever, but there is another inject that then stifles this and stops it. But why if hedge funds fully control the price themselves, why even go through this? It shows that they're not fully in control. And it's important again for us to acknowledge that fact that there are areas that they are forced out of control because from a hedge funds perspective, as we typically think, if they just want to drive it down to zero, why wouldn't they just do that? They're not. They can't. And it's because there are other factors here. So that's a good thing, actually, in my opinion. Also a good thing is you guys can't probably see it.

I don't know if you can see that little rubber band on the tip of my finger. I'm kind of like a very simple person.

And if you take a look at the volume node that's being built here, there are again, lots of people willing to transact at this price handle. And again, I'll just reiterate quickly from the last stream that we did, there hasn't been a fundamental underlying change in GameStop to really even loosely cover what this is, meaning this drop, whatever this was. So because of that fact, and because we continue to see a lot of people transacting in here, this to me is still the area to beat specifically to the upside to the downside. I think the floor is starting to be generally priced in again, at least in terms of what information is currently available, available to us today right now. That doesn't mean that that's always going to be what the case is. But right now, this seems like the general zone it's looking to be in. We can see that there's a general floor being priced in.

How do the next couple days fare against this broader descending trend as we continue to bump up against this floor? So there's one other effect to be aware of from a broader technical analysis perspective. Is as we have descending channels like this, the more times that the stock will break out of the descending channel, the less strong that general direction becomes and obviously we move in favor of a consolidation. So it's broken out of the descending channel once and it's essentially going to have to make a choice on it sometime next week again. So next week will be, I think, an important an important week. Now, if it does again, start breaking to the downside to anybody's game. It really is. It's really hard to tell because what I can tell you is that there is nobody transacting in here. I have a hard time thinking that the stock would traverse this entire space. It just seems unlikely to me, but just because it seems unlikely doesn't mean it's not doable or not possible.

That is by design. The reason I'm doing that is because of this is going down. I don't want to buy shares right now. I want to wait until it starts to level off. Now the reason why I had bought shares on the 30th is because it looked like after this breakdown day on the 29th when it broke out of this consolidation or I'm sorry out of the down trend into consolidation and it gapped up a little bit started showing strength. It looked like we were going to start appreciating but also notice how little I bought about 50 shares. And that's just like a prospecting position. The reason why is because the overall stock component of the trade was too light for what I wanted. But I also am I don't want to call it smart enough because I'm really not that smart. But I'm experienced enough at this point to know that entering too aggressively at that point, meaning here when the stock was up at I'll show you when the stock was up here is I know better.

And the reason why I know better is because I know that that's a very tentative spot for a stock after it just comes out of a downside consolidation. It's not yet broke up above local highs. So it's a prospecting position. It's putting on a little bit of a trade to build up the stock position just a little bit. But there's a reason why I prefer to remain primarily in the short puts. The reason why I'm remaining in the short puts is twofold. The first one is because I have a much better basis that I can work off of. So if these continue to go unassigned, what I will do is start to split this. And I'll trade something like a six lot. I will have three lots further out 30 delta something like that. And then I'll have three lots that are actually closer to spot price to start trying to pick up some more shares. The stock needs to consolidate before I do that. Buying stock as it's going down is not good business for a trader. Now I emphasize that point heavily because from an investor's perspective, it's kind of whatever you want it to be, right? But from a trader's perspective, it's not from a trader's perspective, I'm here to make money. So that's why the positioning is the",

But from a trader's perspective, it's not from a trader's perspective, I'm here to make money. So that's why the positioning is the way it is. The other reason, the second reason, as I told you, there's two for this is because volatility right now is still high on the put side. And the reason why volatility is high on the put side is because of the drop. As stocks tend to drop, you will typically see an expansion in put side volatility because people will be buying puts to hedge to the downside. So I am selling them that risk. And I'm taking the risk on for them essentially because I don't mind holding the stock obviously, but I'm going to collect a premium in excess of what the otherwise normalized volatility should be on these puts. So all of that word stuff comes down to these are relatively expensive for what they are. So I sold them. It sums it up. Okay. So now let's take a look at the options chain. And we have a bit of an offload on the call side. So we're at 513 against 165. So still really heavy calls to you, but also quite a bit lighter than what it was before on a relative basis.

So still really heavy calls to you, but also quite a bit lighter than what it was before on a relative basis. From a volume perspective, there was a lot of volume being pushed out into this next front expiration. So if we take a quick peak at open interest, and then if we take a quick peak at this upcoming week, it's 7,8,000 calls against 12,000 puts. So heavy, but not crazy. The next biggest expiration still is 21 Feb. And then anything close to that, not really. Yeah, not really. The only other two is the March and the April. Oh, no, I'm sorry. Was it April and June? Yeah, April and June, my bad. April and June are both over 100,000. The other one is just 21 Feb. So quiet. That's all that boils down to the option chain isn't exceedingly busy right now. So that's that. All right. So what I want to do now before we get into the DD library and all that is I actually want to poke through. I'm sure it'll be on X somewhere, but I just want to look up Ryan Cohen and the change that he made so that we can do a little bit of homework. Ryan, Owen, I'm sure that there will be no. No. Okay.

And then he got upset and he was like pissed off again for the stoppage. And it's just surprising at this point because it's like, dude, just don't. If you stop getting knocked down, then they're less inclined to stop the fight. But you're in these like super compromised positions. Anyways, I still respect a ton of respect for Izzy. By the way, he's a fantastic striker. But yeah, you got to knock the fuck out. So this leads me to believe that people think by making the switch, it now means they're going to have to deliver the shares. This is hilarious, by the way. Now, okay, here's the next. Why do we think this? This is this really infuses me. So why do we think that they're struggling to find the 36 million shares given the recent offerings? I don't understand that. I don't think the shares are really that scarce anymore. I'm just trying to see if there's anything else. A merger and acquisition. Moves 36 million GMI shares to Canada",

So I don't think that's that because the dude's also super fucking rich. You may have planned to use RC ventures for other investments or wind it down after fulfilling its initial purpose in an activist campaign. I doubt that if I'm not mistaken RC ventures probably been around for a while. I don't know that either, but I'm just speculating. Direct ownership can appear more transparent from the perspective of other shareholders in the market at large. This is funny reinforcing Cohen's commitment to GameStop's turn around. So this already did all the research on fucking GameStop and the context and its bringing all of those elements into this response, which is really impressive to me. As chairman Cohen is subject to ongoing disclosure obligations, sometimes having shares in a personal account makes reporting a compliance more straightforward than holding them through layers of an LLCs. That could be a thing. Corporations often prefer direct ownership with the principal shareholder rather than intermediate entity can simplify communications about voting and stuff maybe, but since he's so involved, I doubt it.

Some of the original legacy for holding the shares and RC ventures may no longer be needed. So I think chat GPT seems to continually lean towards this efficiency concept. And I actually don't think it's about like decreasing administrative overhead. I just don't see that because he's more than capable of doing it and he has this stuff in place. Okay, here we go. The tax conversation. Canadian versus US tax rules since Cohen is Canadian, the interplay of US corporate tax law, state, Delaware and Canadian tax law can get complicated. Depending on his personal tax planning, it might be more favorable to hold GME shared directly rather than through a US LLC. So it could be something between the interplay between Canadian citizenship and the domestic holding. Does Cohen have kids? Is Ryan Cohen have kids? Do you guys know?

This says no, he doesn't have any children. This says they have a son. This says they have two kids. This says there's no kids. Okay, well, the key takeaway is that he may or may not have kids. Anyways, this, like this, I would assume that would be his kid, but I don't fucking know that could be AI generated. I don't know his family. Anyways, the reason I'm asking is because it says that there could be an estate planning component to it. But yeah. So anyways, after going through like even this general overview with GPT-01, it doesn't look like there's like some sort of clear thing we can point that. That Lauren says I'm glad his kids can't be Googled for real though. Yeah, that is it's better for them for sure. So I guess the way to think about it here is there's no no. Since there's no definitive answer, it's unlikely that it's like for this very hyper-specific reason that people can cleanly point towards. Now let's ask it the other question though.

So when Cohen, when RC moved his shares, does that force, I want to see the exact terms people are using? So this is divorce. I don't think that's correct. Believe in it doesn't matter.

Let's just see if we can figure out. Does that force the corresponding shares to be located and delivered? Good disk cause some sort of port squeeze. Or is there enough availability of shares that this might not be in issue? In general, when an investor transfers shares from one account to another to from an LLC to their personal name, it does not automatically force a broker anyone else to locate and deliver shares in a way that would trigger short squeeze. The move typically happens at an internal book entry at the brokerage or custodian level.

And what I mean by surge average volume is we can clearly see that there are periods where volume really starts to pick up heavy. And this is during periods when short covering starts to jack up. Right, so you can see that the stock can handle much more average volume. So if we go here, the five day average volume is 139 against 46.7. So let's just take the midpoint, 139 million. 46.7. The average between those is 92.850. 92.50. So then if we do the math using that surge volume, it's like three days. So the main point here is that the stock can absolutely handle pretty significant expansion in volume. So all of this is to go back to the idea and the current, my current hypothesis is that it doesn't look like the conditions for a short squeeze are massive right now.

Now there is monthly disclosures to SEC institutional managers meeting certain thresholds would report short positions and certain short selling activity monthly on a new form. The position level data would be submitted confidentially to the SEC not immediately disclosed to the public at the manager level aggregate public disclosure after a time delay that SEC would publish aggregated short sale data by issuer. But without revealing the identity of each manager specific position that's good. They should do that. Fresh holds the proposal included specific thresholds to determine which managers have to file. Typically it targets managers ready subject to 13 F reporting so 100 million plus and 13 F securities. Okay. So now let's see what happens if they don't do it. What are the penalties if the entity doesn't comply and disclose? Let's see. Civil enforcement actions is probably just fucking fines man. Yeah, it looks like the main thing is they're talking about the fines. And Russ says and who are the non reporting entities it looks like non reporting and well let me ask. What would be considered the non reporting entity? My expectation is what we talked about funds that aren't over that threshold of 100 mil. Non so private companies. So a company that has not registered investment managers below the thresholds. Entities not subject to exchange act regulation or SEC requirements so they wouldn't comply with anything else.

Super fun analysis by the way really really enjoyed that but let's now get into actually analyzing the DD I just got to update our timestamps.

Russ says as Gets you PT if they're exempt from well yeah the reason why market makers would be exempt from it that makes sense is because again the short shares that a market maker would hold from a theoretical perspective is not to take a directional bet on the stock. If we think of the entities that are trying to push price down it's typically institutions that then are in collusion with other supporting entities but it's external entities because as always market makers are going to be slaved to order flow. What order flow is they have to make markets. So the short positions conceivably that they maintain then therefore would be not out of a directional bias but out of managing inventory. So yeah I actually don't think that there's a big issue with them doing that. I think the big issue with market makers is the the game that they play with kicking the can around that I think is bullshit but that's because they're trying to avoid going out and actually buying shares when shares were scarce. I'm not so certain that that's is big of a deal as much now anyways thankfully. All right. So we were going through this AMA with Lucy we had done a bunch of work and then we came across. We came across a lot of research but specifically that documentary was really cool. I enjoyed looking at that quite a lot that's another one",

I'm going to get our dinner order out of here so that we can stuff our faces. Gab says what if their hedge fund has a directional bias? Well that's starts to open the pure conflict of interest but even if their hedge fund has a directional bias they still are they still are slave to order flow. They can't stop taking order flow because they actually have a requirement to keep their quote machines on otherwise they start to lose different classification and designations. So there is to be clear a massive conflict of interest. I'm not an advocate at all of Citadel having a hedge fund arm and market making arm like I think that that's incestuous. However that being said it's not like the Citadel market makers can just again like move the price wherever they want it to be because Citadel as an institution might have a specific position in GameStop.

The problem the problem with trying to draw the comparison we do this in the states with a lot of stuff and rightfully so it's okay to make comparisons but the context of the comparisons are really important so trying to make a comparison between like the US stock market against any European market or even South Korea it's you can compare them but we need to maintain the context these are tiny tiny markets so the entire operation of the markets on a relative basis is just it's completely different it's not even close it's completely different.
