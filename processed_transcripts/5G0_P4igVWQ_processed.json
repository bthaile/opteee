And I know everybody that follows game stop, especially the diehards, we kind of look at it and we just dismissively say, well, the price is fake, the head users are just trying to put it into the dirt and then we just kind of write it off as that. And I don't blame you. But again, my entire message and my entire purpose of doing these kinds of things is try to offer a slightly different perspective. And it's not, I'm not saying that that's not happening. But what I am saying is I don't think that's just what's happening. I think that there's a mix of forces at play here. And I do think that it exhibits some level of standard market forces, but then obviously it has a lot of injections that don't follow standard market forces. The reason why that differentiation is really important is because as we're analyzing the stock, we have to keep that in mind. Because what I typically tell people is like, well, if we say the hedges wanted it into the dirt, then why isn't it in the dirt? Like we say that they're all powerful. We say that they essentially control the price. If that is fully the case, why isn't it lower? We're saying that's what they want,",

If that is fully the case, why isn't it lower? We're saying that's what they want, so why isn't it? So again, that's not to say that that's not happening. I think we, as we go through the DD library, there's literally clear evidence that it's happening to a degree. But the broader point I'm trying to make is that it's not all that's happening. There are other participants in the stock, like you and I and other people and other institutions that aren't inherently trying to sell or box something down into the dirt manipulate the price, those kinds of things, and they enter the equation. Now, who's the dominant force? It's a great question. What I can tell you the dominant force isn't is the hedge funds. And I know that probably surprises a lot of people. People, when I say something like that, people will probably say, well, how could you possibly say that? The reason why I say that is because if we think about hedge funds being short, they don't want this. An entity that supremely short something like GameStop would not want the stock, especially if they're short down here at 15, they don't want the stock up at 65. So there's an effect that starts to take the thing",

So there's an effect that starts to take the thing out of their hands to a degree. Then there's the structural re-intervention. And whether we think that's inclusion with the hedge funds, the market structure, you know, writ large, whatever, but there is another inject that then stifles this and stops it. But why if hedge funds fully control the price themselves, why even go through this? It shows that they're not fully in control. And it's important, again, for us to acknowledge that fact, that there are areas that they are forced out of control. Because from a hedge funds perspective, as we typically think, if they just want to drive it down to zero, why wouldn't they just do that? They're not. They can't. And it's because there are other factors here. So that's a good thing, actually, in my opinion. Also a good thing is you guys can't probably see it. I don't know if you can see that little rubber band on the tip of my finger. I'm kind of like a very simple person, but I got this when I bought a new hard drive to put stuff on my TV for my life.

So as you see me here playing with this, that's what I'm doing just so that you know it's up like this is fun to do. Pretty sure I'm on the spectrum, but I enjoy this. So back to the stock, back to where we are current day. So now we have a slightly new picture to pay attention to. I'll clear out. I don't want to clear this out to be honest. I kind of want to keep these. I'm just really, really interested in these value areas. Yeah, man. What do I do?

And if you take a look at the volume node that's being built here, there are again, lots of people willing to transact at this price handle. And again, I'll just reiterate quickly from the last stream that we did, there hasn't been a fundamental underlying change in GameStop to really even loosely cover what this is, meaning this drop, whatever this was. So because of that fact, and because we continue to see a lot of people transacting in here, this to me is still the area to beat, specifically to the upside. To the downside, I think the floor is starting to be generally priced in. Again, at least in terms of what information is currently available, as available to us today right now. That doesn't mean that that's always going to be what the case is. But right now, this seems like the general zone it's looking to be in. We can see that there's a general floor being priced in. This is now the big question. How does the next couple days fare? How do the next couple days fare against this broader descending trend as we continue to bump up against this floor? So there's one other effect to be aware of from a broader technical analysis perspective. Is as we have descending channels like this, the more times that the stock will",

So there's one other effect to be aware of from a broader technical analysis perspective. Is as we have descending channels like this, the more times that the stock will break out of the descending channel, the less strong that general direction becomes. And obviously we move in favor of a consolidation. So it's broken out of the descending channel once. And it's essentially going to have to make a choice on it sometime next week again. So next week will be, I think, an important, an important week. Now, if it does, again, start breaking to the downside, is anybody's game really is it's really hard to tell because what I can tell you is that there is nobody transacting in here. I have a hard time thinking that the stock would traverse this entire space. It just seems unlikely to me, but just because it seems unlikely, doesn't mean it's not doable or not possible. So I would write that as possible, seemingly unlikely. Now from an options perspective, let me move you guys over here. I think we have, yeah, there we go. So this is the latest coverage strangle update. And funny enough, I think right after Wednesday, what was Wednesday, the 29th, right? Yeah, the 29th.

And then, you know, as fate would have it literally the day after I ended up making changes to the position. And that's just from managing the trade as it sits. So I won't belabor anything in here. You guys can all see kind of what's going on. The main notes to take away is I did add a little bit of shares. And I adjusted the short puts and the short calls. None of them were in the money. They all came down at a profit. That's a, yeah, this is still a profit. It's just the coloring on this is wrong for whatever reason. So that's, that's all there is to this one. So right now the game stop position in the, this part of the portfolio is 250 shares at 2821. So we're utilizing 19,500 bucks. Only 28 of that is in the stock. 50 of that is in cash secured puts.

Or I'm sorry, out of the downtrend into consolidation. And it gapped up a little bit, started showing strength. It looked like we were going to start appreciating. But also notice how little I bought about 50 shares. And that's just like a prospecting position. The reason why is because the overall stock component of the trade was too light for what I wanted. But I also am, I don't want to call it smart enough because I'm really not that smart. But I'm experienced enough at this point to know that entering too aggressively at that point, meaning here, when the stock was up at, I'll show you, when the stock was up here is, I know better. And the reason why I know better is because I know that that's a very tentative spot for a stock. After it just comes out of a downside consolidation, it's not yet broke up above local highs.

So I'm going to use a reason why I prefer to remain primarily in the short puts. The reason why I'm remaining in the short puts is twofold. The first one is because I have a much better basis that I can work off of. So if these continue to go unassigned, what I will do is start to split this and I'll trade something like a six lot. I will have three lots further out, 30 delta, something like that. And then I'll have three lots that are actually closer to spot price to start trying to pick up some more shares. The stock needs to consolidate before I do that. Buying stock as it's going down is not good business for a trader. Now I emphasize that point heavily because from an investor's perspective, it's kind of whatever you want it to be, right? But from a trader's perspective, it's not. From a trader's perspective, I'm here to make money. So that's why the positioning is the way it is.

The other reason, the second reason, as I told you, there's two for this is because volatility right now is still high on the put side. And the reason why volatility is high on the put side is because of the drop. As stocks tend to drop, you will typically see an expansion in put side volatility because people will be buying puts to hedge to the downside. So I am selling them that risk. And I'm taking the risk on for them essentially because I don't mind holding the stock obviously, but I'm going to collect a premium in excess of what the otherwise normalized volatility should be on these puts. So all of that word stuff comes down to these are relatively expensive for what they are. So I sold them. It sums it up. Okay. So now let's take a look at the options chain. And we have a bit of an offload on the call side. So we're at 513 against 165. So still really heavy calls you, but also quite a bit lighter than what it was before on a relative basis from a volume perspective.

So it was from RC ventures in Delaware. Okay. From his entity, RC ventures based out of Delaware into his personal name. Where this where he is a Canadian citizen. First let's see that. I'm not giving it all the excess details of GameStop being like a really heavily shorted stock and you know all the ideas. So let's, while that's reasoning through that, let's talk about it, right? Let's, let's reason through it. So Zach says, do you think Cohen converted shares due to his divorce? I don't think, I don't think so because in the divorce, I didn't know he was going through divorce and I actually have no idea where he would be. Is he? Well, first, yeah, actually, coffee and donuts, that's a great question. I just kind of took it as truth since somebody brought it up. But like, is he getting divorced? Do we know that? I think that's a, then is a good starting point actually. Okay. Well, anyways, whether he is or isn't anything beyond that, I mean, we could look it up. But I don't think, I don't think there's any ish with that because if he puts it in his personal name, I feel like that just makes him more susceptible than anything. Lauren says, I'm not sure in",

I was also learning there is that dude from the documentary we were watching, one of those attorneys and somebody was saying that like he was just kind of scrolling people over, which is also really interesting. Coffee says, isn't Florida state to hide your money of getting divorced? Can Griffen move there? Well, they probably move there for taxes. The most people go to Florida for the tax treatment. Delaware is actually a really, really friendly, well, privacy friendly state to come up with and to base your entities out of. So a lot of people will use Delaware for that reason. But for people moving to Florida, the majority is for tax and to try to offload some of their, their tax burden, which. Kambler, shit's expensive. Gab says it wasn't West who screwed over people.

It says the shift could involve tax regulatory or compliance or something else entirely. They might involve personal control voting rights, tax planning, regulatory issues or organizational restructuring, speculation on his strategy or future plans could be a factor to. He may have transferred the shares for personal tax or corporate structure reasons preparing for a Canadian move. Is he, is he already in Canada? I don't know, or organizational changes, speculation is abundant, but no official statement exists. A Collins SEC form for details could hint at a personal preference reorganizing to avoid LLC maintenance. I can't imagine that. Collins reasons for transferring shares could involve tax exposure reduction preparation for a corporate action like, ah, interesting. This one actually is slightly interesting. So Collins reasons for transferring shares could involve tax exposure reduction, which I can't imagine that being the case because LLCs are passed through entities anyways.

We have to ask more about that one because I don't know the, I don't know how that works, but I want to know without knowing him the transfer shares seems likely due to personal financial gains, estate planning or preparation for corporate transaction or reorganization. All right. So let's explain that. And you expand on the transfer and relation, chip to corporate, structure reasons. Let's see why that might be. Brad says it could be from M and A. It's easier if it's in your personal name for some reason. I don't know if that's true, to be honest, because again, depending on who, who and what holds RC ventures LLC, which I imagine would be RC, maybe somebody else of his choosing, you don't, it can just be you.

But it says actress investors or major shareholders often set up special purpose LLCs are holding companies like RC ventures to accumulate shares and target company. Now, LLC can help manage risk, isolate liabilities, consolidate funding for multiple partners that are once Ryan Cohen became more formally involved with GameStop joined the board became chairman influence corporate strategy. Also interesting said I didn't tell GPT any of that. So it's I'm highlighting that there's actually some pretty good accuracies in this reasoning because normally I don't trust it. It may no longer have been necessary or cost effective to maintain a separate holding vehicle solely for GME shares, not that expensive to maintain an LLC.

I doubt that if I'm not mistaken, RC ventures probably been around for a while. I don't know that either, but I'm just speculating. Um, direct direct ownership can appear more transparent from the perspective of other shareholders in the market at large. This is funny reinforcing Cohen's commitment to GameStop's turnaround. So this already did all the research on fucking GameStop and the context and its bringing all of those elements into this response, which is really impressive to me. As chairman Cohen is subject to ongoing disclosure obligations, sometimes having shares in a personal account makes reporting and compliance more straightforward, then holding them through layers of an LLCs that could be that could be a thing. Corporations often prefer direct ownership with the principal shareholder rather than intermediate entity can simplify communications about voting and stuff maybe, but since he's so involved, I doubt it. When Cohen was purely an activist investor, it made sense to aggregate shares in a holding LLC that could lead a proxy fight if necessary after securing board representation and stepping into the chairman role.

And I actually don't think it's about like decreasing administrative overhead. I just don't see that because he's more than capable of doing it and he has this stuff in place. Okay, here we go. The tax conversation. Canadian versus US tax rules since Cohen is Canadian, the interplay of US corporate tax law, state, Delaware, and Canadian tax law can get complicated. Depending on his personal tax planning, it might be more favorable to hold GME shared directly rather than through a US LLC. So it could be something between the interplay between Canadian citizen citizenship and the domestic holding. Does Cohen have kids? Does Ryan Cohen have kids? Do you guys know? A coffee says safer to have shares in Canada if the market crashes, I don't think so. It's the shares would be on the same exchanges. It would be what it would be. Do you guys know if he has kids?

Does that force the corresponding shares to be located and delivered? Good disk. Cause some sort of short squeeze. Or is there enough availability of shares that this might not be initially? In general, when an investor transfers shares from one account to another to from an LLC to their personal name, it does not automatically force a broker anyone else to locate and deliver shares in a way that would trigger short squeeze.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, see this looks right to me. 3.7. Most of these. So, for those that don't know what I'm doing. Here are the days to cover. All you do is take the average volume or for whatever period you're interested in. And then you divide the total number of short shares by that volume. And the idea is at current steady state volume. This is how many days it would take to cover. Here's the reality of things though, is that there's actually a scenario 3. And this is what I would consider to be a more accurate depiction of this is. And by scenario 2, I obviously mean scenario 3. The more accurate depiction of this would be like. Surge average volume. And what I mean by surge average volume is we can clearly see that there are periods where volume really starts to pick up heavy. And this is during periods when short covering starts to jack up. Right. So you can see that the stock can handle much more average volume. So if we go here, the five day average volume is 139 against 46.7. So let's just take the midpoint 139 million. 46.7. The average between those is 92 850. 92 50. And if we do the math using that surge volume. It's like three days. So the",

So this all of this is to go back to the idea and the current my current hypothesis is just that. It doesn't look like the conditions for a short squeeze are massive right now. There's not a lot of delta that's sitting out at dangerous levels. Well, what the fuck happened in the chat? Yo, I'd rather be skinned. First off, thank you so much for hooking some people up with a nice good old fashioned ally trading membership. It helps support the channel. Thank you so much. And let's take a quick look at. Game stop. And we want to take a look at gecks. Let's see. So we can see, I mean, most of it's around spot. And then there's a little bit elevated up here. To the long side, but most of the outstanding gecks right now, game exposure is actually negative on gamma, which is actually kind of kind of good. But. Yeah.

And without specifying who they are, let's explore that a little bit more. Let's take a look at. I'm going to chat you Pt talk to me about it. Teach me about. Reg show. 13 f dash two. it says. I went back into the 01. Okay. So let's see, say, the new 13 F2 would effectively introduce a parallel reporting framework for short positions. Okay. So there's been no equivalent for short position disclosure. Now there is monthly disclosures to SEC institutional managers meeting certain thresholds would report short positions and certain short selling activity monthly on a new form. The position level data would be submitted confidentially to the SEC not immediately disclosed to the public at the manager level. Aggregate public disclosure after a time delay the SEC would publish aggregated short sale data by issuer. But without revealing the identity of each manager's specific position, that's good. They should do that. Fresh holds, the proposal included specific thresholds to determine which managers have to file. Typically, it targets managers ready subject to 13 F reporting, so 100 million plus",

What are the penalties if the entity doesn't comply and disclose? Let's see. Civil enforcement actions is probably just fucking fines, man. Yeah, it looks like the main thing is they're talking about the fines. Russ says, and who are the non reporting entities? It looks like non reporting and well, let me ask. What would be considered the non reporting entity? My expectation is what we talked about funds that aren't over that threshold of 100 mil. Non so private companies, so a company that has not registered investment managers below the thresholds entities not subject to exchange act regulation or SEC requirements so they wouldn't comply with anything else. So this Russ and Mark, it looks like the non issuing and the non reporting entities would be what we would think, meaning the people that don't meet the disclosure requirement thresholds, which I mean to me, that makes sense to denote them as non reporting entities. That's what it looks like. Cool. Now that we're literally an hour in, we have like 15 minutes left. Two per fund analysis, by the way,",

I just got to update our timestamps. I've been a naughty person and really not helped it all. Sorry about that. We'll call it five minutes. This was the kickoff. And then we got into GameStop analysis. At like eight 20. And then now we're at 59 30. We're now getting into DD analysis. And then we're back to Lucy. Who I did reach out to. Okay. Let's continue. Russ says, ask Jets, UPT if they're exempt from, well, yeah, the reason why market makers would be exempt from it, that makes sense is because again, the short shares that a market maker would hold from a theoretical perspective is not to take a directional bet on the stock. If we think of the entities that are trying to push price down, it's typically institutions that then are in collusion with other supporting entities, but it's external entities because as always, market makers are going to be slaved to order flow. What order flow is they have to make markets. So the short positions conceivably that they maintain, then therefore would be not out of a directional",

So yeah, I actually don't think that there's a big issue with them doing that. I think the big issue with market makers is the game that they play with kicking the can around that, I think is bullshit. But that's because they're trying to avoid going out and actually buying shares when shares were scarce. I'm not so certain that that's is big of a deal as much now. Anyways, thankfully. All right. So we were going through this AMA with Lucy. We had done a bunch of work and then we came across, we came across a lot of research, but specifically that documentary was really cool. I enjoyed looking at that quite a lot. That's another one that I 100 would love to continue poking through with you all at some point. But that part aside, let's finish getting through Lucy's stuff here. I'm going to get our dinner order out of here so that we can stuff our faces.

Well, that starts to open the pure conflict of interest. But even if their hedge fund has a directional bias, they still are, they still are slave to order flow. They can't stop taking order flow because they actually have a requirement to keep their quote machines on. Otherwise, they start to lose different classification and designations. So there is to be clear, a massive conflict of interest. I'm not an advocate at all of Citadel having a hedge fund arm and market making arm like I think that that's incestuous. However, that being said, it's not like the Citadel market makers can just again, like move the price wherever they want it to be because Citadel as an institution might have a specific position in GameStop. They still are overall slave to broader order flow. There can be interplay there and I bet you I would completely feel confident betting you that there is. And as you all know, I'm not here to spread hype or fodder anything. My goal when I do stuff like this and when I interact with markets is just to look at stuff as objectively as I humanly can.

Let's see. In whose interest is it to not have a fair and equitable system? I mean, that's a kind of straightforward question, right? Like whoever stands to benefit, but it's in the interest of big broker dealers and hedge funds. Yep, okay. Which makes sense, right? Because they absolutely stand to benefit from it. So I don't think that's any sort of shocking take. I think that makes sense. Mostly given a pass by SEC and other exchanges. Sometimes they get a slap on the wrist, which we've seen slap on the wrist is very common and the slap on the wrist is a joke. It is like these really, really trivial points that are a complete joke relative to the size of the companies. Yep, here you go. Okay. So what's the next question?

Yeah, so I'm not going to pronounce the name, but this person has said, what are the best tools to determine how many shares there are in circulation? That's really, this is a great question. It seems that most people, Finra knows DTCC, they clear shares except they don't clear what goes off clearing, which is through the dark pools off clearing means not through regular clearing house and where a lot of the dirty stuff goes on DTCC subsidiary, subsidiary is the vault that actually holds all the shares and stocks. People do not have their own shares. Yep, yep, yep. The NSCC do the actual clearing. Nobody, no private person would really know it unless you got all the big prime brokers and all the others to do to tell everybody that the shares that they are moving, but I don't think they're okay.

My goal is literally to try to teach other people how to do some of this because I think something like the cover strangle is really probably one of the best possible ways for a lot of GameStop holders to trade GameStop and to trade around their holding positions. That's the broader idea behind that. REST's TSE was on your radar. Citadel really opening their own exchange with BlackRock. For me, no, I mean, that's that's nothing that's like significantly follow worthy for me. Now the TTC fly for those that is significant for me. When I was in Africa, you had to be real careful about this bastard because they have this disease that they carry that makes",

I forgot the, there's like a specific name for the, here you go. Hype Panosamyasis, the sleeping sickness. Yeah. So when I was in Africa, it was all eyes for the fucking TTC fly. Anytime something flew near you, you're immediately like no TTC fly. Stay away from me. We don't want none of that. So REST, TSE, not so much on my radar, the TTC fly heavily on my radar. I'm trying not to get bit by one of those bastards. If I can get through my whole life without getting nailed by a TTC fly, that will be a massive win for me. So I hope that answers. REST says Texas Stock Exchange coming soon. Yeah. I think that overall, that'll be good to be honest. I like the idea. And I think continued, I really do think continued competitiveness is just good. The more competition we can get in the broader sphere, the better off we are without a doubt. I definitely think that.

Here's another thing I wanted to run by you all actually while we're here while we're just bullshitting a little bit. I have a slight proposition. The proposition that I have is trying to trading 25k for this is honestly pretty annoying. And I would rather trade more. But the original idea was to trade this in a way that is as representative as possible for like the normal person. So the question is, is 25 still okay? I already have a slightly, well not a slightly quite a bit larger of an allocation that I trade in the broader portfolio. Like the coverage strangles that I share with you guys are just a subset essentially of what I trade in the in the broader portfolio with some differences because of that. Right? Like this is naturally a smaller, a smaller position. So it means I can't trade as many contracts. So that'll have different impacts on the total performance of the position. But I'm trying to get a sense from everybody specifically those that hold game stop. Like I imagine the most of you just hold your shares. Is that correct?

Agro crag says, freakalique to tariffs cause GME downward bone cone. That's actually a really great question to be H. I think the tariffs are likely to push the whole market down. So I'm still short futures against the broader long delta that I have because the near term expectation is downside play probably. That's my guess. And it's because there's going to be some short term. There's going to be some short term pain. I think that will come from this, be honest. So yeah.

So that's the video that talks about the coverage strangle and GameStop, or at least introduces it for you. So let me see where Joe or Steve. So Steve, back to you. I'm specifically curious about your understanding with something like the coverage strangle. Like do you do you kind of get like the the base concepts of what it is and how it can be used? The reason is because I think GameStop is probably one of the ideal candidates for somebody like you, literally somebody like you specifically.

Let's talk about that for a second because there's a handful of ways. Actually that I see. Let's go here. There's literally only a few ways I see is logical of trading options with GameStop. So scenario one is trading options or really just buy it home. scenario two, why is this lagging? Is I would argue ratio covered calls? So this means we have at least one-on-one shares and then we sell calls against those shares. But we always maintain upside. scenario three would be wheel which equals cash-secured puts until assigned then it's long equity plus covered calls. I don't like this one. Next scenario is covered strangle which equals long equity ratio covered calls and cash-secured puts. Then scenario five would be long options. This includes both calls and puts. And I guess you could argue you could do a scenario six and scenario six would just be short puts. This either naked or cash-secured. Now the other way that you can trade this scenario seven would be long straddle slash strangle. That's to play the expansion of volatility.

There are other ways to do it but these are the only ones that I think make any sense. And to clarify the ways that you'll typically see me trade it. I have this element. The reason why this element exists is because of an agreement that I made. Also Joe brings up a really great scenario. Thank you. I actually didn't think of this one. But scenario eight would be a ratio. So. All diagonal. Which I still would not trade personally but this is a scenario. So. And I'll explain why. So by and hold that's part of the broader portfolio. I really don't do just this but this would be the next stair step for anybody that is doing this. This is like the next natural path. Then I don't do this one. I don't do this one. I do this one. I do this one. I do this one. And I do this one. The reason why I don't do these.

So if you're assigned during a squeeze that becomes a little bit of a logistical burden if you're covering it with long options. L. George says I got an email saying I have a month trial from you.
