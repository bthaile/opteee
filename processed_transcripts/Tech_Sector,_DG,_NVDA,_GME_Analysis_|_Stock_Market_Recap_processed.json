    "text": "what's up outliers got three things for the market update today first we're going to talk about Dollar General then we're going to talk about the tech sector then we're going to talk about GameStop let's get right to it so the first thing is Dollar General had a hell of a day today and as you can tell it closed at the bottom of this candle it just got shoved down all day it tried to Rally a little bit post earnings and its earnings wasn't abysmal but it definitely was wasn't good so we can take a look through what happened this was before the market opened and it dropped over 25 and we can see that it came in at 170 per share which is down from 213 year-over-year and it was expected at 179 net sales came in 1021 10.21 billion which actually expanded that doesn't seem you know too bad to me but this is the big problem so it expects fiscal 2024 EPS of 550 to 620 and sales growth 4.7 to 5.3 which is down so yeah this is one of the things that you'll find with forward guidance is this exact kind of scenario the market was originally expecting it at 712 this obviously is really missing that to the downside unfortunately for them so they are behind the curve here now the other thing I want to take a look at with you is just the indices but specifically Tech because",
