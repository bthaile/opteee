    "text": "What's up everybody? Eric here. Welcome back to the outlier podcast where we talk about all things extraordinary. I'm here with David Hunter yet again for another conversation. I was actually looking back at our conversations and I think we started connecting in the spring of 22. So it's been about two years. I wanted to wish you a happy anniversary. It's been great for me. I hope it's been great for you. Yeah, it's been great Eric. Great to know you. So we were literally just talking off air for a couple of seconds just about how interesting things are and I feel like every time we connect, you know, you and I maintain like a quarterly cadence give or take and there's always stuff that pops up. So I honestly would love to just start right there with you as you think about the markets today and as you think about the economy, the world today specifically over the last week or so like what's jumping out at you? Yeah, it's definitely been a period where the markets are nervous and given lots of reasons to be nervous, you know, it started out weeks ago with inflation kind of raising its ugly head and everybody was kind of expecting inflation to be trending further down from here from where it was when it came into this year and instead it went the other way for, you know, less two or three months. Excuse me. And so, you know,",

Excuse me. And so, you know, you had the bond market back up. You had investors get nervous that the Fed's not going to cut and start out with, well, it's not six cuts. May it be it's three and then it's down to two. Now people worried that we're not going to get cuts this year. So you get you get all of that and then on top of that we get what's going on in the Middle East and investors are certainly nervous. What's interesting is that, you know, the SEP hasn't even backed up 4. You know, it's been maybe 3.8 from the all-time highs and that's with all this distress and all, you know, investors very nervous. As I say, you know, yes, you had a big move from last October, you know, almost 30 in I think 31 in the NASDAQ and almost 30 in the SP and 30 in the Russell. You had that run and people got more bullish obviously. The tape moved up and investors got more bullish. But what I've noticed is that they're bullish without conviction, which means when you get a roll over like we've had this last month, you know, first it started out",

But what I've noticed is that they're bullish without conviction, which means when you get a roll over like we've had this last month, you know, first it started out kind of flat. Now it's rolled over this week with what's going on in Israel. People run through the hills quickly. They turn tail very quickly. So there they yes, they got more bullish with the tape and that's kind of how it works. But they aren't there with conviction. So it doesn't take much for them to lose that bullishness and go back the other way. That's a good thing from a standpoint of my outlook, I think, which is bullish. And because I think that just builds that wall of worry back up very quickly. So you don't need 10 and 15 corrections. You get what you would normally get with a 10 correction. You get with something that's less than half of that. So I think we have, you know, lots of things to worry about out there. But I don't think any of it's going to interrupt the meltup. Interesting. So I saw a comment literally from Powell's QA in Washington today. Powell had said, this is a quote from him. It says quote, the recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence and instead indicate that it is likely to take longer than expected",

It says quote, the recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence and instead indicate that it is likely to take longer than expected to achieve that confidence. Obviously, this has to do with inflation. And their disposition towards how they want to manage inflation. To me, it seemed like the market got a bit of a head of itself. And you could see that written in even across the bond market, starting to price in cuts. And then I think the recent bit of data ingestion has shocked that a little bit. What are your thoughts on that? Yeah, I agree with that. Certainly. The market got way ahead of itself with expecting six cuts. And then it, you know, as I said, it took her down to three and then two. And now with Powell's comments, you know, there are people wondering if we're going to get a cut this year. He's not coming out and saying, we can't have a cut in June. He's not coming out and saying, we can't have cuts this year. But he's basically, and I've claimed this over and over defended him over and said, he's being as transparent as he can be. You know, take him at his word. He's not trying to fool you. He's not trying to, you know, play games with you",

He's not trying to fool you. He's not trying to, you know, play games with you like Greenspan used to be do where you had to read between the lines. What he says is what he, what he thinks at the time. And what he's thinking right now is what I think the street is thinking, which is, gee, we've had three months in a row where inflation ticked up. And, you know, we were expecting to tick down. You know, we've got an economy that continues to show resilience. What's the rush? We don't need to cut right away and then create a problem for ourselves down the road by being premature in that cut. So, so I think he's basically equalling what the street already expected or saw. And I think you see that in the markets after then because his comments in other times might have been taken bearishly and you might have the market down 2. Instead, the market's up. It's hold off on his comments initially, not all that far, but it did sell off. And now it's turned right around and we're not quite at the highs for the day, but we're up there.

You know, it could go, you know, it could reverse this week and go a little lower, but I'm not looking for any big correction here. I think, yeah, as I said, we rebuilt the wall, worried with not a lot of so off. Now, out of curiosity, when I look at markets, I tend to think that they're pretty smart. There's a lot of people that interact with markets with a lot of good data. And the fact that we got again, seemingly pretty far ahead of ourselves, it surprises me a little bit. Just, I'm wondering, what's the function from a market perspective that would lead them to front run the move quite that much? Because when I've been looking at this from a lay person's perspective, it's been very clear the way Powell, at least, has been synthesizing the data. And I've been kind of not quite mimicking him, but thinking of it in the same way. Like you see the data released and then you make an assumption, but it seemed like the market had been front running that data so much and it seemed like they were just like pretty far off.

I don't understand why they would do that. Like what's the built in incentive for them to do that? Yeah, it's interesting because I think when you refer to the market, I think you're referring to the professional investment community basically, right? You're thinking in terms of the market participants with large numbers and the supposed least smart money. When I refer to the market, I refer to the market in the aggregate, which includes all investors, whoever's in there, it's what the market is saying. So not what the smart investor is saying or the street analyst is saying, it's what the market's saying. And those are two different things. Because as you know, the so-called smart money fought this rally all the way up from 3,500 to 2 years, a year and a half ago. When it was 3,500 on the SP, it didn't get bullish until we were up over 4,800 basically. And so they may be smart money, but they got it wrong. Meanwhile, the market itself, for whatever reason, saw a reason for it to keep going. And as you know, I basically have echoed the market in terms of, in terms of what the market is doing,",

So what I think the market is anticipating and seeing and what I'm seeing is that ultimately, no matter whether it's this month, next month, two months ago, four months ahead, we're nearing the end of a tightening cycle. That tightening cycle has been going on for two years. That's a big deal. And ultimately, in spite of the numbers that may say, we're going to have no landing or a soft landing or no recession, I think underneath the surface, there are lots of signs that we are heading for a recession. And as you know, I think it's going to be a lot more than recession, you know, going robust. But in the meantime, what you get is you're taking it to, because the economy's operating at a pretty low recovery level. It's not roaring cut. Inflation has been trending down in the last few months, notwithstanding. And what you've got is inflation that was 9 now down at three, essentially, depending on the measure you want to use.

The market in the aggregate generally is a better predictor of the future than any individual, no matter how smart we are. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And actually, I'd like to double-click on that from a structural standpoint to understand your perspective a little bit better, because when I think about the market, quote-unquote, I typically think about players that have enough capital to make a meaningful movement in price. So to your point, I typically would exonerate retail out of there, because there's very few retail traders that could even put it done to anything. Now, going back to your point on this idea of smart money versus the market, how do you differentiate between those two in your world view? Because obviously, if we go from 3550 to 60 in the SP, there has to be big money that moves that. It doesn't just go up there from like retail traders buying.

Yeah, this is not a kind of a either or of either retail or professionals. And it's not, investors aren't monolithic. So there are very bearish people that are considered some of the best investors out there. They're very bullish people who might be considered some of the top investors out there, and there are people in between. So again, I'm not trying to pick and choose which investors have this right. It's the fact that the market is a discounting mechanism, and when you put all investors in there together, they're discounting what in the aggregate they see. And that way, it's not about analyzing what kind of economy are we in, or what it's basically understanding the market predicts the future. It is, and again, what's tricky about that is sometimes the market gets it wrong. So you have to kind of decide where you are in that. But generally, it's the law of large numbers.

I go think about what he's doing. He's taking out of his basket of indicators, the stock market, which in my opinion is the best leading indicator. It is the most accurate predictor of the future. And by forcing it to where he wants it to go or thinking, he can force it to go somewhere. He's removed it as an indicator, and he's deciding he knows best where it should be.

I see. So yeah, I actually think then in general, you and I probably have a pretty similar view on what we would consider the market. Now, when you think the market gets so far ahead of itself, meaning in terms of discounting and including the prospects for a cut, what do you think drives that? Is it people just trying to get in at the very precipice of a move to maximize the move? Do you think that there's other imperatives that drive the behavior? I'm just curious from a broad perspective, what would get a lot of people to pile into something. Because when I look at it from my point of view as a trader, I look at it as, and this has been my entire point of view the whole time, like actually very similar to Powell.

And that we are going to be in a sweet spot where you'd have very low growth if not negative at the same time that you almost were at or even could possibly get below the 2 target on inflation. So, you know, when we entered this year, I think that's where the mindset was and that's great pretty much bottomed out there. You know, on the bond market was, you know, they anticipate as did I, that the economy was probably going to be weaker going forward this year. And that inflation was going to continue to trend towards target if not get there. And frankly, that the Fed was behind the curve because short rates were still up at 5. You know, Fed fund rate was over 5 and that if inflation is down at 2, you've got a pretty hefty real rate there, which is restrictive. And if the economy is softening and it's restrictive, you've got a problem. And it means you've got to cut several times to get down to a level where you're not going to create a hard landing.

And then, you know, January, February, data kind of, caused them to question some of that mindset and take some of those cuts off the table. And then I think March was just a real surprise to them. Well, I, you know, 1-10th percent tick up, you know, uptick from expectations. But I think they were thinking, you know, the whole housing real estate rental part of the CPI is overstating, you know, house prices and then inflation in the real estate sector. And so we're going to get at some point here and we think it could be March. We're going to get that finally factor in and we're going to get a better expected number. Instead, we got to worse the expected number and just caused a really quick readjustment to questioning whether we were going to have, you know, the three cuts that they had thought or whether it's going to be two.

I thought we'd probably have a spring bounce and housing that was pretty good. Not, you know, we wouldn't go back to the highs in either activity or prices, but that we'd have a pretty good spring bounce and that that might actually feed into a little bit of a worry about, you know, the economy re-accelerating, inflation, re-accelerating.

And I think it was an apartment building that ended up selling very, very cheap compared to where it was very recently. So just another indicator of that, but going back to just housing from a broader perspective, part of me looks at it as the in office scenario for workers in general has changed a lot. And we still have a lot of office buildings. I don't think that they would all go away. But what are your thoughts on the future of office buildings in general? Do you think they're going to start getting repurposed into other style buildings? Or do you think that that's going to be just a fallen part of the market in the not so distant future? It's kind of a niche question. But I find that one to be interesting because when I look at different kinds of office building inventory, it's not contracting.

But I know that some buildings are easier to remake into housing. Some of the downtown areas where New York City or somewhere like that, where there's a real need for housing. It could bring some of the prices down for apartments and things. They're trying to do it and it depends on the building, I think, as to whether it's easily converted or how expensive it's going to be. You see that around the country, I think, to some extent. But it's kind of case-by-case building by building what makes sense. I think the malls are trying to repurpose to some extent because they've lost anchors and they've lost retail stores. So I saw something recently where one mall was converting some of the mall to housing. So they've actually been there right next door to their housing. So I think you will see definitely see it's not just going to die. There'll be new uses. Obviously industrial commercial is up and coming.

So I know there are companies trying to bring their employees back and some have been successful doing it and others not as much. It's a tough one. People really have learned and certainly technology supported them in terms of being able to be productive at home and not have to go through two-hour commutes. Obviously, we're dealing with, in some of these inner cities, now more problems, whether it be from the migrants, whether it be from, you know, our being less willing to keep people in jail.

It's interesting to me because from a trading standpoint, whenever I see stuff like this, I can't help but look for opportunities. And to me, that does seem like a budding opportunity. However, I do invest in commercial real estate with some partners and the right environment right now actually kind of puts a damper on the party. Not any of us are overly excited to be the ones to try the fun stuff right now. So it's an interesting perspective. Plus, plus you've got an awful lot of refinancing is in this window over the next year or two, I think. And unless rates cooperate and come down, that's going to probably create another wave of problems for real estate. So and for the banks. So it's probably early. I'd say the opportunities there might still be a couple of years off. You know, you're in a half off. So it's tempting when you see the problem and you see that, you know, you see like that say, like mentioned.

But stepping away from real estate going back to markets, I've noticed a few interesting themes specifically relating to the sectors where over the past three months, we're kind of getting a bit of a change in vanguard where if I look over the past six months, I see mostly tech leading the pack. So commercial communication services, information technology kind of standard fare.

Yeah, I think it's all all the above. We we really have when you step back and look particularly at the SP, but also the other markets, we really have had you know six or seven weeks here of consolidation where it kind of topped out back in, I don't know, early March, late February, early March. And we've gone sideways. And again, this week or in the last week rolled over some, but basically still in a kind of a high level consolidation. So some of what you saw with the market wasn't giving up a lot, but you were rotating. So you did have some of that sector rotation.

So, I think there's going to be just ahead, not very far ahead here, a broadening of market, you know, resuming at a rally and probably getting steeper as we go. So, specifically for the banks, I find that perspective really interesting because a lot of what we're seeing across the banks here, at least for the smaller banks, is actually, I would consider more weakness. So, what gets you interested in them at these levels? Yeah, and I haven't looked out of this week, but I think what you're seeing is higher interest rates obviously hits them, you know, particularly the regionals with what happened, you know, a year ago. So, you got a kind of run, I think, and again, I don't have charts in front of me, but I think if you've run your perspective and look at longer charts, you may see it in the context of a group that started to come alive and then got hit with the higher rates and is consolidated those that run, but hasn't broken down and I think they will go.

Yeah, because I was just curious, I've been trading earnings, specifically for the big banks, you know, all SP 500 banks as they're coming out and they're all obviously having hired chargeoffs, they're seeing lower interest driven returns, but they're able to compensate it in other ways, but we know the smaller regional banks don't necessarily have the suite of tools to be able to pull together quite as well, but that makes sense when you explain it.

Now, going back to metals, I was actually checking out aluminum because aluminum had been hopping a little bit. What are your perspectives on metals in general? One of the questions I know everybody has for you typically is gold and silver and kind of the the relationship and comparison between those two, but I also would like to get into some of the niche metals like you were talking about copper aluminum specifically, top of mind for me, but happy to start with gold and silver. Yeah, so, you know, I'll start with the base metals first, but I think there was, and I didn't follow closely, but they did something to take out supply from Russia, you know, they're full around with the sanctions.

Silver took a bigger hit as it typically does, but I think it's coming back from that night. I, you know, I continue to say, I think gold's going to 3,000 this year. Silver, I think, is going to 60, and maybe 75 this year. That's a huge run. Very short term, I think silver can get up into the mid-times, 30s pretty quickly. Gold probably can get up over 2,500 pretty quickly, so, so I think you got, you know, room to run there for sure. The miners which have lagged and everybody's frustrated by have come alive.

Do you think that people are seeing some sort of fundamental shift in the future that will want to rotate them into gold? Yeah, well, first of all, keep in mind that we had really four tries, triple, a triple top, and then the fourth try it finally broke through. So, it was between 17, 18, 1800 and 21, 104, you know, a couple of years there where I tried and tried again and tried again and was always turned back. So that breakout is a big deal.

How does that factor into your forecast there? Yeah, like I said, I do a lot across market work, and I just have a hard time squaring that with what I see across many sectors and across many stocks. In the tech sector, and I can't name names, I would love to, because there's some names there that look outstanding that just tell me that there's big upside ahead. It's not just semis. It's in other areas. Then in the industrials, I've already talked about what Copper looks like, what steel looks like. There's a lot upside there. The broker dealers is a big tell for me, because if they're going to go up, that means that the stock market's going up right. You're not going to have a big run in stock brokers if the market's going south. Those are for me indicators of a market that is poised for much higher and soon. I think what I would argue is you've had a yes, the consolidation has been more than I expected, but you had 120 base point drop in rates in a few months' time.

It's actually held up better than other aspects of the bond market. It looks to me like it can reverse here and have a nice run. That speaks to an economy that's not falling out of bed. That speaks to interest rates that are probably going to go down, not up. When I look at investment grade, it's been held along with treasuries. By the way, I think it looks like it's getting oversold now and ready for another move. I think it's easy to extrapolate a move. That's what most people do. Oh, they're going higher. That's how I forecast. I mean, I'm looking at indicators that tell me it's more likely that you've had your consolidation.

If I put everything I see together, what I get as a scenario that basically says, the economy still has enough legs. The industrial area is non-consumer areas that have lagged for a while. They've been dealing with trying to get them in the inventory down and rationalize their production to what the band is out there. I think they're starting to show signs that inventory is in good shape, but they're beginning to produce again. I think the industrial side of the economy looks like it's going to be pretty good into the summer. It's not about to fall out of bed. It's actually getting stronger.

Now, if you were to assign a confidence interval on the probability of that thesis playing out as you outlined, let's say in the next few months, as you're kind of thinking about how confident are you as of right now with what you know now that it'll play out in that frame? Yeah, I never put a number on, but what I have said is this is a high conviction call. It's not high conviction that it's going to happen between now and June or between now and July. It's high conviction that it's going to happen in a concentrated period whether that is three months, six months, you know, but to go 40 or 50 percent, yes, and the Russell, I'm actually where it is now is more than 60 percent to my target. To have that all happen in less than six months is unheard of. So that's my conviction. You know, I can't pretend to know which month we tap out, but my conviction is the next several months. And it could very well be that it's mostly done by the middle of the year, or it may be that it's not done until September, October. I don't know, but my conviction is that we are in for the steepest rally in history, or what certainly steepest, broadest rally in history. You know, Nasdaq might have been",

You know, Nasdaq might have been steeper in 2000, 99, 2000, but this will come pretty close to that. Mark it just closed. It landed down slightly down almost a quarter point. So not good. A couple of other questions for you real quick. One of them is one of the parts of your thesis I'm always interested to learn a little bit more about is the bust portion. And the things there that I'm always fascinated by and what I try to draw the listeners attention to. I know a lot of people they cling on to the numbers that you say because they're big numbers, right? Obviously somebody would latch on to that. But what I try to direct people to is your to use your term that reading the tea leaves. I try to pull out the way that you think about and construct a narrative based on your breadth of experience because guess what? The only way you get 50 years in Wall Street is by being in Wall Street for 50 years. You can't accelerate that time frame. I spend a lot of time in markets, but I've been them for 16 years less than half of what you've seen. So",

I spend a lot of time in markets, but I've been them for 16 years less than half of what you've seen. So it is really interesting to me to tap into the way that you connect concepts together. So leading into the bust, what are the catalysts in your view after we go through this melt-up phase which could take however long it takes, but the thesis being it'll be a condensed period when it does start. What then rolls us over into the bust because one of the things we talked about previously was kind of the global economy. And right now at least as far as I could tell emerging countries don't look great. Let's be clear. But some of the other just global our houses seem to be doing okay here. So I'd like to know if that part of your thesis has adjusted at all, but more importantly, what are the primary catalysts once we get to this blow off top that rolls us over? Yeah, first in terms of the other countries, what I'd say is I'm not sure it's all that different from here and from the standpoint of there's a lot of fragility underneath the surface. The countries I'll just look at Europe as an example. It's been really amazing to see that two years",

The countries I'll just look at Europe as an example. It's been really amazing to see that two years ago, they didn't know where their energy was going to come from. There was all kinds of horror stories about what that winter was going to look like after Ukraine was invaded and they fortunately had enough stockpiled. They got through that one and then the story was next winter where they were in that problems. And the costs involved for them to purchase energy elsewhere on the market when they lost the pipeline from Russia, from Ukraine was amazing to me that they were able to kind of soldier their way through that and stay above water. They traded water but they stayed above water. Listening to LeCard today, she contrasted the US and Europe from the standpoint of saying, yeah, we're hanging in there but the difference is the US has a resilient consumer who spends, spends, spends, we don't have that. She said our consumption is not showing those trends. So I would take issue with those saying that the rest of the world is in pretty good shape. I think they're in worse shape than us but they're kind of doing what we are which is kind of muddling through and you think that maybe this",

My concern is that's not the case. This is the good side and then we turn down from here and I would say the same thing. Canada, I'm getting this is anecdotal but I see on Twitter and many videos and stuff of lots of people up north saying I can't afford to live here anymore. I don't know where to run to but true dose made such a mess of this economy. I'm dying up here. It's the story we hear here in the US from a lot of young people saying I can't afford to live on my own, I have to go back home. You see in Canada times three. So I think Canada is not in great shape. Their policies are I think doing harm to their consumer too. Australia I think is some of that. China we know is in trouble.

The central bank own their bonds and not have that go the other way at some point really cause you know what we saw on steroids. You know once their rates break out there and they're a quandary and besides that the ends break, the young keep going lower and so I actually, and this is not a prediction but I wonder if we're getting close to some sort of a currency accord like the plaza accord in 1985 where you actually coordinate a devaluation of the dollar versus these other currencies triggered by the yen basically saying you know both the euro and the yen are having trouble, are struggling to you know not go down and maybe you know maybe we need to do this and it certainly wouldn't hurt the US to have dollar weaker. So I would not be surprised if that may be some of what the metals market is sniffing out but again I'm not predicting that because it may not happen but I think it's potential out there.

So you know we're so far beyond the leverage we had in 2008-09 and that's why 2008-09 happened was because of massive leverage we're so far beyond those levels now that I think the next downturn when it happens you know just go straight down and particularly a financial system and we've got a combination of all that leverage and and the risks combined with central banks that are hell bent not to",
