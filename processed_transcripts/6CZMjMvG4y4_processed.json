I'm here with David Hunter yet again for another conversation. I was actually looking back at our conversations and I think we started connecting in the spring of 22. So it's been about two years. I wanted to wish you a happy anniversary. It's been great for me. I hope it's been great for you. Yeah, it's been great Eric. Great to know you. So we were literally just talking off air for a couple of seconds just about how interesting things are and I feel like every time we connect, you know, you and I maintain like a quarterly cadence give or take and there's always stuff that pops up. So I honestly would love to just start right there with you as you think about the markets today and as you think about the economy, the world today specifically over the last week or so like what's jumping out at you? Yeah, it's definitely been a period where the markets are nervous and given lots of reasons to be nervous, you know, it started out weeks ago with inflation kind of raising its ugly head and everybody was kind of expecting inflation to be trending further",

Yeah, it's definitely been a period where the markets are nervous and given lots of reasons to be nervous, you know, it started out weeks ago with inflation kind of raising its ugly head and everybody was kind of expecting inflation to be trending further down from here from where it was when it came into this year and instead it went the other way for, you know, less two or three months. Excuse me. And so, you know, you had the bond market back up. You had investors get nervous that the Fed's not going to cut and start out with, well, it's not six cuts. May it be it's three and then it's down to two. Now people worried that we're not going to get cuts this year. So you get you get all of that and then on top of that we get what's going on in the Middle East and investors are certainly nervous. What's interesting is that, you know, the SEP hasn't even backed up 4. You know, it's been maybe 3.8 from the all-time highs and that's with all this distress and all, you know, investors very nervous. As I say, you know, yes, you had a big move from last October, you know, almost 30 in I think 31 in the NASDAQ and almost 30 in the SP and 30 in the Russell.

You had that run and people got more bullish obviously. The tape moved up and investors got more bullish. But what I've noticed is that they're bullish without conviction, which means when you get a roll over like we've had this last month, you know, first it started out kind of flat. Now it's rolled over this week with what's going on in Israel. People run through the hills quickly. They turn tail very quickly. So there they yes, they got more bullish with the tape and that's kind of how it works. But they aren't there with conviction. So it doesn't take much for them to lose that bullishness and go back the other way. That's a good thing from a standpoint of my outlook, I think, which is bullish. And because I think that just builds that wall of worry back up very quickly. So you don't need 10 and 15 corrections. You get what you would normally get with a 10 correction. You get with something that's less than half of that. So I think we have, you know, lots of things to worry about out there. But I don't think any of it's going to interrupt the meltup. Interesting.

Interesting. So I saw a comment literally from Powell's QA in Washington today. Powell had said, this is a quote from him. It says quote, the recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence and instead indicate that it is likely to take longer than expected to achieve that confidence. Obviously, this has to do with inflation. And their disposition towards how they want to manage inflation. To me, it seemed like the market got a bit of a head of itself. And you could see that written in even across the bond market, starting to price in cuts. And then I think the recent bit of data ingestion has shocked that a little bit. What are your thoughts on that? Yeah, I agree with that. Certainly. The market got way ahead of itself with expecting six cuts. And then it, as I said, it took her down to three and then two. And now with Powell's comments, you know, there are people wondering if we're going to get a cut this year. He's not coming out and saying, we can't have a cut in June. He's not coming out and saying we can't have cuts this year. But he's basically, and I've claimed this over and over defended him over and",

He's not trying to, you know, play games with you like Greenspan used to be do where you had to read between the lines. What he says is what he, what he thinks at the time. And what he's thinking right now is what I think the street is thinking, which is, gee, we've had three months in a row where inflation ticked up. And, you know, we're expecting to tick down. We've got an economy that continues to show resilience. What's the rush? We don't need to cut right away and then create a problem for ourselves down the road by being premature in that cut. So, so I think he's basically echoing what the street already expected or saw. And I think you see that in the markets because his comments in other times might have been taken bearishly and you might have had the market down 2. Instead, the market's up.

You know, it could go, you know, it could reverse this week and go a little lower, but I'm not looking for any big correction here. I think, yeah, as I said, we rebuilt the wall, worried with not a lot of so off. Now out of curiosity, when I look at markets, I tend to think that they're pretty smart. There's a lot of people that interact with markets with a lot of good data. And the fact that we got, again, seemingly pretty far ahead of ourselves, it surprises me a little bit. Just I'm wondering what's the function from a market perspective that would lead them to front run the move quite that much? Because when I've been looking at this from a layperson's perspective, it's been very clear the way Powell, at least, has been synthesizing the data and I've been kind of not quite mimicking him, but thinking of it in the same way.

I don't understand why they would do that. Like what's the built-in incentive for them to do that? Yeah, it's interesting because I think when you refer to the market, I think you're referring to the professional investment community basically, right? You're thinking in terms of the long-term participants for large. And the supposed least smart money. When I refer to the market, I refer to the market in the aggregate, which includes all investors, whoever's in there, it's what the market is saying. So not what the smart investor is saying or the street analyst is saying, it's what the market is saying. And those are two different things because as you know, the so-called smart money fought this rally all the way up from 3,500, two years to a year and a half ago. When it was 3,500 on the SP, it didn't get bullish until we were up over 4,800 basically. And so they may be smart money, but they got it wrong.

And so they may be smart money, but they got it wrong. Meanwhile, the market itself, for whatever reason, saw a reason for it to keep going. And as you know, I basically have echoed the market in terms of, you know, anticipating what the market is doing in terms of being bullish when most people were bearish and saying we were going to have a melt-up. So what I think the market is anticipating and seeing, and what I'm seeing is that ultimately, no matter whether it's this month, next month, two months ago, four months ahead, we're nearing the end of a tightening cycle. That tightening cycle has been going on for two years. That's a big deal. And ultimately, in spite of the numbers that may say, we're going to have no landing or a soft landing or no recession, I think underneath the surface, there are lots of signs that we are heading for a recession. And as you know, I think it's going to be a lot more than recession, you know, going robust. But in the meantime, what you get is you're taking it to because the economy's operating at a pretty low recovery level. It's not roaring, caught. Inflation has been trending down in the last few months, notwithstanding. And what you've got",

And what you've got is inflation that was 9 now down at three, essentially, depending on the measure you want to use. And ultimately, in my opinion, and I think the market's been still trending down, it just isn't going to be a straight line. So I think that's what the market's picking up. And as you know, I look at what I call cross-market, I look at a lot of things underneath the surface in terms of individual companies and sectors, et cetera. And they're saying the same thing, which is we're about to have things that have been out of favor, come into favor. So copper producers, which have been out of favor for quite some time, are now starting to look great. They're moving to certainly 12-month highs and beyond. And they look like they've got 50-75 upside in them. That doesn't happen in a situation that fits what this so-called smart money thinks we're heading for, which is higher for longer an economy that needs in-treat cuts, but it isn't going to get them inflation that's trending up, not down.

So I think I learned long ago, I haven't done this for 50 years, to pay attention on the market when it disagrees with that so-called smart money, or, you know, the informed professional investor or analyst. You know, they can get it right sometimes, but they don't always. And I think the market in the aggregate, it's law of large numbers. The market in the aggregate generally is a better predictor of the future than any individual, no matter how smart we are. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And actually, I'd like to double-click on that from a structural standpoint to understand your perspective a little bit better, because when I think about the market, quote-unquote, I typically think about players that have enough capital to make a meaningful movement in price. So to your point, I typically would exonerate retail out of there, because there's very few retail traders that could even put it done to anything. Now, going back to your point on this idea of smart money versus the market, how do you differentiate between those two in your world view? Because obviously, if we go from 3550 to 60 in the SP, there has to be big money that moves that. It doesn't just go",

So who are the people driving that price appreciation in your world? Yeah, this is not a kind of a either or of either retail or professionals. And it's not, investors aren't monolithic. So there are very bearish people that are considered some of the best investors out there. They're very bullish people who might be considered some of the top investors out there, and there are people in between. So again, I'm not trying to pick and choose which investors have this right. It's the fact that the market is a discounting mechanism, and when you put all investors in there together, they're discounting what in the aggregate they see. And that way, it's not about analyzing what kind of economy are we in, or what it's basically understanding the market predicts the future. It is, and again, what's tricky about that is sometimes the market gets it wrong. So you have to kind of decide where you are in that. But generally, it's the law of large numbers.

As I used to take Paul to ask when he was, and I think he's still doing some extent, but when he was really, he and his minions on the FOMC were saying so much time trying to job on the market down and deciding where the market should go. I go think about what he's doing. He's taking out of his basket of indicators, the stock market, which in my opinion is the best leading indicator. It is the most accurate predictor of the future. And by forcing it to where he wants it to go or thinking, he can force it to go somewhere. He's removed it as an indicator, and he's deciding he knows best where it should be. I don't know if that's confusing, but to me, the stock market is one of our best, if not the best leading indicator. Again, it's not full profit.

I see. So yeah, I actually think then in general, you and I probably have a pretty similar view on what we would consider the market. Now, when you think the market gets so far ahead of itself, meaning in terms of discounting and including the prospects for a cut, what do you think drives that? Is it people just trying to get in at the very precipice of a move to maximize the move? Do you think that there's other imperatives that drive the behavior? I'm just curious from a broad perspective, what would get a lot of people to pile into something. Because when I look at it from my point of view as a trader, I look at it as, and this has been my entire point of view the whole time, like actually very similar to Powell.

And the reason I'm asking this question is to differentiate for your kind of melt up scenario if that's going to be more of a mania driven event? Yeah, good question. I'll give you my take on the whole rate cutting thing and how we got there. People have speculated about why did they build in six cuts? There was no reason to build in six cuts or how did they get there. And I think, and again, that's really bond investors, right? Not the stock market, but the bond investor, the fixed income investor was trying to figure what the Fed was going to do.

And you know, you look at the futures market that basically predicting six cuts for this year. I think they kind of took the ball and ran with it in terms of the whole scenario that the economy is weakening and inflation is coming down faster than the Fed thought. And that we are going to be in a sweet spot where you'd have very low growth if not negative at the same time that you almost were at or even could possibly get below the 2 target on inflation. So, you know, when we entered this year, I think that's where the mindset was, and that's pretty much bottomed out there. You know, on the bond market was, you know, they anticipated, as did I, that the economy was probably going to be weaker going forward this year. And that inflation was going to continue to trend towards target if not get there. And frankly, that the Fed was behind the curve because short rates were still up at 5, you know, Fed fund rate was over 5, and that if inflation is down at 2, you've got a pretty hefty real rate there, which is restrictive. And if the economy is softening and it's restrictive, you get a problem. And it means you've got to cut several times to get down to a level",

And they came into this year with that mindset. And then, you know, January, February, that kind of question, to question some of that mindset and take some of those cuts off the table. And then I think March was just a real surprise to them. Well, I, you know, one tenth of percent tick up tick from expectations. But I think they were thinking, you know, the whole housing real estate rental part of the CPI is overstating, you know, house prices and inflation in the real estate sector.

And I'm still, I believe, or that what we're looking at here is a consolidation, although it went farther than I expected, or I thought it would need to consolidation of that 120 base point drop in the 10 year, you know, in the fourth quarter, we went from 5 to 380.

But still, I think we're going to prove to be a consolidation of that run. And we'll just roll back over. And I still think we're going to head 3, you know, in coming months.

Those were forecasted at 1.485 million. And they came in at 1.321. And then building permits, they were forecasted at 1.51. Those came in at 1.458. So both starts and permits contract in a little bit. Does that mean anything to you? A little bit. I would say, coming into the spring with the interest rate forecast that I had and what the street was expecting until this last few weeks, I thought we'd probably have a spring bounce in housing that was pretty good. It's not, you know, we wouldn't go back to the highs in either activity or prices, but that we'd have a pretty good spring bounce and that that might actually feed into a little bit of a worry about, you know, the economy re-accelerating, inflation re-accelerating. What we've actually gotten, I think, is that, you know, from a standpoint of those that want strong housing, I think this backup in rates in the last few weeks really puts a damper on that spring bounce.

Obviously we're saying housing, so I would think towards single homes. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. Housing is talking specifically about that. The commercial real estate, obviously the office buildings made the circuit, I think, a week ago, where there was a building in St. Louis that sold for like the big skyscraper.

You know, that once we get into that global bust, probably next year, mostly, that you will see I would be surprised again, every market's local in housing, but I would be surprised if cross the board we saw something like on the average, a 30 or more decline in home prices from the peak.

And we still have a lot of office buildings. I don't think that they would all go away, but what are your thoughts on the future of office buildings in general? Do you think they're going to start getting repurposed into other style buildings? Or do you think that that's going to be just a fallen part of the market in the not-so-distant future? It's kind of a niche question, but I find that one to be interesting because when I look at different kinds of office building inventory, it's not contracting. So there are a lot of people trying to do something with this inventory. What I'm unsure of is what's the subsequent impact on how they choose to handle the inventory? I think we are seeing already some repurposing. It's tricky, I guess. I'm not in that field, but I know that some buildings are",

I think we are seeing already some repurposing. It's tricky, I guess. I'm not in that field, but I know that some buildings are easier to remake into housing. Some of the downtown areas where New York City or somewhere like that, where there's a real need for housing. It could bring some of the prices down for apartments and things. They're trying to do it and it depends on the building, I think, as to whether it's easily converted or how expensive it's going to be to convert. You see that around the country, I think, to some extent, but it's kind of case-by-case building by building what it makes sense. I think the malls are trying to repurpose to some extent because they've lost anchors and they've lost retail stores. So something recently, one mall was converting some of them all to housing. So they've actually been there all right next door to their housing. So I think you will see definitely, it's not just going to die. There'll be new uses. Obviously, industrial commercial is up and coming. I mean, as we reshore and things, there are parts of the real estate market that will actually be investible and moving up, not down.

So I know there are companies trying to bring their employees back and some have been successful doing it, and others not as much. It's a tough one. People really have learned and certainly technology supported them in terms of being able to be productive at home and not have to go through two-hour commutes. And obviously, we're dealing with in some of these inner cities now, more problems, whether it be from the migrants, whether it be from being less willing to keep people in jail. Crimes, crimes worse than it's ever been in some of these big cities. So another reason for people to work remotely. So I think that again, the trend is there. Some of it will have been flow back in the other direction, I think. So it's kind of work in progress.

It's interesting to me because from a trading standpoint, whenever I see stuff like this, I can't help but look for opportunities. And to me, that does seem like a budding opportunity. However, I do invest in commercial real estate with some partners and the rate environment right now actually kind of puts a damper on the party. Not any of us are overly excited to be the ones to try the fun stuff right now. So it's an interesting perspective. Plus, you've got an awful lot of the refinancing is in this window over the next year or two, I think. And unless rates cooperate and come down, that's going to probably create another wave of problems for real estate. So and for the banks. So it's probably early. I'd say the opportunities there might still be a couple of years off. You know, you're in a half off. So it's tempting when you see the problem and you see that, you know, you see like that say like mentioned. But I have a feeling that, you know, stepping in here, you might be catching a falling knife from a while yet.

It's it's almost yeah, that that part is a little more pronounced than I even would have imagined. But stepping away from real estate going back to markets, I've noticed a few interesting themes specifically relating to the sectors where over the past three months, we're kind of getting a a bit of a change in vanguard where if I look over the past six months, I see mostly tech leading the pack. So commercial communication services, information technology kind of standard fair. But then if I go into a month, I see comm services still up top, but then I'm also seeing energy, industrials, utilities, materials, a lot of these sectors starting to bubble up to the top. Two questions. One, is that similar to what you're seeing and two, do you think that we're going through a bit of a sector rotation, recommitting of capital here?

Yeah, I think it's all all the above. We we really have when you step back and look particularly at the SP, but also the other markets, we really have had you know six or seven weeks here of consolidation where it kind of topped out back in, I don't know, early March, late February, early March. And we've gone sideways. And again, this week or in the last week rolled over some, but basically still in a kind of a high level consolidation. So some of what you saw with the market wasn't giving up a lot, but you were rotating. So you did have some of that sector rotation. And some of that sector rotation was back into the defensive areas that had not been performing in the fourth quarter, into the early part of the first quarter, because they were defensive and the market was taking off.

Take a look at them. They're straight up. They've been great stocks for many months. And I was pushing back on that long ago, as you know, where people would say, it's not really a good quality rally. It's all the magnificent seven. It's a very narrow. That's not good. I go, look at the housing home builders, look at, you know, XLI, look at, you know, there are a lot of groups that have actually participated quite well in the last six months. And so, and by the way, in this last, say six or seven weeks, what also has happened is that the semiconductor in particular, but tech in general, that they started rolling over and consolidating their big gains. So, semis, which is about such a great run for the last 18 months led by Nvidia, but certainly microns done well and, you know, all the capital equipment companies in semis, you know, the the lab researchers and the AMATs, the KLA, A instruments, those stocks have basically been high level consolidations of late. And so, I think it looks to me like they're they're about to turn up again. So, we've had a lot of what we've had in this last month or six weeks has just been kind of correcting overboughts, consolidating",

So, what gets you interested in them at these levels? Yeah, and I haven't looked out of this week, but I think what you're seeing is higher interest rates, obviously, hits them, you know, particularly the regionals with what happened, you know, a year ago. So, you got to kind of broaden, I think, and again, I don't have charts in front of me, but I think if you broaden your perspective and look at longer charts, you may see it in the context of a group that started to come alive and then got hit with the higher rates and is consolidated those that run, but hasn't broken down.

I remember I'm pretty biased by my view, the rates are going to come down. And you know, when I look at XLF, which is the ETF for the financial stocks, not just banks, but it looks very bullish to me.

Now, going back to metals, I was actually checking out aluminum because aluminum had been hopping a little bit. What are your perspectives on metals in general? One of the questions I know everybody has for you typically is gold and silver and kind of the the relationship and comparison between those two. But I also would like to get into some of the more niche metals like you were talking about copper aluminum specifically top of mind for me, but happy to start with gold and silver. Yeah, so, you know, I'll start with the base metals first, but I think there was, and I didn't follow closely, but they did something to take out supply from Russia, you know, they're full around with this. So I think you saw some of the strength this week just simply off of that. But I think ultimately to carry on, you know, for that to have legs, I think what we're going to see here is that basically, inventories are in good shape. I know I'm copper.

Silver took a bigger hit as it typically does, but I think it's coming back from that. And I, you know, I continue to say I think gold's going to 3000 this year. Silver I think is going to 60, and maybe 75 this year. That's a huge run. Very short term, I think silver can get up into the mid-to-high 30s pretty quickly. Gold probably can get up over 2500 pretty quickly. So I think you got, you know, room to run there for sure. The miners which have lagged and everybody's frustrated by have come alive. They, you know, they had a run and then, you know, again, kind of with the metals Friday, and then early this week have given back some of those gains, but by no means have they gone back all the way or even close? And they are poised, I think, for much higher. So, you know, I think in many cases you're, you're going to be able to double and triple your money in the miners. And",

So, you know, I think in many cases you're, you're going to be able to double and triple your money in the miners. And small miners probably much more than that. So it's an area that's been a long time coming, and I've been able, waiting for this for a while, and it would start and stop. Did that start and stop several times? You know, back in 2022, from the spring of 2022 to the fall of 2022 when the equity market bottom, people should look at what the dollar did in that time. The dollar went straight up during that six months when you have to rush it. They did Ukraine and we had oil go to 130 dollars. All of that took the dollar straight up and took the miners straight down. So, you know, that was the first real kind of interruption. It was prior to that invasion. They were poised to break out and get going. And that dollar move just killed it. And since then, we've kind of been rebuilding and start to go and then it stopped and, you know, it's been up and down. And finally, in the last six months, you know, really the last probably three or four months, you've finally got them going. And I think there is so much upside. Now, when",

We've already seen a pretty big leg of this move. Do you think that there are now people trying to pile in and get caught up? Do you think that people are seeing some sort of fundamental shift in the future that will want to rotate them into gold? Yeah. Well, first of all, people mind that we had really four tries to triple a triple top and then the fourth try finally broke through. So it was between 17, 1800 and 21, 104, you know, a couple of years there where I tried to try it again and try it again and it was always turned back. So that breakout is a big deal.

You know, it's just because it was in that tight range. And, you know, Silver is so much farther behind gold. So it has to come through, you know, it's not anywhere near a long-term breakout, but it's rising above various resistant levels, resistant levels. And I think you're going to see which typically happens in a bull market for the metals that whatever gold does, Silver will outperform by quite a bit, you know, in bear markets, Silver upperformed on underperforms or gets hit harder on the downside when you're in a bull market, Silver outperforms on the upside.

In the tech sector, and I can't name names, I would love to, because there's some names there that look outstanding. Just tell me that there's big upside ahead, and it's not just semis. It's in other areas. Then in the industrials, I've already talked about what copper looks like, what steel looks like. There's a lot of upside there. The broker dealers is a big tell for me, because if they're going to go up, that means that the stock market's going up right. You're not going to have a big run in stock brokers if the market's going south. Those are for me indicators of a market that is poised for much higher and soon. I think what I would argue is you've had a, yes, the consolidation has been more than I expected, but it's, you had 120 base point drop in rates in a few months' time.

Then when I step back and look at non-treasuries, the jump bonds market, HYG, JNK, it looks poised to reverse here. It's been hit with interest rates going up, but not that hard. It's actually held up better than other aspects of the bond market. It looks to me like you can reverse here and have a nice run. That speaks to an economy that's not falling out of bed. It speaks to interest rates that are probably going to go down, not up. Then when I look at the investment rate, it's been hit along with treasuries. By the way, again, I think it looks like it's getting oversold now and ready for another move.

If I put everything I see together, what I get as a scenario that basically says the economy still has enough legs. The industrial area is the non-consumer areas that have lagged for a while. They've been dealing with trying to get inventories down and rationalize their production to what the band is out there. I think they're starting to show signs that inventories are in good shape, but they're beginning to produce again. I think the industrial side of the economy looks like it's going to be pretty good into the summer. It's not about to fall out of bed. It's actually getting stronger. When I stepped back, the consumer, I heard Bank America today talking about and they seem to have the best window on the consumer of any of the banks. They say their consumers in great shape. Larry Fink at BlackRock just came out saying that money market funds are at 9 trillion, not 6 trillion now. We hadn't heard that before. We've heard 6 trillion. You've got a lot out there.

But soft landing at worst and maybe no landing will be the narrative combined with interest rates rolling back over, dollar rolling over, inflation going back, trending downward again.

These are people who missed the whole move. I had by and large missed the move from 3,500 up to now. May have jumped in a little bit here and there, but once we went to new highs, became more bullish, but said, I'm not chasing this thing here. It's overbought. It's way, you know, it needs to correct. They've been sitting saying, you know, like it's wishful thinking, but they're entry point in their mind is 10 down, at least. If they see an SP that gave them less than 4 down and then turned around, I don't think they're going to wait very long.

Yeah, I never put a number on, but what I have said is this is a high conviction call. It's not high conviction that it's going to happen between now and June or between now and July. It's high conviction that it's going to happen in a concentrated period, whether that is three months, six months, you know, but to go 40 or 50 percent, yes, and the Russell, I'm actually where it is now, is more than 60 percent to my target. To have that all happen in less than six months is unheard of. So that's my conviction. You know, I can't pretend to know which month we tap out, but my conviction is the next several months, and it could very well be that it's mostly done by the middle of the year, or it may be that it's not done until September, October, I don't know, but my conviction is that we are in for the steepest rally in history, or what certainly steepest, broadest rally in history.

A couple of other questions for you real quick. One of them is one of the parts of your thesis I'm always interested to learn a little bit more about is the bust portion. And the things there that I'm always fascinated by, and what I try to draw the listeners attention to, I know a lot of people they cling onto the numbers that you say because they're big numbers, right? Obviously, somebody would latch onto that. But what I try to direct people to is your to use your term, the reading the tea leaves. I try to pull out the way that you think about and construct a narrative based on your breadth of experience, because guess what? The only way you get 50 years in Wall Street is by being in Wall Street for 50 years. You can't accelerate that time frame.

So leading into the bust, what are the catalysts in your view after we go through this melt-up phase, which could take however long it takes, but the thesis being it'll be a condensed period when it does start. What then rolls us over into the bust? Because one of the things we talked about previously was kind of the global economy. And right now, at least as far as I could tell, emerging countries don't look great. Let's be clear. But some of the other just global our houses seem to be doing okay here. So I'd like to know if that part of your thesis has adjusted at all, but more importantly, what are the primary catalysts once we get to this blow off top that rolls us over? Yeah, first in terms of the other countries, what I'd say is I'm not sure it's all that different from here and from the standpoint of there's a lot of fragility underneath the surface. The countries, I'll just look at Europe as an example, it's been really amazing to see that two years ago, they didn't",

The countries, I'll just look at Europe as an example, it's been really amazing to see that two years ago, they didn't know where their energy was going to come from. There was all kinds of horror stories about what that winter was going to look like after maybe a lot of the Ukraine was invaded. And they fortunately had enough stockpiled. They got through that one and then the story was next winter where they were in that problems. The costs involved for them to purchase energy elsewhere on the market when they lost the pipeline from Russia, from Ukraine was amazing to me that they were able to kind of soldier their way through that and stay above water. They traded water, but they stayed above water. Listening to Lecguard today, she contrasted the US and Europe from the standpoint of saying, yeah, we're hanging in there, but the difference is the US has a resilient consumer who spends, spends, spends, we don't have that. She said our consumption is not showing those trends. So I would take issue with those saying that the rest of the world is in pretty good shape. I think they're in worse shape than us, but they're kind of doing what we are, which is kind of muddling through. And you think that maybe",

My concern is that's not the case. This is the good side and then we turn down from here. And I would say the same thing in Canada. I'm getting this in an October, but I see on Twitter and many videos and stuff of lots of people up north saying, I can't afford to live here anymore. I don't know where to run to, but Trudeau's made such a mess of this economy. I'm dying up here. The story we hear here in the US from a lot of young people saying, I can't afford to live on my own. I have to go back home. You see in Canada, times three. So I think Canada is not in great shape. Their policies are, I think, doing harm to their consumer too. Australia, I think, is some of that.

And besides that, the ends break, you know, the young keep going lower. And so I actually, and this is not a prediction, but I wonder if we're getting close to some sort of a currency accord, like the plaza accord in 1985, where you actually coordinate a devaluation of the dollar versus these other currencies triggered by the yen, basically saying, you know, both the euro and the yen are having trouble, or struggle to, you know, not go down.

But my really, my shorthand for the bust, how we get there, it's, or how I, why I call for a bust is that we have this massive leverage, like we've never had before in the overall world system, meaning 320 trillion in global debt. And I realize a lot of this sovereign debt, that's not going to go belly up. But we got 320 trillion debt. That's, that's a, that's leverage that you don't want to have going into a weak economy. And then on top of that, you've got quadrillions and nocial value derivatives, which is massive leverage on markets. And it just means whenever the shit hits the fan, it's going to, you know, it's going to exacerbate whatever happens in a big way. So, you know, we're so far beyond the leverage we had in 2008-09, and that's why 2008-09 happened was because of massive leverage.

So, I do appreciate you diving into that last part, though, because I always like understanding a little bit more peaked behind the curtain on the bust side of things. Because, I mean, let's be honest, people, whether or not it happens to that degree, whether it happens in whatever time frame, the theory and the way that you're thinking about the problem set is still fascinating. And there's a lot of interesting points you raise out. And again, like, as you start seeing stuff like 349 times leverage, that's terrifying. And you think that exactly to your point, that is the kind of thing that can get out of hand pretty quickly. The only thing I can say is I look at this chart that looks okay is that in June of 2020, it was at 352 times. And now we're at 349. Rob, three points. That's pretty good. We're safe now, right? Safe? Yeah, yeah, right. Yeah, interestingly, I mean, you saw how fast 2020 happened. I mean, in three weeks time, the SB lost 35. It went from seemingly okay, in three weeks later, you were down 35.

    "text": "right? Safe? Yeah, yeah, right. Yeah, interestingly, I mean, you saw how fast 2020 happened. I mean, in three weeks time, the SB lost 35. It went from seemingly okay, in three weeks later, you were down 35. It just shows you we live in a world today where the speed is just can be pretty amazing. And that's what I think ultimately when it finally hits, it can hit fast, you know. But I would also say people need to remember, because this is the hardest part about all of this as an investor is the return that can come here, like I said, the Russell called for more than 60 to my target. And that's being 40 or close to 40. And that's probably more than that. So the returns that we can get here are returns you would get over several years normally that could come in three to six months time frame. And I have people that know my whole scenario and are really worried about the other side of this. And they're scared to death to be in there. And I go just know yourself because, you know, these are returns. Yes, the timeframe is that we could be in a bus by the end of this year for all I know. But the timeframe is different than the magnitude of the return. The returns are three and four years worth of returns that may come in a very short window. And if you are",

And you get back in and then find out, you know, that light at the end of the tunnel is a train coming the other way. That part always just kick. I just get such a kick out of how repeatable the mistakes, retail investors and traders make. Obviously, I chuckle as you say that because it's the stories, oldies time itself. Just it's not even like mistiming one side of the trade. It's the ability to miss time both sides almost perfectly. I get such a kick out of the way that most traders think about that stuff. So it's a good thing. It's not even just in the stock market. Think about people have construction firms. It happens cycle after cycle. You know, they they swear to themselves they're not going to get caught with inventory again. You know, they're not going to build on spec or they're not going to have land or that. And then what happens, you know, now it's the national builders. But what happens is things are so strong and they just they look like it's going to go on for a long time.

Thanks for hanging out for a little while. If there's somewhere that you want people to reach out to you, where would that be? Sure. I'm Twitter every day. So at Dave Age Contrary in I don't know if we have taken care of some of the duplicate account problems. I'm more of the fake accounts because I Twitter took it upon themselves to give me a blue chuck mark and they did that to a lot of people. I guess that are decent followings. And I don't know if that really eliminates that problem or not. But hopefully it does. I haven't seen so much of that lately. Yeah, I'll give the right link anyways. I'll throw that in the notes below. Okay. So I'm there and then I have a quarterly letter for those that want to subscribe. It's by, you know, by subscription. So there's a cost to it. If they want information, they can direct message me on Twitter and I'll give them details. Yeah, perfect. Well, David, thank you so much. Absolute blast hanging out.
