Hopefully my stuff's just jacked up. They got rid of that. That would be really frustrating. But we'll use O rats because there's his working. And if you take a look at its prior earnings, it's been a bit of a shotgun blast. It's been at the end of the ranges, pretty much most of the recent history. And it's been suffering some downside moves that are like pretty outsized. So right now it's plotting 6.9 implied. So we'll see what the actual is. That's actually a decent edge over the actual move, but I still think it might be insufficient.

But sucks for me because I don't see it. What else? So that's coming up for earnings. We also should talk about Nvidia, I think because Nvidia was like the talk of the town today. There's a bunch of stuff going on in there. We can see that it popped up on like three or four different option scans that I run. And if we take a look inside, take a look at this. For the volume on the day, 1.2 million calls against 1.16 million on the put side and it's bearish. It's like real bearish in disposition, right? 44 at the bid on the calls and 42 at the offer on the put. So and this is all, take a look at this. This is all short term. So this to me looks like some sort of sympathetic positioning to either another earnings release coming out this week that market is thinking this is going to move sympathetically",

So this to me looks like some sort of sympathetic positioning to either another earnings release coming out this week that market is thinking this is going to move sympathetically with or there might be some sort of news coming out. But let's see really quick. New AI chip for Hue. Let's see what this says. Microsoft meta app. Well, yeah, I just want to see what it talks about with Nvidia. Here we go. Shares fell in a report that Hue away technologies developed new chip called the Ascend 910D, hoping it would be more powerful than the H100. I mean, this is a pretty sad down move if that's the case, right? So the market moving like this on that news tells you exactly what it is. But I mean more broadly, this just is in a very, very clear descending pattern at the moment. And my broader expectation here, though, is like that's actually like pretty strong positioning that you see today. So I don't think that that's especially what makes me say that's because it's also short term, right? If we take a look at where most of the expiration is being traded on this call volume is, it's very, very short term. So that tells us that there is absolutely speculation going on in this front expiration, which otherwise is quiet for Nvidia, right? So",

So 661,000 call volume, 500, 8, 2000 put volume, just for a few days from now, which is quite anomalous for Nvidia outside of some sort of earnings events, earnings event, different story for sure. But that's not what they have. So let's take a look at Nvidia a little deeper here. And let's see. Yeah, look at this. So it's a massive spike in bear side, put premium. And take a look at this, like all of the high volume contracts, are super short term. It's all three days. All of the high volume contracts are literally super, super, super short term. So I mean, that leads me to believe that they're, they're positioning for something. Now, the fact that it's so even split between calls and puts makes it a little more difficult, I think, to discreetly identify what the event is and when.

The main thing at a cliff notes version is the, I think the direction, I think there's going to be a directional move. Based on the options positioning here. And if there is that directional move that I broadly would anticipate, my guess is that there would be a really short term opportunity for it. I don't think it's going to be significantly long term because of how short term these options are and when they're going to roll off. But even those options, they're going to have an impact on literally dealer positioning in order to hold the positions, right?

One of the ways we can validate that is by looking at the wall surface. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that pretty much that pretty much tells a whole story. Interesting moves in video. Another one worth talking about is micron. Micron popped up today, similar, slow of reasons, overall trading activity. But this one was slightly different in two different ways. And I'll show you how the first take a look at the expirations again, more tech. So this is another high tech facing company that doesn't itself have earnings coming up this week. But you will see a lot of very near term options being traded in it. So again, it's this sympathetic move that is being expected to hit from what I can tell the broad tech industry. It does seem to lean a little more to the chip to the chip side of the world. But this one was interesting because there was a couple pretty big positions that stuck out to me. So M U.

So there's a series of puts that came in at the bid. And then I mean, the majority of this volume though that we saw in the front expiration, these are further out in time like these bigger trades. But more of the front expiration itself, not the same sizing going on. So what I thought was slightly interesting about micron is that the trading activity that I saw in here seemed to lend itself more so to longer term positioning. Now the volume in the near term contracts is high in a total amount of volume, but it's much lower in total amount of premium being traded. So that's a natural skew that will happen when you're tracking options activity like this because you'll, if you just use volume, it can be really misleading, right? Because if you have an option that's a dollar versus an option that's 10 cents, but you buy one of each complete size disparity in terms of premium, but as soon as you buy 10 of the 10 cents, now they look the same, although they're essentially the same value.

So quite prone. That's why using things like open interest as a normalizer is really productive. And then the same thing is tracking by premiums. I also think that that's fairly productive. Futures on the open here are a little soft, but not bad. We also should talk about VIX. VIX is at one of its lowest levels since essentially the spike that we got here back at the beginning of the month. But again, it's still really elevated. And I want to make sure that that point is clear. A lot of people they look at the move up to six days. They see the move down into the mid 20s and they think, oh, wow, you know, VIX is low now. And by all accounts, it is not. And I'll show you. This is now looking out at a five year weekly. What do you notice about the price level for VIX here? I mean, it literally is over the majority of the occurrences on this chart. So if I extend this to the left, it is a really big disparity. So that's important to note because don't get caught up in this near term transition. There still is really high level clustering. It's been",

So the fact that it even had his soft of a day, it did today, but didn't actually go down lower is again, I think, quite telling. Now another thing that I do like to do is poke through VIX and see if there are big trades that came through relative to other periods. See, not really. So if we look over the last 30 days, I'll show you when we see like bigger size trades in VIX, it's like definitely north of I would call it 20 mill is when it's like a big trade. So if we look over the last month, I'm just trying to give you a little bit of context on this. So you'll see that there's a bunch that are in single digit millions. It's kind of standard for something like VIX that's traded as heavy as it is. So then when we go to today, and you see the largest trades were like five mill, obviously big gross number of dollars, but relative to VIX, what it trades is really not that much.

So what that tells us is the market is absolutely still on edge as in my opinion, it absolutely should be. There is no reason right now for the market to become complacent, not on edge. And it's because I was posting about this in the discord a little bit last night. And the conversations between us and China are fucking bizarre when it comes to tariffs. Because the US is trying to position it as if like these conversations are going well, China's sitting there like bitch, we didn't even talk. So it's like this just absolutely weird series of positioning. And it's actually getting difficult to discern from a back end perspective, like what's actually happening because there's some really, really high tariffs that are set to launch. And I think with those tariffs in place, depending on how long they stay in place for, I mean, it can literally be absolutely destructive on a global scale. So this is a game of chicken.

I don't feel like I could trust what China is saying. So then I'm kind of like, I have no fucking idea how these conversations are going. Now taking that back to markets, I do believe that the markets tend to be pretty damn smart, way smarter than all ever be. And I can see artifacts in the broader positioning that the market is obviously still registering a significant amount of volatility again for context. If we look over the last five years, the average price, best fit is about 15 and a half. We're 10 points higher than that. That's a massive difference. So even though VIX is coming down, the VIX is not low enough and it's still absolutely elevated here. So cliff notes for all of that is don't let this deceive you because it can be deceptive. I've seen it literally. There was a person that was messaging me earlier asking one of my friends asking about VIX and asking why it was quote unquote so low.

Well, I think that really is super dependent on what you're doing as a trader, like what matters versus what doesn't matter. Now for somebody like me, I use a lot of stuff. I use options as a way to view everything. So there's never a point in time where let's say for example, Tesla. Tesla is a great example because of where it's at. My personal opinion on Tesla is longer term, bullish, near term, really have no idea. And I think it's a little bit oversold, but I do think that the valuation here isn't crazy. I think it actually kind of makes sense. So when I'm analyzing something like Tesla, I have my baked in qualitative ideas based on just the overall amount of information that I ingest from across places.

This is literally how we dissected straight up all of his trades is by using tools like this to understand broader positioning. I do like to use these two other tools for slightly different reasons. The net flow just ties in a couple broader things that we're looking at. So for example, UPS. Like we were looking at before. What I can do is in one spot get a sense of what's happening writ large and then to get a sense of positioning. Now I generally will just go down to the ticker explorer and then I'll plug it in there so I can run through everything. And what I mean by everything is essentially all the tools in here.

But this gives you a look at some things that's really difficult to find other places. The historical data and stuff like that I don't really care about. But this stuff is really useful. Understanding dealer positioning. So Gax, Charm, Vanna, that kind of stuff. So yeah, I mean that's like a quick lift notes version of just running through it at a high level. I also use this for stuff like sector flows. But the world of dealer positioning is really interesting because it can give you a lot of near term insight on how things might move in the short term. So that's things like Gax, Charm, Vanna. And you can definitely trade dealer positioning if it's big enough based on those. And you literally can, it's one of the few things that like you can actually forecast pretty well because you can see it and you can see how it's changing. But it's difficult because it's not a static figure. What that means is let's say that you have some sort of Gax level that looks really interesting to you. And it's not a closed system. So as dealers might be repositioning based on the current Gax levels, then there can be a bunch of new trades that come in for some other reason that then interface with the system differently.

But you can make money off of it. But it's again, it's like all this other stuff I literally made a video earlier today talking about this. A lot of traders get into options trading thinking that if you trade options, you now have an edge. And it's not literally is not the case at all. It's actually way more complex to develop an edge in options trading as compared to equities. But there are just more available to you. So that click that in one level it applies here. Like if you learn about the concepts of dealer positioning, Gax, again, Charm, Vanna, then you have some ideas, but knowing them, seeing them and inherently doesn't yield some sort of edge, but you can monitor the behavior and then use that to derive at least some ideas.

So back to the cop report, we talked about this yesterday on the pro stream, but worth reiterating here for sure. The main thing I want to highlight is this green line large speculators, not fucking buying it. What I mean by that is this dip as it's been dipping large speculators have been off low. And they you can call them smarter, Dumber, whatever you want, but they tend to be pretty decent with their overall positioning and timing as they're lightning their trades and whatnot. So the COT reports really good for that. I've actually done a couple sponsored videos for bar chart on their channel about the COT report.

It's based on a multi factor analysis, but to give you the main thing that I care about when I'm considering this is this here. What is the larger range that I've seen occur previously in terms of price? So we've seen price essentially go from here to here.

So then that means what if we postulates T triple Q's down to 10? Well now that's an 89 move. That becomes a better planning factor. So when I'm thinking about the planning factor for the moves and then the subsequent scaling, I'm intending to use right now, I have essentially 75 of the position tied up in this just top region, which is a drop in the bucket in terms of this dropping all the way down to 10. Now this goes into another conversation about this idea of units and using that to scale in. That's a whole other thing. But somewhere has all that up to say little too much out here right now.

So then what I can do is I can figure out the difference between these two numbers, figure out what essentially need the option to trade at. So all I need to do is take this minus this and it gives me 382. And we already know what the starting premium was and we know how many contracts the contracts is already normalized because we're using the total P and L. So I don't have to adjust by the contracts. So really all I need to do now is take this down by the total trade size. So I pretty much need this to be trading for like 38 cents in order for me to make the total amount of money that I need to pull out on these. So then to eyeball that, if I take these down for 0.38, that'll give me the 49.50 that I need here, which again, that's essentially how all of that will bubble out to being this a highly successful position. Now that all being said, that doesn't necessarily mean that I won't adjust these. There's a good chance I will, but right now it's just way too early to even think about that.

There's a good chance I will, but right now it's just way too early to even think about that. However, I do have to be kind of quick and not allow these to get buried if I can. So right now, that's why I'm a little itchy because I'm exposed and I'm exposed because these were a little too far out in time. Notice if I wanted to roll these, this is that idea that I talk about with respect to expiration liquidity. I'm in these 53 DTE. If I go out the next one, I'm literally doubling and change how much time is in the trade. So I run out of rolling choices if something happens during again, this near term window. So there's kind of a sit and wait and see what happens. I can roll them out to 19 set, but I wouldn't want to. If I have to, it's something I consider, but absolutely not something that I want to do. Now let's talk about one other thing really quick. I have a couple other trades will go through these a little more in detail tomorrow, but there's a couple broad market themes that I'm continuing to see play out that I do think are tradable. So one of those themes is reiterating from what we talked about yesterday, the relationship between comm services and tech is still not normalized.",

If you take a look, they're almost inversing in terms of how they're performing on the day relative to one another. I traded that today. It actually worked pretty well. It's just trading the expansion between the pair's relationship. Energy is on this really slow steady grind. So there's a couple names in energy that have been performing really leading the total pack here. And I will show you those. So if we get out of the COT report and let's take a look at this one, let's go to energy. So if we take a look at the five day performance in energy, you can see really who the main leaders are in the broader index. And again, EQT, we have talked about EQT. It's got to be a dozen times now. So the reason why I'm mentioning that is because the market, it becomes not like super predictable, but it's like this is a novel to me. The fact that EQT is up is not surprising at all. And if you'll recall, the trade that I talked about running in EQT was short puts.

And it's simply because through earnings, it tends to have an inside move, but it's been bullish overall directionally. EQT has been very slow grinding to the upside. Now it's at a delicate spot here with it being at 51. It needs to break above this in order to see a resumption of this uptrend before I would expect it to roll back over. So the short puts that I have out that I essentially traded through earnings, I'm just holding those. And I had two different tranches. The specific earnings plays didn't play anything for that. And it's because EQT can move a bit much. I don't remember what our set analysis was on it. I might have actually might have traded EQT for earnings. I don't remember. I'd have to look at the log, but there was definitely a longer term trade component to it. And it's because it's providing a slight keyhole stabilizing force for the broader portfolio, which is really heavy in these other names. And there's another trade that I'm doing that with two of them actually give you one of them for you here. So new one. This is another one.

Now new month is been a little bit of a favor simply because of the risk off environment that we keep rotating in and out of. Now it's starting to slow down. So this might actually be ready to come down. I had some long calls and short puts in these. So sort of a synthetic long scenario, but I treat them slightly differently. The long calls are like a small loss at this point. The short puts are still fine. So these might have to come down if it continues this broader trend, but this is again adding this to the portfolio because it's the kind of name that's doing something on its own, meaning it's providing some bullish price movement, but also because of the way that it fits into the portfolio. So the portfolio itself is still long beta-weighted delta's broadly. So that's broadly what I got for you guys. Now is a great time.

If one of the reasons why I'm so disinterested in getting involved in just public service is because how much it skylines you, how gritty it is, and how awful the compensation is. You make no money. So the fact that we look at people like this and we just look at them and we're upset. We're like, oh, they shouldn't be able to do this. This is bullshit. They shouldn't have this much money.

And regardless of whether you like Pelosi, don't like Pelosi or these other people, like they're still intelligent. So in order to get intelligent people into these kinds of jobs, you also have to think, well, what's in it for them, which is really, really difficult.

I think a lot of the people that otherwise might be interested in these kinds of jobs. But I think being able to trade individual names is fucking crazy. And it's because they're way too close to stuff that they would hear that might be public, but they're still going to hear it well before. Well, well before other people will. So yeah, now one other thing that is worth noting whenever we talk about Pelosi is Pelosi is not the one that's actually trading. Her husband is a professional investor and he's done that his whole life. So there is also that dynamic here where although we really like to make the joke from the angle of, oh, it's Pelosi trading, it's really not it's her husband who's already a professional investor. So there's also that one's. But yeah, this I think is hilarious. Let's see. We introduced Pelosi act to ban lawmakers and spouses from trading individual names. Named after Nancy Pelosi, the bills gain support from both parties, including Trump, referees, amid ongoing scrutiny. Of congressional stock trading. Yeah. I mean, honestly, I don't like the name. Oh my God. I did not realize this. Look at this preventing elected leaders from owning securities and investments. They literally, I didn't know that they made it a fucking acronym.

I think there's a lot of other people that are doing this. She just started getting a lot of press because of her, her level within government. So I don't like it making it out where it's like a Pelosi problem like this is much broader than just Pelosi. But the troll in that acronym is S tier. So I don't even know how you could be upset at that. It's so funny. Would prohibit lawmakers and spouses from holding, buying or selling individual stocks while on office? Would allow investments in mutual funds and ETFs or bonds? Yeah. I think that's okay. They would have up to 180 days to divest that kind of sucks to be honest.

I mean, looking the discord. You said it was at 940. No, I don't see it unless you posted it in a different room. Yeah, I don't see anything in here about Burke. I don't know why it would have been deleted though. The bot might not have done it. But yeah, anyways, I would decouple especially from like the retail trader lens because spoofing is really a game between other firms, other high frequency trading firms typically not relegated to them, but it's very frequently between other HFTs and market making firms. So I think the connection of pushing retailers into the exit liquidity is not necessarily applicable. Why they do it in general. I think you're answering your own question in terms of getting some sort of liquidity. Check this option Shane 5 to Burke be 560 calls very weird at 940. What are we going to check though?

I haven't really used this much. Yeah, I mean, there's no, there's nothing here that lets me actually see that. Now, Mateo, what otherwise are you talking about me checking? I'm trying to think like the way that you're thinking that you detected spoofing. Because from a retail trade or a lens, there's only a couple things that we could potentially do. But I'm wondering how you're thinking about it. I'm thinking. Nada. Okay, well anyways, I'll continue on the we can talk about it in two different lenses. is the first lens is the concept of spoofing. But then the second being some sort of behavior in Birkbee, I think the behavior in Birkbee doesn't... Let's look at Birkbee broadly first before I say the... Okay. I mean, net premiums really weren't that much. Calls ran fairly negative, but not like tremendously put side was pretty mellow. The three days that you're talking about seem to have had some activity. The same thing with the five forties. I wonder if one of those was sold for a spread. No, because it's only 13k against 1800.

You might have a close group who load up buys before they share the play. You tell him about this in Birkshire? Who we talking about? When you say pushing his followers, who's his? I'm not sure. Because that is completely different. That starts to sound more like pump and dump. But I mean, to do any sort of pump and dump and something like Birkshire is fucking... crazy. Because the kind of scale that you would need. And I would also then completely decouple that from spoofing. It seems like you might be confusing what that is compared to the other thing you're talking about here. Spoofing is layering orders in an order book to provide false appearance and manipulate the appearance of supply and demand functionality in the markets, which is why like using anything like this, we can't see it. Because the way that you would monitor spoofing is two different ways. If you go to enter an order and then it moves before you get a fill and then you enter an order and then it moves.

If you go to enter an order and then it moves before you get a fill and then you enter an order and then it moves. Those are orders that are completely designed to be pulled before they're filled, which is annoying. But you'll run into that even as an options trader, retail options trader. It's not always spoofing. But sometimes there's just a stale order that's sitting there that when it goes to get hit, it'll move. Mateo says it's a Twitter handle that's doing it. Let's go see... I've never heard of this person. It's 77,000 followers. There's no way that they're doing this. Yeah, I think you're confusing a bunch of things. So the first thing is that person is way too small to even attempt a pump and dump on something like Berkshire Hathaway. Berkshire Hathaway is huge. In order to run a successful pump and dump, you really have to be able to control way, way, way more of the volume. Because that's essentially how you create your own wave to get out. When you're trading really, really big names like that, it's next to impossible because there's so many other entities trading at such larger sizes than any one individual that...

Let's take a look at the 560s only. And we said it was for the second. I mean, they literally don't even register here. These are 4,000. I mean, there's nothing happening here.

You're confusing the way that options are traded. I think thinking too much about how a small float stock might be traded.

It's not going to be directly paired, you know, retail trader, the group whoever they are, the group is needing to exit their calls. So then they need somebody to buy them from them as they sell them. That's clearly not what's going on here. The other cases they're obviously buying. So while they're going through that buying activity, you need somebody to sell them to you. The probability of retail traders sitting there resting orders to sell these calls to this other group is probably very little. So the broader thing is I think you're confusing a few different things. I think you're confusing spoofing. I think you're confusing pump and dumps how they work. I think you're detecting a broader thing that seems off to you, which is completely fair. Again, I don't know anything about them.

It's this is even a much larger magnitude version of what you just showed me. And again, I can show you hundreds of these because again, this is how options trade. Anytime you look for volume over OI, that is where the volume on that day for some reason explodes in a specific contract. It doesn't have to explode. It could be a little bit. But typically the scenarios we're talking about is more severe than that. And it's for a trade being built for one reason or another.

    "text": "for one reason or another. Again, like this is a prime time example where this trade here shows you cores ended up having 10,000 contract volume on this one specific time frame, 1241 to 1242. So it's really to me, I think it's a little more telling when there's got to be other behaviors. The only thing you're detecting is a spike in volume. That's all that means. So what the spike in volume means where it comes from all that kind of stuff, it's a completely different thing. But if you take a look at the candle volume, on this one, it's literally 2400 contracts. It's tiny actually compared to what you see here. This is 2400 contracts spike. Again, this is 10,000 spike. So all you're seeing is a spike in volume. You can't really pull more from it from that without more information. And just to remind everybody, the concept of spoofing is very different as well. Spoofing is done at the institutional level. And it's like mixed with like order stuffing and things like this to to manipulate the appearance of supply and demand functions in the market. So Mattel, you're probably just picking up on like sus behavior general based on the person that you're talking about. And it could be valid invalid, but you just can't prove anything from that thing there specifically. There's really not much to see. That being said, you should always follow your gut, right?

But that's generally what I'm seeing there is just a whole bunch of not much. All right, gang. That Mattel says seems like a pump and dump. Yeah, I don't see that. I don't think you could call it even a pump and dump because again, the position that was built is still held right now. It's you're not going to be able to run a pump and dump in that because it's an option. And again, the counter party to his trade is going to be a market maker. Yeah, like that's such an important concept to understand. And the other thing is the value of those contracts is not going to be determined by their buying and selling behavior. One, because it's tiny, their buying and selling behavior is secondary largely to the movement of the underlying. So the concept again of a pump and dump is to be able to control the underlying because that's how then you buy shares cheaper. And your buying volume is great enough that it starts showing the appearance of broader interest in this underlying, whatever that is. And",

And your buying volume is great enough that it starts showing the appearance of broader interest in this underlying, whatever that is. And then you start selling into the follow on entry volume. This is for a small float stock. In a big name like Birkshar Halfaway, they're buying literally doesn't matter because the underlying is still going to be the dominant force. Now, sometimes the tail can wag the dog, meaning if there's enough options activity, like I was talking about earlier in the stream, it can necessitate certain dealer behavior in terms of hedging activities. But even that, it requires such an insane scale, especially in something like Birkshar Halfaway. Again, like the total premium that we looked at in this options chain, in this specific one that we're talking about in Birkbee, the total premium is 413,000. The total premium that traded today in Birkshar Halfaway, the total premium is over 30 million. This is nothing. And that 30 million itself still won't move the underlying itself, which if we take a look at what the volume weighted average was here, it's 4.2 million shares. So 4238653 times the current price of 53094. So the total amount of money that traded today in Birkshar Halfaway is 2.25 billion. So the entire options activity today is completely inconsequential.

Mateo says I saw the contract spike from 10 to 41 without the underlying going up. That's different. What you saw was the contract moving largely due to supply and demand changes, but then also liquidity changes. So the value of that contract, the only reason why it would move between 10 and 41 would be as if there's really false orders resting there that aren't trading, right? So you can see that it didn't actually trade at 10 cents. It was rested at 10 cents, but that's not where people were actually trading at. Then you can see when that volume spikes here, the volume spikes, I wish there was a way to make this one chart a little bigger. I feel like there's got to be a way to do that. That's okay. So you can see the volume, right? The average fill is this yellow line. The average fill that happened today was here in the mid-20s. The cheapest fill that it got on the day was it looks like a one lot. I can't even hover on it. 12 cents on an eight lot. So the reason why you see that volume or the average, the price going up",

So the reason why you see that volume or the average, the price going up is because that's the market maker looking at the order flow that's coming in and they're charging them a premium. Because what's happening is the market maker doesn't want to be stuck on one side of the order flow. So they continue to adjust their books. They move the bid in the ask and they change what kind of depth they order sizing. So they make it more expensive to continue buying. That's not the price going up. That's not the value of the contracts going up. Again, you can see what the overall value of the contracts ultimately terminated around, which is where it essentially started the day at. The 20 handle, 20 cents, 23 cents, something like that. So this is the market makers just causing increasing how much money they're forcing the follow-on trades to be executed at. But all of these, again, there's no big effect because in terms of the impact of the underlying, but then also the impact to the individual traders because the counter-party to these is going to be a market maker.

They're not providing the exit liquidity for them. The market makers would be providing the exit liquidity for them. So, yeah, is what it is. But anyways, about time for me to wrap up.
