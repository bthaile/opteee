I think I wrote a bit. Oh, that's frustrating AF. What the... Devastation. So if any of you have thinkorswim, can one of you pop on and see if under the Analyze tab if earnings is in there? Is that looks like super gone? I don't see it on anything. That's super frustrating. I hope they didn't get rid of that. Maybe it's just a penning update or something. Hopefully my stuff's just jacked up. They got rid of that. That would be really frustrating. But we'll use O rats because theirs is working. And if you take a look at its prior earnings, it's been a bit of a shotgun blast. It's been at the end of the ranges, pretty much most of the recent history. And it's been suffering some downside moves that are like pretty outsized. So right now it's plotting 6.9 implied. So we'll see what the actual is. That's actually a decent edge over the actual move, but I still think it might be insufficient. The way that I'm screening for earnings plays this time is actually... Tommy says, I have earnings in Analyze tab. What the hell? Where's mine? Yeah, they did me dirty. I might have to reset my thing or",

So thank you for confirming Tommy. But sucks for me because I don't see it. What else? So that's coming up for earnings. We also should talk about Nvidia, I think, because Nvidia was... Like the talk of the town today. There's a bunch of stuff going on in there. We can see that it popped up on like three or four different options scans that I run. And if we take a look inside, take a look at this. For the volume on the day, 1.2 million calls against 1.16 million on the put side and it's bearish. It's like real bearish in disposition, right? 44 at the bid on the calls and 42 at the offer on the put. So... And this is all... Take a look at this. This is all short term. So this, to me, looks like some sort of sympathetic positioning to either another earnings release coming out this week that market is thinking this is going to move sympathetically with. Or there might be some sort of news coming out. But let's see",

Yeah, I just want to see what it talks about with Nvidia. Here we go. Cheers. Fell in a report that Hue away technologies developed new chip called the Ascend 910D, hoping it would be more powerful than the H100. I mean, this is a pretty sad down move if that's the case, right? So the market moving like this on that news tells you exactly what it is. But I mean, more broadly, this just is in a very, very clear descending pattern at the moment. And my broader expectation here, though, is like that's actually like pretty strong positioning that you see today. So I don't think that that's especially what makes me say that's because it's also short term, right? If we take a look at where most of the expiration is being traded on this call volume is, it's very, very short term. So that tells us that there is absolutely speculation going on in this front expiration, which otherwise is quiet for Nvidia, right? So 661,000 call volume, 5008, 2000 put volume, just for a few days from now, which",

But that's not what they have. So let's take a look at Nvidia a little deeper here. And let's see. Yeah, look at this. So it's a massive spike in bear's side put premium and take a look at this like all of the high volume contracts are super short term. It's all three days. All of the high volume contracts are literally super, super, super short term. So I mean, that leads me to believe that they're positioning for something. Now the fact that it's so even split between calls and puts makes it a little more difficult, I think to discreetly identify what the event is and when. But this has been just an interesting watch, something to put on your radar for me. I'll kind of make a post about it in the discord for the pro members because there's a couple of ways I think you can go about it. But this is something I would look to trade.

The main thing at a cliff notes version is the direct, I think the direction, I think there's going to be a directional move based on the options positioning here. And if there is that directional move that I broadly would anticipate, my guess is that there would be a really short term opportunity for it. I don't think it's going to be significantly long term because of how short term these options are and when they're going to roll off. But even those options, they're going to have an impact on literally dealer positioning in order to hold the positions, right? So that activity that you saw today is absolutely going to have an impact on total gamma, on charm and vanna. Really charm is going to matter more in this instance than vanna because of how short term these options are. But yeah, I mean, what is this the one tens? So this thing can go haywire. It's just a ton. Now they call input gamma about balances out here. There's not like a massive imbalance, but just outside the money to the north, it does, which would be surprising.

But based on the fairly bearish positioning today would lead me to believe stronger potential for downside. One of the ways we can validate that is by looking at the wall surface. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that pretty much that pretty much tells a whole story. Interesting moves in video. Another one worth talking about is micron. Micron popped up today, similar, slow of reasons, overall trading activity. But this one was slightly different in two different ways. And I'll show you how. The first take a look at the explorations again, more tech. So this is another high tech facing company that doesn't itself have earnings coming up this week. But you will see a lot of very near term options being traded in it. So again, it's this sympathetic move that is being expected to hit from what I can tell. The broad tech industry, it does seem to lean a little more to the chip to the chip side of the world. But this one was interesting because there was a couple pretty big positions that stuck out to me. So M U. Let's go to today. Here. Make sure everything else is turned off.

And then I mean, the majority of this volume though that we saw in the front expiration, these are further out in time, like these bigger trades. But more of the front expiration itself. Not the same sizing going on. So what I thought was slightly interesting about micron is that the trading activity that I saw in here seemed to lend itself more so to longer term positioning. Now the volume in the near term contracts is high in a total amount of volume, but it's much lower in total amount of premium being traded. So that's a natural skew that will happen when you're tracking options activity like this. If you just use volume, it can be really misleading, right? Because if you have an option, that's a dollar versus an option that's 10 cents, but you buy one of each complete size disparity in terms of premium, but as soon as you buy 10 of the 10 cents, now they look the same, although they're essentially the same value.

Futures on the open here are a little soft, but not bad. We also should talk about VIX. VIX is at one of its lowest levels since essentially the spike that we've got. We got here back at the beginning of the month, but again, it's still really elevated. And I want to make sure that that point is clear. A lot of people they look at the move up to six days. They see the move down into the mid 20s and they think, oh, wow, VIX is low now. And by all accounts, it is not. And I'll show you. This is now looking out at a five year weekly. What do you notice about the price level for VIX here? I mean, it literally is over the majority of the occurrences on this chart. So if I extend this to the left, it is really big disparities. So that's important to note because don't get caught up in this near term transition. There still is really high level clustering. It's been clustering above 25 essentially for like a month.

Now another thing that I do like to do is poke through VIX and see if there are big trades that came through relative to other periods. Let's see. Not really. So if we look over the last 30 days, I'll show you. When we see like bigger size trades in VIX, it's like definitely north of I would call it 20 mil is when it's like a big trade. So if we look over the last month, I'm just trying to give you a little bit of context on this. So you'll see that there's a bunch that are in single digit millions. It's kind of standard for something like VIX that's traded as heavy as it is. So then when we go to today and you see the largest trades were like five mil obviously big gross number of dollars, but relative to VIX, what it trades is really not that much. So this qualifies actually is a pretty quiet period for VIX. So the fact that it had this quiet of a period and still didn't fall down lower is",

So what that tells us is the market is absolutely still on edge as in my opinion, it absolutely should be. There is no reason right now for the market to become complacent, not on edge. And it's because I was posting about this in the discord a little bit last night. And the conversations between us and China are fucking bizarre when it comes to tariffs. Because the US is trying to position it as if like these conversations are going well, China's sitting there like bitch, we didn't even talk. So it's like this just absolutely weird series of positioning and it's actually getting difficult to discern from a backend perspective like what's actually happening because there's some really, really high tariffs that are set to launch. And I think with those tariffs in place, depending on how long they stay in place for, I mean, it can literally be absolutely destructive on a global scale. So this is a game of chicken. We are trying to see who's going to blink first, but it's hard to tell who's blinking when because of the way that I literally, I don't feel like I can trust what",

Now taking that back to markets, I do believe that the markets tend to be pretty damn smart, very smarter than all ever be. And I can see artifacts in the broader positioning that the market is obviously still registering a significant amount of volatility again for context. If we look over the last five years, the average price best fit is about 15 and a half. We're 10 points higher than that. That's a massive difference. So even though VIX is coming down, the VIX is not low enough and it's still absolutely elevated here. So cliff notes for all of that is don't let this deceive you because it can be deceptive. I've seen it literally. There was a person that was messaging me earlier asking one of my friends asking about VIX and asking why it was quote unquote so low.

Well, I think that really is super dependent on what you're doing as a trader, like what matters versus what doesn't matter. Now for somebody like me, I use a lot of stuff. I use options as a way to view everything. So there's never a point in time where let's say for example Tesla, Tesla is a great example because of where it's at. My personal opinion on Tesla is longer term, bullish, near term, really have no idea. And I think it's a little bit oversold, but I do think that the valuation here isn't crazy. I think it actually kind of makes sense. So when I'm analyzing something like Tesla, I have my baked in qualitative ideas based on just the overall amount of information that I ingest from across places. But then when I'm trying to figure out the behavior or potential positioning or movements to come up with different trade ideas, that's when different tools specifically offered by unusual whales, which full disclosure, I am an affiliate for there.

What I can do is in one spot, get a sense of what's happening writ large and then to get a sense of positioning. Now I generally will just go down to the ticker explorer and then I'll plug it in there so I can run through everything. And what I mean by everything is essentially all the tools in here, I use two degrees. There's a couple that I don't care about. I actually haven't turned off. I forgot where the little tool is. There's a tool that lets you customize what's on this. But there's a couple things that I don't really care about. But this gives you a look at some things that's really difficult to find other places, the historical data and stuff like that. I don't really care about. But this stuff is really useful. Understanding dealer positioning. So Gax, Charm, Vanna, that kind of stuff. So yeah,",

So yeah, I mean, that's like a quick lift notes version of just running through it at a high level. I also use this for stuff like sector flows. But the world of dealer positioning is really interesting because it can give you a lot of near-term insight on how things might move in the short term. So that's things like Gax, Charm, Vanna. And you can definitely trade dealer positioning if it's big enough based on those. And you literally can, it's one of the few things that like you can actually forecast pretty well because you can see it. And you can see how it's changing. But it's difficult because it's not a static figure. What that means is let's say that you have some sort of Gax level that looks really interesting to you. And it's not a closed system. So as dealers might be repositioning based on the current Gax levels, then there can be a bunch of new trades that come in for some other reason that then interface with the system differently. So I always throw that out because a lot of people, when they start learning about Gax, Charm, Vanna, really the impact at the",

I think they start to think that they're really latching on to something that has some real meat to it that you can pull a lot off of with in terms of just profit. But you can make money off of it. But it's again, it's like all this other stuff I literally made a video earlier today talking about this. A lot of traders get into options trading thinking that if you trade options, you now have an edge. And it's not literally, it's not the case at all. It's actually way more complex to develop an edge in options trading as compared to equities. But there are just more available to you. So that, click that in one level. It applies here. If you learn about the concepts of dealer positioning, Gax, again, Charm, Vanna, then you have some ideas, but knowing them, seeing them and inherently doesn't yield some sort of edge, but you can monitor the behavior and then use that to derive at least some ideas.

We talked about this yesterday on the pro stream, but worth reiterating here for sure. The main thing I want to highlight is this green line large speculators, not fucking buying it. What I mean by that is this dip as it's been dipping large speculators have been off loading. And they you can call them smarter, dumber, whatever you want, but they tend to be pretty decent with their overall positioning and timing as they're lightening their trades and whatnot. So the COT reports really good for that. I've actually done a couple sponsored videos for bar chart on their channel about the COT report. And I think this I wanted to validate because I was very curious how they would be viewing this. And when you start overlaying these different things that we talk about, you overlay the fact that VIX is still at 25, although the market is moderately rebounding. You overlay the fact that we saw a lot of negative leaning options activity and something like Nvidia. You overlay the fact that we poke at the COT",

So like you start stacking those and it gives you again, not with any degree of certainty, but gives you some ideas as to what might be going on in the broader market. And again, it's whatever I've already shared with you. It seems like the market continues to remain in a pretty volatile place, quite tenuous as far as I can see. And largely it doesn't look like institutions are buying this recovery much at all, which leads into a lot actually about how I've been trading my positions, specifically the core allocation, the coverage strangle that I've been talking to you all about in SSO and T-Triple Q. So I'll throw a link to that in the chat for you to check out at your own leisure. But I've been making a ton of near term adjustments capitalizing on the price behavior as it sits.

And rename this one. Okay. So it didn't copy it. Yeah, it looks like essentially no change from what we talked about it last, but I'll show you what I'm talking about.

If this was 75 invested with this 10 lot way further out of the money, then I'm cool with that. And the way that I come up with how much I would like to be using at a given point in time is you all know is actually kind of complex. It's based on a multi factor analysis, but to give you the main thing that I care about when I'm considering this is this here. What is the larger range that I've seen occur previously in terms of price? So we've seen price essentially go from here to here. And if we eyeball what that is, it's 83.5, 82.5, whatever you want to call it. But it's about a 83 84 move. So what that means is I also want to make sure that I'm tracking where that might manifest again, because if we take a look from 93 down to 20, that's only 78.5 move. So that's insufficient.

So when I'm thinking about the planning factor for the moves and then the subsequent scaling, I'm intending to use. Right now I have essentially 75 of the position tied up in this just top region, which is a drop in the bucket in terms of this dropping all the way down to 10. Now this goes into another conversation about this idea of units and using that to scale in. That's a whole other thing. But somewhere has all that up to say little too much out here right now. So this adjustment was fantastic though. And the reason why this adjustment is fantastic is because it's the first time I was actually able to take some of the short puts out of being in the money. And there's a tranche now that is at least seeing some daylight. But I think that the move that we're having right now again is still not super strong. And seeing all of that broader negative positioning leads me to believe that it might not be in all two short order that my position might be underwater again, specifically the 52s.

These are right on the dance floor. So the funny thing about this whole story is I essentially I'll show you how I figure out what I need these to trade at but I essentially need them to trade real real cheap.

So I pretty much need this to be trading for like 38 cents in order for me to make the total amount of money that I need to pull out on these. So then to eyeball that if I take these down for 0.38 that will give me the 49 50 that I need here, which again, that's essentially how all of that will bubble out to being this a highly successful position.

I have a couple other trades will go through these a little more in detail tomorrow, but there's a couple broad market themes that I'm continuing to see play out that I do think are tradable.

It's just trading the expansion between the pairs relationship. Energy is on this really slow steady grind. So there's a couple names in energy that have been performing really leading the total pack here. And I will show you those. So if we get out of the COT report and let's take a look at this one, let's go to energy. So if we take a look at the five day performance in energy, you can see really who the main leaders are in the broader index. And again, EQT, we have talked about EQT. It's got to be a dozen times now. So the reason why I'm mentioning that is because the market, it becomes not like super predictable, but it's like this is a novel to me. The fact that EQT is up is not surprising at all. And if you'll recall, the trade that I talked about running in EQT was short puts. And it's simply because through earnings, it tends to have an inside move, but it's been bullish overall directionally. EQT has been very slow grinding to the upside.",

Now it's at a delicate spot here with it being at 51. It needs to break above this in order to see a resumption of this uptrend before I would expect it to roll back over. So the short puts that I have out that I essentially traded through earnings, I'm just holding those. And I had two different tranches. The specific earnings plays didn't play anything for that. And it's because EQT can move a bit much. I don't remember what our set analysis was on it. Oh, I might have, I actually might have traded EQT for earnings. I don't remember, I'd have to look at the log, but there was definitely a longer term trade component to it. And it's because it's providing a slight keel, stabilizing force for the broader portfolio, which is really heavy in these other names. And there's another trade that I'm doing that with two of them, actually. Give you one of them for you here. So new one. This is another one.

So this might actually be ready to come down. I had some long calls and short puts in these. So sort of a synthetic long scenario, but I treat them slightly differently. And the long calls are like a small loss at this point. The short puts are still fine. So these might have to come down if it continues this broader trend. But this is again, adding this to the portfolio because it's the kind of name that's doing something on its own, meaning it's providing some bullish price movement, but also because of the way that it fits into the portfolio. So the portfolio itself is still long beta-weighted delta's broadly. So that's broadly what I got for you guys. Now is a great time. If there's anything you want to take a look at together, if you have any questions or anything like that that you want to discuss, let me know. I'm going to pop the door for Thor real quick and then I'll hit whatever you want. He's thinking it's his dinner time, but Mel's not here and I'm not going to feed him just yet.

What happened? What happened to Pelosi? Let's see. I saw that Trump said that he would be cool with banning trading for them. Let's see. Oh my God. I see the troll now. The Pelosi act. That's so. Oh, that's classic. That's absolutely classic. Yeah. This is good. This needs to happen. The fact that there's individual Senate, Congress, whatever, like any of those entities should not be allowed to trade individual names. They're way too close to way too much information that is absolutely not accessible otherwise. And I also think it's tricky, right? We've talked about this before. The people that don't have money, they look at this with disgust, contempt, and then they get upset at them. And I understand that perspective because there's a point where I had no money. Now with money, my perspective has changed. I still think they shouldn't be allowed to trade individual names because it sets a terrible precedent and it sets an absolutely abysmal baseline for how the general population views them. However, there is a reality. You have to look at things also from their lens.",

If one of the reasons why I'm so disinterested in getting involved in just public service is because how much it skylines you, how gritty it is, and how awful the compensation is, you make no money. So the fact that we look at people like this and we just look at them and we're upset. We're like, oh, they shouldn't be able to do this. This is bullshit. They shouldn't have this much money. But then there's the other side of it as, well, I don't want fucking stupid people working in these jobs either. And regardless of whether you like Pelosi, don't like Pelosi or these other people, like they're still intelligent. So in order to get intelligent people into these kinds of jobs, you also have to think, well, what's in it for them, which is really, really difficult. Now again, this is why I don't think a ban on investing at all should be allowed because otherwise it just defeats.

So yeah, now one other thing that is worth noting whenever we talk about Pelosi is Pelosi is not the one that's actually trading. Her husband is a professional investor and he's done that his whole life. So there is also that dynamic here where although we really like to make the joke from the angle of, oh, it's Pelosi trading, it's really not it's her husband who's already a professional investor. So there's also that one's. But yeah, this I think is hilarious. Let's see. We introduced Pelosi act to ban lawmakers and spouses from trading individual names. Named after Nancy Pelosi, the bills gain support from both parties, including Trump, referees, amid ongoing scrutiny. Of congressional stock trading. Yeah. I mean, honestly, I don't like the name.

Would prohibit lawmakers and spouses from holding, buying or selling individual stocks while on office. Would allow investments in mutual funds, ETFs or bonds. Yeah. I think that's okay. They would have up to 180 days to divest that kind of sucks to be honest. I don't hate it, but there is just the timing component of when they happen to get in. So I don't love that.

I'm wondering if that's the broader angle that they're taking here because I mean, 10 of each unlawful transaction and forfeit profits to the treasury. I guess if they have to forfeit all profits, but I don't know, it just doesn't seem like that punitive. I guess maybe if they have to forfeit all profits, I kind of miss right over that one. I like that a little better. Still don't love it, but to me, it should be the kind of thing where like if you choose to do this, you literally should be kicked out.

Mateo says was my comment deleted about bid spoofing Burke B at 940 on the 560 contracts, trying to understand how these guys push retailers into their exit liquidity and why they do it. Those are different things. Bid spoofing and then essentially trying to manufacture exit liquidity. Like, there are those are actually kind of really big different concepts.

No, I don't see it unless you posted it in a different room. I don't see anything in here about Burke. I don't know why it would have been deleted though. The bot might not have done it. But yeah, anyways, I would decouple, especially from like the retail trader lens because spoofing is really a game between other firms, other high frequency trading firms typically, not relegated to them, but it's very frequently between other HFTs and market making firms. So I think the connection of pushing retailers into the exit liquidity is not necessarily applicable. Why they do it in general. I think you're answering your own question in terms of getting some sort of liquidity. Check this option chain 5 to Burke B 560 calls very weird at 940. What are we going to check though? There's nothing I'll be able to see here that will be able to confirm or deny whether or not there is spoofing. Maybe I can check it in here. Burke B 560 calls 5 to. Let's see.

I'm trying to think like the way that you're thinking that you detected spoofing. Because from a retail trader lens, there's only a couple things that we could potentially do. I'm wondering how you're thinking about it. Nada? Okay. Well, anyways, I'll continue on. We can talk about it in two different lenses. The first lens is the concept of spoofing. But then the second being some sort of behavior in Burke B, I think the behavior in Burke B doesn't... Let's look at Burke B broadly first before I say that. Okay. I mean, net premiums really weren't that much. Calls ran fairly negative, but not like tremendously. Put side was pretty mellow. The three days that you're talking about seem to have had some activity. I think with the five forties, one or one of those was sold for a spread. No, because it's only 13k against 1800.

Who we talking about? When you say pushing his followers, who's his? I'm not sure. Because that is completely different. That starts to sound more like pump and dump. But to do any sort of pump and dump and something like Burke Shire is fucking crazy. Because the kind of scale that you would need. I would also then completely decouple that from spoofing. It seems like you might be confusing what that is compared to the other thing you're talking about here. Spoofing is layering orders in an order book to provide false appearance and manipulate the appearance of supply and demand functionality in the markets. Which is why like using anything like this, we can't see it. Because the way that you would monitor spoofing is two different ways. If you go to enter an order and then it moves before you get a fill and then you enter an order and then it moves. Those are orders that are completely designed to be pulled before they're filled, which is annoying. But you'll run into that even as an options trader, retail options trader. It's",

I've never heard of this person. It's 77,000 followers. There's no way that they're doing this. Yeah. I think you're confusing a bunch of things. So the first thing is that person is way too small to even attempt a pump and dump on something like Berkshire Hathaway. Berkshire Hathaway is huge. In order to run a successful pump and dump, you really have to be able to control way, way, way more of the volume. Because that's essentially how you create your own wave to get out. When you're trading really, really big names like that, it's next to impossible because there's so many other entities trading at such larger sizes than any one individual that I mean, take a look at this, right?

But the counter party for essentially all of their trades is going to be a market maker. It's not going to be directly paired, you know, retail trader, the group whoever they are, the group is needing to exit their calls. So then they need somebody to buy them from them as they sell them. That's clearly not what's going on here. The other cases they are obviously buying. So while they're going through that buying activity, you need somebody to sell them to you. The probability of retail traders sitting there arresting orders to sell these calls to this other group is probably very little. So the broader thing is I think you're confusing a few different things. I think you're confusing spoofing. I think you're confusing pump and dumps how they work. I think you're detecting a broader thing that seems off to you, which is completely fair. I don't, again, I don't know anything about them. I just think you're confusing the mechanisms by which it would be executed in. Now, for pump and dumps, though, like I said, you'll typically see them done in much smaller names. And it's simply because of the realities of trying to run that kind of scheme. But for the options market, the other side of these trades is a market maker. And",

Because if they're buying these 560 calls using 4 grand, one, it's a tiny position. And two, let's take a look at the 560s in Berkeley. Yeah, they're trading for 23 cents. So the average fill, let's see, where's price? I think it's this one that they use. But it asks volume. Oh, I don't really care. So it looks like what they grabbed him for 22 cents. They're trading for the same right now. Right, like it's that there's, I don't see it. I don't see anything there that leads me to believe that these are being used to try to manipulate some sort of price movement. If it is, it's not working well at all. Because the total again, the size of this was a 170 lot. Look at the minute chart. You mean minute on the option or on the on the stock itself. You will see it's so clear on the option contract at 940. There's nothing to see. Again, I think that you're still confusing. Like just because there's a spike in volume doesn't mean anything.

So I think like I can see what you're talking about that there's a massive spike in volume here. But this happens in all kinds of names. A great example of that is if I go into one of my scans here. This one. And let's just take a look at. Because course, because course literally had an option with 200,000 expansion in volume over OI. So let's take a look at course. And which contract was it the seven puts 19 D's seven puts 19 D's this year. Right. So there's no activity essentially all day. And then at one point in time, there now is a 10,000 lot that clears for 1.38 million. The overall volume on the day was 10,000 to. So what I'm showing you is you're again, you might be suspecting some sort of nefarious behavior. And that I can't comment on I don't know. But from what you're seeing here, it literally doesn't show you anything related to that. Because this is how options trade.

Yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying is that there's really nothing to see there. There's just an expansion in volume. Again, it's literally the same exact thing that I'm showing you here, right? It's this is even a much larger magnitude version of what you just showed me. And again, I can show you hundreds of these because again, this is how options trade. Anytime you look for volume over OI, that is where the volume on that day for some reason explodes in a specific contract doesn't have to explode. It could be a little bit, but typically the scenarios we're talking about is more severe than that. And it's for a trade being built for one reason or another. Again, like there's a prime time example where this trade here shows you. And then you go to course ended up having 10,000 contract volume on this one specific timeframe 1241 to 1242.

What the spike in volume means where it comes from all that kind of stuff. It's a completely different to completely different thing. But if you take a look at the candle volume on this one, it's literally 2400 contracts. It's tiny actually compared to what you see here. This is 2400 contracts spike. Again, this is 10,000 spike. So all you're seeing is a spike in volume. You can't really pull more from it from that without more information. And just to remind everybody, the concept of spoofing is very different as well. Spoofing is done at the institutional level. And it's like mixed with like order stuffing and things like this to manipulate the appearance of supply and demand functions in the market. So, Mattay, you're probably just picking up on like sauce behavior general based on the person that you're talking about. And it could be valid invalid, but you just can't prove anything from that thing there specifically. There's really not much to see. That being said, you should always follow your gut, right?

I don't know anything about them, but that's generally what I'm seeing there is just a whole bunch of not much. All right, gang. That Mattayos says seems like a pump and dumb. Yeah, I don't see that. I don't think you could call it even a pump and dumb because again, the position that was built is still held right now. You're not going to be able to run a pump and dump in that because it's an option. And again, the counter party to his trade is going to be a market maker. Like that's such an important concept to understand. And the other thing is the value of those contracts is not going to be determined by their buying and selling behavior. One, because it's tiny, their buying and selling behavior is secondary largely to the movement of the underlying. So the concept again of a pump and dump is to be able to control the underlying because that's how then you buy shares cheaper. And your buying volume is great enough that it starts showing the appearance of broader interest in this underlying, whatever that is. And then you start selling into the follow on entry volume.

And then you start selling for a small float stock in a big name like Berkshire halfway. They're buying literally doesn't matter because the underlying is still going to be the dominant force. Now sometimes the tail can wag the dog, meaning if there's enough options activity like I was talking about earlier in the stream, it can necessitate certain dealer behavior in terms of hedging activities. And then it requires such an insane scale, especially in something like Berkshire halfway again, like the total premium that we looked at in this options chain. In this specific one that we're talking about in Berk B, the total premium is 413,000. The total premium that that traded today in Berkshire halfway, the total premium is over 30 million. And that 30 million itself still won't move the underlying itself, which if we take a look at what the volume weighted average was here, it's 4.2 million shares. So 4238653 times the current price of 53094. So the total amount of money that traded today in Berkshire halfway is 2.25 billion. So the entire options activity today is completely inconsequential.

What you saw was the contract moving largely due to supply and demand changes, but then also liquidity changes. So the value of that contract, the only reason why it would move between 10 and 41 would be as if there's really false orders resting there that aren't trading, right. So you can see that it didn't actually trade at 10 cents. It was rested at 10 cents, but that's not where people were actually trading at. Then you can see when that volume spikes here, the volume spikes, I wish there was a way to make this one chart a little bigger. I feel like there's got to be a way to do that. That's okay. So you can see the volume, right. The average fill is this yellow line. The average fill that happened today was here in the mid 20s. The cheapest fill that it got on the day was it looks like a one lot. I can't even hover on it 12 cents on an eight lot.

Because what's happening is the market maker doesn't want to be stuck on one side of the order flow. So they continue to adjust their books. They move the bid in the ask and they change what kind of depth they order sizing. So they make it more expensive to continue buying. That's not the price going up. That's not the value of the contracts going up. Again, you can see what the overall value of the contracts ultimately terminated around, which is where it essentially started the day at the 20 handle 20 cents 23 cents something like that. So this is the market makers just causing increasing how much money they're forcing the follow on trades to be executed at. But all of these again, this is there's no. There's no big effect because in terms of the impact of the underlying, but then also the impact to the individual traders because the counter party to these is going to be a market maker.

Other retail traders started buying the position for whatever reason. They're not providing the exit liquidity for them. The market makers would be providing the exit liquidity for them. So yeah.
