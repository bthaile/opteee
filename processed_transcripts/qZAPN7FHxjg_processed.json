    "text": "Do you have a defined process for creating an option strategy? Do you even know where to start? The goal is videos to walk you through end to end and then to give you an example on what this can look like in a simple scenario. But the punchline is if you're going to trade for hopefully a long time, you have got to define a process for this. While strategies are different and they vary based on circumstances, the process to create one is not that different. And we can define a well thought out process that we can multiply and apply in a bunch of different scenarios so that this isn't a painful thing that we're forgetting pieces because we're just kind of cobbling it together as we go. What's up everybody? Eric here. Welcome back to the outliers. Shout out to the Patreon. Let's get right in. So don't be this guy. That's kind of the starting point. So you can see we have a person here that they put on a trade and they're asking a Reddit community, should I hold on to expiration? What's the problem here? The trades on like we are a daily dollar short. You should already know what you're doing before you put the trade on. Don't be this guy. This guy says I sold a put 511 expires today. It's trading below but now it's above why didn't I get assigned? So clearly they don't even understand the risk that",

So clearly they don't even understand the risk that they're taking with the strategy that they put on because again, they didn't build a strategy. They just put a trade on and they're hoping that it works out. Okay, I think that point's been made. So how does this work? As you can tell, we have kind of 11 broad steps here. We're going to run through all of them pretty quickly. Here's the thing. One of the most common mistakes I see new traders make when it comes to building a strategy is they pick a structure and then they just start trying to cobble together a strategy around the structure. The difference between a structure and option structure is a short call, long put. Those are structures. It's an iron condor. It's just a configuration of options. A strategy is how you use that configuration. What rules are applied. So the idea of saying I sell puts is superfluous because sometimes it might make sense to sell puts and other times it might not. There's no reason to be a put seller. There's a good reason to be a trader and trade what makes sense. So as we go through this process, you'll see the very first",

There's a good reason to be a trader and trade what makes sense. So as we go through this process, you'll see the very first step here is pretty clear to find a purpose. What are we trying to do? Notice how this isn't pick a structure. We need to figure out what it is we're trying to accomplish. So what is the goal of this strategy? Are we trying to trade a bullish thesis directionally up? Are we trying to trade a bearish thesis when something's going down? Are we trying to trade volatility? Are we trying to develop something that allows us to have short beta weighted spy deltas? You got to start with what we're even looking for here. And once you do that, we should outline what the money making mechanism is. This is a core competency in trading that shockingly a lot of people have a giant gap. I have a video that talks about this a bit more. I'll throw in the notes below. But here's what this comes down to. A vertical doesn't make money. A long stock share doesn't make money. Long options don't make money. They need a condition to occur to make money.

So the idea here is we're trying to identify the conditions that lead to making money. So is that you're going to trade things directionally to the upside. OK, that's a condition. We know if we buy low and sell high, we make money. We know that there's risk premium in SPX options, for example. That is a money making mechanism. You have to define what this thing is and then how it makes money. So from here, we move on to then determining what structures make sense. So based on if we're trying to trade a bullish thesis where if something is going up, we want to trade it to the upside directionally, what structures make sense for that? List them out. And I would start from simplest and move to more complex. So for example, if we want to trade something that we think is going to go up, you can buy shares. That's the simplest. Then maybe you can buy a call and sell a put so on and so forth. You can list out these different structures that work in this scenario. This is going to help us later.

So based on this idea of we want to trade something directionally to the upside, what are the rules that we want to apply on entering the trade, exiting the trade, and then how long are we looking to hold these trades? Again, if you trade options, guess what? You don't have the luxury of just picking a direction. All options have an expiration. So not only do you need to pick a direction, you also need to understand the severity, how much it's going to move or have an idea on that. And then you also need to have a time bound component. This is actually why options aren't always the right answer. It adds a lot of complexity that may not need to be there. But in any case, these are kind of just three basic rules that you can start with to develop a strategy. So based on this rule set, I would then test those rules with a few things in mind. The first one is I would start with a very big sample. I would use the largest sample I could find. So for example, if I'm trying to trade something in the SPX, that goes all the way back to the 20s.

No. But that doesn't mean that I'm not going to acknowledge it because it's so far gone. Old data still is relevance. So when I look at how do I then make this make more sense, I segment the data. So let's say I'm back testing 10 year period. I'll run a 10 year back test. Then I'll run two five year back tests. Then I'll do five to your back tests. Then I'll do 10 one year back tests. Why do I do that? Because this helps me see the path of the strategy. So for example, you can have something like this in T triple cues where let's say you were just buying T triple cues. And if you just test this broad data like, wow, you went from 36 cents to 59. That's a great return. That's perfect.

So an example of this is let's say that you want to trade directionally and you actually want to use leverage. Well, that right out of the gate will probably get us away from using long shares.

And specifically for the Patreon members, the outlier pro folks, you have free access to the shop that I have. So you can download templates for both of those from there. And if you aren't in the Patreon, that's okay. You can check out this video on the notes below that walks through an outline on how to create a strategy so that you can make your own without that. But the point being is unequivocally, you need to define what you're doing and then you need to track how that goes. This is how we objectively see what works by repeatedly testing and changing specific variables so that we understand their effect and then we can optimize them. Now you have to be careful between overfitting, but in general, if you're using a large sample then a segmented sample and then you're even getting into this next step where we're going to back test and forward test again, you're going to limit that inherently. So we want things that are robust. We want things that hold true in large samples and then also generally hold true in the smaller samples as much as possible or at least have observable patterns that we can then calculate different approaches off of. So once we get through this cursory back test,",

So once we get through this cursory back test, I think of it like working down a funnel. I want to start with the biggest funnel and then get more and more specific because you get more specific. It takes more time to analyze these things. So this next stage of back testing, forward testing, it's not super time consuming, but it gives us a chance to take a look at the rules set. Now you might be thinking, how do we even back test this stuff? There's different ways you can do that. You can either jump in a platform. I'm an affiliate of two of them, O rats and options, Omega. They're both in the links below for discount codes, but that's if you don't want to get your own data, but you are completely capable of getting your own data from Cebo and you can either run back tests and something like Python. It's up to you how you want to back test. If you don't want to do any of that, you could consider doing something like on demand and think or swim, which is free.

Like think about if you're a professional athlete, you need stuff to do your job and as a professional athlete, you're not necessarily paying for that stuff, but somebody does. It's not free. It doesn't just fall out of the sky. Somebody still has to buy the stuff that they use. It's the same thing here, but in this case, as a sole proprietor, you're by yourself. You have to buy it. You have to procure it. So I wouldn't come into this thinking that you're going to be able to just get fantastic data easily for free. It's just not reasonable. So then you can also pay for trade with different variations. I do this anyways, but this is also free, but it takes time. You only get to pay for trade with the market show you. And for example, I started trading in 2007 from 2007 until now, 2024. There's only been three bear markets and two of those have been in the last four years. What that means is if you just pay for trade at this, you're really getting a skewed view of the path something takes. So I really believe in paper trading. I",

What that means is if you just pay for trade at this, you're really getting a skewed view of the path something takes. So I really believe in paper trading. I do it with live strategies, kind of actually in this sustained optimization stage as well, but this stage here step nine is when we're actually trading it exactly as we think we would. And at the same time, we have different variations that we're also paper trading. So I kind of segment this into two buckets. I have the paper trading I'm doing to simulate my actual account and then I have the paper trading I'm doing to collect data. So the way I do that is the stuff I'm using to collect data. I'll put on tons of different trades, thousands of them and track them, right? I'm creating a data set. I'm not worried about actually doing that exactly as I would, but in the paper trading account that I'm testing as if it were live, I'm going to size things exactly as I would. I'm going to manage them exactly as I would because it gives me the best view of how this actually would work. And we have our live test is when you start using real money, none of this testing is ever going to be the same as using live capital. That's all there",

But the idea is we want to make as many mistakes as we can and get as much headway as we can before we're throwing capital at things. I know for the impatient people, I wasn't the beginning. This seems really painful in a waste of time, but the fact of the matter is, is you are far more likely to lose money than make it as a trader. So by not losing money unnecessarily and setting your account back further than it needs to go, you're actually moving faster in terms of compounding your capital. So going slow upfront actually will get you a speedier result in the long run. So what does this actually look like? I kind of outlined what this in large steps goes down like and here's kind of a quick flow. So in number one here, I'm saying I need long beta weighted spy delta. So that means I need something that goes up when the S and P 500 goes up. This can be whatever you want. This could be you need negative beta weighted spy delta so that you have some uncorrelated or non correlated returns. You could also",

In this stage here, what I recommend to traders is have a specific use case in mind. Don't just think about building strategies for the sake of it. Think about what the market does. The market goes up. I need a strategy for that. Things go down. I need a strategy for that. If I trade volatility, I need a strategy to trade volatility when it goes up down sideways. So as I look across the toolkit, you can start to see that you don't need 35 different strategies. You kind of just need a handful because you need to be able to trade directionally up down. You need to be able to trade volatility up down. Maybe there's a couple of risk premium strategies in their momentum, premium strategies in their news announcement strategies in there, stuff like that. But they're not all unique.

So really think about how many strategies you need and what for we shouldn't just have a laundry list of stuff. Then I go through the rest of these stages to codify what I'm doing. Now getting down to kind of testing things. This is from using Python. And the cool part about this is it lets you test simple thesis. And if you wanted to test something like options, it starts to get a little more complex. You have to calculate them yourselves or buy historic data. So maybe if that's too prohibitive for you, you actually just see maybe a directional assumption. And then you can use logic to reason through the rest. For example, let's say that you don't have data to back test and you want it to understand which one would make you more money. Let's say that's one of the questions you have. Would it be long stock or long options? Well, if you put the same amount of money in both and you get the move in your favor, you're going to make money with long options.

    "text": "long stock or long options? Well, if you put the same amount of money in both and you get the move in your favor, you're going to make money with long options. So you can also reason through some of this if you don't have access to the data. When I start pairing down these different choices, I think about the structures because is a long call the same thing as a short put? No, long calls have defined risk. They have undefined profit potential. So if the thesis that I'm trying to trade is directional momentum, meaning I want it to move a lot, would I prefer a long call or short put? Probably the long call. That's a better fit for that thesis, a directional momentum trade. If you trade a short put in that scenario, it could still make money, but you have a defined risk or a defined profit right out of the gate and undefined risk. So by understanding the qualities of the options, you can then use that to further narrow down what best fits again, what money making mechanism you are trying to capitalize on. Then we go down to these last steps. We're going to test multiple variations. We're going to use something like this, a strategy outline to document what we think we're going to do. And then we iterate on this process. A good example of this iteration and I'll throw a link in the notes below that talks about",

A good example of this iteration and I'll throw a link in the notes below that talks about this exact thing where for zero DTE and even earnings for a long time, I favored straddles made more money. But with the markets over the last four years or so, I've actually started moving to strangles more frequently because I need the delta offset based on how the markets are behaving. So how did I come to that conclusion by this down here, by continually to optimize what I'm doing because if I just use the original analysis that I did and stopped, I probably would actually be losing money on some of those as compared to making money. You have to continue to adapt your strategies to what the markets are doing. That's the name of the game, more traders. That's our job. See what the market is doing. Fit your toolkit to the market to make money. Like, subscribe, share, be an outlier. See you all later.",
