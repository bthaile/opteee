    "text": "What's up, outliers? We're further along with the election and now it's time to start figuring out how to further the gains we have already stacked up from the original surge. And I want to talk about a couple different things, specifically some of the primary policies that Trump has talked about, their potential impacts. And then some different time frames to keep in mind for creating positions because the first 90 days is going to be a specific window for us to look at in a certain way. And then really once you start getting out beyond that six months plus, there will be other things that come into play more thematic style positions, which we'll talk about. So let's get right into things. First things first, this is old news. We already know this. Donald Trump already won the electoral votes required for presidency 295 versus 226 not even close. Okay, great. Next up, we have the Senate. So the Senate is definitely sitting firm in the Republican hands over 50, 50 is majority here. So they have 53. And then last, we have the House. And it looks like the potential for a red sweep is very high. And right now the Republicans are at 211 seats against the Dems 199. And today is the seventh of November. So you can see that we're definitely looking at a specific circumstance here. And the reason why this matters is because if Trump has all three branches here, the",

So you can see that we're definitely looking at a specific circumstance here. And the reason why this matters is because if Trump has all three branches here, the first two years of his presidency are going to move like lightning fast. And it's because he's going to try to maximize how much he can get through with Republican support in both the House and the Senate, less so the case if there's Democrats on one side of the aisle that tends to slow things down in terms of what can get through and when. So that's the landscape as it as we look at it. Let's talk about policies. We'll start with some domestic policies and then we'll talk more about these international policies. I don't know, fly through these, but these are just a handful of them. There's more. And the main thing I want to note here is that we're still missing a ton of information. We've just heard talking points about most of these, but we haven't actually seen an outline planned yet. We will soon. And that will add a lot of clarity around this. So from a domestic standpoint, we're seeing things like deregulation coming into the conversation, decreased spending from a governmental perspective, trying to decrease the overall deficit that we're in.

Trump has talked about actually I find a pretty interesting corporate tax change. So going from 21 to 20, but the cool part here is he's talking about 15 tax for domestic producers. So you can see that they're really trying to incentivize domestic production of goods. Now, I don't know the details here. I don't know how much domestic production equals domestic production for the tax cut. I doubt it will be full 100. We'll have to see, but those kinds of details will matter to a degree. We know that renewable energy is definitely less of a focus for him, same thing with climate change. And that means that he's way more open to fossil fuel use and tapping into the oil. He's very vocal about that deportation and immigration is another big issue that he discussed. And there's very likely going to be large deportation. The reason why this matters is because a lot of companies use a legal labor and it's cheaper for everybody. So that's going to impact all different kinds of companies and all different kinds of industries that leverage illegal immigrants for cheaper labor. Now, big pharma is going to come over massive scrutiny. And this is because Trump has talked about granting",

Now, big pharma is going to come over massive scrutiny. And this is because Trump has talked about granting RFK his dream of being able to take a really hard look at the total health of America. And big pharma is a big part of RFK's focus. So with RFK heading up the public health agencies, I think that we're going to see really clear impacts from that, which we'll talk a little bit about on a heat map. So if you take a look here, this is just on the day. And there's definitely still some lingering issues for pharmaceuticals. So if we grab Johnson and Johnson on this little tiny chart above my head, you'll see that they're falling off a cliff. They're unhappy. So pharmaceuticals, I believe are going to come under fire a little bit. Healthcare provider services, they are a little bit more resilient. Same thing with biotech and life sciences. They were not quite as impacted. But pharmaceuticals was really the main thing I highlighted after the election win. So this is something to keep in mind, defense spending and space force defense spending is kind of domestic and international in its nature.

But the way that this pans out is going to be also really heavily influenced by the international policy in Ukraine, Russia, and then with Israel and Hamas. Depending on how those conflicts go, which we're spending tens of billions of dollars supporting right now, that will likely impact defense spending. But I don't see overall defense spending domestically actually slowing down. I think that Trump is advocating for peace through strength. So that means that he's also likely going to invest heavily into something like the space force, which is still in its infancy. One of my buddies actually just did an interest service transfer from the Marine Corps over to the space force, which is kind of cool. It's wild that it's called the space force. It sounds like something out of like a comedy movie, but it is that. We also have some conversation around tech regulation, which I find really interesting. And you can see this is an article from Wired. And I'll just highlight this one section here. It says Trump has shown to stay in for big tech companies. And he's been vocal about pursuing policies that increase the cost of doing business for them and subject them to more unfavorable regulations. And it seems like this is something that he's talked about even",

Then we also have the injection of crypto regulation, kind of the furthering of bringing cryptocurrency into the folder is even a movement now around the central bank digital currency and what that could look like. So crypto markets have reacted very favorably to the Trump election. So if we take a look really quick and we run over instead of Johnson and Johnson, which I just showed you was falling off a cliff. But if we actually take a look at cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is hitting all time highs here. So very much in favor of the recent change. And now from an international perspective, we already touched on these two conflicts, but then there's also the China tariff. The way that this rolls out is going to be really important because this is actually quite inflationary. And that's one of the big things that Trump is going to have to contest with as he goes through this is that a lot of the stuff that he wants to do is wrapped around growth, which is going to be inflationary by its nature.",

But we're still in pretty high inflationary environment. The Fed just cut rates and their future rate cutting roadmap actually slowed down a lot after Trump won the election. So it looks like the way that this might roll out would probably be phased over time because if this is like an overnight short term thing, that would cause absolutely catastrophic shock to the system. And pretty much lots of different entities from consumer staples and more specifically consumer discretionary are going to get crushed. So think of things like Walmart's targets, those kinds of places that essentially exist off of Chinese goods. That's going to be really difficult. And then we also have the US, Mexico, Canada agreement. So they're he's talking about renegotiating specifically the the automobile section of that agreement to be slightly more favorable to the US. All right, so that's a bunch of things. This is not holistic, but these are some of the primary things that I'm looking at. So now if we take a look quickly at something else, I want to show you how various sectors are doing right now. So this is using a five one month and three month chart.",

So let me show you, for example, if we take a look at what's not in favor, utilities, if you go out three months, utilities was up over 6 a month ago is down to and now it's down 2.83. So definitely slowing down here. Then if you take a look at some of the other things that are likely to struggle a little bit, staples, because if inflation remains high, the cost of getting the things you need is going to be expensive. So no shock here real estate similar thing with rates and the 30 year moving up as far as it did. It's up almost to 7 now again in anticipation of the rate environment remaining about the same. And stuff like financials is about is happy as it could be. And same thing with information technology, this is a little bit of a mixed bag in my opinion, because if we take a look at the tech sector, so if we go in here and take a look at the heat map and specifically look at information technology, you can see that across the board, they're actually",

So this to me indicates that some of the conversation points around Trump discussing regulation of these larger entities seems to be a little bit more siloed. Now something like that Chinese tariff would be a massive influence for something like Apple, but Apple so far is still generally happy. So I'm not so sure how serious to take the risk here because Apple isn't taking it that seriously, but something to keep an eye on. Now the last thing I want to talk about are just ways to think about trading these different time frames. And if we break out these different elements into 90 day time frames, which I would consider to be more appropriate for momentum style trading, and then six months plus further than that even is more thematic. So this is where we're trying to front run some of the policy statements. So if we just essentially use the yellow boxes for momentum and then anything that's not would fall onto the thematic category, we can see things like deregulation is already having a massive impact. So if we go to something like XLF, you can see it literally jumped. It",

So if we go to something like XLF, you can see it literally jumped. It gapped up from 46 and change and it opened up at 49 on the sixth. So deregulation is absolutely going to massively impact the financial sector. And it's going to drive their profitability writ large. Now the decreased renewal emphasis, we can see that being represented in stuff like oil and gas starting to gain a little bit of strength here. So if we go into this tab here and then we go into energy, this is a little bit of a down tick on the day today. But if we take a look at some of the producers like KMI, they're doing really well. Exxon mobile is interesting because a lot of oil producers have been struggling relatively recently. But based on the recent outcome from the election, they seem to be doing a little bit better here, right? So again, it's not doing well. It's still in this downtrend. But if we take a look at the response on the six, it was a gap up from here.

Then we have big farmer where we talked about that. The defense spending and space force, this one's a little early to tell, but this is where we can look at stuff like Lockheed Martin. And you can see that on the six, they got a bit of a bounce, but still they really fell off a cliff. You're post earnings. So that's a little bit of an influence going on there. If we take a look at Raytheon, similar story bounce up on the six following the notification. So what I'm highlighting is that defense in general prefers this outcome, but they still look a little bit weak here on a shorter term time frame. Crypto regulation, I already talked about Bitcoin. So a lot of these things are going to be shorter term in nature. And the way that I talk, especially for those in the Patreon, we spend some time looking through these different sectors to find what sectors are performing well and expanding and then looking for leaders within those sectors.

Long equities right now is such a tough trade to beat because if we look at something as simple as just forward e-minis, I mean, they're at nosebleeds. They crack above six and they're hanging out up there. So I look at this as two different trading windows. There's the near term follow through of all this stuff about 90 days. And then beyond that, we start getting into more thematic positioning based on when we get a little more clarity around the policies. So hope that was helpful. If there's any questions, throw them in the comments below. And then if there's anything you're specifically looking at, I would love to hear about that as well. Be an outlier.
