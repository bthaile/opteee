    "text": "information technology this is a little bit of a mixed bag in my opinion because if we take a look at the tech sector so if we go in here and take a look at the heat map and specifically look at Information Technology you can see that across the board they're actually responding really really favorably so this to me indicates that some of the the conversation points around Trump discussing regulation of these larger entities seems to be a little bit more siloed now something like that Chinese tariff would be a massive influence for something like apple but Apple so far is still generally happy so I'm not so sure how serious to take the risk here because Apple isn't taking it that seriously but something to keep an eye on now the last thing I want to talk about are just ways to think about trading these different time frames and if we break out these different elements into 90day time frames which I would consider to be more appropriate for momentum Style Trading and then 6 months plus further than that even is more thematic so this is where we're trying to front run some of the policy statements so if we just essentially use the Yellow Boxes for momentum and then anything that's not would fall into the Thematic category we can see things like deregulation is already having a massive impact so if we go to something like XLF you can see it",
