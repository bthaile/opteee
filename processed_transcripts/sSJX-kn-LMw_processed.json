The goal of this video is to do two things. It's to show you some very important zero DTE trends from their daily launch of options in SPX specifically back in 2022, round May. And the second thing I want to show you is comparing zero DTE options against one DTE option. And you might as well, doesn't that defeat the purpose of zero DTE options where you're in and out in a day. And that's definitely the case. But there is an overnight volatility effect. And then at the end of the video, I'm actually going to show you an even more interesting strategy. So we'll see when we get there. So first, let's start with a quick recap of just the option space. Now I've shown you different variations of this. She previously I'll throw a couple links to other videos that really outline this way more in detail because I want to use it as a launch point for what we're going to talk about today. There's just not enough time in the video. And what I specifically want to walk you through is a quick reminder of what you're looking at. This again is showing us effectively from May 16th of 22 into March of 2025. That's the recent snapshot that I grabbed. And I specifically want to",

So these represent the delta for the short legs and then the long legs if there are long legs and then the entry time, the lot size, the days to expiration. We're not applying any profit or loss management to this. We're just letting them go into expiration and then we'll review the performance. Now one thing to note why 1500 Pacific time. Well, I'm sorry, 1500 Eastern time, which represents 1200 Pacific time. It's because this time frame in again, from the other videos held up better and more robust. It wasn't optimized 1400 actually works a little bit better, but the variance of year over year, month over month is less with this. So this is why and why 1015 20 30 50. These are popular single option. Why not five delta because we know those don't perform well from the prior videos. Why on these are we doing five delta's for all of them? This essentially to create a synthetic short option spread by capping the risk though. So we're really trying to keep these as wide as possible.

So we're really trying to keep these as wide as possible. Five delta effectively balances liquidity needs with the actual purpose of the trade. And then for the iron fly, we're using 50 delta and then 15 delta wings. And the reason for this is to actually have it offset enough of the risk. If you go super wide, then you're effectively just mirroring this. Now you'll notice that this is the entire time frame. Then this is segmented by 23 and then 24 and then down here, you'll notice we switch to a one DTE. So the context of the one DTE is essentially we would enter this towards the end of let's say Monday. And then we would leave this on overnight into Tuesday and then it would expire on Tuesday after the close. So let's first take a quick look at the total performance for the entire time frame. And you'll notice a couple things. This is all standard fare for what you've seen previously, which is the naked strategies drastically outperform the strategies that include wings. And again, this is pretty logical because these positions benefit from having capped risk. So they're not truly going to underperform. Now the benefit here is you can see their compound annual growth rate does lag pretty significantly. However, their max drawdown",

However, their max drawdown also outperforms significantly. So it's always a function of choose your own adventure. So I have used all different versions, both in paper trading and then also in live trading. The data set that you see here is a hybrid of data that I've purchased from SIBO. And that's what I used to query against. So next up, let's take a look at 22 and 20, I'm sorry, 23 and 24. And you'll notice a couple of things between these two different years. 23 showed positive performance across the board again with the benefit going to naked options. And then 24 actually starts lagging. And we're seeing negative numbers emerge. And this is representation for the entire year. So what's going on here? Well, if we take a look really quick at what volatility did in 23 and 24, you can see in 2023, volatility was in a broad downtrend. And then in 2024, you can actually see volatility started expanding quite a lot actually into the first half of the year with this trend. Then it spiked down and then it shot back up. So this movement that you see in 24 is really challenging for the strategy to",

There are periods where this works better than other periods. And this is one of the key trends that identify for you where if we're going through a regime where volatility is generally declining, these strategies perform well. And then if we're going through a period where that volatility is starting to expand the strategies struggle. And this is a really important function of using VIX and different VIX indicators to help us identify this trend. And I'll give you a few examples of those right now. So if we use something like the VIX one day, which is relatively new, you can see that obviously it's going to be just all over the map. But you can monitor the trend of the VIX one day compared to something like other term VIX provisions, which obviously standard VIX gives us one month. And then you can do something like VIX three month. And you can monitor the trend of VIX three month by keeping an eyeball",

You can start to detect when volatility is going through a transitory phase like we saw again through 2024 or it was steadily climbing, which is where these strategies start to hurt. And it's exactly why you saw a 2024 underperform. So now let's take a look at how these compare against one DTE and one DTE did. Very poorly across the board except for one region. And that was in 2024 in 2024 overnight volatility actually outperformed one day, vol for the naked strategies. And it's also worth noting that the spread strategies still underperform across the board. But this is the one period where it actually stuck out to me is pretty interesting. So what that means is overnight vol starts to look a little bit more attractive when the market is going through these expansion phases of steady growth. The other thing to take away from this is overnight vol in general is not priced well, especially from 2023. And then when you look across the entire sample, meaning not priced well to be advantage to sellers, this is fascinating to me because there is another period of time that is wildly profitable",
