    "text": "What's up everybody Eric here and I'm back with my friend Tom Bassow. Although your name says Thomas, which is very formal, but it's good to have you back again. Welcome to the outlier podcast. It's great to have you on again. Thank you to be here. So this year, last year, it's been super busy and from a kind of macro level standpoint, it seems like the market is in this transition period, whether or not we hold here, move higher, hold here, start to collapse down. What are your thoughts on where we stand in the markets literally right now? Well, you're speaking of the stock market, no doubt. But you have to remember, I trade 26 futures markets. I trade anything. The metals, currencies, ag products, meats, and so on. So a lot of markets are going through transitions. I would say that earlier in the year, I saw a lot of commodity markets tending to do all right. They were starting to get the inflation thing going. There were some disruptions. There was some drought in the ag area. In the case of the stock market itself, you certainly had a really lousy last year and then you transition to this sort of, we're going to have a recession and we're going to, at the same time, the Fed is going to absolutely clamp down on inflation. So people didn't trust the rally. I think we could take a little side trip for the traders that",

So people didn't trust the rally. I think we could take a little side trip for the traders that were watching this down the road and say that this is a great example of why you shouldn't predict. You shouldn't try to guess what's going to happen because the vast majority of traders, I think, guessed that we were going to have either a recession and therefore the stock market will be weak or we're going to have the Fed just killing all the joy of higher interest rates. So they stood aside and just were absolutely convinced that this thing is not going to rally. I took the hedges off. I don't even remember now. January, February or something, a long, long time ago. And I've been unhedged and just almost fully invested the whole way doing very well in a great year so far. I didn't predict it. I mean, I would have said that I would have agreed with everybody's predictions, but from a trader's viewpoint, I don't worry about what I think the market's going to do. I look at the prices, it cuts through the indicator, hits my stops. I'm long, move the stops up when you can control your position sizes and risk and wash, wash rinse and repeat over and over again",

And so it becomes a bit as easy as breathing at this point, but I think that that's what I've seen now. And now we're getting to the point where I'm starting to see some cracks in the foundation. I'm seeing out of my nine strategies, one of them dedicates itself to being long or short NQ, which would be NASDAQ futures, either long or short. And it's the indicators I use there are nine day indicators. And so it's a little shorter term than a lot. My long term sector timing or my longer term futures trading is so I kind of call it sort of the intermediate term because I have one other program that I'm down in two to three year or two to three day time frame. But this nine day indicator is already going over to the to the downside. I'm short NQ futures. I've sold off. I was fully invested 30 out of 30 for at least a few days in the sector timing. So that's 30 different sectors, all stocks with one set right. Yeah, one bond fund is in there. So 29 stocks and one bond. And",

And we're getting pretty close now that if you look at my head chart on enjoy the right dot world, my website on the hedge page, you'll see the stops on my new hedge going on, keep coming up higher and higher and the market keeps going lower and lower. And they look like they're going to come close to each other here in another few days or a week hard to say. So I'm keeping my eye on it because if that goes over, I'm now fully hedged. And I'll take off that amount of risk. So in that point, who knows, you know, things starts rolling downward and people get panicked and all these people who have now predicted that we're not going to have a recession and we're definitely going to have the South landing.

And it's slowly starting to change for a while. It was no change and it's slowly starting to ratchet up for another increase. But you mentioned one thing on the bond funds, which are bond index that maybe want to ask you, what do you think about 30 year treasury yields right now? They had that giant pop. And I thought that was really interesting movement. Obviously, there's a little bit of impact coming on from the Fed and, you know, removing liquidity. But I'm curious, like, what do you make of that movement? Because essentially, you know, looking at the beginning of July, it was, you know, 3843 and now it's up at like 43. So it's a pretty meaningful move. Yeah, I would say bonds in general, though, have had, if you think about close to 40 years of the wind that they're back, going back to Reaganomics in 1980. And just recently in the last few years, with the inflation and the fighting inflation and the Fed increasing the rates and all that, bonds have had the wind in their face.

And so the question is, where are we on the whole scheme of things? I don't see inflation going away anytime soon. Every a lot of people predicted sticky. My, I guess, elementary level economics brain tells me that we're probably going to be fighting inflation for some time. I don't think it'll ever get to, unless we get into like a depression or something, maybe it just collapses and we're all in that, then you're, you're going to want your 40 acres in the woods. But other than that type of scenario, I don't see in any normal times, interest rates going down a huge amount. I can see them going up more to fight inflation that we've continued to have and continues to seem sticky. So I think bonds are, I wouldn't want to have a lot of, a lot of money at them right now. I think the return to risk could be lousy. Right. And you bring up another point that's actually the note that I was jotting down. I'd love to get your perspective.

Like I already just complains about the Fed, but like they're not dumb. They're doing the best they can with a lot of information. They're obviously arguably little late to the party. But when we're looking at the way that this continues forward, Powell has been very steady on the drumbeat of we're going to continue tightening until the job is done. How do you view that kind of phrasing against some of the early cracks we started to see in the banking sector? And then at what point would you imagine the Fed would say, I understand this is my silver bullet, but I'm breaking everything with it. When, when does that happen? And then what happens at that juncture? Yeah, I would also be a Fed basher. I think they waited too long to do anything. And I think that's partially political problem. They seem to be political animals more and more. They used to be independent back when I was a lot younger. Nowadays it seems as though they're just trying to always act in political fashions.

And they're probably going to be too late or overdo it to the other side too. And they're going to be panicking when they start seeing some big banks go into trouble. And they're going to have to scramble and say, I don't know. I guess we ought to ease back a little bit. We've overdone it. And they'll probably be too late doing that too. They seem to be looking in the rear of the mirror as they drive. So I don't know. I think that I agree that he has been a Powell that has been very consistent with the message. And that's good because half of his job is convincing others that they're serious about whatever it is that they're trying to talk about. If he doesn't stay consistent with his message, he'll get ripped apart and probably replaced by somebody who can stay consistent to his message.

And when they sell stuff like that, they are taking money out of the money supply. And so that's sort of a double whammy. If they keep the industry high and are reducing the money supply, you're going to choke any chance that you would have to get the economy rolling. And growth of the economy in my mind is the only logical, super good way to lift all everybody's incomes across all sorts of sectors of the economy to have a growing economy. And what I see happening in Washington with Congress and the administration, along with what I see happening with the Fed, all speaks to killing the growth in the economy. And that's not going to be a long term recipe for success. Sadly. And I'm kind of really curious about here is last week we had some, was it last week the week before we had some pretty good wage numbers come out. And then today we had CPI, PPI come out and CPI looked okay. It I have the same sensation as you do in terms of the overall assessment that I have, but I am surprised",

For me, very similar to you, I've been like quite utilized most of the year. But when we come into times like this, especially over the last month, I've been pretty selective.

So as those get over a certain level and it's different for every single strategy and different for every all sorts of different markets, but each specific strategy has its own level of allowable risk. I would take an example of in my futures trading, I would have like a half a percent risk to get into the position. And I would allow each position to grow to be 1 of my portfolio risk as long as that was due to profits. And my stop is struggling to keep up with how fast I'm making money.

So as markets like what we've experienced this year have come along, I've just been reducing position sizes. Now that solves part of the problem. The second part of the problem is solved in my mind or at least it's addressed by continuing to have movable trailing stops that are large logical. I'm giving the market enough room and if the market becomes more volatile, I give it plenty of space. I use things like ATR average true range to try to measure the volatility and keep my stops at least a volatility or sometimes two times volatility away from where the market is. And that is usually sufficient to stay out of the noise. But as the market keeps rolling along like it has been, I keep moving those stops up. So I'm moving the stops up, I'm peeling positions off. I'm always getting ready and I've those stops. So in many cases are stopping reverse as soon as those stops are yet. I'm now short.

Yeah, when you think about whenever this unwind comes from the Fed, what trading themes come to mind for you when that inevitably does occur? Well, you're talking the interest rates staying. I wouldn't say bonds would be a great place unless you're just trying to find a place to park cash. I would keep it on short term bonds, not long term. If anything, one year or less maturity in my mind, what themes come to mind? Well, one thing that strikes me that's been decent and could get exciting if it broke out would be the crypto futures could be an interesting game to play because there's no really limit on how much they could move and they've been very volatile and volatile instruments tend to be a trader's best friend because after all we all have to buy and we have to sell.

And the farther and faster something moves, the more profitable it can be if you're on the right side of it. So I'd be watching those markets for starters. I like silver. It seems to move quickly. And if we have a situation where inflation is persistent, perhaps that could have a move right now. It's not. It's on downside. But it could perk up and people who get excited about that, especially if the stock market was selling off and people thought, all right, the world's going to an end. I better buy gold now or something. That might be another play. Energy seems to be the way I'm trading, unleaded gas. I'm trading natural gas futures and I'm trading many crude oil futures. And all three of those look like they have the potential to be headed upward now. And they. I could see where if we have an inflationary environment, you got the price of the commodities products, the energy products could easily go up against the dollar.

I think there's a flexibility to do things a lot quicker and a lot faster and a little more innovative you don't have to answer to you know board of directors and a committee of 10 trying to find on every aspect of this particular decision. So there's a lot of advantage that a small company has versus a larger competitor the large competitor on the other hand has staying power financing expertise perhaps in house that they don't have to go outside of house to get and so they can tend to squash some small competitors. So the way I like to think of small cap stocks is if they're just in a same industry and competing for the same product and it's a generic product of some sort there's nothing special there.

    "text": "in a same industry and competing for the same product and it's a generic product of some sort there's nothing special there. I lean towards the liquidity of the larger company because I think that then you have that ability to survive perhaps tough times on the other side of it. So I have a small company that has done something like a niche you know like back in the days of COVID zoom became a household it's now you know not if we're going to do a telecomphets call it's are we going to zoom. It's almost become like zero oxies became copying something you zero acts it even though zero actually was a brand name you were zero oxing the piece of paper and the South my wife is fond she's from Jackson Mississippi originally and she's fond of telling me that when you in my northern New York terms would say that you'd want a soda pop. No in the South you get a coke right right what kind of a seven up or do you want a doctor pepper or you want a coke a call or a Pepsi but they're all coax right and so I think that's what we face with small cap is finding those interesting stories that are supplying a niche that the big guys haven't figured out yet. Those are the ones that are really the you know the thousand baggers that you can really do very well with and establish",

Those are the ones that are really the you know the thousand baggers that you can really do very well with and establish long term positions so those are the ones I would always try to see God if I was trying to go into small cap land. I know we're coming up on time here but do you trade orange juice features yes what what's going on there I was looking at the movement I don't trade orange juice features myself very much but I can't help but not see that move and follow the move at this point but what do you like yeah what's the deal. I'm not a fundamentalist so I'll be just taking some pot pot guesses at this but there's two things that seems to always affect the long term of orange juice number one it's the weather in Florida during the winter because it seems like perpetually all the trips I've ever made to Orlando I get there in the middle of January or something of frost hits and everybody's got the smudge pots out and they're trying to try and to warm up the air over top of the orange crop the orange trees and then invariably you get these issue these super winter freezes that would knock out whatever 20 to pick a number",

So long term what ends up happening is the the amount of orange crop keeps kind of struggling to be as prolific as it was back in the day so I think those two factors are creating a lot of uncertainty in exactly the supply and demand of orange juice and I think there's been some nice moves so traders that like to just measure a trend and go with it. It's been very, very good this year both up and down. Yeah it's yeah I because it popped up back like early this",

It's been very, very good this year both up and down. Yeah it's yeah I because it popped up back like early this year I want to say like February March where it had like that one just vertical set and then I was like wow that's kind of interesting and then ever since then I watched it March from 200 to over 300 over the course of you know like March to now and it's like man. Man one of one of my posts on Twitter back in probably February or run in there when it was going vertical was orange juice futures remind me of a B 22 taking off after a Chinese spy balloon. You know it takes off it's the after burgers and that's kind of the way the chart looked. Yeah yeah of course we let the spy balloon just drift across the entire country but you know that's a whole other story when we want to take it out it's done.
