Welcome to the outlier podcast. It's great to have you on again. Thank you to be here. So this year, last year, it's been super busy and from a kind of macro level standpoint, it seems like the market is in this transition period, whether or not we hold here, move higher, hold here, start to collapse down. What are your thoughts on where we stand in the markets literally right now? Well, you're speaking of the stock market, no doubt. But you have to remember, I trade 26 futures markets. I trade anything. The metals, currencies, ag products, meats, and so on. So a lot of markets are going through transitions. I would say that earlier in the year, I saw a lot of commodity markets tending to do all right. They were starting to get the inflation thing going. There were some disruptions. There was some drought in the ag area. In the case of the stock market itself, you certainly had a really lousy last year and then you transition to this sort of, we're going to have a recession and we're going to, at the same time, the Fed is going to absolutely clamp down on inflation. So people didn't trust the rally. I think we could take a little side trip for the traders that",

So people didn't trust the rally. I think we could take a little side trip for the traders that were watching this down the road and say that this is a great example of why you shouldn't predict. You shouldn't try to guess what's going to happen because the vast majority of traders, I think, guessed that we were going to have either a recession and therefore the stock market will be weak or we're going to have the Fed just killing all the joy of higher interest rates. So they stood aside and just were absolutely convinced that this thing is not going to rally. I took the hedges off. I don't even remember now. January, February or something, a long, long time ago. And I've been unhedged and just almost fully invested the whole way doing very well in a great year so far. I didn't predict it. I mean, I would have said that I would have agreed with everybody's predictions, but from a trader's viewpoint, I don't worry about what I think the market's going to do. I look at the prices, it cuts through the indicator, hits my stops. I'm long, move the stops up when you can control your position sizes and risk and wash, wash rinse and repeat over and over again",

I'm seeing out of my nine strategies, one of them dedicates itself to being long or short NQ, which would be NASDAQ futures, either long or short. And it's the indicators I use there are nine day indicators. And so it's a little shorter term than a lot. My long term sector timing or my longer term futures trading is so I kind of call it sort of the intermediate term because I have one other program that I'm down in two to three year or two to three day time frame. But this nine day indicator is already going over to the to the downside. I'm short NQ futures. I've sold off. I was fully invested 30 out of 30 for at least a few days in the sector timing. So that's 30 different sectors, all stocks with one set right. Yeah, one bond fund is in there. So 29 stocks and one bond. And",

And just recently in the last few years, with the inflation and the fighting inflation and the Fed increasing the rates and all that, bonds have had the wind in their face. And so the question is, where are we on the whole scheme of things? I don't see inflation going away anytime soon. Every a lot of people predicted sticky. My, I guess, elementary level economics brain tells me that we're probably going to be fighting inflation for some time. I don't think it'll ever get to, unless we get into like a depression or something, maybe it just collapses and we're all in that, then you're, you're going to want your 40 acres in the woods. But other than that type of scenario, I don't see in any normal times, interest rates going down a huge amount. I can see them going up more to fight inflation that we've continued to have and continues to seem sticky. So I think bonds are, I wouldn't want to have a lot of, a lot of money at them right now. I think the return to risk could be lousy. Right. And you bring up another point that's actually the note that I was jotting down. I'd love to get your perspective. The tightening cycle that we went through with the Fed is unprecedented. It's literally one of the first series that we've seen like that. And I am very curious. It's easy",

Like I already just complains about the Fed, but like they're not dumb. They're doing the best they can with a lot of information. They're obviously arguably little late to the party. But when we're looking at the way that this continues forward, Powell has been very steady on the drumbeat of we're going to continue tightening until the job is done. How do you view that kind of phrasing against some of the early cracks we started to see in the banking sector? And then at what point would you imagine the Fed would say, I understand this is my silver bullet, but I'm breaking everything with it. When, when does that happen? And then what happens at that juncture? Yeah, I would also be a Fed basher. I think they waited too long to do anything. And I think that's partially political problem. They seem to be political animals more and more. They used to be independent back when I was a lot younger. Nowadays it seems as though they're just trying to always act in political fashions.

And when they sell stuff like that, they are taking money out of the money supply. And so that's sort of a double whammy. If they keep the industry high and are reducing the money supply, you're going to choke any chance that you would have to get the economy rolling. And growth of the economy in my mind is the only logical, super good way to lift all everybody's incomes across all sorts of sectors of the economy to have a growing economy. And what I see happening in Washington with Congress and the administration, along with what I see happening with the Fed, all speaks to killing the growth in the economy.

    "text": "a 50 stock portfolio, well, then I could diminish some of that corporate rest so that if a stock went down 20 on the open, it would only be one 50th of my portfolio or something like that. And I could deal with it and I could do that, but it just seems to me that if I instead want some tech stocks, I could go do XLK as a spider. It's the technology spider. And now I own all of these stocks and I don't have that corporate risk anymore. I just have an ETF that has a focus on technology. I buy it when it breaks out to the upside and I sell it when it goes to the downside. Now to answer your hedging question then. If I have 20, excuse me, 30 different sectors of all these things that range from energy sectors to even a junk bond sector, international, small cap, large caps, agricultural, all sorts of different sectors, I can be longed or I can go to cash on all of those. Well, as we start getting the stock market to cave in, the hedges go on. What I'm doing there is I'm using an ES index broadly diversified index short to go against all these individual sectors long. So what the way I do that is I look at what my exposure is the day I have to put the hedge on. And let's say I'm now down to 21 out of 30",

I calculate what that exposure is and I put on a hedge that balances that and I'm essentially out of the market. Got it. Yeah. Rather than do individual trades times 21, I can do one trade and get a pretty good clamping down on risk. We just one trade. It's super simple. Yeah, and that's actually the particular reason why I asked that question. So I know a lot of people that listen to this, they tend to manage smaller books, right? A lot of newer retail traders, they're probably 15 positions or less, but I think it's good for them to understand some of the tradeoffs that come when you can kind of create inherent diversification via all of the products you carry. But like you said, if we wanted direct hedges, sure, they're slightly more accurate, but then you have to run through all of these products and hedge them individually. Well, and you also have to be careful tax wise in the US. If you hedge something directly, then you could get into strange situations where the IRS could say, and I'm not a tax expert.

And I think it's like, you know, persistent inflation would basically hurt smaller companies like that pretty meaningfully, but a lot of people are speculating that the unwind will, you know, really lift them up a bit. Is that kind of what you're seeing or something else. I like to think that a small company and I was one when I was a money manager had 10 employees. I was small. And so the flexibility to do things a lot quicker and a lot faster and a little more innovative. You don't have to answer to, you know, a board of directors and a committee of 10 trying to find on every aspect of this particular decision. And there's a lot of advantage that a small company has versus a larger competitor, the large competitor on the other hand has staying power financing expertise, perhaps in house that they don't have to go outside of house to get. And so they can tend to squash some small competitors. And what I like to think of small cap stocks is if they're just in a same industry and competing for the same product and it's a generic product of some sort, there's nothing special there. I lean towards the liquidity of the larger company, because I think that then you have that ability to survive perhaps tough times. On the other side of it, if you have",

But there's two things that seems to always affect the long term of orange juice. One, it's the weather in Florida during the winter, because it seems like perpetually all the trips I've ever made to Orlando, I get there in the middle of January or something of frost hits. And everybody's got the smudge pots out and they're trying to warm up the air over top of the orange crop, the orange trees.
