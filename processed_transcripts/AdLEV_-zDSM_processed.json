So MOH is a really solid example that's showed strength and persistent strength. B and Y is another that has shown persistent strength. So if I show you these two names really quick to give you the example, MOH, you can see it's been on an absolute tear. It's actually taking out these near term highs and it's posting new highs. If we take a look at another example, B and Y, this is one that I've traded for a while now. And it's just because it's operating completely different and idiosyncratic to the rest of the market. So if you prefer to trade things to the long side, you can find them. But the holding duration for them is really nowhere near what it typically might be, at least for me. Because even if you take a look at this move here, this is gone from on the 18th to today. So 15 trading days, two weeks. That's a little bit actually on the longer side. Most of my directional holdings have been right around two weeks. So I didn't obviously bottom tick this. I've never really",

Most of my directional holdings have been right around two weeks. So I didn't obviously bottom tick this. I've never really bottom ticked anything in my entire life. But the entries and exits I take are typically breakouts, right, above prior congestion periods like this here is where I got on B and Y. So that's one way to approach things. The other way to approach things is finding different kinds of weakness. Now typically during a bearable a bull market, you have to look really carefully for weak sectors and then weak individual tickers within those sectors. And the reason why it's so important to structure it that way is because it's the inverse of what's happening now. Typically during a bull market, a lot of things can rally even generally just because the whole market's going up. So you have to be really selective. Now it's almost like a stone's throw and you're going to hit something that's going down, which makes it easier. But the way that I tried to time my downside trades is when the market starts to show rallies, like we saw last week. So if you see on Friday, there is a little bit of a rally happening in the SP 500 and same thing in the queues. The reason why that's an important",

The reason why that's an important days because what I do is I go inside the sectors and I see on those rally days, what tickers are just kind of treading water or even rolling over still. And those names become prime targets for shorts. And I'll give you an example of one of them that exists right now, which is CCL. So CCL was originally entered here on the fourth and then it was reentered on the sixth and then reentered on the seventh. So those are the series of different points where I've scaled in to CCL. And here's exactly why this one gets honed in on because this is something that's shown in uptrend and then it's something that is shown significant weakness against this near term broader market correction. This is a different approach than I typically apply when I'm attempting to stack strength for longer term ideas. If I'm trying to hold something for six months to a year, even three months, three months, six months to a year, this doesn't qualify for that kind of trade. So it's important to remember when we're talking about stacking strength, it is relative to the time frames of our trading. And if you",

And if you remember, the majority of my holdings right now for directional plays were less than a month, two to three weeks. So what that means is we actually have to zoom in way more. This is now my long term chart. A three month daily is the long term chart or something that I might hold for two, three weeks. And you can see that this has absolutely been showing significant weakness over this time frame. So then as we zoom into the more relevant time frames, the 30 day and then the 15 day typically, you'll see that it's been effectively just a one sided move down here. So now it's just follow the trend, but there are so many names that look like this right now. It is so easy to find things to trade to the downside. The important part is to make sure that you have good risk management. The cool part is with the broader market showing this kind of weakness. It actually gives you quite a bit of space in order to trade things differently. So for example, CCL, this is on via long puts, which I knowingly overpaid for a couple other trades that",

And geo is one of the ones that we reviewed together during I want to say one of the pro live streams not that long ago. So geo is one of them. Another that falls into that same bucket is ET phone home. ET is an example though of a ticker that actually would have been better via long puts. I didn't know that. So the way that I was trading ET definitely was via the volatility component here. You notice implied volatility in ET is 98. So a big part of what I'm doing here is just literally trading both the direction and volatility. But this I use this as an example to show you that again, like I've been doing this a long time. Anybody that pretends that they always make the right move and you know that that's it's complete bullshit.

Now for the broader portfolio, it's exactly what I needed, which is a big reason why I went into credit strategies. But there are two lenses to apply when we're evaluating stuff. So this now is also closing below its 200 AMA. Another really great filter to apply to identifying things that are going down are things that are just getting through their 200 AMAs because it's just like a bunch of names are just getting there now. Or other names that have fallen below a longer term moving average. In this case, this is a 100. You can use the 50s going to lag too long now. So you can't really rationalize using a 50, but using the gap between the 100 and a 200 is completely viable here to target things to the downside. So trades are literally abundant. I could not find more names if I tried. One of the other things to keep in mind is the volatility side of things.

But I'm talking about the change in zero DTE and one DTE trends over the last three years because daily's were launched in May of 22. And there's been a lot of different market movement over those time frames and profitability for the subsequent strategies. So the reason why I'm bringing this up is because one of the trades that I trade a lot is a weekend trade. Without going super far into the details, the crux of that is the weekend trade in SPX this week actually didn't work. But because volatility is so high, it still gave me an incredible chance to exit the trade and essentially reduce the max loss by 50. That's because of volatility. So one of the things to keep in mind is even what the market moving as it is, depending on the strategies that you use, some of them build in these little guard rails inherently because of the volatility component, which you're going to see more and more of. So just something to keep in mind is you're kind of going through your portfolios figuring out what you want to do and what makes sense, what might not make sense because the market writ large, I really, really believe is offering a lot of opportunities right now.

So just something to keep in mind is you're kind of going through your portfolios figuring out what you want to do and what makes sense, what might not make sense because the market writ large, I really, really believe is offering a lot of opportunities right now. But it's not always easy to dip your toe in if you're not used to seeing these things, which leads me to the last general point I wanted to mention, which is now is literally the perfect time to paper trade to test ideas, to see how things work, to try different ideas. And it's not just because we might not know how something behaves, it's also because it helps you build a data set using actual market conditions like this. And the reality, like I was telling you at the beginning of the stream, you don't see this many of these. So it's really important to get as much data for these as you possibly can. So what I'm doing right now is I've ramped up my paper trading data collection massively. And I have literally single, single one delta variance between the different strategies that I have on. So what that means is if the base strategy is me selling 28 put, 28 delta put, if the volatility is over a 30 threshold for this specific option, then I'm literally doing 28 27 26 25 24 23 literally all the way down and same thing up to a 50",

And it's because it costs me nothing. I literally just put them all on a paper trade and then I can monitor and see how they do. And then it allows me to conduct broader data analysis. And I can say, okay, when the VIX has moved from 15 to 20 over the course of X period of time, where do, where does that typically bleed out into the delta is that subsequently show optimal for whatever strategy it is that I might be looking at? It's just an example. So the message there is similar to what you've heard me say previously, but literally get everything you possibly can out of the experience, everything. If you are not paper trading right now and collecting data, I'm telling you, you are making a massive mistake, especially if you are trying to trade seriously, right?

So for those that don't know, this is forward slash ZT, which is a two year forward slash oops, forward slash ZN, which is a 10 year, I'm actually going to reorganize this ZT and then ZN. DB.

So if we use the 10 year and we zoom this out, it's still at like a really important crux. Now again, it's made a great move. So if you're one of the people that bottom ticked it here, that's great. That's absolutely fantastic move. But the way that I always look at this kind of stuff is if it starts posting higher, higher than this, then I become interested. So this is actually hit a couple alerts specifically the 10 year for me, but it hasn't really shown up to where I would enter in. Now the other entry point that did alert me, but I didn't enter was in here. And it was on a breakout against this. It would have been fine. It absolutely would have been fine. But one of the issues with bonds as of lately is you have to trade them very carefully because of how strange the relationship to equities has been. So it really depends on the longer term perception. Now I think trading it with leverage is okay, but that",

So it really depends on the longer term perception. Now I think trading it with leverage is okay, but that induces a significant timing element. Like your timing has to be pretty good. If you're trying to trade these with a kind of lazy timing based approach and you're just trying to get long bonds via a leverage GTF, that can start hurting really bad, really fast. And because this is still going to be highly, highly sensitive to the different inflation metrics that we get going forward. So the relationship between bonds and equities, I don't view it as normalized yet. I view it as trending towards normalized, but still not there. And I think because of that, trying to trade the direction and bonds, you almost have to look at it as just bonds. And the new paradigm and relationship for just bonds versus trying to say, well, equities are going down a lot of times that means you can go long bonds. I wouldn't feel super confident in that just yet personally. Ayo James, what up? Good to see you. Paulos says, what's propping up BMY? It's a great question.

Resectable or advanced epitome cellular carcinoma. To hell of a word, I do not pretend, by the way, to know how to say any of these fucking words. Obviously, I don't. Oh, whatever this is. I can say carcinoma. I know that one. But so that's a big price driver that you saw on the seventh. The medical sector in general has been showing a lot more strength.

Like there was a ton of stuff in the medical sector that's doing well. So they're also going through a little bit of like varied reasons for the group of these. But there's a little bit of periodicity to it. So you're capturing some of that. So I mean, a lot of these look strong. The Ab V is essentially hovering near 52 week highs. Another absolute killer. I'm not trading this one, but this one also looks fantastic. Now these look interesting from a short premium perspective because these don't tend to move a whole lot. So in order to build a position in these at least for me, you kind of have to size up because the total move severity is much lighter, which is fine. But with implied volatility at 90, I wouldn't be as jazzed to start getting a bunch of long calls or something here. So this is one that I would be looking via stuff like short puts and just trading the broader momentum. For sure. Paul says you bought just a plain long put.

Paul says you bought just a plain long put. I don't remember what we're talking about, but yeah, I buy single options all the time. Again, the way that I view single options for me is that I always mentally bucket them as diagonals because that's always the potential route that they'll go. The only place that I won't really bucket long options as diagonals is like if I'm trading something for an expected earnings move, which I really just bucket those is Dgen options, but we'll just see how it goes, which is typically not super well served. But yeah. Paul says our companies that breached 52 week lows are close to it. Good candidates for downside trends or downside trades. So, Paul, for your scenario, I think it depends on how you trade things to the downside. That's not like giving you a depends. It depends answer to not want to answer. It is because it really is highly relevant and I'll explain why. If we're looking for things, let's do just a price performance scan and I'll show you. We'll build Yeah, this one's fine. So, I'm going to do negative over a year. Yep, this is okay. And I want to show you the difference of behavior that you'll see in this group. So,",

And I want to show you the difference of behavior that you'll see in this group. So, first thing is let's take a look at different distances off of 52 week highs. And let's sort this by things that are essentially just hovering near lows like these. And let's take a look. So, I'm going to cite what I was just showing you. I'm just moving it off the screen so I can click through these faster. So, M A X N is one of them. Here's one of the issues that you will find with stuff like this. So, when you find things that make lows below 52 week lows, depending on what the company is, sometimes you will find weakness that is nearing a floor, a perceived floor of some type. So, then if something is hovering or establishing new 52 week lows, the way that it's doing that matters a lot. And depending on exactly the velocity and where the 52 week low is in relation. So, that's why 52 week lows, at least for my approach, tends to be a little bit too low, specifically for trying to trade like a big downside trend. 52 week lows is a good place for me when I'm hunting for things to sell short calls.

That's very common. But it's because things that tend to get down to 52 week lows, you're kind of late to the dance at that point. So, and it's, again, not saying that it couldn't be done, but it's just the way that I typically think of it and how I approach it. It's generally going to be a lower severity move potential for stuff like that. And again, this is in general. There are a lot of companies that over the last five years have had seen insane growth that then have a material change. So, there 52 week lows can be very high. And then if something is breaking through, it's 52 week low, that can just be the beginning of the party. But I'm just saying in general, like if you run a scan to look at a bunch of them, this is more the kind of stuff that you'll find, which is stuff that's just like really hovering near lows.

And let's say over the last year, we want something that's made at least five. And what I'll do is I'll modify this number so that we can look at different versions. All right, so let's...

So, this posting a new 52 week low, I think is entirely viable as a candidate. So, a way you can fix this in your scanning.

Because then, over the last five years, it's gained enough where over the last one year, it's now hitting lows. It means it still potentially has a ways to go to the downside. Whereas a lot of the other things that you will find near 52 week lows, if you scan for that outright, it's stuff that just kind of looks shitty. I mean, the interesting thing here is that if we zoom this out to a year, you can see how flat even the 200 day moving average is. So, I find that interesting because this new low is posted, like, immediately following earnings. Had a good earnings, too. It actually beat a little bit, which is interesting. So, yeah, super high implied volatility percentile, too. This actually looks like a good work call. Great. People are betting it to the upside.

I ended up not putting anything on in it in the primary count, just because it's way too small, but I ended up trading this one in my brother's account.

Did you do a market recap kind of in the beginning, not like the same market flow, like I typically do, just because I was mostly highlighting the specific relationships between stuff. Tommy says, Trump is trying to lower the 10 year bond yield. Yeah, I mean, Trump might want to do that, but with somebody like Trump, it's very important to listen to what he says and to kind of digest what he says, but then to also understand the reality and the implications of what he says. Because it's the same thing like one of the things that he talked about doing was ending the war in Ukraine within the first 24 hours of him getting into office, right? Like you have to understand that there's a bit of gamesmanship. So that's actually one of the, that's why you see so much volatility in the markets is because the markets is trying to do their absolute best to discern between the shit that matters a lot and is probably going to happen and Trump is taking seriously versus the shit that Trump is kind of just saying because that's what he does is say shit. So yeah, I think it's, I don't know if I would essentially take that as a trade idea personally.

No, I mean, that's about right. That's the nature of calendar spreads. The difference is is that again, it's like any other trade that you're doing to attempt to capture volatility is that it's going to take a directional tilt and it's really important at least to have a game plan. That's why most of us that will trade term structure of all, which I absolutely do. I'll give you an example of something like that. Let's see if we can find, normally it's stuff that has really distorted volatility. So let's see if we can find something that has high vol really fast. Let's do five volatility percentile. Let's see what this gives us. Let's take a look at MT. Yeah, 100 implied volatility percentile. Actually, this is a losing trade. I had, I got stopped out today because I traded it on this breakout above. I added to it and then gap down today. So that one's dead. But anyways, let's take a look at the vol in here.

And then the 42s in 20 June look expensive to us. 20 June, 42s, super wide bid aspect. That's actually why it's like this. The market price is stuff pretty well. So that's the reason why you see that peak. It's just a bit of spread gap. But we can eyeball what this might be. So 40, 30, 25, 55, 40. The the ask on this side is probably like 50 cents or 45 cents. So I would guess that this would actually be closer to like 40 cents. If you were to sell it, something like that.

Now I want to show you the downside of this though is because if you take a look at the delta's here, the and this won't be a 25 delta. By the way, the delta here will be much lower again. It's because the bid aspect is super, super contorted. But if we even just try to get a context of what the delta might be here for the 42s, let's just go to the one 93s and let's see what the 42s delta is. So it might actually be it's the oh no, because these are also super wide bid aspect as just super liquid. That's why. So anyways, the broader point being when you're trading these kinds of positions, right? And we're trying to gain exposure to the same strike across terms. You're going to have different Greeks that impact both of these differently. So the problem with that is that if we're shorter long the front month, it doesn't matter, right? The impacts will be different depending on the position. But depending on what you choose to do in the front month, it's going to have an accelerated Greek profile than the stuff that's further out in time.

But the stuff that's further out in time is going to have a higher Vega impact. So you have to have methods effectively to manage all of that if you're trying to actually isolate volatility. So yeah, absolutely can do, but it's a little bit challenging and it requires way more delta hedging. This is when I'm trading things like short straddles or strangles, I rarely will delta hedge. I'll kind of just run different bands. But beyond the bands, I widen the mouth quite a lot. Whereas if I'm trading things calendarized across terms, you kind of have to delta hedge a lot more. And that's just so that you can actually maintain the exposure that you're ultimately wanting to maintain. So I think he said that he was looking at slightly out of the money on Nvidia. I'm not sure which direction he means, down or up. But let's say that we're going on the call side. Let's see. So this, I'm just curious what it automatically has us do. It has us go into 25 April and 17 April. That's funny. The decent example anyways.

Especially resting at the same strike. You obviously have to find the same strike that you're interested in though. Because for example, if I take a look at the 15 strikes in Nvidia, just at a curiosity across these two terms, 25 and 17 April. And we take a look at the 115s, like they're priced appropriately. So the vol that you're going to collect here is going to be very different than the vol that you might be trying to collect, which again, depending on what kind of volatility risk is trying to capture, this will be a different trade than just trying to collect the elevated volatility in Nvidia if we think that implied is going to trend over realized or whatever. So it's a it's a different approach. Nothing wrong with it. It's going to move slow.

So this move here is literally profound. If I zoom this out to give you like a broader context over a one year time frame, like take a look at this severity of this move comparatively from here to here, like a 15 move over a month or so, which is again massive for gold. So this near term congestion doesn't surprise me. Even though that the market is showing a lot of weakness on a near term time frame, and it's literally because of how much this thing is moved otherwise. It's had such a massive move. So you kind of have to expect this to take a pause at some point, especially with the relationships also between equities and metals being a little bit distorted. Now, silver, I think, offers a slightly different value proposition, because silver has been notoriously lagging, but it's still not responding as well. So I think unless you have a direct position or hypothesis on silver directly, I don't think it's really suitable for something to offset an equity trade right now.

So I think unless you have a direct position or hypothesis on silver directly, I don't think it's really suitable for something to offset an equity trade right now. And then depending on again, what kind of move you might think you can get out of it. But silver has been so slow and boring that I haven't traded silver in quite some time. Now, one way you can trade silver is through the volatility, because silver maintains really, really steady risk premiums. So you can trade it from that lens. But yeah. Ben says, can you explain the different volatility metrics you're given by the platform? Sure. What volatility metrics are you referring to? Talk to me. I guess we'll just go back to this one. Which of all metrics, senior Ben? Mateusz says, what do we think of the continued bleeding of Tesla during aftermarket now at 215? Now, my biggest issue with Tesla is I closed out two-thirds of the short idiot. Go back to my example before of essentially never timing things the way that I want. There's a prime example of that. Stupid, stupid, stupid. Now joking aside, I think Tesla is just going to continue to get punished here. I mean, implied volatility is about as high as it can possibly get. So I think you're very likely to see that continueated move for sure. And then it looks like Ben is asking",

One second, let me grab the stream for you. This one. So Ben, this stream goes through all of that. I don't want to waste a bunch of time, just because people will be mostly familiar with it. But the way to think about it inside the chain, you have term-vol for the specific volatility. You have specific option-vol here. You have underlying vol here, which is IV, IV percentile. And again, the IV percentile is actually IV rank. But this is 30-day vol. That's what you see here. So that's like the cliff notes version of what you'll find. But that video goes through all of it more in detail. Scott says, GME crashing into earnings. Scott is shocked. I mean, I don't even think this is necessarily GME crashing, to be honest with you. I think that this is very much broader market is collapsing. The and GameStop is going for the ride. Most things right now are going for the ride.

It's trying to figure out how to use money. So it does not surprise me at all to see something like GameStop really cratering right now. In the broader context of the market.

The reason why it's wrong is because that leap reflects the current value and sentiment of Tesla. And the recent value and sentiment of Tesla is a stock that has gone, wait for it, it has gone down 55.7 over the last month and a half. So the reason why you see those relatively so cheap is because the stock has become relatively cheap compared to where it was before. So I think a massive part of what you see there is not them being actually cheap. It's them reflecting the current price, which is again, it's a really, really common error. New traders make or just inexperienced traders, I should say, it doesn't necessarily mean, doesn't necessarily mean new trader. And it's because the value of that option represents the what's going on with the stock.

But since that's not the angle you took, don't see it differently. And if we take a look at in terms of the overall value of it, and I assume when you say 12, 18, 26 here, if we take a look at this options chain, take a look at 75 vol, whereas the underlying upfront is 102 vol. So if you had framed your response as I think that this vol is cheaper relative to the stock vol, that would be an example of an objective lens where it is cheaper. But this is also very expensive relative to one expiration above it and a couple below it. So even this otherwise is expensive. So yeah, I wouldn't, I would retrain the way your brain thinks about cheap versus expensive because looking at it that way, just comparing something to its prior value, it really foregoes the analysis that needs to be done in terms of what is led to that change in value and why that's super, super important in this context. So good question though. All right, gang, it got me as two minutes over. I'm a pivot over star working on videos. If you need anything, let me know being out there. See you later.",
