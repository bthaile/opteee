    "text": "The worst possible time to determine when you should roll an option is when the trade is on. What that means is we should think about it ahead of time. So the goal of this video is to walk you through a formula on how you can think about rolling options. What the best time to roll an option is, but then most importantly, the different considerations you should think about as you're going through the process of rolling an option. Get right in. So very first thing is a market disposition. This is the same thing you'll see in most of my content. And it's because overviewing the market in your portfolio upfront is probably one of the most important steps you can take as a trader. It informs everything else that we're doing. So if I'm looking at any position and I'm thinking if I want to roll it, a big part of that is what do I think about the market? What do I think about the portfolio and how this position fits into the portfolio? All of that informs the way I think about rolling. Now a couple of other general concepts as it pertains to rolling first off, when we're referring to rolling most often, we're referring to a short option that is fallen in the money, meaning we would be closing it for a loss and opening a new trade. But that's just kind of colloquially speaking. Rolling can occur at any point in",

But that's just kind of colloquially speaking. Rolling can occur at any point in time. Rolling an option is simply when we close one, open another and we're tying the accounting to one another. It's nothing more than that. So you can roll winning positions, you can roll out of the money positions, you can roll bought or sold positions. It's just two transactions. Now for general context here and most often you're going to hear people rolling positions that they're defending something that's going against them. So that part of side, we have kind of our first step out of the way. What's the next step? Well, this is one that most people overlook and it's probably one of the most important things they need to ask themselves, should you be in this trade? A lot of people have a position that they put on. It starts to go against them and then they're like, ah, I got to defend this. But maybe we're just wrong. Maybe the best move is actually to get out of the trade, not tie up capital into something that's not working and then to deploy our capital somewhere more logical.

So the way to think about this is first, I don't like the question of what I put the position on now because that assumes that over the entire life cycle of a trade that you would have optimal entry points. And that's just not real. That's not how trading works. Even trades that are working, there's very commonly instances where I wouldn't put that trade on right now. So I actually don't like that. I get the idea and it's designed to get you to do this, but as usual, I prefer to get a little more specific. So the real question I have is am I defending loser just because of my ego and because I don't want to have a losing trade or is there a logical reason behind it? That is the question to ask here. And we'll get into an example in just a couple minutes. The next piece we have is this, which is what is the optimal time to roll? Well, in an ideal world, your optimal time to roll would be when the stock price is the same as your strike price and there's no extrinsic value remaining. This is a Goldilocks scenario. You're essentially never going to see this. It could happen, but it's insanely infrequent. Most often",

You're essentially never going to see this. It could happen, but it's insanely infrequent. Most often though, you're going to have a point in time where your short option, again, just using kind of that general scenario, is the same price as the stock. So let's take a look at an example that I have on right now. If you take a look at IWM, you'll notice that I'm short the 199 puts. This is part of a covered strangle. These are at a 20 delta. So these are actually working for me beautifully, a rare scenario. But let's say, now that I'm talking about, it's probably going to happen. Let's say that these short puts end up at the money. What you'll notice is when they're at the money, there's actually the most extrinsic value the option is going to have. So in terms of data decay perspective, there's a lot of time value that needs to come out of these options and there's a lot of extrinsic value that you don't necessarily want to buy back if you've sold it. That's the idea of selling a put is to collect time value. However, the other thing you'll notice is there are a lot of choices available to roll. So these have 10 days left.",

Let's say that these actually fell to the at the money and they're trading around where these 204s are right now, which is like 242, something like that. So if I take a look, let's just even go out one cycle to 20, let's go a little further. Let's go to 28 March. And you'll notice that I can already roll them down. I can get them further away from the money and I can still collect a small credit so I can decrease my basis in this scenario hypothetical from 204 to 203. This is the ideal scenario. And again, this is assuming your short puts are being challenged. Now, you'll notice though that you're buying back a ton of extrinsic value. So that has to be part of your equation and we'll get a little further into that later. The reason why it's important to know when optimal, what's the goalie lock scenario? is so that we can then understand the trade offs that we're actually going to be facing as we go through this example.

So let's take a look now at a quick decision tree using this IWM position that I have on. So I'm going to start with the market and the portfolio. The first thing I'm looking at from the market is has my market disposition materially changed from the time I entered the trade to now. And if it has, it might require a change in position in its entirety. Then I'm going to look at the portfolio. Here, I want to get a sense of what different decisions impact the portfolio as a whole. So again, for example, let's say that if I look at my portfolio, I have tons of positions that are expiring the 28th of March tons. Maybe instead of rolling these out to that same expiration cycle, I could get a little bit of diversity in expirations that I have exposure to. And instead of going to this 28 March, maybe that informs my decision making to go out to the 5 April or the 12 April. So some of this is going to be fed by what do you think about the market as a whole, but then most importantly, how does this fit into your portfolio? Are there any guidelines or implications from either of these that inform your decision making? Then we have the trade",

Are there any market moving announcements coming up that I have to be aware of? So in this case, if the thesis has not changed, then we're okay for a role. If the thesis has changed, maybe we need to change the position. Am I at risk of early assignment? If yes, that tells me I need to do something sooner rather than later. A way to think about early assignment is pretty simple. If I had, again, short puts, but let's say I had short puts that were all the way in here like the 230s. Notice that there's only like two pennies of extrinsic value. These become more and more likely to be reassigned once they're, you know, sub-adigm definitely sub-nickle in extrinsic value left. So you have to consider that. How many days are left? So one of the things is we talked about in the beginning. If I'm selling premium, I want time to pass. So if I have a whole bunch of days",

And it's super far out in time. But at this point, the stock price equals a strike price. I can make a meaningful basis adjustment. Maybe it being a little further out in time then doesn't matter to us when we make the adjustment. There's some ideas that go behind this, which we'll talk about. And then announcements is simple. Do we have something coming up that can potentially hurt us? How does that inform or decision making? Okay, let's talk about the analysis now. So we already talked about the stock equals strike. What's going to happen here is you're going to have the greatest choices in strike selection. And here's why. If we take a look at this again, 10 DTE, the further you go on the money, the more intrinsic value there is, the less extrinsic value there is. So when you buy this back, it's becoming increasingly expensive, but there's less extrinsic value that you're getting for",

So when you buy this back, it's becoming increasingly expensive, but there's less extrinsic value that you're getting for these. So let's say if I wanted to roll these two tens that are trading, let's call it six ten. So the two tens are trading for six ten. If I go out to that same expiration that we were looking at before, the 16 DTE from 10, and I go to those two tens, notice how I can't improve my basis anymore. I can't get a net credit here. These are only trading for five seventy five, five seventy eight. So because they're too far in the money and there's too much intrinsic value, I've now lost the ability to go out as short as I could before and collect a credit. I'm stuck at the strike unless I want to go further out in time. So this is why when the stock price equals the strike price, you love the most variability in terms of strike selection, but you're going to be paying the most extrinsic value. So the first question that comes into my mind here and the most important one in my opinion is actually this one right here. What is my preference towards inventory?

Really, this series of trade-offs here, which we'll touch on in a second. If I don't care about inventory, then I might feel a little bit differently. Expiration liquidity is another part of this puzzle. If we take a look at expirations, even in something like IWM, that has a bunch of them. Notice how we can go from one day, three day, six day, eight, 10, 13, 16, 24, 31. So what's happened here? Here we're going in two day increments. Then we go two day again, but then all of a sudden we start going out full weeks. Then you'll notice it goes 38, 45, 45 to 66, 66 to 101. What I'm showing you is expiration liquidity. The way that these expirations are thought up is based on liquidity and near-term options, even with weaklies, will have more expirations the closer into time you get, typically within 60 days. But once you get outside 60 days, then the date windows start to jump massively. In this case, you have 49 days until you get to the next cycle. This can be even worse",

So if you're trading something like QLD, notice you don't have that many choices. You go from three to 38 to 129. So expiration liquidity is actually a really important part of this puzzle because my general disposition is to go as little far out in time as I can. Here's why. If I'm in the position of defending something that's not going in my favor, so if we zoom this out more and I'm going and I'm trying to fight this thing that's going in the wrong way, you have a couple of choices. You could go really far out in time, get a bigger basis adjustment. But then if it keeps going down, what's happening in that scenario is, let's say you rolled it from this 10 to the 45, you get a really nice basis adjustment, but let's say it keeps plummeting. Well, now you can't really adjust your basis as much because now instead of just being able to jump 30 days, you're going to have to jump increasing periods of time that kind of lock you into holding the position, even though something could be nose diving.

And what that means is let's take a look at this example again. If I go in this trade and again, let's say that we have these 204s, let's say that you choose to roll out to this 16 DTE. So this 204, you would make more money if you kept it right here at the 204 because you would collect more extrinsic value. However, your basis would be the same. So if you wanted to roll out and then down to get away from being at the money, and this is the same for the call side, then all of a sudden you're collecting less theta.

If I'm trying to more aggressively adjust my basis, that tells me I'm going to sacrifice how much money I potentially am going to make in extrinsic value because I'm trying to get a bigger change in my basis. The time value left in the options is always a tricky prospect. I prefer to let as much time value run away as I can. However, again, if you do that and something falls too far in the money, that's when you get stuck and you can't adjust your strike over your basis anymore.

And then the last thing here is reminding us about that DTE liquidity. The reason why I go from the 10 to the 16 is because it lets me slowly move my way out while I'm accelerating by the highest portion of theta decay. Because again, if we look at these two or threes, two or fours, they're moving at a dime a day in theta. If I go out to this 38 DTE and I go to the at the money, they're only losing six cents of theta, way less. So if my goal is to be spot price sensitive and maintain as much expiration liquidity as I can, meaning if I roll to this 16 and then five days in, it's not going well. I can roll it again out to that would be the 19 at that point instead of the 24 DTE. I have a lot of choices if things go against",

So for example, if I wanted to get a really big basis if we go to this 10 DTE and we buy these two or fours back in for 242 and we go 38 DTE out, notice you can go all the way to the 199s and get 242. You can get a few pennies in extrinsic value back to roll for break even or a slight net credit. But you're moving your basis five bucks from two or four to 199. So this is a way you can get a more meaningful basis adjustment. But again, then if you want to roll again, you're not able to go from 10 to 16 DTE. You're going to have to go from 38 to 45 or whatever else is there. So it's a big consideration to make. This is the general process that I follow. I'm going to look at the market, the portfolio review the trade, make sure it still makes sense that",

I'm going to look at the market, the portfolio review the trade, make sure it still makes sense that there's nothing coming up that alerts me. Then I'm going to go through this series of analysis. How do I feel about inventory? How do I feel about making an aggressive adjustment to my basis or not? And then where's the best profit potential I have affordable to me? And what keeps me most adjustable to the market that I'm obviously defending against again using this general scenario? If you have any questions, let me know. Like, subscribe, share, be an outlier.
