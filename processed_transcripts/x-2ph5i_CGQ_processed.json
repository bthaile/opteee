    "text": "the worst possible time to determine when you should roll an option is when the trade is on what that means is we should think about it ahead of time so the goal of this video is to walk you through a formula on how you can think about rolling options what the best time to roll an option is but then most importantly the different considerations you should think about as you're going through the process of rolling an option let's get right in so very first thing is a market disposition this is the same thing you'll see most of my content and it's because overviewing the market in your portfolio upfront is probably one of the most important steps you can take as a Trader it informs everything else that we're doing so if I'm looking at any position and I'm thinking if I want to roll it a big part of that is what do I think about the market what do I think about the portfolio and how this position fits into the portfolio all of that informs the way I think about rolling now a couple other general concepts says it pertains to Rolling first off when we're referring to Rolling most often we're referring to a short option that is fallen in the money meaning we would be closing it for a loss and opening a new trade but that's just kind of colloquially speaking rolling can occur at any point in time",

    "text": "I can meaning if I roll to this 16 and then 5 days in it's not going well I can roll it again out to that would be the 19 at that point instead of the 24 DTE I have a lot of choices if things go against me I'm collecting less money up front because I'm going out very little in time but I want to go out as little in time and possible while achieving whatever my broader objective is for the role so for example if I wanted to get a really big basis adjustment if we go to this 10 DTE and you know we buy these 204s back in for 242 and we go go 38 DTE out notice you can go all the way to the 199s and get 242 you can get a few pennies in extrinsic value back to roll for Break Even or slight net credit but you're moving your bases five bucks from 204 to 1.99 so this is a way you can get a more meaningful basis adjustment but again then if you want to roll again you're not able to go from 10 to 16 DTE you're going to have to go from 38 to 45 or what whatever else is there so it's a big consideration to make this is the general process that I follow I'm going to look at the market the portfolio review the trade make sure it still makes sense that there's nothing",
