    "text": "You ask I answer. We have three questions from Zach. We're going to hit the first one in this video, and it is why are there often large options orders right before closing? I'm assuming to minimize theta decay. Money and off, it's actually not due to that assumption, although it's a great guess. This, however, is a fantastic observation that we see large option orders right before the closing. I'll actually notice this with stocks as well. If we plot a time series of just typical volume, and this is the open, and this is the close, what you'll find is volume typically starts off real hot. And then it kind of trails off into the midday, and then the last hour or so real hot again. And this is for a bunch of different reasons, which we'll talk about. The very first one is the simple auction process. And this is where, when we have specific order types like market on close, or VWOP orders for algorithmic, trading a lot of these are done towards the end of the day. So during this process, they're matching these with counter parties, and that time frame is generally constrained at the beginning slash end of the day. Part of it is a natural self-fulfilling cycle, where these periods tend to be more liquid due to some of these reasons, and then other people say, well, I'm just going to transact during these periods with my larger orders, because other people",

The other thing is that if we have things like earnings releases, or if we have some sort of catalyst, what ends up happening is we want to gain either specific exposure or hedge specific exposure around the event itself. So you wait, because you don't put your trade on earlier in the day, because it has other factors that you're not really trying to trade, you're trying to isolate these effects. And again, this happens both to speculate, and also to hedge during those. Great observation, we will hit the next two, in a follow-up video, being out there, see you later.",
