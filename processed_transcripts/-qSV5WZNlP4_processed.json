    "text": "you you Storm rocks The into best time to be back if there ever was nobody comes back like we do. The markets continue to just be absolutely haywire today was no different. So the game plan for today is actually to spend a little bit of time just exploring the markets with you all. I still don't really consider myself fully back in terms of my understanding of things I'm getting deeper, but it takes a little time just to saturated. And that's that's kind of how it goes. I started monitoring the markets much more closely last week. And I don't know, I guess maybe another 15 hours, 20 hours or so. And then I should be in a pretty good spot with what I want to get caught up on. The next thing on my agenda for those wondering is going through the economic indicators that we've had over the last couple weeks. And not just looking at the numbers, but actually pulling up the reports and seeing what's in there. And then doing that going forward for the next four weeks or so, I try to keep a general understanding of trading is funny in that way because there are a lot of different time frames that impact us in different ways. So you have to be aware, even if you're trading something like as a shorter term time frame, you still have to be aware of what's going on in slightly longer term time frames",

We're also in a really busy time of year with earning season well underway. And actually, it's a much welcome source of returns right now because I was talking with somebody earlier today. And there's a good chance that this month will mark a negative year-to-date return on the coverage triangle strategies, which actually really, really rare. But because of that, the speculative trading has become more and more and more important to continue driving overall return performance because I haven't fully rotated out of the coverage triangle. I always maintain some exposure there. It's a little excessive right now based on the fact that the market was down another 2 today before the end of the day. But all those details integrated, it means that it requires us to do a lot of different things. And I want to spend a little time taking a look at that with you guys.

And as Tommy rightly and very cool, he mentioned here, we did cross 30,000 subscribers on YouTube, which is, is always I say it every time because it becomes increasingly crazy to me that the number continues to grow. I am not optimized in any significant way for YouTube, but it tells me that there is a group of people out there that are interested in how we do things. And kind of this thing I call the outlier mindset, not like the super niche thing. It's accessible to everybody, but it is something that you kind of have to embody on a day-to-day basis. So having a community of people that are interested in that is super cool. It's something I absolutely wish I had access to because if you look across most trading communities, it's all about people trying to figure out how much money they can make, how fast with minimal effort.

Trading as I will always remind people is a terrible, terrible endeavor to treat as a hobby. It really is because for most people that try to treat trading as a hobby, they're making such a series of suboptimal choices. And there's it's all trade-offs.

And it's really just a chance to talk about some of the more interesting wins and losses, as you all know, I typically prefer to talk about the losses. I genuinely find them much more interesting. But we'll talk a little bit about both. And the whole concept behind war stories is war stories are never just kind of run of the mill, you know, at least in the military. When people are telling war stories, it's typically like really interesting stuff. It's not going to be anywhere near as interesting as this stuff you'll hear in a true war story. But in a trading war story, it'll be a little bit more of the extremes that I actually don't talk about that much. And there's a really specific reason why I don't talk about the extremes that much.

There's a series of trades that I made a couple years ago. And unfortunately, I'm still not ready to go into any significant detail. But I am going to at least overview some of them for you because it still hands down as a gross dollar amount, the most profitable two days I've ever had my entire life. It's like multiples of most people's annual salaries over the course of two days. Just some of the most interesting things I've ever seen. But we'll talk a little bit about those on Wednesday.

If I like did the math on like what that amount of money would have been on like a per hour basis, I'm actually not very curious. It's probably below minimum wage. Like if I, no, I don't think, let me look, I'm so curious now. One sec. Yeah, it's literally like minimum wage. That's actually hilarious. So if I look across my entire trading career, the return on that time is not great. But obviously, that's not the only return I've had over this time. Fun nonetheless. All right, let's get into the markets. Shall we? I think there's a couple high level items that I believe are worth starting with. The main thing here is the relationship that you see with VIX. It is absolutely clustering around this 30 handle. Interestingly enough, bonds are still doing terrible. I'm surprised to see bonds down as big as they were today. And this goes back to this really inconsistent relationship between equities and long term bonds, I should say, given the current market environment.

Let me know if you guys can see me, it told me I disconnected, but it looks like it's back. Oh, hold on. Okay, cool. Thanks, Russ. So looking at markets like this, it gives you a lot of underlying context on whether or not we're in a healthy market environment or an unhealthy or abnormal. And I would still consider this to be pretty abnormal. So what happened today? Today was an insane move. Actually, speaking of losses, I got smashed today on my intraday SPX positions. And funny enough, it's actually the first day that I sized up another increment based on market conditions. It's the psychology of a human trader is epically funny to me because all of the conditions based on the strategy performance were there based on what I look for. And then I was looking back over the previous trades and I was just like, man, this is like a pretty long win streak that I've had with this specific strategy.

And I knowingly put on this trade, I sized it up following the general plan against my gut, which is saying, don't do it. And I'm glad I did it, but it was a full loss. So it's well, I guess for what the trade was, it was full loss today. It was perfect. The exact thing that you want as soon as you size up a strategy. Now joking aside, there is an important lesson I want to share here. And that lesson is sometimes following the plan for the right reasons is better than breaking away from the plan, potentially making money, which is the entirely wrong reason. There's a really delicate balance between this gut instinct element as a trader, especially if you're discretionary trader, which almost, I mean, the overwhelming majority of retail traders are discretionary because it's very difficult to be purely algorithmic. You have to strike a healthy balance between like those gut instincts, fears, senses that you have versus what you actually ultimately end up doing.

And funny enough, I genuinely am starting to get to the point where on some of the deviations, I literally might start allowing a little more gut intervention, but there's a broader problem. I suspect if I do that. And the problem I suspect if I do that will be as I do it, the propensity for me to want to intervene will actually go up. And then right now, the slightly positive performance that I see from those gut interventions probably would normalize to either flat or negative. Now, the thing to keep in mind is I'm not talking about deviations from like a fully specific automated strategy to then deviating off of it. Pretty much everything that I do already has discretion, but I have discretion that's baked within boundaries. And sometimes I look to violate those boundaries for one reason or another. It's just a fascinating, absolutely fascinating, just like processing of information. It's something that I find to be like legitimately incredible with the human mind, how it processes that stuff, but also how fallible it is. So this move that you saw on CLT",

So this move that you saw on CLT unhealthy compared to equities, the move that you saw today was unhealthy. The move today was kind of nuts if you think about it. Now, it's not nuts in the context of, I mean, we're still in a declining channel, right? Like that's as clear as day. There's no ifans, buts about that. Like that is what it is. This is absolutely declining channel. Now, the way that this starts to behave around this 4963, handled down here matters quite a lot if it gets back down there. The reason why that matter so much is because this is still in a spot where it can start challenging prior highs, local highs, and reestablish at least interim uptrend. But right now, this is a resumption of the downtrend. I actually have some broad short deltas directly in the indices. And part of that is because it's a slightly better hedge for me than trying to play the movement of volatility for those that don't know. There's a lot of different ways you could play volatility, but volatility is its own thing and it behaves very differently. So if you choose to try to hedge, let's say for example, a broad",

So for me, it is a hedge, though, to be very, very clear. A lot of times I say that I might be playing something to the other direction based on the broad market tilt simply to say, oh, weird, how does he keep doing this? So it keeps disconnecting and reconnecting. We might need to do, what can I do here? It seems fine. I'm going to close OBS really fast and then I'm going to see if I can run it as admin, make it a little more important. Oh, actually, give me a second. Maybe if I bump it up in Tasmin. Oh, here we go. All right, so I just up the priority and see if that helps. That is honestly super weird, really, really weird that it's being that inconsistent. We'll see if this helps.

So I definitely want to scrub some of those deltas off and the other big stuff I'm working on is kind of what we talked about during the pro stream yesterday. Most of that is earnings plays. I have a couple directional plays that I put on today. The portfolio still isn't fully where I wanted to be in terms of total utilization, but it's much closer. So it's about, I mean, I could do nothing now and it would be about right, but I still would like to scale a little bit more. So that is the near term game plan for the broader portfolio. Now all that aside, let's take a look at the actual move today. I really was interested in it. So you can see that there is this just massive dump right on the open. And then I mean, it just absolutely continued this trend all the way until like 1105 ish 11105. And then it had a pretty abnormal move outside of here. So if you take a look at this move in here, this was a 1.25 move. That's a big move in and of itself. But then if you think about the",

And then it rallied back up about 1.25. That is a fairly significant range on the day. And I think a big reason why you're seeing this kind of volatility stepping into the equation has a lot to do with how the market has positioned. And there's still pure uncertainty around pretty much all of this. And I think that's important to pay attention to because this idea of like the Trump tariffs being paused for 90 days and the original market reaction to that, it's showing you that it's not enough. And it's actually starting to notice more fear on top of that. The talking points you'll see for today is because of Trump challenging the independence of the Federal Reserve. Like you could see that from page here. Here's the problem. There's no freaking change to this. Trump has been doing this and talking this way to Powell and about the Fed since before he was elected.

Trump has been doing this and talking this way to Powell and about the Fed since before he was elected. So this in my opinion is another example where we're looking for a clean talking point to tie things to. And I actually think a big driver of what happened today has to do with positioning. And I think the positioning is likely to continue to ebb and flow as it is, especially as we go through earnings because we're now getting a pretty good look into how companies are surviving. And it's tenuous. The forecasts that we're getting right now are all pretty soft. And you're still seeing the same kind of broad flows that you might expect during a constrained market. And I'll show you what I mean by this. So let's grab here. No, this isn't what I want it. Now this isn't. Oh, I got to sign in one sec. Here we go. So take a look at this. If you take a look at the SP 500 in terms of overall positioning, it has been sold off heavily, absolutely heavily for the last like two months consecutive. The broad market I think is still continuing to unwind a lot of these positions. If you take a look at the broad changes on the day, even staples is starting to come off.

If you take a look at the broad changes on the day, even staples is starting to come off. The reason why staples coming off matters is because this is where a lot of people go to try to find a safe haven during challenged markets, meaning we don't really know what's going to go on. We think that it might be more likely for a recession, all of these sorts of things. And this starting to tail or down is absolutely broad speaking, big sign of weakness. The fact that the outflows accelerated this heavily in terms of across the various sectors, real estate doesn't really surprise me that people are starting to try to move a little bit of money into real estate, just because it does start to become slightly more interesting here with the yields it can provide. I don't think that we're looking at this in terms of housing crisis coming up. I still think mortgage and mortgage performance doesn't look that bad, but let's see, I haven't looked.

Like quite surprising to me. Ah, take a look at this. The consumer credit card balance is starting to rise up actually pretty significantly. Mortgage originations is about flat. These two are about lunch. There's not anything there that's drawing my attention. This is the other that I wanted to look at. So personal consumption is going up.

So let's take a look really quick and see if there's anything that sticks out to us from that lens. And then I want to take a look at a couple stocks specifically with earnings coming up. So let's see. Let's get rid of, let's go to just 2025, we'll compare it against last year. And Joseph is seeing more houses for sales signs. Yeah, I mean, it looks like what you're seeing so far. Tracks. Because essentially new sales is gone up. 2 from the start of the year and it's now up 3.8. So I think that that's. That seems to be right. Sale prices are still going up. They're still going up like handedly. Wow. So yeah, it does look like things definitely are coming up more for sale.

The way that they look at it is if you maintain decent cash opportunities are going to be popping up. And this is even something that I'm doing right now with the real estate side of what I do. A lot of the properties that we have we're still looking to build and expand them as best as we can. But we're not looking to take on a bunch of debt here because of the cost of the debt. It's just not worth it. So most of the stuff that we're doing is being internally financed. Now, one of the things that I do keep an eye on, it's kind of like bargain shopping is looking for distress sellers because especially in the commercial real estate world, there's a certain amount of money that you have to maintain in order to even continue business, manage pay rolls. And if that kind of funding dips too low, it puts you in a really bad spot where you have to start scaling critical components that you otherwise really don't want to or shouldn't for the sake of your business.

And I don't have the spare cash to feed into it to maintain it. So those kinds of places sometimes can come across as distressed sellers, which generally you can get better deals for because it's not quite a fire sale every time, but frequently it is a little bit more of a fire sale. But you're also going to be picking up something that's slightly challenged and you kind of know that going into it. So I think real estate right now is going to continue to show a little bit of that now of note. However, I do think that you're going to see as always real estate buy for Kate. It's very regional. And I think you're going to continue to see things like office buildings, for example. Now, return to office is actually been a bigger deal than I think some people expected it to be, but as long as that continues to be as it is, then it is quite likely to see office buildings themselves struggling, but that opens the door for office building conversions.

Now, so far, there's been, if you checked out my newsletter from the past week, I shared some of the recent earnings statistics and just general data for your context. And there's still a lot of overall beats, but beats become expected. It's really important to understand how earnings work. And it's worth it's worth a quick revisit as a collective. So let's look at an example here. Let's say that you have stock Apple or XYZ, whatever we have Apple. And of Apple, the reason why I'm using a stock like this is because it's going to be highly covered. There's going to be a lot of analysts. Let's say each one of these nodes is an analyst that covers Apple. Here's what happens. All of these different banks. The first thing to note, number one, is a lot of them directly hold Apple. The second thing to note, a lot of their clients hold Apple. This is what we would call a conflict of interest. If I'm going to try",

Does that mean that that conflict of interest every single time leads to some sort of fuckery? No, because a lot of them will maintain a longer term position in Apple. And thus, that means they're actually highly incentivized to analyze it well. What fuckery comes afoot is, let's say one of them is looking to pay her down their position in Apple. Well, you need exit liquidity. How can you generate exit liquidity? You can have something that beats your expectations massively leads to a lot of people saying, oh, wow, this smashed to the upside. Let me go buy Apple. As people are buying it up, one of these places can be selling it into that buying pressure. There's your exit liquidity. That kind of stuff. It's just important to note that that exists. To what degree it goes on, I genuinely don't know. But I know that the conflict of interest is there.

So anyways, we have all these different analysts. Let's say Apple, if everybody does their absolute best due diligence, let's say that they think Apple's going to make a dollar for share. Well, what ends up happening is let's say that your best analysis, the absolute best analysis you can come up with, this is what you really think it's going to be as a dollar. And then all of a sudden, you put in your dollar and it comes in short for whatever reason it comes in at 95 cents. Well, what happens? We've conditioned the market now to think that this is a big giant miss in that leads to big massive down moves. Well, that doesn't look good if you're holding the stock. And if maybe you're coming up on a quarterly outpourief and you need to show your performance for the past quarter, if Apple's down, that's not good.

And it's not because they can't figure it out. They fucking can if they're someone client. And I'm sure they do internally. But the reality is there's also a shaming function. If best estimate is a dollar and let's say all of these different nodes save for this node come up with a dollar. And this node says, you know what? I think it's going to be a dollar five for whatever reason. Well, if it comes in close to this dollar, this dollar five now sit just sticks out like a sore thumb completely fucked it up. Everybody else, the rest of the pack stays together. So then what happens? Let's say everybody instead came up with a dollar and it came in at a dollar five. What happens?

So the reason why all of this matters is because when you're analyzing earnings, when you see an actual beat that is essentially a hit, it's what they should be doing. And it's because of the way that analysts produce their targets and it's become this generalized expectation that there's going to be a beat. So this is also why you'll see different reactions to beats and misses. The reason why is because the overall expectations for a beat, the market thinks most names are going to be. So then when you have something that misses, if we know that we graded them with kid gloves, so to speak, and then there's a miss, that's a massive problem. So the game of trading earnings is really interesting from a psychological perspective in terms of understanding what's going on under the hood. But then there's the fun part of this, which includes trading the actual earnings releases themselves. And again, yesterday during the pro livestream, we looked through a few of these.

HAL ended up being the primary name. So let's take a quick look. They report before the open tomorrow, but let's take a quick look at their options so that we can do a little bit of analysis together. So the first thing is coming into this. The stock price on the closes 2192. The expiration volatility is 80.47. What I'm doing is I'm calculating the event specific the ticker ball is 51.13. 51.13 and day's expiration at this point is four. So the event volatility for this itself is about 134.4. The expected move for that takes it to 6.77 with an event expected move of roughly 1.48. This is tracking it at 1.14. It's a little bit light, a little bit too light, by the way. So if we take a look at the options chain here, I typically run things around the 20 delta on something like this. You're still collecting over a percent. There's no reason to spread these off, although it definitely can move. We can see after hours right now, it's not really doing a whole lot. It's kind of sitting tight.",

These get put on literally right before the close. So these will see what happens. Now in terms of how I choose to manage them tomorrow, that will be highly dependent on what the market looks like, but overwhelming majority of instances is going to be at least waiting the first 15 minutes for that vol to bleed out, and then we'll make some decisions from there. So now the other thing that I think is worth looking at are a couple of the names for tomorrow after the close. There's a couple that looked good. Definitely not Tesla, but I want to look at Tesla. Tesla we passed on our screen yesterday for a bunch of different reasons, but I just want to see what this is pricing in as well. Those stock price 227.5, X-Preval 145.55, picker, vol 94.9, DTE 4, 240 in a quarter event vault that puts us at 12.11, the expected move. This is calculating is like 27.54.

So this is still way too light. And that's actually one of the things that we saw when we were pricing it yesterday was if I grab O-Rats again really quick, the overall vault was priced way, way, way too cheap. Let's see what this shows us. So this is pricing in X, yes, see it's right now it's pricing an expected move of 9.8 with an average actual move of 10.1. So 0.3 edge to the implied vault side with everything that's going on with Tesla to me seems like a bad trade. Now that doesn't mean that it can't, again, it can any one of these individual names despite all this shit that I'm saying could always work perfectly, but you have to remember the entire scope of a trader's lens is not how does this one individual thing work out. It's always how do or how does this approach work out in the long run over thousands and thousands of occurrences. So it's really important as you hear me talk about this stuff. It's not so much predictive.

Now if you take a look for the volume today, there is a lot of sold puts coming in at the bid. That's actually kind of interesting. Let's take a look at the volume. I want to actually look at what the true behavior was. I don't just care about the numbers. That's why I'm saying. The volume itself is useful from a gross number perspective, but it's limited because we also want to see the dollar amounts. The dollar amounts matter a lot. So let's see. Yeah. So, so a lot of earnings plays. Take a look at this. So if you take a look at the earnings across the board, this is a lot of wow. Let's see. I want to get a sense of what the movement was. It was like dollar deltas. Look at. What am I filtering? I try to use more narrow filter. Why? Is it because there's too many names? Let's just take a look at. And let's sort this.

This kind of positioning absolutely will cause ripples in the underlying. This is pretty significant. Overall, long side premium today was what? 750 mil against 789. So slight edge to bear side plays of some sort. You can't really categorize it quite like that. They just do. But there's some limitations with doing that. That's real interesting. Let's take a look through a couple of the things really fast. I got each month. I do an AMA on Reddit. And I do it in the option sub because I remember when I was an enterprising options trader trying to learn going into different online forums. How difficult it was to find things one that I trusted. And then two people that weren't kind of assholes. So I tried to at least offer a different perspective for people.

And before we do that, two other things, one of them. I recently launched a mini series for the Friday stream, which is outlier options trading foundations. The purpose of the Friday mini series is to try and provide what I consider to be the correct foundation, bedrock, to even begin learning about options or trading in general. So it's not going to be highly tactical. Always use this delta. Always buy, always sell. It's none of that stuff. It's going to be trying to help you understand how to even think about solving this problem set and how to solve it in a logical order and the kind of things you need to do in order to solve the problem set of figuring out how to trade. A lot of traders mistakenly start running down the path of what stock should I trade? What expiration should I trade? What technical analysis indicator should I use? And the reality is those are literally literally all the wrong questions to worry about upfront. They don't fucking matter at all at that point. What matters upfront is developing a rock solid foundation to be able to iterate off of. Because here's the next thing I literally can guarantee you.

The only way you're going to be able to identify that though and then successfully pivot is if you have a good foundation to then work off of to then iterate. So it'll be for the next four Fridays. I'm planning four weeks. I'm actually really looking forward to this one because a lot of the outlier options trading basics and boot camps that we do is more about like the tactical what is an option and that kind of stuff which we'll get back to those. I do a couple of those per year. But this one is really designed to be a little more meta but with very specific takeaways after each module that we do. So I think it'll be useful. The second thing is in a broad nutshell with markets how they are right now. I cannot express how important I think it is to try and move slow to test ideas.

And if you find yourself oversized just in terms of your overall portfolio utilization now, the ability to get absolutely smashed is you have to be aware of that you have to be aware of that. If you're not aware of that you're really putting yourself in a dangerous spot. So something to keep in the back your mind as you go through these kinds of markets there's nothing wrong with testing ideas. But it is important to test ideas logically and to monitor your size carefully because it is very easily very easy to get oversized. And if the market decides to just continue to rotate over and roll down which it absolutely can do it seems more likely right now than it doesn't based on the current information that's out there. It's important to remember the average bear market borrowing the 2020 bear market because it skews the data so much because it was one day is 298 days a long time.

Yeah so cues is literally just that a bear market now. 20 down 20 that's on the close. So cues is there and spy I think is close but not quite. 16.4 so deep correction for spy. The reason why I'm mentioning this is it's not even like we're in the throes of a bear market on our way out. This is very much like we it's like on the cusp of a bear market. You can take a look at net highs and lows. This is super important. Why is this so important? It's because net lows has slowed a lot. Net lows was expanding tremendously over this period. And you can see just based on the distribution and the plot but that part of side you can still see that it's come down a lot. So when you see net lows slowing down like this it is a potential market flattening out starting to consolidate not accelerating to the downside heavily right now until the next piece of news comes out and as soon as the next piece of news comes out as you all know it can be whatever it's going to",

But the important thing to keep in mind here is that if I see net lows starting to expand meaningfully that tells me acceleration to the downside which is not actually the case right now contrary to what I might expect. A laptop says what's your definition of bear market standard definition 20 decline off of local highs. That's like the definition. I frame it that way because a lot of people have like an opinion on different things but that one is not really one to have an opinion on it's kind of is what it is. So now as I mentioned before let's take a quick stroll through Reddit and let's see what we can learn. This one I thought was interesting because of this question and it's something to pay attention to as a trader. So this person is essentially saying how much do I use for trading out of my net worth and then what goes into safe assets. I'm 34. Even with how fortunate and successful I've been so far in the world of trading and then also just we have been successful",

But retirement itself is still 35 years away. Hopefully you get to live another 15 20 years on top of that. So because of all that stuff I really don't think quote unquote safe assets make much sense at all. If you were to take a look in my checking account my checking account maintains a pretty insignificant amount of money on a monthly basis. What goes in there is enough to cover all of our general expenses right average expenses month over month with a little bit of a pad on top of that. I don't even have money in a savings account. I don't have money in a CD account. Everything else is utilized. It's either in brokerage accounts trading. It's in real estate. It's in other things.

And with inflation where it is now the overall propensity is for that money essentially just to get chewed away. It's not what I want. Let's take a look at this one. I'm trying to remember this one. So this person essentially is saying what is a good size for a new trader's account to be. And it's funny because the way that I think about doing this is the more money you can put into your investing account the better off you are. That doesn't mean you trade all of it especially when you're beginning. It's actually kind of funny because when you're first learning to trade the only thing that matters is your ability to put on the minimal viable product meaning a one lot of whatever it is that you're trying to trade. And if you're trading things that have unlimited risk for example stuff like that I simply would cap the risk by a wing while you're learning. So you don't actually need to have like",

But the problem is is most traders when they think like this is they're like I'm going to get a 5,000 account and then I'm just going to use the 5,000. Your ability to learn trading with a 5,000 account is there but it's not great. And it's because when you're trading with such a small account you have to make such a series of trade offs that inherently compromises what you're doing. This is why I think paper trading is so useful because if you don't paper trade and then you start trading with your 5,000, 10,000 the overwhelming probabilities you're going to light it on fire making stupid mistakes not even good mistakes to learn from just stupid mistakes that absolutely could have been avoided. So I think like the good the optimal size for a learning account really depends on your approach to trading. And if you say well Eric I don't have an approach to trading well then what are you even doing? Right if you have no approach to trading you're not at a spot to even worry about what size account it means that you need to learn an approach. And",

So if we take a look at the outlier strategy process this is all it is. We're going to figure out how something makes money. We're going to figure out what that thing behaves like and how to identify it and then we're going to figure out how we can trade it. You have to do some version of this process whether it's well defined like this or if it's something that you're just kind of cobbling together you have to do this. And again as I will continue to mention most traders they just start with this they start thinking like oh well you know what what vertical spread makes the most sense.

This one is such a common thing I literally made a video about this concept of trading options for a living because like literally just about everybody that I talk to gets it completely wrong. And that's not Eric saying that from the lens of everybody else is wrong and Eric is so smart that he has it figured out it's the opposite. I thought the same exact shit as everybody else until you start getting closer to that threshold and you're like wait a minute as I like legitimately look at this it doesn't fucking work like this. So the broader point here is let's take a look at their approach and let me know what you think if this is good or not good and why.

They're going to sell when volatility cycle is coming to an end and liquidity cycle is beginning. Take profits generated from the short calls will be used to sell puts near an effective floor of the stock based on their assessment of liquidity cycle before volatility cycle. So that's their technical analysis side of things. I'm not weighing in on that either way. That's okay. And they're saying that they don't want to get assigned on the puts. But if they do they'll add to the core position based on a price that they're comfortable with. So then they're saying that they'd obviously have to build a position that's large enough in order to make enough money off of the covered calls and cash secure puts. Beyond the million of small little things you can point out with respect to the general approach, the robustness of the approach, you have to think about what matters most. And this is the part that most people completely completely don't pay attention to. What matters most when you're trading for a living to generate income to live off of is robustness.

The reason why robustness matters is because a lot of people who have a W2 job, they act like they think like, oh, I'm like really safe and secure. I have a lot of job security and maybe you do maybe don't. But what I remind people with the W2 job is you're literally one firing away from having no income. That's really not that robust if you think about it. This is why investing whether or not you choose to be a trader or not is so important because you really do need to diversify your sources of money. Now for this person, what they're doing is grossly overweating their desire for something that's simple to do. Here's the problem with this. Think of any stock that you like and understand well. We'll literally do an example together and we'll literally click through it. It's not going to take that long. Let's take a look at NVIDIA. And let's go back three years. NVIDIA by all accounts was seen as hyper successful talk of the town. And let's say that we started messing with NVIDIA when it was around 142 on the 20, what is this? October 22. So let's go there.

Lots and lots of people are really into NVIDIA for a lot of different reasons. It's a well-positioned company and so on and so forth. Okay, all that stuff, great. So now let's take a look.

That's the very first thing we have to figure out. So do you guys want to throw numbers out so I can use at least one of your scenarios so that we can have something I guess that's at least directly applicable to you. So I'm referring to this on like a monthly basis. What kind of income comes to your mind when you think about this from a monthly basis. Income Requirement. Okay. So far it looks like nobody. So, oh perfect laptop. That's- you read my mind. This is like a very common number that I see when people talk about this. So it's literally perfect. So 10,000 a month. Now let's just first start by postulating return potential. What's a reasonable return potential that you can think of? To make this 10,000 per month, we're going to worry about that later. But I'm just thinking over the course of a year. What do you think a reasonable return would be to consistently make this amount of money? Notice how I emphasize the point of consistently.

Notice how I emphasize the point of consistently. That means that somebody coming up and saying that's what I was expecting to see 15. The probability of somebody making 15 every single year is very low. Might do a lot better, but almost certainly you're going to have years that don't exceed 15. So think of it this way. If you're a trader and your goal is to have an income generated by this, whatever this thing is that you're doing in this case trading. The way that I look at it is the more conservative, the number, the higher the probability that you will be able to hit it is 15 per year doable? Absolutely. That's a very reasonable return target. But even though it's very reasonable, what's the confidence interval that we're always able to hit that number? And you have to, that's based on the trader. It's up to you to decide for yourself. But we'll take a look at 15 something like that. And then we'll take a look at another scenario of like 6. So now we have some at least initial starting points.

And I'll show you why we're going to try to apply this methodology of using the single stock. So essentially we need to look at Nvidia. And we just need to see like, okay, how many puts in calls would we have to sell in order to make this 10,000? And that's how we're going to back into how much money we might need. So let's take a look at the call side of the equation because it looks like that's what they're talking about starting with. We'll start with 59 DTE calls. This will just be a little more advantageous to them. And let's figure out, let's look at like a 30 delta, which is a common number for the shorts. You're going to get like 5.27. And we know based on this, oops, wrong spot, 5.20. This is a 30 delta strike price is 166. So we can just assume that we're buying it at spot price. So we'll figure that out in a second.

And you're going to have to sell something around 20. So now going back to the original part of this equation, which is what they also mentioned was sell calls on a portion of the position. So that means that we would have to have more shares than this. So we already have at least a loose idea of what kind of size we're going to need. We're going to need, well, we can think about it. So we know that we need at least your 20 lot covered. And then we might say that we want at least another 5 lot available to us. That gives us 25,000 shares. Multiply by spot price. That means for this example, we need 3.582 million dollars. That's not to say that it's not doable. Let's just take a look at it. So this trade gets 358 to 500.

What I think about is literally saving up at the very least two years, preferably three plus years, so that you're literally just refilling multiple years out in case you have a slow period. laptops says in this example, aren't we assuming that we're trying to make the 10K in a single trade? Yes, that's correct. That's their premise. So their premise is they're going to sell covered calls on a position to generate income, and then they're going to manage it as such. That kind of thing.

This is why you didn't get any money this year. You didn't even make it back this year. You didn't get any money this year. You didn't get a lot of money this year. So the whole point I'm making is you are essentially slaved to whatever the performance happens to be for the index. And there are periods where the index does not perform well. So that's the first reason. The second reason is you absolutely have the ability then. You can make your specific return target. But then there's nothing that says you don't perform beyond that. I've mentioned this a bunch of times. Like my return targets have been lowered for the past two years at least, I think, where I used to target at a minimum 15 per year. And then I lowered it to eight and then even lower than eight. But the last three years, funny enough, the last two have been some of my most profitable years to date.

And if you trade via just buy and hold an index ETF or index fund, you're going to have you didn't get it, not getting it so far this year. You didn't meet mission in 2022. You didn't meet mission in 2018. You didn't meet mission in 15. You didn't meet mission in 11 nor did you meet mission in 08. And more importantly, for some of these periods, you didn't get back to break even. So for example, in 08, you didn't get back to break even until 13. And then for 22, you didn't get back to break even until 24. That's why. So it is everything to do with return path. It's a great question, but that's exactly why. And a dividend paying fund, they're not going to they're going to pace what rates were. People are way too spoiled with the rates that you see this year, last year. There is a long duration where rates were about zero. A CD account wouldn't pay you effectively. And like you couldn't even go over half a percent.

There are a lot of periods where things don't work that typically might work. But if you're trading for a living, guess what? You need to be robust because there's nobody common. There's nobody common to give you money. You have to get it yourself. So that's why in for something like this, I've found it to be way more advantageous to just continue actively trading versus just parking it in the index ETF. So you can. It's not a it's not a terrible strategy, but you suffer that problem that I just showed you. The other thing to keep in mind that is important to note is by trading, you can make money off of the assets you have parked into something versus needing to make money off of capital gains. So even on some of these years like this, where the SP 500 really didn't move that much. Even in those years, if you're actively trading even a covered strangle or the wheel or short calls against your stock position, you can still make something.

    "text": "like this, where the SP 500 really didn't move that much. Even in those years, if you're actively trading even a covered strangle or the wheel or short calls against your stock position, you can still make something. Whereas otherwise you just don't get anything or you lose money at least in terms of the value. And then the last thing to pay attention to is the way you actually make the money. Remember, people skip over all these details because they think about trading for a living from like a hypothetical perspective. But there's fucking logistics. Some of the logistics are, guess what? In order to withdraw money, you have to take money out of the account. How do I do that? Well, if I have 10 million of spy and I want to take a million dollars out, it means I have to sell a million dollars worth of spy and then withdraw that money. The cool part about trading is if you have 10 million worth of spy and you're selling options on both side of the coin, taking advantage of different market forces. And then you decide, okay, well, I just made, let's say, 500,000 from the option side of the equation, then you only need to pull out 500,000 versus another million or whatever the case is. So something to keep in mind. Too nice says, hey there, do you have any good options, books you can recommend? Yeah, definitely. Options is a strategic investment.",

Too nice says, hey there, do you have any good options, books you can recommend? Yeah, definitely. Options is a strategic investment. That's the, that's the go to that is absolutely what I would direct you towards. Chasette says this is just return target. You also have to determine the amount you're willing to risk as well. That's like a different side of the equation, but definitely, because if you're thinking about the way to generate money in any sense, you're going to have to put capital up to do something. So yeah, definitely, that's, it's a different side of the equation, but it's an equally important part of the equation, especially for people again that are trading for income or trading for a living. So if I'm, for example, trading spy and I'm just buying and holding the index ETF because that's going to be my income, well, guess what? In order to have that million dollars or 10 million worth of exposure, I have to use 10 million, whereas if I'm using options, I can sell cash secured puts that have a mobile strike and stuff like that is a little more adaptability. The more important part in my opinion with respect to trading is the ability to do other shit, I gave you guys that overview at the beginning",

The more important part in my opinion with respect to trading is the ability to do other shit, I gave you guys that overview at the beginning of this stream with respect to how the coverage stringals are performing for me and my portfolio, which is poorly. They're doing poorly because the market's doing poorly. They're long delta strategies. So the way that I'm making money is by other trading activities. It's not just being set in stone doing one thing. That's beauty of being a trader. So yeah, you have to be pretty adaptable. But when you think about the world of trading for a living, it's important to not look at it idealistically, but to look at it as it is and then figure out how to make it work because it is as beautiful as it sounds. It really is. Like the ability to trade and make a primary income source through stuff like this is incredible. It's stuff that I never even would have thought of before and it's life changing. But if you think of it in the context of how do I want this to look or what sounds cool to me, then you're really not building something that's likely to perform very well for you. So worth keeping that in mind. Sweet. All right, gang. I got a bounce. Great.",
