And that's kind of how it goes. They started monitoring the markets much more closely last week. And I don't know, I guess maybe another 15 hours, 20 hours or so. And then I should be in a pretty good spot with what I want to get caught up on. The next thing on my agenda for those wondering is going through the economic indicators that we've had over the last couple of weeks. And not just looking at the numbers, but actually pulling up the reports and seeing what's in there. And then doing that going forward for the next four weeks or so, I try to keep a general understanding of trading's funny in that way, because there are a lot of different timeframes that impact us in different ways. So you have to be aware, even if you're trading something like as a shorter term time frame, you still have to be aware of what's going on and slightly longer",

So you have to be aware, even if you're trading something like as a shorter term time frame, you still have to be aware of what's going on and slightly longer term timeframes. And as you probably can infer from that, we're also in a really busy time of year with earning season well underway. And actually it's a much welcome source of returns right now, because I was talking with somebody earlier today. And there's a good chance that this month will mark a negative year to date return on the coverage triangle strategies, which actually really, really rare. But because of that, the speculative trading has become more and more important to continue driving over all return performance, because I haven't fully rotated out of the coverage triangle I always maintained some exposure there. It's a little excessive right now, based on the fact that the market was down under the two percent today before the end of the day. But all those details integrated, it means that it requires us to do a lot of different things. And I wanna spend a little time taking a look at that with you guys.

And as Tommy rightly and very coolly mentioned here, we did cross 30,000 subscribers on YouTube, which is, as I said every time, because it becomes increasingly crazy to me that the number continues to grow. I am not optimized in any significant way for YouTube, but it tells me that there is a group of people out there that are interested in how we do things. And kind of this thing, I call the outlier mindset, not like the super niche thing. It's accessible to everybody, but it is something that you kind of have to embody today, basis. So having a community of people that are interested in that is super cool, it's something I absolutely wish I had access to, because if you look across most trading communities, it's all about people trying to figure out how much money they can make, how fast with minimal effort.

Is trading either going to be something that I'm going to willingly commit the time to? Or is it something that I'm going to maybe apply the parade or principle and just passively invest dollar cost average? It's completely viable and for a lot of people that is the right choice. Trading, as I will always remind people, is a terrible, terrible endeavor to treat as a hobby. It really is because for most people that try to treat trading as a hobby, they're making such a series of suboptimal choices. And there's, it's all tradeoffs. Everything that you choose to do as a trader is a tradeoff. So fun enough that link that's at the top, I'll actually pin it. That's to a giveaway.

I'm so curious now, one second. Yeah. It's literally like minimum wage. That's actually hilarious. So if I look across my tire trading career, the return on that time is not great.

I think there's a couple high level items that I believe are worth starting with. The main thing here is the relationship that you see with VIX. It is absolutely clustering around this 30-handle. Interestingly enough, bonds are still doing terrible. I'm surprised to see bonds down as big as they were today.

And funny enough, it's actually the first day that I sized up another increment based on market conditions. It's the psychology of a human trader is epically funny to me. Because all of the conditions based on the strategy performance were there based on what I look for. And then I was looking back over the previous trades. And I was just like, man, this is a pretty long win streak that I've had with this specific strategy. And I literally told myself, I was like, this is the exact kind of day that I innately would look to skip or to size down on. But that's",

And I literally told myself, I was like, this is the exact kind of day that I innately would look to skip or to size down on. But that's really not so much how trading works. And I knowingly put on this trade, I sized it up, following the general plan against my gut, which is saying, don't do it. And I'm glad I did it, but it was a full loss. So yeah, I guess for what the trade was, it was full loss today. Perfect. The exact thing that you want as soon as you size up the strategy. Now, joking aside, there is an important lesson I want to share here. And that lesson is sometimes following the plan for the right reasons is better than breaking away from the plan, potentially making money, which is the entirely wrong reason. There's a really delicate balance between this gut instinct element as a trader, especially if you're a discretionary trader, which almost, I mean, the overwhelming majority of retail traders are discretionary because it's very difficult to be purely algorithmic. You have to strike a healthy balance between those gut instincts, fears, senses that you have versus what you actually ultimately end up doing.

And it's something that I don't pretend to have fully fleshed out right now. It's something that I track pretty carefully, actually. And funny enough, I genuinely am starting to get to the point where on some of the deviations, I literally might start allowing a little more gut intervention, but there's a broader problem, I suspect if I do that. And the problem I suspect, if I do that, will be as I do it, the propensity for me to want to intervene will actually go up. And then right now, the slightly positive performance that I see from those gut interventions, probably would normalize to either flat or negative. Now, the thing to keep in mind is I'm not talking about deviations from a fully specific automated strategy to then deviating off of it. There's a lot of much everything that I do already has discretion, but I have discretion that's baked within boundaries. In some times, I look to violate those boundaries for one reason or another. It's just a fascinating, just processing of information. It's something that I find to be legitimately incredible with the human mind, how it processes that stuff, but also how valuable it is.

Now, it's not nuts in the context of, I mean, we're still in a declining channel, right? Like that's as clear as day. There's no ifans bots about that, like that is what it is. This is absolutely a declining channel. The way that this starts to behave around this 4963 handle down here matters quite a lot if it gets back down there. The reason why that matters so much is because this is still in a spot where it can start challenging prior highs, local highs, and reestablish at least interim uptrend. But right now, this is a resumption of the downtrend. I actually have some broad short deltas directly in the indices. And part of that is because it's a slightly better hedge for me than trying to play the movement of volatility for those that don't know. There's a lot of different ways you could play volatility. But volatility is its own thing, and it behaves very differently. So if you choose to try to hedge, let's say, for example, a broad portfolio of beta-weighted deltas with volatility you can.

The portfolio still isn't fully where I want it to be in terms of total utilization, but it's much closer. So it's about, I mean, I could do nothing now and it would be about right, but I still would like to scale a little bit more. So that is the near term game plan for the broader portfolio. Now all that aside, let's take a look at the actual move today, because I really was interested in it. You can see that there is this just massive dump right on the open. And then I mean, it just absolutely continued this trend all the way until like 11.05, ish 11.05. And then it had a pretty abnormal move outside of here.

And it's actually starting to notice more fear on top of that. The talking points you'll see for today is because of Trump challenging the independence of the Federal Reserve, right?

If you take a look at the SP 500 in terms of overall positioning, it is been. Solled off heavily, absolutely heavily for the last like two months consecutive. The broad market, I think is still continuing to unwind a lot of these positions. If you take a look at the broad changes on the day, even staples is starting to come off. The reason why staples coming off matters is because this is where a lot of people go",

The fact that the outflows accelerated this heavily in terms of across the various sectors, real estate doesn't really surprise me that people are starting to try to move a little bit of money into real estate just because it does start to become slightly more interesting here with the yields it can provide.

I haven't looked, so we'll be able to eyeball this together. Gotta get into my. Let's take a look at. All right. So I want you to look at the blue.

Tracks is essentially new sales is gone up. 2 from the start of the year and it's now up 3.8. So I think that that's that seems to be right. But sales prices are still going up. They're still going up like handedly. Wow. Price index up. So yeah, it does look like things definitely are coming up more for sale.

And this is even something that I'm doing right now with the real estate side of what I do. A lot of the properties that we have were still looking to build and expand them is best as we can. But we're not looking to take on a bunch of debt here because of the cost of the debt. It's just not worth it. So most of the stuff that we're doing is being internally financed. Now, one of the things that I do keep an eye on, it's kind of like bargain shopping is looking for distress sellers because especially in the commercial real estate world, there's a certain amount of money that you have to maintain in order to even continue business, manage payrolls. And if that kind of funding dips too low, it puts you in a really bad spot where you have to start scaling critical components that you otherwise really don't want to or shouldn't for the sake of your business.

So I think real estate right now is going to continue to show a little bit of that now of note, however, I do think that you're going to see as always real estate bifurcate. It's very regional. And I think you're going to continue to see things like office buildings, for example. Now return to office is actually been a bigger deal than I think some people expected it to be.

Now so far there's been, if you checked out my newsletter from the past week, I shared some of the recent earnings statistics and just general data for your context. And there's still a lot of overall beats, but beats become expected. It's really important to understand how earnings work. And it's worth a quick revisit as a collective. So let's look at an example here. Let's say that you have stock Apple or XYZ, whatever. We have Apple. This is of Apple. The reason why I'm using a stock like this is because it's going to be highly covered. There's going to be a lot of analysts. Let's say each one of these nodes is an analyst that covers Apple. Here's what happens. All of these different picks. The first thing to note, number one, is a lot of them directly hold Apple. The second thing to note, a lot of their clients hold Apple. This is what we would call a conflict of interest. If I'm going to try to evaluate something objectively, if I have this scenario going on, that's a conflict",

If I'm going to try to evaluate something objectively, if I have this scenario going on, that's a conflict of interest, does that mean that that conflict of interest every single time leads to some sort of fuckery now? These a lot of them will maintain a longer term position in Apple. And thus, that means they're actually highly incentivized to analyze it well. What fuckery comes afoot is let's say one of them is looking to pair down their position in Apple. What you need exit liquidity. How can you generate exit liquidity? You can have something that beats your expectations massively leads to a lot of people saying, like, oh, wow, this smash to the upside, let me go buy Apple. And as people are buying it up, one of these places can be selling it into that buying pressure. There's your exit liquidity. That kind of stuff.

And I know that all of these kinds of institutions are highly motivated to make as much money as humanly possible. And they're willing to step on other heads to do it. I know that.

Let's say Apple, if everybody does their absolute best due diligence, let's say that they think Apple's going to make a dollar for share. Well, what ends up happening is let's say that your best analysis, the absolute best analysis you can come up with, this is what you really think it's going to be as a dollar. And then all of a sudden, you put in your dollar and it comes in short for whatever reason it comes in at 95 cents. Well, what happens? We've conditioned the market now to think that this is a big giant miss in that leads to big massive down moves. Well, that doesn't look good if you're holding the stock. And if maybe you're coming up on a quarterly outpreaf, and you need to show your performance for the past quarter, if Apple's down, that's not good. So what we've done is we've built this like kitty playground where a beat is a hit.

Well, if it comes in close to this dollar, this dollar five now just sticks out like a sore thumb completely fucked it up. Everybody else, the rest of the pack stays together. So then what happens?

It's kind of business is usual. Ah, okay. We all got this. So the reason why all of this matters is because when you're analyzing earnings, when you see an actual beat, that is essentially a hit, it's what they should be doing. And it's because of the way that analysts produce their targets and it's become this generalized expectation that there's going to be a beat. So this is also why you'll see different reactions to beats and misses. The reason why is because the overall expectations for a beat, the market thinks most names are going to be. So then when you have something that misses, if we know that we graded them with kid gloves so to speak, and then there's a miss that's a massive problem. So the game of trading earnings is really interesting from a psychological perspective in terms of understanding what's going on under the hood. But then there's the fun part of this, which includes trading the actual earnings releases themselves. And again, yesterday during the pro live stream, we looked through a few of these. So I want to talk and follow up on a couple of them. So if we take a look at the names for today, there's HAL really HAL. There is RTX as well, but that didn't pass the test.",

There is RTX as well, but that didn't pass the test. HAL ended up being the primary name. So let's take a quick look. They report before the open tomorrow. But let's take a quick look at their options so that we can do a little bit of analysis together. So the first thing is coming into this. The stock price on the closest 2192. The expiration volatility is 80.47. What I'm doing is I'm calculating the event specific. The ticker ball is 51.13, 51.13, and day's expiration at this point is 4. So the event volatility for this itself is about 134.4. The expected move for that takes it to 6.77 with an event expected move of roughly 1.48. 48. This is tracking it at a 1.14. It's a little bit light, a little bit too light, by the way. So if we take a look at the options chain here, I typically run things around the 20 delta on something like this. You're still collecting over a percent. There's no reason to spread these off although it definitely can move. And we can see after hours right now, it's not really doing a whole lot. It's kind of sitting tight. So this completely viable play. This is via just",

Now in terms of how I choose to manage them tomorrow, that'll be highly dependent on what the market looks like. But overwhelming majority of instances is going to be at least waiting the first 15 minutes for that vault to bleed out. And then we'll make some decisions from there. So now the other thing that I think is worth looking at are a couple of the names for tomorrow after the close. There's a couple that looked good. Definitely not Tesla, but I want to look at Tesla. Tesla, we passed on our screen yesterday for a bunch of different reasons. But I just want to see what this is pricing in as well. So stock price 227.5, exp revol 145, 55, pickervol 94.9, DTE4, 240 and a quarter of that vault. That puts us at 12.11. The expected move. This is calculating is like 27.54.

Let's see what this shows us. So this is pricing in X, yes, see it's right now it's pricing in expected move of 9.8 with an average actual move of 10.1. So 0.3 edge to the implied vault side with everything that's going on with Tesla. To me seems like a bad trade. Now, that doesn't mean that it can't, again, it can any one of these individual names, despite all this shit that I'm saying, could always work perfectly. But you have to remember the entire scope of a trader's lens is not how does this one individual thing work out. It's always how do or how does this approach work out in the long run? There are thousands and thousands of occurrences. So it's really important as you hear me talk about this stuff. It's not so much predictive. I don't know what's going to happen.

So let's see. Yeah. So so. Lot of earnings place. Take a look at this. So if you take a look at the earnings across the board, this is a lot of, wow. Let's see. I want to get a sense of what the movement was. I'm so like dollar deltas. Look at. I want to make a filter. Try to use more narrow filter. Why? Is it because there are too many names? Let's just take a look at. And let's sort this by. So a bunch of sold puts. Wow. I mean, these are big tradesmen. These are really big trades",

And before we do that to other things, one of them. I recently launched a mini series for the Friday stream, which is outlier options trading foundations. The purpose of the Friday mini series is to try and provide what I consider to be the correct foundation bedrock to even begin learning about options or trading in general. So it's not going to be highly tactical always use this Delta always buy always sell. It's none of that stuff. It's going to be trying to help you understand how to even think about solving this problem set and how to solve it in a logical order. And the kind of things you need to do in order to solve the problem set of figuring out how to trade. A lot of traders mistakenly start running down the path of what stock should I trade, what expiration should I trade, what technical analysis indicate or should I use. And the reality is those are literally literally all the wrong questions to worry about upfront. They don't fucking matter at all at that point. Well, matters upfront is developing a rock solid foundation to be able to iterate off of because here's the next thing I literally can guarantee you.

The only way you're going to be able to identify that though and then successfully pivot is if you have a good foundation then work off of to then iterate. So it will be for the next four Fridays I'm planning four weeks. I'm actually really looking forward to this one because a lot of the outlier options trading basics and boot camps that we do is more about like the tactical what is an option and that kind of stuff which will get back to those. I do a couple of those per year, but this one is really designed to be a little more meta, but with very specific takeaways after each module that we do. So I think it'll be useful.

What goes in there is enough to cover all of our general expenses, right? Average expenses month over month with a little bit of a pat on top of that. I don't even have money in a savings account. I don't have money in a CD account. Everything else is utilized. It's either in brokerage accounts trading. It's in real estate. It's in other things.

Now that being said, the stuff that does get earmarked or living expenses and emergency expenses is in what I would consider to be less risky assets, but it's not in the context of what this is. Most people when they say safe assets, they're thinking things like zero coupon bonds or they're thinking things like CD accounts or savings accounts, stuff like that.

And with inflation where it is now, the overall propensity is for that money essentially just to get chewed away. It's not what I want. Let's take a look at this one and try to remember this one. So this person essentially is saying, what is a good size for a new trader's account to be? And it's funny because the way that I think about doing this is the more money you can put into your investing account, the better off you are. That doesn't mean you trade all of it, especially when you're beginning. It's actually kind of funny because when you're first learning to trade, the only thing that matters is your ability to put on the minimal viable product, meaning a one lot of whatever it is that you're trying to trade. And if you're trading things that have unlimited risk, for example, stuff like that, I simply would cap the risk by a wing while you're learning. So you don't actually need to have like this big account, but the problem is, is most traders when they think like this, is they're like, I'm going to get a 5,000 account and then I'm just going to use the 5,000. Your ability to learn trading with a 5,000 account is there, but it's not great. And it's because when you're trading with such a small account, you have to make such",

And it's because when you're trading with such a small account, you have to make such a series of trade-offs that inherently compromises what you're doing. This is why I think paper trading is so useful because if you don't paper trade and then you start trading with your 5,000, 10,000, the overwhelming probabilities you're going to light it on fire, making stupid mistakes. Not even good mistakes, the learn from just stupid mistakes that absolutely could have been avoided. So I think like the good, the optimal size for a learning account really depends on your approach to trading. And if you say, well, Eric, I don't have an approach to trading. Well, then what are you even doing? If you have no approach to trading, you're not at a spot to even worry about what size account it means that you need to learn an approach. And when I talk about the different ways to learn an approach, that's something like the outlier strategy process, which again, it's just a framework for thinking. It's not just or prescriptive, but it does give you something in my opinion to go off of. So if we take a look at the outlier strategy process, this is all it is.

And it's always just like, yo, that doesn't matter right now. What matters is you defining what the hell you're trying to trade, why it makes money and how it makes money.

So the broader point here is let's take a look at their approach and let me know what you think if this is good or not good and why.

They're going to sell one volatility cycle is coming to an end and liquidity cycle is beginning. Take profits generated from the short calls we use to sell puts near an effective floor of the stock based on their assessment of liquidity cycle before vaults, little cycles.

And this is the part that most people completely, completely don't pay attention to. What matters most when you're trading for a living to generate income, to live off of is robustness. The reason why robustness matters is because a lot of people who have a W2 job, they actually like they think like, oh, I'm like really safe and secure. I have a lot of job security and maybe you do, maybe you don't. But what I remind people with the W2 job is you're literally one firing away from having no income.

The reason why I'm going back here is because Nvidia just broke up of this recent consolidation, all the moving averages are ascending by all accounts of the stock looks good.

So do you guys want to throw numbers out so I can use at least one of your scenarios so that we can have something, I guess that's at least directly applicable to you? So I'm referring",

So do you guys want to throw numbers out so I can use at least one of your scenarios so that we can have something, I guess that's at least directly applicable to you? So I'm referring to this on like a monthly basis. What kind of income comes to your mind when you think about this from a monthly basis? And come requirement. Okay. So far it looks like nobody. So, oh, perfect. A lot of top. That's you read my mind. This is like a very common number that I see when people talk about this. So it's literally, it's literally perfect. So 10,000 a month. Now let's just first start by postulating return potential. What's a reasonable return potential that you can think of to make this 10,000 per month. We're going to worry about that later. But I'm just thinking over the course of a year. What do you think a reasonable return would be to consistently make this amount of money? Notice how I emphasize the point of consistently. That means that somebody coming up and saying that's what I was expecting to see 15. The probability of somebody making 15 every single year is very low. I do a lot better, but almost certainly you're going to have years that don't exceed 15. So think of it this way. If you're a trader and your goal is to have an income",

The way that I look at it is the more conservative the number, the higher the probability that you will be able to hit it is 15 per year doable, absolutely. That's a very reasonable return target. But even though it's very reasonable, what's the confidence interval that we're always able to hit that number? And you have to that's based on the trader. It's up to you to decide for yourself. That will take a look at 15. Something like that. And then we'll take a look at another scenario of like 6. So now we have some at least initial starting points. Maybe now we need to figure out what kind of principle we might need in order to pull this off. You can just do a little bit of math on these, but it doesn't matter yet and I'll show you why.

So let's take a look at the call side of the equation because it looks like that's what they're talking about starting with. We'll start with 59 DTE calls. This will just be a little more advantageous to them. And let's figure out, let's look at like a 30 delta, which is a common number for the shorts. You're going to get like 5.27. As we know, based on this, oops, wrong spot. 5.27. This is a 30 delta strike price is 166. So we can just assume that we're buying it at spot price. So we'll figure that out in a second. Let's say the perspective entry date should be 22 oct. The stock price is 14330. Exploration where looking at is 20 D's 24. And now we essentially need to say how many of these we have to sell in order to get NK. And you're going to have to sell something around 20.

And it really foregoes the most important part about when you're trying to trade as your primary income source. Which is reliability. It is your ability to consistently make the money. This is why I'm a huge advocate of lowering return targets, but trying to grow your money more so that you can more reasonably and reliably hit the target. Again, even that 15 return target, the overwhelming probability is for most traders. You're not going to really hit that every single year. Now, this goes into a slew of other things that I talk about with respect to trading for a living, which is you should never be trading the year you need in order to make the money that you need for this year.

So their premise is they're going to sell covered calls on a position to generate income, and then they're going to manage it as such. That kind of thing. Shazad says, but if the return target is low, why not just put it in an index fund or dividend yield paying fund? It's a great question. And it's for a few different reasons. Let's take a look. The first reason is if I were to put this in a low cost index fund, let's take a look. Let's go. Last 10 years will do monthly. Actually, we'll do it annually. This is why you didn't get any money this year. You didn't even make it back this year. You didn't get any money this year. You didn't get a lot of money this year. So the whole point I'm making is you are essentially slave to whatever the performance happens to be for the index.",

So the whole point I'm making is you are essentially slave to whatever the performance happens to be for the index. And there are periods where the index does not perform well. So that's the first reason. The second reason is you absolutely have the ability then you can make your specific return target. But then there's nothing that says you don't perform beyond that. I've mentioned this a bunch of times. Like my return targets have been lowered for the past two years at least I think, where I used to target at a minimum 15 per year and then I lowered it to eight and then even lower than eight. But the last three years, Funny enough, the last two have been some of my most profitable years to date. So it doesn't mean that you just hit that target and then stop. Just means that's what you have to hit in order to stay to plan. And if you trade via just buy and hold an index ETF or index fund, you're going to have you didn't get it. Not getting it so far this year. You didn't meet mission in 2022. You didn't meet mission in 2018. You didn't meet mission in 15. You didn't meet mission in 11. Nor did you meet mission in 08. And",

You didn't meet mission in 11. Nor did you meet mission in 08. And more importantly for some of these periods, you didn't get back to break even. So for example, and oh wait, you didn't get back to break even until 13. And then for 22, you didn't get back to break even until 24. That's why. So it is everything to do with return path. It's a great question, but that's exactly why. And a dividend paying fund, they're not going to, they're going to pay what rates were. People are way too spoiled with the rates that you see this year last year. There's a long duration where rates were about zero. A CD account wouldn't pay you effectively until like you could even go over half a percent. So there are significant periods where you're not going to get a yield. Again, this is the point I try to make about robustness. There are a lot of periods where things don't. Don't work that typically might work. But if you're trading for a living, guess what? You need to be robust. Because there's nobody coming. There's nobody coming to give you money. You have to get it yourself. So that's why. In for something like this, I've found it to",

First is just parking it in the XETF. So you can. It's not a it's not a terrible strategy, but you suffer that problem that I just showed you. The other thing to keep in mind that is important to know is by trading, you can make money off of the assets you have parked into something versus needing to make money off of capital gains. So even on some of these years like this, where the SP 500 really didn't move that much. Even in those years, if you're actively trading even a cover triangle or the wheel or short calls against your stock position, you can still make something. Whereas otherwise you just don't get anything or you lose money, at least in terms of the value. And then the last thing to pay attention to is the way you actually make the money. Remember, people skip overall these details because they think about trading for a living from like a hypothetical perspective. But there's fucking logistics. Some of the logistics are guess what?

The cool part about trading is if you have 10 million worth of spy, and you're selling options on both side of the coin taking advantage of different market forces.
