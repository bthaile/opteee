    "text": "I'm going to dive into my absolute favorite directional trading strategy this is the ratio diagonal whether we want to trade ratio call diagonals for upside ratio put diagonals for downside I've built this strategy over 16 years and it combines a handful of fantastic trades from options along with Trend following strategies from equities and it is probably one of my favorite strategies for smaller accounts because of the leverage provided within so we're going to walk through what it is how they work and then at the end an actual example with some best practices so that you can take all that information hopefully build your own variation of the strategy that helps you make money what's up everybody Eric K welcome back to all the outliers a shout out to the patreon family you guys make content like this possible and if what I do helps you in any way consider signing up it helps me a lot okay let's get right in why should you care about this strategy well it's pretty simple I got three things for you the first one is leverage this strategy provides leverage the second thing is it's a defined risk strategy so for newer Traders this kind of protects us even though we still need to apply careful profit and loss management which we'll get into later the fact that it opens right out of the gate to find risk is actually a good thing because sometimes newer Traders come",
