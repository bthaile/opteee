    "text": "I'm going to dive into my absolute favorite directional trading strategy. This is the ratio diagonal, whether we want to trade ratio, call diagonals for upside ratio, put diagonals for downside. I've built a strategy over 16 years and it combines a handful of fantastic traits from options along with trend following strategies from equities and it is probably one of my favorite strategies for smaller accounts because of the leverage provided within. So we're going to walk through what it is, how they work and then at the end, an actual example with some best practices so that you can take all that information and hopefully build your own variation of the strategy that helps you make money. What's up everybody? Eric here. Welcome back to all the outliers. A shout out to the Patreon family. You guys make content like this possible and if what I do helps you in any way, consider signing up. It helps me a lot. Okay, let's get right in. Why should you care about this strategy? Well, it's pretty simple. I got three things for you. The first one is leverage. This strategy provides leverage. The second thing is it's a defined risk strategy. So for newer traders, this kind of protects us. Even though we still need to apply careful profit and loss management, which we'll get into later, the fact that it opens right out of the gate to find risk is actually a good thing because sometimes newer traders",

Even though we still need to apply careful profit and loss management, which we'll get into later, the fact that it opens right out of the gate to find risk is actually a good thing because sometimes newer traders come across different strategies. They don't fully understand and then they end up putting on risk that they don't even know is there and then they get ran over. And then the last thing, because of those first two, it's a pretty efficient directional play. So what do I mean by leverage? Pretty simple. I've recently had a trade on this as the example we're going to go through at the end, but I had six long call options that were deep in the money on RTX, which is Raytheon and the equivalent equity size for that position, the notional value would have been 50,000 actually a little bit over that. And then for the options positions that I put on, it was actually under 9,000. It was like 800 or whatever. So the point being is I was controlling the same size position in this scenario, but it was a fraction of the cost. Now you might be saying that seems really good. Why wouldn't everybody do that? Because whenever you trade options, we're adding some complexity. Options have an expiration date. So you can't just buy and hold it and then eventually hope it moves in your favor.",

There's some subtleties that get baked into this that are what actually allow us to identify opportunities like this. Leverages and free. So and that's a good thing. That means that there's opportunity for us within. So let's talk about the structure. It is super simple. The first part of the trade, the first leg is a long deep in the money option, a four DTE long expiration out. I use at the very least 90 days to expiration, the majority of the time it's between 180 and 365. So somewhere between six and 12 months is my normal, but you could go in as far as 90 days. I've done that previously, specifically if you're catching a trend that's in progress. And then that's the first leg. The second leg is we're going to be short, a near DTE option. This is pretty much anything within 30 DTE. I tend to focus on stuff that's maybe, you know, two weeks, three weeks, something like that. So these are kind of the two variations that we have. We have long call plus short call. That's the bullish variation. And then long put plus short put is the bearish variation. Pretty",

So now let's take a look at some of the traits that I look for though specifically in the long leg, which is over here. Days of expiration already talk to you about the delta. This part is important. The reason why we go so far in the money is multiple vote. The first reason is it gives us the ability to move closer dollar for dollar with the underlying for those that don't remember delta, everything else, setter as purpose, everything else remaining the same delta, tells us how much the premium of an option is going to move for every one dollar move in the underlying. So if we have something with an 80 delta, that means for every one dollar move in the underlying, we're going to see 80 cents of that. Again, everything else remaining the same. The point being is by going further in the money, we move and we create essentially a stock replacement. The second thing is by going so far in the money, we actually reduce the extrinsic value of the options. I'll show you what I mean right now. Here we have RTX and let's go far out",

I'll show you what I mean right now. Here we have RTX and let's go far out in time. Let's go out to this 16th. And if we take a look at a 80 delta plus long call, somewhere one of these two, you can see that even though these are 174 days expiration, you're only paying about a dollar per contract in theta in extrinsic value. So what that means is the theta decay on these options is actually pretty small. So if you take a look at theta decay here, it's negative 0.02. So each day they burn essentially to pennies. Whereas if we do something that's further close to DTE in time, closer to us, if you take a look, the theta now for that same option essentially is now negative 0.03. So the closer we get in DTE theta is going to pick up because all options have to approximate to either in the money, whatever their intrinsic value is or zero if they're out of the money. So that's why I like the long, deep in the money option. Now there are some trade-offs here because the further out in time you go, the deeper in the money you go, the more expensive it is upfront. But the way that I look",

It doesn't just go away at the end of this whole thing. You actually are able to maintain a lot of the value that you're paying up out front. Now again, it could completely move against you and then all of that can change. But by going further in the money, further out in time, you are benefiting maximizing your leverage potential, dollar for dollar move, you don't need as big of a move to make money. And then the second thing is decreasing theta decay. Now if you notice, I do have a thing saying it can include kickers. Kickers simply put are far out of the money options. You could do it in the same expiration if you wanted to still decrease your theta decay. But essentially it's the opposite idea where we're going to pick up something that's further out in time. If I'm doing kicker options with something like this, I tend to pick something that is maybe 30 or 40 days out because the whole idea of a kicker option",

The idea is we grab something in addition to our base position that is now further out of the money and it would compound quickly. So that's the idea of a kicker option. And then for the short, it's super simple. Essentially, like I said, within 30 days, and our delta on the short needs to be above a critical strike. I'll explain what that means in a little bit. But essentially, this is how we place out. And I want to specifically show you what I mean by ratio. That's what this whole strategy is called, right? Ratio diagonals. Yes, I know that. Why ratios? Well, here's exactly why. This is a typical call diagonal. So this is further out in time. This is like 180 days out. But this is an at the money long call. And then in a shorter expiration, a short call, notice how after you go up a certain amount, there's actually upside risk. This is a problem. If I'm trading a ratio call diagonal, I am bullish.

So this is why we use a ratio. So in this case, as you can see down here, I'm simulating being long five of these style options that are deep in the money in short three. So in this case, we have unlimited upside potential. That is exactly why we use the ratio. If we add one more view to this, this is using the put side, right? So if we're long puts, we want things to go down. But again, we don't want to be wrong if we're right. What I mean by that is if we get the down move, we think it's going to happen. We don't want to be penalized if it's big. So this is exactly how we can maintain unlimited profit potential when trading these diagonals is trading them at a ratio.

So when we're talking about these directional strategies, it starts with your directional assumption, whatever that is. So you should follow whatever your process is to create a directional assumption. That's exactly what's going on here. Then when we're looking at something like sizing allocation scaling, this is pretty straightforward for me. I have a process for it where the first thing I'm going to do is look at my entire portfolio, all of the risk that's out there. I'm going to assess this opportunity that has come up and then I'm going to decide how does it fit into my portfolio and how much money does it get? So for example, in the RTX strategy, we're going to talk about in a second, that entire allocation was 10,000. That's the total amount of money that that position was allotted. Then we have what I like to call the initial outlay in scaling protocols. The initial outlay is how much of this total amount of money are you going to deploy upfront? For me, it's typically 80 or less. So if I allocate 10,000, my initial outlay will use 8,000 or less. And this gives me room",

And the trade off here is the more outlay you use upfront, the better the move is going to work. If it goes in your favor, the more it's going to hurt if it doesn't. And the less you have left over for scaling. And then for scaling, it can be really simpler or complex depending on however you conduct your directional assumptions. For me, I like to use support and resistant breakouts on a trend following approach so that I can both scale in when I'm right or as things are dropping, if I'm still strongly convicted, I will add limited scaling to the downside to average into the trade. This is a really dangerous approach. And I generally do not recommend adding any money to losing positions. It's bad practice. In some instances, I will. Most of the time you should avoid it in my opinion, because throwing good money after bad money is a horrible tendency for most traders and they just compound their losses. However, it can be a really effective approach to maximize a short-term pullback in a longer term up mover vice versa if you're bearish option selection. So",

The way it works for the long options is the further out in time you go, the more time you have to be right, the lower your theta decay, the more expensive it is. You have to figure out which of those combinations make sense for you. As far as the short option, like I said, anything within three weeks I think is fine. Typically for me, it'll be two to three. We really want to expose ourselves to the aggressive portion of the theta decay curve. That's the whole point of adding those short options. They hedge a little bit of our risk, but it's also to make some money when things don't go exactly in our favor, which is exactly what my example is about actually. Then delta. Like I said, for the long options, I prefer 80 delta plus. The further in the money you go, the more expensive it is, the less extrinsic value you're buying. So that means lower theta decay and the better you're going to move dollar for dollar with the underlying, but because it's expensive up front, you're not going to see those thousand percent",

For me, that's not my goal. Again, it's kind of what you need to pay attention to. And then for the short options, we need to pay very close attention to our ratio and our adjusted cost basis and our critical strike, which I'll get into in the example. And then the ratio, this is super simple. You buy whatever number of long options that you want. And then when you're selling the short options, you are faced again with a trade off. If you sell at a higher ratio, so let's say if in this example, we are doing, let me grab this one. So in this example, if we're long five short three, we could be long five short four. We could even be long five short five. And in this case, because the delta's are set up properly, there's no upside risk on this first trade. What's the difference? Well, the more short options you sell against the long, the more money you're going to collect up front, the more upside potential you're going to give up if you get your move.

I have a recent trade actually in Apple that I'll throw a link in the video below that I covered a lot on our YouTube live sessions that talks a lot about this exact ratio concept and how I adjusted my ratio throughout the life cycle of the trade. But that is really the long and short of it there for the short options, the more you sell upfront, the more money you're going to collect up front, the more upside you give up, and then the inverse. And then the management cycle, once we enter the trade, so we find our long options, then our short options. I like to enter the long options with a single lot first to test liquidity. Liquidity is really important because we're adding a bunch of things that actually go against looking for liquidity. We're going deep in the money, which tends to decrease liquidity. We're going far out in time also tends to decrease liquidity. So it's super important when you're trading anything like this with ratio diagonals using the long options",

So again, I'll show you an example in a second on how I set those up personally, but that's the first exit criteria. The second criteria is the short option is out of the money. Then you can choose to add more short options. The short option is in the money. So if our short call short put falls in the money, what I like to do is sell some of my long options to cover the cost of the in a money short option. This does a few things. One, it makes sure that I'm realizing profits as I'm realizing losses because if we have a short in the money option that we need to close, if you",

One, it makes sure that I'm realizing profits as I'm realizing losses because if we have a short in the money option that we need to close, if you just close this and continue the trade, there's nothing to say that the whole thing doesn't roll over and then not only do you realize a loss there, but then the rest of the position starts showing a loss. So I use this actually as criteria to help me start scaling out of the trade naturally. And then the fourth scenario that's not listed here, but is very common for me is if I enter a trade with 180 DTE, once I start getting within 90 DTE, I'm going to naturally manage it. Either it did or didn't hit my profit and lost targets and I'm just kind of trending sideways. I might reestablish roll further out, but I don't want to take those long options within 90 DTE more often than not. Let's get to the example. So this is the example trade in RTX and let me show you what that actually looks like. I entered here with the long options. I started selling short options here, here, here, and here is one I exited in total. You can see all of those movements here. I'm not going to run through it line by line with you, but",

You can see all of those movements here. I'm not going to run through it line by line with you, but I want to highlight a few high notes. The first one is this was a kind of a unique scenario for me. I typically am not super bullish here, to be honest, especially after a big drop, but because it was earning striven, short term price, mean reversion is what I was considering, and that's kind of what I was expecting to see. I didn't see it. And even though I did not see the move that I wanted, I still made money. That's why I'm using this as an example, because if you want an example of like a really profitable one, take a look at the Apple one that I threw in the notes below because that was just smooth sailing all the way through. Made a bunch of money there as a percent return on that trade because it did exactly what I wanted. This I think shows some of the power of this strategy because this was a bullish trade that I didn't get the move and I still made money. So this is again, just kind of my own version of the tracker.

There's some issues with the math in here and it's just to make this show up as it is, but overall this turned out to be about a 7 return on invested capital, even though I was completely wrong. And these are the formulas that I was referring to before. The critical strike is this formula right here, and the reason why we care about the critical strike is because as this trade evolves over time, we do not want upside risk. This is what prevents it. The adjusted long call basis is exactly what we feed into the critical strike. As you can tell, the long call basis takes a look at how much our costs were for the long options, the closed in the money short options, and then any closed long options to cover the cost of the short options that were in the money we had to cover. So this just keeps pretty close tracking of what the basis is as again, the trade evolves. And then the last one, we have the number of lots we can sell. And in this case, you can either use a risk profile super simply from the platform like this. If you were so inclined just like this, it'll tell you,",

And in this case, you can either use a risk profile super simply from the platform like this. If you were so inclined just like this, it'll tell you, you know, those kinds of things, no problem. Or you can do the math, which essentially we just take a look at our long option, our number of lots that we have out the delta, the current delta of those long options. And then we divide it by 2.1 times the short option delta. This just makes sure that we have no upside risk. So this was kind of a broad overview of the strategy. However, if you have any questions, comments, concerns, let me know in the comments below. If you found this useful, also let me know. And if you're interested, I can do a follow up video diving much further into detail on the both of these. However, we're already 20 minutes in. I know this stuff can be a little bit heavy, but these are literally the ways that I typically trade. These are some of my primary strategies. So I hope this is helpful. Be an outlier.
