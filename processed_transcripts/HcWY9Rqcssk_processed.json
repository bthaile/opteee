So we'll run a couple of these market updates in the meantime to tie this over. So what happened today? Pretty big market reversal. The market was down a pretty solid portion of the day and then towards the tail. And it started to rotate back over. So we take a look at futures here. This is just the micro Eminis. You can see that through most of last week started off down, open up today, 13th. And we opened up really soft and we were rolling down through this. And then we got bid back up. That was very curious to me. So if we grab SPX instead, which will have a little bit more follow through, you'll notice the size of the candles here is very different issues because there's more transactions going on in here in the index itself via options and whatnot. So I mean, this is still objectively a lower low, even though it didn't fall out of bed here. I don't think we're out of the woods. This still looks like the level to be beat the downside. And I think if we continue to see this downward pressure, because it wasn't a great follow through day to the upside, it barely crossed above the close from Friday. So this is still",

And it's developing a channel to the downside, right? So we've seen successive, lower highs, successive, lower lows, except for this one. But now this one adding in starts to build that out. So it's kind of anybody's guess at this point. And that's the cool part about trading is we don't really have to know. We just have to follow what it's doing and move along with it as best we can. So volatility contracted quite a lot. It opened up heavy today up over 20, the 20 handle. And it fell down below 19. Now this is typically a great spot to start considering if you trade volatility, some trades in here, you can either trade it the non-traditional way. I guess you could say in cell puts, the reason why you might sell puts into something like this is because the volatility will be very high. And then you might get out even as it contracts towards the puts slightly unscathed because of IV contracting. And then you kind of protect your wrist to the downside a little bit.

You could always do long puts, going to be really expensive. You're not going to make a whole lot on an unrelative basis, but directionally it tends to work again. Because you can see over the last six months, we don't get many runs up above 20. And when we do see runs up above 20, they're not that long in duration. Even if we go all the way back to the drop that we saw in August of last year, you can see that we were above 20 here. One, two, three, four, five, six days. And then on the seventh, he rest, and I'm just kidding, on the seventh, VIX rest that apparently in drop below 20 for a little bit. So that's a typically simple trade. It's not like you're going to make a bunch of money on it because everybody knows it, but it still is at least something to pay attention to.

And it's posting a channel, not a channel, sorry, it's posting local lows, meaning it's not falling, it's not continuing, it's starting to consolidate. So it's turning into a consolidation trend. Whereas comm services is still decelerating, it bit up slightly today, but not much. And then energy is still continuing. It's run. Energy is likely to continue to look good during this kind of market condition. Then we have financials about the same recovery, but none too strong. And it's still assuming this down trend as far as we can see now, industrials, this is consolidating and potentially starting a trend reversal, a little early to tell tech fell out of bed. Right? So even though it had an okay update, it's still gaped down, which is a pretty big move. I know because of, you know, the triple Qs. Staples lows, new lows.

This has been an easy, easy trade to continue to follow. We've talked about this for literally months now, like at least two months. We've been talking about staples. And it continues to show weakness. Real estate again, maybe slightly consolidating, but it's still too really to tell if that's local lows or if it's just an update that's likely to continue. Utilities, down day, it's not looking healthy. Healthcare is again, rallying a little bit. It's kind of the stronger, I guess you could say between energy and healthcare, but neither one of them look great. And then discretionary is still down trending. So for those that are wondering, this is defense. And defense is consolidating for some time now. So across the market, breath doesn't look super great. Now we did see that turnaround today. So it led to more names advancing than I would have expected. And we can see the change in the five day and one month, advanced, there's decliners for the total market components.

It's too early to call it heads or tails in either way, but I do think having some sort of long inverse deltas is probably not off the table. So when I say long inverse deltas, it's essentially beta weighted deltas that are negative that were long. And the reason why I say long is just because it controls risk a little bit more than being overall short options into that. So the easier way to think of it is just being short beta weighted deltas, but using some sort of long premium strategy. That is essentially what we're seeing across the market today. Now from an economics perspective, we had a few things come out that were absolutely important. So CPI came in light. It was expected at 5.3 came in at 5.22, which is not actually super great. Inflation expectations came in pretty close to expectations. And then CPI, we have to take a look at year-to-year and month-over-month. So we'll jump on that in a second.

We can see from a fed rate perspective, there's been really no change in the expectation of no change. So there's not a lot changing here. The use the word three times on a row, but there really isn't. Right? So if we look at a day ago, it was 96.8 chance of no change, not 97.3. So the market's not expecting a change in 29 March or 29 Jan. If we look in 19 March, it's still a higher probability of no change. And then if we look at 7 May, it's still highest probability of no change. And then if we go all the way out to 18 June, that's when we get a slight edge on a potential ease. So one of the things I really like to do is track this because you can see that near term changes and expectations happening real time in other levels of expectation.

So there's still again, like a lot of changing underlying expectations and what this might look like, but it's all centered around very little overall impact likely to happen here. All right. So let's take a look now at a couple of changes that we had today in the leveraged coverage triangle portfolio. So today we're going to talk about TQs and Upro. And you can see I'm still very light in both of these. We actually took some risk off today in the sense of when we were rolling some in the money short puts, we got much better strikes, which decreases the total amount of cash secured requirement for the position. So then the ends up decreasing our utilization even though the position size you'll notice will be the same to summarize what I just said. I didn't change any of the lot sizes, but because the strikes did change the overall amount of money I need to cash secure it decreased, which decreases the total utilization thus the percent utilization. This is tactical move at this point because I don't really care for what the market is sitting at right now. Again, I don't think",

This is tactical move at this point because I don't really care for what the market is sitting at right now. Again, I don't think it's end of days, anything like that, but this isn't where I want to be overexposed, which is why I'm so light on these two sub 50 and I will stay this way as long as I need to. The other thing that you'll notice it's not, sorry, it's not on this one. It's on another one that I track that will monitor the notional exposure. But remember TQs and Upro, there are essentially both three times the underlying itself. So this is essentially behaving as 300,000 of spy and then this is essentially behaving as 120 HK of TQs. So it's already levered. That's why I don't need to add too much risk here. It's one of the benefits of trading the strategy. Okay, so what changed today? Well, pretty easy stuff in TQs don't have a lot out, but I did have this position and it was expiring this coming Friday. I had the 82s, the 82 puts and these were already rolled once. So you can see I took those down. This was I think a little while ago if I'm not mistaken that I originally adjusted this role and I flattened out. This was the call",

This was I think a little while ago if I'm not mistaken that I originally adjusted this role and I flattened out. This was the call side, sorry. I had flattened out the call side and then the main adjustments came on the put side because here's what happened. I originally just took in these 83s for a small bit of profit to reposition and break out the lots to be in a couple different explorations. And this was also just taking some of the risk down. I talked about that. So then the primary adjustment today was in this trade where we were almost on to expiration. I had the 83 puts that were expiring 17 Jan. They were originally a 30 delta. I took them down. Obviously they were in the money by a bit. They're like a 70 delta. It took those in for 825. And then I offered this tranche here for 850. So I didn't change size, but I did improve my basis by three points. There's a reason why that matters. If you take a look at this down here, I just updated the information with the trade so you can see what happened. And essentially I've taken the basis adjustment down by 3.6. I've reduced the cash secured requirement for the trade by 600 bucks. Not much, but again",

I've reduced the cash secured requirement for the trade by 600 bucks. Not much, but again on something that's only 44k allocated. It's not a trivial amount of money. And really we need this to be trading. We need this option right here. To be trading at 281 before we hit our break even where we could prospectively close this trade and then move on with profit without taking it all the way to expiration. Again, this is why understanding rolling options is so important. I have a video, a link to that in the notes below that talks about it because this number matters a lot. You don't have to take this all the way to expiration and I don't intend to. Cool. So now let's take a look at you, pro. You pro was a little bit of the same. So we can see that there is actually two tranches that got adjusted today, a six lot and a three lot. And then also the short call side of things will start with a short call. It's easier. From the short call side of things, I literally just took them down. I had the 102s that were a 30 delta 21 Feb took them in for 40 cents. So that gave me 145 bucks.",

I still have 100 shares that are uncapped too early to cap those. And then on the put side, we did have to play some games. So on the put side of things, this is what came down today. I had the 90s out both for 17 Jan the 90s and the 88s. I sold them for 180, 165 respectively. And then I took them in for 564 10 respectively.

These trades are open. They can turn against me even more or seem to make even more adjustment. But what I ended up doing was taking the 90s to 86s and then the 88s to 85s. They're both in 21 Feb. They're 50 delta 46 delta. So I was actually able to put these out essentially right at the money, which is great. It's a great basis adjustment because these were both in the money at the time of adjusting. So had a really healthy move on the overall basis. So again, showing you those metrics down here on the six lot, we were able to reduce our basis by 4.4 and then we reduced total cash secured requirement by 2400 bucks. Every time this happens, we're reducing total risk, which is good. And then on the three lot, we reduced that by 3.4. Again, took down 900 of risk. So now we're just hanging out. This is where both of these sit today. Now from an analysis perspective, I'm going to conduct the analysis on the underlying self-meaning spy versus you pro just because this is the dominant index that it's based off of.

So if we take a look at drawing like a basic trendline here and then another trendline really kind of starts from here ish. But we're very clearly in a negative trend on these. This price level is really important and we'll see how it behaves if it gets a rally, if it does rally, it doesn't start approaching this. But with no rate cuts coming up and earnings coming up, unless earnings are smash out, everything looks good. This just generally looks like more room to the downside. And Q's is even worse because Q's is in a clearly defined downtrend at this point. And it has the broader, this isn't clicking for some reason. There we go. Has the broader descending channel to show it. And this is already below this support. So not only does that not bode well for Q's, but that doesn't bode well for the broader market because tech has been such a massive element, dropping things up futures are up right now.
