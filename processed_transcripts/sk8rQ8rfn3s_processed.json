So this says insider here, the reason why institutions keep loading up on GME despite all the supposed analyst warnings of the stock because they understand what's happening. The company is slowly and quietly becoming a holding company. RC is discreetly making moves while keeping the price very steady. We'll eventually explode and make many people rich. Go here isn't moass so people can sell and become rich. The goal is to share, is to get the share price so high holders don't need to sell. They can borrow against the stock as collateral.

People, like when people say this, they make it seem like you never have to sell your stock because you can borrow against it and then you just live off of what you borrow against.

Because they're going that path, but they've not really gone that full direction yet. And if they were going the direction, here's here's my argument. And this isn't my argument in terms of I don't think they're going to do it. But this is my steel manning, meaning taking another point of view to try to explore the idea. If the company GameStop wanted to become a holding company, why wouldn't they do it faster? Like that's the part that I don't understand.

I can only imagine how many charts you guys have looked at of people doing weird, funking LSD shit like this. I'm so bullish. I'm shaking. That's awesome. I love that. This says, you bullish on GameStop. I'm not here to cheerleader bet against any stock, but let's break down GameStop. Cash pile Bitcoin bet recent fundraising. Okay. Memes stock momentum. Okay. Strategic pivots. This is the big one. Like this, I think is the big one hands down is the strategic pivots. What do you guys think? Like if you were if you were to think about what like being bullish on GameStop, I imagine most people are to a degree if you're here, right? But like what do you think that like the true bulk case is? Is it the fact that they're investing in Bitcoin? Is it the fact that they're pivoting the business? Like what do you guys think? It's me says in my honest opinion GameStop will be back to the future arcade locations upgraded for current times. That's an interesting idea. That's a really interesting idea. Huh. Curious",

But I still think they're clearly is an upside case here. And when I think about it, it's a mix of things. That's why I'm curious what you guys think. Lauren says I think they're pivoting, but I have no idea where. I agree with that. And I think the way that you frame it is also correct, right? And the fact that we can see signs that the pivot is happening. We can see those signs. There's some big changes. The investment into Bitcoin is a change. The card grading part of the business is a change. And if I'm not mistaken, I think that there's a more recent piece of news. I have to catch up on GameStop that moves us further down this path. But let's take a look at what Gemini says. I'm going to do this. I'm going to ask Grock the same thing. And let's see what they say. So this is what Gemini says. This is what Grock has for us.

Gemini says, remained in headlines, significant restructuring, foray in a crypto, which is correct, continued volatility, correct, actively raising capital, and signaling a strategic shift in its treasury management, correct? Yeah. Essential theme, aggressive capital raising efforts, definitely. So I'm going to ask Gemini what it thinks of the capital raising. What do you make of the capital raising efforts? I'm actually very curious how it would analyze that. Talks about the offering, purchase a Bitcoin. Yes, this is all just standard stuff. Let's see what it says to that. And then let's see what Grock says. Grock says, the note offering, obviously Bitcoin, yes, strong earnings. It did have a really good earnings for sure. And again, when we reviewed earnings, this was the main this was the main issue is revenue because revenue is still falling. But that will happen as the company is going through shifts. So I think you have to expect that. Calm down, Jack says, I wonder if it'll hit 19 by August. If what will hit 19 the price of GameStop? I would take the over on that. And as you guys know, it's not because I'm sort of like GameStop permable. I really do my best to just objectively evaluate what I'm looking at.

Like they came through at 17 cents on their earnings where they were expected at eight. They doubled.

Colin says thoughts on leaps with this low IV. That's a really common mistake actually. And I'll show you why. So Colin, are you are you in the discord by chance? Because if so, I was going to tell you to hop in the voice chat real quick and then I can actually like talk to you. And I could discuss it with you if not the chats fine too. But the first question I would have for you, Colin is talk to me about the low IV environment. What do you mean by that? Are you using imply volatility percentile? Is your benchmark? Are you using imply volatility rank? Are you using raw IV? I want to be clear by all those metrics. You're completely correct. By the way, but there's a really common mistake people make here. And that's what I want to that's what I want to show you. Colin says not yet. That's totally cool. No problem. It's so here's a quick lesson on options because it's really important. So when we look at IV here or stock, right? So the current IV 68.74. Yeah, okay. So Colin says 52 week low. So he's using IV percentile, which is great. IVP implied volatility percentile is right now at 2 which",

So he's using IV percentile, which is great. IVP implied volatility percentile is right now at 2 which is exactly what he's saying that this is really low. For anybody in the chat that's more familiar with options, why would I say that the concept of leaps here being used when IV is low is not necessarily wrong, but it's just the incorrect attachment. I wouldn't connect those two to heavily. Like, I still would acknowledge them for sure, but I wouldn't connect those two to heavily. Why is that? Any more option savvy folks in the chat? Have an idea. Why that might be we're talking about low IV environment. And then we're talking about capitalizing on this with leaps. No guess. Let's walk you on to target as always. When I do stuff like this, I mean, this is my standard preference. I prefer not to give people direct answers because I don't think people learn as much that way. Even though it's a little slower to do it this way, I think it connects. Way more synapses in the brain to help these concepts stick in.

Not necessarily. It's a good guess. But what does this measure? Talk to me about what IV, what does IV measure? Let's look at IV, IV implied volatility. What does this measure? This measures the specific time frame. So this is a forward expectation of volatility. But not all volatility. 30 day. All. So what you're about to learn is what a volatility surface is. And you'll see why. So leaps. Daniel is exactly correct. Good job, Daniel. Daniel says how much the market is pricing in the forward expected moves for the next 30 days. It's exactly correct. Good job. So when we look at leaps, what are leaps? Leaps are long term equity anticipation. Security. This is another common thing that people fuck up. It's not L-E-A-P-S. The whole thing. It's L-E-A-P-S leaps. The entire thing is an acronym. So like you you can buy one leaps. Which sounds weird. So most of us don't do that. We would still say I bought one leap. Just weird.

I think it was Colin somewhere. Maybe I don't know. Anyways. So, oh, there we go. Colin says thoughts on leaps with this low IV. Sorry about that. So here's the issue. Leaps deal with greater than one year expiry. Long dated options. IV as measured here is a 30 day measure. What do you notice as I frame it this way? What's the problem with this in a nutshell? What do you guys see? Help me out. I'm phone in a friend. I'm phone in 37 friends to be specific. Shout out to you guys. 38 friends. Colin says specifically Jan 2027.

So what you're doing is applying Colin a sound fundamental approach, but you're just missing some of the nuance. So the vol for leaps is completely different than the 30 day vol. It's completely different. The way that the vol in leaps is behaving is completely different than the way that the vol for 30 days, what we would call the underlying vol is a different ballgame. So what this means is we wouldn't want to inherently use implied volatility percentile, which is looking at a 30 day metric to make an assumption about the vol for leaps. So here's what this means. We can make it a guess. We might make a guess that if near term vol 30 day vol is very low, we might guess that longer term vol is also low, but it's not inherently low because 30 days low. And there's no reason not to get more precise. So that's the first, that's the first part of that whole concept. And let me show you.

Front vol, let's just call everything in here like a weighted average like 30 day vol is somewhere in the mid 60s. Let's call it 64 percent. Yet if we go further out, your average is really like 77 percent. So there's a 13 point variance, I'm sorry, a 9 point variance, 13 point variance. I don't know what the fuck just happened to me there might have just had a stroke. My bad. 13 points between these. So then the question becomes, is this 77 percent actually low? Because we can't use implied volatility percentile, it's a different vol. So there's a few ways to do this. You can either use historic pricing and come up with your own metric. I think if I'm not mistaken actually, let's see really quick. I don't know if this has long term vol. Let's see. Oh, it does. This is great. So what we can do is take, so this is literally beautiful. So let's go back to the 20th of June.

And let's go back to the 20th of June, just that curiosity. That got completely blown out because of the zero DTE. I don't know if there's a way to turn that off. I'm trying to make this easier to see. There we go. This is fine. So this is, let's go back like a month. There's a 28 June. We'll go back a couple months. It's perfect. So if we go back to 28 June, what do you notice? If we go back to 28 June, long term vol about the same. So then if we go back further, again, this is 28 April. I think that's as far back as it let's, let's let's go. So let's go to 28 May and see what long term vol looks like. But notice the difference in front vol. How much front vol moved? Now let's take a look at how much back and vol moves the difference between May and now. What do you notice? All of this movement that you see in vol is happening in the front. So again, using even this expiration, that's 233 days of expiration. From 28 May, vol was 74. I'm trying to see if I can click the other wine here. Let me get rid of these.",

I'm trying to see if I can click the other wine here. Let me get rid of these. Oh cool. So for the current expiration, vol there is 75. If we add the other, it's still 75. So what I'm showing you here is that there is essentially no change happening with long term vol. So if you bought leaps with an expectation that you would make money as vol increased, what you would end up seeing is the vol and game stop here. Let's say if vol goes up from 68 to 100, you'd be saying, damn, that's a big move in vol. I should be up a bunch of money. And then when you take a look at your leaps, you're going to be like, fuck, I didn't see any of it. What happened? This is what happened. You're playing a completely different duration vol than what you're looking at in the other example. Let me know if you have any questions on that. Lauren says, in the front, do you mean short term?

The issue is if you executed that idea as you had designed, you probably would be like, what the fuck happened? Because it wouldn't be in at least based on what I could see here.

It was just about the front. Okay, cool. Yeah, we Gucci then. Sweet. So now let's talk a little bit about one other factor with respect to like more volatile names like GameStop with respect to how volatility behaves. Because in that trade idea that you had that you shared with us, you wouldn't actually be isolating volatility very well. And it's because if you're using leaps of some sort, so let's say that you were trying to gain exposure to a longer term idea or you're using leap calls, whatever the case is, you're using some sort of longer term option. Now the issue that you're going to face with that is almost all of the volatility in GameStop is going to occur in the front. And the other thing is if you do if you do start to get hold on, if you do start to get those moves, your long term option, specifically a long call is really going to be based on direction.

Kind of it. It's just going to be a directional play because you'll still have the delta of the position. Delta doesn't go away. Delta is Delta. We learned this actually on the stream yesterday that regardless of how far out in time you go, delta itself is delta. So what that means is if you get a 50 delta that expires in a day or a 50 delta that expires in 500 days, it's still 50 delta. Now the movement of delta itself will be different based on gamma, but delta itself is delta, no matter what. GP says, so you don't benefit too much from low 30 day IV if you buy 90 days more out. That's exactly correct. So what this is saying, and it's not inherently 90 days, 60 days, 100 days, it depends on how that longer term vol is. So in this context, if we take a look at 90 days, we can see 90 days is actually moving more. So if I were to just ballpark this, I don't know why it doesn't let me use all points on the line.

So in the 60 day time frame, there's still a move in the different terms. And then in the 90 day time frame, there's still a move. It's just less.

But if you take a look at the variance here, it's a completely different scale because the variance here is from 113 down to 55. And if you go to 90 days, this is 113 down to 70. So a 15 point gap between 30 day and 90 day front wall. And then if we go to 365, you'll notice that it's actually kind of right in the middle of the range. So this is at 76, whereas six months ago is at 93. So actually quite tight and funny enough, the vol in those leaps based on your the original concept we were talking about with Colin, this actually looks like the the vol Michael lower. So that would be the ultimate irony with this kind of idea is that placing this trade based on 30 day vol, 30 day vol definitely looks like it might revert up, but this looks like it might go down. So that I I'm chuckling about that because options can be so fucking tricky where the idea that Colin had was good. Like that's a it's a good idea. But",

So that I I'm chuckling about that because options can be so fucking tricky where the idea that Colin had was good. Like that's a it's a good idea. But it's a really good expression of how without a pretty good understanding of options, how even a good idea can lead to losing money. It's that nuanced. Gary says got a couple leaps only because I'm expecting price to go up to 60. Yeah. And that's a completely different thing is the funny thing is depending on when the leaps were bought, they might have been bought very expensive relative to what it was recently. But if you take a look, this is another thing when we talk about something like Vega. Vega is an option sensitivity to changes involved. So even though the gross changes here aren't as much, these options are way more sensitive to these changes. It's like a scale. Does that make sense? What I just said, if not, let me know. What I'm talking about there is Vega. So when you go further out in time, these will have higher Vega, greater Vega, which is premium change per 1 change, involve. So the Vega is going to be greater for longer term options. Vega here is lower. So when you see a larger Vega range here, and this might have a smaller Vega range, Vega",

So when you see a larger Vega range here, and this might have a smaller Vega range, Vega can still impact the premium of this option more. And it's because the Vega on these longer term options is so much higher. So let's look at an example together. If we look at the Vega for 15 Jan 27, I'm just going to look at the calls. Vega here is 0.105 for 566 days expiration for these leaps, 1.105. And then if we take a look at 20 days for the at the money, Vega is 0.022. So Vega is about 5 times higher for these. So what that tells you is that even though the total range is smaller in terms of changes in the user's involvement, it will have bigger impacts when they do happen out here. So to make that example complete, actually I'll use Google Sheet real quick. I think it'll be easier. We'll find a spot right here. So we just said this is for the at the money we have two different Vegas. So let's say under like let's say that we have two explorations, two different terms.

And then let's say that we have IV and input change in IV. Vega. And then we'll have premium change. And this is the assumption that we're going to use a similar delta. So I'm going to move this off to the side really fast so we can solve for this. So let's do like 50 delta. The 49 delta is the 40s way out here. And the Vega for these is 0.117. This is the 566 day. So 0.117. And then the vol for I'm just going to use the expiration is 79.84. 79.84 and then for 20 days going to that 50 delta or the closest to 50 delta that we can find which are these 24s or Vegas 0.022. IV for the expiration itself 66.13. So now what we can do is we can simulate different changes in vol to figure out how these two relate to one another. So let's say that we get a 10 point change in front vol and a 2 point change in back vol. So if we want to calculate what the change in premium is here we would simply take the total change that we're getting. Multiply that by our Vega. Multiply that by 100. This is 401 lot.

That means even on a small change you can absolutely find that you get a bigger change in your premium as a result of Vega than a much larger move in the front. So Vega and really term structure this is this is what term structure is. It's really, really, really important to understand term structure and option is trading. I'm actually probably going to clip this section to make a standalone video on it because I think that especially using something like GameStop is such a great example for this and it'll be a good reference I think for people. Lauren says wait waiting Vega isn't always higher further out right. It generally is. It's not always but it generally is. The reason why I say not always is because it depends on what we are normalizing off of. So here's what I mean by that. If we pick a strike.

The only instance where you might find some nuance to this is if you have an option that is very little extrinsic value. So that can skew things if there is some sort of expected event but those get into like very rare environments. In general if you normalize off of Delta or if you normalize off of strike you're going to find a higher Vega the further out you go essentially always. But there are there are nuances.

Likely the guess for tomorrow right I can base it off of what's happening today I can reason my way and it will probably be closer than what I'm guessing further out in time. So what I'm showing you is that as time expands as we're trying to forecast moves over longer durations we expect greater variance. Okay now if we think about where this variance impacts in terms of an option it impacts the option in the extrinsic value. So if an option has more time it is a larger portion of its value that can be impacted by this expected variance. So this is why you see options that are further out in time have higher Vega in more sensitivity to their term implied volatility. I'm emphasizing that comment of term volatility. It's not the",

It's not the IV that most of us when we say IV most of us were talking about the underlying IV which is 30 days. ZXBorg says intuitively seems like leaps there's more time for volatility to affect actual price calling it Vega is just a way of measuring the effect. More time for volatility to affect. Yeah I think that that's a really good intuitive way to think of it ZXBorg I like that. Yeah. GPs says my understanding is leaps are still a good buy at low 30 30 IV because of Vega. This is incorrect for literally what we just discussed. The reason why the way you're framing that is incorrect is because again to give you this example if we take a look at how much 30 day VAL has changed compared to 365 day VAL right which is the furthest out this has. If I go back and I take a look at the total change in the last two days VAL 30 day VAL went from 76 essentially 76 10 to 76 and then further out in time went from 56 to 55.2 so a bigger change here day over day yet if we go further back",
