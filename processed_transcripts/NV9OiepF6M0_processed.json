    "text": "I made 84 return in NEM in less than 40 days. So this video is going to walk you through a ratio call diagonal position that I put on in NEM. And I want to walk you through essentially how I've managed the trade. It's been a while since I've done one of these trade deep dives. So this one's not going to be edited. We're just going to get straight into details and start working through the position. So here's in a nutshell, what played out on the 4th of March. The old birthday to myself, I guess I gave myself a gift. I saw NEM starting to break out in a pretty big way. And it popped up on one of my alerts. And this is where I entered the trade. Now what's the origin of all of this? It's kind of simple. And I've been talking about this stuff on my YouTube lives actually for quite a while. And it's the rotation that we're seeing still from capital tied up in things like if I zoom this out a little bit more like six months, you can see that on a longer term time frame, IT communication services, these have been killing it for the last year plus. And definitely within the last six months. But if you take a look at some of these shorter term time frames, like if we go here two, three months, you notice that. That energy materials, industrials starting to creep",

But if you take a look at some of these shorter term time frames, like if we go here two, three months, you notice that. That energy materials, industrials starting to creep up towards the top a little bit. We go into one month. You'll also see that we still see energy running at the top materials still down towards the bottom. But it's important to click within materials because metals and mining has been doing a great job for some time. So you can see metals and mining is actually at 15 as compared to some of the other sub sectors of materials that are struggling. So because I've started catching some of this rotation of capital into these other products, especially against the broader inflationary environment that we're in, I became really interested. So NEM popped up on one of my scans and I decided to essentially just watch it. And I didn't like it here at all. So what I ended up doing was setting an alert right here at 3131. And it's just because this is kind of where I saw near term resistance if we started to get some sort of pullback. And we started to see a little bit of life come through. It's hard to see because it's kind of suppressed, but you can actually see that volume on these updates started to expand. So",

And I ended up getting the alert after it cracked above 3131 on the 29th. So then I was watching it on the first of March. I was keeping an eye on the volume as we're running into this. And then actually when the dividend was coming out, you know, you'd never know necessarily against broader market conditions. I didn't necessarily, you know, integrate too much into the decision cycle, but I was aware that there was a dividend coming up. And then on the fourth, I started seeing this really strong volume. So I entered into a pretty speculative. So this lived within my speculative allocation of the portfolio, but I entered into a ratio call diagonal. So the broader market hypothesis, kind of what we've been talking about, high inflation now, especially higher for longer is becoming a theme. Tech is still doing well, but starting to fall off a little bit. We're coming into an earning cycle.

There are, you know, a handful of things coming to the forefront of my brain, but the main thing that I want to highlight here is the rotation of capital into things like metals, into things like energy. Actually, I have a couple energy trades on as well. Now the primary profit mechanism in here was a bullish thesis, meaning I wanted NEM to go up. My original targets when I entered the trade were 42 and 31, 42 simply because that is where the near term high was. And I would love to see us run up there. I didn't think that we would run straight up there, but that was the near term target. And then 31 because I was actually setting a really tight stop to the downside on this. And it's because it's in a broader downtrend. I viewed this as a really speculative entry. I typically don't like to enter things when they're running down like this. I look for strength, but because I saw strength in the broader subsector, it made me interested on this volume breakout. So once I saw it crack up above this kind of, you know, 32 handle, that's when I really thought we were seeing some strength. So the original trade that I put out was a 45 lot of the 30 calls expiring 21 June 24. And this was back on the 4th",

So this originally was allocated to be a 25,000 position in its entirety. And I wanted to use most of the capital upfront because I had such a tight stop loss on the product. The reason why I went with a ratio called Agnoles because I wanted to leverage to the upside. I also typically prefer the efficiency is compared to buying the shares, although either in this case is fine. And I went out to 21 June at the time of entry because that falls into kind of my standardized days to expiration target timeframe for ratio called Agnoles. I like the longs to be definitely longer than 60 DTE typically 90 plus. I've used to be over a year for almost all of them, but I've actually slowly have brought it in quite a bit. And normally it'll be somewhere around 90 now with any am specifically liquidity was a concern. So I had to find decent offerings that led me to an entry that wasn't overwhelmed by super wide bit ask spreads. And that's actually why I ended up at this.

It was like a 70 something delta typically prefer 80 plus, but again liquidity kind of drove me in that direction. Now when I first sold calls against the position that's actually this line item here, you notice that I only sold 10. Why did I only sell 10? Well, it's because I wanted to see more follow through and I started to see it, but then it kind of just started trading sideways for a while. And actually during a couple conversations with the pro community, I was talking about unwinding this position for a small profit because it hadn't yet done what I wanted. And it was getting a little bit long in the trade because I originally wanted to manage this position before we came into earnings on 25 April. Now I was okay to hold through earnings if we had a sustained move and it looks like we still are having a pretty decent move, but it's not quite enough. And I also have some travel coming up. So that leads into a little bit of the decision to unwind, but going back to the choice on the ratio. And that's why it was",

So that leads into a little bit of the decision to unwind, but going back to the choice on the ratio. And that's why it was so light because I was sacrificing the money upfront because I really wanted to try to maximize my upside potential in the position. And I collected 60 cents on that. So 600 bucks and those were 32 delta. And obviously over the lifecycle of this trade, they actually fell in the money. So if we go to 20 March here, you'll see that's where the position was managed. And that is right here. And essentially what I wanted to do was roll out and up to give me some more upside potential to see if I could get the calls a little bit out of the money, but keep the ratio. I didn't want to add any size because I wanted the upside profit potential. So that's what I ended up doing. I was able to take the 34s to 35s. I had them out to 19 April. And I collected 88 cents. So a small credit on those of 20 cents, same size. And obviously those fell deep in the money. These came off today, the 11th of April for 435.

So fortunately, sometimes when you get these really big, powerful moves, the short calls as you would expect, they really decrease our return profile. Now what ended up happening in the position, I started with like I said, it's around like a 78 allocation. I was targeting around 75. And then I saw this next breakout. So I had another alert set for anything above this 35 22 handle. And we saw it on the 28th of March. We saw a slight uptick in volume, not quite as much as we saw earlier, but still enough that it registered for me. So in this case, I chose to add a little bit to the position. And that's what you see down here. So I added five of this of the same exact contract for 6.32. So that took my aggregate basis to 455 total investment at this point is 22,735.

And the reason why it's a little bit of a mistake is because based on the amount of time I had left in this trade against my original premise, if I were to scale in here again, I probably would have gone with the rest of the allocation because it was a no risk trade at that point. What I did was slide the stop up from 3170 and change. And all I did was bring it just below this really aggressive consolidation period that we had here. So it went to like 34 and change, which would have locked in a profit. And then I slid it up again to 3526 actually on this day, the very next day. And from there, I just start using the moving averages to follow the trend. So my game plan because of the constraint for timing, I was going to use this expression, this moving average as my exit, which is just a nine or a 10 day 10 day. So that led me to today where we fell off a bit. I see the candle today. It still looked pretty strong, really light volume though. I didn't love that. So as I saw the day unfolding, I ended",

And the probability of this channeling sideways for a little bit before it regained some steam is moderate in my opinion. And this realizes a pretty decent amount of profit right out of the gate. So what I ended up doing was offloading all 50 of the 30 calls. And again, I bought them for an average of 455. And I ended up selling them for 910 average today. So that takes the realized PNL on the long calls to 22,765 less the 3550 from the short calls. So that takes the total PNL of the trade to 19,000 to 15, which is an 84.5 return on invested capital. So a couple notes that I want to highlight here specifically is I still think this rotation is likely in play. However, it might slow down a little bit with the current rate environment dragging out as it is. And it wouldn't surprise me to see capital starting to rotate back into tech, which is something that I'm keeping an eye on. However, we're at a really interesting market",

I think that you'll see things like this start to move even more still. But this was a way essentially for me to gain exposure to gold because this is one of the largest gold miners. And it came up on a couple of my alerts. So that was the trade. I have a few others that I've actually talked to the community about in different products. But this one I thought was interesting because of two things. One, the mistake I made here and two, because this is something that it was actually coming up on my time horizon to manage this trade because it wasn't performing. And I got a decent move. It was running a small profit, but it wasn't moving enough in order for it to make sense. But I gave it just enough time that it started to pop out for me, which is again, ideally what we wanted to see here. So that's the trade.
