The goal for the video today is to do a little bit of a look ahead on the market, what's coming up and just what the market looks like it's setting up as for the week, how I'm thinking about it at least. And then I want to walk you through four of my recent trades just to give you an idea of some of the things that I'm looking at, why I'm looking at them and how I'm fitting them into the portfolio. So that's the agenda. I do want to start with this, what you see in front of you here. For those that are familiar with the channel, you know that I have a stats background and I really enjoy conducting data analysis. It sounds kind of weird to say that out loud. It makes me sad for myself to a degree, but I genuinely do find this stuff interesting. I actually couldn't tell you why. And what I took a look at here is analyzing the average weekly return in spy for the past 15 years. When I compared it versus a short and I labeled it long, but that's a standard trading week. So short is essentially if there's at least one day closed of the market. So this week Monday closed, if it's Monday, Tuesday closed, that would still fall into short. And then",

And a couple things jumped out of me here. The first thing is I actually thought both of these would be a little bit larger in terms of severity. And this highlighted a really interesting change in paradigm that I'm not used to seeing. And it's because if you think about it in the last 15 years, rather than that 15 year period, essentially being kicked off by a bear market 2007, 2008, 2009 kind of like that timeframe, that then just turned into a progressive nonstop bull market. It's actually a different snapshot shot. Now when we look at this stuff and it's pretty cool because we've had two bear markets. We've had one in 2020 when we saw that COVID crash. And even though that was a quick bear market that ended up being a positive year, it still was a bear market for like three days. And then the second was in 2022 when the market was down like 19.4. That was a really interesting year. So that starts to change a little bit of the data that we'll pick up. And it's actually kind of cool",

So as we go through that COVID crash, this does have an impact. And with two bear markets in those time frames, we know markets tend to crash down and then take the stairs up elevator downstairs up is the common saying. So this will impact data sets like this. I highlight this for you because even if you don't choose to do this kind of data, it doesn't, you know, tickling or fancy like it does for me. When you're receiving this information, you should have that context because a lot of people do really terrible data analysis in my opinion where we're trying to essentially look for what we want to find, not what's there. And it can really skew our perception. So anyways, that's the first observation that both of these were smaller in terms of severity than I thought.

It's kind of like a standard error bar. It's almost like a candle, right? It's almost like high low. It just shows you standard deviation, how much deviation from this average is there based on the period that we look at. And we can see that standard trading weeks definitely have longer tails to the downside and slightly shorter tails to the upside. And we can also see that short trading weeks again, where at least one day is closed, if not more during the trading week, that we have a pretty significant multiple higher, again, still very small. We're into three decimal points for this to even become relevant. So technically speaking from a statistical perspective, I would actually call this kind of thing insignificant. It's just based on the scale. It looks bigger than it is. What? What's on my wife? But when I look at this, it's, I find it interesting because obviously I can see artifacts of positive drift. I can see that being amplified slightly during short trading weeks. And for those that enjoy trading things like volatility and whatnot, this is actually quite interesting because trading volatility over long weekends is quite lucrative.

And that's actually not one of the trades I'm going to talk about today, but something to be aware of for my options trading people. All right. Well, that aside, let's take a look at the market. What's going on here? So we still have this very interesting series of patterns. And I'm specifically talking about the top three that you see here. So Spy, QQQ, IWM. The reason why these are interesting is if we take a look at even these standard deviation channels, they're completely different slopes for the same time frame. The slope that you see for IWM is much steeper than what you see in Spy, although both are positive sloping and QQs is actually negative sloping. This does not look good for tech in my opinion. Now what this turns into, I also have no idea. But one of the things that really surprised me is when we had Nvidia report earnings, it was an insanely solid earnings, but it wasn't perfect by the market standards or expectations I should say. And Nvidia sold off a bit. So some of that could be short term price extremes based on again, these different perceptions that will take a little while to price in.

But I have to be honest, as I look at this, I am surprised to see tech trailing down like this. I really am. Now, hopefully this is just a consolidation period. I say hopefully because I want to trade tech, it can be so explosive to the upside. And I'm also trying to rotate out of a T-Triple Q's position that I have that looks good, but I still have to wait like two more weeks for these short calls to make up their mind where either I can take them down out of profit or not, but they've been under water for a while under water meaning that the trades profitable, but the short calls have been in the money and now they're like right at the money. So I'm waiting for that. So this actually bodes well for that trade specifically, but I would much rather trade tech to the upside because I've been using leveraged products, whether it's T-Triple Q's or again, my intent is to rotate into futures at this point because I think these kind of like big severe moves seem to be slowing down in this case.

But from a trading perspective, I would want it to be moving in my direction. And in this case, it is clearly not doing that. It's just kind of, you know, trend and sideways here, which is fine, but something to keep an eye on. Now this move in the Russell has been interesting because we can see that it's sort of starting to catch up with where spy is, but it's still trailing. So if we take a look at this, the term highs on the three month chart inspire 565 against 563. We are essentially back at highs in the spy, not so in IWM, but we're not that far off. So the term high here is 228 and we're at 220. So still not in insignificant gap off of that high, but we're moving closer into this general area of congestion before we hit that peak.

They haven't looked good for a few weeks now, which is again, you can't trade off of this directly because on different time frames, it can still look good. So actually zero DTEs have been running pretty healthy. So remember, this is looking at 30 day vol. Now that's one observation. Spy starting to consolidate second observation. I think that it's likely for us to continue trending sideways here until we see some sort of next news event, whatever that looks like, whether that's the Fed reaffirming more this rate cut, although I am starting to believe most of this initial cut is going to be priced in already. And I think that's part of the reason why we saw IWM start to rally. But at this point, I think we need a new catalyst, whatever that is, but status quo will be not really held for very long because as you'll see in a little bit, we have some events coming up this week. QQQ, this just looks honestly, like I said, ugly to me, all of these moving averages are getting super, super congested. Price is kind of rotating through some of the shorter term moving averages, consolidating on the longer. It's below the three month point of control, which I don't",

Price is kind of rotating through some of the shorter term moving averages, consolidating on the longer. It's below the three month point of control, which I don't love. And if we look on a six month, we still have a giant gap. So longer time frames, this still looks really good, but on a shorter term time frame, it doesn't quite look as appealing to me. So this to me is kind of in a holding pattern. This is something I would trade either still slightly, directionally bullish, but expect to manage the downside quickly or trade it sideways. And then I'm waiting for a breakout. So as soon as we start seeing stuff cracking above 484, starts to look interesting to me, 478 would be the first threshold we got to get above, which is the point of control than near term highs here so that we can continue this progression because there is a positive. The positive is although we have not hit a higher high, we have hit a higher low so far. So that still is a general consolidation pattern as far as I'm concerned. Right? So we can see that higher, higher is here. We're not there yet, but you don't always have to run right up to this higher high. It's common. So if you look at this, we have this",

So if you look at this, we have this higher high relative to the time frame before, then we have a low higher high, a low higher. This is a lower high than here that then came down and then rallied back up. So this in and of itself doesn't necessarily bowed bearish in my opinion, but it bodes watch versus super bearish or bullish either really. I need to see what it does. And then small caps, I still feel bullish and I'm surprised that they're lagging as they are, but they are. I see net highs lows in the New York Stock Exchange still looks really, really solid. So yeah, this one I can't help but find slightly curious that it's moving the way it is. I would expect this to be driving a little bit more. Now let's take a quick look across the sectors and take a look at this. We see XLB crushing it. We see XLF crushing it. We see XLI crushing it. XLP is doing well, starting to consolidate, but still doing well. Same thing for XLRE, starting to consolidate, but hanging right at highs.

Same thing for XLRE, starting to consolidate, but hanging right at highs. XLU, XLV, what I find fascinating here is for so long, for so long, when we look at technology, that was propping up the SP 500. Now we have the negative momentum in the SM in tech being negated by all of these other sectors that are actually driving this performance within the SP 500. So there's internal divergence. We're not seeing participation across all the sectors across the board, which is again fairly normal, but it means that I would be a little selective with where I'm putting my money as I am right now. So I have long exposure in SP futures, but I don't have it right now in small caps. And even though I like that trade and I don't have it right now in the queues, although again, I'm waiting because I want to establish there, but I want to unwind this T-Trop Accus position first. So that's a quick look across the different sectors. Like I said, during the live stream later today, we'll go through some scans and see what kind of interesting trades and stuff like that we can find.

Now the other thing I want to run through is what we have coming up for the week ahead. So I'm just going to update this to be this week. And then we'll see what's on the docket. So again, we're starting with some important metrics that really pertain to inflation. Manufacturing prices, PMI, global manufacturing PMI, these as per usual will be interpreted in the lens of inflation and impact of inflation. So this is something I keep an eye on because if there's some big news that breaks from these, it has an overwhelming probability of moving the market. Then as I look across the fourth, big things I see here, job openings. And then I like the beige book just to read through it, but it's not anything that I think is going to be ultra market moving as of right now. Now the two thing I do want to highlight though is the job openings here and non-farm employment change and jobless claims. I think these actually are going to be really, really emphasized this coming week because of the revision we recently saw. So the market I think is very interested in these metrics and to see like how they're moving after the previous revision. So two of those are on the fifth",

So it also is coming from ISM in addition to SP. Then on the sixth, we have unemployment rate, same thing kind of what I was referencing before, non-farm payroll. So again, just this employment stuff I think will be interpreted in the lens of the recent revision. And that looks mostly it. So if we take a look out of curiosity, how the market feels about that this week, let's take a peek. We'll grab SPX and let's take a look at the volatility that we're seeing across this week. So I'll open this one up. The reason why I open this one up is because it helps me just clearly see where the vols are. So we can see Tuesday a little bit higher, Wednesday lower, Thursday lower and then Friday is a bit of a peek.

This is one way I like to look at that, which is just super fast. The other way you can look at this exact things. If you look at the implied volatility here, I would want the out of the monies. I would kill all these other series and I would just look at this week. I can see the same exact thing as I do up above, but it's just a little bit of a quicker, quicker view in my opinion. But this is another way you can look at that. So yeah, that's what the market's looking like. Now, I wanted to talk to you about a few trades that I have on and had on. So one of them actually is in NEM. And this is on the 27th of aug. I opened in 18 oct 50 put for 1.16 per lot.

So typically what I'm quoting these trades, unless I'm doing like a specific trade review where I'll go through the sizing and the methodology there for these, I'm just quoting in one lot, but none of them are. Now for NEM, the reason for the short put was when I saw the market kind of rallying up here, it looked like it was starting to consolidate. So I put it on in this period here and I just had a really tight stop. Now this is a little bit of a two-pronged trade because you'll actually notice that VAL is relatively low. But even though VAL is low, risk premiums are not. Risk premiums look pretty good here. They're converging a little bit, but you can see when I put the trade on, risk premiums actually were quite healthy. So this is a little bit of a put-scu style trade and it's also gaining me exposure to the energy sector, which right now has been performing a little bit better than some of the other sectors. So that's the idea behind this one. And it's, I think they're trading for like 80 cents or something like that right now. So I'll give it a little bit longer, but I'm essentially just",

And it's, I think they're trading for like 80 cents or something like that right now. So I'll give it a little bit longer, but I'm essentially just slowly moving my stop up. This was my original soft stop. Now this is my soft stop. And I just kind of ratchet it up slowly, slowly, slowly. And we'll see, but this is just benefiting from the passage of time. This fits into the portfolio for a million different reasons. It's giving me positive theta. I'm not expecting necessarily rock star movement from this at this point. It's already had a massive, massive run. I've traded this before. You can see these other little highlights that I have from previous positions that I've put on in here. So this is just kind of going back to the well. But I'm establishing a slightly different position in here just to fit the portfolio well. So that's pretty much it there. Now the other trade I wanted to talk about is ASTS because this is an example where I did actually sell a put spread. And the reason why I sold a put spread is because rather than worrying about stopping out on the trade or setting some sort of stop for something like this that has pretty high movement, right? So if we look at the 5-day movement average five",

So if we look at the 5-day movement average five days is 12. And if we look at the 28, 17. So the probability of getting stopped out in something like this is really high for the way that I would trade. So here essentially, I was able to put on a 20 September 29, 28 put credit spread for 40 cents. So it's a dollar wide. And the reason why I stuck with the dollar wide versus widening them out is because of the edge I was able to derive from this because for a dollar wide credit spread neutral based on standard 30 delta short putt would be 33 cents is what I would need for like a for a neutrally expectant put credit spread. So here is able to get 40 cents. And when I modeled the 2 wide, the 5 wide, it didn't have the same edge that these did at the time that I put the trade on under 27th. So just let this baby ride. These are under water right now. So you can see that I put them on here. And they still would be a profit if we hang out here, but if we continue lower, then that would be no good",

And they still would be a profit if we hang out here, but if we continue lower, then that would be no good for them. But don't really care because again, these are spreads. So I just leave them, set them forget it, they'll either work or they don't work. That's all there is to it. The other one I want to talk about is GIS. And this is just because this thing has been popping up on a million of my scanners. It's showing a ton of strength. So here on the 27th, I ended up selling the 20 September 70 puts for 98 cents. So that's right in here. And same thing you can see these I don't even have a stop on because it essentially has been popping up on my alerts. But as I look at that trade and where we are now, I essentially would look at something below this level as my soft stop. So kind of when I would first want to hear about it. And then these again, just another way you'll notice most of these are selling strategies. It's because the portfolio needed a bunch of these to offset some of the other positions and overall theta. And then the last one here is already up and down. So this trade is down. But",

You can see the same levels I've had on. I've traded this for variances premiums now essentially for three months. I've been trading them. So these have been just really, really, really solid. And here I had short strangles and 20 SAP. It was the nine and the six. And yeah, I mean, they're paying really healthy premiums, even though the implied volatility percentile is low. Still this is another example again, where the variances premiums are super solid. So you can see how I've been trading it all in here. And Vol has just been trending pretty consistently right above what we're seeing for implied. So just a few things that I've been doing. These are all speculative allocation of the portfolio, smaller trades. And then the core allocation is still kind of in what I was reviewing earlier. So yeah, again, I don't talk too much about what I'm doing all the time just because I don't necessarily think it's really pertinent to people because what I do is what I do. But I also know that sometimes people will reach out and ask me like, what I'm doing, how I'm looking at the market. So",
