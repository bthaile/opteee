    "text": "this video is going to walk you through how you can build your own long box spread tracker this spreadsheet will help you understand what the annualized return of the trade you're looking at is it will help you track your previous trades and it even has a tool built in that lets us see the current yield curve so that you can pick where you want to buy your box spreads meaning loan the market some money so what's up everybody Eric here shout out to the patreon family and specifically for you guys a copy of the spreadsheet will be available in the patreon shop so if you are silver or above you get it for free otherwise there's a free option you can follow along with me and build it for yourself to walk you through how to make for yourself and then most importantly I want to make sure though we have a rudimentary understanding so long box spreads is when we are buying them that means our cash and sweep is going to decrease by debit and then the profit at the end of the trade at expiration is going to be the width of the spreads so let's take a look at what that looks like if we take a look at this box spread in SPX we want to balance a couple things I typically try to go wider apart so that I don't have to put on so many but you go",
