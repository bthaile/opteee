    "text": "hey everyone eric here starting up a really fun segment i think i'm calling it small stacks and essentially what i'm going to do is take a segment of my portfolio and trade it as if i would a smaller account so i decided to take 5k and the reason why i picked that number is i think that that's like pretty much the absolute minimum you should consider trading options with so with that part in mind i want to jump over to the main screen and kind of talk through what this is going to look like so it will be a margin account although i do not expect to use margin frequently the goal is not what most people typically attribute i stand firmly in my belief that small accounts essentially you know below 20 25k their primary goal shouldn't necessarily be to turn into a bunch of money and the reason why i say that is because small accounts have a lot of shortcomings that they have to work around i.e the ability to manage risk is a big one so the goals i have for this account is exactly what i would for any small account which is make sure that we're preserving capital and we're learning obviously i don't really need to do either of these so in my for my personal goal i'm gonna try to pace the market in in the account and the reason why that goes a little bit different",
