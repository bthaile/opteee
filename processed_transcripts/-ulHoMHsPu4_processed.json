    "text": "If you have a small options account or trading account, please watch this. I'm doing you a super big favor. You have to throw out what you think you're trying to do and you have to realize that early on your superpower with a small account is saving money. It's not trading your super small account into a ton of money and let me show you why. If we have a 5,000 account and a 500,000 account for comparison, I'm giving you four different scenarios where we're saving 100, 200, 500, 1000 doesn't matter what time frame it could be monthly weekly. This is just one instance though. With a 500 account, if you save 100, you just grew your account by 2. Then 200 get you to 4, 500 bucks gives you 10 growth, 1,000 gives you 20 growth. If you do that on a 500,000 account, it's 0.02. You're 0.04. You're 0.10.02. What am I showing you? This doesn't last forever. Thankfully, what this means is in the beginning, you're saving's rate provides such insane growth of your account. It's not funny and it's a guaranteed return. This is a guaranteed 20 return. This slows down as your account gets bigger and bigger. The same contributions matter less and less. You go from a 20 add to 0.2. Now, there's a big difference between returns as well. The funny thing is is what would consider it to be a really good return 20 30 somewhere in here, especially",

The funny thing is is what would consider it to be a really good return 20 30 somewhere in here, especially if it's consistent over time. On a small account, it doesn't matter. It doesn't move the needle. If you get a 20 return on a 5,000 account, you're getting a 1,000 box. It's not bad, but it's over the course of a year. Nobody's really going to look at this, especially when you can save this over maybe a couple months if you're doing a good job with your savings rate. However, there's 20 on a 500,000 account. Now, it gives you 100 grant. The funny thing is, is most new traders are so focused on trying to jack up this return, that they blow their accounts. They're not spending the time focusing on building the skill set to achieve a consistent return while aggressively saving, which is way more prone to lead you to where you want to be if you give it some time. Be an outlier, see you guys later.",
