That's why it's topical So Lauren back to you. I noticed you didn't respond yet Why did you do it again? So you reiterated sell to clothes? Why is that? There's a specific reason I can tell you exactly why and it's not because you're dumb you're not It's not because you're not paying attention because I know you are It is something to do with the way that you automatically are framing these things in your mind and it's super common What you're doing is thinking of the trade or your treat you're thinking of the transactions from your standard perspective and your standard perspective is buying options because I assume you don't",

So nice job Lauren All right next one What is the most common method to settle an option super easy? We went over this There's a statistic from oh, I see I'm actually pretty sure I shared it Um Yeah, this is just straight forward question What's the most common method to settle an option?

Let's see if we can find something that's I like the trophy Is there oh Goaded love that one So travel or so gets plus one fake internet point congratulations and The answer is the majority are closed The reason why that's super important is because most of the people on Reddit in theta gang would lead you to believe that most options expire worthless And they use that as a rationale for selling options most of them expire worthless You sell the options most of them expire worthless That is logical the problem is is it's wrong. It's just not true That's an issue. So the reason why I'm emphasizing quiz question number two is because this is tied to a really common mental approach and validation for Way methodology for trading that's just purely an accuracy is wrong So most options do not expire worthless so that does not bolster the position of selling options as some sort of secret edge that somehow everybody knows about But it's still a massive edge so last question here what are the two big biggest differences between buying and selling Options there's more than two technically, but there's two massive differences",

That's exactly correct the the most important differential between buying and selling options Unequivocally is not the fact that there's credits and debits that is a big difference to be clear that you know I already said that it's There's multiple differences, but the biggest ones by far Have everything to do with",

Simple Because if I'm dealing with An option that's tied to an underlying that's worth five dollars It's going to have a completely different series of values than an option that's 500 let's take a look at this for a practical example together You're going to notice I'm going to do a lot of these where I'm going to take us into an options chain together So that you can see with me So let's start with Cisco.

I imagine you probably know the answer But what's more expensive the two-day insurance or the one year insurance and I'm not talking on a relative basis I'm talking as at a gross dollar amount You Recess on it one year pretty simple why because it's a longer contract that's exactly why So Days to expiration is important because the length of the contract will impact the price associated with it The current risk-free rate The reason why the current risk-free rate isn't input to models is because It tells us What price we need to have integrated into the pricing model where a participant could go get that risk-free rate somewhere else So there needs to be a reason for us to trade an options contract which has additional risk If you don't integrate the risk-free rate and let's say that the pricing is completely off where you could get the risk-free rate Somewhere else for free and then an option happened to be cheaper on a relative basis Who wouldn't go for the risk-free rate? I would it's risk-free So the risk-free rate is a really important input into the model The next one is any dividend yield to the underlying The reason why yield is so important is because it impacts the stock price movement volatility It impacts the propensity for early assignment risk So the yield really is important from two different perspectives a call Has early",

It looks kind of funny Pretend this is an options contract now And if this was mispriced for whatever reason We actually don't want to trade it up to 500,000 anymore Because we actually think it's worth 100k This is the mispricing as far as we're concerned So what we want to do is isolate this difference through hedging activities To capture that differential That's all So the pricing of an option being priced correctly doesn't mean that you can't make money And it being reflective of priced correctly or incorrectly There are just different profit mechanisms Completely different profit mechanism So that's the that's the lesson there Let me pop the door for Thor real quick",

They're completely different things So the way to think about the pricing of options is that they offer specific elements that can enhance things they offer a different profit mechanism But as I mentioned in the beginning You don't have access to that profit mechanism. It's just the reality of it Okay, let me get back to the questions We can spend literally as much time on this section the rest of these are going to be super fast And this is the the heart and soul of this session so feel free to throw literally anything you have At the the questions that's exactly what we should be talking about right now because this is the important element Okay Recess so making money comes from the risk assumed because it've gone another way Doesn't mean it was mispriced.

Why is this the case? There's a distinct reason So the implied volatility in GameStop is much higher But the implied volatility percentile and rank both are much lower Why is that the case? What does that tell you Uh, Rointiti says did you see my question? I did not feel free to dump it back in and we can circle back on it Rointiti says market cap that's not it. That's an okay guess Reese says gme is usually higher implied volatility Compared to meta. I think is what you meant And oh, I see you're talking about the same.

Yeah, same same So what Reese is saying is correct What he's saying is that generally speaking GameStop has higher volatility than what it has right now Even though the volatility in GameStop is already double what it is in meta So that tells you that GameStop is more volatile of an underlying Think of this is another way of viewing beta If we view beta of the s and p 500 it's typically 1.0 If you look at things that move around more you'll have beta of 1.3 1.5 2.3 you can have beta that's in excess of it This is a similar way of looking at that Um Rointiti says do option premiums have more volatility buyers and sellers at half in whole dollars like stocks do I think you're mixing a bunch of things here So if we look at The number of buyers and sellers which we would refer to as liquidity then absolutely I actually talk about that quite a lot So if we look at So if we look at The number of buyers and sellers which we would refer to as liquidity then absolutely I actually talk about that quite a lot Where if we look at the open interest and if we look at the volume For half strikes compared to whole",

I'm stoked. It feels like you guys are Feels like you guys are crushing this So let's talk this one's easy.

They will have narrower bid ask spreads Bid ask spreads are super important Because they represent your ability to get into and out of something at a fair rate And we did a focus topic a while ago on how to calculate liquidity bid ask spreads And before you ask you already know I have a video on it So I will share this video that goes in depth on assessing option liquidity bid ask spreads all of those kinds of things but the The main takeaway is for you to know That there are two prices that you will see You typically can transact in between these prices These prices are typically set by market makers One of the games for market makers is they obviously have to make markets There's certain requirements For their quote book being turned on or the quote machine being turned on",

I don't remember where but I remember seeing this before So let's talk about that one really quick because it's super easy so The way to think about consolidations is that consolidations are Just a form of price action. That's it now. I can tell that you're You're incorrectly assigning consolidation to break out There's a relationship between them, but it's not an inherent relationship a breakout is a very specific Uh profit mechanism that has very specific signals that has very specific behaviors Underline conditions. There is a relationship between consolidations and breakouts But it's not consolidations and breakouts automatically are tied together. There's more to the equation than that Let's talk about consolidation consolidation and really anything else related to Actually sorry one sec.

It's when an underlying is bouncing between a range And generally it will be flat Now the caveat is it's highly highly relative To the time frame you're looking at So if we switch this to a five-minute daily This is a consolidation on a five-minute time frame this much smaller range right here And then this is a breakdown out of the consolidation And then this is a rally back up into another consolidation Which is a consolidating in between this level So on and so forth So the way to think about consolidation is just sideways trending price action It tends",
