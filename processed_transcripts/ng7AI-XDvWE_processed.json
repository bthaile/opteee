And normally it's like, if blank can do blank, then you can learn options. And we just got back at it today. So that's actually two big wins for Eric because I had two great popular culture references for today so far. For those that don't know, I don't know shit about pop culture. That's why it's topical. So Lauren, back to you, I noticed you didn't respond yet. Why did you do it again? So you reiterated, sell to close. Why is that? There's a specific reason I can tell you exactly why. And it's not because you're dumb, you're not. It's not because you're not paying attention because I know you are. It is something to do with the way that you automatically are framing these things in your mind. And it's super common. What you're doing is thinking of the trade or your you're thinking of the transactions from your standard perspective. And your standard perspective is buying options because I assume you don't sell options very much based on that response. Exactly. So Lauren says",

That's exactly correct. Good. Nothing serious to take away from that. But the exercise that I just did there with her is something you all should be able to do with yourself, which is positive attribution. It's actually getting to the root of why something is happening and being aware of it. That's how we can make adjustments going forward is through awareness. So nice job, Lauren. All right. Next one. What is the most common method to settle an option? Super easy. We went over this. There's a statistic from OIC. I'm actually pretty sure I shared it. Yeah. This is just straightforward question. What's the most common method to settle an option? And it's not what you hear a lot of. Close. That's correct. Travel or so is correct.

The reason why that's super important is because most of the people on Reddit in theta gang would lead you to believe that most options expire worthless. And they use that as a rationale for selling options. Most of them expire worthless. You sell the options. Most of them expire worthless. That is logical. The problem is is it's wrong. It's just not true. That's an issue. So the reason why I'm emphasizing quiz question number two is because this is tied to a really common mental approach and validation for way methodology for trading that's just purely inaccurate. It's just wrong. So most options do not expire worthless. So that does not bolster the position of selling options as some sort of secret edge that somehow everybody knows about. But it's still a massive edge. So last question here. What are the two big biggest differences between buying and selling options? There's more than two technically, but there's two massive differences. The most important ones as far as I'm concerned. So let's see if you guys can",

It's something we talk about a lot. One, we're building trades. Premium call capital. It says premium. That's not it. Why not says credit debit. That's not it either. It's think of the implications of that. Travelers will say debit and credit again. That's okay. Here we go. Okay. Reese has part of it. There you go. Elizabeth has the full answer. So at Elizabeth, you get plus one fake internet point. And since somebody made fun of my goat, which is a little it's saddening to me because I really like the goat. I'm a let this is a point for Elizabeth, but it's also a slight to be clear against Lauren, which is stopped at bullshit, respect the goat. So Elizabeth gets plus one fake internet point. That's exactly correct. The most important differential between buying and selling options. Unequivocally is not the fact that there's credits and debits. That is a big difference to be clear. That you know, I already said that it's there's multiple differences, but the biggest ones by far have everything to do with this risk reward graph. This is the zero line. So if we buy a call,",

Take a quick pause before we actually get kicked off with the material and see from you all in the chat right now. If there are any other specific questions that you have, the way that this question list works is by the end of the session, you should have an answer to whatever the question is that you have. That's why I'm tracking them here. This is why they're literally for everybody to see. So at the end of the session, you will literally be able to answer everything that we input over here. If there's anything else that you want to add, if there's anything related to option pricing that you want to get an answer on, now's the time to bring it up. If not, and these questions are good, we can continue on. All right. Great. So let's get started. We are going to grab our handy dandy notebook and no unlike the dude from Blues Clues.

This should be components of an options premium. And the way that I typically would write this as inputs to. And the reason why I differentiate that way just for your context is the details of an options contract are the standard things that we quote when we're talking about an option, right? We talk about what the underlying symbol is, what the days expiration are, what the strike price is premium, the type, whether it's a caller put that kind of thing.

Because if I'm dealing with an option that's tied to an underlying that's worth 5, it's going to have a completely different series of values than an option that's 500. Let's take a look at this for a practical example together. You're going to notice I'm going to do a lot of these where I'm going to take us into an options chain together so that you can see with me. So let's start with Cisco. This is great because this is a 60 stock. It's cheap. Let's go to 28 days to expiration. Let's go to the at the monies. The 50 delta right now, which is 62 and a half. Let's see what these are worth. 1.73 by 1.90. You don't have to know what that stuff means just yet. That's just the price for this 62 and a half call. That's 28 days to expiration. Let's go to meta. I'm pretty sure meta is pretty expensive now in it. Yeah. Meta six six forty seven. Let's take a look at the at the money. The six 50s. The six 50 call in the same expiration cycle is 2985 and 3010.

The six 50 call in the same expiration cycle is 2985 and 3010. What do you notice? Way more expensive. So the first input that's relevant to us is the underlying itself and it's because the underlying itself will have different values that are important to us. The next one is the type of option that we're looking at. Is it a call or is it a put? The reason why that matters is because the pricing relative to both of those is going to be slightly different which will explain later. We also care if it is a US or American style option or European style option. The reason why this matters is because early exercise applies here does not apply here. That impacts our pricing models early exercise is a risk. So this one doesn't have a risk that this one does. That's why that matters. The strike price which all of you are familiar with but when we pop open an option chain that's literally just the price that the contract is tied to.

Just work with the example. I know it doesn't work like that but work with the example here. Do you think that the insurance that you would pay for two days is more expensive or less expensive than insurance that would last a year? Kind of straightforward. I imagine you probably know the answer but what's more expensive? The two-day insurance or the one-year insurance and I'm not talking on a relative basis. I'm talking as at a gross dollar amount. Rises on it one year. Pretty simple. Why? Because it's a longer contract. That's exactly why. So, days to expiration is important because the length of the contract will impact the price associated",

So, days to expiration is important because the length of the contract will impact the price associated with it. The current risk-free rate. The reason why the current risk-free rate isn't input to models is because it tells us what price we need to have integrated into the pricing model where a participant could go get that risk-free rate somewhere else. So, there needs to be a reason for us to trade an options contract which has additional risk. If you don't integrate the risk-free rate and let's say that the pricing is completely off where you could get the risk-free rate somewhere else for free and then an option happened to be cheaper on a relative basis. Who wouldn't go for the risk-free rate? I would. It's risk-free. So, the risk-free rate is a really important input into the model. The next one is any dividend yield to the underlying. The reason why yield is so important is because it impacts the stock price movement, volatility. It impacts the propensity for early assignment risk. So, the yield really is important from two different perspectives. A call has early assignment risk. If you're short of call, a short put doesn't have early assignment risk from a sales side perspective. However, the short put has the risk on",

If you're short of call, a short put doesn't have early assignment risk from a sales side perspective. However, the short put has the risk on the market dropping after the dividend. So, both calls and puts are impacted by the dividend yield. And then there's the last one that is in gold. Volatility. The reason why volatility is in gold is because when we look at a pricing model, all of these things are known. Every single one of these details are known. Definitively, it's not I'm taking a guess. I know them definitively. I can look at the underlying and see what the price is. The price for meta right now is 647-49. I can see the price right now. The type of option I can see if I'm talking about calls or puts. I can see it right now. If we look at the type of contract that it is US American versus European, you can see those pretty simply by looking up the contracts. The strike price we already talked about. You can see that right in the middle there. There's your strike price. I can see all of these things right now. Days to expiration. That's the length of the contract.

So we do not know the implied volatility element of a pricing model. This very, very important point as we go through the rest of the session together. So I will take a pause there. Where's my other little sheet? My little croissant input to an options premium. Do you feel comfortable with the inputs to an option price based on what we just talked about? Those are the inputs to an option price. I'm just updating our timestamps. And 54 is good. Capital Apes says the standard deviation play a factor. That's what implied volatility is tracking the standard deviation. It's looking for deviation of future price. Reese says, so how do we arrive at input? I'm sorry, at implied volatility, which is a great question. We're going to talk about that more in a minute. So good so far, it seems. Okay, cool. Don't worry, Reese.

We will get we will touch on that when we get into the pricing model input specifically. So to pivot now over to premium premium, fortunately, is really, really simple premium is broken down into two buckets. So let's do a little bit of drawing together. We got to, you know, sometimes you like, you just got to draw, you just got to express yourself. The funniest thing about all this drawing is I really actually hate drawing. I don't like it at all. So this is always entertaining to me. But let's talk about the premium of an option, which is Spanish for the price. There are two elements that equal to premium. There's X-Trenzic and Intrenzic. Intrenzic is simply the strikes relationship to price. X-Trenzic is made of volatility, implied volatility, time. So one of the notes here is that, there you go, you can see the fly volatility there. One of the notes here is that implied volatility lives within time. There are two different things you can isolate them. But the more time we have, the more time implied volatility has to be volatility. So implied volatility doesn't exist without time. So what that means is if time is zero, what does that mean?

The reason why you need time for volatility is because we're talking about implied volatility. It's forward looking. If you are at time zero at expiration, there is no more forward looking. The contract is now expired. It's all historic at this point. None of that is forward looking. The contract is gone. So that's why implied volatility lives within time. As soon as time is zero, implied volatility is gone for that contract. Needs time. Now the relationship between strike and stock is relative to whether or not we're talking about a call or put. So let's take a quick look at these. I actually think it might be in this. Yeah, here.

The reason why money matters is because it impacts the probability of the option being in the money, which impacts the overall value of that option. Options that are expected to have intrinsic value are worth more than options without intrinsic value. So super important point. Okay.

So I actually have a video that talks about volatility in detail. So I am going to share that video with you here. Right there. So volatility. We don't need to add it here. Volatility is the only input that we're missing. So that video goes through volatility in depth. The way that we price an option effectively is through pricing volatility. There are a lot of different kinds of volatility. And if you'll notice back on this, we literally have an entire session about volatility by itself. That's how important it is as an input to this entire thing that we do as option traders. One of the things you are doing, whether you realize it or not, every single time you are trading an option, is you are expressing an opinion on volatility, whether you mean to or not, you are. So you have to understand that because it changes the way that we frame and make decisions on position sizes, types of positions, the way we structure our trades, which we'll get into in a future session.

But it rarely is anything worth the effort of trying to maintain a forecast model that actually would have enough edge priced into it to be able to just isolate vol like that and then compete on this space because the mispriceings that we're talking about now are dramatized just to make it easier to understand.

    "text": "The mispriceings that they might be looking for on the market, it's not even out to two decimal points. It could be out to six decimal points and they would put the trade on at such scale and they can also more directly isolate volatility through hedging activities because they have lower transaction costs that they can actually isolate this thing and put it on scale to take advantage of much, much smaller price discrepancies that we just don't have access to. So all of these different pricing models that you see floating around binomial trees, black sholes, merton, these are theoretical pricing models. They're designed to help us understand options and they're used as simplifying functions in no way are these the way that options are actually being priced in the context of volatility. Because once we price volatility, we can use something like black sholes, merton because we can adjust for some of the simplifying assumptions it makes with respect to the stock distribution and we can use log normal. We can change those small inputs to make it pretty accurate but pretty fast. The thing about getting really accurate with stuff like this is that these kinds of pricing models are close enough provided that the implied volatility calculation is very accurate. So to use more advanced pricing models typically introduces latency. Pricing models use simplifying functions so that they're one consumable but two so that not consumable to be clear for you and I they don't",

It's so that when they're programming them they're fast and this is typically good enough. So the way to think about pricing is far as a retail trader. Options are priced by institutions. They're priced by institutions that are playing these games that I'm outlining for you here. The pricing that we participate in is whether or not we think the current price is fine for whatever we're trading but to answer our first question from this is how do you quickly identify mispriced options you fucking don't as a retail trader you absolutely do not you have no fucking idea and it's because this game is happening at a level that you don't even see. So the game of identifying mispriced options it's not for you. There's going to be other entities that are much smarter faster well equipped to do that actual thing you will not know if it's priced correctly or not because think of what this represents if you are able to identify a mispriced option as a retail trader that means every other active market participant missed it and didn't do anything about it.

So this one is super simple you don't quickly identify nor do you typically identify it much at all you just take an opinion on what volatility might be or what you think volatility might be but to go as far as calling something mispriced way off. The other thing to keep in mind is that there's a really important relationship between puts and calls called put call parity if put call parley parity is violated in any way there are high frequency trading algorithms that are hunting for that exact scenario and the reason why they're hunting for that scenario is because there's an arbitrage opportunity or there's different kind of positions that can be put on to even have a risk-free trade potentially. So there's an arbitrage opportunity. So that's again going to happen so fast you you literally won't even see it. So there are structures that maintain the relationship between puts and calls from an efficient market perspective and then when it comes to the pricing of options we as retail traders we simply go through and we accept whatever the market is pricing the balls at.

So then the question is where do you get your volatility from? We as retail traders we derive it from the market we take that's why it's called implied vol were implying it from the market but the input that's actually used in pricing models is called forecast ball that's when we decide what volatility should be and what we're going to price volatility act.

Oh I ordered Mel she really likes salt so I ordered Mel a bunch of there's this drink brand called element ELM and tears some shit like that and they just do like hydration stuff like liquid IV and whatnot but there's stuff like super it tastes like drinking fucking salt water I have no idea how she could possibly like if at any way she was just talking to me about that scenario one we have a house we have two windows and then scenario two we also have a house this one also has two windows pretend that these are the same and that",
