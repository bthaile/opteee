    "text": "all right everybody Eric here with part two of my favorite strategy which is the cash secured strangle I already introduced it in a previous video talked about kind of how I like to set it up when I look for those kinds of things now what I want to jump into next is how do we manage the trade so let's jump over to the main screen here and work through it first and foremost if you recall we kind of did a little bit of a management tree on how the trade works out so let's do that again real quick just to recap first I'm gonna sell to open a put of some sort and then one of two things is going to happen the put is either going to remain out of the money in which case I'll close for a profit and then sell another put and continue to do this circle here now the other scenario is we can end up in the money if we end up in the money there again is a branch of two possibilities the first one is we can roll the trade and based on how we choose to roll the trade it'll either end up out of the money or it'll end up in the money which we will continue this process here we can roll for some time I've rolled for over a year before so you can roll for some time or you can choose",
