There's actually a follow-up session from what we kicked off last week, which was diving into Roryn Kitty's old trades. So the goal for today is to finish going through some of his old trades. And then I think we should talk a little bit about kind of what we see going on with GameStop today, because there's quite a few interesting things I think that it's worth going in depth on. And I've gotten a handful of people that have sent me some posts from like Super Stalking Stuff that we want to take a look at. So I am looking forward to digging in with you all. For those that don't know, on the last live stream, I decided to start dropping in where people in the live stream are from. And take a look at the last one we did. This is essentially what we had. So we had people from quite literally all over. I think we were missing Africa is a continent. And then I think we need a little bit of like northeastern over here. But I mean, other than that, we have just about everything covered. The Aussies, you know, I'm friends with the Aussies. I spent some time in the military hanging around them. I still talk with them.

One of the things that I find so fascinating about the GameStop story is that it's this thing that really has taken people from all different kinds of backgrounds and brings them together. Like how literally how fun is that? For me, it's an absolute blast. Because as a lot of you know, I'm a professional trader. It's what I do. And the way that I look at the whole GameStop thing is probably a lot different than the way that a lot of other people look at it. But it's still the fact that the same circumstance brings people from literally all over the place into one spot. It kind of reminds me of the melting pot that is trading or the melting pot that is the military. That's really what comes to mind. The military is really, really good at pulling people together.

But I fully intend to pick up where we left off. And I've gotten a few questions in the meantime. So one of them is about the 5K share purchase history. We left off at the June 2020 Yolo update. So that's where we're going to go. We like essentially are through a good bit of his previous trades to see what they looked like and the delta between the positions and stuff. So I'm excited to keep moving this forward. Get back into June. Here we go. So this is where we left off. So geez. So a couple of things really stuck out to me from where what we did last time.

And again, I always feel the need to remind people that from my lens, I'm not trying to deconstruct what Warren Kitty is doing so that I can try to copy him. That's literally not it at all personally. The reason why I like looking at his stuff is because the movements he's made as an investor in trader are naturally fascinating to me. And it's because from a trading perspective, a lot of what he does would not follow a standard fully logical pattern. Not saying he's illogical, but when we're talking about trading investing, the standard logic is make as much money as you can decrease risk. Like those are really the point of this. But every once in a while, you'll come across anomalies that have different objectives. One of my friends, he's a YouTuber. And I talked to him a lot about his preferences as a trader.

If we look at the standard motivating factor, make more money, reduce risk, ideally at the same time. If you can make a bunch of money with low risk, that is generally the pinnacle. But then you can come across somebody like the cat who literally, literally flips all of that all over the fucking place. It's crazy.

I can't help but notice that whenever we do these live streams, we really, we seem to hover around that magical number for just a hot minute. It takes a 69. It takes a crowd to make it happen. So let's start with. Dr. Stase says, if you ever do merge, it should be T-shirts that say fascinating and anomaly. That's hilarious. That would be probably the worst merge launch ever, but it would be typically funny. But yeah, I really do find just about everything pertaining to this just absolutely curious.

So February 2020, 44,400, something like that, February 2020, 215,000. Big difference. Then we go from April to May, back down, sub 150. Then we go from May to June, back down again, another 25k to 121. What I'm highlighting is from a normal traders perspective that is insane volatility. And the way that we would typically move around those kinds of positions is very different than this, which is why it's so damn interesting. So the other things that I want to highlight from the last session is that we absolutely found that he is completely confident averaging down as something is declining if he still believes in it, which clearly he did, he continued to cost average, cost dollar average into the position, which is interesting. Now what I noticed with that though is that he would do it with longer term options plays, longer term. I've not seen him do",

I've not seen him do that with some of these shorter term options plays, which I don't know if he does or doesn't. I literally haven't looked past this since we discussed it last Saturday. So now we go back in and pick up where we left off. The goal here was obviously to do a quick recap for anybody that might not have missed it or just once the TLDR. That's essentially it. We have some very clear behaviors and tendencies that we can identify for roaring kitty. So, Cetric says, if I would buy a huge amount of contract, yellow closed to the money on heavily shorted stock, would the same thing not happen? You have to remind me what we're talking about for that. Yeah, I'm not sure. You have to, Cetric, let me know what that means. Cetric says, if you yellow 50K on a heavily shorted stock with options, could anybody have launched it like that now? Because it wasn't just because it was shorted, 50K in options is nowhere near enough. And the other thing is like, he didn't launch, like he doesn't have enough money at this point to cause anything.

That's one of the craziest things about this is, and this is one of the things I didn't know about him is he's using leverage via options. The very first trades that we have of his, which is going to take me second, but it's worth showing again, you just have to scroll all the way down here. Oh, yeah, somebody gave me a cheat code on the last one. You guys have to tell me what the last, damn it. Somebody gave me like the specific hot key to get to the bottom instead of having to do this like a freaking caveman, but we're here. So if we go all the way back five years ago, you can see that literally his entire series of positions are options. That's literally how he started doing this, which again, I did not know that. Based on everything I heard, I had the impression that he was a stock trader that sometimes used options to amplify the position, but I didn't take it that he was an options trader, which is what I would classify this as he's absolutely a stock value investor at this point five years ago.

So we still have these base positions that are in 2021. And we can see the value of these positions. The reason why this matters is because he's still playing two things I can clearly identify. He's playing options that are further out in time. And he's still playing options that are out of the money. Very important note that these are out of the money options that he's playing that far out in time. That's a very specific kind of options trade to take, especially in a longer term time frame, which we can talk about that really quick so that you understand why I'm highlighting that to you. So I don't know if on demand let's just go back far enough. Does this let us go back to 20. Let's see, can we get back to 21? We can. Great. And we go back to 20. This is perfect.

Don't worry about these weird bars and stuff. It's just because it's on demand being stupid. So let you just let this load for a second. Well, I'm literally going to recreate his portfolio like so that we can see exactly what it looked like, which was one of my goals on the last session, but we just couldn't go back far enough. Again, don't pay attention at all to this candle. It's misleading you. It's just because it's on demand and it's broken data. So just take it for what it's worth. But what we can do is get rid of all of these other positions. This was I think an example we were doing at some other point. So we'll just clear out the whole portfolio. And then let's scoop up his exact position. So the first thing we have is 500, 500 shares, 500. And we got those five Hyundai. His basis was five, six, five, six, five, one, six, six, three, five. Just being super precise. I'm going to get rid of all these other we were doing. We've done a million examples. That's why you see all these other simulated trades in here. Okay. So that's his basis here. And we also have a bunch of options trades. So we have let's go to",

So he's buying tiny little delta's. This is nuts. This is absolutely like mind boggling to me. And he got them for six cents. Mind boggling. This I'm not even going to lie. This reminds me of like amateur options trader movements. And I'm not saying that he is. He obviously isn't like he's probably even more skilled than I am.

The last two series that we're going to pull in here. Take a look. 17 July. What do you notice about all of the expiration choices he's selected? What do you pick up? There's one very clear thing I see so far. And again, this is the beginning of the fingerprinting. I don't know what happens next.

I really don't agree with you. The reason why I don't agree with you is because he's been trading GameStop for a long time now. And now he's just starting to purchase shares. And the shares are a trivial amount of the portfolio. He grabbed 500 shares at 516. If we go back through this archive of all of his positions, he's trading options. So I actually don't interpret it that way at all. I view it as he's just trading GameStop to the upside. I don't think he's looking at this as I want this asset. And I'm going to use the shares to use options to get me to the asset. He had the money to buy 500 shares when he first opened his account. It was worth about the same. So I don't actually see that here at all. Okay, so what this tells me, the fact that this is he bought 300 of these 17 July 20s at 0.1367. What this tells me is he's averaging in.

These are examples of positions he's averaging into. I would wager more often than not. It's not concrete. Again, to always keep it a buck with you guys. I can't say that with certainty because it could be that as he's getting this one order filled, it's getting pieced up and he's just returned with an average price. That's like that. But the reason why I deduce more likely than not that these are averaged into is that if he's able to get fills on bigger positions further out in time, which are less liquid, he's very likely to be able to get full fills on positions near a term that are smaller.

I think we both like live streams way more than videos because he has way more live streams than he does videos. Four years ago. So okay. So he's already talking about a squeeze here. What's the date on this? I forgot. There's somewhere you hover. There it is. Four September 2020. So he's talking about a squeeze here on four September. So it's about the same time frame. So here's his position as it sits here. So now let's take a look at what his next position looks like. So we can close this one out. That's June. Let's get to July. In the meantime, let's see what some of these look like. I think these are all gifts. Love that. Absolutely love that. Okay. So now we're into July. And he's now added a much more significant. A much more significant. Share position. And let's see what's rolled off. I got to slide this a little further out of the way. So here's what's rolled off. 16 April is still there. Jan 15 is still there. Double time. Triple time. He's added. He's added to it. October is still there. 17 July is gone. And that would that would have been eight. So he did not.

This is another really, really important note. Because I know a lot of people all the times speculate like did he exercise? Did he exercise? This is another example where I can tell he did not exercise these options. There's a very specific way I can tell he did not exercise any of these options that we see in here. From his previous portfolio because these came due. These 17 July's they rolled off and he ended up buying shares. Rointit he says not enough cash to exercise them. That's a great point. But that is not what tells me definitively. There's another thing that's even more certain than not having enough capital because it always could be argued. He added capital to the account and we have no way to prove or disprove that by the way. We really don't eat it could or could not have happened we wouldn't know. Cost average. That's exactly correct. So both lands and H or spot on. I can look at the change in his cost basis. Here we have 500 shares at 516 and change.

We obviously average down the lowest basis he had in here was an eight. Well, let me go back over here. Sorry. The lowest basis he had in here was a six in a 12. So the way that this would work is if he exercised these he would have taken 500 shares times 100. His basis would be this 12 plus the debit he paid in this case, 0.18. So it would have been 1218 drive his basis up. Same thing even with this six, this six 1367 would have moved this basis up not down. Sedrick says so we rolled them. No, he did not roll them. He just took a loss is what happened. He absolutely grabbed more options across the board, but there's nothing to roll. So if you want to call it a roll, there's nothing necessarily structurally wrong with calling it that, but it's essentially not what happened though. Those would have came down for a full loss. So he would have lost the investment on both of these. These two are now gone right now.

Yeah, well, that's kind of the problem, you know, with all those fucking Cormin out there, they're real, real excited to try to, you know, take a core temperature, which on the marine officer side of the house, that is literally like it's literally not going to happen.

Titty says I saw it on Newton's video today. I'll text him. I didn't watch this video today. Let me text him. I'll see what he says. I just asked him. Yeah, this, I mean, this looks, looks the same to me. All right, so that's the end of July. I want to finish going through this post first. So this looks like he's starting to win people over. And you can tell that about four years ago, people are, yeah, people are starting to come around. Which that's really interesting. So it tells me it took about a year, it seems. Also, there's 151 apes in here, which is sick, but we're very close to 169. So if there is maybe, maybe if your grandma is interested in GameStop or something, it would be a perfect time to invite her in and let her know that she can be part of a childish joke. Okay, this is just a lot of people talking. I was curious. I'm going to be timely month and let's see what this is. Huge news going to be month and update on Monday. What's your target sitting on eight calls? No precise target just up. Okay. GCA says, please don't ever say 69 and grandma in the same sentence",

And he likes the positions being about the same. And he got those for 15 cents. And then he also added the tens closer to the money. Still low delta, thousand of those. And he got these for 20 cents.

I don't actually think that myself personally. And it's for a bunch of different reasons. But the main thing is like none of these positions are even like remotely close to causing anything like that. Even in a stock that's hard to borrow, these are still really, really small positions. And by going this far out in time, it really will depend on entirely where the stock is around this point. The entire purpose and function, I have a video about gamma.

Let's August, here's September, 612 to 832. Same size across the board, same options across the board. So he's just holding. He's still just holding. 16-Sep. Same. No change. Didn't add any shares. What I'm trying to identify now is when do these ox roll off? I want to know when he catches in on those, assuming that he does.

So it takes us to September. Oh, he does a bunch of intramont updates. That's interesting. Let's take a quick look at this because I still think he's adding money, by the way. Let's take a look at these ones. I'm going to move this over. And then let's grab this again. And let's take a look together.

Gain, 802, 910, 93, cash, 85, 38, 80, 804, value, 973, 83, 804. So now what we can do is just a quick analysis. We can look at the change. So now we can see a few things. The first thing is the total value of the portfolio moved by 150,000. And the total gain moved by 153, 153, so this looks completely fine, like these line up perfectly. Right? So this plus this equals this. So this tells me that no money is moved. So now we continue. Dr. Zeyes says he holds the same position until 19-Nove. Yeah, that's cool. What, what I'm, Dr. Zeyes, well, for everybody, I don't know if you guys know, the whole point of this live stream is to go through this in detail. So I respect that you are providing the read ahead. But what I'm doing is I'm analyzing not just what changes he makes to his position. I'm analyzing what happens to the cash, how he behaves with respect to stuff like that. So that's my objective here. So now, total gain, can you guys see this excel sheet, by the way? I can't tell how much is on the screen. I can try to squish it down a bunch. TG is 111127.33. And then cash. What I'm going",

I try to not have, I don't like skipping cells when filling stuff in because it's annoying. So what I'll do is I'll move like those calculated cells to the end like over here, something like this. Okay, so cash. See, like this is, this is a giant difference. 250, 016.79. That's a giant change. Value 150111679. So something specific is going on here. So like this. Here, money moved. I can tell you money moved. Because again, what I'm doing is I'm looking at the variance in the value of the portfolio. That tells me it's 527,000. I can look at the variance in total gains and then the cash. And then if these don't line up, something moved. So between these, these two added, gives me 549,000, which should account for that total delta. This should be that, but it's not. So in this case, it's very clear that money moved.

You got to look at everything because this isn't the same shit, right? October is gone. So he's now down in options position. So very likely, so very likely this is something that he offloaded. Like he obviously wouldn't have taken it, well, he could have taken it into expiration, but we're not, we're not there at expiration. So this is still 22 September, September, October. So then in that case, he would have unwound his oct. And then what, again, this is another important part of the fingerprinting. Because today's date in here is 22 September. Was it here in 16-sep? It was here in 16-sep. So between 16-sep and 22-sep is when he unwound that position. And again, the reason why that matters is because these were expiring on 16 oct. So he probably took them down right after this, I would imagine. If not right before this, about a month early. Again, that's a massive, massive, massive, important piece of data. It's because it tells me he didn't hold this all the way into expiration, like we've seen in a few others. So this is now gone. Also",

I'm not a business person and I don't know to what extent the SEC and lawsuits impacted GameStop and Ryan Cohen's work. NFT marketplace was failure because of SEC as an example. But I don't, but I feel like it would have been a no-brainer to rebrand everything in 2021. And use a logo that the community would identify, pump out, yep, higher margin merge. Yeah. Okay. Got it. Super helpful for my boy Newton. And let me catch up to you guys. Day swag says any discrepancies would be RK adding money for external accounts. Yeah, it would be money moving. It would absolutely be money moving in some capacity. So Vladimir Offpun says, Day swag, no, he's selling some contracts. No, that doesn't that doesn't jive because if he's selling contracts and not reinvesting it, guess where it goes right here, amigo. So that's why his cash went up is because selling contracts and then he did something with the like he didn't do anything with the cash. So when there's a variance, again, that's why I'm tracking this. When there's a variance between the account value after accounting for total gain and cash, Vladimir Offputin says he buys other contracts, but he didn't. Like I dog, I don't know what's going on with you",

When there's a variance between the account value after accounting for total gain and cash, Vladimir Offputin says he buys other contracts, but he didn't. Like I dog, I don't know what's going on with you today off Putin. Normally you are on Putin, but you are off Putin right now. You're really off Putin. That's why there's literally what we're looking at. There's no variance in any of these. There's no added contracts, no added lots, no new contracts added to this. There's no new shares added to this. No change, price paid. There's no change in any of it. But again, what I can see is that there is a change in value. And again, for off Putin, this is where you're on Putin. Because again, I agree. I think some of this is from the options that he closed out for a profit. But when you close an option out for a profit, it's going to get placed into cash. Look at change in price paid. Sure. So we have price paid down here. So we have 4.11. We have the 10 calls at 20. We have the 15s at 14. We have the 17s at 15. We have the 16 April 21s at 40. And we have the 15 Jan 21s 20s. These are the same exact things. Nothing change, man. Again, that's my point.

That was not rolled into new positions. Nothing changed. But there is a variance in his account value that I can see. So because of that variance, let me make sure. So you guys can see that. It's this column here that I'm most concerned about. This column shows me variance. So again, I'm tracking all of those things. That's why that's literally why I'm looking at this. And based on looking at this again, like money moved in this scenario. The value delta of the portfolio here is 527. And what it should have been considering these two is 549. So this tells me money came out of the account more likely than not. Like 22k moved. Don't aware. Don't know why, but it moved. I can see it. So we continue our digging.

The reason why the cost basis changed is because a line item trade is now gone. Right. So if we have a long call that has a price paid that comes up expiration time for him to manage it, whatever it is. That is originally captured here. Then when he chooses to sell the long call, price paid will come down to account for that long call as a line item disappearing. That's exactly why you see it go from 162 to 139 is because a position went away. As that long call goes away, it moves into cash. So this changing again, like the price paid here for the analysis that we're doing in the 6L sheet, it literally doesn't matter because it's going to be captured. The way it's going to be captured is because I'm tracking the difference between total gain cash and value that is all of the possible buckets for the money to be in at a given point in time unless it is removed from the bucket. So in this case, I can tell you its money was removed from the bucket and it's because of the variance between",

So in this case, I can tell you its money was removed from the bucket and it's because of the variance between these. So it's exactly how I can track between yellow updates if there's changes to the position or if there's changes to the cash. And again, I have no context as to for the cash side of things, why what changes, but I can validate if it changes. So again, that's literally the entire point of doing this is so that we can get a sense of how these things move. So now back at it. Last one we know is 8 oct. Now we have 15.

No matter what happens, whether he adds a position, whether he adjusts a current position, whether he takes cash in or out, I will see it. Because if he sells some of a position, and then let's say for an example, if he sells some of his position but then buys some more of the same position, I'll still see it because the price chain, the price paid for that individual line item will show a variance. I will be able to detect it. Again, that's why doing this line by line is really informative because we've already seen a few changes. So now the TG here is 1902, 827.33. Then we have cash, 250, 299.5. So cash decreased slightly. I don't know why, but slightly. 2293, 099.5. So cash came down slightly, but the variance lines up. Interesting. So something happened here. I don't know what. I have to earmark this. So my best guess is again, I don't know why 12350 moved, but 12350 moved. Now, even though these line up telling me that there was no change to the position, like we did take something. Because if this 123 moved and it's not reflected in any of these other positions, because again, they would have moved, something happened.

This is, you know, 131399808. So this literally is just like a small rounding error. I'm not worried about that. That's just missing a decimal.

Like this, that's not normal. That is not normal. The fact that this position was showing over half a million dollar gain. And then we don't rest a stop order is absolutely insane. It's absolutely insane. It's incredible. But that's not normal. Because think of it this way, he's holding something here that the gain represents again, 600,000 gain, 600,000 gain.

So what this again tells me is that he's not using things like stops. And it seems like what I'm seeing so far is him basing his options exits, not based on some sort of profit target for the option, but based on time. That's what it looks like to me. Because if you had some sort of profit target for your option, you would follow the value of the option and capture it when it's at its zenith because options decay. Vladimir says maybe he likes to stock and doesn't sweat the value. I don't disagree with you, but what I'm identifying here, though, is a methodology for using options because the problem with options is that they do decay. So when I look at a 10 call, even though these are slightly in the money, they still will decay. That's the tricky part when you trade options is it's not just a function of if you like something, it goes up. Like that's part of it. But even if you're correct, these will decay.

And again, quick options 101 to figure out in Shrenzig value for a call, we just take the last price and the strike price out of it. So in this case, last price is 1138. You take the 10 strike out. So that gives us a dollar 38. That tells me my in Shrenzig value out of this. So the mid price here, we can use whatever he was quoted at. So he was quoted at 340. So we need 340 minus 138, 340 minus 138. And he has a thousand of these. And then their option. So there's another hundred. So right now in time value, he has 202,000",

So whether or not we like GameStop to the upside or whatever the case is, that's part of the equation obviously. But you're still holding a decaying tool options decay rather quickly. So even though his are like right at the money, they're actually going to be close to the height of their theta decay curve. So now what I'm very carefully honing in on is when does he start managing these 15 Jan options? Because again, I can tell you based on price movement so far, it's not predicated on a price target. Clearly. He's just trading it to the upside. So then it leads me to believe that he's trading it based on time, which is fascinating. So we did five know. Let's go to 12 know. 12 know.

I mean, I really don't know. I really don't know if I would say that personally. Like based on what I'm seeing here, this isn't bad, but it's really not good. So it's it's hard to say. It's really, really hard to say because what I can tell you is that his most recent options trades have a very different field than what I'm seeing here. It's actually remarkable to see the difference because in this example, if his thesis for whatever reason didn't play out, this is like again, it's as he says, it's a true yolo. If his thesis wasn't fortunate enough to play out, what you get in part is luck. Part of it is absolutely good luck. Now it's obviously a ton of research and it's doing the homework and it's having a good ideas. I'm not discounting his effort, but you still need luck for it to do what you want in your time frame. And the stuff that he's trading absolutely require a massively healthy dose of luck is what it is. So that gives us a 12-no. Let's get to 19-nove. See no change here.

It's actually really, really easy for us to see what his thoughts were. We can straight up take a look at these same time frames. That's kind of the nice part about being able to line these up. So for the group, is there a specific time frame in here that we're most interested in seeing what his thoughts were at that time? Because if so, we'll just jump into one of those videos really fast.

Yeah, I mean, and again, like, it's really important to always remind ourselves that genius and crazy are essentially the same thing. And the what differentiates them is the outcome, right? Because if for whatever reason, GameStop went down another path like so many other stocks and this didn't happen, then it would be a complete different story. We wouldn't be spending any time looking at this because he would have been yet another blown up trader. But what we're what we have to be really, really careful when we evaluate stuff like this is again, it's survivorship bias. We're seeing somebody that was able to very, very, very effectively apply an incredible skill set. And again, lining up with a healthy dose of good fortune and luck with the performance of things.

Cedric says, now this is not that outlier. If you looked at fair value of the company before and after his options, you would understand the business double their so unfair fair value. Yeah, no, no, I agree with you. I'm saying the research is good. But again, I think you guys, at least in this context, I think it's really important to understand the broader effect. So for example, GameStop, it could have done what Wells Fargo's, what Wells Fargo did. As GameStop was pivoting as they were growing in value, they could have been involved in some sort of scandal. Easy, they could have Wells Fargo did. They could have done an SBB style thing, not manage their risk appropriately. They could have had a terrible investment into a brand new venture that didn't make sense. So like, again, the value that he perceived is there and it makes sense.

But there is a massive amount of good fortune that goes into something moving along as it happens to move along. And that's just from a very, very specific circumstance talking about the individual stock. This doesn't talk about our broader economic condition and the fact that we happened to not go into some sort of broad economic recession. There happened not to have been World War III during this that led to the stock market in and of itself collapsing or even imploding. So that happened to not happen when a global pandemic launched and started leaving to essentially countries closing down for prolonged periods of time. All I'm highlighting is that it was excellent research. In excellent thesis, it was traded excellently. Despite all of those pieces of excellence, there is still luck. There will always be luck to a degree. Now, as you increase your skill set, you'll find that fortune seems to smile upon you more frequently. But there still is luck. And it's important to know that there's luck. So yeah, anyways, it's so I think somebody said like a specific time frame. Steven Sealgall, that's what a great name.

Seatrix says, but if you take a trade with 30 chance of hitting over 60 by DD, I don't call it luck. No, it's called expected return. But the problem that you're mistaken, Cedric with your analysis, which is exactly what Robo is highlighting, is the problem with having a possibility of a 100 loss on a 30, 60 thing is still negatively expectant long term. So it still is luck, it's complete luck in that instance. Again, this is the confusion. When we're trading or investing, we're trying to create a higher probabilistic outcome. But when you tie that with total concentration of entire net worth or at least investible capital, you are one bad hand away from being eviscerated.

Unless again, if there's one of the things in here that we want to investigate, because that's why I would watch the video, or at least comb through it, is to see if there's any inclination or any hint as to what his thoughts were. Ryan O'Siss, he had over 50 stocks in his portfolio until that it's the Warren Buffett idea, not swinging at bad pitches until the white one presents itself to Keith. This was the right pitch. Yeah, definitely. You could tell. And it was something that he was purely convicted in. It was a 100 convicted yellow. It's the only reason why you would concentrate to this degree. So yeah, completely agree there. 19, no, all right, 25, no, 1, 2, 3, 4. Okay, so this does look like we see change, and it looks like we see change in his options position. Because the variance here now is one of these options is gone. The 17s are gone. So here, this is 25, no, damn it. I keep clicking the wrong thing. That's fascinating. Why the 17s? Why the 17s?

So one of the things, one of the things that I can see is that he's, he missed an options trade, meaning he moved something. Vladimir says his cost basis dropped about 15k. Yeah, it's because he lost his options play. We can see that clear as day, right? So down here in his last position, he still had 15, Jan 21, 17s. He still had those, but he got rid of them. It's 25, no, I'm, this is fascinating. This is absolutely fascinating. Because I think we're starting to see how he unwinds his trades, which again, it looks like it's based on time. So exited 15, Jan 21, 17 calls. So now I want to see what he does with the remainder of these. My guess is he's going to start moving them. Now what I don't understand is why the 17s? Because tens make sense, they're in the money. 15s make sense. They're at the money. 20s, I don't understand why the 20s are the 17s, like how he",

Don't understand that choice. So he exited the 15, Jan 17 calls, and then I'm going to put, he kept the 20s, he kept the tens or the 15s and the tens. Very, very interesting. No change to shares. Very cool. So cash went up by 260K. I'm assuming that's the proceeds from the 17s. I can't peg. I can't peg what happened. Why the 17s are not the 20s. The cost basis on the 17s was 15 cents.

So that's why you see the cash delta elevate here. Yep. So here, it's very clear that he took those 17s down. Why he took the 17s down. I really don't know. But we'll get a little more clarity as we go. 30 know. Exactly, exactly as anticipated, exactly as anticipated. This makes sense. So the total gain here was 195, 55, 65, 7.63.

We had an expansion of 865K total in value. What I can see here is he still has the tens and the 20s. So now I understand what he's doing. He's taking down the options that are closer to the money.

It's like the same thing with like when you're priced out of a Roth IRA, I've been priced out of a Roth IRA forever now. But you can still contribute to a Roth IRA in a few different ways. One of the ways you could do it is through a backdoor contribution, which is it sounds real sketchy, but it's not. It's a really well-known pattern. And there's just certain documents you have to file informs to file, but it's accepted. It's nothing nefarious. And then the other thing is like you can still contribute to a Roth if you're so inclined, but you just don't get any tax benefit from doing so.

And you can also add more to it beyond that. You're just not getting any sort of tax benefit at that point. Vladimir says you can't deduct for contributions to a Roth that's after tax. Yeah, sorry. I was talking about IRAs in general, but yeah, obviously the difference between a standard or traditional IRA and Roth is the tax treatment traditional being you'll be taxed. You'll essentially have your income tax deferred and then your taxed on the back end, Roth, it's the inverse. You get taxed up front and then it's taxed deferred on the back end, which is why people get priced out of Roth super fast, which is super, super annoying because Roth is more appealing to most of us for a lot of different reasons, but they make it really annoying to maintain exposure to them. So yeah, I don't think going back to the original though with what we're looking at here, I don't think that he's like paying for insurance or anything on these or on his portfolio yet.

I even added a bunch of decimal points. I don't, I have no idea what the difference is between these. These look completely fine. I'm just going to label as a rounding discrepancy.

Now for the tens, they're going to be so far in the money that he probably doesn't care about the extrinsic value. We can take a look at those. So today is 22d's. Here. And the tens are going to be so buried that the amount of extrinsic value that's decaying on those will be probably insignificant. But on the 20s, it's going to be actually very significant.

So let's just call it 19 minus 10. It gives us nine. And these are at. Call it 892 minus. Yeah. So these essentially are like a one delta. Yeah, there's like no time value left in these at all. So that's why it doesn't care about those. But the 20s are all time value. And they're at the peak of their theta decay curve. This is when theta decay is actually really, really, really, really pronounced. So you can see on these 20s, he's losing five cents a day. So if you take five dollars times his 1000 contracts that he has, he's literally losing five grand a day by holding these. And it's because we are in the most pronounced phase of this.

The other thing is it's up to the broker on the way that they choose to route your order or the market maker. So if I'm buying shares of GameStop and it happens to go through a market maker who happens to decide to route my personal order through the dark pool, that's where it'll go. So dark pools are accessible. So anyways, one of the questions that we had is like, let's go back into May. Kind of like this pre-squeeze time frame. And see what kind of 5,000 blocks we saw.

Yeah. Okay. So there's none. When did the squeeze start in May? Dr. Zay says does anyone remember the origin of how 5,000 blocks? It's just from when he was buying options, which is that that's another funny thing that I see is that people assimilate like 5,000 blocks shares. But he was buying 5,000 blocks of options, which is completely different. And the reason why options matters because 5,000 lots in the options world is a big trade. In the share world, it's small. It's insignificant. But in the options world, those kinds of positions are larger. So the reason why he was used, and it wasn't just 5,000 blocks that he was using, by the way, it's definitely more than that.

He just happened to settle on that number to start scaling into his position for a few of them. But he had other sizes too. So anyways, as we go through here, let's do cap it at 5,000. So there's no, well, that doesn't make sense. Because I saw, yes, all like a 50, okay, so maybe we'll cap it at like 5,500. Okay. So we can see that there's a handful here. So let's do the rest of May like this. And then let's limit this by 5,000 now and see if we can, there we go. And then let's change this to 5,000. There we go. So in the 31st of May, there is a bunch of these blocks. Well, Rhinoces 512 is when he came back cool. So then we'll just do, we'll do like, here to here. 17th, I'm going to zoom this in then because it's going to be too much, I think. Zero. So leading into his return, from all of May, there was nothing at 5,000 blocks. So then let's go back and look at April really quick. Nothing at 5,000.

So yeah, doesn't look like, doesn't look like there's anything tying that, which is also really, really interesting actually. Because here's the other thing that I find very curious. And again, maybe we can get the tinfoil hacks. It's probably coming up on time. The roaring kitty. So if we take a look at this, in updated 13G, if he got out of Chui at, well, let's just call it 6ep because he's running out of time. If he got out of Chui at or before this date, he owes an update in 13G within 10 days. Or the whatever point in time that he drops below 5 ownership. So here's the other problem with this is when we look at this, we could say he is doing this preemptively and to indicate that he might be putting down Chui or not, we don't know. But it's the point where his ownership drops below 5. So he could have opted to start unwinding his position earlier. And then he could have eventually crossed that threshold or not crossed that threshold. So HockeyNuts says, is it 10 days or 10 trading days? That's a great clarifying question. Let's double check. For amended 13G SEC filings, is it calendar or trading days? Calender days. Interesting. So this says for amended 13G SEC filings, the deadlines are based on calendar days.",

If there is changes in the information previously reported, if the amendment reflects a change in ownership exceeding 10 or more, it must be filed within 10 calendar days after the end of the month in which the change occurred. Very interesting. So this looks like there's a fucking giant window here. 45 calendar days after the end of the calendar year. So this means essentially he has until the end of 2024 and then 45 calendar days into 2025 to file the amended 13G. That's what that means. And then I'm going to go to the SEC and check it directly there. Actually, I'm going to ask chat GPT for a source so that we can look at it for ourselves. Because I've learned not to trust chat GPT much at all. I want to see the site. Yeah, so beneficial ownership exceeding 10 filings must be made within five business days.

Passive investor is an entity or individual that owns more than 5 of a company's stock, but does not seek to influence or control the company. I think we knew that. These investors typically hold securities for investment purposes only. I think we know that. So initial filing, a passive investor must file schedule 13G within 10 calendar days after acquiring more than 5 of the company's stock. I think we know that. If the investor's ownership exceeds 10, or there is a material change, ownership increasing or decreasing by more than 5, that's an important note.

Where other schedule 13G filers passive investors, the amendments shortened the initial filing deadline from 10 days to 5 business days. Business days. In addition for all schedule 13G filers, the amendments generally require that an amendment to be filed 45 days after the calendar quarter, which a material change occurred rather than 45 days of the calendar year. Interesting. Amendments accelerate 13G. Okay. Interesting. So then this, their election matters. So if they're a G that's 13D1C, uh, all 13G's be amended within 45 days after the end of the calendar quarter, in which any material change occurred under the current rules except certain situations they have 45 days at the calendar year.

I haven't really spent a whole lot of time thinking about like the perception of that relationship and stuff. But I don't, I don't see why, especially like if he stays associated with GameStop, if you think about it, like GameStop right now is essentially Cohen. Right. That's that's where all the values coming from. And it looks like based on his previous work, it seems like he really liked Cohen. Right. Like he talks about him actually quite a lot. So I don't, I don't see him not liking Cohen. I think one of the problems is at least what I can tell from the ape community is it seems like the apes believe that Cohen should prioritize a squeeze.

A squeeze does not benefit the company to a significant degree. Now it can help. I'm not saying it's detrimental. But what I'm saying is the focus for a company and a CEO of a company should be literally, hold on, I'm getting hit up. They're confused. It should be the operation of the company. So yeah. I think for what I can tell from the apes is that the apes seem to be obviously like laser focused on this giant squeeze, which I understand. But from a CEO perspective, a squeeze is not like, a squeeze is short lived, right? Like that's only a thing that happens and then will go away shortly thereafter. So then it's a function of how do I operate a company profitably and grow it? So I think from Cohen's perspective that is and should be his focus is growing the company.

So yeah, I think when I look at their approach so far, it seems like it's really focused on trying to, I can't see, I know there's something, but I can't see like what their end vision is in mind.
