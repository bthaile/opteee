The fact that I have to look tells you how strong the flavor is there apricot apricot okay that's a yep that sounds like a lacroy style flavor. That's what we got the one. Well welcome back thanks for joining us again. No problem. So we were talking a little bit throughout the past couple weeks and you mentioned that things got a little bit busy and the cryptocurrency market especially with everything that we've been seeing going on so I would love to start the dialogue there with you know obviously we have the collapse of FTX and then we're starting to see some of these dominoes falling what are you seeing in the cryptocurrency space and how is it impacting you day today. It's not directly impacting me. It's pretty clear that people are just pulling back I mean people are basically hunkering down going into their shells you know curling up like armadillos whatever you want whatever animal reference you want to bring out right no one really knows what's going on",

I think people think they're overreacting on the other hand when FTX collapsed it went very quickly from there is no problem to it's a technical problem to they have it liquidity problem to. They're bankrupt to they're all complete criminals so the narrative has changed dramatically and I change so quickly that I think now people are. Just so I know people have pulled out of you know the safest exchanges like gone completely back and pulled all their money back to a US bank in US dollars completely out of the space so that's sort of where everyone is now volatility in the. In the major coins sort of dropped back a lot in the last couple of days I mean it's almost back to pre FTX levels now so I think probably people are assuming that certainly Bitcoin and Ethereum are now. Kind of can survive independent of this kind of thing. Another the only things with any options on them anyway.

Realize volatility that's actually kind of fascinating if I didn't look at that before you said that and that surprises me why is that so low I don't get that or were we just expecting this to draw out longer and well I mean. Realize I mean the reason I these low is just it's not really moving like crypto pre FTX had basically been sitting around you know between 18,000 and 19,000 forever. Volumes as low as I'd ever seen it like one day vol was you know trading in the 30s you know so the fact now I think 7 day vol last I looked at it was in the 60s or something so it's low but it's not ridiculously low. It's basically the FTX shocks gone away and we're just back to where we've always been and no one's really projecting that that's going to cause a major problem in those points.

Yeah and I actually was talking with a buddy of mine who banks with finance and he was saying that a while ago they instituted like a thousand a day with draw limit or something like that I don't bank with finance so I have no idea I couldn't speak to it intelligently he just shared that with me and that actually surprised me a little bit. Have you heard of anything like that I'm just curious from like a. Yeah, I have not I have a lot of different tiers depending on your volume and so I'm pretty doubtful that if you're throwing millions of dollars through their day they're putting a thousand dollar limit on you but I have no idea about that I don't really want to speculate sure yeah I think that makes sense so.

Well the actual implosion was very heavily driven by a crush like the reverse squeeze on FTT because basically they'd collateralized all of their loans with FTT they were the major holders of it and then that was just pushed massively against them so that's sort of the mechanics of it it's sort of like there's a run on a stock you know it's very similar to when something like lemon or best turns broke in that case and I think people made the mistake of thinking that FTX was. And I think that FTX was in exchange in the way that I don't know the CBO is right and people are like I can't believe they're doing this with customers money and the CBO wouldn't but FTX wasn't in exchange in that sense they called themselves that but they were really so and everyone knew that they were intertwined with our made it so yeah FTX took customers money gave it to our made it and",

So the problem is that people thought it was more of a perception thing people were horrified to find out FTX was doing this whereas I think most people in the industry kind of we knew that anyway that wasn't the problem the problem was that our made it was somehow managing to lose tons of money at the same time and everyone thought our made it was making tons of money so that's the mystery how you manage to lose all that money trading I mean it's not it's not really easier to lose money trading than it is to make it right because if you know a way to lose money well you know what just take the other side and you're great and I kind of think that they the only way you're guaranteed to lose money trading is crossing bit ask spread wrecking up costs that's the only asymmetry between profitable strategy and and the opposite losing strategy.

They're losing a lot doesn't explain how that they lost eight billion or whatever right but that would be a guaranteed way to lose it's also that's a little bit with I know a lot of people who had very simple stand-up strategies that were working on FTX really simple ones and like the sort of things that would work in the equity markets 15 years ago and everyone was just explaining away that they were going to get a lot of money trading. They were just explaining away their success by saying these markets are just inefficient you know there's a lot of dumb retail money just pushing things out of line.

And they're like we know we are it's a loss leader it's exactly the same you know that retouch stores advertise TVs for 50 bucks so people come in the door that was if that was the plan it wasn't a failure of risk management it was a failure of business plan so I think that's where risk management wouldn't have helped. Got it I guess the way that I was thinking about it is like if you're running that kind of promotion let's say right like the fifty dollars to get somebody in the door that you would let it run for a period of time until you stop it and say like this isn't working anymore but it seems like that's like you're saying that point is besides the point given the context of this scenario.

You know I there's a lot of stuff he said beforehand that now makes people go yeah we should have seen this coming like he talked about having linear utility function and only being interested in the expected value of bets. Which is insane right because if you've got a billion dollars you you're not prepared to bet everything on a 51 coin but if you've got a dollar you might because you know it's like whether you believe economics or not in any sense the idea of diminishing marginal utility makes a lot of sense you know a billion dollars the extra dollar to that person means nothing whereas to a homeless person it means everything so.

Yeah it's I was recently re-listening to the the psychology of money I'm not sure if you ever read that book it's interesting in some parts it's very simple but one of the things I like about that book though is it talks about the concepts of luck and risk in how two people with a similar skill skill.

    "text": "with cryptocurrency don't necessarily seem to hold up longer term so I think the idea of using coins as an offering instead of using equity. It gave a lot of startups a way of coming to market much quicker but the reason they could do that is because there was no regulation right so. See what this is and there's a whole bunch of things to unpack here there's a big problem with the whole crypto and defy space in particular where you've got the the tech bros for better word. Confidently reinventing something that we've used in banking for a hundred years and it's like oh this is what we need and we're like do we already have that it's just we don't have that in the defy world and. People it's very fashionable to sort of say regulations are holding us back and so forth but you've got it we may have outdated regulations we may have too many but every single one of them was put in place for a valid reason at the time so going to a completely deregulated space yeah what do you think was going to happen right I mean this is sort of in a way inevitable right it's like kids throwing sand around a sand pit and then someone gets it in their arms. It's just a matter of time. Well I also can't help but get a kick you know one of the big things that people talk about with",

Well I also can't help but get a kick you know one of the big things that people talk about with cryptocurrency is you know the privacy even though obviously the transactions are all tracked on the blockchain you can find them all right now they're saying for FTX is part of the chapter 11 that essentially everybody's information might essentially be released as part of that you know if you've made a deposit or a withdrawal like that information is so. Like that information is going to get bucketed in with it so to me I just look at one of the other proposed use cases of cryptocurrency being an on emity a little bit of separation from transactions and it seems like even that is starting to to fall away it's not to the same degree obviously using a credit card but still the fact that you know you are supposedly able to make transactions that are very difficult to trace yeah. A day after this happened people were looking at FTX addresses and saying this is happening on ethoscan and people were tracking it in real time and I mean one of the other big arguments is that people then were saying against the exchanges is you know everyone's well it's not your currency if it's not your",

We used to have stock certificates and bearer bonds and people got rid of them for a very good reason because if I know you've got them I can come to your house and hold you up and take them off you that's the same as oh your self custodying great I'll just come and hold a gun at your head until you give me the key it's like we did that and we decided that banks were a better idea so again it's kind of reinvent the wheel. Well it's not even reinventing the wheel it's forgetting that we had a thing called the wheel and then saying wouldn't it be great if we had a wheel and then inventing a worse one.

It's so funny you say that I made a tweet the other day because I forgot what I was looking for online and I came across like a electronic dog collar that was like a smart dog collar with like an app and all this stuff which I get it for some people that might make sense but for me I chuckled at it because like my I don't even have a collar on my dog I just watch my dog and train my dog not to run away and then that's it he doesn't know collar let alone a smartphone attached to his neck so.

Right it's like yeah we can do this like out we I'll be great. Yeah no but we see it all the time right it's like people you know you have electric door handles on your car. We had door handles that worked fine and they actually worked better because if your battery failed you'd have so open the door. Right you know it's that kind of thing or if you if you break a mirror now on your car it's a thousand bucks to get it fixed because it's full of sensors where is it used to be a mirror was like 20 bucks and you broke it who cares you just go to the record you're out and get another one. So it's like you said it's like look I'm not saying cars now are way better than they were 30 years ago way better right on a cold day you don't have to wonder if your car will start of course it will start.

Well it's interesting though to hear you know about the crypto space so thank you for sharing some of your thoughts around that now. Dovetailing us back to your heart and soul and it's actually probably not even really your heart and soul I'm just calling it that is options and derivatives in equity's markets and other markets. We had a couple of conversation points that you sent over and like I was telling you before we started there is a couple of these that I want to hit because I think they're really important I've heard you talk about them before and then there's some of these that are new to me and I want to talk about one of those because I think they're interesting so. The first one in here that stands out to me that I haven't heard yet is getting the trilogy backwards and it's an interesting concept to me but I'd like to get your thoughts on what that means.

Oh yeah okay I can kind of okay so there are three things you need to do a trade successfully and when I say trade I don't I mean individual trade or a trading strategy you need an edge you need a statistically valid reason that you should make money from this trade so you need a loaded point that is the most important thing that's the first thing the second thing is based on that edge you need risk control and that means largely. Sizing that individual trade correctly putting that trade in the context of a portfolio. Then you need to have the psychological tools in place to persist with that trade if things are going badly. What a lot of people decide though is that those three things should happen in the opposite order and you'll see things like this where people like the most important thing is discipline.

I mean if that was the issue when you really worked on it like that I'd have a little bit more tolerance for it but it's still not the most important thing risk is a little bit similar it's a little more technical but again risk management is actually kinder easy certainly for an individual trader I'm not saying if you're the risk manager Goldman Sachs or whatever it's easy because then it's very you've just got a very complicated organization there but for an individual trade like it's not going to be a good deal. In individual options trade risks really easy oh you sold a sprig all yeah why don't you buy some two down to puts done that's your risk control and it's like it there's no magic to it it's like market risk is usually trivial to to handle so because it's trivial you don't get paid for that either like there's no magic to not taking stupid bits so you get paid for the",

Like a tough boxer is just going to get beaten up for longer unless that good if you're good and you're tough that's great you can take a punch and you can still win the fight but if all you are is tough you're just going to stand there and get beaten up for 12 rounds so again it's like it's in the context of being good then it's a good thing and it's like confidence right you want to be confident because you are good at something you don't expect to be good at something because you're confident. That's delusional it's not confidence. Yeah, yeah, I think in speaking of that confidence this actually leads to a nice stovetail that I wanted to touch on with you is I do think it's pretty common for new options traders you know when they find options and they start trading options I get the sense that a lot of them feel like because they're trading options they've now found an edge because they're not going to be good at something else.

Yeah, options are just an instrument I'm not an age and I think I think when people find options the first thing is they find all these structures you can put together right you know I am condor or Christmas tree or a ladder or whatever and they think that by choosing the correct structure they've got an edge and part of it is because like to do options you have to learn a lot of mechanics right.

What is it by the selling options or your buying options if you sell them in your shortfall if you're buying them your long vol that's pretty much it all that other stuff is just details if it makes you feel good fine but people you know like I should I do an iron condor or a butterfly I'm like they're exactly the same thing it's just just because ones at one strike and ones at two strikes doesn't make them intrinsically different it's like I don't know if you look at a professional option trade this book I don't decide to do a butterfly.

It isn't predictable so trading stocks is really hard because as simple as anything to understand but you've got to make a difficult prediction whereas options you do all the work up front the hard to understand but then the prediction you need is relatively easy but you've got to make that prediction you've got to actually go out and predict where volatility is going to be and a lot of people don't do that like even the ones who know that volatility's sorry options are not an edge I sell a straight on every Tuesday or whatever it's like well what if you're selling it too cheap you've still got to make the you still do the forecasting because you know there's a forecast every trade you do is implicitly a forecast right",

So for retail traders that want to be able to start making that forecast you and I talked last time and I think I talked to you a little bit about it I've I've done some implied volatility modeling myself and I do find it to be pretty arduous to keep up with but for somebody that's like just starting out what do you think an effective way to even begin down that path of forecasting volatility would look like for them. Okay, doing it through the time series methods of like measuring it projecting it forward using something like garch something like that it's probably not worth doing that. The reason is you're not going to be able to do it well enough to beat the people who do that all day like I'm very confident in saying that some average retail person is not going to have a better volatility model than the one I've got.

Mine's in a spreadsheet so doesn't have any colors in it but but my models no good compared to like I don't know Jane Streets or Susquehadas so I wouldn't I wouldn't trade on the basis of my model so that's not the way to do it. The way to do it is to look for idiosyncratic situations where volatility might be mispriced because you're looking at a risk premium right so look for situations where people are prepared to pay more for risk insurance than they should. It's like being a fireman you want to run towards the fire so whenever you have a situation where you think I really want to buy options right now you know because I don't know there's an election. There's an earnings event there's a third meeting.

Yeah so I honestly I would look somewhere else that's one of the problems I think a lot of retail have is that trying to play the same game as the professionals right and you will lose that's one of the reasons people retail lose is because they do the wrong thing you don't have to play that game there are other things you can do you can wait. You can trade only when these other events happen like you could make pretty good money trading just Fed announcements 10 times a year. I can't do that because if I tell my boss oh I'm going to trade 10 times a year and be like I'm not paying you to do that. I'm going to do another 240 days a year. So retail can do stuff that I can't but they also have to do stuff that I'm not doing.

Let's say I'm an art dealer and I'm like well I'm an art dealer I have to buy paintings so I'm just going to buy paintings I don't care what price I pay for it. Does that sound like a good business plan. Sounds right. Because that's what these people are doing they're saying I'm going to buy gamma. Every business has to buy things below what they're worth and sell them more than what they're worth. So it's like yeah buy and gamma is a great thing but if you get it cheap but selling gamma is a great thing as well if you sell it expensive. So I think a lot of people come in with this preconceived notion of the position they want rather than the edge they see. I mean there's no buying gamma just because it's just like I found out what options do I'm going to buy them but you're paying the wrong price.

Now the to start diving into this a little bit further. So I actually have found the same kind of the same kind of answer as you're highlighting with preferring short straddles versus strangles. I think I arrived at it probably because of a busted reason I thought just well I guess indirectly it circles back to a point I first started selling straddles it was because I just started noticing that I was getting paid more than the moves in general even though it seems you know kind of scary when I was doing this. And over time I started realizing that the straddles and I'd like your perspective on this point specifically.

Yeah it's it's difficult because a couple of days ago I can't remember when it was it was like Monday or Tuesday this week seems like years ago now right there was a day when the SP moved basically continuously the whole day in one direction and I think it went down but I again no idea. If you'd sold the straddle then the realized volatility was much higher than what you'd sold it at so if you'd just sold the straddle and gone away for the day you would have lost money. But had you sold the straddle and then hedged it throughout the day you actually ended up making money because the path it took was so easy to hedge because it just kept on going down smoothly and slowly so you could just keep selling futures all the way down. So that's a situation where I was short volatility my volatility forecast was completely wrong but I still made money because of just the path it took.

But I think you've got to make it as easy as possible to get valid feedback back from the market. See in terms of a forecast leaving aside what I said about strangle and sorry condors and butterflies being the same that was a different in different context and people again there are so many nuances and context dependent answers here that. There's no one rule here that applies to everything but the point I'm trying to make here is if you're short volatility there's not much different selling a strangle and a strangle in terms of the edge you're getting right. The difference is you're trading off lots of you're trading off percentage of wins against the size of the wins right and that's.

So speaking of that then and to shed just some additional context on the way that I've started to choose to to delta hedge especially short straddles is I've actually started opening up the delta range I will let it move within before I start delta hedging that's really the main selection criteria I've been trying to optimize over time and I'm wondering if you have any opinion on an optimal range I know you've studied this stuff obviously far more than I have I have a smaller data set that I've been back testing and just running studies on to get some ideas but curious your thoughts there. Yeah backtesting stuff like that's really dangerous because you'll follow the number that's worked really well on the past and it's probably going to be relatively meaningless like we don't really have a lot of options data right like we think that we do but we really only have liquid options data and a large number of products for like 15 years and you can make a good argument that it's not 15 years of independent data it's like regimes that last for years at a time so I think backtesting options is that testing anything is fraught with difficulties I think with options it's even worse particularly because then your delta hedging you've got all these other decisions you've got to make I think the",
