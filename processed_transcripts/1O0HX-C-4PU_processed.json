    "text": "at something like apple the way that I'm going to analyze price I mean just look at the difference in the chart it looks completely different and if you look at most other large cap stocks the chart will look something like this so what I'm highlighting to you is that when you look at something like GameStop or even things like biotech stocks it's not specific to just GameStop but there's a completely different series of catalysts that are moving the price and that leads to different price behavior and airgo a different requisite analysis needed in order to apply technical analysis because if you're applying standard technical analysis this will leave you behind over and over and over again so yeah things that I really like to wait in terms of analysis are price and volume right that's standard and for me that's one of the biggest things here because when you look at stuff like this the moving average are ascending they're widening in terms of the distance between them there's no reason technically from a moving average perspective why this would crater like that if these are doing that that typically means you'll get some level of continuation it's across all of them but it doesn't happen here and it's because of a bunch of structural reasons that lead this to behave very differently so I just wanted to clarify that I'm not saying that you can't apply technical analysis I do all the time it's",

    "text": "manage that position so it's already over a 50 Delta it's only got s days left to go so you don't want to not have the underlying in order to hedge these if you get an even moderate price accommodation and they fall further in the money because then you have to start hedging the rest of these that are now bigger by buying more and more shares notice the configuration here this is actually interesting to me 2,100 10,000 1,000 3,000 1,000 2,000 right that's a lot of shares and they're all stacked like that so as market makers go out and they have to buy the 24s by to cover the 24s I should say then that could conceivably push the 24 and a halfs in then the 24 and a halfs go in then we have to buy to hedge those and that could push us just enough to put us in the 25s which is a much bigger strike now we got to buy even more which can easily push you to the 25s and a half to the 2 sixes over the C and you get what I'm talking about this is essentially what starts a gamma squeeze now I don't want to get people's hopes up I think you would need much deeper options chains but it wouldn't surprise me to see a smaller element of that potentially go with that kind of buying Behavior because it's so low volume because it's so low",
