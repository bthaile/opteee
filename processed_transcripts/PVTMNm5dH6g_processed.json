So I'm going to walk you through how it makes money, how to set them up, how to scan for them, how to manage. I'm going to give you an example of a trade that I had earlier this year that shows the full life cycle and decision cycle along the entire path. I'm going to show you trade that I have on right now so that you can see how I found it. And then at the end of the video, I'm going to go through a couple questions from our Discord members, which you should join. And as you can tell, there's a lot of detail going to be in this video. That's by design. So it's going to be long feel free to skip around as needed. But I want you to have a good reference benchmark for the ratio put diagonals because this is a staple of mine. Now if you're familiar with the channel ratio diagonals will be very familiar to you because I trade them quite literally all the time. It gives me a bit of a more adjustable risk reward profile, which we'll talk about. So the ratio put diagonal in a nutshell, it's a directionally leveraged trading strategy designed to benefit from the downward price direction of something, whatever it is that you're trading. And it has a few legs. You'll see that there's two primary legs and then",

So the ratio put diagonal in a nutshell, it's a directionally leveraged trading strategy designed to benefit from the downward price direction of something, whatever it is that you're trading. And it has a few legs. You'll see that there's two primary legs and then there's kind of this optional leg, which we'll get into in a little bit. But the primary leg to start with is an in the money put that's greater than 60 days to expiration. So let's talk about those two components specifically. Why in the money? Why greater than 60 days to expiration? Great questions. The first question of why in the money? This allows me to do two things simultaneously. The first thing is I limit my theta decay. The further in the money you go, the more expensive your option will be, but the less time value and the more intrinsic value will be in that option. So if you get the moves that you want, you're paying more upfront, but you're going to recoup the vast majority of that cost, even if it doesn't move much, because it's intrinsic value that doesn't decay. The second most important thing is you get a better dollar for dollar move in the underlying. What does that mean? Let's take a look. The example that we're going to use for the previous trade is oh, and I originally started trading this to the downside a while ago when real estate was",

The example that we're going to use for the previous trade is oh, and I originally started trading this to the downside a while ago when real estate was doing really poor, the beginning of this year. So what I had on will walk through all of that. I'm just going to use it as an example now for some of the options selection criteria. So if oh goes down by one dollar, if I have something like these 91 delta puts, I get 91 cents for the dollar. So that means that as oh is moving, I'm seeing as much of that same move as I can with the options. What's the downside? They're more expensive. The other downside is your options aren't going to get those massive thousand percent compounding returns without a huge move. So you have to figure out what's right for you. And this is why we also add those kicker options sometimes. And the way to think about those kicker options, at least for me, is if I have some sort of stronger conviction and I really want to try to amplify the potential move, if I'm correct, I will buy cheaper out of the money options. Either the same expiration or closer in time, depending on what the chains look like. And what those do is they don't give me a big",

So if oh moves two, three bucks, let's say we grab these 50s delta puts is the kicker is it doesn't really matters. Not going to benefit us that much. But if oh for whatever reason, craters in falls out of bed, these will compound very quickly gain a lot of gamma very quickly. And then these can actually add a lot of profit potential. So this is kind of like a lower probability play that can amplify the overall return profile. So we now know why I select the delta that I do. My general approach here is in the money. So that means greater than 50 delta. The vast majority of the time it will be greater than a 60 delta. Sometimes I will go as far as a one delta. My typical target is around 80 delta. Now this is completely predicated on the options chain. So for example, if this was the trade I was looking at 94 DTE, which we'll talk about why that DTE is compared to something else in a second.

This is something that a lot of traders, especially smaller traders don't think much about because fortunately, if you're trading a one lot of two lot, it doesn't really matter. But if you're trading a 50 lot, a hundred lot, this is actually super limiting. So you'll find that these odd strikes, like the 57 and a half, the 62 and a half, they will have much lighter liquidity than the standard strikes, like 60, 55, so on and so forth. So part of it is finding the right mix, balancing all these different things, which does absolutely include liquidity. The reason why liquidity is so important is because as you go further out in time, liquidity will lighten. As you go deeper in the money, liquidity will lighten. So you can't be two hands off with your attention to liquidity because you need to exit the trade. That's how you make money in this thing. You have to be able to sell the long options for a big profit. So if you're trading something that you're really forcing, trying to get your way in, that can be really difficult",

So if you're trading something that you're really forcing, trying to get your way in, that can be really difficult in order to find a reasonable exit point. So that's why you have to find a balance specifically with respect to liquidity in the options chain. Now as we look at the different expirations, we know Theta decay accelerates once you get within 60 DTE. So the vast majority of the time, my long options will be greater than 60 DTE. I will then bracket by how long I'm expecting to hold the trade. Sometimes I'll go 90 DTE. Sometimes I'll go 180. Sometimes I'll go way out over a year. If it's something I'm really expecting to hold for the long term to the downside. So it's completely variable depending on how long I expect to hold the trade. Sometimes I'll even go into 30 DTE. If it's something I'm expecting to hold for a week, maybe up to two weeks, but about a week, 30 DTE is fine because you're not holding it that long and by going deeper again in the money, you still limit your Theta decay.

So you got to figure out what's right for you there. Now let's talk about the rest of this structure. I just walked through all of the details essentially on thinking about the put that you might purchase for the short out of the money puts. These are secondary. So the primary profit mechanism, the driver of profit in this trade is the long puts. You cannot forget that. So when we're adding these short puts, they're designed to amplify the returns. They give us a little bit of premium upfront. They help us offset the cost of gamma or leverage depending on what delta you pick for your longs. These are designed simply to supplement the position. I bring that up because what you don't want is to try and get too greedy and collect too much money upfront via the short options and then cap or even worse, induce more risk if you get an accommodating move, which I'll show you what that looks like in a second.

So the short options, it's kind of the inverse thought process as the end of money options. I'm going to go less than 60 to E for short. The vast majority is going to be less than 40 even closer around 20 days maybe. They're going to be out of the money because I want them to decay as quickly as possible. Now there's some considerations around what strike price you pick. This strike price is selected via delta. This strike price is kind of baked off of this one. So we have to be thoughtful and it's not as simple as if we buy, let me grab this. It's not as simple as if we buy, let's say, this 57 and a half. It's not as simple as just saying, well, we sell something lower than that because the delta's matter actually quite a lot and we'll get a little further into detail on how to think about the delta's in the position. So if I go to a risk profile, just to show you what this thing could look like. Here we have the standard ratio, but diagonals. Let me give you another way so it's a little easier for you to see.

Let me give you another way so it's a little easier for you to see. You don't have to worry about all of these other boxes and stuff. This is actually the old positions that I had, but here's our base trade, the long puts. As you can tell, we have unlimited profit potential. We have cap downside risk and we suffer theta K. Then we can add short options on top of it. In this example, for the short options, I went out 31 days to expiration and I picked something that was like a 12 delta. Again, you can go closer to add the money and if we want to take a look at what an example of that might look like, if I grab five of these and throw them in, I'm sorry, the further out of the money ones. These ones. So this is essentially the difference between those two and it won't look like much on this. You need to actually look at the P and L of the open if we get in a accommodating move.

That's using the further out of the money puts. If we use the closer puts and we get that one standard deviation move, we get 79.80. So why is that? Well, because these are a higher delta, they're going to start chewing into your profit factor a little bit quicker because of the delta. So what's the trade off here? Well, if you go closer to the money, you're going to make a little bit more money up front. I'm getting 72 cents here as compared to 15 cents here. Again, that's the next threshold you have to cross when you're choosing what options to select. We know how to select the long option for the short option. Once you get your expiration, depending on what fits in with your portfolio, then you have to figure out which delta within there. And this is the first trade off. The trade off is the higher delta you pick for your short puts. You're going to collect more money up front, but you're going to give up more profit potential. You've got to find what works for you.

In this scenario, we're long 30 of these in the money puts and only short five. Why is that? Well, we're not going to collect a bunch of money up front. That's pretty clear. However, if we start adding more, let's say we do 10, you collect way more money up front. But then notice what happens to your PL if you get that one standard deviation down move. Now it's at 7,016 as compared to what you just saw at 7980. So this becomes an assessment of your conviction of the trade and how you want to produce returns. This is exactly the name of the game here.

Now, quick admin note. The reason why in this case with the 30 longs and the 30 shorts, it's the same, meaning there's no risk to the downside, which is where I would make profit, is because of the delta I picked. These are such a high delta they will cap out before these, but that will change as the long delta's move. So just an important note, the ratio is important to maintain. It might be a little bit misleading in the beginning of the trade because of something like that. If you're selecting your delta's really carefully. So, then comes the question, how many of them do you sell? It depends entirely on how much money you want to collect upfront, and then how much profit potential do you want to give up to collect that money upfront? Only you can answer that. For me, I typically would try to keep a few shorts on to offset some of the cost of time decay, but it is a secondary profit factor. Another thing is a lot of times the short option won't even go on at the same time as the long.

The way you simplify this entire strategy is if that happens, you buy to close the short puts, get rid of them, and then you sell to close the long puts the entire position. That's the simplest way to trade this, again, if you want to keep it super simple. Once you get your move, you close the shorts, close the longs, move on with your day. Now, quick, add me a note on that. More often than not, what I will do is sell maybe five of the longs first.

Now, the more complex scenario includes if your short options fall in the money, we don't want to just book a loss on the short options.

Let's say that the underlying, we get a big move in our favor and the underlying is now down at 50. Well, these 52 and a half are going to be showing a loss, because they will be worth more at this point. So if you close those, you're just going to eat that loss. And I don't like doing that because I also want to make sure that I'm not realizing losses and not realizing corresponding gains that then can go away and also be losses. That's a terrible scenario. So what that could look like to play that out is if O drops, it goes down here to again, 50, you're like, okay, this is moving big in my favor.

I want to get rid of the drag from the short options and just let it be all long options from here. Let me get rid of these. I'll buy them at a loss. It's okay because these are making a bunch of money. Okay, so then you do that. But then what happens if O just rallies back? Now the profit that you were using mentally to cover this loss is now gone. And now this can even turn to a loss. So whenever I'm adjusting in the money, short puts in this trade, I'm either going to be rolling them to defer the loss or I'm going to be selling long puts to cover that loss, which is important to track. And that actually leads into what this concept of a critical strike is. So this is again, a quick synopsis of what we just looked over. So I'm giving this for you kind of a general reference. We can skip over it. And I want to give you some important kind of formulas and stuff. Don't let this overwhelm you. You can take your time looking at it and you can even modify some of these. But I'm going to walk through what the critical strike is. What the long option basis is and what the short put lots are. Here we go.",

What the long option basis is and what the short put lots are. Here we go. The critical strike tracks the overall position so that we know where we can sell short puts against the longs without potentially locking in a loss. That's the purpose here. So at the beginning of the trade, you can sell pretty much anything at the money. But what happens is as the trade moves around, as these deltas move around, sometimes unfavorably, it changes where you can sell short options against the longs and not lock in a loss. Now the other cool part is depending on your platform and you don't want to do that math. You don't have to. The platform can do it. So in this case, our short put strike is 52 and a half. If we go to 52 and a half, we can clearly see that we have a profit there. Great. No problem. But you have to pay really close attention to that because there can be instances where if you're getting more and more aggressive with your short puts that you can lock in a loss and especially with my methodology of selling the longs to cover the shorts, that can absolutely lock in a losing position. So that's what this is",

You take the strike price, the stock price, sorry, stock price, less, the long option basis, minus the long option value, divide that by the long option delta. That essentially tells you where your critical strike, where you can start offering short options. Now to get over to this one to skip to this for a second, this tells us how many you can sell at the current delta. So essentially, if I input a delta here, this will populate a number for me. Now again, you don't even have to do this. You can just essentially assess based on what your preference is for PL, where you want to set your shorts up. Do you want to have five, 10, 15, 20? If you're doing anything in this trade, you've got to be able to buy more than one long option, at least two, so that you can at least maintain some sort of ratio, right?

This just makes sure that we're not selling too many shorts against the longs, that if we get a big move in our favor, that we can eventually start looking at a loss. And again, to show you what that looks like in the platform, if I start clicking this, essentially when there's up in this case, downside risk to the trade, I'm just doing way too many just to make it more apparent. But when there's risk in our profit favor, meaning down on the long puts, when there was risk in that direction, there's too many. That means that your short deltas can overwhelm your long deltas, leading to again, risk in that direction that I don't want. So that's what allows me to track that. And again, your platform can do it just like I'm doing it right there by clicking that button. No big deal. Next up, we have the adjusted long option basis. This is also really simple. When I'm looking at this, I want to make sure I know what the actual basis of the long option is, including the total cost of the trade. So what I do is I modify the total cost.

I like being able to phase into the trade if I get minor moves against me or if I get a big price accommodating factor in my favor. I like having some money to be able to add to the trade depending on my hypothesis. And this is what it looked like.

So when I entered on the 22nd of Jan, a few days went by it started breaking down and I started seeing this weight carrying it down. So when I saw that I could get out of those shorts for the cheap, right? The difference here is minimal. The overall debit paid 950. I lose 120 bucks, but this is a scenario where it's starting to break down. I want to let it break down and I don't want these shorts to get in the way. So in this case, I don't add more shorts to the position. I want to let it break down. And that's why I cleared these out earlier. Again, you don't have to do that. You can just let it run its course until you get to the",

You can just let it run its course until you get to the expiration of the options, but I'm very involved in the position personally. So at this point, the realized P and L for the position is negative 120 bucks. And then the long put unrealized P and L unrealized is 1200 bucks. This is important. So at this point, I'm eating 12 and I'm very carefully monitoring it. Now, if I was being by kind of the standard textbook or if this was a bigger loss that I just don't care about, I absolutely would have unwound some of these longs to cover the cost, the loss of this short. So in that scenario, I would say, okay, out of my 30, how many do I have to sell to make more than 120? That's how I would net that out. For me, this is a small enough loss that I just don't care. It didn't matter to me into the position. This didn't balloon enough. You'll see an example of those others in a second. So we fast forward time. Here is essentially day after and we see this candle.

Why did I wait even though it looked like it was starting to base is I wanted to see. So for example, if this started heavily trending sideways, I absolutely would have been okay with selling puts at that point, but it just started to break down. So I wanted to give it time to continue breaking down. So we fast forward. And again, those that let me take this away, you can see essentially how this trail down and then what it turned into from that point, which was pretty big update, but then it came back down. So overall, giving the trade as much room to move in my profit factor is the goal. So you can see now, what I'm doing is sliding down my stops. I'm following the trade down.

But I want to give it enough room to work, but I'm going to follow along with it pretty closely. So the way I would use these is by phasing out until I get to a hard cut point, because as I phase out, essentially what happens is I now have the ability to book a profit at a higher level at the lower stops and then a slightly lower level at the medium stops and all the way up. It allows the position to walk out of these some profit, even if I'm being stopped out on the way up. Now on the 16th of Feb, what I ended up doing was now selling to open 15 of the 15 March 50 puts. Why do you think I did that? Well, because it clearly started showing signs of strength. Take a look at the difference in these scenarios. In this case up here, it started showing a little bit of strength and then it fell off a cliff. Here we have one day, two day, three day, and then a big green upward candle on this fourth day.

So to me, this looks like it's starting to post some near term strength, which is exactly why on this candle specifically, I was willing to offer more of these short puts. So those brought in a credit of 6.75. I still had a realized loss of 120 from up here and then an unrealized PNL now of 8775. So here's the net on the trade. Next, we go to 8 March. So as you can see, this is where I sold those puts and you can see how the underlying behaved since I sold those puts. You can see where my stop is now, we are starting to get real, real close. So in this case, what I ended up doing was taking these puts down for a pretty big profit. I sold them for 45, took them in for 8 cents. So that gives me 555 bucks. That'll clear this loss out and put something in my pocket. And then the unrealized on the long options came down a little bit.

It's not much. But it was still enough with leverage to walk away with something on that money. Again, making 57 hundred bucks on 16 is not bad at all. So that's how that trade essentially played out. It popped up via a breakdown scan. I knew it was going to be a shorter term trade. And by selecting essentially the delta that I did, which was around is 75. It found a really good basis and the days to expiration on the original leg. You can see again, the out to 17 main from Jan. So I ended up going here for the sake of liquidity. Because when you're trading these kinds of things, you cannot forget about liquidity. All right, let's take a look at some of these questions. The first one from Don't Ask is how much time and effort do you put in thinking through the path of the trade about zero? It doesn't matter.

    "text": "questions. The first one from Don't Ask is how much time and effort do you put in thinking through the path of the trade about zero? It doesn't matter. I have a hypothesis when I enter the trade and then I am defining my profit and loss on entry based on my best guess. But the path it takes to get to either of those two points and don't really care about. I'm going to kind of see how it flows. Then this one is if your long option moves to at the money, meaning it's going in the wrong direction. And you honestly think you were just early. Do you reset it or ride it out? It's a moot point, right? Because again, the PNL is defined on entry. So this will be defined before I even enter. If it's at the stop, I get out. If it's not at the stop, I don't get out. Simple as that. Can you go too far out in time with the long option where the structure doesn't make sense? This supplies if you're using a really low delta. The reason why it applies if you're using a really low delta is if you go super far out in time and you have like a 10 delta, there's no gamma there either. So even if you get a big move, you're not going to see most of it. If you have a long in the money option with a high delta at",

If you have a long in the money option with a high delta at 90 plus 80 plus, you're going to see most of the move anyways. So it doesn't really matter. The next thing would be liquidity here. Situation where you would consider adding the kicker at any point during the trade between the short and long option. I think I covered that a little bit before. That's mostly just if I'm expecting some sort of big directional move in my favor. And I want to be able to compound more efficiently. Next question from a boy, Shreja, Shreja says, I think it pretty much covers it. Maybe you could highlight differences in management compared to a ratio called diagonal. Not much. I mean, it's obviously trading to the downside. So the way that you analyze downside moves might be slightly different. It is for me, a stock can really fall under its own weight as compared to what it needs to be supported up through these really voracious up moves. And the other thing is being mindful of the volatility interaction with the position, which is very different from a ratio called diagonal.

And as it started to trend back up and fall was bleeding out, it really took a lot of the PL out of the trade. So gotta be aware of those impacts, I think. Last one. Rik says, you talk about critical strike. Can you go more into that? I think that overall we covered that pretty far in depth here, actually. So I imagine we're probably good on that as well. So that's ratio put diagonals. And again, this honestly is kind of surface level. This is at a really, really high level. There's a ton to go into. Now, the last thing I do want to show you guys is a trade that I have on right now, which is in Roku. And the way that I found this trade was really simple. This popped up on a breakdown scan here. So I entered here. Original stop was at near term resistance, at least what I deemed it as. And then as I started getting a price accommodation, I start sliding it down, sliding it down.

And this is where it's at now. And again, today is the 18th of June. We'll see how it goes right now showing a profit, but not much. I haven't gotten a giant move yet, but I will follow it to the downside. I have inverted moving averages, nice and wide, negative price trend. It definitely fell out below this near term resistance. After we cracked below this kind of short term resistance, I front ran front ran the move just a little bit. And yeah, the main reason why I got in here versus here is because this was a big massive down day, a giant rejection at this level. So that to me was pretty bearish. And I was willing to play this move, even though I typically would have waited for a drop below here. I also looked back. This is really where there's way more support, right? There's one touch at this level. Over here, there's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, a ton of interactions with this level. So it was way more relevant to me anyways. So we'll follow this one all the way through. And right now, that's looking like long 15 of the 60s at 626, in short five of the 51s. And",
