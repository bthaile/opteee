We prefer to stay on discord, but the problem is that there are a prolific amount of scammers and from an admin level. It is a significant burden to try to continually scrape them out. It takes a ton of time and effort. So by moving over to the Patreon, we decrease the risk because they're not allowed. Nobody's allowed to DM one another. So it gets rid of that ability to scam people behind their backs trying to pretend to be people that whole thing. And for those that are wondering, there's still a completely free, several sections to the community. So there's literally no change there. It's just a slightly different change in terms of just where the community is and some of the built-in capabilities. Again, the Patreon capability isn't exactly what I would want long-term. My goal is to hibernate the discord and then when discord eventually fixes this problem, then I would love nothing more than to move us back. But until then, I just threw a link to the chat. You can sign up for free there again. That's one of my primary missions is to offer a space that I wish I had when I first started trading. And I fully acknowledge and understand that there are people that are newer in their path that just literally do not have the disposable income to pay for a community",

So the downside to that is with a community that's open to everybody, it's free for scammers and stuff like that to join in. It's a 100 return on investment, right? So it does have some of those unfortunate components tied to it. So when we get a solution and discord, we'll migrate back. But until then, we're just popping over. We're now operating out of the Patreon. And like I said, if you have any questions, let me know. It's still completely free to join. You can see that there's a handful of chats. There's still the beginner chat, the main chat, all that stuff is available to everybody. And we'll roll with the punches as they come. But wanted to give you that update, the discord itself for now will be effectively in hibernation. So what that means is no new members will join. We are going to remove all existing members so that it's kind of just a quiet space.

So if we take a look at SPX, I was actually trading zero DTEs today. And my entry time is favorable for stuff like this on days like today. We are on like the deep end of the range that I typically would want to enter before things start getting too hectic. The main reason for the entry today though was because the amount of premium collected really compensated genuinely for a decent bit of the risk as far as I assessed it. So I didn't mind it from that lens. But days like today are actually very difficult, I think, in general, because you can't see it coming.

It's funny because one day includes today and yesterday, it's not like today. But here is effectively where you saw the market start to sell off big. So we opened the day, we were hovering around like 5910 ish on the open. And then we rallied a bits and then all of a sudden here, 955, we start to see a pretty big sell off. Now what are the guesses out there? Who has any ideas as to what might be part of this sell off? Now there's a few things that I've heard. I was recently talking to a coaching client that was talking about the Moody's rating, thinking that's part of it, which is a good guess. But what do you think? Why did the market start selling off here? The reason why I'm asking you this is actually way less to see who has the right quote-unquote right answer. It doesn't really matter.

So the bond market the bond auctions are ongoing and funny enough most of the time people don't really hear or think much of them because they're just kind of going on and there's not much to it. However, always remember that there are a couple distinct time frames that we pay attention to as traders near term when we're talking about positioning. It's all about where the money is dollars and cents today right now. Where is it? So what happens is as people's perception of things change they position themselves differently positioning themselves differently means that we're taking money from some places and we're putting it in other places. So what you saw here was really important both from a geopolitical perspective but then also from a standard market perspective understanding how people are viewing debt and how they're positioning their money.

So for those that don't know there's different futures contracts that you can take a look at different duration bonds. So I'm going to throw a few of them up here for us eyeball. So we'll do that one. We'll do ZN. We'll do ZT. And then VIX is fine. We'll leave VIX up. What do you notice as we just generally look across the yield curve on the day? So we can see these are futures. So you have to use the candle before the after hours open which is this one. You have to use the candle before. So what do you notice? You notice that if you're taking a look at long term bonds right so if you're looking at ZB which is 30 year you can see that the 30 year fell pretty significantly yields obviously going up. And if you take a look at ZN you can see a similar story and then ZT. So what I'm going to do is actually use my box spread calculator tool because it also plots a yield curve which is. Copical for us right now. So I'm going to. Copy that really fast so that we can look at it together. I missed the pull on. Here we go. Okay.

So when we start to see softening demand that's something that you have to pay attention to you can't just look over that. And as always back to the point I was making earlier supply and demand is always the ultimate factor. It's always ultimately what matters. So what ended up happening here is during the auction we saw very very clearly weak demand for the debt. So then we have to see like okay based on that weak demand what what might it mean and where's the demand weak. We use a lot of longer term debt because it provides stability. So if you take a look at the long end of the curve you'll notice that's where more of the difference happened. But then you'll also see that there's some near term inversion even very very slight on something like 120. So these different periods which is four months by the way. These different periods are seeing really really very demand. So the market is now pretty spooked based on what happened earlier today and this goes back to a broader message I've shared a million times and I will happily share it for a million and first.

Lauren says UNH being investigated for medical or Medicaid fraud which doesn't surprise me at all. And that's going to be like a big ugly thing that likely will impact others within the industry that would be my expectation. So a healthcare likely will look pretty soft. Now that softness. Generally comes from near term positioning and expectations on where we think the market might go in the short term in the long term. These kinds of things typically bear themselves out but that's where an interesting opportunity lies for us as traders because they're very, very clearly is a gap between expected value and where we sit now because when you see things move as much as they have here, it's kind of like that same price dislocation we discussed earlier with respect to tariffs.

Now again, you have to take things for what they are. These are weekly candles. Doing H is effectively undone, five years of growth. That's this is a five year chart. So that's huge.

If things are as bad or worse than projected, then you absolutely can see this just get punished into the dirt. But until that point, it's up for grabs.

And then all of a sudden, when this next leg down occurs, the options markets absolutely explode with long put volume and short call volume.

But it's like the third biggest decline that you see. So the options market here is clearly showing their preference and where they're positioning. So let's take a look really quick and see what jumps out at us from a longer term positioning. A lot of near term volume. Man, take a look at this one day, one day, one day. And I mean, a decent amount of it is still being bought, which is short term expectations, really short term expectations. So it does look like from a super, super, super short term expectation. It does look like people are trying to play it marginally to the upside. Ah, take a look at that. That's actually kind of bullish. The fact that insiders stepped in that heavy when it's that low, that's actually kind of a good thing. It's surprising, but I do like to see that. The reason why that matters is because it does start to show that insiders are looking at the activity and saying it's getting beat down, but longer term, there's some sort of comfort to the upside, which, yeah, I mean, you kind of like to see it.

Let's take a look at percent changes here. A lot of heavy open interest in the front explorations. So definitely still very much playing these near term moves. There's two things that we can take away from this. And it's that there's clearly a near term expectation of downside. However, let's take a look at total, oh, I, here we go. This is what we want. It still leans bullish. So people are playing the recovery. And people are playing the recovery long term, right? You can take a look at these. And I mean, that's, you don't go out here unless you're expecting larger moves over time. Most of these look like, you know, like moving these out, rolling them. And then these look like positioning for the following month. What are these? 600 calls, 315s, sold net sold. To mix back, it looks like I don't see a clear, a clear trend other than some level of general bullish expectation. But it's spread all over the place.",

People are expecting big things from Google. And I mean, the net is pretty bullish. There's definitely some spots of puts that I see, but yeah, it's like pretty bullish. Near term is really, really bullish. Take a look at that. That's literally two days. What's the percent change on those? That's nuts. That's a really big change in the OI for really near term options like this. So that's expectation of near term price movement. Super interesting. Let's take a look. Yeah, so by volume, pretty strong call build out. Yeah, very, yeah, like very decisive to me, which is a little bit different. And you can see that the call side activity is just jacking in the near term. Cool. I'm going to pop the door for Thor and then we'll take a look at what you guys want.

So it's not something that I'm expecting any sort of like big massive movement out of regardless. But I do think 20 year, I think longer term bonds are definitely in a more tenuous position. I think it's a little more preferable to fade them to the downside for very near term ideas. But these are the kind of things that as they're going down, I absolutely try to leave breadcrumbs for signs of reversals. So things like just adding alerts at spots like here, right, where I start to think that it might be rallying up back through near term resistance because it's overall likely to occur. But the bond equity relationship has just gotten so abused, miscontorted. I mean, take a look at it, right? Like as we go out far enough, you can see that we're just at a point where bonds are getting crushed. So you can play the yield, but I think near term, I would expect bonds probably to struggle.

It's funny because I think RDDT was a really interesting one. I've traded it a few times. And it's because stuff like this with like IPOs and then just absolute mania around it. It's kind of a fun trade. But the reality is that Goldilocks period starts to fade off. So it's earnings. They came in at 13 cents. They were expected at two pennies. So objectively great earnings release. But then you notice this. Right? Like if they're so profitable, why would this happen? Well, it has to do with what they talked about in the actual earnings release and the expectations that people have around it. So let's take a look really quick. Reddit. Earnings release. I'm actually interested. I didn't look at their quarterly results. I traded them, but I didn't read them. So let's take a look at the actual release. They should have... No, no. Normally they have like an investor presentation that looks nicer than that. I don't want the PDF. Hold on. Reddit investor. These releases, quarterly results. No, it's the same thing. Yeah.

Complete financial results management commentary. Let's see what this is. Let's do the transcript. And then let's see what the video is. Hmm. I'll turn the sounds that you guys can listen to what it is. And by Gen Wong, our system. So short, we're at a strong start to our second year as a public company. And we are very grateful to be with you here today. Okay, we're going to go through the questions. Number one for me. How is user engagement with Reddit answers? How do you see it evolving over time? Okay, boring. All right. Let's see. This will just be faster than listening to them. I'm screening the questions right now because most of the questions suck. Here we go. See, this is an interesting question. Like, what do they consider other revenue? I had revenue and other other revenue consists from content licensing. I see. So it's growing because it's small.

Let's see if there's any just uh, that was on the first. So it closed at what? It closed at 116. Opened up super strong and then it closed at like 118. So what happened on the day? Let's see here. All right, positive revenue trend net margin, which is good return on equity, which is good. Yeah, so it's interesting because it's the case where like, there's nothing glaring at me. That looks like awful, but clearly the market didn't like it. So going back to the original question, though, on like oversold in time to sell puts, this is not where I would sell puts.

And then especially if it starts tick like flirting with these lows. So if this were me, I would be way more interested in some sort of volatility based neutral strategies. So like short strangle, something like that. Just because it looks generally range bound, right? Like I can see a pretty clearly defined range from like the 130 handle ish down to the 80 handle. So a big wide range. But if we take a look at what the options change shows us for that. So down to the 80 handles like 20 delta. So you could do something a little more aggressive like 85 handle, which is a 30 delta. And then to the upside, I mean, we see the near term peaks of that at like 128, which puts you way, way, way, way, way out of the money. So vol isn't quite as high out this far. So it looks like the expectation is that range is going to contract a little bit. But it looks super range bound to me. So that's the kind of thing where I might consider like a short",

So that's the kind of thing where I might consider like a short strangle and then roll the strangle as it moves, specifically trying to trail the rebalance it. But yeah, it's because it'll likely have some risk premium as it's going through here. It's early to tell right because 30 day risk premium will be negative. But future risk premium might might trend a little bit better. Robert Clark says, Bull has some pretty great premiums. I've had good luck with CSPs. Let's see. Bull. I mean, it looks awful. I can see the interest in selling premium because it has 120 IV. And it really does seem to have a pretty defined floor, which my guess is this will be baked into the options market. It does have earnings coming up. Let's take a look at what the options look like. Yeah. So you start to run out of liquidity below like the 11 handle. But I mean, it has a decent floor baked in, right? Since it's already so cheap. Yeah. And it has earnings on the 20 seconds.

So if we take a look, we can see that I mean, literally for an 11 strike, which is a 27 Delta, you're getting like 90 cents. That's crazy. For those that don't know, one of the ways that you can kind of ballpark what this whole thing looks like, I'll literally show you. So let's take what is this the 11s. And then let's do what's the premium. Let's call it like 90 cents. You literally can build like a little calculator for yourself. So here we'll have strike, we'll have premium. We'll have have X-PRI. So the X-PRI on these is 20 June. And then we could do like lot size. So it just doesn't really matter what the lot size is for the sake of this conversation. But so then let's do some basic math. So the first one is let's say you're doing a cash secured, which it's just a good comparison to use cash secured versus something like margin. But you don't have to, right? You could put whatever the margin requirement is this, we could just easily calculate the cash secured amount, which is just your strike times lot times one Hyundai, step-by-fuck something",

You could put whatever the margin requirement is this, we could just easily calculate the cash secured amount, which is just your strike times lot times one Hyundai, step-by-fuck something up. So strike times your lot times multiplier, which is 100. So it'll tell you obviously how much you need in order to secure the position. Then we can calculate days to expiration from whenever the entry was. So today is 21 May. Days to expiration, X-PRI minus entry, 30 days. You can calculate the premium. In this case, the credit collected or the, I guess you still would say that credit. How would you say this? CREDT. CREDT. Feel like even though it's misspelled, you still get to the same spot. That's kind of cool. And credit here is your premium times lot times 100. Then you can calculate what your relic is. Relic is simply the credit you get divided by how much money you have to put up. So in this case, you're making 8.2 and again, this is a 30-day trade. So then you can annualize your return. You can either do trading days or actual calendar days. So then you can literally have your output of what the annualized return is. Which is, I mean, I think pretty impressive.

So 8.2 over the course of a month is really good. However, there's obviously risk, but this clearly has a floor baked in. So for a developed account, this is not where I would go, but for a small account, I totally get it. The other thing that might be considered is even selling like a call spread. With this recent squeeze up to 80, I wouldn't want to necessarily hold naked short calls because getting a sign during one of those can be kind of annoying. But yeah, definitely there's a lot of premium here. The thing I like more about this compared to other things that I've seen is if there's really high premium, but you're not near a perceived floor, that becomes more problematic. But again, like let's say that you do get this for 90 cents, you can literally size your trade so that you're considering it going to zero, right? And that's obviously hyper conservative. It's not what I would do, but what I mean is to give you like a reference on how you can conceptualize something that's as volatile as this. But there's a million things you would do before",

It's not what I would do, but what I mean is to give you like a reference on how you can conceptualize something that's as volatile as this. But there's a million things you would do before it got to zero. So it's the kind of thing where like if it starts falling well below where you think support is, you can either always close your trade, you can open up puts by the puts at that point that are further out at the time of entry, you could buy really, really cheap wings for something like this. If I had a small account, that's exactly what I would do because you can get super cheap wings way out here, right? So down at the five, you can grab them for a nickel, right? So then you take your credit received down to 87 from 92. And then if we take a look at the risk profile compared to the naked put compared to the spread here, you can see that you're capping your risk at half of what it would be if it went to zero, you're not really taking that much off the profit side, right? Like you're literally losing three cents from 92. That's a trivial expense. This is an example where I think a spread makes a ton of sense. This is a really good application for a vertical spread.

I don't know if it has it reported earnings before, it doesn't look like it, but I don't know what their last earnings look like. Was this from earnings? No, it wasn't. All right. Lauren says I have a few calls and sq's I could afford q puts. So sq's is fine. I'm always curious what leads you into calls and sq's versus either using tq's or just q's for your idea.

So then what led you to sq's versus tq's? Affordability. Okay. I get it. The other thing to pay attention to that I'm asking the question because it's a good general lesson for people is let's take a look at a comparative position because it's I think a pretty good example. So if we look at sq's and let's say that we wanted to get short tech, let's say that you want to buy in at the money call that is 50 delta 30 days out, just grabbing an example. The volume is 69.9, or 69.8. So pretty high volume. Let's track that here. So this is 30 DTE. We're looking at 50 delta on the nose and our vol is 69.82. And what is the premium for the call mid point 174? Let's call it 175. So here we have delta here. We have vol here. We have premium. Okay. So this is example one. This is using sq's. Now let's take a look at tq's. And I want to show you how to compare the relative cost of a similar size position, which we are going to have to cost or price adjust. So this is 2456. The reason why the 2456 matters is because we're going to have to normalize the delta's a little bit. So this",

The reason why the 2456 matters is because we're going to have to normalize the delta's a little bit. So this will be ticker. And then this will be price, spot price. So what we can do is we can normalize whatever our delta's are against the spot price. Right. So what I mean by that is if we take a one lot, we can say your delta's here, your 50 delta's on something that's 25 bucks. And this is literally just to normalize it. You can also divide it. This doesn't matter literally at all. All that matters here is that you have something that's made relative to the price. So now let's take a look at tq's. And there's an example you'll see here in a second. So let's take a look at the same 50 delta's that puts you at the 70. So spot price and tq's is 6794. Delta is 0.51. So you're getting a little bit more. Volatility on these is 64.75. It looks like 0.74. So we'll call it 64.7 premium 5.85 size one. So you can figure out what your same size delta's are.

Right about right. So then what we can do is we can figure out the comparative cost relative to the delta's that we're getting. So all I would do, again, it doesn't matter what you do, as long as you standardize it to give yourself effectively a ratio to figure out how expensive the delta's are. So the interesting thing here is that I need to adjust the price. So for the, what do we do? The 19 delta's, these are 1.67. So you can see these are actually cheaper, even though you're paying for puts, even though you're paying for puts, you know, this doesn't, this doesn't take into account.

Skyshadex says, but does it consider spreads and liquidity? I find those leverage ETFs have insanely large spreads so much that it's almost easier to just trade the underlying. Not so much. They're absolutely going to be wider, but in terms of like getting the total exposure, what you pay on the spread is still probably cheaper than putting on the same size position in the underlying ETF. So we'll look at an example before I pop off. So Skyshadex, do we want to look at an example of being long the leverage ETF? Or do we want to look at being short the leverage ETF? I just want to create effectively the same position between them. We'll just use TQs and Qs. And I'll build, I'll start building like a little track or based on which scenario we want to look at.

And in order to make this same same, we take the bid ask spread divided by the strike price. So we can figure out what it is relative. So this is super, super tight on a relative basis. That tightness is difficult to track because sometimes people look at it as a gross metric, which is a big mistake. It's very, very different and you have to look at it differently. So now, let's use the 10,000 account. Let's say that we're trying to get a 10,000 allocation. So we can literally figure out lots required. Lots size required for this. All we do is we take our 10,000, we take our 10,000, we divide it by our strike price. We're going to have to go up and money. I'm going to make it like a 50,000 account. Something like that. This is because you can't even cash secure one of these. So anyways, we want that divided by that times 100. And then we can essentially figure out what lot size we need. So here, make this just a number. And let's make this 50,000. So you essentially need a one lot. So now, what we can do is we can figure out what our total exposure is with respect to deltas. So what this means is I know",

So now, what we can do is we can figure out what our total exposure is with respect to deltas. So what this means is I know that this provides one times leverage. So this will be leverage. So this is one times, this is three times. So there's really nothing to be done here, right? Your deltas are what they are. So your total underlying base deltas that you have in this are literally this. Size times delta times 100 times your leverage factor, which is one. So you're getting 30 underlying deltas. Simple. Okay, so now let's take a look at TQs. We'll fill the same thing in. I'm going to leave it off to the side just so that I can fill it in faster. 6794. Strike price, we need 30 delta. We don't really need a 30 delta. I'm picking a 30 delta here to create an equivalent, but you'll see what I mean in a moment. So strike price is 63. Delta is also 30 on the nose, which is nice. 2.73. 3.05. Okay. So now there's an important change that happens here. So this one needs to be locked. So if we want to use 50,000, we can figure out how to use 50,000. In this case, you effectively need seven. However, if we take a look at the like comparison",

In this case, you effectively need seven. However, if we take a look at the like comparison deltas, it's actually a completely different story because if we take a look at notional value, our notional value is simply our deltas times current price. This is our notional value. So this has a massively wider spread, literally 0.51. Huge comparative spread. However, what we can sort out is what are the total deltas that these provide. So this is using the underlying price. However, there's a leverage factor that needs to be applied to this. So you can see even though you have a wider bit as spread, you're literally getting more exposure for the same position. When you're trading a small account, it doesn't really matter because you're trading one lot where this becomes relevant is when you're trading a big account. And you're having to put on larger positions. So let's say instead that this was 250,000 allocation. And let's say that you wanted to use 250,000. Well, in order to put on the 250,000 position, we can see what we would need here. We need a five lot. So if we throw the five lot on, we need more than that. Why hold on, my math's fucked up.

You have to put on a bigger position with a bitter, big ass spread. So then you might be saying, well, this seems more efficient. Well, here's the thing. In this one, you're sitting on way more cash. You're sitting on 167,000 of cash. So if you put this into something that gives you the risk-free rate, you can absolutely make more money than you lose on the comparative spread. That's the idea.

Again, depending on what the strategy is, because if you're doing things that are shorter term, you can consistently use less money.
