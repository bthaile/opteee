    "text": "People say all the time before you enter a trade, you have to have a plan. But how do you balance having a plan with managing current market conditions and figuring out what makes the most sense? Well, what that means is we're not really at a point as retail traders where we can be systematic. Systematic or mechanical trading, it sounds great. Why wouldn't we want to remove ourselves from the decision process and automate things? It sounds beautiful. The problem is, it doesn't work. We don't have the same structural capabilities that institutions do to actually follow truly rules based approach. However, what we can do is create a plan where we have a series of decisions that we apply based on current market analysis. That's how we can balance this line between having a plan but remaining flexible to current market conditions. Every single trade needs to have a profit target, lost target, and be time bound to be an outlier seal later.",
