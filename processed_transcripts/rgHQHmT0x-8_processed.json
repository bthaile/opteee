    "text": "How do you know when you've got it dialed in as a trader? It's a question and it's kind of funny because if you have to ask the question, you know it's not that point. But the way you know you have it dialed in is when you start to have a sense of what's going to happen before it happens. That does not mean you're predicting accurately what's happening in the market. The market will always throw you curveballs. I'm talking specifically when you're putting on trades. If you're putting on a trade and you already know if this works, this is what it will look like. If it loses, this is what it will look like. And if you're able to start doing that consistently, you start to build a repeatable scalable process because we now understand what's likely to happen and then we can create an expected return calculation around that and make sure what we're doing makes money long term. I'll see you later.",
