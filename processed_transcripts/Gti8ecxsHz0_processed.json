    "text": "Hey everybody, as promised I have another video comparing the VIX to the VXX. Volatility is awesome, they're products that I really enjoy, they're very nuanced. I'm actually talking with one of my friends right now who spend a lot of time learning about volatility so I'm hoping to have him come on and talk to us a little bit about what he's learned, bring some of his experience to the table as well because I absolutely respect his opinion on this stuff but to kind of prep us for that conversation and settle up on a couple basic, similar similarities and differences between the two, I figure this is a good place to start. So first we have the VIX and then the VXX, they are different, they are similar but they are different. Let's start with the similarities and then I'll branch into the differences. So both of them have options available to trade on them, they both track in some capacity, the volatility of the SP 500, they both are mean reverting and they both find expansion with heightened volatility and then they both tend to fall with lower volatility and another thing that's not on here but it's just the velocity of movement. If I pull one up just for general context, let's do the VIX, I'm going to zoom out a little bit, this chart's a little close. So you can see it went from essentially 14 to 85, that is a parabolic style move",

So you can see it went from essentially 14 to 85, that is a parabolic style move and both of these products will have movements like that due to their structure. They rise and fall rapidly with changes in volatility. So now let's shift over to the VIX, some trade that are specific to the VIX. The VIX has no underlying, so what that means is there's no stock, you can't trade the VIX itself and I can show you this because if I pull up the VIX, there are options but notice how there's no bid, there's no ask, there's no size, there's no volume. There's no underlying here. The only thing the VIX does is track the SP 500 in 5 volatility and we can check that out pretty easily because, so right now the VIX is at 28.22, so if I type in the SPX and then I go to its volatility, we see 28.13. So it tracks the SP 500 in this instance, the SPX volatility. It does have VRO settlement on one base which is a little bit different than most options and ETFs, ETN stuff like that. So not really, I truly impact the one but one that's good to know. So then if I move over to the VIX, unlike",

So if I pull this up, we can see that there's a bid, there's an ask, there's a size, there's volume, there's all these components of an ETF, an ETN. The difference between that is the fact that part of your strategy depending on your disposition towards it, you can include holding an underlying. Now VIX is a forward looking projection of the VIX. So VIX, VIX, the VIX tracks the current SP 500 volatility. VIX is a forward looking projection of VIX. Like a lot of other ETNs that we see, it's a futures-based product. So that means that it's in a portfolio that uses futures to track the price of the VIX. So it uses forward slash VIX futures. And what that means is it's very susceptible to drag. The reason being is that means every single month it'll look at two different futures. So I can actually show you. So if I pull up the VIX. We can see that there's the front month, which is the closest to expiration contract. And then it uses the next month. So the following expiration. And as you'll see, there's",

And then it uses the next month. So the following expiration. And as you'll see, there's the difference in price here. So right now we actually see a little bit of backwardation where the further out futures are a little bit cheaper than the current futures. So there's no drag here. However, if these are switched, which they typically will be because we are generally in a state of contango, which is where the further dated futures contracts will be priced more expensively like these. So what will happen when we're in contango is when we get the expiration, we have to close out this front month, pay whatever it is to close. And then we have to establish a new position in the further out month. So if you can see the difference here in this exact scenario with the VIX, we would have the portfolio will have these May 20 futures. And then it'll also have this first expiration for June 20 futures. So as soon as it's time to roll these May 20 out, we have to buy the next June expiration, which we're trading for 31.25. So if we're going to close our current position at 29.95 and then establish a new one buying at 31.25, you can see we're paying more",

So if we're going to close our current position at 29.95 and then establish a new one buying at 31.25, you can see we're paying more than what we're getting over time that erodes the value of the product. So that's why you'll see reverse splits and stuff like that over time to keep the product in existence, essentially. The VIX, because it's an ETN, it settles Friday. So normal sentiment there. And then something else that is of no is that the VIX tends to have slightly lower volatility than the VIX. And the reason for that is because if we're talking about the same delta option. And the reason for that is because the VIX is made up of both front month and the following month futures. So there's a little bit of a buffer decreasing some of the typical gamma risk and things like that. And it's specifically Vega risk in this instance, which is changes to apply volatility. So VIX has a little bit of a dampened sensation for that due to being spread across two different expressions. So I like to trade the VIX personally. It's got really good volatility. It does suffer from decay. So you've got to make sure you plan that into your strategy. I would never, ever, ever just be long shares of VIX for any period",

I would never, ever, ever just be long shares of VIX for any period of time simply because if you sit there and you hold it while you're waiting for some sort of big pop and volatility, a lot of people try to do that. Well, if it goes from 13 up to 78, that's a ton of money you can make. It's absolutely true. And if you time it right, there's no doubt you would do well. But the problem is, is you can find yourself holding it for extended periods of time every single month, every month, really every week when we're rolling. You'll just see those options or the futures rolling out, causing decay, eroding the value of the position. So realistically, you're paying for it. You're not really having any sort of free lunch there just waiting for this big pop to happen. And then this is also the same exact reason why I always caution people against being short any sort of volatility product without coverage, meaning of spread. I like to sell calls, right? If I'm bearish, I think something's going to come down. And we know that this is a mean-reverting product. So you would better believe that when I see VIX at certain levels, I immediately",

And we know that this is a mean-reverting product. So you would better believe that when I see VIX at certain levels, I immediately take short positions in it. But it's always a short credit spread. So I sell and buy. And the reason is because of these binary movements, these huge movements can really hurt an account. Even though you'll know it'll come down at some point in time, if you're counting a margin call and you can't successfully add enough money to meet the margin requirement, they're going to force you to neutralize it at a bad time. So you're going to have to close those positions at a bad loss. So I just don't want to expose myself to any of that whatsoever. So I am always interested in shorting, stuff like the VIX and the VIX, when I see them at certain levels, certain highs. And that's great. However, always, always, always highly recommend keeping some sort of coverage to the upside risk because those binary moves can really, like I said, cause a tremendous change in your buying power requirement or your margin requirement. So that's kind of the big difference between the VIX, VIX in terms of the structure, how we can trade them. I absolutely, like I said, prefer the VIX. I find that the liquidity is",

And I like that there is an underlying involved. And I can also count on the decay or the drag over time, one more in contango, and I can see when that's going to happen and really increase the likelihood of it returning to a mean. So I can use some of those components to help inform my strategy and decision making. So if you have any questions on either of these, let me know. Great products to add to your toolkit. There are some nuances that you got to be mindful of, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't trade them. All right. I'll see you guys later.",
