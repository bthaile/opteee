    "text": "everybody as promised I have another video comparing the VIX to the VXX volatility is awesome their products that I really enjoy they're very nuanced I'm actually talking with one of my friends right now who spent a lot of time learning about volatility so I'm hoping to have him come on and talk to us a little bit about what he's learned bring some of his experience to the table as well because I absolutely respect his opinion on on this stuff but to kind of prep us for that conversation and settle up on a couple you know basic I don't know similarly similarities and differences between the two I figure this is a good place to start so first we have the VIX and then the VXX they are different they are similar but they are different let's start with the similarities and then I'll branch into the differences so both of them have options available to trade on them they both track in some capacity the volatility of the sp500 they both are mean reverting and they both find expansion with heightened volatility and then they both you know tend to fall with lower volatility and another thing that's not on here but is just velocity of movement if I pull one up just for general context let's do the VIX I'm going to zoom out a little bit this church will close so you can see it went from you know essentially 14 dollars to",
