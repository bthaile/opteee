I think we got most of the details done here. I think I just finished going through the formulas and I think that's all that's all that's here. Also, I have to be honest, there's like a really good chance my shirt is going to come off just because it's hot in my office. I'm trying to maintain decorum, but I literally don't have anything else in here. I don't have like a tank top. So this shirt might be coming off. It's windows are already open. So we'll see how it goes. But right now I am slowly starting to heat up. Okay. So we've learned where I'm says outlier after dark.

So I'd rather just sit here without a shirt on sweating. And that's how I spent actually a lot of the early videos. So let's see, maybe if I talk quiet, calm down, maybe I can get body temperature to lower. Maybe that'll happen. Okay. All the joking aside, let's get back over to this. And my game plan right now actually is to start with this. I think we should give it a test run. So we built this specific tracker, the profit mechanism tracker. And we want to see how it works. So I think we should essentially test it together. Now a couple notes with something like this, I, the reason why I like testing it sooner rather than later is because it'll help us identify if this layout makes sense. If the flow makes sense, if the format is what we want it to be, those kinds of things, right? So this is still in its infancy. So I suggest that we test it.

Siri pick a random month. Nothing. No, I don't want you to schedule. Jim, it's literally so much more difficult than I thought it would be. Pick a random month. Let's do October. And then everybody in the chat type in everybody in the chat type in a date. I'm going to go grab a tank top in the meantime. All right. All right. I know that there's ladies in the chat, so I don't like fucking strip and top with them here. If it was all dudes like it normally is I wouldn't possibly, I couldn't possibly care less.

Well, why did I pick this? Why pass bias? That's 100 correct, right? So last night we spent a while talking about the need for a trade log and we talked about human bias. And we actually talked about we did a couple exercises together that even further elucidated human bias. So by having you guys pick random days, meaning numbers, and then by applying random math to it, right, just addition subtraction, it backs me into something that I cannot pick this, right? It's it is generally random. It's not purely random. It's generally random. So what I want to do now is go to 25 October 2012. One of the stocks we are going to look at is going to be Microsoft.

That's the primary profit mechanism. So when we're looking at something like drift, we're going to bound this to where we think something is going to go over the next month. Drift can be longer than that. The reason why I'm just picking a I'm picking a time frame. Otherwise, you have to give the game some some bounds. Otherwise, it's very difficult to actually start the process. So I'm literally just picking something. So here's what we're going to do. We're going to look at Microsoft. We're going to look at let's call it five other stocks. And we're going to estimate price next month. So 30 day window from 25 October is what we're going to do. So let us buckle up.

What the fuck am I thinking of trading view? That's it. We're going to use trading view. Okay, perfect. Wait. Fuck, we can't use trading view. Never mind. We have to use think or swim. Never mind.

You literally don't need any of it. You can use the moving averages. Those are pretty common. You have volume down here. You can use the volume profile if you'd like.

I'll bring us out to a year chart. We'll do a year six months, three months. So here's your year chart. And then in the meantime, let me prep the poll. And again, this is going to be over the next month. Reese says what's the question? The question is we're doing an exercise. Pay attention. The exercise is to estimate if we think Microsoft is going to be higher or lower in the next month. I don't even care about a price target yet. I don't care about this at all.

The profit mechanism, I'm just going to move it here to price direction. I don't care. In this case, up or down, we're going to determine that here. So entry date is 19, oct, well. Here's Microsoft. The price of the ticker right now is 28, 58. The two signals that we had talked about is distance off of 52 week highs and three moving averages. So for determining price direction and drift, we can decide what signals we want to test. But first, my recommendation is we literally go through a handful of repetitions of not even worrying about signals, literally just up or down. And then I'll explain why the main reason is people can get too gummed up on this step of trying to figure out the perfect technical analysis details and that kind of stuff.

So then we can codify them in a little bit. Right now, it's literally just an up down estimation. That's all. And then we will start to build this up a little bit more over time. But that's the specific reason why I don't think it's important enough for people to get too gummed up on those details and then to not do the thing because that's what happens. These people get too stuck on details and then they're essentially they're dead in the water when it's a complete misuse of time and effort. So that is my stance here. Okay, so it looks like we have our estimations. And right now I see 62 down, 38 up. I'll end the poll there. So then the target here is down based on consensus. I would agree with that. I think target down is fine. One month. Again, don't worry about entry notes. Oops. So now we just fast forward a month. But before we do that, let's pick another series of random stocks.

Sort of Yikes right like still 50 50 right. That kind of bears out doesn't it? Tommy says broad market downturn indeed. Never really know when one of those are going to come down the pike. So right now I'm waiting for somebody to give me the formula for O 12. You know guess is so far. Reses this part takes me forever. Yeah, I mean, you could use chat GPT. So let's work through it together then if folks are uncomfortable here. We're just going to use a basic condition. So we would do something like here you go equals L minus E divided by E times 100. The problem with that is again, we're trying I want the P and L to show based on if we're correct here.

So Liz, what what did you ask chat GPT? And I'll show you what you should ask chat GPT next. And in the meantime, what is the Google she formula for calculating a profit and loss from an entry price sell E X price sell L. So I see why it's doing that. And it's doing it as a percentage as well. And that's just because we gave we gave GPT a very wide open answer. So first let me show you how I would calculate it. And then I would show I'll show Liz how to ask the question. So here literally all we're going to do is start with an if statement. And then it's going to be conditional off of H. So we can start with if H 12. And this way we can drag it down. I like to put spaces in between things so that it's easier for me to look at it. You absolutely do not have to do that.

Before you do anything here in O 12, I want you to look in H 12 and see what it is. In this case, I want it to check if it is up. If it's up, I'm going to tell it to do one thing. If it's down, I'm going to tell it to do another thing. And it's automatically going to take anything that is not up and apply that second formula. That's important to know because if you added a third thing in here that said like sideways, you can do that. But then you need to do nested if statements. So if in this case, H 12 is up, do this. If H 12 is down, do this. If H 12 is sideways, do this. You would have to nest the if statements. So in this case, this is what I would call a dumb formula. Yes, Amazon at my house. This is what I call a dumb formula. And I actually don't like using dumb formulas. The reason why I don't like using dumb formulas is because they're dumb.

So then we can say if. This equals down. Now I wanted to reverse this. I wanted to essentially give me the output if we had gotten in here. And then we get out cheaper here. So then I can close this first one. Close the second one. And then there's my math. Any questions on what we just looked at here.

I'm trying to type in. Tommy says using Excel need a formula to calculate profit and loss based on the cell that has up or down. This was my prompt. Yeah, you can do it exactly that way. If you want again, like a generalized response. There's a what I would consider to be something a little more accurate. Something like this. I'm giving it specific instructions. I'm saying in O 12, I want to calculate based on whether H 12 is up or down. And then if up, I wanted to do that. If down, I want it to do that. And that will probably return me a dumb formula. That's my guess. So then if it returns me a dumb formula, I would then clarify. And I would say use nested if for each possibility in H 12. So let's give it a whirl. Let's see what chat GPT.

So this is close enough. Essentially, this is what we have up to here. And then what it's doing is adding another if on top of that. You can kill that second if just close the parentheses and then you're done. So that's exactly what I would do. William warm says I'm following along, but I'm using my program or brain. I mean, realistically Python script is not easier than Excel. So I that would literally blow my mind if you were more comfortable with Python script than Excel. Because Excel is literally it's. A very simple representation. Anyways, back over to this. Let's complete our math. So this will equal. We'll do our P and L. Oops. I'm messing it all up. I'm just doing essentially one value here.
