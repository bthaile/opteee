Thank you. Appreciate it. So we were talking just a little bit about some of the things that you've been working on and some of, you know, what you're dealing with your channel and whatnot, potentially opening up the lens a little bit. Do you want to share a little bit about that? Yeah, so I recently did a video called I need your help and I basically just talked, I made a video just asking my audience, you know, what they thought of expanding the focus of the channel. I do stuff that's a little bit broader than options because for the past five years, my YouTube channel was strictly about options trading. But over the years, my personal philosophy has changed and I've learned a lot myself about all these other ways to manage your money and invest. I just wanted to kind of branch out and start talking about some of those things, but not necessarily a hard shift away from options, just, you know, still doing the option stuff, but having the opportunity to make videos here and there about other things. So I got pretty overwhelming responses and pretty much everyone was on board with talking about other stuff and I kind of had validation already from that",

So it tells you your audience watches these videos, your audience watches these channels. And so my audience was already watching, you know, stuff that I would want to talk about. So broader financial topics, mostly within the investing niche, maybe some, some personal finance stuff here and there, but it all kind of ties together. But yeah, I decided to just go ahead and broaden the scope. So rebranding from project option to project finance. And like I said, there will still be lots of options focused content and I'll still be doing live streams, which will be options focused since I'll, you know, be sitting there with my trading platform open, talking about positions I have on. Right. And yeah, so still going to be a lot of option stuff, just, you know, going to start sprinkling other topics in that have been exciting me and that I definitely want to make videos on just to, you know, help spread the word.

But as I know, if you, if you build an audience once on YouTube and you have the audience on one channel and it's still similar content, then it doesn't really make sense to make a second channel because you'll get way less views on those videos and then, you know, it's just not as efficient. So. And from a focus perspective to it's really hard for me to focus on two different projects at once. So I'm really happy that everyone was on board with broadening the scope and just keeping it all on one channel. So long as there are playlists separating it all so people can navigate and find everything easily. So yeah, that's awesome to hear. Honestly, just because I think one of like the things I have found most valuable. Same as you I'm 30 kind of going through a similar series of learnings and a big thing that I've started picking up is just the value of looking at other business ventures and it can be as simple as like we were just talking about like if you wanted to trade and then maybe have some interest rates or something like something really",

So it's helpful to find other things to start looking at and include into your overall I like to call it just an overall wealth portfolio. So I'm actually really excited to see some of the stuff that you talk about it's something that I think especially digging into things like real estate. So there's a ton of really really great information out there for traders that might want to be dabble on stuff like that. So I think yeah, I think it's really cool that you're kind of opening that that band a little bit and then the other really neat thing I think people get out of that is they get to go along that experience with you right and kind of see the stuff that you're currently interested in why you're interested in it.

Yeah, that's really good to hear. So we were actually just kind of, you know, having a conversation and I shared a little bit of what we were discussing and it pertains to kind of like the current markets and how things are currently situated what we're seeing as traders and investors. So one of those things that we were talking about was some issues or really just a change of paradigm really as it pertains to returns on risk reinvestments or lower risk investments stuff like that and you were sharing your perspective on that.

So I'm working on a video right now that should be out this week. So this is the week of the 26th. So yeah, this video will be out this week, but the premise of the video is talking about how this is a tricky investment environment for investors because typically you have different choices of investment products with lower risk, lower returns to higher risk higher returns. It would be something like a cash position would typically be your safest position. Savings account would be basically cash, but it's still it's earning you a little bit of return. And then you have government bonds or different types of bonds, it could be corporate bonds. And then you go to the higher risk spectrum, which is stocks, maybe real estate, you could consider higher risk. And then you have stuff right now in the new age world like cryptocurrencies, including you know Bitcoin, Ethereum or dogecoin if you're so inclined. And the interesting thing is right now on the lower the lower end of the risk spectrum, you actually you can't get positive real returns. So for those who may not know real returns are when you take the return of something and then you",

So for those who may not know real returns are when you take the return of something and then you subtract inflation. So if inflation is 2, excuse me, if inflation is 2 and you earn 3, then you're said to have a positive real return of 1. And if inflation is 2, and you earn 0, so like if you have a cash position that earn 0, but if inflation is 2, you have a negative real return because your dollars have actually lost purchasing power. So your dollars next year, if prices go up, which is inflation, then your dollars that didn't grow at all can buy fewer things. And so that would mean you have a negative real return. So it's it's a tricky environment right now because wealth friend actually dissent me an email the other day and they said we're dropping the interest rate on your high yield cash account from 0.35 to 0.1. So if you have 10,000 in a wealth front cash account, then you're going to earn nothing, you're going to earn like 10 bucks a year, which is, you know, and if inflation, as I said, if inflation is expected to be 2, which has kind of been the Federal Reserve's target, that's the higher end of their target. But inflation",

But inflation is 2, and you earn 0.1 in your cash account, where your savings account, then it's the same problem I discussed before where you have a negative real return where prices are rising faster than that investment position. And you see the same thing if you look at a 10 year bond to the 10 year bond yield is less than 2, the 30 year bond yield is just over 2, but the thing is if the 30 year bond yield is at 2.2 and inflation is expected to be 2, or that's the target, then you're barely, you know, you're barely keeping up with inflation in that position. But right now we are kind of in uncharted territories because we have never seen so much money printing in the history of, you know, of our country. So if you look at the chart of the money supply, it's literally like it's a straight up line over the past year and naturally if you create more units of something it dilutes the value of each unit that currently exists.

And so I think if you're an investor and you're looking at a 30 year bond, which has a 2 and a quarter percent yield and you're expecting inflation to potentially go higher than 2. And then you're not going to comfortably put your money into that position because number one, you're getting paid your coupon payments back in US dollars. And then at the end of that 30 year term, you're getting your principal back in US dollars. And if you don't trust that the US dollar is going to hold its purchasing power, then you're not going to comfortably put your money into that position. And so with the lower the lower end of the risk spectrum basically off the table in terms of getting positive returns on your investments, you have to look to higher risk assets such as stocks, we could say real estate's in there. Cryptocurrencies or something like art, if you know you're you're savvy and you know how to invest in art, but you basically are forced into these higher risk assets. And so",

And so I think that's partially a function of people not having any return potential in the lower risk assets. And so I think that's the most end of the higher risk assets, which is causing the prices to increase. And the same thing with the real estate market, I was looking up some data today and from January 2019 to January 2020, based on the housing index that I was looking at. And so what is the price index increased like 6 from January 2019 to January 2020 from January 2020 to January 2021, that same index has increased 12.

And so I think there's just there's a ton of demand to get out of cash and any cash denominated investment product like I described earlier with you pushing up asset valuations across the board on the higher end of the risk spectrum. So getting back to what I think about markets, I'm actually bullish on the stock market. I'm actually bullish on pretty much everything that's not cash based on the monetary policy that we're seeing. I think for as long as we have as long as we have the money supply increasing as quickly as it is and rates are extremely low like mortgage rates are at historic lows. And you know loans, you could take out loans and you can buy that house. The payments on that debt are so low and it's actually a strategic thing to take out debt. Right.

For those who don't know, Venezuela saw a hyperinflation where you know their currency basically it loses 90 of its value every few months essentially. It was crippling. Yeah. That's that's what happens in a hyperinflationary environment because people lose faith in the currency. And if that's the case, then people aren't going to accept that currency as payment or they're going to accept way higher units of that currency. Right. But anyways, I don't want to be a doomsayer. So I think that hyperinflation or Venezuela type event is coming for the US. But I think that right now based on the monetary policy, it is creating rapid increases in all these asset prices. So as long as we have a monetary policy like we do right now, then I am bullish on high risk positions some bullish on stocks. So what are some changes in monetary policy that would make you change your thoughts.

We would we would see higher interest rates because of that too because there be less money and circulation. But yeah, I don't I don't know if we're going to see that at least in the next few years. It seems it's I'm glad you bring that up honestly because that like that's the one thing I've been telling people that I'm just watching like a hawk whenever I see any of the Fed talking about money is to see how they're talking about printing money everybody's curious about interest rates and stuff rightfully so. But I do think there's a lot of predictive capability in just production of currency right one of the one of the things that I also was talking about I was.

And then pretty quickly down the line something else came out that just you know shock a few people in terms of the overall approach so I'm just curious what are your thoughts in terms of the the Fed's consistency lately as it pertains to you know we're saying we're going to do this and this is what's going to happen sort of thing.

What they're saying is we can we can just inflate the money supply and we can create all of these additional units of US dollars and there's not going to be any negative side effects which you can't you can't get you can't get something for nothing so there are there are going to be side effects and. I just I think to answer your question I don't I don't see them reversing course abruptly because they have already gone down this path far enough and a lot of people in this space that are much smarter than I have said that they they basically have their corner they have no easy way out of this and they have to basically continue on this path. Because if they did reverse course abruptly that would you know that would send shockwave through the whole financial system yeah and I think it's it's completely accurate and something that whenever I so I always like to read the minutes and and some of some of what I was picking up is it it really doesn't seem like there they even identify viable alternatives for what they're doing.

And that's more or less I think the punchline here is that they just it doesn't seem like there's a lot of really great alternatives for them to drastically switch gears to so it's yeah it's interesting to hear you kind of seeing the same thing. So on that same vein we're kind of just talking about the markets and some of the layout on what we're seeing one of the questions that I got in was what are some of your kind of preferred strategies for the current market for the current environment I know for myself it's definitely been do all my best to find opportunity where I see it luckily there's been enough volatility and things like index ETFs and a lot of instances so I can kind of stay in a bigger product but still collect what I need to",

So I don't know if you know what I'm going to do with the market. So the main strategy that I've been using for the past like six months I would say this this started last year too when we were deeper in the correction and kind of ascending out of the depths of the correction is I started. I started buying out of the money calls in the furthest expirations that were available and I was doing this in select names and I've actually done it in the SP 500 as well but the whole backdrop for that decision was first of all at the trough of the stock market correction and when we started to bounce off of the lows in March I was assuming that we were that we were just bouncing and we were going to see another. Cratering to the downside and so I started betting against the market pretty heavily and I started to burn a lot of money very quickly because I was paying all this money for these downside right off of positions such as buying upside VXX calls so VXX is a",

So VXX is essentially going to have very similar movements to VIX with some nuances but I was buying out of the money calls in VXX with the assumption that we were going to see another deep correction to the downside probably even lower than the lows that we saw previously and so the market kept going up and this was when the Fed started to come out and you know started saying that they were going to be in the market and we were going to see the same thing. So I started saying that they were going to put all this money into the system and the markets responded very favorably to that and now I understand why because they basically were they call it the Fed put so the Federal Reserve was kind of the backstop on the market right and they would come out once a week and every time the market was down they would come out and they would say something that would re encourage",

If you're profitable then that means you can find higher strike call options that are trading for the same amount of money if not more then you initially paid for those long calls so for example if I buy an out of the money apple call for 10 and it goes to 20 then I know there's a call option at a higher strike price somewhere that's worth 10. And so if I can sell or short a call option against the one I already own but I can short it for the same premium that I paid initially for the long call or even collect more then I create a risk for trade.

And so that's that's what I've been doing essentially and another benefit of that is you are able to stay in the trade without closing it. So you can stay in the trade and allow for more profit potential but it's not the same as closing the whole trade such as just selling the calls outright. So a lot of people will ask me why don't you just sell the calls for the profit why did you spread it off and it's because I can allow for more profit potential since these options or spreads at this point they have so much time until expiration if I have a",

Yeah, one layer deeper than that is if you do that strategy so for example let's say I bought an out of the money call in Tesla Tesla shot up I shorted a higher strike call and I created the risk free spread I sit on that and if Tesla keeps going up then my spread will continue appreciating and value and I'll see more and more profits come in right. So what can happen is Tesla might crash and then that short option that I sold will have lost a ton of value and so I could buy back that short option and basically that would be sort of a wouldn't be a day trade but it would be trading in and out of that short call that initially was to remove all of my risk in the trade.

So basically I created this call spread where I had collected 13,000 for for entering a call debit spread. But it wasn't a debit because I legged into both trades but then what happened is Tesla actually tanked so I was actually able to buy back this 1500 short call I bought it back for like 130 bucks which means I profited by 10,000 on that short call portion.

So one of the cool things with that strategy is that you can actually trade in and out of that short option that you add to the trade to remove all your risk but you actually have you're in a really good position in terms of your chest moves because if the stock price keeps going up. As I said before your spread price will continue to increase and you will continue to make money on that position but if the stock price crashes then you can actually exit that short call position harvest some profit from it and then if you still have 600 days or whatever on your long call and the stock price goes back up you can sell it again and so you can kind of trade in and out of that short option so",

Yeah in exploration but like the way that you kind of talk about setting it up it's really beautiful to kind of give it a little time before offering that short because of exactly that benefit I think that honestly it's it's a really really good approach for me I've always done kind of I guess a derivative of that where a lot of times when I'm setting up a leap diagonal the first set of shorts that I offer might be like a third of the overall position something like that so it's a similar idea I actually I",

Thank you that that brings up a good point and I want to clarify a couple things too so first of all yeah you have to be patient with that strategy because you obviously need a big movement in your favor before it will be possible to create that risk free spread.

Even though it's a small portion of the account it can still drive super strong overall account returns right and so that's another thing is you with these positions it's not like i'm i'm not putting 100 of the account into these long call trades they make up a small portion of the overall account value right but they still they sell a lot of potential to drive really strong overall account returns and I think also since they are a smaller portion. Of the account value that gives me peace of mind in being able to hold them longer whereas if you had a much larger position like you put your whole account into a long call trade and it goes. Now in your favor for a few days maybe a few weeks you are probably going to be inclined to spread off that position prematurely when you can get a much better position overall if you're just a little more patient right but at the end of the day like you still need that movement in your favor i'm not going to try to make it sound easy sure it is just a really really well performing strategy over the past year",

Another thing I wanted to talk about is people ask me well how do you choose the stocks to do this in and. It's a really hard question answer because you like I said you have to be right about that directional movement and therefore you should be putting it putting it on in the stock or company that. You have a high conviction will actually move in your favor not immediately, but over the course of that trade and this is why I like to go super far out in time. Is that people will say well you're buying those options that are 750 days out but you're paying so much for them and i'm comfortable paying the higher premium. For those longer term options because I know that it's much easier on me psychologically yeah there's another benefit that I have to. To not have to pearl that that prediction and be 100 right about you know it's just going up 100 dollars in the next seven days otherwise.

For a lot of people if they're buying far out of the money options that expire in two weeks sure they're cheaper but beta is not doing any favors, whereas once you're out that far. Realistically you're doing a great job minimizing the impact of theta so yes it's you know more out of your pocket up front, but you have a higher expectation to at least collect something on on what you're putting out there right and I think if. And in that same vein I would I would choose companies that. Are pretty well known like the companies that i've done this exact strategy in our. Tesla I have an open position like this in apple but this is the apple position is it's not super successful right now but. You know I have actually with the apple position I bought calls and apple went down and those calls went down 50 value but I still had a lot of cash on the sidelines because that position was small which is what I got back to you what I was telling you about before.

And then I bought five more contracts at five dollars each. And I actually went one expiration further so these options had like 730 days at the time of entering and so now I own a total of 10 contracts but the average cost per contract is somewhere around seven to 7.50 as opposed to nine dollars and. Getting back to what I said before i'm very comfortable having that position on an apple because. Everybody loves apple and I think also with the the upcoming 5g revolution I think apple stands to benefit immensely from that and so i'm comfortable having that long term position on in apple. Let me tell you if they don't bring back the thumb brand i'm going to throw a right because they need to bring the thumb back.

If if you have the assumption that the market is going to go up. On average each year and you're comfortable with that thesis that overall the market goes up long term then I think spy is a great product for this exact strategy because it's a very liquid product so you have. There's a lot of things that I think that's a good product for this market. And it's not like you're trading some penny stock where nobody knows about it and the options have no liquidity and you're just putting on these long calls just to kind of throw a hail Mary so thing when in doubt if.

I think that would be no that's a good piece of advice that I can give but other than that if you have a specific company that you're you have a high conviction on over the next one to two years then I think the strategy works nicely but as I as we talked about before you have to have. So you have to be able to hold and also you have to you know have that conviction and be patient if it does move in your favor because if you spread it off too early then what's going to happen is you're going to have a narrow call spread. And if you have a really narrow call spread that has 700 days expiration it's really not going to move much right you really need all of that time to come out and you're basically going to have to sit there and wait for 700 days even if that spread gets fully in the money to see that spreads value increase. So that's why like waiting longer is because if you're spreading off the trade when the stock price has gone up a really good amount and you're able to get a really wide call spread that's my ideal situation so in the Tesla example I bought the 900 call and then I was able to short the 1500 call so that's",

You know the the 950 call because to me that's basically you're basically just selling the option at that point right the closer is actually interesting interesting thing to think about. The closer you sell the if you're if you're going to spread a trade or you buy an option and then you're going to short an option against it the closer the short option is to your original strike the closer represents just closing. The original option because if you think about it to think about the same strike if you buy the 900 call stock price goes up and then you short the 900 call you're effectively just closing your original position right but if you shorted the 905 call you didn't close your original 900 call but you're you've shorted an option that's so close to your original strike that it's almost represents just selling the original position right.

Was what are some products that you typically trade that you haven't favored quite as much just in the current markets and you had an interesting answer when I asked you that before so curious i'm curious you know to explore that a little bit with you.

My approach is just to stick to the companies that I know and not not like know them in terms of how the stocks mover stuff like that because you know and knows that but just like the companies that if you were walking down the street and you mentioned a company name any average person would know what company you're talking about those are the companies that I stick with primarily. One thing that's going to mine though is I used to trade a lot of SV XY SV XY is an inverse volatility product if anybody remembers XIV. If anybody remembers XIV SV XY is essentially the same thing as XIV except XIV never had tradable options XIV people just traded the shares. But SV XY had tradable options so I used to trade a lot of SV XY however when the whole vol apocalypse happened when XIV was terminated because it lost 95 of its value overnight they actually reduce the leverage on SV XY so it used to be a negative one",

If VXX went up 10 in one day SV XY would go down 10 one day right but after that whole volatility calamity I should say they actually cut SV XY is leverage in half so now it's a negative 0.5 X so it's the fun and that if VXX goes up 10 then SV XY will go down 5 and if VXX goes down 5 SV XY will go up 2.5. See I wasn't a big fan of the leverage cut and they actually did the same thing in VXY 2 and VXY was 2X and now it's 1.5. So they reduced the leverage in those products and that kind of eliminated some of the interest in it for me. So these days if I'm trading a volatility product it's most likely VXX. Actually very recently I had a nice trade in VXX which I talked about a little bit on a live stream but VX the VX was at like 20 and the near term VX futures were like 25 and what happens is the VX futures over time will converge to whatever index",

But anyways VX was at 20 the VX futures are at 25 and I was like if if the VX stays here or goes lower then these futures are going to converge down to the VX index and they're going to lose like 20 of value.

And I ended up closing all those out for more than a dollar so that was that was a really sizable trade and that was probably the biggest winner I've had in VXX and a while. But that was the first speculative trade that I use in VXX that wasn't actually a hedge because sometimes I'll use VXX and buy some out of the money calls just to have some portfolio insurance. Sure. Because as we talked about earlier, if the market crashes the VX index will shoot up and that'll bring the futures with it and since VXX is tracking the VX futures that means VXX will go up as well.

He had a position on where he actually bought a ton of VXX out of the money calls and he spread off the risk way too early and he eventually got out of the position. And if he would have held those options, he would have made like a quarter million dollars. At any at any of the prices where VXX was, you know, 50 plus. But he, I mean, he did 10X his account. He went from like. He turned like a five five thousand dollar account into like 25,000 so it wasn't it wasn't a 10X it was many multiples.

But what people miss is. For that one thousand dollars to go to two million. You had to watch the 1000 go to 10,000 without selling. And then you had to watch that that 1000 go to 10,000 and then you had to watch it go to 50,000 without you selling. So the only way you get to that 2 million is if you actually had the conviction to hold the whole time. And I think that's a really important concept just to throw into this conversation because. That's my exact philosophy with Bitcoin. Because I bought a bunch of Bitcoin last year. And right after the, the depths of the coronavirus, I didn't get to buy Bitcoin at like 5K. But I bought a bulk of my position at like 9 to 15,000. And I went into that position with a very long term mindset. And it's gone really well thus far. And I just,",

And as soon as I started seeing it, you know, four years down the line. Fiber done a line making kind of crazy moves. I started pairing the position until I eventually paired myself out of it all the way. But one of the things that I integrate in a lot of my trading plans is partial profit taking. There are some realized gains based on risk offered and then still leaving a good portion on for future potential returns. And one of the things that I also like to highlight why I've gone that way is because for everybody, you know, exactly like you said, right, the MxM. Amazon example, if you take 1K, would it be, you know, 2 plus million if you held the time and then, you know, if you kind of zoom that out, if you, you know, picked a basket of 30 stocks and did that 1,000 in all of them, one of them maybe Amazon, maybe, not too likely.

That's a good argument too is that I would never look at a stock right now, a publicly traded company and say, this is the next Amazon. Right. But I think in the case of Bitcoin, I think probably like waiting the probabilities, I think Bitcoin has the highest probability of anything right now of being the next Amazon over the next 10 plus years, like longer than that decades. And I fully, I also fully expect or accept, sorry, not expect, I accept the risk that I have. And if it goes to zero, then I've actually actually thought about this.

And why don't we have a different approach where, you know, we keep the money supply the same. I think Bitcoin overall for me has been a net positive.

And then, you know, you kind of asked, well, what's priced in? You know, it's still, it's still being figured out how they're going to integrate it into the economy. I think the comparison that people always use is kind of the most common valuation metric for valuing or at least a big milestone for valuing Bitcoin is people compared to gold because it has all the characteristics of gold except it's better on basically every metric with the exception of having a multi thousand year history of being used as a store value. That's really the only thing Bitcoin does not have that gold has because Bitcoin has all the other characteristics except for that track record. Well, you could argue that gold has a physical purpose, not saying that it's like, that's true. So that's another argument too, is that gold has a physical use case where as Bitcoin doesn't have any physical use cases because it's, it lives in the atmosphere essentially.

Right. Anyways, that's an interesting way to interpret it too is that like in the US, we have the US dollar and in the EU, they have the euro. Right. So there's all these currencies, forms of money that are used in all these different countries. And if you were to kind of zoom out on, if you just think of a kind of like an international space station view of earth and you're, you're watching all these countries come by and then you see, you know, the different currency symbols on each country. Yeah. But then you have the Bitcoin symbol, which is like in the atmosphere around the whole globe. So that's kind of the whole idea is that shit. You just got a sales pitch right there.

But the market cap of Bitcoin is around one trillion. And so if you, if you increase Bitcoin's market cap to be the same as gold, then you get 500,000 per Bitcoin. So that's the, the Wink of Oz twins made a big right up about that. And that was their case. And that's how they backed into the 500 K per Bitcoin was if Bitcoin matches gold and overtakes its market cap, it will be 500,000 per Bitcoin. But the interesting thing is earlier we were talking about asset prices and their performance. So I, this video that I'm writing that'll be out this week. I was actually looking at the year-to-date performance of certain assets. So I looked at the SP 500. It's up about 12 year-to-date. Bitcoin's up 84 year-to-date. Real estate. I couldn't find a year-to-date metric, but I told you earlier I was looking at real estate, a real estate pricing index by the FHFA, Federal Housing Finance Agency.

Gold is, let's see, where was the, so gold is down year-to-date. And that's very interesting for Bitcoin because a lot of people, there's a lot of people that are big believers in gold, but they don't believe in Bitcoin. But as I said earlier, Bitcoin has all the characteristics of gold, except improvements in the characteristics. And it's very interesting that something like Bitcoin, if it's up 84 this year, then why is gold down? And if gold is seen as a inflation hedge, then why is gold down this year, given what we've seen in all other asset prices, and with gold being kind of like the go-to inflation hedge? That's an interesting thing. So the argument there is people, the argument is that Bitcoin is eating gold. So people are selling gold to buy Bitcoin, and that's why gold is down.

Right. Yeah, it's honestly, that's a really interesting perspective. I can't say that something I've personally thought about much is kind of the relationship between Bitcoin and Bitcoin directly. And that's a really good question, because I've heard a lot of people speculating on, a lot of people are moving from things like gold into real estate with rates being as low as they were, and things like that. But I honestly think there's a really good argument to say something like Bitcoin could absolutely be starting to take away a good portion of gold's quote-unquote market share as people are kind of starting to adopt that kind of thing.

So keeping your Bitcoin on an exchange like Coinbase, technically they are the ones that are holding the keys to your wallet. And therefore, you don't really own that Bitcoin. So the same thing is true for gold. I've actually looked into buying gold historically, and the only true way to really own gold is to buy physical bars of gold and put it in the safe in my closet.
