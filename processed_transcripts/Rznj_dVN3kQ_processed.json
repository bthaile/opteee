Now the one thing I am always supremely confident in though is that I'll be able to figure it out. I never fear not being able to figure it out, but sometimes it's a little convoluted. Awesome. So it looks like we have the whole gang in town. First things first, we have to update our app map and we actually have, let me see. I think from the last video, we had a bunch of people, we had a bunch of people from all different spots. Let me grab, grab in the comments from the last video that I can update it for us. And then as always, if you are dialing in from somewhere, let me know where. And then I can add you to, okay, here we go. So we had Lithuania, that's kind of a fun one. That was not on our map before. That is from smile up drone, that's fun. We have cork Ireland. Which we had not had before. We have Cyprus. That's a. I also did not know that there was a Cyprus in London. Did you guys know that? And then we have Delaware beautiful. So we got, we're all updated on our spots. We are ready to rock and roll. A little bit of a bumpy start, but we're here ready to move it along. We have a Largo Florida. Let's find",

And then specifically with this, let's take a second and go visit your hood. I like to do this. I don't really know why I like to do this, to be honest, but I do. And let's go to Largo Florida. Close this. And we're just going to cruise around your hood a little bit. Where do you guys want to go? Do you guys want to go to Belier Beach? Yankee Club? Clear water I've been to? Indian shores? Where should we go? Let me know what kind of creep and we're going to do around Largo to see where Trippie Micah's from. And then for the agenda today, we're going to work through some of the due diligence, but actually the thing I want to start us off with is going to be peaking at Max Payne. I want to talk a little bit about Max Payne, especially with the clothes that we had on Friday. I think it's pertinent. No preferences for where we creep around. Somewhere on the peninsula, okay?

It's wildly different, which I always find very interesting. Yeah, the beach is always very flat. There's no waves. And another thing I always find in Florida is that there are like this greenery. I forgot what it's called, but that's that breakdown space. It has a specific name. I literally just don't remember what it is. What is it called? And there's certain kinds of plants and stuff that live here. Yeah, this looks like very standard Florida. I was there not too long ago visiting, well, being, oh, that's pretty. You can just see the humidity. Very cool. All right. So now we know what it's like around. Largo, Florida. We were looking at Mel and I when we were looking at moving, we were potentially looking at St. Petersburg for a little while. I remember that popped up on the list. And then there was another one that popped up on the list. It wasn't Cape Crow. Here, soda was another one. And then there's another spot that was somewhere along this coast. I don't remember where.

But it's a little too flat for Mel, rightfully so it's a little too humid for me. So it looks like it's probably not going to be our bag. All right. So let's grab the DD library that we ran last time. And this. And I think I actually spoke about splitting this to be able to run the AI assistant. I'm going to see what the size this feature only supports files with less than 600 pages. So I think what I'm going to do while we're here for a second is edit this file. I'm going to split it into two. And this way we can use. We'll be able to use the AI tool that's built in, which I think will be really useful. Because the way that we're doing it now where we're copying, pacing it to chat you, PTs just a little bit slower than I think it should be. Extract pages as separate files. I don't want to. You have to, I guess that's. Let's split it up. Something around 400 pages will take off. Split it up to here. And then. Yeah, 409. That's perfect. Extract these. Perfect. So it did",

I can confirm. Oh, whoa, this is like the perfect meme. Yeah. So anyways, this is the exact one that I saw though, because I could tell this one moved a little more widely.

This one. Hey, that's actually really cool. It might be because I'm on my browser. It's probably less, less impressive. Well, anyways, for those that are wondering, I'm Google searching Max Pan.

Let's take a look at this. So. Lauren is Lauren is laughing at my search result. I thought I've listened man, maybe one day, maybe one day. All right, let's read this. Max Pan theory popular among retail investors postulates that options, expiration, the price, the underlying stock converge to the stock price at which the aggregate total payment obligations of store position is the lowest. This is under the assumption that the market maker is the counter party to the trades. And that most trades are bought to open. That's the assumption. I have, as you saw in those Google results, I do have a video that talks about Max Pan. And it reviews a bunch of the research. I don't want to spend a ton of time on it, but I do think the close from Friday is at least worth a discussion point on it. So I'll slide this out of the way just for now. And we can see that we closed that 2799.",

And we can see that we closed that 2799. So here's the, the world of Max Pan at a high level. It's very difficult to prove there's a lot of research out there that points in different directions. This isn't research that's done by market itself. It's typically done by different kinds of schools and educational institutions. And they see slightly different things from a logical perspective. There is an incentive there. And any time there is an incentive in financial markets for potentially somebody's benefit, you have to take it seriously, I think, because the only reason why all of us are in markets is to make money. So all of that being said, there is a propensity for options to somehow draw the price of the underlying where Max Pan exists. Now there's a couple of things to know about Max Pan. Let me see if I can grab it. I think it's from unusual wails. I think they have a tool for that. Let me see. No. No. I'm looking for the specific plots that I'm trying to find. No, no, no.

And I think most of you guys are familiar with this one. Of Rointit says we've been saying that for a while. Yeah, no, this isn't new ground. There's an important point behind this though, because one of the things that retail traders I find tend to do is they automatically think Max Pan is causing essentially all movement around expiration. And the problem with that is a few things. So first things first, if we take a look at these different strike prices, one of the things that's going to happen naturally in the options chain as time passes is we are going to ebb and flow where Max Pan is. Max Pan is not static. So Max Pan is almost always going to be near the money. Almost not always, but almost the reason is because that's where options are most liquid. And that tends to be",

Almost not always, but almost the reason is because that's where options are most liquid. And that tends to be where traders are transacting are front expiration near the money. So it creates a near self fulfilling prophecy where stock price tends to follow around, move around where Max Pan seems to be, but the options market is moving in the background also trading around where stock price is. So the important element here is to know Max Pan is not static. If we take a look at Max Pan today and we track it against what it is at expiration, it will be different. That's an important no. Pretty much half to track it. So this would show Max Pan. That's kind of hard to tell. It's so skewed. That's actually really interesting. How skewed it is. Does this show. That's kind of a bummer. It would have been, I thought they had a thing that showed it like day by day. That would, I think, be really, really helpful for people to see like how it moves. But Max Pan will move. Now that part aside, the other element to know for the market making perspective is market makers have the ability to move price. How much is difficult to say? It's very difficult to quantify.

Now that part aside, the other element to know for the market making perspective is market makers have the ability to move price. How much is difficult to say? It's very difficult to quantify. In order for them to move price, options do not lead the market. Options are derivatives. The value of an option is derived from the underlying. But options positions depending on who holds them, sometimes will include hedging activity that includes the underlying itself. So that line becomes muddled a little bit. So when we have a stock in a situation like GameStop, and we have the ability for the stock to either land at 28 or 27.99, literally a one penny difference. A market maker or group of market makers might be able to force price down by selling a bunch of shares just to dip the price down a little bit. It's easier said than done. And it's more applicable to smaller price movements. One of the things I see people say is, oh, they didn't want it to land in 30. So they pushed it down from 30. I'm not saying whether they did or didn't. I couldn't prove it to you either way. That's why I wouldn't say whether they did or didn't. I don't know.

But what I can tell you is the further away it is, the harder it becomes for an entity to try and manipulate price in that way, because if market consensus is for whatever reason, market consensus thinks the stock should be 30. And then a group of market makers start trying to offload and sell shares or whatever they can get their hands on to try to drive price down. But the market's like, wait a minute, this is easily worth 30. I'm going to buy it here. I'm going to keep buying it here. That will add buy side pressure to counteract that push down. There's a limit to how far price can be manipulated in this way. When something is moved by a penny, that's not that fucking hard to do. It's very, very realistic. If the stock could have closed at 28 versus 27. 99, I absolutely would expect there to be a large group of interested participants, market makers, that would rather see this at 27, 99 versus 28. That is not as big of a move that they need to try to facilitate. And here's what I mean by this. If we take a look at the daily volume, the daily volume was 6.8 million shares.

If we take a look at the daily volume, the daily volume was 6.8 million shares. Let's grab our little, a little dude ad here. So 6.8 or 6.5, sorry. 6.581. 6,5886. And then let's just say that the mid price on this around would be 28 and a half, something like that. We can calculate what the total value is that moved on the day. This is essentially just a V-wap. So 6.5, 81, 586, times 28.5. 187,577,201. Now, that's the total amount of volume on the day. With smaller stocks like this, moving this from 28, 27,99 is a pretty small move. So even though the total volume on the day, let's just call it, it was 188 million in terms of price and value. In order to move this by a penny, it still requires a subset of this and not an insignificant subset of this. We can actually do the math, but it doesn't matter quite that much. The point to be aware of is that market makers are incentivized to have more options expire worthless. If there's a way for them to collude together or with other entities to drive price down by a penny, which is the difference between several thousand options expiring in or out of the money, they're incentivized to do so.

So I don't know. That being said, there's a difference between this scenario and then the people that say, well, it should have been at 30, but market makers manipulated it down to 27.99. This becomes a big gap to cross because still it's doing 200 million in volume on a day. And again, I'm not saying that it couldn't be done, especially if it's broader spread collusion and stuff like that easier to detect. There's a lot of risk involved in doing that, especially if they're trying to short it, and then there's some sort of meteoric rise for some reason or another. So this just becomes a taller task is all I'm saying. So when we have the conversation around, oh, obviously it's being manipulated for Max Payne, there's two things I always want you to remember.

But you should know those two data points when we look at this stuff. Brick and the wall says are there other stocks where this sticks out as much as GME? I would actually argue that there's stocks where it's much worse than GME. GME is still a pretty big stock. So it's doing 200 million total volume in a day. If we take a look at total shares, it's 446, I don't know what the current market cap is, 446, 800, 365, times 27, 99. So it's a 12.5 billion dollar company. That is not a small stock. Where Max Payne and stuff like that becomes really, really pronounced is in small stocks because it's much easier and more accessible for market makers to manipulate the price because they don't have to use as much total money to do so. GameStop, I think, gets the focal point of it because people are looking at it a lot. And people are obviously highly, highly interested in the company and the stock.

And the way that they track, by the way, which is ingenious, the way that they track whether or not they think in this study is they use a reversal pattern. They say coming into exploration on expiration day, what happens to the stock price and then what happens on Monday after Friday? Does the stock price immediately rebound up? And then they're using that as a proxy for it being manipulated down and then value resumes to the upside. Completely reasonable proxy. It's still not perfect though.

So yeah, I can grab a, well, the link to the study that I have won't take you to it because it's in open browser, but you can literally just type in SSRN and dump in Max Payne. It'll come up. Fischau. So that's the, that's the game of Max Payne. There's absolutely a reality. There's absolutely an incentive behind it. But that being said, even if we track something like dollar delta and whatnot, it'll have, it'll have a different view as price moves. Because as price moves, more options are going to be open and closed around different prices. And that's also going to interact with Max Payne and whatever Max Payne is. So you can see that where the total dollar amount of open interests are. And you can speculate then at those price levels, what might be a better spot for a market maker to prospectively try to push price down. And again, like the 30 strike is clear as 20, well, 30 strike is going to be heavier than the 28s. But still the 28s will have something in them for sure. Here. So interesting stuff. But you should, I think, generally, be aware of that. Samota says it's not, it's not that they can hold on. It's not",

Yeah, I would, it depends how the option chain is loaded up. Exactly. That's exactly correct. So I would just decouple the concept of Max Payne from a gamma squeeze. They're just different functions. They do different things. From a Max Payne perspective, the market makers are absolutely incentivized to have as many options expire out of the money worthless as possible, assuming that they are the ones that sold the options to whoever bought them, which is a completely fair and safe assumption. That's objectively the case. They're incentivized to do something like that. So from that function, the purpose of Max Payne is to save them some hedging cost because they're not going to make the money or not based on Max Payne. They still made their money. They make the money on the bid-ask spread. It's just can they make a little bit more money, which they can, which is why they're incentivized to do so. But Max Payne, like the Max Payne has",

It's just can they make a little bit more money, which they can, which is why they're incentivized to do so. But Max Payne, like the Max Payne has a constraint because it requires quite literal collusion in order to push price. Because if you have a stock that's doing 200 million of volume in a day, in order for you as the participant, in this case, the market maker, to try and push the price down, you're going to have to put up a percentage of that total daily volume in order to make a meaningful move in the price. So that's why smaller moves are entirely feasible. Because it's very expensive and it's a big risk for them to carry it. But if it's a smaller move, it's easier to carry that risk. But if we're talking like trying to suppress price five dollars as a market maker, that's much, much, much more difficult. Much, much more difficult. Espionore Wall says, I've seen price move aggressively in the last hour to day to get to Max Payne, assuming it was un-hege calls that expire at the close could also be self-fulfilling of traders or watch your Max Payne.

It's going to be close, more often than not. That's not to say that it's guaranteed, but it's going to be close. So then at that point, you have options traders who have options that still have some value that they're saying, do I want to hold this in expiration and see if it moves in my favor? Do I want to scrap what value I can out of this and roll it into another trade? And it's a toss up. They probably want to do both. So you're also seeing traders transacting and making decisions about their positioning. So it's not inherently a rush to get to Max Payne.

But that's the thing is like the participants in the options buyers are not incentivized to look in the correct direction. The reason why I would wage your it's collusion more than anything for Max Payne to work is because if you had one market maker on any any style of frequency on Friday towards the end of the because everything on their books is tracked. It's not hidden. So if you have one market maker that happens to be towards the very end of the day selling five million dollars worth of GameStop shares short to push the price down a penny, that's going to stick out like a sore fucking thumb.

Roy and Titi says, margin calls is what I was talking about. I meant liquid dations and margin calls at 2 p.m. I honestly don't know. I've never had that done. I don't know what time that happens. I would imagine that's a little late for a margin call. But I don't know. Yeah, I don't know the answer to that one. We're in Titi and I don't want to give you a ballman's or oh, damn, you only get to ask it like two questions. This is terrible. Let's see if I can get it to work. Summarize this section. If you can do it. If not, we already have a proven way to do this. I was kind of hoping that this would work though. Not that this seems any faster as I'm sitting here waiting. Roy and Titi says option exploration and liquidation for options, expiring on the same day brokers may liquidate positions as early as 1,600 eastern time. Yep, that makes sense. Oh, 2 p.m. Wait, that's different. I don't know where you got that from, but that's wrong. The times are wrong because 2 p.m. eastern time is 1,400, not 1,600. Those are 1,600 would be 4 p.m. which would be end of day close, which would make sense. To ensure timely settlement and avoid potential issues is because options that are",

To ensure timely settlement and avoid potential issues is because options that are in the money at expiration will need to automatically be exercised and brokers need to manage their clients accordingly. Yeah, so and in that kind of instance, Roy and Titi, I think that whatever the time actually is, I'm assuming it'll be 2 p.m. So it's a little bit earlier is that's looking at stuff that's like super deep in the money, right? Stuff that definitively is overwhelmingly likely to end up in the money. I don't think it's in the case of something that's like at the money, which is an important differentiation. Okay, so the section that it provides a detailed analysis of the short interest percent based on various data points calculations, the analysis includes references to other users' post data such as deep in the money call options and their impact on synthetic shares. The other estimates that the current short interest percentage for GME is significantly higher than publicly reported figures exceeding 200 of the flow section emphasizes the complexity and potential manipulation of the market highlighting challenges and accurately determining true short interest. I mean, that sounds right to me. I think that that's also something that we've taken a look at before, so",

Out-of-the-money puts used to hide short interest. This has no effect on price of GME because it's not being exercised and they maintain, oh, I even until expiration, shorters are using these to hide short interest from the world. The main counter argument to the MOAS is their short interest is 20. They covered. So if you're shorter and you hide your short interest, you can push that narrative and hope people.

So to draw the direct conclusion here of short interest percent dropping when put oh I sky rockets. This does not equal causation. I'm not saying it doesn't equal causation. But we can't like based on this itself. We cannot make that causative statement. Because when short interest becomes super high, a billion other things are going on at the same exact time.

Yeah, well, there is a couple. A couple key ways that they were doing it. But Brookheathamall says a way to set their shares to say their shares are real and not synthetic. Yeah, no. So I'm familiar with what they're trying to do. The the question I'm having here is the relationship that they're identifying here specifically of using out of the money puts to hide short and functionally how that how that's happening. And the other like the other element of this that just isn't correct slightly nitpicky, but still I think worth mentioning at this point is that buying a lot of out of the money puts still has still has an effect. It's not it's not a function of whether or not they're exercised exercising them isn't the only way for them to have an effect, which is just important to know it doesn't really impact this example that much.

I'm going to open the door so he can go grab some of it. And off he goes. All right, let me get back into the regular screen here. Okay, I'll see what Newton comes back with. In the money puts are used. Cedric says Thor is a god. Yeah, exactly. He that's correct. That's his history. He's a little baby. He can't be a terrorist. That's exactly what Mel says. So then he's able to run a mock and terrorize crazy. That's absolutely crazy. Lauren says he's going to have a ponytail soon like a boomer portfolio manager.

And they got ran over so hard that they'd rather just hold the position. But there is a cost to hold those open shorts. So there's not you can't find a free short because even from like say for example, if you try to short a stock on your brokerage platform, you obviously have to borrow the stock. And then you have to borrow the stock. And then you pay a rate because you're borrowing something that you don't own. Now obviously the relationship will be completely different with the way that institutions can short they can set up swaps and things like that. But even a swap has a cost to carry, which would lead me to believe that the constitution of the shorts probably looks different for hedge funds versus the idea of market makers having uncovered short positions. My guess is that the constitutions of the shorts would be very different. And the way that the shorts are managed would be very different. And that's one of the things that confounds me a little bit when I read through the different DD because it always looks like we're looking at it from one perspective. That's actually what begged the question here because as I'm reading this, it still looks like",

That's actually what begged the question here because as I'm reading this, it still looks like we're continuing to think of the shorts as universal all short all in the same boat. And I actually don't think that's likely to be the case because the way that different entities would short would look slightly different. And then I think the way that they would maintain the short would also look different because the the game of satisfying FDDs from a market-making perspective is really important. Obviously, which is why a lot of them would likely find ways to satisfy FDDs so that they don't pop up on right-hand stuff like that. That becomes a problem in a threat to the business. But for hedge funds, they probably have different ways of maintaining and holding the position. And hedge funds are really the ones that would probably be more involved in the seller boxing side of things and actually trying to press price down to zero. So that I just think is a bit of a breakdown from some of what I've seen here.

You boys get a sick forearm pump right now. Moving this mouse is going to be real tricky. Any other guesses? The reason why I ask is because like the idea of the cat caching out and then GME as a movement slowing down is really curious because it then opens the question of how do we think about the interplay between other institutions and to Roy and Titi's point, the GameStop revolution. Because I agree that the GameStop revolution is the absolute heart and soul is the retail trader like without it now. I guess I should say retail investor.

This is 130 million. This is 254 million. Like the price movements coming up here, I would wager would be really difficult to tie directly to retail. And I would still imagine that a significant portion of this would be institutions of some sort trading the general price movements.

And that's typically when there's a bit of a disagreement between what expected price should be for something for whatever the market consensus is, the difference between buyers and sellers, trying to find whatever price they think makes sense. All right, so let's see. Well, it's alleged at the moment it's clear that some law firms believe that there's a case against multiple entities, including DTCC for conspiracy shutting down the January 28th squeeze. I agree with that. I think that makes a lot of sense. Lauren says, I don't understand why him taking profits at points would upset people so much he spoke about trimming positions. Yeah, that's really interesting. I think a lot of people view him as",

So I think people believe that if he gets out of it, then essentially their price generator has left. So at least from my best guess, I think that's mostly why you see that perspective taken by people. CDJ says, won't RK have to pay taxes if he gets out of it? If he's in a standard margin account, if he's in some sort of tax advantage to count then no. But if he's in a standard margin account, then yes. What is this?

The entire system and banks are going to go belly up because the scenario described everything short DD. I don't think so. They're reacting to increased liquidity requirements stemming from last year and the expiration of a cellar. Oh man, I'm confused. Next is multiple lose.

Because if you have a position on and you don't do anything with it, you don't manage it, you don't close it, you don't do anything with it, you can't make any money on it.

No, he couldn't. Absolutely, he could not. One, because we can see all the way back through all of his original portfolio updates, there was never a short call in there. But more importantly, short calls at the scale that he hit absolutely could bring him money, but it's not going to build you wealth. Short calls, they're defined profit by their nature. So a lot of people are speculating and it's it's really interesting to me that people are so adverse to him selling his shares that we willingly take the leap into something that's a more convoluted explanation for what likely is to have happened because none of us can fully prove it one way or the other, which is very fascinating to me because the simplest explanation would be that he very effectively traded around his positions, buying low selling high, continuing to do that.

When you make money as a trader, that's a good day. So I think for individual retail traders, they have to integrate that into their approach. The buy and hold thing is fine. If somebody thinks that that's the right approach for them, but that's also dangerous because if the primary profit mechanism that we're talking about is a short squeeze or a gamma squeeze or some sort of squeeze, a big price movement, but then there's no expectation to sell, you're unable to monetize the price movement. It's just an unrealized gain that sits there and that doesn't ultimately help you buy more shares or do whatever the ultimate objective is or take your money out and use that to change your family's life, whatever the ultimate objective is. So that's been a pretty consistent breakdown as far as I can see with the logic of people that are hoping for some sort of squeeze, but then they don't have at least some sort of exit plan in place to monetize it because otherwise you can go",

He didn't die in hand, obviously. Yeah, well, and I think that's the other thing that happened with the game stop stuff is that that clearly went into what he rightfully labeled a yolo portfolio where he was just saying that somebody that took 100,000 at the onset. And they said, this 100,000, it's a lot of money, but I can make that again, or I'm good without it. And I'm going to see what I can do with it. That's exactly what that was, which is very cool.

And that's, I completely agree because especially for the people that are talking about like buy hold, D.R.S., that's fine too. But the main thing is for those kinds of people, if you do that, you don't",

But the main thing is for those kinds of people, if you do that, you don't monetize the move. And that's why like the move here from 14 up to 64, you can make a lot of money on it. You can make a lot of money on it. But if you buy and hold and your shares are D.R.S., you've essentially made, which still isn't bad, by the way. But like you essentially would have made that what nine and change and you're sitting at 28 now. But you had an exit point here to be, shit. From, I mean, there's just so many potential exit points for somebody that was getting in pre squeeze here. So yeah, it's just, that's a long holding period from here to here to go from five or nine and then to be sitting at 28 after four years or five years when all of these individual spikes can be monetized. And I mean, you guys, I keep it completely straight with you guys. I hold shares just as a play of solidarity with the apes. But it's a very small subset of my total capital. And what I do mostly with GameStop is I trade the movements because it moves really well. And there's a lot of ways",

But buying and holding, especially something like this, it will, will take a little bit of time. I think the company looks good. I think the prospects of the company turning around are really strong. But I do think that the company is positioned well. But that kind of stuff still takes time to eventually come to the surface, which that's what people will have to be willing to hold through. And even that, they need to have an exit here, an exit plan in order to eventually make the money. Because otherwise it just sits as an unrealized game, which is cool to have. But you that doesn't pay bills. And that's not the the thing that will ultimately change, you know, somebody's life that they'll they'll want to find ways. Even if it's one of the easiest ways things can do is take partial profits.

They're literally looking for something to lead to a significant change in their current life, scenario, their life perspective, the situation that they're in. And I want to see people be able to do that because trading is unequivocally done that for me. Like it literally has done that exact thing for me. So I know it can be done.
