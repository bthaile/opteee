Now, the one thing I am always supremely confident in though is that I'll be able to figure it out. I never fear not being able to figure it out, but sometimes it's a little convoluted. Awesome. So it looks like we have the whole gang in town. First things first, we have to update our app map. And we actually have, let me see, I think from the last video, we had a bunch of people. We had a bunch of people from all different spots. Let me grab, grab in the comments from the last video that I can update it for us. And then as always, if you are dialing in from somewhere, let me know where. And then I can add you to, okay, here we go. So we had Lithuania, that's kind of a fun one. That was not on our map before. That is from smile up drone. That's fun. We have cork Ireland. Which we had not had before. We have Cyprus. I also did not know that there was a Cyprus in London. Did you guys know that? And then we have Delaware beautiful. So we got, we're all updated on our spots. We are ready to rock and roll. A little bit of a bumpy start, but we're here ready to move it along. We have a Largo Florida. Let's find Largo Florida.",

Close this. And we're just going to cruise around your hood a little bit. You guys want to go. Do you guys want to go to Belier Beach, St. Key Club, Clear Water I've been to Indian shores. Where should we go? Let me know what kind of creep and we're going to do around Largo to see where. Triple mic is from. And then for the agenda today, we're going to work through some of the due diligence. But actually, the thing I want to start us off with is going to be peaking at Max Payne. I want to talk a little bit about Max Payne, especially with the clothes that we had on Friday. I think it's pertinent. No preferences for where we, where we creep around. Somewhere on the peninsula.

It's wildly different. Which I always find very interesting. The beach is always very flat. There's no waves. And another thing I always find in Florida is that there are like this greenery. I forgot what it's called, but that's. That breakdown space. It has a specific name. I literally just don't remember what it is. What is it called? And there's certain kinds of plants and stuff that. It's like a very, very normal life. Live here. But yeah, this looks like very standard Florida. I was there not too long ago visiting. Well, being. Oh, that's pretty. You can just see the humidity. Very cool. All right. So now we know what it's like around.

So I think what I'm going to do. While we're here for a second is. Edit this this. File. I'm going to split it into two. And this way we can use. We'll be able to use the AI tool that's built in which I think will be really useful. Because the way that we're doing it now where we're copying and pasting it to chat you. PTs just a little bit slower than I think it should be. Extract pages as separate files I don't want to. You have to. I guess that's. So let's split it up something around 400 pages will take off.

So most of the stuff that I tend to follow are information sites of some sort. But yeah, I think follow away if you guys like his stuff. So that's red. Rantini says, but where are the Greg posts? I'm only seeing Chuck Hodle. I don't think it's from Greg. I think this is. This is Greg joking about it. Right. I am not a cat. And this is somebody saying you're the first person slash cat I've subscribed to. So he's obviously slightly involved in the joke, but it looks like he's not, not directly discussing it beyond this.

Let's take a look at this. So. Lauren is Lauren is laughing at my search result. I thought I've listen, man, maybe one day, maybe one day. All right, let's read this. Max Payne theory popular among retail investors postulates that options expiration, the price, the underlying stock converge to the stock price at which the aggregate total payment obligations of store position is the lowest. This is under the assumption that the market maker is the counter party to the trades and that most trades are bought to open. That's the assumption. I have, as you saw in those Google results. I do have a video that talks about Max Payne. And it reviews a bunch of the research. I don't want to spend a ton of time on it. But I do think the close from Friday is at least worth a discussion point on it. So I'll slide this out of the way",

But I do think the close from Friday is at least worth a discussion point on it. So I'll slide this out of the way just for now. And we can see that we close that 2799. So here's the world of Max Payne at a high level. It's very difficult to prove. There's a lot of research out there that points in different directions. This isn't research that's done by market itself. It's typically done by different kinds of schools and educational institutions. And they see slightly different things. From a logical perspective, there is an incentive there. And anytime there is an incentive in financial markets for potentially somebody's benefit, you have to take it seriously. I think because the only reason why all of us are in markets is to make money. So all of that being said, there is a propensity for options to somehow draw the price of the underlying where Max Payne exists. Now there's a couple things to know about Max Payne. Let me see if I can grab it. I think it's from unusual wails. I think they have a tool for that. Let me see. No. No. I can't afford the specific plots that I'm trying to find. No, no, no.

And I think most of you guys are familiar with this one. Of Rointit says we've been saying that for a while. Yeah, no, I this isn't new ground. There's an important point behind this though. Because one of the things that retail traders I find tend to do is they automatically think Max Payne is causing essentially all movement around expiration. And the problem with that is a few things. So first things first. If we take a look at these different strike prices. One of the things that's going to have to happen naturally in the options chain as time passes is we are going to ebb and flow where Max Payne is. Max Payne is not static.

So Max Payne is almost always going to be near the money. Almost not always, but almost the reason is because that's where options are most liquid. And that tends to be where traders are transacting are front expiration near the money. So it creates a near self fulfilling prophecy where stock price tends to follow around move around where Max Payne seems to be. But the options market is moving in the background also trading around where stock price is. So the important element here is to know Max Payne is not static. If we take a look at Max Payne today and we track it against what it is at expiration, it will be different. That's an important note. Pretty much half to track it. So this would show Max Payne. It's kind of hard to tell it's so skewed. That's actually really interesting how skewed it is. Does this show. That's kind of a bummer. I thought they had a thing that showed it like day by day. That would I think be really, really helpful for people to see like how it moves. But Max Payne will move. Now that part aside, the other element to know for the market making perspective is market makers have the ability to move price. And much is difficult to say. It's",

Now that part aside, the other element to know for the market making perspective is market makers have the ability to move price. And much is difficult to say. It's very difficult to quantify. In order for them to move price. Options do not lead the market. Options are derivatives. The value of an option is derived from the underlying. So that's options positions depending on who holds them. Sometimes will include hedging activity. That includes the underlying itself. So that line becomes muddled a little bit. So. When we have a stock in a situation like GameStop. And we have the ability for the stock to either land at 28 or 27.99. Literally a one penny difference. A market maker or group of market makers might be able to force price down by selling a bunch of shares. Just to dip the price down a little bit. It's easier said than done. And it's more applicable to smaller price movements. One of the things I see people say is, oh, they didn't want it to land in 30. So they pushed it down from 30. I'm not saying whether they did or didn't. I couldn't prove it to you either way. That's why I wouldn't say whether they did or didn't. I don't know.

But what I can tell you is the further away it is, the harder it becomes for an entity to try and manipulate price in that way. Because if market consensus is for whatever reason, market consensus thinks the stock should be 30. And then a group of market makers start trying to offload and sell shares or whatever they can get their hands on to try to drive price down. But the market is like, wait a minute, this is easily worth 30. I'm going to buy it here. I'm going to keep buying it here. That will add buy side pressure to counteract that push down. There's a limit to how far price can be manipulated in this way. When something is moved by a penny, that's not that fucking hard to do. It's very, very realistic. If the stock could have closed at 28 versus 27. 99. I absolutely would expect there to be a large group of interested participants, market makers, that would rather see this at 27. That is not as big of a move that they need to try to facilitate. And here's what I mean by this. If we take a look at the daily volume, the daily volume was 6.8 million shares.

If we take a look at the daily volume, the daily volume was 6.8 million shares. Let's grab our little, a little dude dad here. So 6.8. For 6.5. Sorry. 6.581. 6,5181. 586. And then let's just say that the mid price on this around would be 28 and a half. Something like that. We can calculate what the total value is that moved on the day. This is essentially just a V-wap. So 6.5. 81.5. 8.6. Times 28.5. 187,575,201. Now that's the total amount of volume on the day. With smaller stocks like this, moving this from 28, 27,99 is a pretty small move. So even though the total volume on the day, let's just call it was 188 million in terms of price and value, in order to move this by a penny, it still requires a subset of this and not an insignificant subset of this. We can actually do the math, but it doesn't matter quite that much. The point to be aware of is that market makers are incentivized to have more options expire worthless. If there's a way for them to collude together or with other entities to drive price down by a penny, which is the difference between several thousand options expiring in or out of the money, they're incentivized to do so.

So I don't know. That being said, there's a difference between this scenario and then the people that say, well, it should have been at 30, but market market makers manipulated it down to 27.99.

I'm not saying that it couldn't be done, especially if it's broader spread collusion and stuff like that easier to detect. There's a lot of risk involved in doing that, especially if they're trying to short it and then there's some sort of meteoric rise for some reason or another.

The problem like we're talking about those that when it's bigger, when it's a big gap, when we're talking about like five dollars, that's difficult to attach an assigned Max pain to. And then it looks like we have somebody from Bulgaria. Let's get Bulgaria on our map. We just we got Bulgaria rep in the set. That's kind of crazy. You all have fucking Z's and threes.

So I would decouple those in that scenario because they're definitely different things. Okay. I'm getting caught up. Rowan city says it depends who the options chain is loaded up. Yeah, I would it depends how the option chain is loaded up exactly. So I would just decouple the concept of Max pain from a gamma squeeze. They're just different functions. They do different things from a Max pain perspective. The market makers are absolutely incentivized to have as many options expire out of the money worthless as possible. Assuming that they are the ones that sold the options to whoever bought them, which is a completely fair and safe assumption. That's objectively the case. They're incentivized to do something like that. So from from that function, the purpose of Max pain is to save them some hedging cost because they're not going to make the money or not based on Max pain. They still made their money. They make the money on the bid ask spread. It's just can they make a little bit more money, which they can, which is why they're incentivized to do so. But Max pain like the",

It's just can they make a little bit more money, which they can, which is why they're incentivized to do so. But Max pain like the Max pain has a constraint because it requires quite literal collusion in order to push price. Because if you have a stock that's doing 200 million of volume in a day, in order for you as the participant, in this case, the market maker, to try and push the price down, you're going to have to put up a percentage of that total daily volume. In order to make a meaningful move in the price. So that's why smaller moves are entirely feasible because it's very expensive and it's a big risk for them to carry it. But if it's a smaller move, it's easier to carry that risk. But if we're talking like China's suppressed price, 5 as a market maker, that's much, much more difficult, much, much more difficult. Espionore Wall says I've seen price move aggressively in the last hour today to get to Max pain, assuming it was unhidged calls that expire at the close could also be self fulfilling of traders or watch your Max pain.

The second thing that you're seeing is as the last hour of the day is going, you have to remember Max pain come towards the end of the day on expiration day is going to be close to at the money. It's going to be close more often than not. That's not to say that it's guaranteed, but it's going to be close.

So you don't start exercising before the close because you don't know where it's going to close. So notice says not necessarily collusion many people doing the same thing, look in the same direction, synthesize to move in the same direction. But that's the thing is like the participants and the options buyers are not incentivized to look in the correct direction. The reason why I would wager its collusion more than anything for Max pain to work is because if you had one market maker on any, any style of frequency on Friday towards the end of the, because everything on their books is tracked. It's not hidden. So if you have one market maker that happens to be towards the very end of the day selling five million dollars worth of GameStop shares short to push the price down a penny, that's going to stick out like a sore fucking thumb.

I don't think it's in the case of something that's like at the money, which is an important differentiation. Okay, so the section that it provides a detailed analysis of the short interest percent based on various data points calculations. The analysis includes references to other users post data such as deep in the money call options and their impact on synthetic shares. The other estimates that the current short interest percentage for GME is significantly higher than publicly reported figures exceeding 200 of the float. Section emphasized the complexity and potential manipulation of the market highlighting challenges and accurately determining true short interest. I mean, that sounds right to me. I think that that's also something that we've taken a look at before. So yeah, I completely dig that. I think there's no no issue from my side with with any of that. I dig it.

Out of the money puts used to hide short interest. This is no effect on price of GME because it's not being exercised and they maintain. I even until expiration shortage are using these to hide short interest from the world. The main counter argument to the molasses their short interest is 20 they covered. So if you're shorter and you hide your short interest, you can push that narrative. And hope people. Check out how short. Short interest percent drops when put. Oh, I rock it.

When the market is going through an anomalous period like a lot of this stuff. It's I just I think it's. It's disingenuous to make very defined statements about correlation and causation. And like I I don't think that they've connected any dots as far as I'm concerned. They've connected and identified relationships potentially. But I don't see an explanation for the relationships, right? They're they're saying. That they're used by larger for out of the money calls. They're used by larger players who want a profit. The ones were purchased expire on 16 July 21 might be hoping for like it just. Not really to me it looks more so like they're just kind of explaining their version of things as they think they see it, which is okay. But when I'm reading especially due diligence, I'm trying to find like researched back connections to stuff, which a lot of these have a lot of. Which is why I'm applying that one.

And then re engage them if they were inclined to maintain the position. Now I also think that there's a reality to your point, Roy and Titty that there absolutely could have been entities that were starting to short the stock when it was a dollar. And they got ran over so hard that they'd rather just hold the position. But there is a cost to hold those open shorts. You can't find a free short because even from like say for example, if you try to short a stock on your brokerage platform, you obviously have to borrow the stock. And then you have to borrow the stock. And you pay a rate because you're borrowing something that you don't own. Now obviously the relationship will be completely different with the way that institutions can short they can set up swaps and things like that.

I like my guess is that the constitutions of the shorts would be very different. And the way that the shorts are managed would be very different. And that's one of the things that confounds me a little bit when I read through the different DD because it always looks like we're looking at it from one perspective. That's actually what begged the question here because as I'm reading this, it still looks like we're continuing to think of the shorts as universal all short all in the same boat. And I actually don't think that's likely to be the case because the way that different entities would short would look slightly different. And then I think the way that they would maintain the short would also look different because the game of satisfying FTDs from a market making perspective is really important. Obviously, which is why a lot of them would likely find ways to satisfy FTDs so that they don't pop up on right show and stuff like that that becomes a problem in a threat to the business.

But for hedge funds, they probably have different ways of maintaining and holding the position and hedge funds are really the ones that would probably be more involved in the seller boxing side of things and actually trying to press price down to zero. So that I just think is a bit of a breakdown from some of what I've seen here. Rointit, he says there's there's a difference between covering and closing and I think a lot of I would agree with that and I think a lot of retail doesn't understand that.

She knows a lot about these things and students to use work for the DTCC. Yeah, I think and I think we've looked at some of her her work before. She's. I'm trying to see if she has a website or something maybe her blog looks like she's working for an advisory firm right now. Wait, is this the right naked short greedy. Yeah, okay, cool.

There are any three views on what is about to happen the entire system and banks are going to go belly up because the scenario described everything short DD. I think so.

So it looks like they're talking about people positioning for some sort of like big drop or collapse, but for some market makers to provide liquidity, so you want a bunch of IGX, yeah, okay. You might be thinking of the DD highlighting more and buff it dump any stocks over the last year, we keep in mind and dumps airline stocks. So they're talking about like the expectation of defaults.

So unless GameStop is a stock, just went directly up into the right, which we know it didn't, there's no way for him to actually build the wealth that he built by just buying and holding it. And we can see that that wasn't his game plan from the beginning because we went through every single one of his trades and from the very onset he used options. So you don't use options unless you're trading. That's why Nancy Pelosi obviously is out there slaying an option. Okay. Johnny says he could build wealth by selling calls against the shares. No, he couldn't. Absolutely could not. One, because we can see all the way back through all of his original portfolio updates, there was never a short call in there. But more importantly, short calls at the scale that he hit absolutely could bring him money, but it's not going to build you wealth. Short calls, they're defined profit by their nature.

Because if the primary profit mechanism that we're talking about is a short squeeze or a gamma squeeze or some sort of squeeze, a big price movement, but then there's no expectation to sell, you're unable to monetize the price movement. It's just an unrealized gain that sits there and that doesn't ultimately help you buy more shares or do whatever the ultimate objective is or take your money out and use that to change your family's life whatever the ultimate objective is. So that's been a pretty consistent breakdown as far as I can see with the logic of people that are hoping for some sort of squeeze, but then they don't have at least some sort of exit plan in place to monetize it. Because otherwise you can go through the short squeeze, but then you might emerge at the other end, which is cool, but you might emerge at the underend with no more or less money than what you started with, which is, I don't know, I think that that would be the not not the objective.

New retail had no idea how any of this worked and behaved. That's what would happen. So the diamond forever not understanding the marketing mechanics. And that's, I completely agree because especially for the people that are talking about like buy a whole DRS, that's fine too. But the main thing is for those kinds of people, if you do that, you don't monetize the move. And that's why like the move here from 14 up to 64, you can make a lot of money on it. You can make a lot of money on it.

But if you buy and hold and your shares are DRS, you've essentially made, which still isn't bad by the way, but like you essentially would have made that, what, nine in change and you're sitting at 28 now. But you had an exit point here to be, Shit. From, I mean, there's just so many potential exit points for somebody that was getting in pre-squeez here. So yeah, it's just, that's a long holding period from here to here to go from five or nine and then to be sitting at 28 after four years or five years. When all of these individual spikes can be monetized. And I mean, you guys, I keep it completely straight with you guys. I hold shares just as a play of solidarity with the apes. But it's a very small subset of my total capital. And what I do mostly with GameStop is I trade the movements because it moves really well. And there's a lot of ways to again, monetize the movements, but buying and holding, especially something like this, it will take a little bit of time. I think the company looks good. I think the prospects of the company turning around are really strong. But I do think that the company is positioned well. But that kind of stuff still takes time to eventually come to the surface, which that's what people will have to",

But that kind of stuff still takes time to eventually come to the surface, which that's what people will have to be willing to hold through. And even that, they need to have an exit plan in order to eventually make the money because otherwise it just sits as an unrealized game, which is cool to have, but that doesn't pay bills. And that's not the thing that will ultimately change somebody's life, they'll want to find ways. Even if it's one of the easiest ways things can do is take partial profits. I'm in the process of making a couple different videos for GameStop on how to essentially trade a stock like GameStop with some different strategies to give people ideas. But even if you want to buy and hold in DRS, some of your shares, you can have some of it that you're actively moving in and out of. To then slowly accumulate more shares in your base share position or something like that. There's different things folks can do, but I just want to see people be able to hit their objectives because I know a really big part of the GameStop community and the apes is people are looking for a change in their lives.

They're literally looking for something to lead to a significant change in their current life, scenario, their life perspective, the situation that they're in. And I want to see people be able to do that because trading has unequivocally done that for me. Like it literally has done that exact thing for me. So I know it can be done, but I also know that you kind of have to think through what you're trying to do in order to get the outcome you're looking for. So I hope people can continue finding their way there. I really, really do. We'll see, but I'm bullish on people's ability to learn and grow especially with everything that's available now. I think the retail trader and the standard ape that exists now are continuing to get really fucking smart. And I think that that just bodes well for what they will eventually be able to do. We will see time as always will tell. All right, gang, that wraps me up for today. As always, if you need anything, hit me up in the discord. And I will see you guys during one of the live sessions.
