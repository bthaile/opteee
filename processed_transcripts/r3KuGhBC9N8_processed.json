But I always find the market's ability to find small quirks like that, entertaining. So the agenda for today will be pretty quick, actually. I want to walk through the market at a high level and maybe discuss a little bit about the recent upcoming, specifically the tariff side of stuff, we're actually going to spend time on the pro stream tomorrow digging quite a bit deeper into the tariffs. That will be our deep dive topic because I think there's a lot of ways to play the tariff news. Everything from the volatility of the tariffs to the implementation, the industry impacts. And I think the volatility for the tariffs is going to continue to be like really, really important. And it's because the tariffs continue to evolve and morph as we go forward. So because of that uncertainty, you typically can find some volatility to trade around those kinds of events. So that's the game plan. Let's get us on to the main screen. Futures on the open right now down a little bit, VIX up a little bit, not much. We're seeing it peaked above 22 today and it's clustering so far around 21. We'll see how it behaves in here.

We'll see how it behaves in here. But if we take a quick look at SPX and I specifically want to eyeball the volatility here. So I have actually no idea why these are messed up right now. It doesn't really matter because we can go in and we can manually get an idea of what Volis. So it looks like the at the money is like 31 and a half. And then this side is like 25. So definitely at the money on the put side elevated, which would what we would expect. You can see it's really not that elevated around the two April dates. And obviously that's when we're expecting the tariffs to go live. So because of that, the standard suite of vault trading strategies is really the primary direction. I've been playing stuff like this. I don't have anything in particular on for two April just yet. But probably as it gets a little closer, we'll look to do that. Now let's take a quick look at the broad market. There's a couple key themes to highlight from today. The first one is take a look at energy. Energy had a pretty strong day.

That's where people were rotating into things like energy, staples, utilities. We could see that rotation happening. Now with the market rallying today, right? So you can see SP 500 had a positive day closing above yesterday's close. The cues about tied, not a big move in the cues comparatively and then same sort of scenario with the Russell. But you'll notice that these are the stocks that people have been rotating into on weakness. Now the fact that these still rally today while the rest of the market still saw strength should tell you something very specific. It should tell you that people are continuing to rotate into XLE, XLP, XLU. And when I'm referring to those, I don't necessarily mean those tickers specifically, but the sectors that they represent. So that story is important for you to keep in the back of your mind.

And it has everything to do with the injection of uncertainty around what we're seeing from tariffs. And you can also see it reflected in a couple different ways. One of the ways is the really, really soft call premiums on the day. And then if we filter this to look at the out of the money's only, then it's about a soft as it possibly could be. So because that, and we're seeing this really persistent, heavier put premium on a relative basis, but notice what's happening right now. You can see that both puts and call premiums are kind of lame today, right? Not really seeing a whole lot. What's that all about? The holding pattern. What's happening right now is the market is essentially saying, I don't really know what's going on. I don't really know what's set to happen on the second. So this shows a lot of participants moving into a cash position, at least partially, to wait and see what's going to happen. And we can also see this reflected in the repo markets. So this kind of positioning is very common around stuff like this, especially for larger players, because it takes time for larger players to build their positions.",

So this here, completely logical, it doesn't surprise me at all. And it wouldn't surprise me that if we don't have some sort of larger news come out tomorrow in some capacity to see this trend this way into the second. The other thing that's worth noting is actually from here, the COT report. So if you take a look at the COT report, there's an important trend to identify here. Take a look at large speculators. What happened today for large speculators, if I move this into a one year, so it's a little easier to see, what do you notice, large speculators is the green line plummeted. So while the market rallied a little bit today, large speculators largely exited future positions, specifically this one in SP. So this is all floating into the small element of residual strength that we saw today. And yet again, an important context clue. This is the game of trading. The game of trading is understanding what typically happens when and then identifying conditions that start to vary from that.

And we talked about that exact function. And it's because that's a really significant part of what we do as traders is we monitor what tends to happen. And then when other things happen, they stick out to us. This is one of them. The market rallying like it did today and seeing the pretty strong unwind from speculators is important to keep in mind. But it tells us is that they're not fully buying the rally. And this is obviously an expectation of continued downside, which I still think broadly is likely going to be the case, at least in the near term until we get through the rest of the whole tariff scenario. So that's what I'm seeing from a broader sector lens. A couple of things that drew my eye, the overall breadth looks bad. So if we take a look at net highs lows, you can see exactly the game that's going on today for the NASDAQ, the net is negative 642, which is about the largest it's been. And then if we take a look at the New York Stock Exchange, it's negative 228, which again,",

The last time it was at that was on the third of March, which is this day up here. So market breadth here looks weak. Now funny enough, Trin is starting to look healthy. It's another breadth indicator. I still wouldn't consider this healthy yet, but this is really tied also partially to what you're seeing from something like the skew index here. Which is funny enough, not as excessive as we might have thought if the market was really gearing up for a potential like significant unwind. So Joey says Tommy says large spec strapped off. That's exactly right. Good eyeball on that. Joey says with such large amounts of uncertainty, why is the move in VIX relatively muted? Well, because it's, I mean, it's not muted. That's the thing. It's just we're not in an environment where VIX would be excessively elevated necessarily. But if you take a look at where VIX is today, like this isn't muted by any stretch of the imagination.

I don't think it's, I don't think it's excessive either, but I don't think it's muted. Derek good to see you. Jesse says question. Newton said, GME's short interest is 99 in his video this morning. What's your opinion? I don't really think there's an opinion on that, right? Like I think we can just look up short interest and see what it is. So let's take a look. GME short interest. I can tell normally has this. This has seven percent of float with point eight two days to cover, which is actually a little lighter than I would have expected. Let's try one other resource. We'll take a look at market beat. They say 7.2. And let's check out, oops, one more. Take a look at Benzingo. Benzingo shows short interest at 7.5. So typically what I",

So typically what I do in these is I kind of just eyeball the difference between them and pick something towards the middle as long as there's not a massive change. So it looks like it'd be in like the mid-sevens as far as I'm concerned in terms of short interest as percent of float. Not really sure the context Jesse on short interest being 99. I didn't catch that video. Based on the data that we have available, that doesn't look to be the case. It looks like it's actually single digits, which does seem a little low to me. But it's also really hard to tell with all the synthetics and stuff available. So there's probably a little more context behind the statement that I just don't have. So yeah. Anyways, this is frozen. Let's unfreeze. So Jesse says watch his video that he made his morning. I probably won't to be honest with you, but yeah, I don't have anything against watching his videos.

So there was a couple people asking, there was a couple people asking, oh wait, hold on. H says I was a bit confused by where Newton got the 99 number as well to be honest. I'm assuming, again, without the context, I would assume he's guessing that from including all of the derivatives, market on top of it, which I mean, honestly, it's not really how that works, but I could see why he might look at it that way if he's looking at it that way. But I don't see really a way to get to 99 short flow unless you have derivatives involved without derivatives. Right now, at least, I don't see the data, the back it up. So that would be my assumption. H is that he likely is talking about derivatives. But if you drop a comment on his video, he'll probably tell you he's he's pretty responsive.

It hit a low of 5488, which is a not trivial move. But then it rallied. So then the question people are trying to understand now is why did it rally? So let's start there. Why do you think it rallied? And while you're answering that, I'm going to open the window and pop the door for Thor. What do we think? Why did rally? Oh, interesting. Tommy, what did Tom Lee say? I didn't catch what he said. Tommy is saying rally people listen to Tom Lee. I'm pretty sure he's on the Bloomberg. I don't know where NBC. I mean, if I list enough, one of them will be correct. Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Finance, final answer Yahoo Finance. William says the bottom in, in again, is in again. You mean that's what he was saying?

That's true. We absolutely do not know what the tariffs will ultimately look like. Now what is worth noting is that we have an idea. And the reason why we have an idea is because Trump has talked about a lot of it. Now obviously, Tom Lee here is a little more nuanced than that, right? So he's not suggesting that nobody knows it's just kind of completely out in the open. Like it doesn't mean that here. He's talking way more nuanced. And he's essentially saying like what the actual implementation is going to look like, which I do agree with. I think we don't know that. And that is a big part of the uncertainty we have right now. They don't know if it's going to damage the economy. And I think third many. That I think we do know.

We know this. So even after the announcement, I don't think that the announcement and implementation of the tariffs is it's so funny when people do this. Take a journey with me from the start of the tariffs, which the tariffs have already started in part. Do you think that the path of the tariffs that have already been implemented was super streamlined and everybody knew what was going on? I imagine most of you would argue no because that would be my argument as well because an objective analysis of how it happened shows that it was not that that there was always the persistence of willingness to have ancillary deals. So this idea that once the tariffs come out on the second, that everything is just going to be clear, everybody's going to know what's going on and it's just going to be smooth sailing from there.

Trump is going to be receptive to that because he's already shown some level of receptiveness to that. The only point I'm making here is that once the tariffs launch on the second, it's not like this is all clear and we know what's up. It's just not the case. We are going to have a layer of clarity at least in the near term, but the long term uncertainty isn't just going to evaporate here. So I just think that that's a massive miss. I don't want to say misunderstanding because I mean, people like this are really smart and I would never, I would never position it as if they don't know what they're talking about because they do. I just think it's like a different perspective",

You're just a little terrified of the policies of the White House, but like that right there, right? He's saying that there's certain entities that are terrified of the policies of the White House. Well, like that's not gone after two April. Just keep that in mind. Post Wednesday, I think markets are going to have some visibility and that allows us to take some of the selling pressure off. So. I don't understand that. I don't understand that. And the reason for the long pause there is I'm trying to game theory in my mind. Like does Tom Lee have some sort of vested interest to share this kind of message versus another message? I don't know enough about him in his background and what he does to immediately put that together. But I don't see how you draw those two conclusions or like that conclusion from the prior statement.

But that's the thing is my what I'm saying is that there is no less certainty. It's not going to change. It's not like to April comes certainty goes down. It doesn't. I actually would argue in certain instances certainty will go up because one of the big things that we don't know yet is how are all of our trading partners going to respond. And I argue that's an even bigger level of uncertainty than what's being captured in the implementation of the tariffs, which we know is overwhelmingly likely to occur. So it's not like we're going into this with a 50 50 coin flip of do tariffs go on or do they not go on? That's really not the question that we have here at all. Really the question that we have in front of us is what do the tariffs look like in their implemented form, which is a fair question. And then that is uncertain and there will be more certainty on that post Wednesday. I think that that's absolutely the case.

You're still confusing it, man, because one of the things that just because there's a deadline doesn't mean that post deadline, we we now know what's going on. Joe says, but if we are being that broad, tariffs can go up or down in or out at any time. That's exactly correct. And we don't know that level and we won't know how the trading partners will respond. So yeah, what I'm saying here is I don't think that post to April that there's no certainty gained. We obviously do gain a little bit of certainty because notice how I said even early with the implementation of tariffs. The question right now isn't to April tariffs are going to be implemented. That's the overwhelming consensus. But there could be something that even if it's 99 expected right now, there could be a one percent chance that they're not implemented for some sort of reason, right? So there still is uncertainty around their implementation. It's just broadly expected. Now the main thing that he's talking about here though is that once the",

This is why I don't listen to this stuff, to be honest. It's because like talking heads like this, they have to come up with a neat narrative and markets are simply not neat. Markets have so much going on that the urge that most traders have to bubble this stuff up to a really neat, clean, discrete tagline on what happened and what that led to.

Fundamental question that people are sitting around trying to figure out today and tomorrow. That's right. That's a great question, by the way. Effectively, what he's saying is answer. Yes or no, what do you really think here? It's an interminable wait for people because it is still three days and they're fearful that we could have three days of down 2. But I kind of agree with that. That in and of itself, in my opinion, would tell you a lot. And it also tells you that the market was up today. So it's not like three days of down 2 at this point. They were thinking that because you could tell where it was at the time. The market was down a little bit. The thing that's going on here is they're trying to understand what the move might look like. And that's natural, right? He's",

He's essentially saying, well, what do we think for the person that's trying to pull the trigger and make a decision here? We'd be thinking. Drew with Larry Fink, I think the US is going to come out of this. Okay. Fully agree. I think that's absolutely the case. I am insanely bullish on the US pretty much always. And that's not because I just am like a blind dude that just loves our country. I do love our country and I am patriotic. But I'm also hypercritical of things. The reason why I'm insanely bullish is because we are eternal innovators and we continue to innovate repeatedly. And I think that that's ultimately what drives the expansion of productivity and value that we appreciate here. And I do think that we're on the precipice of a series of like literally globe changing innovations through things like AI. So super bullish, longer term. I mean, Brexit's an example. Brexit happened and the UK economy emerged. Okay, it didn't have a huge recession and the stock market did okay.

Just as I give him the benefit of the doubt and I think he's smart. I also think the economists are smart and I don't think economists would look at this and just simply say, well, how is this going to hurt and disrupt things? I think they also likely are going to look at the longer term effects of it depending on how it goes. The problem with tariffs is that it is a very delayed feedback system. The fact that the feedback loop is so delayed makes it very difficult because to the defense of the economists that he might be referencing here, the near term impacts largely are negative across the board. Now does that lead to longer term positive impacts?

I argue in certain industries it will, but in other industries like we talked about during the pro market prep live stream yesterday, for example, the automotive industry. If you think about the standard margins for an automotive company, it's 10 if they're good. If you have 25 tariffs and let's say a part is made in the US, but then it's shipped to Mexico and then back to the US or shipped to Canada and then back to the US, which does happen, for add on infrastructure or I'm sorry, add on the fuck is the word I'm looking at. It's like building. When you're refining whatever the part is, it'll typically go to different stages in different places. So if it goes across the Canada, hits a 25 tariff comes back to the US, also hits a tariff, that's a problem. Automotive companies literally do not have the margins to sustain that kind of thing. So it asks like that would be beyond catastrophic to that specific industry if it does indeed go that way. We don't know. Rates are down and gasoline's down and there could be some pull forwarded demand. So we might end up having better growth. So less stag and maybe the influx.

It's likely to be a pretty suppressed environment. Placian stuff is more distorting and so it's not a stack flationary. You've had the, some of your recent calls that turned out to be Prussian, bullish calls had to do with inflation because some of the numbers have at least given what Goldman Sachs had a half a point higher on the PCE than they thought previously and three and a half on the PCE. I mean, yeah, it's interesting because Goldman did raise their inflation forecast but then they're talking about more rate cuts. I know, which is because of growth concern. Yes.

It's to happen and when and where the terminal rate is likely going to be come end of year. So you can see that there's one cut here, one cut here and then potentially another cut here. So the futures market is talking about potentially three cuts. The fed is talking one to two. So there's a little bit of bond market calling the bluff of the fed. And you can see what I found even more interesting is how it gets a frenic. The probabilities have been specifically for March. It has been fascinating to watch. And this is not something I've been trading, although it is something that I do historically trade is essentially the pairs between these. But it's been so schizophrenic that I haven't touched it when it's more of a defined trending thing I can, but when it's literally as chaotic as this, it's very difficult for me to do anything.

I wouldn't say don't ever listen to it because you can learn a lot by understanding the different relationships of things that people like that might talk about, but always remind yourself that they don't know any better than you do. Okay, now to do that exact thing, a lot of people were wondering about the rally that we saw today because the market did start super soft. And there's pretty good evidence of what I'm about to tell you is not that same scenario where we're just kind of talking out of our ass because we can look at the movement today. You can see really when the positive move started to happen, which is in here, right? Because",

You can see really when the positive move started to happen, which is in here, right? Because leading into this, it's still in the gap down. But then you can see as we get out into this range, it's actually in a pretty decent rally up and out from this point. So let's take a look at spy, which will give us some volume metrics. And this is important. The reason why the volume metrics here in spy are important is because as you know, as a practitioner of markets, you know that typically you're going to see volume spike beginning of day and end of day. That's where we have open outcry. We have a lot of auctions going and this is where liquidity typically is provided. However, you'll notice here what happened here, middle of the day, typically quiet going back to what I was talking to you about before that a big part of being a trader is looking for things that just look different. And this does look different. So let's do, I don't want it today. We won't sec. I want a one day. So if we take a look at the move here, it absolutely started to expand.

And the timing for this happened to coalesce when we were having some data released, which is particularly why it happened. And we'll take a look at that data now here. So the Chicago business, they have a PMI that they put out and their PMI actually came in pretty healthily. We can see that it was expected at 45.4. The prior was 45.5 and it was expected, obviously, to be about flat down a little bit. And it actually popped. And this is a 16 month high for this. So this started, I believe, to move the market a little bit. And then I think there was a couple other things that likely coalesced at the same time. But I actually do want to hone in on this Chicago PMI because there's some pretty interesting takeaways from this. I'm just getting caught up on the chat. Tommy says recession would force Fed hands. That depends. It really does depend. I do think that if a lot of thoughts obviously go through my head that like there's a strong argument that we're in a recession literally right now.

I do think that if a recession, whether or not we're in one now barred, if it does start to accelerate and look a little more aggressive, then it would not surprise me in the least to see the Fed have to position themselves to do something. And that's a big part of the central banks essentially. But I think it really depends on what the recession looks like and how things are. Because again, there is a genuine argument that we're sitting in a recession right now. It's we can observe the growth of GDP. We can look at the forecast of GDP. So yeah. Anyways, let's click through this a little bit. So you can see that it ran up to 47.6. It's the third consecutive monthly gain and it's the highest since November of 23. Although it's still in contraction territory. Just looks a little healthier than it did prior. Now you can see that the move generally came from the production side of things and then secondary movements from employment order backlogs and new orders and supplier deliveries contracting a little bit. So this is a pretty useful read for those",

What's happening right now is a lot of entities are trying to front run as much production as humanly possible ahead of the tariffs. So this general movement doesn't surprise me. We can see this hitting most of the expected affected industries. So I definitely think we'll see minor effects from that. You can see production like really ramped here. And I think a big part of that production also comes down to the anticipation and positioning for tariffs. So whether or not this production is actually something that sustains, I would wage your probably not to a degree.

I think it's down here, yeah, down here, 44 billion in October of 22. So sold it. A lot of people are crying like, oh, he just wanted to pay himself or owe this, owe that.

The other thing is that there was other money involved in that transaction. It's not like all his money, which is important. So if we take a look at why this might occur, I can see a significant number of really interesting reasons that I'm actually quite excited for because one of Musk's vision originally for X is for it to look a little bit more like we chat. And we chat from those that are unfamiliar. It's used in Asian countries, specifically places like China. And it's kind of like everything in one. It's messaging, it's social media, it's payments, it's Google searching. Well, their version of it's like everything is in that one app. So this I actually think starts to move X towards that path. And I also think that with the breadth of information that moves on X, you can already see it reflected in GROC, which is insanely proficient for what it is. I'm actually a pretty big fan of it. So I think the move here is interesting because it's likely to really accelerate a lot of what you're going to see in X AI, which is kind of fun. So that is just another interesting thing to keep an eye on. Tommy says I think he's using X AI to bail out on X and writing to the",

The thing to remember it, well, let's find out. Let's ask chat GPT, because I actually don't know the answer. So let's find out what percentage of the Twitter purchase was funded directly by Elon and what percentage was funded by other entities interested in the opportunity. I don't know the answer to this. Okay. So it's accurately identifying that it was acquired for 44 billion in October of 22. And it says the deal was structured using a blend of personal equity loans and outside investment. So Elon Musk's personal equity was 25 billion, which is 57. We co-investors 7.1 billion 16, which is Larry Ellison, Sequoia, Binance, Fidelity, bank loans, which is just good debt secured by Twitter's assets, not Musk's personal wealth was 13 billion. And then 1 billion came from margin loans. So the important point here. And again, this is why people don't, people like simple answers and explanations. People look at this and they think Elon Musk personally bought Twitter for 44 billion out of his pocket. And he has just over 50 of it. The other thing to keep",

It's the most frustrating thing on earth. All right. Okay, Google would have been faster than this. So what is Elon Musk's net worth? 342.9 billy as of 16 March.

I told you why because I think it's a massive accelerator for X AI to be able to use to be able to use X and also potentially to develop that ecosystem the way that he's talked about trying to develop the ecosystem. So yeah, I think from those lenses. TCM says 60 second thoughts on GME this week with the bond offer and potentially closing tomorrow. I don't really know. I haven't looked too closely. Let's see. Interesting that it's approaching this 20 and a half handle that we drew before. I mean, so the thing about the bond offering is it's not like at the market offering, right?

That's not so much the case here. So I think a lot of the initial response that you're seeing here is based on the pricing of the debt offering and then. The longer term prospects of game stop. But another thing that I do find slightly topical to be honest is that. The two standard deviation move bucket for the last six months is actually contracted a little. Interesting. Let's see what the options market say. Yeah, I mean, not much. Big call skew is per usual. Majority of call sold today. Yeah, this front expiration is actually really quiet. 150 to 53 actually is like super, super quiet. So the options market's not thinking much either. I don't really think that that's going to be necessarily a massive market moving event for for game stop. It's just have you ever looked at convertible bond arbitrage did a bit of digging over the weekend. It seems applicable to some of the action in GME. Well, I mean, I'm familiar with convertible bond are, but in when you say. Have you ever looked",
