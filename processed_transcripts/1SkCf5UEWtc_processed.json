    "text": "The Amazon 241 stock split went through today taking the stock from over a thousand dollars to now a hundred twenty four bucks after hours Awesome opportunity now if you're an investor timing probably doesn't matter too much if you like the stock share get him whenever you feel like it for traders though specifically me Now's not the time Although I am excited about the split makes it more accessible which is great. There's definitely heavy volume flowing into the stock really high volume today compared to the 70 day volume average despite all of that One year on a six month chart. It's in a downtrend so before I start going long products like this I like to wait for strength. It's exactly what I'm doing here. So for me it is a temporary pass Put it on the watch list see if there's a good reversal but until then not buy in even though it's interesting Got a stick to the plan catch you guys later",
