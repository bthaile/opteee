    "text": "Hands down, my favorite option strategy is the covered strangle. This video is going to go into exactly why and it's for two reasons. It's extremely adaptable to most market conditions and once you create a sound strategy around the covered strangle option structure, it allows you to benefit from different market forces in different market conditions. And I'll explain exactly why that's the case in just a minute. So what's up everybody? Eric here. Welcome back to all the outliers and a huge shout out to the Patreon members and YouTube members you guys make creating content like this possible for me. So thank you guys and if you enjoy my content consider signing up. Helps me a lot with that. Let's get right to it. Executive summary. So for those that don't know I'm really big into organization and I will throw a link in the notes below on the concept of trading plans and strategy outlines. This is kind of the excerpt of a strategy outline that walks through how I view the strategy, how I intend to deploy it. The executive summary is like the acid test. It's just an overview of what it is succinctly. So the covered strangle is designed to maintain market exposure. So I trade the covered strangle in almost every single market condition. It's primarily a bullish strategy. The market exhibits positive drift over a long term time frame. So it allows me to expose myself to that. But we can",

The market exhibits positive drift over a long term time frame. So it allows me to expose myself to that. But we can enhance the buy and hold return because one of the downsides of buying hold is when the market goes down. You lose out on a lot of opportunity and buy and hold because you just essentially have to get it by and hold. But in this case we can use options around a otherwise buy and hold strategy to really amplify the return potential. So what's the setup here? What does this thing actually look like? Well real simple really. It's going to start with a cash secured put then it's going to have long stock and then it's going to have a covered call. Let's take a quick look at each of those by themselves first. If we pull up the platform you can see a trade that I have on right now in IWM which is a covered strangle. And let's take a look at each of these individual legs. So first we have the cash secured puts. Cash secured puts will have limited profit potential. It's defined at the onset of the trade and technically undefined risk down to zero. Then we have the covered call. This part is actually really important first. It's going to start",

It's going to start with the long stock right. So long equity you've seen this before. It's just a positive sloping line for anybody that's looking at this chart saying what the hell is this? This is literally just a risk profile but it shows you your profit and loss at different stock prices. So the Y-axis is our PL and then the X-axis is the price in the underlying. So long stock it's just upward sloping right. You dollar for dollar you move with the underlying. Now right now I'm long 800 shares of IWM at 181 94. So covered call typically looks like this where if we have long 800 shares we would be short 8 calls against it and notice how we cap our upside potential. Now right now my covered call actually looks like this. Notice how it has unlimited upside potential. This is for a very particular reason. I do not sell short calls to long stock at a 1 to 1 ratio. Typically we'll get into different circumstances on what ratios you would want to use when but the guiding feature here is if I'm long 800 shares at 181 94 and I'm short six short calls at",

Typically we'll get into different circumstances on what ratios you would want to use when but the guiding feature here is if I'm long 800 shares at 181 94 and I'm short six short calls at 182 which is above my basis. I have 200 shares that are uncapped. That's why I do not have capped upside potential. One of the largest drawbacks of the covered call is capped upside potential. We accept some money upfront but then we give up our upside potential and a lot of times the stock will run and then you're like well damn it I'm missing out on a lot of gains for a little bit of a credit upfront. Say something god damn it you're on television. This allows us to create balance. So in this case if I want to unwind the position short I might sell 8 short calls against the long 800 shares in the hopes that all 800 get called away and I'm okay with that. But in other instances you can modulate how many short calls you sell and we'll get into what that trade-off looks like in a little bit. So those are the legs that's it. It's really not that complicated. So I want to run you through overall management real quick because I just gave you what the max profit and the max losses for each of those but let's take",

So I want to run you through overall management real quick because I just gave you what the max profit and the max losses for each of those but let's take a look at PL management. For the cash secure put I'm typically going to look at something around 65 max profit. I personally use a sliding scale that's IV adjusted days to expiration. I'm not going to go into that into this video because it really doesn't offer that big of an enhancement over this as a general approach. Then for the long stock normally I'm just going to use support and resistance using moving averages linear aggression channels kind of what you typically would do when you're trading. So whatever your overall approach is to managing long stock positions that's what I would apply here. Now the products I trade make this slightly different and in general I'm mostly going to be looking at taking profit when I want to unwind the position but I overall look at things like moving averages linear aggression channels because I don't want to ride things all the way down if I don't have to. We'll get into that in a little bit but overall that's what I'm looking at for the cash secure put and the long stock. For the covered call the profit is just going to be managed at whatever",

Great question let me show you so if we pull up this options chain let's say right now I have short puts out in 22 May if these fell in the money I could roll them out to 24 May add two days I can roll them out to 26 May to 30 May because of the weekly expirations I have a ton of choices because the trade off here is the further out in time you go the more money you collect but you start you have to wait longer first but you lose sensitivity what I mean by that is let's say instead I had these short puts out 41 days out and then they fall in the money quickly well the next roll I have available is 62 days then 90 days so instead of adding two days to the trade that I have to wait I'm now adding 30 at a clip so that's the trade off here the shorter term time frames you can trade typically I prefer you're going to get better theta decay but in low implied volatility environment slowly ascending markets it's difficult to do that now for rolling or rolling versus assignment a couple things to keep in mind for the short puts or the short calls the best time",
