But he's, he's happy to be here and he is ready to start talking about some options. He likes the condensation from like the, the cans. But he's very, he's very sleepy right now getting a lot of face licking. Good boy. I thought I'd let you guys see the man, the man of the hour. All right. Let's definitely, let's get my face out of the way. Nobody needs that in their life. All right. Let's talk about the game plan for today. I had a few things that I want to cover with you. But my hope is for me to cover them in a bit of an interactive style session. So my objective here is I want to work through with you this process of analyzing trade opportunities and then building a trade off of that. Now for a quick reminder, I wanted to start with the idea of kind of how to build a trade. We talked about this actually at length, not too long ago. And I'll leave it up here just for a moment. And before we get too far down the line here, you know that we got to say hello to everybody. So I see we got Anthony, E Long songs, grab a terrorist, Hater, Teddy, Reese, Anthony, Mick, Eric, it looks like Teddy. Teddy says,",

Teddy says, I really like your Vids, but you should drop the GME crap that's bad for people's brains. Honestly, I don't blame it. It's okay if you don't like it, don't tune into those videos then. That's all I got to say to that. If you talk about GME, I'm outy. Yeah, that's totally cool. You should, you should bounce at any point that's no skin off my back. And I think that that's a completely fair, fair structure. So Teddy goes, this guy's my hero. I love this dude, but no more GME. Unfortunately, homie, there's going to be more GME. Now that's not really the focus of today's session, right? So the focus of today's session is outlier, option straight in for beginners. So I absolutely segment what I do. But yeah, that's totally okay. If that's not your bag. For me, I've talked about GME enough to, I think for most people to understand my interest in it and why I like exploring it.

Wow. AXHAT Rastogi. Big fan of that name shout out to you. They're roaring titties not here. Otherwise, I would honestly have to say I still prefer that over AXHAT, but AXHAT is not that far off. All right. Anthony saying, how do the breaks on the vet feel? The vet is still being worked on, actually, I can show you the latest picture from right now. I'm installing a much larger catch can because it really needs it. I don't know how well this is going to come through. Let me change this really fast so that you could see. It might be difficult to see, but that's inside the passenger wheel well. You can see the red is the caliper right there. Then this is the new catch can.

We also got Shrej a great to see you. All right. So let's talk about this in a theoretical sense to start. I just want to talk about this idea of building a trade. What that approach looks like. And then we'll look through some. Roing titty. What's up Roing titty man? I'm stoked to see you. I always love seeing that name. It's the best name I think ever on planet earth. Also, the latency should be way better now because I have it updated so that it's a more real time, which is my preference anyways, to be completely honest. All right. Building a trade. So one of the issues I see traders very, very regularly make when this trying to construct a trade is I think they start from a compromised position.

And then I'm going to base the conversation though around the idea of building trades. So my hope is a little bit later in the video. I want you guys to share tickers that you're looking at. And we literally can walk through analyzing them together. Because I think there's good experience to be gained there. But we have to start from the beginning, I think. And the beginning in my opinion is thinking through how a portfolio operates. There's a video coming out soon actually that goes through most of these in detail. Yes, I have to add that to my dictionary is do people not use skill set as one word. I thought that that was like pretty standard. Anyways, so I want to talk about the primary generation modality for a trade at least in my view. It starts with looking at the portfolio.

I look at the portfolio and the way it's behaving requires an adjustment in terms of how it aligns with my disposition. The portfolio needs adjustments because some of the trades in the portfolio need to be adjusted, whether it's due to hitting P and L targets, whether it's due to being in the trade long enough, whether it's due to an event is coming up that I don't want to be exposed to those kinds of things. I can also have just an opportunity that I come across. So the way to think about for me at least the origin of searching for a trade, it starts at the portfolio. And the genesis of it is does the portfolio need something in particular? Or am I just going shopping for opportunity because I need to add some risk? But the reason why I started the portfolios is because it naturally sends me down different paths that naturally limits my scope of selection. So I'm not trying to solve this giant problem of there's thousands of things I can trade. How do I pick one? So we can work through in detail how that process flows.

    "text": "I'm not trying to solve this giant problem of there's thousands of things I can trade. How do I pick one? So we can work through in detail how that process flows. So let's start with the portfolio. If we have a portfolio or if I have a portfolio and let's say that there's no specific portfolio need, meaning I look at the portfolio and it's operating as I want. I don't necessarily need to take risk off or add more. It's right now what I'm highlighting is the ability to be very opportunistic in what I'm searching for. So if we're being opportunistic, we need to make sure that what we're looking for fits in the portfolio. And that's all based on disposition. So let's literally look at the market as it sits now and come up with that. So as we come over here to the chart and we take a quick look at the market, my disposition is right now is we're coming into a bit of a consolidation. And I think that the market is still up heavy on the year. I think that the market ran very, very heavy. And I think the market was due for a pullback of some type. And I think we're starting to see it. Now the quality of that pullback is different because I see the pullback is drastically impacting tech. We can see this move in tech is very pronounced. We can see the SP 500 is holding",

We can see this move in tech is very pronounced. We can see the SP 500 is holding up a little bit better. And we can see that the Russell is actually selling off really, really hard comparatively. So this has been a fascinating move from the Russell. Like one of the the like the craziest things I think I've ever seen where over the course of two weeks, it was up almost 20 and now it's coming back down almost the same, not quite. This is a massive change. Now a lot of this dovetails off of what we talked about or what I talked about, I should say, on the recap video earlier today. So my goal is not to go through and rehash all of that. If you have specific questions, happy to answer them. But I don't think we have to kind of rehash all of that. I'm just kind of giving you a general layout of how I'm viewing the market right now. So as I think about looking for opportunities, I then can say, do I have a disposition? Do I want to trade stuff that's going to add bullish delta to the portfolio, bearish delta to the portfolio. So you guys tell me, what are we looking for? Pick whatever you",

I have a friend there that sends these to me. And this is nectarine and citrus. Big fan, the orange one I think is might be my favorite. All right. So I got to be honest, this looks about unanimous that everybody's looking for bearish delta, which doesn't surprise me. I think what most of you are experiencing, is what's very, very common. And what's common is people don't necessarily do a great job trading things to the downside. And it's actually one of my favorite trades because they tend to be fast. Right.

We'll see that we've ran all the way up, that it ran all the way up. And this move from 466 to 565 has taken essentially until the 16th of July. And then from the 16th of July, we've gone from 565 down to 532. So still not necessarily in a correction, but kind of on the precipice. But what I'm highlighting is this is like a bigger percentage move in a shorter time frame than relative on this side. So for me, if I'm looking to trade things to the downside, there's a couple immediate triggers that I would look for. And this is a big one actually in terms of, you know, again, depending on what specifically you're trying to build because even being short the market here writ large, to me, there's a bunch of really, really simple positions that can be built that would run into the downside. But I actually have a different approach. And when I'm looking for weakness, I want to find things that are really, really displaying weakness. So let's look for that.

So let's look for that. What I'm going to do is pull up a scan. And I'm going to grab a query that is going to look for a few things. This first one is going to look for general negative momentum. Ruta Vegas says put seem to always be more expensive than calls. That's very astute observation. Do you guys know what that's called? That is a very specific phenomenon that's well documented. We know it's there. But good eye. I'm glad that you saw that. That's completely correct. Put skew. That's exactly correct. That is called put skew. Now there are different kinds of skew in the market. But Oxchot calls it Valskew. I wouldn't call it that personally because Valskew can be skewed not necessarily just to the put side. So I think if you want to call it like put Valskew or something, I'm okay with that. But I think you'd have to be just a little more specific. Now even something like put skew can be context dependent because if we take a look at something like spy and we look at these 49 day options and we look at the puts. Same Delta puts. Let's find these 30s. 30 Delta put is 814 to 830. 30 Delta call is 632, 649. Sorry. 595, 609",

    "text": "be context dependent because if we take a look at something like spy and we look at these 49 day options and we look at the puts. Same Delta puts. Let's find these 30s. 30 Delta put is 814 to 830. 30 Delta call is 632, 649. Sorry. 595, 609 for the 30 Delta call. So like literally a two point difference. Big, big difference. Now that's put skew. And there's a very specific reason why put skew exists. Can you guys answer that for me in the chat? And while you're answering that, I will go through and show you another kind of put skew, which is again, it's all contextual. But I can take a look at the open interest or the volume transacted in a day. And the volume that transacted today also had put skew, just from a volume perspective where we have 5.7 million puts trade against 4 million calls. More puts traded. That's also put skew from a volume perspective. You can look at it. Oh, not from a Delta. You could look at it from a Delta perspective, but not what I'm talking about. From an OI perspective, right? So right now there's massive put skew in terms of OI. Elon Song says, hedging by institutional traders, that's a good guess. Tommy says market willing to pay higher premium to protect the downside. That's the correct answer. So Elon songs, you're not far off. I wouldn't restrict it to be that specific though,",

That's the correct answer. So Elon songs, you're not far off. I wouldn't restrict it to be that specific though, because it's not necessarily just hedging by institutional traders that leads to put skew. But it is the general willingness for people to overpay to protect the downside. And there's a reason why that has to happen. Because if you're on the other side of that trade and you're selling those puts, you know that you are stepping in front of a train track. And sooner or later, it will show up. So in order for this to make sense for a put seller in the aggregate, they're going to demand a premium. So even though technically, these are overpriced on a relative basis, they essentially have to be. Otherwise, nobody would transact with them because it doesn't make sense to. I would much rather have a position. If these were priced fairly, I would much rather have the downside position. Why wouldn't I? But the reason why I don't trade long puts just for general hedging is because they are so expensive on a relative basis. So good observation, specifically by who was that? Rudebega. Yeah, you'll typically find that. Now, it's not always the case, but generally, you will find that as the case. Great eyeball. Back to",

So if we're trying to trade stuff to the downside, there's a couple primary profit mechanisms that I lean on. So for here, you can see that you guys already gave me the purpose. The purpose here is we want something to be able to make money to the downside. Then my job as the trader is to figure out what profit mechanism is going to make the most sense for this kind of thesis. And there's two of them really. There's great volatility trading opportunities that will exist right now. Harder to get short deltas on them, which we'll talk about. Beta weighted deltas to the SP 500. By the way, that's what I'm referring to there. The easier profit mechanism for downside plays in my opinion is to trade directionally. Now, if we want to trade directionally via breakouts, break downs, momentum drift, we have to look a little bit for that, which is the game plan right now. So what I need to do first is actually limit this. So we'll look at like 50 names. The reason why I have to limit this is because a lot of",

So now what I'm doing is I'm looking at the sector performance for the last 35 and one day. And I'm looking for what's been hanging out at the bottom most frequently. And guess what it is. Any guesses you guys? You probably know. If you don't know, you do know. Tech Tommy is wrong. It is not tech. Captain Chris says how we doing. Thank you for the live stream. Absolutely. Happy to do it. Uh, Well, Tommy already bit the bullet for you guys. There's kind of two things that showed up. There you go. We long songs. That's what I'm talking about consumer discretionary. Literally, it's that's what's been shown up at the bottom. This is very common. Again, like the way that I scan the markets is not by happenstance. I generally know what I'm going to see after I see these things. Right. So if I find products that have been showing weakness and I'm seeing centralization of weakness across an individual sector when I'm trying to find stuff that's near lows, that's not a mistake.

So if I find products that have been showing weakness and I'm seeing centralization of weakness across an individual sector when I'm trying to find stuff that's near lows, that's not a mistake. So 30 days consumer discretionary was second from the bottom. Five days, it was second from the bottom. One day, it's at the bottom. Now to Tommy's point, tech started slowing down. Tech was at the bottom. 30 days. Then five days, it was third from the bottom. And then one day, tech is like fifth from the bottom. So tech is also completely viable here for a downside play. But again, I'm going to particularly look for weakness. Now, I also have to be honest. In general, I don't love fading tech. And it's just because it can be a bit of a bumpy road. It doesn't mean that I won't, but it's not my general preference. So now what I would do is go into something like market watch. I would pop up in the SP 500 and I'll take a look and consumer discretionary. Let's just see what's in here. Amazon's getting killed, which is kind of tech. Tesla's getting killed, which is kind of tech. So we can see those are not doing well. We can see booking holdings is doing terribly Airbnb is not doing well. So we can see Carmax is also not doing well. So",

Now there's an important diversion that happens. I don't necessarily want to pick the stuff that's at the bottom. The reason being is because sometimes things that are at price extremes, the same reason why I would trade any other price extreme is that the propensity for some sort of reversion is actually kind of high. So I don't want to trade the rubber bands that are expanded all of the way. So that gives me some general ideas to start with. Now what I'll do is come back into the scan and adjust these parameters. And I want to find stuff that's down a little bit more, not just negative, but I want to find stuff that's down at least 5 on the year. So this should clean up some of those results. So we just dropped a little bit more, which is good. Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to find stuff that over kind of the past six months is negative. And I want to find stuff over the past six months that's negative that's also negative on the past one month. So something like",

Something like T-Doc is also going down very clearly. S-Y-M is getting beat to the downside. So all of these start to become viable for perspective downside place. Now today something like S-Y-M, I noticed that as it came down, you can see that this was a doji. I don't care so much about the doji. I care about the expansion of buy volume. So this shows me that there are buyers that are starting to step in. So it makes me slightly less interested in this to the downside, although it doesn't mean it's not viable still is. S-P-C-E looks like a great downside play. V is something like short calls. So I don't necessarily see this accelerating massively to the downside. And also, do you guys happen to notice what you see here? These are two alerts. And it's because I was trading volatility risk premium in this. So I had a position on literally that I took off today.

But that's the way that I would want to trade this one specifically. Now it has earnings. So at this point, I would either trade it for an earnings player wait until post earnings or trade it up until earnings. You got another five days. But that's the first access to good short deltas that I see. I would come in here and I would just sell calls. Now there's different ways to structure that kind of trade.

So T dock is another one that I like to the downside. This one would be set something like here with a stop at like 827 or above, really above. 827 is where I'd want to be getting out.

But you'll probably see it on the call side as well here. And or we could take a look at structuring some sort of diagonal. Now it has a lot of calls, which is slightly bullish in tenor. But let's take a look at what these puts look like. I don't love them. I don't love the liquidity here. But you notice how these at the money calls, they're at a 23 delta. So the market is really pricing in the downside. The market is heavily, heavily expecting this not to break up towards ten, but definitely even down towards five. It kind of likes it. I don't want to say it likes it more, but it likes it enough that that's an interesting move, right? So what I'm looking at here, these two columns, this is probability of in the money, probability of a touch, the probability of touching ten in this product right now is 33 against a 44 probability of hitting five. So this looks absolutely right to the downside. Now again, to trade it via short calls, this",

So this looks absolutely right to the downside. Now again, to trade it via short calls, this would be fine. Something that's like right at the money. You'd have to put on a million of them because it's only ten bucks and you're going to get like 23, 24 dollars, but you could put on a bunch of them or you could find some puts to get into, but these aren't liquid enough. So this is just an example on why I would probably also sell calls on this for the downside place. So let's two downside trades that we found in just a matter of minutes, really. And depending on how many we would want for the portfolio, this is exactly how the process would go, but I'm going to take a break and take a look at what you guys are seeing. Anthony says consumer discretionary is middle class consumer spending, higher percent of income and rental insurance, less discretionary funds to do things outside the essential. Yeah, I completely agree with that. And I think that in the kind of market that we have now, it doesn't surprise me literally whatsoever to see discretionary struggling here, like literally at all, I think it completely checks out.

ActShot says 5 is applicable to ETS because 5 drops in stock is common. It's not necessary. I'm not necessarily trying to bifurcate it like that when I was searching for 5 downside in that context is because I specifically was just looking for things that have clearly shown downside weakness on the year. So I wanted stuff that wasn't just negative over the last 252 trading days, but I wanted stuff that was posting negative returns because there's a propensity for momentum even to the downside. And again, that's why I don't want to look for things that are at extremes because a reversal is very likely. I want to find stuff that's just slowly grinding lower. That becomes a really attractive trade for me. So that's the idea. We have mango orange in the house. I like the mango orange lot. It's probably my favorite spin drift. Ryan says, do you have any vid? I got a ton of vids. Let me be honest with you. Do you have any vids going over how you use unusual whale specifically for options? Not yet.

But I don't have anything yet. Ryan says like when you see bid and mids or structured plays, it can be hard to see they give real definitions, but it's hard to read the possible play. Yeah. So a couple of things when you're using options in general like that is regardless if it's unusual whales or just TNS time and sales. The first thing is if you have stuff that's at the midpoint, you can make a guess. So for example, this 110 call 17 Jan got filled at 89 cents. The market was 83 by 90. So do I think that this was likely bought or sold? I would lean towards it being bought because it's one penny off the offer and it's several pennies off six of them from the bid. So I would just innately assume that this was more likely bought than sold. Now another really important thing for everybody to understand is that none of this is concrete. Literally none of this. So when the market shows this green for buying and this red for selling, they're still guessing. It's not certain. It's very close to certain, but it's not certain. And I think it's important to understand that. So when this is showing the market at a penny",

There's not like a print that tells us that's what happened. We're making assumption based on where the market is and where the trade was. I just think it's really important for people to understand that even when you see the coloring here, that the platforms are still making an assumption. So that's that part. Now the other component that I think for Ryan, it's important to understand is at least for me, I don't care about spreads. So you'll notice that I essentially get rid of spreads almost always. They don't mean enough to me in this context. Now you can lose some trades that would come through by spreads that could still be informative if they're large enough. But in general, I simplify it. I'm looking for things that are really displaying some specific strong conviction. So I much much much prefer single options for that use case.

Again, you can leave it on there if you want and kind of see where people are transacting around to have an idea. So like this mid, let's see, this came in at 90 cents. But see, like this is just another interesting example. This got flagged at the mid because there was multiple trades that came in with this. But it came in at an average of 90 cents. The market was 90 by 92. So even though this is flagging it as a mid because of the multiple transactions, you could still probably make a guess that these came in at the bid, meaning that they were sales. But again, we don't know for certain. And it's always important to remind yourself of that in the beginning because we don't know yet. So yeah, I'm trying to see other interesting examples. This one's super weird up here. Where was it? The wait, worth, no, nevermind. So this one, right? So this is like dead set mid. You have no idea and you can't know.

And it's just not even worth your time trying to guess unless there's other, unless this was like a massive trade up, this was like a 2 million trade, which it wouldn't come in at the mid. That's kind of the cool point. The cool part, that was a mix of point and part. The cool part is that larger trades, they don't come in at the mid. They're too big. They push the market. So you can still, if it's a big enough trade, it's naturally going to trend towards one direction or the other. So it kind of makes it a little simpler actually to find. So this one's 475. And again, this one's dead set mid, nothing to derive from that. So yeah, typically you can just kill the mids off. Because the other thing to keep in mind is from a psychological perspective, if I'm trying to transact at the mid, I'm not in any sort of big rush to put the trade on. It means I'm trying to get a good fill. I'm trying to play the field a little bit. Whereas if you have people that are coming in at the bid",

So you can, again, come up with some reasonable estimations, but reiterate, we don't know for certain. It's an estimation. So hopefully that answers your question. Ruta Begas says, I read something about selling poor man covered calls. If you can't afford that many shares, seem too good to be true. But what do I know? I don't know. I would need more context. Happy to take a look at it and explore that with you. But and I assume when you say selling poor man covered calls, you mean buying the options and then selling calls against it. That's essentially the, what I do, which is called a ratio diagonal. I don't like the colloquial names for things. I really prefer the technical terms. It's just I guess me being annoying. But that sounds like you're looking at ratio diagonals. So let me throw a link to that for you. There. But yeah, the ratio diagonals are a good strategy.

There's a series of drawbacks when you're trading something like a ratio diagonal. So especially the way that I trade them. Again, when I'm saying ratio, the diagonal, that's the same as what they're referring to, which is the poor man's covered call. Now, the cool part about a ratio called the agnol, I can put it on the call or the put side. The poor man's covered call typically applies to the call side. But long call diagonal debit spread. Yeah, exactly. Yep. I'm following you. So yeah, the strategy itself is pretty good. I mean, when you say seem too good to be true, what element of it seemed too good to be true to you. And then the mean time gravitaris is when you say sell calls, would those be covered calls? Not necessarily no. So in the context like here, like we're looking at fading, what was it? T-dock.

The reason why I mentioned that it's the pass through account is because it has no money in it. But two, because it's regulation T margin, whereas my typical trading account is portfolio margin. I think this is more applicable to people. So the margin to put on these short calls is 123.50. And then if it's starts going against us, it expands to like 350. Tree Fitty, like that lockness monster. So it's a really good return. So in this case, what I would be doing is literally just selling the calls. Zach says so is this buying a call on the same stock? Never understood what Porman cover call ratio diagonal is. Check out that video up above. The video up above will get you schooled up super fast on what the diagonals are. But it's typically same side. So a Cliff Notes version, which is actually what I'm running right now on CrowdStrike. And I closed it out today. But what I do is I like to go further out in time, typically greater than 60 days. And then if I want to trade it to the downside, I'll look at the puts, I'll find puts that are reasonably bit asked spread. So like these 77s, look at me 4810 by 4935. So about 1.2",

That's okay. So I would come in here, look at snag in some of these. So let's say we start with buying five of those. And then you can sell puts against it. So then I would go further out of the money, maybe something like these two hundies analyze this, maybe sell like two of those to really favor the downside. And that is a ratio put diagonal. I have long, I have long puts, short puts more long puts than short puts, hence the ratio. And the idea here is to try and capitalize on the downside move while still collecting some premium from these short calls against the long options that were purchased. So that's that. All right, let's pivot back over now quickly. Actually, this is perfect. This is talking about structuring trades. So what I would love now is if you guys have trades that you're looking at anything that you have on that you want to have on or just stuff you're interested in, we can take a look at some names and just come up with an analysis.

We can or go the portfolio fit component. And then we can just talk about structuring trades. Spicy avocado says wouldn't it be better just to pick one and go with it? Not necessarily. No. Now it depends again on what we're looking at, which is if it's something that you really want to trade to the downside, you absolutely can just sell puts. But there's a few things that come into play. It's that like if we know where something is going to go, then there's a easy equation. But I don't know where shit's going to go. I'm actually wrong all the day I'm time on where I think things may or may not go. So the idea is to scrub off some directional risk. It's some delta hedging. But more importantly, it's to help the position because here's the downside to using options. If I take a look at this 18 oct trade and I go here, I'm losing eight dollars a day from theta decay, even though that these are far out in time and pretty far in the money, they still suffer from theta decay. So by selling options against it, I'm also offsetting some of the Greeks impact. And in this case, theta is a big",

So in the trade that I put on, which was what short the 200s, I'm essentially collecting 300 per contract. So if we take a look at this, these are giving me 24 cents of theta each day. So even though I have five long options that are losing eight dollars a day, I now have two options that are gaining 24 a day each. So I'm able to offset my theta decay for the long options. So it's just another way to look at it. But to your point, there's absolutely nothing wrong at all with just using one. Like if I have a really strong directional conviction, either I'll sell it at a very light ratio or I just won't sell it at all. Another thing I like to do is leg into them. So I'll put on the base position first. That's exactly what I did in CrowdStrike is I put the base position on as we broke out here. And then I chose to sell puts when it started slowing down.

There's a reason, there's a very specific reason why I like the ratio diagonal much more than a standard diagonal. So let's take a look at a standard diagonal, which is typically buying the at the money. Let's turn these off. And then selling something that's further out of the money. Now we can modify it a little bit too. We can slide that option a little bit further in the money. Let me take this a little further in. Oh, I did the same expiration. Some an idiot. My bad.

All right, what do we think? On a six month basis still trending up. One month basis still trending up pretty strong. Three month basis trending up but flattening down. One month basis. And we are negative. We are downward sloping standard deviation channels are going down. So when I look at this, this literally right here is actually kind of the initial eyeball spot I see. And the way I look at it is I want to see what it does in that level. If it starts breaking up above this, I'm still not necessarily massively bullish until it starts breaking above these here. And then eventually this here. So if I wanted to trade it to the upside if I had a long thesis, I would probably trade via short puts, something I can manage or something I can kind of be slightly wrong and still make money. And then if it breaks down below this, again, I personally wouldn't want a short Nvidia. But if I did, you can either run short calls or like a ratio",

And then if it breaks down below this, again, I personally wouldn't want a short Nvidia. But if I did, you can either run short calls or like a ratio put diagonal, both of those are viable. And then the near term profit target for something like that or near term price target would be something around like 91.5 down towards this point of control. Something like this. That is generally what I see. Now from an options perspective, I still see bullish drift priced in. So 14.9 million calls against 14.3 million puts. So definitely more calls wanting to be traded here. And if I take a look at the implied vol for the out of the monies. And then let's clear off those and take a look at these. So it's all downside risk. Really, that's being priced in not much upside. So yeah, I mean, that's the cliff notes version. I essentially want to see how this works. All right.

So if you want to trade this to the downside and you can't literally just go in there by that and then buy a really far out of the money wing by like a 20 delta wing. So you're not going to chew up a bunch of the credit that you're going to receive. And you essentially still get the same exposure, which is looking at a short call vertical. So yeah, that's we all start with smaller accounts and you have to be thrifty and you know, essentially structure stuff a little bit differently, but this is a completely viable way to do it. The downside here is the margin requirement is much greater because it's now just calculating based on the width of the wings.

Typically, they would be closer in explorations as well, but that's okay. And then the 220 here. So it's more of a calendar spread. But this is like a very, I think that's more what we were kind of talking about, not necessarily the standard diagonal. The reason why is just because it's the same strike, by the way. So like if I do the instead of buying the 220s, and instead I sell like the 215s and grab the 220s, that's a diagonal. And notice how it has upside risk. So the reason why this has upside risk is because what ends up happening is as the underlying moves, the short deltas move fast enough to overwhelm the long deltas.

Ukraine says, is it better to buy options to close to them? Oh, that fucked me up. That's funny. I was reading as buy to close. So Ukraine says, is it better to buy options close to the money or out of the money? It's a great question. And I've actually made a video recently with GameStop, as I think that somebody's chagrin. I don't know if I'm allowed to say that because I think somebody said they don't want to hear it, but you know, too fucking bad. But I have a video. This will be for you, Ukraine, which is about buying call options smarter. Like I said, I use GameStop as the context for the video because I know a lot of people that trade GameStop are buying options. And the goal of that video is to try to help them out a little bit instead of just lighting their money on fire perpetually. But the video applies to anything. And the answer to that really, it depends on what you're trying to accomplish with the position. So there's different ways you can structure it. So that video will literally walk you through it in depth. It goes through how to pick expiration cycle, how to pick Delta, all those kinds of things. So should be, should",

If you model, if you let me know the exact trade that you want me to look at, we can look at it together. But a lot of that PL behavior is going to depend heavily on what you pick. So if you outline the trade that you want me to look at, we can take a look at it together. And then in the meantime, we still have a few minutes left.

There's a big reason for those that don't know. I've always referred to us as the outlier community, even when like the branding overall was ES invests, which ES is just my initials. It the way that this whole platform YouTube channel that stuff started was just like I was sharing information with my friends that were in the military during COVID. Long story short, the community grew, which is awesome, but I've always referred to this as the outlier community because that's what I pursue as an individual's outlier performance. Okay, so that ties to this because this is a great example of normal people performance. This is a great example of how normal people look at markets and realistically, how you probably should not look at markets.

And I mean, it just dropped right through it. And now it looks like it's entering another volume node. The next volume node is literally right here. You can see it right there.

So for me, this would be nothing yet. I would want to see at least another day or two to see how it performs. The thing that you'll notice about my approach to trading is very rarely am I trying to top tick or bottom tick things. I don't care to catch things at like the perfect time. I want to put on stuff that generally shows strength so that there's a higher probability of it doing what I want it to do. That's the idea. So in this kind of scenario, like I just had a big down move. I would favor it to the downside. I wouldn't be opposed to trading something like short puts because I know Voles can be really high. If it starts to base and show strength, like this kind of scenario is great for selling short puts, right? So you could see drop down drifted south. Ever so slightly started to look okay.

That's generally going to run unsuccessful in my opinion. Oh, Cliffs says what platform broker. This is think or swim, which is through Schwab. Ram Alama says, could you elaborate a little more on the wide wings for selling calls, synthetic short strangle by doing an odd core? Yeah, what about it? When you say Mr. Lama, let me know what you want to talk about specifically there. And I'm happy to. But yeah, that's that's like a really common approach for smaller accounts is to just add the longer wings. The other thing sometimes is I'll do it literally just for risk control.

Ramas says, it seems like the golden egg being able to manage an execute naked call put selling. Yeah. Okay. So you're asking more for the trade off. And the trade off is very clear. Vertical spreads typically are negatively expectant by their structure. I'll literally grab my calculator and I'll show you. Let's take a look at a vertical spread in here. Let's do like 49 days.

That's that's kind of the nature of options. So the other problem with it is you give up a lot of your potential profit. Again, there's a positive, right? You're capturing and you're managing your risk, which that's the thing about trading is that it's a series of trade-offs so that you can structure things exactly how you want it.

Okay, so Oxshot says broken wing butterfly. All right, let's take a look. But let me know if that answers some of your question Lama on like why like the trade-off because that's all it is. That's not to say that verticals are terrible. I don't like them in general because I just think it's better to move past them as fast as you can. But like they're not going to break anything. That's kind of the cool part about verticals is that they move slow. So you're not necessarily going to break any records to the upside. And it's not going to be terrible to the downside.

What kind of milk do you guys like? I am a whole milk kind of guy. I feel like that's less common now though. I feel like people are like really, really. Well, that's cool. They have like a strapped family cream ain't never heard of that. Let's grab that. Whole milk spicy avocado. I respect your game. I feel like that's the right. I feel like that's the right go. Keto-minded. I see. I like it. Ox shot is going for the balance 2. That's good. I think that's fair to want to balance it out a little bit. I feel like I'm just a little bit more reckless than that. And I don't actually care. All right. So I got what I need. Let me get this milk order off. Yo, this fucking the Strauss family creamery organic whole milk. It's half a gallon for 7. They are not playing no games. All right. That's that was a must. Thanks for hanging in there because milk is like my lifeblood. So if I was going to have Mexican food without milk, I don't know what I was going to do. It was going to be a big problem. Big, big problem. All right. So back up to this butterfly.

Because you have to remember the probability that you set is at the time of entry. And the probability that's realized is going to change based on how the underlying moves. So it's kind of a really really important differentiation to make right because if you use probability of being in the money that will be whatever number it is at the beginning of the trade. But then as the trade starts to move that's going to change in the probability of touch in my opinion is a much more conservative metric. Rory Tittie says what's probability of a touch great question that simply means what is the probability of price getting to that level before expiration. So probability of in the money is the probability of an option expiring in the money at the time of entry, you know, using current vol. Then the probability of touch is what is the probability that the price of the underlying touches a point gets to a certain point. That's probability of a touch, which is a really important metric, especially if you're doing anything that includes managing a trade. To another giant mistake people make.

I think to 27. So what's the probability of touching 27 over the next expiration cycle, which is 27? The probability of touching 27 is like 54. It's a really good probability. And that would be a really, really massive loss on a relative basis. So I actually wouldn't love this trade personally. It's not collecting enough because you're collecting 106 for that probability of getting up to 27, which would lose you 550. Right. So you're making one risking five and a half. Not a fam that in it. That's not what I would do. So in this kind of case, if I wanted to trade vol, I probably would have to trade it via a strangle and go both sides so that you can get the puts queue. Because these are going to be way more right like on a 29 delta, you're getting a dollar 30 something compared to a dollar eight for the same 30 delta on the call side. So that will kind of even it out a little bit. It'll help you. Right. So now if you get up to that 27, handle, you're losing 400 bucks, but you're collecting 243.

If it hangs out here now, obviously you added risk to the other side now, but I would be less concerned with the downside risk because it's, I mean, it's already only at 17 bucks. So even if it goes down to seven, this lose 563 bucks, but what's the probability of it touching down to seven in this time frame, which is 27 probability of us getting to seven for a touch is 4.8. So you see how I kind of think about how I want to build the trade based on probabilities so that I'm not just, I now this looks like a good trade before it looked like a problem. But by collecting that puts skew side of things, again, you do open up downside risk. So if you have a really strong directional disposition, then there's nothing wrong with just trading the short calls and accept the risk.

But I mean, essentially anything I first saw when I was breaking above here is one of my first alert went off. And I absolutely think TLT will continue to rally. My guess is that it'll start getting gummed up in like the hundreds. And so it's getting really close. I think the overall profit potential on this will be fairly limited because even if it gets above this 100 handle and it starts rallying into the one with like, that's the thing, right? Like we're now talking about two point moves. It's just not that exciting for me. So when I first traded TLT, it was really trading like this move from the high 80s into the mid 90s. That's what I cared about. That was a much better move. And now even though it looks like it's going off into the moon on a relative basis, it's just not moving a ton. It's moving to be clear.
