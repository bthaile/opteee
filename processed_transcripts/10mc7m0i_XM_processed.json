    "text": "There is no magic indicator as a trader. Indicators are simply used to help us contextualize and measure things. You're way better off starting your upstair trading career by focusing on what I've referred to as profit mechanisms. These are market effects that actually lead to making money. So for example, SPX, this has gone up over the last few weeks. That's a profit mechanism. The price direction of this thing going up. Same thing when price direction goes down. Same thing when you're trading variance risk premiums where implied volatility trends over realized volatility. All of these things are profit mechanisms. If you spend more time researching the profit mechanism, that will lead you to natural assumptions and a better starting point on how to capture the profit mechanism and make money trading versus spending too much time worrying about what MACD indicators setting to use or any of these other signals and indicators. It can be useful, but it all comes back to the basics of what is the actual thing you're trying to make money off of being all aware of. See you later.",
