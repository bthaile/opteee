And then for those that are interested later today at 5 p.m. Pacific time, we have our options trading for beginners live stream. So today's kind of an open ended day will cover whatever topics you all want to spend a little time diving deeper into. But these recessions built around and for beginners. So this is where you can come ask all of those beginner questions that you might not feel comfortable sharing them somewhere else or you're just struggling to pick up. That's what it's for. So let's get right in today. I actually did not love the price action in game stop. And the reason why I didn't love the price action is because game stop was kind of a little bit down today. If I zoom this in a little bit, you can see that we opened at 2225 and then we closed at 2221. So essentially a flat day, but I don't like that it's slightly negative. There's a few reasons for this primarily because the larger burden of where we think interest rates are going and what small caps are doing was actually slightly lifted today. And this is what I'm referring to right here. I WM had a pretty big day today. It was over 3. And",

And this comes back from Big Daddy J pal hanging out with the boys at Jackson Hole and they're just out there talking their shit. Obviously I'm joking, but they're talking about inflation and they're starting to signal that they think it's about time. And the reason why I don't appreciate the way GME behaves today from a price perspective. I was hoping for more of a pop is what I'm getting at is we can take a look at this. This is the number of companies in the New York stock stock exchange. So a lot of smaller made cap stocks that have made highs today. So when I look at this yesterday net highs lows was 136 companies today. It was 287 a massive change. Now the other thing is gross highs lows, meaning just a raw number, not net yesterday. Gross highs was 153 in today. It's 293 almost double. So a lot of small cap stocks saw a breath of fresh air today. And you can see that bit across this whole thing.

Which to some degree, that's not bad because it means that we don't necessarily have an additional headwind. But I really, really was hopeful that we might see a little bit of life come in today. And we just didn't really see this pop through. So volume today again for kind of two days running was overwhelming sale volume and very light four million shares traded with. I mean, we're below the 20 day average. We're slightly above the five day average, which is nice just to see a little bit of volume picking up on a relative basis, but it's still pretty contracted unfortunately. So again, it goes back to this thing until we start to see volume picking up to some degree. This is more or less what I expect to see is kind of this sideways trending action. And my expectation would be as soon as we start seeing some volume flow into this, we'll start to see some price movement. Now the other positive I do want to highlight here, although I don't love that we're starting to rotate over ever so slightly is that we have been range bound. Essentially from the ninth, we've",

Now the other positive I do want to highlight here, although I don't love that we're starting to rotate over ever so slightly is that we have been range bound. Essentially from the ninth, we've been trading almost straight sideways. So one of the benefits to that looking on the bright side of things again is that even though there's decent sale volume, it's not strong enough to really start pushing price down, which is also awesome to see. So a bit of a mixed bag, I suppose. I just really wanted to see with the broader market lifting today, some of that flow over into this, but I mean, that's just how it goes sometimes. So let's take a look at the option stream. And today we had a decent amount of a wide bleed off. So there's 574,000 calls. And after today, 100,000 of those are gone. So we are again, in this quieter period with respect to just where we're seeing options activity. You're always keeping an eye on it as I said I would, but there's just not a whole lot to keep an eye on it. It's relatively slow and steady in here.

I took my volatility trade down today because I started thinking I got the move I was going to get and sure enough, vol dropped from over 80 for this expiration cycle down to 72. So there's a little bit of a move there, but I took it down before this move because otherwise, I mean, I would just start losing money on this trade at this point, the, the vol trade. I still expect that 72 to go up for sure, but it's just taken its sweet time. Now the other thing I did want to see is based on the volume today, very light. And it looks like most of it is moving out into the next expiration cycle. So kind of standard general behavior here for a game stop playing mostly on the front, the front options. And again, reminder, we have earnings coming up on the fourth schedule right now for before the open. The other thing I did was take a look for the whole week. And I wanted to see in game stop first.

So just again, another example of a pretty quiet week with respect to the options chain. All right. Quick peek at Chewie because the interesting thing in here is that we've started running sideways here as well. So back from a quick break grab of drink of water. Actually, it's a little bit of a pedea light getting a hydration on. So in Chewie, they've also been really trending sideways. I think I already told you guys I had some long calls that I exited out here. And it's just because it just wasn't moving, right? So in here, it was rallying pretty hard. And then my guess is that it's quite likely to consolidate into earnings, which it has on the 28th.

Whereas when we typically look at GameStop, it's very siloed to front exploration, second exploration as the front exploration is expiring. And you know, that whole bit here, it continues to be all over the place. But there's definitely a position in going on for earnings, which again, is on the 28th, which will be captured here. And you can see that there's double calls to puts. So still relatively small, 32k to 15k, but nonetheless bullish positioning as far as I can see, or earnings coming up. And we can see earnings, all nice and high as per usual. So 128 vol, which promptly drops down to 96, which again, is what I expect to see for earnings, unlike what we're seeing in GameStop. Now, obviously, before we get too far, we actually, if you go back to GameStop, because you all know it needs to happen, we got a poor one out for the homies because there is just a bunch of people, again, that have options that just expired completely worthless.

    "text": "because you all know it needs to happen, we got a poor one out for the homies because there is just a bunch of people, again, that have options that just expired completely worthless. We can see, for example, of this 11,000, there was 1700 added over yesterday in only 7600 traded today. So some, I'm guessing the majority of the 7600 would be people trying to grab whatever value they can, but that leads several thousand that just expired worthless. So shout out to the homies. That's how she goes sometimes. Now again, I continue to reiterate this point. If you buy calls or if you buy options, I have a video, I will link to it as I always do, on a way to do this a little bit better, a little smarter so that we're not just lighting money on fire on a weekly basis. It does not have to be like that. So I'll throw that in the notes below in case you want to check that out. And in case you just want to stay playing the fronts and seeing what happens, that's cool too, whatever floats your boat. Now the last thing I'll say about chewy is when I look at chewy options activity for this past week, I get a different view. And it's, I mean, take a look at this. This is for this entire week call side on the ask side. And this is literally all that populates, right? And we're",

This is for this entire week call side on the ask side. And this is literally all that populates, right? And we're already down here to 207. So much smaller aggregate size and total trading here. This chain in chewy is also relatively quiet at this time. So that is the expiration week for here again, coverage as promised, but not a whole lot to report at this time. Now tomorrow we have our game stop YouTube livestream at 5pm Pacific time. This will be another solo one. I'm chatting with Newton to see if we can find a time that fits with his schedule a little bit better in the coming weeks to get us back together for some of those kind of fun joint sessions. But really at this point, I'm still spending a lot of time digging into the background. So that's the goal for tomorrow. If there's anything you think I should take a look at, let me know. I would love to. Until next time, be an outlier. I'll see you guys later.",
