    "text": "tomorrow but this is essentially the latest documentation that's been added on the 14th of August so the whole thing is continuing to move along it looks like it started back on 23 a in 22 so yeah this is the the website the case you can look up to find it if you're so interested all right let's turn over to here take a look at GameStop what are we seeing here well we're seeing sideways and that's essentially the the long and short from at actual price perspective volume is still super super light volume today was 3.6 million against the 20-day average of 7.28 million we contracted volume over yesterday which is 5.3 today's 3.6 so volume is just super low here we're not seeing a lot of movement this kind of further bolsters this whole consolidation thesis now one thing that's worth pointing out that I think is favorable for GameStop is small caps is starting to grab a little bit of a leg here so that just adds a general wind at the back of small cap stocks when the broader index itself is progressing in a positive direction so that part is actually in my opinion pretty good to see so looking at GameStop options though specifically we had a t we had a ton expire today so if we take a look at the 16 Aug and we look at the out of the monies there is Music 346,000 look for on days",
