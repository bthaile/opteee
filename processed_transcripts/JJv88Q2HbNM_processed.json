    "text": "today we're going to talk about my absolute favorite bullish options trading strategy the ratio call diagonal I've talked about these before the goal of this video is to refresh what you've heard maybe integrate some new data points and then walk you through holistically how this strategy works so this is what we're going to cover what the profit mechanism is how I think about setting it up how I manage it and I'm going to give you an example of a recent trade using this exact strategy so what is a ratio called diagonal well first let's start with how it makes money which is just generally a directional strategy bullish and nature because we want things to go up in this case and it's really designed to be an equity replacement so rather than buying shares of a stock I would run this strategy for very similar thesis so I'm looking for things that are moving up so what is the structure for the strategy well it's these pieces here so I'm going to start with buying to open in the money calls that are typically greater than 60 DTE let's talk about this one first why in the money because it gives me better movement with the underlying which I'll explain what that means how far in the money for me typically at the very least 60 Delta for the long options if not further very often it will be 70 80 something like that so",
