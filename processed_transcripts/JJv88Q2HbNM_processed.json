    "text": "Today, we're going to talk about my absolute favorite bullish options trading strategy, the ratio call diagonal. I've talked about these before. The goal of this video is to refresh what you've heard, maybe integrate some new data points, and then walk you through holistically how the strategy works. So this is what we're going to cover. What the profit mechanism is, how I think about setting it up, how I manage it, and I'm going to give you an example of a recent trade using this exact strategy. So what is a ratio call diagonal? Well, first, let's start with how it makes money, which is just generally a directional strategy bullish in nature because we want things to go up in this case. And it's really designed to be an equity replacement. So rather than buying shares of a stock, I would run this strategy for very similar thesis. So I'm looking for things that are moving up. So what is the structure for the strategy? Well, it's these pieces here. So I'm going to start with buying to open in the money calls that are typically greater than 60 DTE. Let's talk about this one first. Buy in the money because it gives me better movement with the underlying, which I'll explain what that means. How far in the money for me, typically at the very least 60 delta for the long options, if not further very often, or be 70, 80, something like that. So this",

How far in the money for me, typically at the very least 60 delta for the long options, if not further very often, or be 70, 80, something like that. So this is the first leg. The second leg would be short out of the money calls that are generally less than 40 DTE. There's kind of very specific criteria that I use in terms of what delta slash what strike I choose, which we'll talk about. And then there's the optional kicker options that I add to the trade. So this is a way to make a little bit more money if the trade moves big in my favor. So the base for this trade is this right here. It is the long calls. The short calls are an ancillary slash enhancement to the trade. And then the kickers are kind of a tertiary add on. These don't always go on. Neither does the short calls right away. These are also typically phased in. I manage them slightly differently. So this is the entire structure. Now I want to walk through how I actually set this thing up so that you can visualize it with me. Let's hop over to the platform and let's start with the long leg, the long call. So typically I would conduct my standard analysis, whatever that looks like for you and what I'm looking for",

So typically I would conduct my standard analysis, whatever that looks like for you and what I'm looking for are things that are going up. So in this case, I look at Nvidia and let's say I have a bullish thesis on it. It looks like it's pulling back. Now to be clear, this actually isn't something I probably would trade with this just being honest, mostly because it looks like it's at a bit of a capitulation point. I would want to see it rallying a bit more and it has earnings coming up. But let's just use it as an example. So let's say that we have a bullish thesis in Nvidia. There's a couple of ways you can trade that. You can just buy stock. That's completely okay. You can use this kind of strategy alternatively. So let's take a look first at that initial leg, the long call. Now you'll notice all these different expiration cycles. And the very first thing as I mentioned is that I like it to be at least 60 DTE if not more. Why is it at least 60? It's very simple. It's because I want to decrease the amount of theta that's bleeding out of the options. And then I also want to give the trade more time to",

Now if you'll recall from some of my one-on-one videos, if you haven't checked out that playlist, you should. It was a YouTube live series that I did, option trading for beginners. And there's a couple of things that we know. The further you go out in time, the slower theta decays, although the more overall theta there is. So theta in this context is just time value. So when we go out 65 DTE, we are at the very beginning worth theta decays faster, really when it starts closing within 60 DTE. Now when I look at these kinds of positions, you can decrease your theta by going further out in time. The other component is the further in the money you go, the more money you pay, but again, the less theta there is, the less time value. There is in the option, why is that? Because the deeper in the money you go, the more intrinsic value it has, which is simply how far in the money it is, and the less extrinsic value it has.

And a quick back-of-the-navagan way of looking at this is, let's say for example, we look at these 50 delta calls, the 122s. This is all extrinsic value. These are completely out of the money. Now if we go to, say for example, these 70 delta calls, they're trading, let's just call it 18 for simplicity. Well, that's 18 total. Of that 18, you can see by looking across to the corresponding out of the money option in this case, the out of the money put. And you can see how much of that roughly is extrinsic value. In this case, that's about six bucks. You can also just do the math, so you can take whatever your strike price is, in this case, the 107, you can subtract your strike price from the current price, and that'll tell you how far in the money it is. So in this case, it's like 11 in the money give or take. So you take 11 out of this, that's your intrinsic value, and then the result is your extrinsic value. So in this case, it's pretty close to this. Just a couple of different ways to do that. So we're now decreasing our theta decay in two different",

Just a couple of different ways to do that. So we're now decreasing our theta decay in two different methods by going further out in time and further in the money. Now it's important to understand the drawbacks because this is more expensive. And if you get an unfavorable move against you, you have more potential loss than if you buy a cheaper option. So again, for example, if I buy this 50 delta call for 1,000, okay, that's my max risk, whatever I pay. In this case, if I buy the 70 delta call, I'm paying 18, my max risk is now 1,800. The reason why this doesn't bother me is because I'm going to manage the trade. So it's not going to come down to that. But you should know that that exists just so that you understand how the strategy works. So now let's figure out what the theta decay is. In this case, it's 0.9 per day or 9 out of this total value. And just for comparison sake, let's say instead of the 65, we go out to like 190 DTE. Let's look at the same 70 delta call. And you'll notice that the theta decay for these is 5 cents a day.

So this is why I like going at the very least 65 or 60 days out, 65 plus in this case, just because it's the next primary expiration. Now, a couple of the things with respect to expiration selection is I prefer primary expirations, meaning monthly. And it's because they tend to be more liquid. I have another video that talks about option liquidity inside and out and all the ins and outs of it. So you can check that out to understand more of the details there. But suffice it to say monthly expirations will have more liquidity. So that brings us into most of the details around the long option. But there's a couple more that we have to solve for. So let's say we don't want to go to 65 because we know that if we hold it for, you know, two weeks will be in the steeper component of theta decay. So if we're expecting to hold this trade for a month or two, maybe we go out here to the",

So if we're expecting to hold this trade for a month or two, maybe we go out here to the 15. No, notice how I'm integrating how long I think I'm going to hold the trade for. That's the nature of being an options trader. Our positions are time bound. So I'm going to estimate how long I think I'm holding this position for. So if we go this 93 DTE and then we go in to the 71 delta. Why the 71 delta? Well, if you take a look again, it's for liquidity. This is a slightly more liquid strike than the surrounding strikes. So also why this delta, why not these further out of the money delta is that are cheaper. Well, it's because these will move better dollar for dollar with the underlying. So the higher your delta, the more expensive your option is. But it also means you're going to see more of the move at a given point in time. So in this case, if Nvidia goes up a dollar, I'm going to see 71 of a move. So I don't see that full 1, 100 if you're using 100 lots. I don't see that full dollar. I see 71 cents, but I see the majority of it. Whereas if you go further out of",

I see 71 cents, but I see the majority of it. Whereas if you go further out of the money, if you grab one of these cheaper options, that's a 30 delta. Well, if Nvidia moves that dollar, you only see 30 cents. What's the benefit of these further out of the money options? Well, they typically have higher gamma. Now you'll notice that these options that are really far out in time all have really low gamma. Gamma is the rate of change of delta. This is how you see those options that compound thousands of percent because of gamma. So in this case, I wouldn't look to add those kicker options this far out in time. We'll talk about those in a little bit, but those kicker options are designed to expose us to gamma, that compounding effect. So let's recap this long option. Let's see what it looks like. If we buy 10 of those 15 no of 105 calls that we were looking at, and we look at this option, we'll see that it has defined risk to the downside, and you'll see that it has unlimited profit potential up until the right, generally positively sloping, just like long stock.

So this is the base of the position. Now let's compare that to something like buying a thousand shares of Nvidia. You'll notice that just long stock has unlimited downside potential, same upside potential give or take, but notice the difference that the positions cost in order to put on. If we buy a thousand shares of Nvidia at spot, which is 117.29, that means you're going to have to put up a hundred and 17 thousand dollars, two hundred and ninety bucks to put that trade on. If I want to gain access to similar exposure via the 10 105 calls, the amount that I'm putting up for that position is a fraction of that cost. So in this case, it would be 2140 times your 10 times 100, so it would be 21 thousand dollars. So it's much cheaper to put the position on with options. This is where the leverage comes from. I'm controlling essentially the same size position slightly less, and if you know why it's slightly less, throw it in the comments, and then I'll answer why it's slightly less. The reason why is because long stock is Delta 1, meaning this is going to act like 1,000 shares right out of the gate. This 10 lot at the",

The reason why is because long stock is Delta 1, meaning this is going to act like 1,000 shares right out of the gate. This 10 lot at the 105 is not actually Delta 1. So if we go to 15, no 93 days out, and if we go to these 105s, you'll notice something very different. These are a 71 Delta. So this means that your 1 lot gives you access up to 100 shares. That's if the Delta is a 1, that would be 100 shares. So in this case, your Delta is 71. So that means every 1 lot you have is actually behaving like 71 shares. So in this case, this would be more so like 710 shares of Nvidia versus the 1000. That's why those look slightly different when you compare the risk profiles on them. So small admin note doesn't make a huge difference, but you should know that your exposure whenever you put the trade on in the beginning is going to be relative to your Delta's, not what it can be up to, which is up to controlling 100 shares equivalent per 1 lot. So that's the long option. Now let's take a look at the kicker options. The kicker options get added when I have strong conviction in something's going to move. And the reason is what I talked to",

The kicker options get added when I have strong conviction in something's going to move. And the reason is what I talked to you about before because they have the ability to compound massively. So if we go to these closer to at the money options here and you'll see that if I look at like these 32 Delta options that are 27 days to expiration, the 132s here, they have a 2 Delta. So that means that as Nvidia moves in my favor 1, I'm going to see 32 cents of the move and my Delta's are going to grow by 2. So this will go from 32 to 34 and so on and so forth as they get more and more moves in my favor. So by adding the kicker option, it gives your trade a pretty significant compounding capability, but you're holding something that's decaying relatively quick. So for example, looking at these 132s again, if we take a look at the theta decay on those, it's 12 cents or 12. So you're going to lose 12 cents of your 4.35 every single day. And this is because they're still pretty far out in time. As this gets closer and closer to expiration, let's take a look at these nine DTEs, go to like a 30 Delta for an equivalent,",

So these options are like 2. It's like 10 that's decaying away. So you have to be really careful when you're adding kicker options or trading out of the money options like that, it's kind of like playing hot potato. You got to be really, really thoughtful about those positions because they're decaying in front of your hands very quickly. So that's the kicker options in a nutshell. If you really have strong conviction, if I do, I'll add them, but it's a really small part of the trade. It's much smaller allocation than the total trade gets. Then let's take a look at the short option. So if you go back here, you'll remember that we're looking at short out of the money calls. So when do those get added? Well, sometimes they get added at the onset of the trade. Sometimes they get layered on as the trade moves. The way I think about the short calls is that they're again secondary. It helps me offset the cost of theta. So if we take a look at this 20 September expiration cycle, and we go to",

So if we take a look at this 20 September expiration cycle, and we go to an option that's out of the money. So maybe like these 134s, I tend to pick something around a 30 delta, 20 to 30 delta, somewhere in there on the initial. And let's take a look at what these do for us. They bring in about 385. So if we think about what the theta decay is on our 15 no one oh fives, and this shows us our theta decay is 0.7 per day. So 7 per contract. We have 10 contracts. So we're losing 70 per day in theta. And if I take a look at these short calls, well, realistically right out of the gate, one of them, if I collect this 385, we'll cover the cost of my theta, at least for a little bit. Not entirely, right? It's just one day of theta that I'm calculating there. So but that's just for a one lot. So if we take a look at what this trade looks like, once we layer in some of these short calls, it kind of takes this kind of shape. So one thing you'll notice that's very different about the way that I trade and why they're called ratio, called diagonals,",

So one thing you'll notice that's very different about the way that I trade and why they're called ratio, called diagonals, is in this case, you'll notice that there are 10 of the long options, but only three of the short options. Why is that? Why would I do that? Well, it's because this short option component, it gives me some money upfront. It gives me a credit upfront. So in this case, I would get my 385 times three contracts. So it gives me some money upfront. But the downside is you'll notice that it adds this little kink to my return profile. And you notice that that's right about where that short strike is. So when I'm collecting this credit upfront, it's at the expense of profitability. So let's use this 140 handle for an example. With these three short options against the position, this trade would make 14,894. If I get rid of that option and I go back to these 140s, the trade makes 17,924. So you notice that these slow things down a bit. Now they help me if there's not as big of a move. So for example, let's take a look at this 120 area ish. The 120s, I would make about 1550 with the short option. If I get rid of it and",

The 120s, I would make about 1550 with the short option. If I get rid of it and I go to the 120, I make 16.35 if it goes there tomorrow. If it doesn't, notice how this purple line which represents today and this blue line represents that expiration. Notice the difference here. Each day this purple line is going to move towards the blue line. So if that move doesn't happen quick enough, I actually would start to slowly lose money. Notice the difference when I add that short option. It actually helps me. My break even is improved pretty significantly because of the money this brings in. So how do I think about the short option? It's very simple. The trade off is do I want to collect more money upfront or do I want to prioritize capital growth? Those are the two choices. If I want to collect more money upfront, I will sell more of these and I can collect more money upfront. Notice though how I have to be careful how many I sell. So if you sell too many, you can actually be too right and lose money. This is what a more standard diagonal PL graph will look like. Where if it goes too far in your favor, you actually can",

And that's part of the reason why you'll see me use these ratios and some of the things I'll show you in a little bit. Make sure that I have no upside risk in the trade. I do not want to lose money if I'm too right. Super, super annoying. The way I think about it is in general, if I'm putting on the trade for a long thesis, I want to give the long options the best chance for success. So that means I'm typically going to air on the lighter side of shorts against the longs. Now something I'll do with the shorts is roll them out and up for a credit if possible if they fall in the money. If things move too fast, you can't always do that. So it's important to think about that ahead of time. So those are the legs, essentially, that I look at. So now let's talk about the products. What kind of products do I trade?

Realistically, it's going to require really liquid underlines because one of the things with liquidity is the further out in time you go, the less liquid the options get. You'll notice that the bid-ask spreads get wider and wider the further out in time you go. So I have to trade things that are liquid. In general for me, that's going to be SP 500 stocks. It's going to be ETFs. It's going to be sector ETFs. Things that have really, really strong underlying and then also option liquidity. And again, you can reference that video I mentioned earlier if you have questions on what's liquid or how to find something that's liquid. So that's the first thing. The other thing I'm going to look for are things that are generally moving up, things that are showing strength and moving in the direction that I want. What I don't want to do with this strategy is to try to bottom dip too much because it's really, really difficult to manage that because you have to have really effective capital management. Because again, remember, when I'm going further out in time and I'm spending more money on the option so that I can get a better delta, I don't want to actually risk all of that. I'm going to try to manage it. So that's why it's so",

So the products really simple, typically SP 500 stocks, things that have liquid options chains, ETFs. It's not limited to that. I absolutely will trade things that don't necessarily have like weekly option expirations for example, but in general, that's what I'm going to do. Now let's talk about the management. In the overall goal of the strategy, it's to trend follow. It's to follow something that's moving up. Now you'll notice that there's a portion where we can have these out of the money calls that then fall in the money if it goes in our favor. So for example, going back to this, we have short calls at 134. So if we get to a point where those short calls are in the money, we now have something that we at least have to deal with in some capacity. So there's different ways you can manage those short calls. You can close them down for a loss. I do that sometimes if it's a very small loss, not very frequently.

I do that sometimes if it's a very small loss, not very frequently. The other choice is to roll them out and up to increase your basis if possible. I do that pretty regularly. If you're using the short calls as a way to slowly unwind your trade, what I prefer to do is as I close the short calls, I will sell long calls to cover the cost of the short calls. So what would that look like? Let's say that I sold these calls for 3.80 and let's say when the underlying is trading at 140, let's just say that these are now trading at 5. So I'm losing 1.20. Well, what I'm going to do is take that 1.20, multiply it out by how many contracts I have that tells me what the overall loss is going to be times 100 on the trade. And then I'm going to sell enough long calls to cover the cost of the short calls. This is a way for me to unwind the position as it's doing what I want and to make sure that I'm not realizing losses on one part of the trade and not realizing gains on the offsetting part of the trade because what really sucks is if you take those calls down for a loss because you want it to go",

Now you've made less money on the long calls. You've already realized the loss on the short calls. You're creating a problem for yourself. So the cliff notes version of the short call management is really simple. In general, I'm just going to try to roll out and up. If I can't roll out and up, then I will sell long calls to cover the cost of the short calls pretty much it. And we need to talk about this thing called the critical strike. So let's get a better idea of the total profile of what this thing looks like. This is using another ticker. This is using rut, which is actually what the example is going to be in. This gives you an idea of how the overall product behaves. We talked about a lot of this stuff already.

I'm going to say, okay, it's starting to rebound. Maybe I think it's starting to slow some strength. I'm not positive about it. But let's say that I think that there's support somewhere around this one 10 handle. Maybe somewhere 111 ish using one of these volume nodes like right here. So let's say it's like right there. I'll get rid of this one to get rid of the noise. Let's say that becomes my floor. So that essentially means that the underlying right now is at 118. And I have like a seven point downside in this configuration. It'd be really high probability of getting stopped out here. But let's just say that that's the downside. So what I would do now is say that's where I think resistance is. If it falls below that and let's say it cracks below 110 giving it a little bit of extra room to move, then it's time to get out.

And I'm going to say, how do I feel about that? How does that fit within the portfolio? Is that too much too little? Do I have enough capital at risk to make this trade make sense? Well, I also need to understand another part of this equation. Where do I think it's going to go? Where's the upside? Here, it looks like the first stop is somewhere in here, like maybe the 122 handle. So then I get to say, what do I make if it hits 122? We go to the analyzed tab. We run over here to 122 and we would make 3000 bucks ish. So what's the probability of me hitting 122 versus 110? Again, you can either do the math or you can use the options change to solve this or you can use something like this.

That's the probability of me hitting 122. In this case, it's 83 0.5, even better than the downside. So you can see what the expected return is based on your near term and then target projections, whatever those are. So you can have a near term target like this. This looks like where the first stop might be. And then if it gets through there, it looks like the second stop might be somewhere up here, like 128. And you can see based on the probabilistic assessment you have on those directions, what size makes sense for your portfolio? This is how I size the trades. So that's the idea of managing the PNL via TA, then making sure that the size makes sense for the risk that I have on. So let's talk about this idea of critical strike. This is an example of kind of a trade lock that I built for these. This is available for all the outlier pro members that are interested in it. And for those that are in there, that's okay. You can kind of build your own by modeling off of what you see here. So what I'll do is I'll figure out how much money",

Then there's a couple things on here I really want to draw your attention to though. This first one here is this idea of a critical strike. What is a critical strike? Well it ensures that where we sell or short option is not potentially locking in a loss. So it in the beginning is very easy. When you first buy your long options in this case, as long as you sell short options that are essentially out of the money when you come in here, then it'll be okay to the upside, depending on what ratio you pick, which we'll talk next, but it's not locking in a loss. Where it starts getting confusing is if in video goes down a little bit. So let's say instead of it being at 118, it drops down here to 113. You're still on the trade, but it's going down. So you have to be a little more careful with what strike price you pick. Otherwise you essentially commit the equivalent of going into here. Let me show you. You commit the equivalent of selling short calls below your long option",

Otherwise you essentially commit the equivalent of going into here. Let me show you. You commit the equivalent of selling short calls below your long option basis. Get this up here so you can see it. So in this example, the long option basis is 117.29. So what you don't want is then to sell short calls below that basis. So the whole point of the critical strike is it makes sure that whatever strike you're selecting keeps you from doing that. Now there's an easy way to do this as well. Again, if you have a platform like Thinkerswim, it'll do it for you. So for example, let's say in video moves around and let's say that we're not looking at these 134s anymore. You're like, okay, where can I sell these short calls? And you're like, well, I want to be really aggressive for whatever reason. I'll say you wanted to sell these 115s. You're like, he's like, okay, can I sell these 115s? Well, if you look at 115, that strike on the PL graph, that gives you, that's a problem because it locks in a loss. Those short calls produce a loss unless you do something about them. So your platform can help you with that or again, something like this can. So what I do is I take the long option",

So what I do is I take the long option basis, whatever I got in it at, I take out the long option value, whatever it's currently trading at, divide that by the long option delta as it sits right now and I add the current stock price. So in the example that I gave for the right, this tells me that regardless of where the rut trading at that point in time, that I essentially need to be above this number in order to not have upside risk on the short options. That's all. So this tells me what strike I can sell the short call at and not have upside risk, not lock in a loss at where I'm at. There's two other things in here that matter to me. The number of short call lots is a really simple formula here. So I take the number of long options I have times the long option delta. So literally all that's doing is accumulating my total delta. And again, your platform will do that for you. So if I take a look down here, this right here, you see this 71292, it tells you your total delta. So in this case, we want to make sure that we",

So in this case, we want to make sure that we never have a scenario that our short call delta is overwhelmed our long call delta. So what that looks like here is if I click this and let's say that instead of selling four, I want to sell a bunch more. Well, if I sell five, then I have 146 delta's. If I sell six, now I have 176 delta's. So you see how this number changes because the other thing you have to remember, again, with these short options is if I sell them and then the underlying starts rallying against me, remember, there's gamma. So if it moves against me 1, then I lose 29 cents. But I also gain one delta. So now it's going to be 30. Then if it moves against me another dollar, now I'm going to gain two delta's. So one and so forth. That's what leads the compounding that can cause you problems. So for example, if this ratio becomes too high, what that tells you is that after a big enough move against your long options, your short option delta's overwhelm your long option delta's because the other thing to remember is as these are going against you, your long options",

Because they can only go to a one delta. So there's starting at a 71 delta and I have a little bit of delta that I can gain. But once they get to a one delta per lot, that's all they can be at. So the whole idea behind the short call lots is just to make sure that you're not selling too many so that you're not creating upside risk. And again, your platform can also tell you this. And the last thing here is the adjusted long call basis. This helps me calculate what the current basis is if I'm accounting for in the money short options so that I make sure as I'm trading around the position, I fully understand what the actual basis is for the long calls as I'm selling them to cover the short calls. That's all. And it feeds into the rest of these numbers slightly depending on what you're trying to track.

It gives me the adjusted basis accounting for all of that. And again, your platform can do this for you. All right, let's take a quick look at an example, pretty simple one actually. So on the 11th of July, the Russell started to break up and out. I was waiting for this for a while. So in this case, I went in and I bought 10 of the 20 September 2050 calls for 120 80. So again, you can figure out the DTE from here. This was a shorter duration ratio call diagonal because I expected the move to be pretty heavy, but I wanted to give enough time to work around, but not a tonne. And these were over a 70 delta. So then notice that there's no short call yet. It's because I was expecting this to be a pretty strong up move. And my goal was to add the short calls when things slowed down right here. So from the 11th of July, I did nothing. I bought these and did nothing. Then on the 17th of July, I decided to sell to open five of the 16 August. So about a month, DTE, 2350 calls. So",

These were around a 30 delta at the time for 2710. So notice what I did here. I bought when it was breaking out and then I waited until it started to slow down. And that's when I chose to sell the short calls. Again, remember, the short calls are secondary to the long calls. So you don't have to automatically put them on at the same time. There's no forcing function there for you. So I took in 13,550 from that trade. Then it was time to hang out for a little bit. Then the Russell started to play games with my heart and it started to come down. So I was just like, oh, interesting. Need to adjust here. So what I did was, and it's because we started falling down below this support level. You can see that I draw them as the product moves so that I'm calculating where I'm watching things. So I saw it flirting below that level and I wanted to see if we would get a close and then we actually got an open and a close below it. So on the 19th, I",

And notice, I only took down half. Then I decided to take two of the 16-Ogged 2350s down for 1040. This gave me a profit of 3350. Why did I take down two if I had five? It's because I want to keep the ratio intact. Remember that ratio I talked to you about. I don't want to cap my upside. I never want short calls to equal long calls. So in this case, I took five of my 10 down that gave me five long calls left. I don't want five short calls against five long calls. I want my upside. So I take some of these down. So this gave me a realized PN all at this point of 32,480. Then on 22 July, it started to move back up. So it looked like a little bit of a head fake. I decided to start scaling back into the trade.

In this case, that took my total debit on this trade of 54,105. And we're now just cruising along. Now, one important note as I'm figuring out the sizes for these trades, like any standard trade, the initial step always includes the initial allocation and then the scaling. As I mentioned, I wanted to start with about the max size I was going to give this trade. So in this case, you'll notice that's why I started with 10. In this case, I only added three because they're more expensive now. I'm being very careful to stay within my initial allocation and scaling rules. So then the unwind on the first of August, we had this big giant red down day. So the next trade was selling five of the 20 September 2050 calls for 280. So that was earlier in the day when we were up here, just as we broke below this support. So that netted 40,000 bucks. And I closed out the remaining three calls at that point. Again, going back,",

So I just took the three calls down because I kind of had a suspicion. I was going to be getting out of this trade based on the velocity. But at this point, I took a pause and that's where you see this PNL here was up until this point, all this stuff. Then we fell below the next support level I had, which was right here. So as soon as we fell below that there, I closed the rest of the position. So I closed the three that I bought here, closed them down here, and I bought them for 180, 35. And I sold them for 175, 30. So I took a loss of 15, 15. So on the total trade, it takes me to a profit of 76K, 63 return on a vested capital. This is one of those instances where as you could tell, it's not like this crazy big 3,000 return on the money. But it's a solid overall gross return.
