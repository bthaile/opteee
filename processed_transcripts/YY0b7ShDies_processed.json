Now there was not a game stop stream this past weekend because your boy was getting over some food poisoning from those haters over at Chipotle, but we're feeling better now and ready to get back caught up with everything that's going on. And there was some interesting news that broke today from Ryan Cohen. I think it broke yesterday. We'll talk about that a little bit later. I thought that we would start with just analyzing where we're at now today with the company and how things look because the broad market right now is going through a bit of a contraction. So some of the movement that we're seeing in game stop recently is unique to game stop, meaning the company itself and the overall movement of shares for the company itself. Then also some of this is literally broader across the entire market because if we take a look at let's say the SP 500 for example, you can see the SP 500 is down for consecutive days. It's shedding. So this is actually the the broader market closing in not quite there yet, but closing in on a correction. About a third of the way they're defining it as a 10 pullback from term highs. So it's moving in that direction, but I think it still has a way to go from the broader market. So some of this overall",

So it's moving in that direction, but I think it still has a way to go from the broader market. So some of this overall weakness is absolutely going to bleed over into individual names like this. Now a couple of things that did surprise me. I fully expected and based on this value area. I think we drew this two streams ago together. So this is a couple weeks old now. So you can see that there was a volume node hanging out here. Lots of transactions at this price level. And I genuinely didn't expect this move that we saw yesterday. I really would have expected us to hang out in this volume node a little bit longer. The fact that we didn't do that in that it's assuming this broader downtrend and now it's posting near term new lows. So it posted a low here and now this is a lower low than this low. So what that means is the broader downtrend obviously is intact and it's continuing. It's kind of big and ugly. I identify with that mostly because in terms of trends, they're normally a little more organized than this kind of like this. This is a less ugly uptrend, right? It's very organized. This is kind of all over the place. There's some levels of consolidation built into",

It's very organized. This is kind of all over the place. There's some levels of consolidation built into it before resumption of a downtrend. So the market is definitely kind of mixed different ways with where it views game stop right now. And when I look at the company itself, a lot of this near term movement in my opinion is now fully being driven by sentiment. This is being driven by short term positioning and a lot of people managing risk, taking risk off not just in terms of individual positions within game stop, but then also individual positions within things like XRT that feed into game stop. We're seeing outflows and movements into defensive names. So until the market starts to consolidate and chill out, which right now I'm still generally bullish on, I think that the impact AI is going to have is literally as big as anything else we've ever seen bigger potentially than the internet. So with that level of impact and prosperity ahead of us still, there's one of the most powerful catalysts I can think of for growth and advancement. Now that doesn't mean that there can't be bear market in between. There absolutely can be because we're trying to thread a needle with things like inflation and now tariffs and",

I still have that on. That's not on anywhere. And I will walk you through what it looks like as of today. And right now it's just kind of like a sit and wait and hold. Normally what I will do is unwind shares as it's going down and a big purpose for unwinding those shares is so that I am what we would call value averaging, taking them down at a profit, and then unwinding them before they turn into a loss, right? So securing a profit and then being able to purchase more of the underlying. Now unfortunately I had done some of that already. And the position is about as trim as I would want it to be given the",

So it's holding a loss right now and I'll walk you through all of that. Now I do want to talk a little bit before we get into that just kind of like the current state of GameStop as far as we can see. And if we take a look we can see that volatility is creeping back up a little bit. So we're seeing over 100 vol here. We're seeing 101 vol in the front. Part of that is going to be from the broader market movement. Part of that is going to be probably from earnings right now, which are expected on 25 March after the close. So we have some ideas on volatility moving around, but definitely entering the equation a little bit more heavily. We can see that there were a ton of calls traded today relative to put 113,000 against 25. But most of those came in below the bid. So sales probably people selling calls against shares. It's kind of late to do that in my opinion when you're selling them now you're kind of selling the calls when they're real low and cheap, which isn't my preferred methodology. But",

But if you're late to the punch or late to the punch, the options chain is quiet a F. I've not seen it this quiet in some time now. So it's 557,000 calls against 184,000 puts nothing in here jumping out at me. This is just very, very quiet. We're across all different expiration cycles. But one of the things that is noteworthy from the open interest distribution is there is some localization in the front expirations, but most of it is actually out here in 17 April. That's interesting because it's not in the next primary expiration. It's in the second primary expiration out in time, which is slightly abnormal. Normally we see almost all of the open interest concentrated in the front individual cycle, but then the second largest concentration typically is found in the next occurring primary expiration. And then we sometimes see stuff way further out in time in the 16 Jan, 15 Jan, out in 27 like super far out. So the fact that it's not here, but here is actually kind of interesting.

So this is looking at a 30-day flow of premium for puts and calls separately. And I want you to take a note as to how this is in flow. If we look at where we had some of those really, really busy periods, you can see that it did start to get a little busy back in January. Then it got super quiet, super quiet. Start to get a little more active in fairly early fed quiet it down. And then it did spike up again, not that long ago, but the spikes that you see now are just nothing in context. So even though that there are some, you know, signs of life in terms of net overall premium traded, it's still just not very much. So the options market has been quiet in game stop for some time now. And it's not a good thing, bad thing. It just kind of is what it is. The company right now is starting to lean more and more on its fundamental positioning. So speaking of fundamental positioning, I saw this post, okay, so what was today? So this, I saw this post pop up.

    "text": "is starting to lean more and more on its fundamental positioning. So speaking of fundamental positioning, I saw this post, okay, so what was today? So this, I saw this post pop up. This was from CoinDesk and CoinDesk had commented that strive asset management CEO Matt Cole urges Ryan Cohen, Chairman CEO of GameStop, to adopt as a reserve asset to adopt Bitcoin as a reserve asset using the five billion in cash that's sitting on the balance sheet. And Cohen responded letter received. This is purely designed to build hype. That's the reality. Now, it would be very interesting if this is to occur into what degree, but the only reason on planet earth, why Cohen would post like that is to build some sort of hype around that idea because he absolutely knows that this is something that a lot of GameStop holders have really requested for some time now is to add some Bitcoin. And I will continue to reiterate the point. GameStop is here because of the shareholders, because of you, because of the apes. Without you, the company overwhelmingly likely would have collapsed. So I do believe that there's some element of him that fully understands and recognizes that and probably builds that into some of the choices he's likely to make. So that's the main reason why he would comment on this, because if he wanted to continue moving in the dark like he's been broadly, then there would be the status quo,",

So the fact that he took the time to comment on this in a way that obviously he's very public, that tells us something about the expected positioning. So it actually would not surprise me at all to see GameStop start to scoop up some Bitcoin. Now I also have to be honest though, I thought we would have seen a little bit of life bleed into GameStop on even that tweet. So if we zoom this in a little bit further to get some context on the volume, I mean, I did expect to see a little bit more life, but the average volume is still bleeding down. And this is probably not lack in part to the fact that Bitcoin itself is performing poorly. So the idea of moving into Bitcoin right now, although it's probably smarter for the longer term horizon. But in the shorter term, it's kind of like, man, you know, depending on when they look at doing this, you might just be buying something that's going down in the short term. That's not super ideal.

So there's probably a little bit of an element of that being tied into the movement that you see here in GameStop. So let's take a quick look at the coverage strangle as promised. So right now I'm still sitting on 250 shares. You can see I'm all the way up at 28.21. So super far underwater, just kind of sitting there holding things. And that is what it is. So I do have two different tranches of short options out. I'm short, the 25 puts in 21 March. These are probably going to have to be rolled. And then I'm short, the 35 calls in 21 March. These are down at like 40 cents or something like that. These can come down to the profit at pretty much whenever I want. So the game plan here is really straightforward. I'm not adding any shares to the long equity position yet because you can see we're already pretty well utilized at 78. One of the things that I might do is when I roll these short puts, I might size these down by one contract. By sizing this down by one contract, I unlock another hundred shares that I have access to to do whatever I want. And in this case, what I would want is as GameStop",

By sizing this down by one contract, I unlock another hundred shares that I have access to to do whatever I want. And in this case, what I would want is as GameStop starts to consolidate and show strength, slowly start nibbling on some shares to build up this position. Now this is the downside. Essentially of managing a smaller position. Like if I was managing, you can see the other coverage strangle that I typically trade. They're larger positions because you need a decent bit of capital in order to employ the idea in its largest and purest form. But even with a really small allocation of 25,000, it's still completely viable. It just means we have to be a little more cautious with the silver bullets that we use and the silver bullets, meaning the remaining money. So the scenario here actually is pretty, pretty simple, to be honest. We're not using a bunch of the total amount allocated to it in the shares. We're literally using only 7,000 of this total 25. So the majority of what we see here is tied to these short puts, which is exactly what I want. I want it as a satellite position. Because right now, this would be something I just continue to hold. There's nothing I need to do with this. The basis is fine. It's a little high, but it's okay,",

So that's all there is to be done here. It's a little bit of taking a tactical pause, letting things move as they do. One of the cool things about trading the coverage strangle is even though this kind of stuff is going on, we still have profits built from prior short options that we've sold and taken in. So we have 692 and puts 353 in short calls. None of this is right home about, but if you think about it, it's about a thousand bucks on something that that's realized profit. And in the time span that I started trading this for you all, it's up about 0.45. So it's not a bad return. That's realized PNL. That's not including what's up here, the extra 142. And this will probably come in at a loss because I'm going to have to roll it. But the point is by trading these options around it, even though it's not doing what we would like it to do, we can still make some money. So that's the game plan is now. If you have any questions,",
