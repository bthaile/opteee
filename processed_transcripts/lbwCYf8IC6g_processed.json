    "text": "It takes longer than you think. People are so misled by the low barrier to entry to be a trader. You just open up a brokerage account via an app on your phone and just start sling in some trades. The issue with that is that it puts us on the exact wrong path and that's why most people fail at this. But if you take a look at the people that actually take this stuff seriously and understand that like any other skill, think of any other skill that you have. If you're an athlete, how long did it take you to get to the level that you might be at? Probably a lot of practices a lot of time talking about it with your friends a lot of time training. It's literally the same thing in trading. If you think about like the 10,000 hour mastery benchmark, that requires five hours every single day, not missing a single day, for five and a half years. Yet, most traders start this thing and after a couple months they think that they're ready to rock and roll. And they're probably not embraced a process being all they're seeing later.",
