    "text": "Music what's up outliers happy Monday quick market update I got three things on the agenda for today I want to talk a little bit about Oracle earnings because as you could tell it looks really really good they closed today at 139.99 and they're trading at 152 and we'll talk about why that's important the next thing I want to talk about after that is the iPhone and Apple because well you know it's always nice to see us get pitched the same thing over and over again over year and then go buy it for sure so I want to take a look at that and then I want to take a look at GameStop because it has earnings coming up tomorrow so I want to see how we're positioning leading into earnings so what's going on with Oracle and why does this matter well to me I think this is really really important because we can see that it's reporting really really well we'll go through some of those metrics in just a minute but essentially for expectations this is the funny part about markets it was expected at a doll and a nickel and it came in at a139 so that's a really big EPS beat as we've seen with a lot of other tech companies but the market is rewarding them and a lot of what they're rewarding them for again as per usual are actually the way that we're forecasting out into the future",
