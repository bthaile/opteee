    "text": "This trader here is a perfect representation of a lot of issues coalescing together that are very common to most traders. They're talking about the loss of their portfolio, how it drew down pretty massively. And the fact that as they do things, the market tends to do something else and they're not prepared for it. And there's two things to focus here. On the first thing is this just reinforces how important it is not to just mirror the common saying of, you know, trade your plan and plan your trade, but actually doing the work to build a plan that you trust is invaluable because that's how you stick through it when things look rough. The second thing is this person is way too focused on the outcome of individual positions and less on the process. Important remember, over your trading career, hopefully there will be tens of thousands if not millions of trades. If you focus too much on that outcome on any one individual position and less on the process, you are missing the forest or the trees. You know, I'll see you later.",
