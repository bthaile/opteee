    "text": "yet my position is realized with profit to the upside we have a realized pl of 365 but then we also have a total pl of up 20 800 bucks again that's nothing to write home about but this happens through scaling into the trade and then also having a little bit of realized pl coming from the option side and then right now there's way more potential pl coming from the option side which will help to position a lot so this is the game plan to trade I bit with the coverage triangle and again you guys will be able to follow along and if you have any questions let me know be an outlier I'll see youall later",
