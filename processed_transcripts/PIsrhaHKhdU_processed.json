So the game plan for today is to walk through some general activity from the week. I want to run through Reddit because, you know, it's always fun to use Reddit as a place to come up with conversation topics. And there was a couple of actually today that really stuck out to me that I think will be interesting conversation points for us. So I have a few of those that I want to talk about. I'm going to grab those pull them up so that we can look through together. And then the other thing is whatever else you want to talk about. So today's kind of like an open session, open QA with whatever we feel like discussing. So that's what I have planned for us. And then we can dive into the rest as we go along. So great to see everybody. So let's, oh, here's another one that looks good. There's a ton on Reddit right now as I'm flipping through these. So let's grab a couple of them. That's so funny. There's always, there's always a ton of people on Reddit that I cannot help but get a kick out of. So we'll look at that one. We're going to look at that one. And then we're also going to",

Sharp in the old sword as they say. It looks like we got some moda Shre black mamba, hater James Pepe gang's in town. It's like the perfect, the perfect group. I think to learn about options to get a little closer to things. And one of the things I was noticing is I was talking to people throughout the week. Oh, our boy Benjamin just hit me up. Would we got here? Interesting. Oh, this was talking about, um, this is Benjamin from the Benjamin YouTube channel. But we were talking about the United Healthcare thing. So he just hit me up about that. That's still unraveling. It looks like they think that he's fled New York. And it's like, no fucking shit. Like shocker that the dude who did that would flee the place that he did it in. It's like the fact that that's even topical. Well, not that's not what Benjamin's saying me.

And because this, this blew my mind. So when we first looked at United Healthcare, it was here. This was the day of the shooting. Nothing happened. Then this, then the day after there was this big massive drop, I was so late to this party because I genuinely believed if there was going to be a big massive move, it would have happened on the day that the event happened. This is really interesting to me that it was essentially delayed an entire day. And today was great for the fade. But this surprised the ever living shit out of me because the shooting happened in the morning. So it's not like it happened at the close and the market just got the news lay. And there wasn't enough time to digest it. This was like early morning on the fourth was it or whatever. So this was absolutely nuts. Now we did see tons of puts rolling on. And I didn't participate in those puts right away because again, like I really thought that if we were going to start seeing this kind of movement,",

And then it was like, as soon as it dropped below 600, then that's like, yeah, grab the puts. But normally for those kind of events, I'm pretty fast to getting something on to trade the news. And that little bit of a head fake was very strange to me. And as always, I aim to let you all see inside the world of what I would consider to be like a actual normal trader. Not everything's perfect. Not everything is top-tick, bottom-tick rarely so actually. It's normally a complete shit show. And we can come up with very simple ideas that end up panning out at some point. But this one was just slightly confounding to me because I really thought we would have seen much more of this style movement here. So in that, I don't want to go too far down the deep end.

But what's gnawing at me is it almost seems like either one of two things happened. In order for the unwind to start, there must have been a series of different approval processes that could have slowed things down tremendously and led to a delay. I don't actually believe that would be the case because we've seen sell-offs happen much faster than that. So I don't think that there's like a fucking one-day approval process. But that's like the side of me that wants to be giving and not think too deeply about the other thing, which is it does almost seem like there probably could have been some collusion among some of the larger holders of this to dump this fucking thing at once. Kind of believe that. And the only, again, the only reason why I believe that is I cannot, I cannot find another explanation that would lead to this because my first thought process was, huh, maybe there was a lot more information that came out from Wednesday into Thursday that then led to this move.

But you can just watch the video and know that that wasn't the case. You could tell that this wasn't like some sort of professional hit, but you could tell that this is something that was at least moderately researched. So it was purposeful for some reason or another. So the idea that, you know, that I just didn't see anything come out over the course of the evening between here and here to justify this being a essentially inside day with nothing. And then this being a day where we opened up at six of six in close that five seventy eight nine, like that's a big move in something like this. And then for it to continue.

I fully would have expected to see some of the move materializing here. And then since it didn't, I was slow to get in not that slow to be honest, but I definitely was slower than I was expecting. I got in just just as soon as a crack below six. And then so it's been a great move. It's been a 50 point move. This will be a beautifully profitable trade. No, no gripes about any of that.

This is a, it's obviously not a haphazard amateur approach, but it's I absolutely would not call professional. Let's look that up really quick though. United healthcare news. I'm just kind of curious what the latest is. And then we'll get into the heart and soul for tonight. I'm just genuinely curious about this. One of these websites that think it might have been CNN. I'm not a big fan of CNN typically, but one of them is done a really good job. This isn't it. One of them has done a good job. This isn't it either. There's a website. I don't remember which the what what website it is, but there's one of them that like it keeps it tally of the news as it comes out. So it's like, you know, it has the news block with what's known at that point. Then a news block, what's known at",

And I think that that was a great time for a lot of people partially joking. It actually surprised me. I'm not even going to lie. Because some people were asking things about like managing risk and reward in a futures trade. But then as we were going through like the basics of futures, they were commenting that like wow, that's a lot. That's really heavy. Which tells me from a learning perspective for those people, the cart is so far in front of the horse.

You're going to lose money. So overall, I thought that that was interesting. But let's take a look. It looks like Jason has a question. Pretty new to options. Can you explain the best strategy in how to select the proper time frame strike price? Okay. Yeah. That's a great question. And there's a there's so much that goes into even a marginally realistic answer to that question. So what I'm going to do is give you an overview first. And then I'm going to give you two videos that are going to hopefully help a lot with this. That video is the first one you want to watch. And then this video is the next one you want to watch. So let's grab Jason's questions. So everybody could see it. And then we can talk about it. And for those that are hanging out in the chat, how would you guys answer this?

I 100 understand why this question would be asked because it's a natural starting point. And this is actually why I made those two videos that I shared in the chat before because this is such a common question. And because it's really nebulous to try to figure out the correct answer. So what I'm doing is I'm grabbing the you already know what I'm grabbing the super duper ugly insane disgusting massive. Look at this.

Nobody handed me this or this. This is shit that I've made after stumbling through the dark trying to figure this stuff out for a while. There's lots of I read a couple really great books, but even those books don't teach you an actual process to build a strategy. They teach you about different kinds of structures, how they behave, but the process of building a strategy is very specific. So the way that I would think about this Jason is I actually would worry way less about what strategy you think might make sense. And I would spend the time, especially if you're new to options, is first and foremost, understand how options work. The reason why is if you genuinely understand how options work, that the question literally will start to answer itself. And I know that sounds great, right? Literally a autonomously answering question, but I could give you like, based on what you said in there, long biased day and short swing, like I definitely could give you things that would make sense for that, but it genuinely wouldn't",

And we all know when I say quick talking about something even moderately detailed, this will probably be a fucking 45 minute bit, but we'll figure it out. The overall process here though is you've done a good job starting to define what you're trying to do. So you're telling me that it's your profit mechanism is long biased. So that means that we're trying to trade stuff to the upside. That's super helpful. You're also adding qualitative and quantitative data around it, not so much quantitative, but some qualitative data, things like day and short term swing trading. So now I understand our time frame. So that starts to inform what stuff might make sense for us. Holding period is a really big input for this process. Now one of the things that I think",

So we are trying to be long. We're trying to be time frame is day slash short term. Swing is one of those things that it can have a million different definitions. I'm just going to classify this as less than 10 days, something like that. It could be a million different ways. So then the question is, what strategy makes sense? Well, what's the next question that we want to ask ourselves here before we can even get into anything about this in terms of what strategies, what structures, before we can touch any of that? What's the next thing we need to ask ourselves? Well, we need to know this. What does this mean? Long. Long is good.

I would take that one step further. It's a great point. But I would take that one step further and I would say it's not even dictated by the strategy. It's dictated by, well, let's take a step back. If you define strategy and structure differently, then fully agree, completely agree with that.

It's better to learn a few mechanics and strategies well and focus on those. That part, I guess it depends on what you mean by all things. And the reason why I think all things is so relative is because you need to have a solid foundation before you touch anything. So it doesn't mean that you need to know every strategy under the sun. I actually am a big fan of simplicity, but I don't think that that is the way to go. Politude says I have a decent options primer. I think we're good. I appreciate that. I'm actually going to kill that. The reason why is because I would have to go through it myself in order to feel comfortable for anything like that being around here. And I've already put out a ton of primer material. People have a lot that they can work through. So I don't think that people need more information at this point.

You can see that if we were to plot this as a slope, this has a steep slope. This has a mellow slope. Why does that matter? Why does that matter at all? Well, it matters because the appropriate strategy can be different based on the type of profit mechanism that we're looking at. So back over to Jason, can you, based on this descriptor that we just went through, can you explain a little bit more about the type of things that you're trading? So if you give me a couple examples of charts or tickers, I can take a look at those. And we can do a very quick analysis of the profit mechanism type so that then you can run the rest from their data. That's not it at all. I had to pop the door for Thor. He was losing his mind.

But I like I promised in the beginning, I'll give you a summary, happily give you a summary because this will apply literally to everybody that's in here. So when we're trying to figure out what strategy makes the most sense, we need to start with the profit mechanism. We already talked about that and the type. The type matters because it gives us the qualitative and quantitative behavior of whatever it is that we're trying to trade. So for example, a breakout is different than drift or even Pied post earnings announcement drift runs or value. These are all different types of a price direction of profit mechanism.

These are all different types of a price direction of profit mechanism. So because there's these different types, they need different things in a strategy that could make sense. So step one, figure out the profit mechanism, you have that. The second is quantifying, qualify the type. That's your first step. Your second step is signals. This is where we figure out how do we find the thing? It sounds like you have that done already. So literally you can apply whatever signals that you currently use today.

We're literally talking about in your example, price direction up, some sort of short term trade. So that tells us we can do some sort of base with long stock with long options. Paul's specifically for short puts. Those would be the applicable base structures to start with. Then from there, once you identify which of those fits this stuff up here, the best, the profit mechanism and the type, then you build a",

So then you take, okay, as I look at my strategy, long stock that's too capital intensive, it doesn't do what I want. That one gets axed off the list for this specific thing that I'm looking at. The next thing is for short puts versus long calls. There's a structural difference between those. Long calls will have defined risk, undefined profit potential. Short puts are the inverse. That's naturally going to back you into a selection point based on this stuff up here. Because again, if I'm trading something that goes up like this, I don't want capped profit potential. I want unlimited profit potential because that's what I'm trying to trade. This massive movement. Whereas if I'm trading something that's a bit slower, then a short put with a wider profit zone might be more applicable. But this is the exact process you have to complete in the structure outlines to see what fits the circumstance best so that then you can decide long calls or short puts, which one of those do I like best?

You can look at things like ratio diagonals, things that I like to run. But for a beginner trader, if you get into that level of detail, you start getting bogged down and stuff that isn't going to make a massive difference. Here's what I mean by that. If I trade a long call versus a short put, let's say it's price direction up and it's whatever it's drift. And let's say the stock goes up 10 points, something like that, whatever. It doesn't, it literally doesn't matter if I did this, if I did this, if I did a call, debit spread, if I did a put credit, it doesn't matter. All of these would make money.

Boer citing is done where you literally physically put either a laser or you look through the bore, the barrel, the gun, and you see where that laser is pointing. We need a different color for the laser. Let's say that we have a cool color laser like pink. And you see where the laser is pointing. Then for your scope, in case you didn't know this isn't a paper towel roll, this is a scope. And you have your turrets. There's a turret here too, which is what you change for a windage in elevation.

So take a look through those. Let me know what tickles your fancy, and then we can do that. So this one, I haven't read through this, but I want to, oh, yeah, no, I like. I definitely read through this one. I remember this one. Let's read, let's read through this one together, and let's see what we can learn. And for those that don't know why I do this, it's because as a trader, you have to become really good learning from other people. If you cannot successfully autonomously teach yourself, you are going",

And for those that don't know why I do this, it's because as a trader, you have to become really good learning from other people. If you cannot successfully autonomously teach yourself, you are going to have a massive problem with learning and not losing fuck ton of money along the way. You have to be able to look at other people's stuff and learn from it. So let's start and see what you guys come up with here. So they're beating their goal, 5,500 into 7,000. I've wanted to trade options, scared, finally decided to trade options. And for myself, thought it was worth to start with 500. In my first month, I've been nervous. In one account, I turned 500 to 7,000. The other, I turned 3,700 into 14,000. I get some FOMO unseen, these huge profits, but I'm wanting to be in this for the long run. I hope I continue to make wise choices to grow my accounts. So what do we think here? What are the thoughts? I have a bunch of things that stick out to me here, as you probably could surmise. Reece says he should thank the flying spaghetti monster, good old GOD or whatever you believe in. And then never trade again. That's awesome. Lauren says he's obviously smarter than me. I wouldn't say that, Lauren. Maybe he just has shorter legs so that he gets",

Don't even worry about the person, their decision-making the way that they think about things. Just look at the scenario and think about the conditions that lead to that scenario. And then more importantly, what could happen here to change this? So one of the what's there's one thing you can do to change all of this that doesn't just apply to this trade that applies to every single trade that they would ever put on in the combination of all those trades in general. So what's one of the things that we can think of? Because what I'm trying to teach you here is the Pareto principle. We can teach things like position sizing. We can teach things like disposition effect. We can teach all sorts of nuanced things that absolutely will help this.

The reason why they don't fix this is because you can have things that fly past a stop loss and expand. I'm not saying that would have happened here. It probably overwhelmingly wouldn't. But that's not a structural fix. There's two structural fixes to this that will literally prevent this from happening ever again, period. The first thing is position sizing that's clear as day. If you size things appropriately, you immediately reduce your risk entirely because based on your position sizing, even if you're selling naked options, you can still size it such that you can reduce the total severity of a terrible move entirely. Even those stocks can conceivably go to 100 or a thousand or a million. It doesn't mean that they go though overnight. It takes some time to get there. So you have time to get out even on naked trades. So sizing, that's the first thing has to be there. The second thing is a portfolio level circuit breaker. The whole point behind that, and I have I think I have a video that talks about this. Yes, here. So this",

This talks about risk management and options trading writ large. But the concept of a portfolio circuit breaker is it forces you. It's just like a stock market circuit breaker. That's where the fucking name comes from. That's why I named it that. I'm just not original at all. But what happens in a portfolio is you can have a bunch of different positions that when you're putting them on, you're putting them on as individual positions. But then something big can happen in the market that then leads to a lot of your positions behaving like the same thing. So if that happens, you can have 30 individual positions that end up all starting to massively draw down together. And let's say that you were putting half a percent on of risk in each that you were going to manage your risk at. But the market starts tanking. They all start moving together. So rather than the 15 total risk you thought you had on, now your portfolio is down 22.5, 25 because everything got correlated and you're like, whoa, what the fuck happened here? The purpose",

The purpose behind a portfolio level circuit breaker is to prevent that exact thing from happening. So the way I do it is I have risk defined for every single strategy. Thus every single trade that goes on, there's a risk management protocol. It can be the size of the trade. It doesn't have to be via a stop loss. So there was a company that I was trading called G-SAT. And G-SAT is tiny. So there was no way that I was going to run a stop market in G-SAT because it's a sub two dollar stock when I got into it. The reason why I don't use a stop market order to get out is because I would get chewed alive on the spread. It wasn't even a big trade. It was like 50 lots and something like this. But that still is a massive amount of the total volume. And we talked about this when a while ago when I was first looking at it, I knew that I wasn't going to be able to put it on a big trade in it.

I was absolutely comfortable losing the entire thing because I knew that I was trading with a less liquid product. So I needed to build something that made sense for it. So there are different ways you can manage risk on individual positions. But you have to have risk management for the individual position. Then the portfolio level circuit breaker essentially applies it at the portfolio level. So say for example, you don't think you should have a greater than 25 drawdown on your portfolio. That means that at 25 drawdown, you start cutting everything. You take a machete and you start hacking and slashing everything. If it's winning cool, take the winner down. If it's losing cool, get the loser off hacking and slashing. Because what that means is something is gone terribly wrong. And because if we're successfully defining the size for each individual position carefully, your portfolio circuit breaker shouldn't hit. So say for example, going back to the 30 trade size at half a percent risk in each, you should have 15 total risk. So if all of those come off at",

So if you have a 100,000 portfolio and you want to use a 10 circuit breaker, that means you can have at most 10,000 drawdown, use 20 you have 20,000 drawdown, 30 30,000, so on and so forth. You could pick whatever you want. The point though is that you have to pick something that makes sense relative to what you're doing. Because if SimOTA says yes, but portfolio total changes daily, I think that doesn't change anything. It literally doesn't change anything. So if you have a 100,000 portfolio and then tomorrow it's 102,000 portfolio, you can apply the circuit breaker off of either of those numbers. It doesn't really matter. But that's the point of doing it as something like a percentage. Again, there's nothing magical about it. Meaning it literally doesn't matter what you base it off of. The point is that you need to have something in place that if things are going against you in such a significant way that you're exceeding what you expected to occur, that's the point of it. So if you want to do it based",

But yeah, that's the point of using percentages is that it remains relative to what you're doing. But the main thing is that it should be a value that you're comfortable with. So if you have a 100,000 portfolio and then you open up the platform and then you see the next day, your portfolio worth whatever subset of that, the nature of feeling comfortable with this and having a good portfolio circuit breaker would be the portfolio as you look at it would be something that you're uncomfortable with, but you could survive.

This to me highlights a bunch of things. The first thing it highlights is somebody that quite like I again, I don't mean this in a rude way, but this is an emotionally unstable person. If somebody says I can't cope with X, it means we're literally not emotionally stable. So the emotional element of this is concerning because trading will expose all of your weaknesses. So if you're emotional for whatever reason, it's going to find it and it's going to punish you for it. Unfortunately, just the reality of markets. So that's the first thing I see. The second thing I see here is this because I got scared. So this tells me that we're trading a completely undefined strategy. We have no defined stop point. And we're putting something on to just see how it goes. We just have an idea and we're concerned more so about what we want to see happen versus what could happen. And I use that phrase a lot.

The way that you avoid FOMO is you build a skill set and a track record that you are confident in your ability to deliver and then all of a sudden FOMO is gone because what does that mean? When I first got stopped out of BILL, I at no point was like, oh shit, how am I ever going to make money in training again? How can I possibly find something that's going to yield me a profit? This is everything I had. That's not that's not the case at all. When I got stopped out of bill, I just popped over to APP which hasn't had a fucking down tick in months and be like, oh yeah, this shit does work. This one's gone just fine. So the point I'm making here is that if you have a process that you're confident in the skill set and your ability to deliver and propagate the process, there's no FOMO because you know you can find new shit all the time. There are literally unlimited opportunities in markets. Some of them are better than others. That will happen. And there are plenty of times that I've seen plenty of traders strike these massively big trades. And at no point do I feel FOMO? I genuinely feel happy for them. I genuinely also",

And there are plenty of times that I've seen plenty of traders strike these massively big trades. And at no point do I feel FOMO? I genuinely feel happy for them. I genuinely also typically feel concerned unless it's somebody that I know is a trader that has a developed skill set. Then I don't really feel concerned. I'm just happy. But the reason why I feel concerned for other people is because you have the folks like this that because of their wise choices, they think because of these wise choices, they've turned a 500 account into a 7,000 account and having a 1,000 return in a month. I can fucking tell you it's not wise choices, dog. It's not wise choices. It's good. You made money. Very happy for that. It's not wise choices that led to this. Fucking luck, healthy dose of luck that does that. So if you get rid of overemphasizing the outcome of individual trades because you know that you have a process that you're confident in, super comfortable with, you know what it can do. Literally FOMO goes away. There's no FOMO. You know that you can find other things. A great example is so far. I got out of so far either yesterday or the day before. Let me see.

So what I do is I've created an approach that allows me to trade bullish bearish longval shortval structural vol. I don't care. And the reason why I create an approach that allows me to do all of these individual things is because I can always always find something to do. That's one of the beautiful components of being a retail options trader. You can move between whatever you need to move between in order to find something that makes sense. So back to this super simple. Take the exit. It's time to take the exit. Set alerts. I literally have three alerts above it. Notice this. If I zoom into a 30 day, I actually have to come in a little closer, I think, because they're pretty tight. So how tight are these alerts? I'm really curious. Not so five day. How are they still not disaggregated? What are these alerts? Oh, I just duplicated. I was like, what the fuck is that? Oh, no, disgustingly compressed. There we go.

So it had crack earnings. It was expected to lose two cents. And it came in making 63 cents. That is a profound beat, profound beat.

Now on an interesting perspective, this one confounds me. APP. I genuinely don't know why it's doing this. So I got into APP here literally when it was like a hundred bucks, it was sub 100. And it is gone from that on the 11th of September to today. It hit a high of 417. That's fucking crazy. I don't understand this one at all. And it's had great earnings. There's no doubt. There's no doubt. It was expected at 95 cents came in at a dollar 25 great earnings. Of course. But this is still a massive change in market cap. If you think of this kind of move as a reflection of the overall market cap of a company, this is a fucking cracked out move. So this thing has been very interesting to follow, very interesting to follow. It's had a bunch of price target increases. This is hilarious. Look at this. I didn't read through these yet.

I don't know if I can get behind a 70 Wagyu stake delivered though. I don't even like Wagyu. Wagyu's fucking gross. It's so it's so fatty. That's why I don't like about it. Wait too much fat. Ain't about all that fat. Don't this ain't it? Here we go. These guys should have a stake. Perfect. This is what we're talking about. This is funny because the place that I'm ordering from right now is it's a place called Chart House. It's like a really nice restaurant. So it's honestly comical to me to like order a fucking stake from a place like this. Make it gluten-sensitive. Is that real? That can't be real. For a fucking stake? Dude, people are weird as fuck. That's so weird. That's not weird. Feels bizarre to me. Don't feel comfortable with that at all. That is not it. Perfect. We have a perfect dinner. We gotta say. Harvey says not even a five. Yeah, no, I've tried it a bunch of times. There's actually, I don't know if you guys know Dave Lauer. This is one of our running inside jokes because I always, I literally always hate.

We'll do it at a one to two ratio, but it's a ratio, Paul diagonal at this point. It didn't have a ratio for a long time. And then I think I sold the ratio when it was basing in here because I foolishly thought that the stock was probably going to settle somewhere around here instead of taking off for another hundred point gain, slightly unexpected. And what I want to talk about is the management of the position. So let me grab this and then we'll talk about, I want to specifically talk about the the short calls. The long calls they're kind of all over the place because I've been scaling in and scaling out just a scotch. So the long calls just leave it for simplicity as they are deep in the money. And they're showing a tremendous profit right now. I think that's an easy way to leave that. So now for the important part though, which is the short calls because those are the ones we have to look at. So we have let's just do one one of the 20",

Let's start first by simply outlining what could be done. So don't even worry about if what you outline is optimal. I actually don't care about that. I just want to talk about what could be done. And again, this is getting you all in the repetition of seeing something in rifling through different things that would be done. And it's because that will help your decision-making massively. You'll be able to cycle through scenarios much more quickly if you get used to this process. So what could be done? Now, I'm going to take away the easy answer of do nothing because that's too easy. That takes just a couple of seconds. So we're going to say that do nothing is already known, understood. So then we can focus our effort on exploring other things we could do here. So let's see rather than like what would Jesus do, this would be like what could Jesus do if Jesus was an options trader.

Del half. And when you say sell half, what do you mean Alex from this context? Because the call option that we're talking about here is a short call. So are you talking about sell half of the longs? And then do what with the shorts? What do you think? Okay, so we sell half of the longs that doesn't solve the short problem because they're still in the money shorts here, right? So then what do we do for the shorts? Elliott says it's a short call. So does that mean it's losing money right now? 100 correct. Nice job. That's exactly correct. So I originally sold the short calls here at 1092. And right now they're marked at 5550 per. So it is a lovely several thousand dollar loss for each one. It's delightful. Really?

Yeah, that's I like that's why I'm that's exactly why we're doing this. And it's totally cool. So the problem that you that we have with your approach there is if we sell half of the longs, it doesn't actually fix or help us with these short calls because they're still there and they're still in the money. So it looked like Reese had the correct, which is something that I do with ratio call diagonals is we can close. We can close the short calls that are in the money. So that's the next thing that could be done here. The way that this works is the short calls right now are losing money. So what we can do is we can sell enough longs because these are in profit. We can sell enough longs to cover the cost of the shorts. So then you're realizing a loss here. You're realizing a profit here that overwhelms this loss so that when you have this net position come down, you're flat or up a little bit, but you're just not eating the loss on the chin.

You're realizing a profit here that overwhelms this loss so that when you have this net position come down, you're flat or up a little bit, but you're just not eating the loss on the chin. So that's absolutely a course of action. I see another course of action for rolling them. I dig that. So then we can roll out. We can go out and up. We can go out, up, size, add size. Those are kind of like the main rolling choices we have with respect to this. So now I think this is a pretty good list, at least as far as what I tend to do with this kind of position ratio call diagonals. So then let's talk about what we should do here. So now the question is what would you do? We have coa 1, coa 2 and coa 3. Which of these courses of action do you like? And I'll walk you through what I am likely to do here. And I also want to talk about another element of this trade once I see what you all are thinking about it. So what do we think? And then in the meantime, I see 2, I see 3. Let's do this. I'll throw it in because there's like 50 folks. So I'll throw it in as a pull. Coa for managing in the money short call. So 1 was nothing. 2 was close longs to finance shorts. 3 was roll. What's",

So 1 was nothing. 2 was close longs to finance shorts. 3 was roll. What's the pick here? I'd rather be skiing says if I can break even on the shorts by selling some longs, that's what I would do. Yeah. Well, and that's the beauty of a ratio call diagonal is because the longs at this point are multiple fold above what I bought them. So by doing that, you literally create essentially a risk free spread almost because you can sell enough shorts then to cover the downside if you're so inclined. But what I like to do if I wanted to realize the profit here, what we would do is sell a certain number of the longs to cover the cost of the shorts. And it would be at a pretty healthy ratio between them. So let's take a quick look. One of the base positions is in 16 May the two eighties. 16 May. We're out here and we have the 280s. So the two eighties are at an 81 delta. And they're essentially sitting at 14. I'm sorry, 14680. So going back to what we were just looking at. We have the 360 call. And we sold those for I think it was 1090 if I'm not mistaken. They're currently",

And the basis on this, there's a bunch of different ones. It doesn't really matter. I'm just giving you the portion there. The main thing I want to show you is this the long call right now for a couple of them. I have tranches at a few different spots. But for the long call that we're referencing here, this one is worth 146. I'm just going to call it 147 and give it to the 90 is just a little easier 147. So these are worth 14700 per lot. So what this means is if you'll notice on these, I essentially need to cover 4540 per lot. So then we can just see how many of those fit into the 147. So if you have 147 divided by 45.4, you can cover 3.2. You can't use 0.2 of an option. So you can cover 3. So what that means is if you sell one of these, it covers 3 of these.

So then all I do is essentially the math relative to the profit. So that this way, I'm ensuring that I'm locking in a profit on the trade. So that means that for each one long call that I sell, I can cover two of the short calls and still have in that profit. You dig? I feel like that might have gotten a little heavy for some people, especially on like an option trading basics. So if that got a little heavy, don't worry. If you have questions, I'm happy to answer.

So I'm actually going to use that as the focus session for tonight, because I think managing in the money short calls is a really solid topic for people managing in the money short calls and six. Because we also did this a little bit yesterday on the GME livestream. So I'll probably add both to be honest. Managing in the money short calls ratio covered calls covered calls are in the money. And then today's managing in the money short calls from ratio all diagonals. So we're learning all sorts of shit about managing calls. This is great.

But if you scroll down to the bottom, you literally can see where it says focus topics as one of these tabs. So if you click focus topics, it'll show you where to get it from. So you can see all the stuff that we've covered at different points in time.

And then you can go find the information that you want. That's the at least that's the intent behind it. So I hope that's useful.

So we have start here, focus topics. We have beginner roadmap. We have excellent, complete. Maybe just four. Lauren says I have five billion questions. My questions have questions. Shoot them.

Because right now anybody that's in the Patreon, they get access to everything in the shop. So what I try to do is just make it like a really great value for what it is. But the deck that I show you this thing, it literally is just all bullshit that I make for myself for like references. There's nothing.

Like you can definitely go on the Patreon shop someday. It's just not done. Reese says how close expiration to your mini short calls for ratio call diagonal. That really will depend more so on how much extrinsic value is left and what the underlying is doing. So the essentially it's less about how close and it's more about the conditions. I apply standard like rolling methodology. So if you take a look at this one is for you, Reese, this video about rolling and this video about rolling. I think those two will be most applicable to you. But the way it works is it depends on if I'm trying to get assigned or not. If I'm not trying to get assigned, I'll manage it not based on time necessarily, but I'll manage more so based on the stock relative to where the underlying is like how far and the money I am or stuff like that. And then if I'm okay with getting assigned, then I prefer to wait until almost all the extrinsic value is out of it. Good or bad. And then I'll either just let assignment go or I'll look to roll them. So notice is why did you let the APP",

So if you take a look at APP, one it crossed 360 was on the third. So one, two, three days post that. And the main reason why I've not done anything yet has to do with the way that we can manage in the money short calls in something like APP. So what I don't want to do and what I try not to do is I'll show you this is kind of an advanced thing. I don't really talk about this. I don't really talk much in most of the videos and stuff that I do because because it's kind of advanced. But it's the most simplistic way to do this for people that are comfortable holding shorts and kind of know what they're doing. So with that caveat, this is what I like to do. If we take a look at the 360s here, right, they still have over. I mean, let's just calculate what the extrinsic value is because I actually don't even know what it is.

We'll call this like the quick nav. There are several tabs. Use these links for quick navigation. Reset that. Well, what do I need? Three rows. And here. Wait.

It's because it doesn't really matter quite that much. Although the way I'm about to show you is definitely more capital efficient. So one of the things that happens when you try to close these is you have to pay this back. Right. So let's say, what did I say? Sold them for 10.90. 10.90 is what I sold them for right now. They're running 55.50, I think I said. So what is this 45.40? So when you go to close these, you have to pay this. So even in the scenario on the long calls, and let's say that you're going to make what did I say? 10,000 per? No, 10,000 per? I'm a fucking remember. They're at 147.00. So it'd be 10,000 per. So even though you can sell a long call for 10,000, and then you can buy these back. So let's say that, let's just say that you have one in one to make this a simpler scenario.

Now there's another scenario that's a little more complex. Let's pretend that it's now expiration day. Let's pretend that you don't do anything. So on expiration day, if you do nothing, you sold these for 10,90. Let's just pretend that they're trading for 55.50. And let's say you let it expire in the money there. What will happen if you let it expire in the money there? Well, the first thing is you keep this. You make 1,000. You make this for a lot. You don't own any shares at all. So you're going to end up short 100 shares. And it's going to be at your basis, which is 360. So then you have to close this out. So you're going to go into the open market.

So let's do 401.5 less. The 360 gives you 4150 times 100. Oops. So you notice, do you notice something here? By taking assignment and then closing it at spot price, you save yourself a little bit of money, a tiny little bit of money. Now, the time that I typically will use this is if I'm trading something that's really illiquid, or if I'm trading, if I'm literally willing to roll the dice on something, that I'm going to try to roll, which is going to be the case here. My plan here is, because the other thing also, you have to add is whatever the carry cost is, because you're going to be charged interest for the carry, which is going to reduce that take. So compared to the 4540, this will save you a few bucks. Again, trivial. It's really not much. That's why I typically just talk about trading the longs and the shorts.

    "text": "you a few bucks. Again, trivial. It's really not much. That's why I typically just talk about trading the longs and the shorts. Now, if you wait until expiration and then there's essentially no extrinsic value left, then it doesn't matter, because this is more optimal if there's no extrinsic value left. But this scenario, it allows me to not care about early assignment because I know how this process works, so then I can wait until as much of this value comes out as humanly possible. So the more efficient approach, in a case like this, where early assignment is not a fear, it's not a parable, and I don't really care, because I would unwind the long to make sure that I'm still getting out of a profit, by waiting until much more of this extrinsic value comes out, is really, really important. Because again, if we're trading at 401, 50, and our basis or our strike is 360, that means our total intrinsic value of this is 41, what was it, 4150 I think, 4150, and this is trading at 5550, 5550. So 5550 less the 4150, that leads us our intrinsic value. So notice this assumes no further move though, it doesn't matter if there's a further move, because you have the longs. So if there's a further move in this scenario, it doesn't, you're already at essentially a scenario where the longs are going to overwhelm the dollar for dollar move, because you move to",

So if there's a further move in this scenario, it doesn't, you're already at essentially a scenario where the longs are going to overwhelm the dollar for dollar move, because you move to a delta one product. And then if it goes down, that's just bonus. So if you can buy it to close at a slightly better point, all the better, but you have a built-in hedge with the longs that are already deep in profit. Does that make sense to Moda? That's a really important point. That's the only reason why this works, at least the unwind scenario that I'm talking about. And then in the meantime, back over to this, what I'm showing you is that there's still a decent amount of extrinsic value that I don't want to buy back yet, because I don't care if I'm assigned, because I can unwind early on the short calls, like if they fall super far in the money. If I care about early assignment risk, I have to watch these and make sure that I'm getting out when extrinsic value starts to be low, so I can eyeball a roll. But the other thing is there's a ton of rolls available right now. So if we look at the trade as it sets, even if we wanted a roll right now, again, it's trading for 55.50, and we go out to",

So if we look at the trade as it sets, even if we wanted a roll right now, again, it's trading for 55.50, and we go out to like 42 days or whatever. You can see that I can straight up improve my basis 10 points. I can go from the 360s to the 370s by just going out a little bit further in time, like 30 days from still having 14 days left to go. So the roll opportunities, because I'm still very close to spot price on something like this, it gives me more choice and flexibility. So that's why I'm waiting here. And that's why that the scenario that plays out doesn't matter because there's a course of action built in for literally every scenario that could play out. This is the part that I talk about with trading that genuinely, hopefully, emphasizes why trading like good trading itself genuinely should be very easy, because all of the work for trading is done before, literally before you put on the position. And if you do a good job, then trading itself is exceedingly simple. All right, so I think I'm all done there.

Well, you could do that like think or swim has paper trading as a paper trading version. You can log into or you can use on demand. But my biggest recommendation for paper trading anyways is genuinely to do it this way. Exactly. This is exactly why I'm doing it this way. And the reason why I'm doing",

Exactly. This is exactly why I'm doing it this way. And the reason why I'm doing it this way is because you maintain the data. And that's a big drawback for people that paper trade through an app or something like that is you lose the data. And that's really detrimental. So this is trading at 14. 49. And what I'm going to do is not fully optimize this, but I still will partially optimize it. So what that means is I'm going to change my entry time to be closer to market close. So we'll do like a 12 normally like 1230. But I'll just do like yeah, 1230 is closer to what I would actually do. 1230 maybe even closer 1245. The reason why I do this is because I want to do my best to isolate the actual earnings move itself. So then what I do for stuff like this is I'll add a comment for myself. And I'll be like um entry time at 1245. Pacific time. Something like that. Anthony says don't you still have the data if you use on demand not so much. The reason is because on demand you're going to run out of money in the portfolio and whatnot. And you can't you can't connect any other",

I think I have to use my other account. That's kind of annoying. Yeah, I think I need to reach out to them. I thought that I moved the email to this. All right, CLSK. Yeah, let me email Tyler super fast. All right. So let's see. Oh, my dinner just got here. That's great news. So let's see what we have in here though. So the expected move was. Wait, why is this you're like this? So the ex, wait, was that the expected move? 14? 14.6. And then of the past 12, there's one before five six, six of the past 12, exceeded. Then I would jump in here, go to six, these, you can look at something wrote like a 10 delta, eight delta. What's the closest? Yeah, we have eight on the side. So we're run the eights.

And the reason why I'm adding this stuff is so that later I can aggregate a bunch of data. This would be stock percent realized. This will be we already have the expected range. So this would be stock low range. Stock high range. So what these do. It'll allow me to run a little bit of a broader analysis.
