    "text": "Build a habit and don't stop. This applies to the primary wealth levers like saving, investing and expanding your income. One of the biggest mistakes people say is like, oh, I'll start investing when I have X number of dollars. Literally fuck that. Start immediately with whatever you can afford. The most important thing early on is not you saving a thousand dollars to invest. It's you building the habit that you value investing. Once you build that habit, sure, then you can start worrying about how to invest optimally, stuff like that. But getting into something like an index ETF, which is what most people do anyways, retirement account, primary brokerage account. The first thing is to build the habit. Don't wait until you have X number of dollars open up a brokerage account and just start the process. Then you can begin optimizing, but the habit's got to be built first. Being all our seal later.",
