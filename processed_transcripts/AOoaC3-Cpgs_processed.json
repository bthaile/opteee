    "text": "I was telling my wife, we were on a walk last night. I told her, you know, that I was interviewing a day. I was stoked to chat with you again. And I was telling her about how, you know, I would email you, right? And obviously you're insane with your emails that you still have, you still sent a lot of emails to people. And she asked, she was just like, how does he do that? Like how many emails does he do a day? So from my wife, Mel, to you, how do you do that? And how many emails do you send a day? No, I can't tell you because you probably have me committed. Like you would have, you would have some institution here with a truck in a few minutes. Like basically, you know, putting me in a straight jacket and taking me away. It's a sickness. I've been doing it now for 24 years. You know, people are cool about it, but hundreds easily hundreds. I'm good about like, I only email back and forth with customers. Like in other words, like professionals in the industry, like I don't do professional events. Or I don't, I'm very careful about avoiding the professional stuff. I only want to deal with customers.",
