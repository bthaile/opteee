    "text": "hey everyone eric here we got some small stacks updates to get through so wanted to jump into those very quickly in short the account is actually pretty allocated a little more than i was expecting it to be but i like what i have on so let's go to the screen okay so right now the account value is 5917 utilization's 4092 and we're about 70 utilized total p l not just over 9 900 bucks and that represents a 15. 15.5 return um and right now we have 255 out which is a 4.31 return on the account so let's see the uh the trades that have been made first off if you'll notice ford is down so i took that entire trade down um total p l in it was 124 after closing the short calls and that's a 13.7 percent return on invest capital in that trade so that was pretty much an easy win as far as i could tell i do like ford still it's something that i might revisit but just seeing the move that it made it essentially made the move that i was looking for it to so i didn't maintain exposure so if we take a quick look and kind of see what i'm talking about when i first entered ford it was quite a bit lower um definitely in the sevens like mid sevens and or maybe yeah definitely mid sevens i don't totally remember what the price was",
