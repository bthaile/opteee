    "text": "hey everyone eric here so it's a little bit later that's why i got the lights on but i'm trying to do my best to stay a little closer to when i'm making the updates to the small stacks account so that is why we are currently hanging out even though it's a little bit later than usual so let's jump over the screen and take a look at what we did now if you'll notice i currently have no uh coverage strangles or cash secured puts out where we were empty on that as of right now so today i took down the xle 29 puts and i paid 58 cents it was a little bit lower than what i wanted but realistically it was a it was pretty close to 20 capture and the trade was uh on for a little bit longer than i was anticipating so the reason why i wanted to take this down is as i was seeing the market kind of moving around today i said it before i really would prefer not to be an xle long term so i kind of you know took the took the few bucks i could get out of it and and went on my way typically i would have left this on a little bit longer but like i said when i saw about 20 capture in um in a week or so 10 days ish well eight days um i i didn't want to",
