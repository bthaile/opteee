    "text": "What is the absolutely most important thing as an obstinate trader? Most people will say things like risk management or being disciplined. And the reality is neither of those are correct. The ultimate thing that matters to an obstinate trader really is edge. The ability to create returns that meet your objectives. You can have really great risk management and just slowly lose money, but managing the risk all the way down. You can be super disciplined, but that doesn't mean that you're able to find a market effect to monetize. This is a super common misconception. Edge is the only thing that matters a front-for-an-obsession trader. Now, obviously, you need to manage your risk. Otherwise, you might not be able to extract the edge long-term. You need to have discipline. Otherwise, you won't follow the process to extract the edge. Those are things that are given. But you have to have those in pursuit of the thing that matters the most, which is edge. So you got to go find Edge in an honor.",
