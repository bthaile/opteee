    "text": "What up outliers quick market update. We got two things to look at today. We got rocket lab USA post earnings and then we have GameStop. There is some really interesting options activity over the last couple days that I think we should talk about. So we'll start with this quickly and we can see overall our KLB has been up and to the right. This is a three month daily chart. If I take us out to a year, it's essentially been parabolic. So what's going on in here? Well, if we take a look at some of the internals before we pivot over to earnings and we talked a little bit about our KLB last night, but this will just touch on some of the higher level components. It's been in favor again for the past year when you see stocks moving like this so strong for extended durations, they tend to build a lot of momentum. That's actually why momentum is a very tradable factor in the stock markets. One of the few things we can like truly quantify isolate and put positions on based on that effect alone. And if we just peek through some of the key news as we see like this, this here, they had a solid earnings. I don't think there was any big shock there when we were looking at the options last night leading into the earnings. It was definitely bullishly positioned. Now what's really interesting though is the move",

I don't think there was any big shock there when we were looking at the options last night leading into the earnings. It was definitely bullishly positioned. Now what's really interesting though is the move today was different than I would have expected. The main reason for that is I wouldn't have expected it to break all the way up here and then get rejected all the way back down. That is a lot of selling pressure. So those are people that are really, really happy to say to just see this up here and they're getting out. They're fading out. Now understanding how many of these people are folks that have built in profits, I would imagine that would be a lot of them because there's just not that much volume that actually transacted above this current level. It's just not that old of a company. Most of the volume is transacted down here at like 466. So these are people that got in down here. And I mean, they tripled their money plus, which is, I mean, they actually, if they top ticked it, I forgot that it broke above 20. So they literally would have five times their money and then some. So the overall movement today was really interesting to me. I didn't expect to see quite this shape of a candle. And we need to see how it goes tomorrow.",

I didn't expect to see quite this shape of a candle. And we need to see how it goes tomorrow. My guess is a lot of the sellers probably got it out of their systems because otherwise, I mean, it definitely could have trailed down more on the day. I don't see any reason why it wouldn't have otherwise because if you look at the volume today, overwhelming volume, 120 million shares traded today, their five day average is 41 mill, which includes this day, obviously. And then 18 mill before this, the five day average was 20 mill against 14 mill. So just an explosion and volume and the majority of it was sale, 95 and it stayed up there, which that was pretty interesting for me to see. So let's take a look at the options. We knew that there was some pretty heavy call skew coming into the earnings release. And if we break this out by expiration, you can see that it was about two to one calls to put. So there was definitely people playing this to the upside, not massive positions, but big enough for sure to appreciate pretty handsomely over the move. And these are really short data options. So a lot of them are going to be coming off soon. And on",

And these are really short data options. So a lot of them are going to be coming off soon. And on a longer term time frame, it still maintains pretty heavy call skew. So overall transactions today, 308,000 calls. And we can see 22 were at the bid or below. So sold 30 opened and 46 somewhere in the market, probably a mix between these. I have to imagine lots of people taking profits, especially on these shorter term options, because there's not a giant incentive to hold these 15s into expiration at this point, even if they're far in the money. It's just a little bit more risk. I mean, who knows? You never really can identify what the rationale is for a trader. So interesting move here altogether. Now from a quick broader market perspective, a few things stuck out to me. Tech is still really strong. So you can see comms up here and then tech sector here. They're still definitely leading the pack. And then we still see this really weird breakdown. And I can't put my finger on it between staples and discretionary. Still hitting highs in staples is still trending negatively over a three month period, which I just, like I said, I can't put my finger on it. It's weird. And real estate struggling,",

And real estate struggling, not a big shock there are utilities kind of trending sideways. I think you're going to find some really isolated strengths within utilities, right? So we know Trump's policies really favor things like oil production stuff like that. It's not going to be as favorable to things like solar wind, definitely not wind. As you could tell, Trump is not a fan of the whales being hurt. If you guys aren't familiar with the joke that I'm making there is from the Joe Rogan podcast, really spend a while talking about the impact of windmills on whales. And I have to be honest, I had no idea that that was a thing. That was actually new information for me entirely. And so in healthcare. So healthcare is not happy. Big pharma is not looking good. And we've seen this being carried out pretty consistently, right? So if we look at Pfizer, I mean, it's just barely catching a bid down here.

If they start getting in front of their advertising spend, I don't even know how big of an impact to be honest in or fearing with the advertising spend. A big pharma is going to be a typically it's a big deal. But I'm also I just can't think of many consumers that are like asking for specific drugs based on an ad they've seen. Obviously, they're smart and they're spending the money for a reason, but that part I can't figure out. But I also think more importantly, if they're giving donations and stuff like that to other news agencies, it does create misalign incentives, right? Because if I'm Pfizer sponsoring parts of your show, you're more likely to not necessarily emphasize stories that besmirch my brand. So that part I think is more likely to be detrimental.

I know some people are a little dejected that it's not, you know, a moaning right now, but this in and of itself in my book is a pretty strong victory, right? Like look at this candle today, even in GameStop, it's this like invert hammer, but the thing that's important is take a look, big volume, big sale volume, and it's still really held its own. Now does this mean it's starting to roll over? It's hard to tell. It's a little early to tell in my opinion we can see from an RSI perspective. It's momentum is slowing, but we can visualize that. So what I thought was a little more topical from GameStop is actually this. So if we take a look at the options volume and I want to specifically look at these that came through. So the 40s on the 12th, which is yesterday, they got tapped not over 3000 times, right? So you can see a 3000 lot that got pushed through here that was worth over a million dollars.

Like there's other people that trade and it's always important to keep that in mind. Because I know a lot of people are just fingers crossed, hoping that it's him stepping in. And I would love to see that to be clear. I'm in that same camp. But I always make that comment because if that's the basis that you're making trading decisions off of that's. It's just a little more difficult to rationalize. But in terms of days to expiration strike selection, this is very much in line with what we've seen from him historically, right? So we can see that there's 3000 of them here, 1400 of them here. And again, these are the 17 Jan 25s. We can see another 2000 here. We can see another 1000 here. We can see another 800 going through here. So like there's tons of these 40s getting hit. And again, it's a little further out in time. So this is not like some sort of really short term yellow-esque",

And again, it's a little further out in time. So this is not like some sort of really short term yellow-esque style trade. This is deliberate positioning. And this is deliberate positioning to the upside. Now I do find it a little bit interesting that there's no sale on these. And the reason why I find that interesting is because if we take a look at the different times that these were transacted on the 12th and on the 11th, it was kind of towards the end of the day. So 26. So somebody had the opportunity to get out at about a 10 gain overnight. And they kind of look that in the face and they said, I don't think so. I'm going to hold. So it's clearly to me, in indication that somebody's kind of trying to play a bigger move, not just playing the short term first move that's put in front of them. So we'll have to see what these materialize into. I'm curious what you all think about the overall options activity in here. It's questionable to me. It looks interesting, but this is definitely larger trades coming through with some level of conviction. If we take a look over the last couple days specifically, the majority of these, this higher volume that's several hundreds of",

If we take a look over the last couple days specifically, the majority of these, this higher volume that's several hundreds of thousands of dollars essentially has been from the 12th on. There's definitely some trades earlier than that, but the bulk of it has been in the last couple days. So I'm keeping a really close eye. I didn't see a lot popping off today on the 13th to any significant degree, but as always, you know, I'm poking through markets, seeing if anything is jumping out, looking interesting. And so far, it looks like there's a building phase going on, right? So we can see that down here, another thousand of the forties got hit on the 13th. They got hit yesterday at a couple of different times. So this is building out a position of some sort. We'll see what it looks like. As always, any questions? Let me know. Be an outlier. See you later.",
