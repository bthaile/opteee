We are going to talk about all things macro economic geopolitical and as we were talking about just for a few moments before we started the recording, there is literally no shortage of things to talk about. So before we dive in, welcome back. Great to have you. Hey, I would great to be back with you. I always enjoy our conversations and looking forward to another great one today. I always have an opportunity like I was telling you right before we started to selfishly learn a lot. So I fully intend to take advantage of that. The first thing I wanted to start with, I don't know, we don't have to go super far in the weeds depending on how you guys like to dance around the topics. But did you catch the debate last night? And was there anything in there that stuck out to you? And then just for the listeners really quick, we're recording right now on the 28th of June. So there was a debate last night between Biden and Trump. Yeah, look, we haven't written about the presidential election directly. We're not a political newsletter, although on various podcast appearances, I have made the case, which I think is just an obvious statement of fact that Joe Biden is seen up. And the man is not there. That's shame for Joe Biden. And it's a scandal, I think,",

And the man is not there. That's shame for Joe Biden. And it's a scandal, I think, for the Democratic Party. And for the cadre of enablers that have surrounded the president and have decided that they thought that they could trick the American people into thinking that a man who is obviously suffering from serious cognitive decline could not only be president, but run for another four-year term. And I think, you know, Epsilon Theory, Ben Hunt put out a great piece this morning, which basically said that this was a narrative shifting event. It was a watershed moment in US political history. And look, this is not a partisan statement. Like Joe Biden's mental decline, even in the four years, I mean, the signs were there in 2020, but in the past year, it's become undeniable. And he is unsuited to be president of the United States. And if you disagree with that, then that's like on you. Like you could be a lifelong and many lifelong Democrats were panicking last night based on the reporting that we've seen the commentary on CNN and MSNBC. You know, I didn't watch the debate.

And the US is the world's largest energy gigapower. And so the presidency of the United States, of course, matters to the work that we do. But I say this, like as an outraged citizen, like, who did they think they were like, this was obvious to you. I assume long before last night that Joe Biden has, is not fit to be president. Like, how is it that in 2024, it took a nationwide televised debate, and forget nationwide, worldwide televised debate, for what has been obvious to anybody who's being attention to suddenly become the thing that everybody already knows, to put, you know, Ben Hunts' language on the situation. And so I think it's very sad night. Sad for the president. Sad for the party. Sad for the country. Sad for the world. What a joke. I mean, there's no other way to describe it. Last night was a fiasco, and the enablers who allowed it to happen ought to be ashamed of themselves. Now, if I'm not mistaken, the debate last night actually got shifted originally.

And I was seeing something, and again, I'm really not interested to go super far down the political rabbit hole myself, but there's a specific macroeconomic tie-in that I'm going to lead us to. One of the the thesis I've seen floating around is that we, the debate was shifted to potentially highlight Biden may or may not be suitable, and to provide time for a replacement, if the Democratic Party wants to look for a replacement for him. Now, from macroeconomic view, who are the people that you think can have the largest impact on the energy sector that would potentially replace him? Have you guys gone down that rabbit hole yet? Are you kind of waiting to see what happens first? Oh, sure. Of course. And we've seen those. I don't want to use the word conspiracy theory because I don't like that phrase, but I've seen those hypotheses, which would explain why this debate was so early. It's pretty rare to have presidential debates before the conventions. And it was odd that Biden insisted on having this debate, or the people around Biden, based on last night, it's pretty clear, who isn't making various critical strategic decisions around the Biden campaign.

So I don't doubt. And by the way, the coordinated response from the sort of left part of the media, sort of universally saying that Biden needs to step aside was, was interesting, although who could argue based on that performance that isn't the the only logical conclusion that you could make? Now, I'm seeing reports today that Biden has just dead-facely insisted that he will remain on the ticket. And absent intervention, 25th amendment, or whatever it is, there's no legal way for the Democrats to switch jockeys at this point in the electoral process. And if Biden insists that he will continue to run for president, then I don't understand absent intervention and sort of involuntary intervention. How anything happens? And in fact, I was talking to a few friends, you know, obviously everybody just grouped texting and so on. I don't know how it can be that you are unfit to run for president, but you're still fit to be president. And so if he's unfit to run for president, doesn't he kind of have to resign? And he's not going to want to resign. And so he's going to run for president. That was kind of my deductive reasoning.",

Like, how can you not be capable mentally of running for president, but still be capable of being president? I don't think anybody is thinking about that right now. They're all just thinking about, well, he could just pull out of the race and, you know, they'll have an open convention. Not so fast. He's still the commander of chief of the United States of America. Right? Like, that's actually more important than running for president, being president for the next seven, eight months or whatever it is. Matters. We're, by the way, we're in the Cusp of World War three. Like, if it ever were to matter, it would be now. So I don't understand like the logic either he can run for president. And based on last night, I don't know how anybody absent blind partisans could agnastically observe what occurred last night and come to a conclusion that this man is prepared to be president and then leave him in office until January.

And I think because of that as a constraint, I'd be shocked if he pulls back. They may try to pull it off. But again, if you would, like that, that's why I think the team Biden, whether it's Jill or whoever is making the decision, you know, behind the scenes, they know that if they don't run, they can't stay president. Now, the steel man, the same argument, do you think that their focus on staying president would be so powerful that they would risk a higher probability of losing a Democrat in office? I think if there's anything that we have seen from these 80 plus something year old politicians as they never want to leave. It's actually, it's funny you bring up that point on the age because the other thing I was going to ask you about is again, kind of tying it back to the evolution of energy. To me, it seems really interesting that we continue to have older minds, even because Trump's not young either. So, yeah, like we have a series of older people that are vying",

And I'm curious if that kind of just function of age and paradigm that comes with that age has an impact on the way you view the next four years of energy as compared to what it could look like if somebody more, I don't want to say progressive necessarily, except as a bunch of different connotations. But it's more just temporal in terms of their views of energy and the evolution of energy. Do you think that the age bracket, even that we're talking about, has a pretty significant shaping function on what the energy picture looks like for the next four years? I think the age bracket, the dominant feature of the age bracket is impossible for anybody who's been in Washington for that long to not be corrupt. And so, you know, in my ideal world, and look, I get that there's a whole half of the country that think Trump won the 2020 election. I think it's important to acknowledge that that there are important questions in this regard. And many people hold strong views that the election in 2020 was not on the up and up.

And if they believe those things, they think Trump deserves another shot. And I think if you just look at the dominant way in which he run, he won the Republican nomination. It's pretty clear that a fair number of Republican primary voters must believe that because they sent him back to the ticket, despite all of the baggage, real invented, fabricated, or otherwise, that the man undeniably has. And so he's the Republican nominee. And I think that needs to be respected. Now, in my ideal world, which can't exist, wouldn't exist, we would have had a three-way race between Gavin Newsom, Ron DeSanto, and Joe Manchin as an independent. And from an energy perspective, they all have different views. Although even Gavin Newsom has sort of come around to being pro-Nuclear, and I think is just playing footsie with the Renable Movement in California because of political necessity, and that if he were to be the selected candidate to replace Joe Biden, that he would move to the center, I mean, he's, I wouldn't underestimate Gavin Newsom as a national political",

I think he's a very talented politician. Do I agree with more than 10 of what he proposes in California? No. But again, as an agnostic observer with no skin in the game, I think he's a formidable political candidate. And in fact, there's a bit of a contrary in view that last night was bad for Trump because it makes it obvious that Biden needs to be replaced and his replacement can only do better. But a three-way race between Newsom, DeSanto's, and Joe Manchin, would have done two very positive things for the country. One, it would have presented the country with a choice among sort of that next generation of political leaders. I mean, they're not the youngest crowd, but they're certainly not in their 80s, but also two. All three of them can complete a sentence. And they have well-articulated and formed views on important topics like energy.

I really share the same sentiment that you do in a lot of different ways. You mentioned a little bit earlier, and I wanted to ask you about this because the last time we spoke, you discussed this concept of World War III here, you're talking about that were on the Caspavet. And then I think last time we were talking, you were of the opinion that we might be even a little bit further potentially might have kind of already kicked off. I would just love an update on that perspective and see if that's still your view, if there's new inputs that factor into your assessment of that, because obviously for me with a military background, the concept of World War III is very scary.

Everything that you see going on with Russia and Ukraine, the capabilities of these drones, the idea that you can have an infantry battalion out there that just gets swarmed by a few hundred drones that cost pretty cheap relative to what they are is terrifying. Yeah, look, look, here's, I think we're way way way closer to World War III than is being reported in the West. I'm not sure if you saw this or know this, but last week, there was an attack on the missile that appears to have been partially deflected and exploded and the cluster munitions, at least some of them fell onto a beach where civilians were enjoying the sun in Kramar, which Russia claims to be part of Russia and Ukraine claims to be part of Ukraine. And so it is contested territory to be fair. And Russia accused the US of directly being involved. And I think it's pretty clear that those attackums missiles require US guidance systems and drones to help pinpoint targeting and so on.

When the Cuban Missile Crisis was unfolding and the world was on the edge of a nuclear exchange, it was wall-to-wall coverage. And the West, how many people listening to this know what I just said would you guess? That- Yeah, I would imagine the vast majority do not. Correct. Everybody in Russia knows it. And in fact, the feeling in Russia is that Putin is being too weak and too slow to respond to this event. And that once again, he is not being as hard line as many in Russia would like him to be. Now there's this belief in the West that Russia is a one-man show. I think that's a false belief. Putin has his own political constraints.

And by the way, like if there were to be a quote-unquote regime change, which many in the West would like to see in Russia, I suspect that the person who replaces Putin would be hardered line. And that would accelerate sleepwalking into the abyss as we seem to be doing. So we have this situation. We have reports of North Korean troops being sent to fight alongside Russia and Ukraine. The Russians have warned that because the U.S. is arming and the West and NATO are arming Ukraine with advanced missile systems that they will do the same to enemies of the U.S. in various proxies around the world. North Korea would be on that list, for example, given the tensions with South Korea and the U.S. bases that are just over that border. The Houthis, the Iranians, pick your favorite. There's an important Iranian election happening today. And depending on who wins, it looks like there might be a similar treaty signed between Iran and Russia that has recently been signed between North Korea and Russia.

And I think it's important to know what's being told to the citizens of our geopolitical adversaries. Look, if the president of the United States, which is kind of funny to say, after our first discussion, honestly believes that the U.S. should declare war against Russia over the Dombas, then we should have a debate in Congress and declare war and send our troops in treasure over there and fight for it. This sleepwalking our way in and sort of partially doing things, but pretending as though we're not directly involved is only escalating the situation. I would like for my Congressperson to cast a vote before my draft eligible children are pulled up and sent to war. The U.S. Constitution was designed such that Congress declared war.

And I could assure you, who didn't know who did it? Xi Jinping knows who did it. The Iranians know who did it. We didn't. I mean, I think it's pretty conclusive at this point.

If you look at Seymour Hersches reporting on the matter and the complete lack of the ability to pinpoint who did this dastardly thing, I think the evidence is there that we did it.

So just to be clear, just be clear. Okay, let me give you the full evidence. In the weeks before it happened and when the war broke out, Joe Biden explicitly said at a press conference that Nord Stream will not happen and we'll make sure that it doesn't happen.

And there's reports by reasonably credible people that the U.S. did it. The Dinos have been relatively flaccid. And in the end, if we had strong evidence that any other actor was actually involved in this, don't you think we would have seen it by now? I mean, I think if there was evidence of another actor, I would agree with you. But again, like I wouldn't at least just in my personal opinion and you get more informed than I am, I just I don't disagree with the inference you're making. I just think it's a leap to say this conclusively happened. I mean, I just think that at some point you have to decide that at least all the players involved believe this would be true. I think it is conclusive that Russia believes U.S. will have the pipeline and you could draw that conclusion by what Putin said to Tucker Carlson in their interview.

That's how science works. You propose a hypothesis, you test it against the evidence. If nothing nullifies it, that hypothesis becomes a theory. And unless and until there's definitive evidence against that theory, that is the operating assumption of science. And so I'm sort of coming at this from a scientific perspective, which is I've been waiting for somebody to nullify the hypothesis that the U.S. will and to the Nord Stream pipelines and there is no evidence that we didn't. And the theory that we did fits all of the observable data. And so until somebody comes up with a nullification of that, I think we need to operate on the assumption that we did. And so maybe I was a little looser with my original characterization of it when we first went down that road, but I think it matters. I think like everybody sort of wings and smiles and knows that we did it. And certainly the Russians believe that we did it.

And you were talking about this just growing breadth of escalations and tensions between Russian US. So going back to this broader war three hypothesis, I have to then preemptively ask, like, do you still do you still view mad as a theory or working theory? Or do you think that that's potentially going by the wayside here? Because you're talking about nuclear escalation, but to me, obviously, then the next logical inject there would be mad. Yeah. So for those that aren't familiar, mad stands for mutually assured destruction, which was a core foundational sort of strategic ambiguity between the two sides, allowed that to become the foundation of Daytona until the Soviet Union fell apart.

And the US certain leaders, who I find there are comments to be rather dangerous and reckless, are saying things like, hey, it's a great return on investment because the Ukrainians are fighting the Russians and we're weakening the Russians, but no American soldiers are involved and so on and so on. What's the Russians? This sounds all very rather cynical. And we saw the Russian Navy sail to Cuba this time and dance around a little bit outside of Miami. And who knows how serious that was.

They hold within their capability the potential of doing existential damage to the United States. The reason we don't want Iran to get the bomb and the reason we don't want North Korea to get the bomb is because once they do, we have to treat them differently. Russia has the largest and most sophisticated nuclear arsenal of the planet. It's beer than ours. It's more modern than ours. There's no scenario where if we escalate to a nuclear, we're going to shoot all these things out of the sky. In my view, I'm not an ultra expert. I think it's not certainly not a risk worth aching. Give me another example. The dangerous analogy that I see going around is that this is akin to Chamberlain appeasing Hitler in 1939. Hitler didn't have nuclear weapons. Neither did France. Neither did the UK. And if the three of those countries had massive nuclear arsenals, I suspect World War II might have developed differently. This is not Chamberlain.

That is a really important thing that people in the West, I believe, are being quite flippant about. The Russians are not being flippant about it. The messaging is very clear. This is existential to them. They have nuclear weapons for a reason. If NATO keeps interfering or participates directly, they are not ruling out using nuclear weapons. Why have them? If you can never use them, we're launching. We gave approval for Ukraine to launch Western missiles into pre-2014 Russian borders. That was a big nodow for decades. We wouldn't tolerate it. Imagine Russia was providing missiles to Mexico when they were launching them into Texas. Now, look, if you're from Ukraine, all this is very enraging to you, what I'm saying. We don't have a treaty with Ukraine. They're not a NATO member. We might like Ukraine, we might think that Putin is acting in a gastro-ly way.

Let's present it to Congress. Let's decide as a country that we're going to avert the embark on a kinetic war with the nuclear superpower over the Donbass.

We're not having that that's in that look at might sound like I'm a stickler for the rules, but we have rules. We have a constitution. We have Congress. We have separation of powers. There's a process. When Japan attacked Bill Harper, what did Roosevelt do? He gave speech to Congress, asking for a declaration of war, which Congress do, did. Great. The Swede's supposed to work. Why are we doing that now? We kind of want to have it both ways.

Last night's debate is the lens through which we watched last night's debate is this lens. How could we... What does Russia and China and North Korea think when they watch that debate? We are living in very historic times. It's amazing to me. We watched CBS, ABC, NBC News, CNN, even Fox. Nobody's talking about what happened at the foreign ministry in Russia. Everyone in Russia is talking about it. Why aren't we? We're just going to wake up one day and there's a carrier sunk. What do we do then? It's not impossible, by the way. I don't know.

And, addicuriosity, when you were talking about that derailed missile over the beach, I just googled it out of curiosity to see what would come up. And I didn't see any US news media in like the first 15. Yeah, so blackout. Yeah. I think it really eludes the dates your point on where the conversation is happening and where it's not. It's. I actually, what I believe happened in that event is Ukraine launched a series of attackings missiles into Crimea, into Crimea at military targets and Russian air defense system either partially deflected or caused the missile to deflect and unintentionally exploded over civilian targets, which happens in war. I happen to believe that's what happened. The Russians are openly stating that this was a deliberate act of terrorism by the Ukrainians, facilitated by the Americans. Now, I don't happen to believe that's true. I'd be shocked, for example, if US were to allow the attackings missiles to be used in that way.

But we're not having that debate. We're just sleepwalking into the abyss. Yeah, into your point, I'm looking at an article from the Moscow Times and it says Russia's defense ministry said Wednesday and Kiev bore responsibility for deliberate missile strike on peaceful residents, which it said used US missile, US supplied missiles. Yeah, that cannot be targeted without US drone technology and satellites and so on. And I also saw that he has apparently given that go ahead to shoot American drones out of the sky in the Black Sea, which the US would probably say is an act of war because they're flying in international waters.

Well, and I think that's one of the interesting components about just general narratives is you're talking about both from Russia's perspective, but also the US perspective. I think that's the one of the difficult parts when trying to keep track with stuff like this is you guys probably know better than just about anybody is how intensive it is to actually identify true information from wherever media sources surround you because this is something I mean reading further on this article, it starts talking about a terrorist attack and they're opening an investigation. So to your point, very clear narrative being told on their side. Yeah, interesting. Well, we wrote a piece called mapping the war where we address this issue.

Of course, that's fine. Like that's normal. Everybody's biased. Nobody's free from it. Not the least a bit bus. But once you get an assemblance of what the truth actually is, and then you could observe how it's being reported, and then you see what happens in the weeks ahead where the early truth that you learned becomes reality and sort of conventional wisdom at some point, then you could begin to trust certain sources. And we've developed a cadre of sources that we used to follow the war. And we're only following the war because of its impact on the energy sector and also the potential that my house could get destroyed in the nuclear holocaust. So that's kind of important to me too. But like after a while, you begin to see like, yeah, like this paper is nonsense. Like the economists and the financial times are reporting just does not reflect reality sometimes.

Propaganda is a legitimate tactic of war. Like we had huge propagandas in all the wars that we fought. And that's perfectly normal. This perfectly sensible. But as a free thinking person as an analyst, your objective is to try to sort of cut through that propaganda and find out what the truth is to the extent that you can. And in many ways, the internet has made that easier and harder. There's an enormous amount of signal and there's just as much more noise. And so the ability to sort of separate the two is a skill worth learning. Yeah, what a great point. And I'm glad that you walk through a little bit about the process you use to navigate that because I think that that does become a daily skill set for people.

So the world is not decarbonizing. Interesting thing happened this week. June 20th was kind of like a holiday for us here because the energy institute released its statistical review of world energy for 2024, which is encompassing of data from the 70s all the way up to 2023. And we learned some very interesting things. One of the things we learned is that the consumption of oil set a new all time record. The consumption of coal set a new all time record. And the consumption of natural gas basically tied a record from a couple of years ago, but is sitting at an all time high. And in fact, this is a stat that will blow people's minds, especially when measured against the propaganda around renewables that we have been fed. The world added 7.5 exit jewels of fossil fuel energy in 2023 compared to 2022. And only added five exit jewels of renewable energy in 2023 versus 2022. In other words, we added 50 more fossil fuel energy than we did renewable energy, which is not something you would conclude from reading the economist or",

Our long-held view is energy is life. All humans everywhere want a better life. It takes energy to improve your standard living. Therefore, every molecule of fossil fuels produced will be burned by somebody somewhere and local restrictions against such activities. Only change who gets the benefit from it. Most of the western countries, well, all of the European countries in the European Union, like they've not produced any meaningful amounts of fossil fuels. So the, I mean, Norway and the UK aren't in EU and they both produce a meaningful amount of fossil fuels to be fair. But the balance of the EU produces no fossil fuels. Therefore, their behavior is irrelevant to carbon emissions because every molecule of fossil fuels produced will be burnt. And since Europe doesn't produce any, they can't stop producing and therefore they can't really bend the arc of carbon emissions. Indonesia, China, India, Pakistan, Brazil, they're going to develop. And if we don't burn oil, they will take that oil at a slightly lower price than would otherwise be and burn it themselves. And they are. And that's what we're seeing. The world watched what Europe",

The world watched what Europe did and stopped listening to what Europe says when the energy crisis hit Europe and they reverted back to the coal with a speed and efficiency of the evacuation of Dunkirk. And they took the appropriate lessons. And so they're burning more coal or burning more oil. Natural gas is, you know, and by the way, the US is like the total hypocrite on this. We produce 20 of the world's oil and 25 of the world's natural gas in 2023. Who are we to tell the rest of the world? We know that demand is gated by production and we're producing. And so I think it's a farce. I think the world is not going to decarbonize. We might slow the rate of growth of the consumption of fossil fuels, but we're not going to decline. We're not going to stop consuming fossil fuels. There's seven billion people that don't live in the G7 that would like to have standards of living that are comparable to the G7.

I mean, I think there's a core group of hardcore mouthingians who would like the world to use less energy and for the world to have less people on it. That's nowhere near the majority. I think majority of people were brainwashing school, went to university, worked for government, or worked in public affairs at a BDC company where branding is all that matters and they're not trained in science. And they haven't really thought through the issues. And they believe the nonsense that we can create a utopian world of energy abundance with just solar and batteries. The grand perpetual motion machine where battery materials are magnetically appear and don't need diesel to mind them. And so on. And you know, vast majority of people have no understanding how the grid works, the difference between base load and intermittent. Why, you know, inertia in the grid is being degraded by the forced introduction of solar and this is causing not just the reliability",

Why, you know, inertia in the grid is being degraded by the forced introduction of solar and this is causing not just the reliability but the quality of electricity to degrade and this is causing end consumers to have serious problems in their manufacturing and so on. There's a giant fallacy which we're reporting on next is that the grand sort of conflation that occurs is that we look at a temporary period of the cost to produce solar when it's released sunny and there's too much electricity and we don't know what to do with it and the price goes negative. And we can flake that with the average delivered cost to consumers of electricity and anywhere where solar is not anywhere. But in on average where there's more solar prices go up, solar is not cheap. It's expensive to incorporate solar into existing grids and you can't create a grid based on just solar and batteries that is economical because batteries are too expensive and the materials don't exist. And so we've reached this point where we accept a degradation of the grid so that we can all sort of slap each other in the back and pretend like we're doing something to save the planet.

Did you see that? California is exploring the idea of mileage tax versus a gas tax. Yeah they have to because look EV. EVs are great for California. By the way, I lived in California and I didn't drive more than 100 miles a day. I don't know the EV. It's sunny there all the time. It's not winter. Batteries don't do well in the winter. But electricity is expensive in California. Again we're just running some analysis like California. If there's one place in a rover solar should work as California. Right. Why? The North and Mount of Sun. Lots of land that people don't live in. And the electricity demand scales with the solar cycle.

California is the largest producer of solar in the country as a percent of their generation of electricity like 40 percent plus or minus. And they're the second most expensive place for electricity for consumers. Like it's solar or cheap. Why are Californians paying the most for electricity when they have the most solar? It's and that's where it should work. Look solar can never work in Maine because the energy needs in Maine and the winter come at night when it's cold and the sun isn't shining. And so there are certain spots of the country where an electric vehicle and even some solar makes sense potentially. But like to say that Alaskan should be driving electric vehicles is to admit that you have no idea what you're talking about.

And and the next piece is tentatively titled No Solar is in cheap and we're just going to give you the three arguments you could use at the holiday dinner table when that annoying relative of yours struts their green bonafides. When you think about the evolution of solar do you think that there comes a time where we could have enough storage capability acknowledging that that uses a lot of fossil fuel to produce and maintain the storage capability. But if we do have the ability to build enough storage capability that if we did set up really large solar farms that we could offset a meaningful amount of fossil fuel usage. So there's a couple of ways in which it can work in theory and it's important to acknowledge those because they demonstrate what's possible and what's not. So Norway gets an enormous amount of its electricity from hydro. And hydro is yeah they they are probably the country that has perfected their energy policy more than any other.

They develop their oil resources for export and they save the profits by developing those resources for future iterations in the sovereign wealth fund in a very mature and conservative way. So Norway has enormous hydro and one of the things about hydro it's relatively easy to load follow. And so hydrogen dam or hydroelectric dams hydroelectric dams hydroelectric dams act as a giant battery. You can keep more water behind the dam or let a little bit more water out as the ebbs and flows of the intermittency of renewables demands. So that could work and to an extent it could work with some of Norway's neighbors because they export electricity. But in a year of a drought they wouldn't want to export that electricity and they would put their neighbors at risk if they were depending on this giant battery. Now that's one snare work could work because that's a huge battery that doesn't require materials. Having said that we're not going to go about damning all of these rivers in North America.

So water storage behind a dam as a battery enables a certain amount of intermittency renewables to be introduced into the grid with minimal description. So they see that point. In a world where we make a meaningful dent on US for example we would need batteries. Now there has been some instrument technologies developed that could again enable more renewables which is thermal batteries which take excess electricity during times words being overproduced and they stored in the form of heat in a relatively efficient way and industry could use heat. So that is again an exception that proves the rule that it shows you certain narrow ways in which you don't have to have expensive batteries with lithium and you know all the other metals that go in them that are nickel and cobalt and so on.

But there's room if you had to. Now I don't think we have to because if we truly cared about carbon emissions we just build nuclear plants. But we don't. And so is there a world where a certain amount of solar isn't all that disruptive and might even make a bit of sense short. We're not absolutists. And might that be politically worth doing just to sort of appease the carbon counters and move on and let industry do a thing maybe. But I don't see a scenario where well let's put this way. One of the things we've called for and others have as well and I should give credit to an outfit called the Manhattan Contrary and who writes a pretty interesting and provocative blog.

I believe it has everything to do with energy. Even immigration is about energy. If you have a high degree of immigration, then the GDP per capita goes down. Right. And so like there's no way like what did Joe Biden do at the first sign of elevated gasoline prices in the USM to the strategic petroleum reserve ahead of the midterms? This champion of the environment emptied the strategic petroleum reserves, which made gasoline prices lower than it would have been, which meant the man was higher than it would have been. If he was willing to lock the talk, he would have embraced 10 a gallon gasoline because in some people's minds, that would have accelerated the shift to electric vehicles. He didn't. He emptied the strategic petroleum reserve for political reasons. And he was corrected due so as measured by the political outcome of the 2022 midterms. Right. I mean, if gasoline was 6 a gallon heading into October of 2022, the Republicans would be in charge of the Senate and the House by white margins. The emptied the strategic petroleum reserve cut the price of oil in half, brought the price of gasoline to around 3 a gallon nationwide, which is politically important and palatable. And the Democrats outperformed in the midterms. I think there's a straight",

And the Democrats outperformed in the midterms. I think there's a straight line. And that straight line, that example proves what will happen. For example, this is a giant shale field in California called the Monterey Shell that nobody knows about. And people don't even really know how much is there because nobody's looking because everyone just assumes you can't really do that in California. At 300 a barrel oil, we could do that California. The pressure to do so will be very, very high. So ultimately, the elasticity of demand for life is infinite and energy is life. And all humans have where I want to hire standard living. Even those of us in the US that are living a comparatively pig-ish lifestyle compared to the six or seven billion people that are struggling to make ends meet every day. I think the Btu per capita use in the US is number, amongst the large countries, number one by a wide margin, a few small countries that out-consumers on a per capita basis. But meaningfully, we are between four to 10 times bigger energy hogs than the average developing country in a global south. Are we going to give that up? No. So I don't know. It seems like an awful",

It seems like an awful lot of wasted time effort and money to get to the answer that it's obvious and dictated by physics. It almost goes back to that conversation we're having earlier about going up multiple sources to sort out the truth, because the messaging you hear, especially I'm in California, especially the message you hear here is all about how do we decrease energy use and we're going green and all that stuff. But exactly as you lay out your case there, it's very clear that there are lots of instances where people are having a dialogue about something esoteric and then what we're doing is what we're doing. So you kind of have to collect data from different sources to actually see what's going on. Yeah, I agree. Look in California is a unique case for a lot of reasons. And blessed with a disproportionate amount of technology developments, the Silicon Valley and a good tax base and so on. And an amazing set of resources. But you know, California, as we said in our piece here recently, California has similar energy reserves, oil and gas reserves to Texas. Texas is a global energy superpower and California is a flaccid energy",

Texas is a global energy superpower and California is a flaccid energy vessel. This is political choices. California benefits from Texas directly and indirectly because Texas keeps the lid. The premium basin is keeping a lid on global and national energy prices, oil being the former and natural gas being a lot in the US as a latter. That's not anything California is done, but the Californians benefit from that. That's fine. Texans benefit too because they make more money than they would if California was developing the resources at the same rate. But California, the only difference between California and Texas is politics, right? And so it's certainly an ideology. We're about at time here, but last question I want to throw a while you was looking at the tail half of this year. What are you keeping your eyes on? What's most interesting to you? I think the outcome of the November election has to be top of mind. I think whether or not things escalate in Ukraine or the Middle East or China also has to be top of mind. That's one of our concerns after watching last night. Last night did not make such prospects less likely. I believe they made them more likely. Both of those events",

Last night did not make such prospects less likely. I believe they made them more likely. Both of those events are what we would call singularities. We're the laws of physics, so the laws of economics break down. It's very difficult to model what comes on the other side of that. If the US election is hotly contested in both sides or half the country believes the other sides stole it, that is a risk. There's a successor risk in the US. Like the US isn't a very bad spot. Like the democracy situation in the US is troubling. The disparity between the bloke and Washington DC and independent minded states has never been larger except perhaps at the time of the Civil War. We're understandable reasons. But we are here again today. I think Texas in particular, the successor risk is a black swan event on our board of little higher than most analysts as measured by probabilities. The election being a mess or war escalating are two very difficult things to model what happens after you go down that path. We try our best to model the odds. And hope and pray for the best.

I am so thankful for the opportunity to catch up with you again and thank you so much for taking the time to share your perspective. I obviously will throw a link to your sub-stack in the video description. Is there anywhere else you want people to be able to look out for you? Yeah, the primary gate portal into all things duneberg is duneberg.com now. We managed to acquire that domain name and objective of squatter from it. For a really stupid price, but you know, or tidy some I bet. Yes, by you know, the market value of duneberg.com grew as testimony to our work, I suppose, and so in a way it was a compliment, but it was a painful one.
