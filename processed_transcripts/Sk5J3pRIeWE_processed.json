But the name of the game is do not repeat mistakes and do not allow anyone mistake to blow you up. There's no reason for a retail trader to blow up their account other than their sleep at the wheel. You need to exit when you have two big of losses, assess what happened and then come back to it. The market will take your money every single time. The in-autler CL there.",
