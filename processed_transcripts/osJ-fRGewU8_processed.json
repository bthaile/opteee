    "text": "The Greeks in options trading, they're way more mysterious than they actually are. They're kind of like the instrument cluster to your car. It tells you details about the instrument that you're using. So for example, we have Delta, which tells us the rate of change of premium. And so on and so forth. So there's no inherent edge in understanding the Greeks. It's kind of like there's no inherent way to avoid an accident if you can read your instrument cluster. However, if you cannot read your instrument cluster, you might overheat your car and it might stop working for you. So the point is, you have to know the details, but it doesn't inherently lead to making profitable decisions. That still has to happen on its own. So take time to learn the Greeks because you're gonna need them to build your trades. But just remember that there's no one baked in edge to them. Be an outlier, see you later.",
