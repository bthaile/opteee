    "text": "hey everyone eric here hopping on to do a very quick small stack segment made a few adjustments today and um i'm trying to do my best to keep the videos in terms of the adjustments a little bit more real time based on some feedback i got and it's it's good feedback so the idea is to try to make sure that i'm sharing regular updates with specific information for the trades so that it's easier for folks to follow so today i ended up making a handful of adjustments so let's jump over to the screen and take a look the first one is i exited out of xlf today and what i ended up doing is closing the trade out for a little over 50 max profit um i had the 22 and a half puts i sold those for 54 cents and i closed it today for 24 cents so essentially just moving money around there taking in money when i see it and i offered exposure in xle so let's take a look real quick at the two trades xlf as you could tell just made a small move up so for me that was just a pretty simple profit management in that scenario i like to manage at about 55 max profit and in general if i see 30 plus pr 30 plus percent profit in the first week i tend to take a look at the trade as well now what i will",
