And again, you can see that in the net highs lows. You can see that even in something like the RSI that I use, the RSI with moving averages. So if you take a look here, you can see RSI passed above the MA starting this day. And then RSI has been, they've both been positive sloping with RSI remaining above. I'll make the MA a little bit darker so that it's easier to tell the difference. I don't really like that is. Just making them a little bit thinner. So you can see that the RSI has been riding above this. And again, it's not just this one day that it did. It's been above what the MA positive sloping. So my broader point here is just to continually remind you all a big part of what we do as traders is look at what's happening in the market. And we come up with probabilistic assumptions on what we think may or may not happen. That's not predictive. We don't know. But we can take guesses. And if we can wait those guesses slightly to have even a minor probabilistic edge, whether that's in terms of the frequency that we're correct or the size",

You can profit from it. So this is all to summarize that the move that we're in so far, that again, no way expected a gap, but this didn't just like happen overnight where it was an overnight gap. A great example of that is actually the COVID bear market that definitely and I've been pretty vocal about that one. Is that one straight up did catch me by surprise. We take a look at the total market performance here. We'll see if anything sticks out to us. Tech comms both gapped up. There wasn't really anything else in here that I was like, oh, yeah, this caught my eye. The difference between discretionary and staples. Do you notice how discretionary actually had a pretty solid gap day here, whereas staples continued to trend sideways. So this is a decoupling of the normalization of this relationship in a really short term timeframe. It leads me to believe that the market is pretty significantly vying off of what happened this past weekend. But this goes back into what I think is continually",

It leads me to believe that the market is pretty significantly vying off of what happened this past weekend. But this goes back into what I think is continually worth noting that we are in a very emotional market. I said that enough now where I'm actually starting to think and I've talked about this on a couple of recent podcasts where I'm actually thinking that that's becoming just an increasing artifact of how things are now. Just the standard volatility being higher because of things like high frequency trading systems because of things like algorithmic trading. I think all of those different factors can lead to the market experiencing larger moves than what we might typically expect to see. And again, my benchmark really goes back quite a ways. But the reason why this is important is because as fast as consumer discretionary is gapped up today and made this pretty strong move. I see no world where it could not just roll right back over. So because of that, the carry over to the portfolio is I think right now carrying a mix long short delta's beta weighted delta's to the S and P 500. I think that that tends to be wise. So now let's take a look at just some of the market internals and see if there's anything that jumps out at us. Tesla",

We can see that I mean, I've been seeing this pop up on the overwhelming majority of the scanners that I run for anything that has trading activity or premium based activity. It really is kind of incredible. Now, there was a trade that I was talking about a little while ago. And this is a really silly trade, but I ended up putting it on because of what I was talking about at the time. And it's really just a pot odds style play. And Tesla has been obviously sent down out of the stratosphere back down into the grass. And it definitely has started consolidating here, right? So we can see that it kind of approaches this bottom. And then we get a little bit of rally rolls back down towards the bottom and then you know starts rallying back up and out. I still again don't think Tesla is anywhere near out of the woods here. But if you recall, I don't remember what day the stream was again I do a stream pretty much every day. So I don't always remember when I said what? But it",

And again, the reason why for TS L L is not really for the leverage. I actually didn't care that much about the leverage. I liked this more so for the price because you can put on a very, very specific size trading here relative to account size. This isn't something I'm just trading in my own account. This is something I'm trading in a couple family member accounts. And don't worry, I don't tell them that I'm trading two times leverage. Tesla, right? That's I would be fired as an investment manager that Joe care obviously is they don't pay me shit. So because they don't pay me shit and because there's no compensation in me for managing their accounts, I then take that as freelance to be able to be a complete derelict both in my portfolio and theirs so that we can all just lose money together.

So what I do for this is I trade longer term calls mixed with shorter term out of the money calls that can lead to a significant profit potential. I'm actually going to probably prep a quick little video about this specific trade. I got to find that clip where I was talking about the current spot for the stock, but it came down to a monkey level analysis, which is this is pretty low. It hasn't gone lower. Tesla still is a viable company, not like this all this near term sentiment and the people trying to like trash the business and trashing people who have the cars, which is complete bullshit, by the way, that's ridiculous. But that stuff aside, that doesn't define the company and the company is still doing well. It's just always been a wildly volatile company. You go back. Like this movement is not new to Tesla.

So and a lot of this has to do with the industry, believe it or not, like the automotive industry, if you look across the past three years on most things in the automotive industry, it doesn't look good. So a lot of people take a look at Tesla and they're like, man, you know, Tesla is like really sucking here and like, they're kind of not there. Definitely way more volatile than names like this. But because of that volatility, there is a trade opportunity. So yeah, it's really just long calls pay paid through the nose in terms of volatility. And this goes back to something I've talked to you about previously, where depending on how you're choosing to trade, you always need to understand volatility, but how much you care about volatility will change depending on what you're trading and what your approaches. Because even if you pay through the nose and overpay massively on volatility, like I did, you get into TSL L calls. If you get a 20 move in a day, it doesn't really matter. The ball can contract as it did and the trade doesn't really care because of the doubt the delta change is so much greater. So it's something to pay",

The ball can contract as it did and the trade doesn't really care because of the doubt the delta change is so much greater. So it's something to pay attention to because traders notoriously as they're getting to like an intermediate level understanding of options, they'll start over optimizing for things that really don't necessarily matter as much as other things. But they think that they're doing something really smart by again, like the things like never buy vol if it's if volatility is expensive or implied implied volatility is above like 30. Like those kind of platitudes, they're meant in good taste, but those kinds of broad platitudes give you broad platitude performance, which is going to throw out the baby with the bath water all the time.

I want to run through some of the the broad news from the day, anything that really stuck out to us here. So I haven't read this yet, but. So stocks rallied on reports that said the upcoming reciprocal tariffs next week would be more targeted than previously stated in narrower than initially planned with some countries exempt and existing tariffs on steel and other metals, possibly not being cumulative. The market reaction to this kind of headline is in saying. The",

The market reaction to this kind of headline is in saying. The reason why it's insane is because again, this is stuff we've already heard, but here's what's more important to me. What do you guys think you guys tell me what do you think happens if some of the news such as steel and aluminum tariffs, because I was actually listening to. CEO from some aluminum company, I forgot the name of it earlier talking about this. They're literally saying like we don't know if the tariffs are going to be cumulative yet. Guess what gang. Times coming up, when do we know right like the fact that that is in unknown right now to me is not good. That's not like a bullish thing. It's the kind of thing that I have a pretty sneaking suspicion. And again, I'm curious what you think if it turns out something like these metal tariffs are unfavorably stacked on to one another or not. That could be a massive problem because right now they're trying to figure out, for example, if there's an existing hold on. Okay, it was just an alert from a stock screener, but it's just a recap for the day. I thought it was talking about the tariffs right",

But if it turns out that they're going to add the tariffs on top of what already exists versus just have, you know, whatever the total number is.

And the primary message I've heard from him across all of the pieces of content that I've listened to and like just to give you some context with respect to Trump tariffs.

But more wrapped around trying to even the playing field with places that and again, I'm not arguing if the playing field is even uneven. I'm talking just from the lens he's been communicating to us. You can take it as whatever you want. But everything that I've heard so far from him really seems to be that he's been messaging that he's trying to even the playing field with respect to trade relations with other countries. That's why I mean, let's just take a look at it. I actually don't know what it is right now, but we'll have our market analyst, AKH, Hatchup, T hook us up. So create an analysis regarding the current tariff picture between the US and EU. Summarize all existing and current tariffs. There's severity. Because a big thing, we'll see what this says. I'm actually very curious because the only the kind of main talking points I've heard in the loose research I've done.

Anyways, back to this. My hypothesis here is if we start getting unfavorable news in perceptions regarding some of these tariffs, I think the market is violently goes the other direction. That's my idea. So let's see, no, I don't want these. I don't want the tariffs being placed in 2025. Summarize the tariffs that existed prior to 2025. It's given me the upcoming retaliatory tariffs and stuff. I'll summarize that for you guys just because it's still topical. So on 12 March US implemented 25 tariff on all steel and aluminum imports, including those from the EU. And then Trump indicated plans to impose a 25 tariff on a broader range of EU goods with specifics, TBD initial countermeasure from the EU. It announced retaliatory tariffs targeting 28 billion worth of US exports. The first phase initially set for one April includes a 50 tariff on US bourbon whiskey. Implementation day 20 March EU postponed the implementation of these tariffs to mid April, aiming to allow time for the negotiations and to avoid escalating the trade conflict by mid April. The EU plans to impose tariffs on 18 euro 18 billion euro",

Lauren says I do believe he also wants more things produced in the US. That's a that's a big thing. But so the production component of it is actually a little bit different than the upfront tariffs as well because the tariffs on different countries is one side of things. That will still impact the trade with those different countries, but there's obviously a method for domestic companies to completely circumnavigate the tariffs by domestic production for some of them at least. The Flavis says it's Howard Lutnik versus Peter Navarro. Navarro is into the terror policy. They're flying by the seat of the pants. I don't agree with that. To be honest, I think again, I think it is completely reasonable to have different perspectives and preferences on things. But the reality is what even in the prior administration in the one before that in the one before that in zone and so forth.

The Flavis says market sentiment is shaping their policy which doesn't really bode well for a coherent policy. Could you produce literally any evidence to that effect because I've not seen that. If they were creating policy based on market sentiment, there would not be tariffs. Right. That literally that entire announcement is what sent the market into a correction that's not market friendly tariffs are not market friendly as you can see. So again, I think that those kinds of just talking points. It sounds. The Flavis says there aren't really tariffs yet. What are you talking about? There are tariffs.

And Flavis says they pause them based on the on the dive in the market. What did they pause? What tariffs did they pause based on the dive in the market? Where do you got that? Where he says they don't get F about markets. Yeah. I mean, I would argue that what you see reflected in the markets is exactly what's happening. And it's that this isn't like a series of policy decisions being made by market. By caring about what the market's doing. Now some of the things and again, being an objective analyzer, some of the things that Trump has said that I do find interesting with respect to market impact are things like telling and starting to pressure big daddy J pal to start cutting rates.

Right. That's what I'm saying in thank you for the data point bubbles because just listening to the Flavis, which again, no, no shade or no issue with the Flavis just a very common thing that you'll notice with people that prefer one side of the information field is you'll get like one side talking points. But there's like a very purposeful not talking of others. And again, I'm not saying only the left or the right do this. They both do this. It sucks. It's miserable. That's one of the really cool things about being a trader or an investor though is the market really doesn't care that much about left or right.

But like you can see the red and the blue on the app. So I actually use this all the time and it's because as again, a rational thinking human being, I don't need some sort of media agency to slowly slew thin their opinions and what I should think I really just want them to report the fucking information and then allow me to arrive at my own conclusions.

Now the next thing is let's take a quick look and see if there's any questions from the pro folks and it looks like we're good on that.

They're still completely inverted, but they're starting to orient in terms of slopes. The earnings is set for after the close still quite a bit of volatility in here leading into earnings. A little on the high side, but not much. One of the things I've updated on my vault here is I've started including ranges. So high low and average. And the main reason for that is because to give me some context over what the ranges for wall work compared to what it is now. That's actually been really, really useful. I like that addition a lot.

So let's just postulate now. Are you talked to me a little bit more broadly about the impact like what kind of are you thinking Florida based tourism companies are like Disney. I don't know if Canadian visitors are like big constituents of that. But okay, so analyze the Florida tourism industry across the state. Break down the percentage of non US tourists. Then overlay with the percentage of US tourists. The interesting question. I think in general most of what I'm seeing. Yeah, this is exactly what I expected. It's literally exactly what I expected. So one of the things I'm noticing with the Canadians is and I don't blame them, but like the Canadians are riled up. They're not just upset at the trade policy, but they're kind of mad at Trump or the way that he's doing things, which again, I don't blame them. Trump has been pretty inflammatory. So not not looking to not looking to deconstruct that in any significant way, but this is the thing to keep in mind, right. Florida's tourism industry was responsible for welcoming",

So not not looking to not looking to deconstruct that in any significant way, but this is the thing to keep in mind, right. Florida's tourism industry was responsible for welcoming a record setting 143 million visitors and 24. So then if we look at 2023, it's 1.6 less than that. But in 2023, 11.5 million came from Canada and overseas markets. But it doesn't matter is effectively what that means. Based on this, it's exactly what I would expect. And the reason why I say this is it's something to keep in mind is because again, like I've seen a lot of the Canadians again, like they have nationalism. They feel proud of their country and they don't like the way that the US specifically Trump is treating them. And again, not weighing in on that one way or the other. I can totally see the perspective. But I do think it's skewing a bit of the analysis in terms of like their ability to quote unquote, like punch back. And they're trying to find, you know, they're really are focusing on buying local and that kind of stuff, which is great. That's really, really good for Canadians.

And this is just a microcosm of that, right? Even because this isn't just 11.5 from Canada, right? This is 11.5 million from Canada and overseas markets. So if we take a look from Canadian specific. So here Canadian specific visitation. So there are three point two million. Right. So there are two there less than two and a half percent of total visitors to Florida. So the flavor for that one, I think the impact is essentially no, just go open door for Thor. I don't think it matters much at all. And then the next from Flavia is also reduction in federal government spend on travel. A lot of my buddies who are still serving had their trips canceled puts on Hilton. Again, I think this is another really, really important thing to take a slightly closer look at. So let's do it. So what percentage of domestic US travel is from government related travel break it down by government agency or branch if pop. Then overlay the expected. Headcount reduction by each entity.

So we don't have numbers is what it says, but that in and of itself is actually slightly telling because if we don't know then the expected potential impact is probably going to be a little more muted. But we'll see. And then a DOD they're cutting 50 to 60,000 civilian jobs. So it's like a 5 to 8 reduction in workforce. So that I do think the civilians can travel a moderate amount if we take that. 5 to 8 reduction in total workforce 8 and maybe say 1 to 2 regularly travel. So I do think there's an impact from there, but probably not a ton. The VA is cutting 80,000, which does suck because the VA is already pretty strapped, but. I don't think the VA travels quite as much. I arrests I don't think the IRS travels that much and they're looking to cut them in half. So yeah, I mean, based on what I'm seeing here with the expected cuts to federal federal agencies, it doesn't really look like massive massive impact. So let's take a look really quick.

It's difficult to tell for domestic travel, but. Wow. Wow. Damn. Okay, what's the guess? What do you guys guess? What percentage is for business travel without looking it up? I'm actually very, very curious what you would guess. It's very different than what I was expecting. I will completely admit that up front. So what percentage of domestic US travel do you think is for business? Lave says 25. Any other guesses? 65, 68, 35, 20. Hey, I think Paulo, I think Paulo might have gotten it. It's about 20. So about 20 is for business and then 80 is for leisure. And that's from the US DOT. So then we can just guess right from those general numbers, right? So if there's 20 domestic travel that's based on business and then if we click into the areas that are going to be impacted by cuts. And then the subsequent impact that those cuts would take on the total impact of business level travel. It again probably isn't much. I would guess definitely less than 5 maybe two.

And a lot of places kind of fair pretty well given the broader reduction in visitation and movement. So I don't necessarily think it's the kind of thing where you're seeing leisure having to pay more to compensate for less business. I don't actually see that, but because the thing is, is you have to remember like let's use airlines, for example, airlines. And this is why it's always important to take the time and not get too vacuumed in into a specific level of inquiry. And I'll use this as an example, right? So for travels idea, which is a fair idea travels saying effectively if less business travel will prices go up for non business travel to compensate the companies for less business travel. But if you look at something like airlines, if that happens airlines, they don't care if somebody is traveling for business or for leisure, they care about how many people are on the plane.

So if they're noticing a total reduction in the number of the people on the plane, whether it's for business or travel, they're not going to inherently just raise the prices for other people because then you don't get the other people on the plane either. And then you have a plane that's flying with nobody in it. So what they do is they reconfigure the flight plans. They send less planes. So it's really, really important when thinking about and exploring these kinds of ideas, which again, I cannot encourage you to explore these kinds of thoughts more. This is exactly how you think about what's happening in the world and just come up with tradable ideas. So it's awesome. And it's really, really important that when you do it, you approach it with a really thrifty mindset because very rarely is it binary outcomes, right, if less business, then more expensive. And I'm not saying you said that. I'm just using that as an example. There's generally shades of gray and other scenarios that can pop up. So for example, if we think of hotels, the operating cost for a hotel, if a room is empty is not that crazy because the utilization of hotels typically is under utilized anyway, they obviously plan for a certain amount of vacancy. So then they can do all sorts",

So for example, if we think of hotels, the operating cost for a hotel, if a room is empty is not that crazy because the utilization of hotels typically is under utilized anyway, they obviously plan for a certain amount of vacancy. So then they can do all sorts of other little things to incentivize people to come in decreased the margins, but still use the room and stuff like that. So I think the broader the broader thought here is business already only takes up 20 of travel. If it was the other way around, then I would think very differently, but it's not. So because it's not and because businesses inherently a smaller portion of total travel, it would require a pretty significant change in total business travel in order to make a significant impact on things. So interesting thought exercise though. Events as so the underlying things that should have price affected, but since there is not a direct connection between less should mean price goes down. But that only works if bigger parties decide to move money. I'm still super struggle and man, I'm sorry. It sounds like you're essentially saying if like the bigger holders of something, the only reason why the stock would go down is if they sell. I think that's the which isn't fully accurate.

At least for me to be able to even give you a moderately useful response is if you give me like actual details because it yeah it's a little confusing. Example if Warren just bought Walmart yesterday. He doesn't care what comes out today or even within the next 10 years. Maybe I don't think it's fair to say that but maybe I think to your broader point, Warren likely wouldn't care about a lot of things. But I actually think it's a pretty significant error to say something definitive like he doesn't care what comes out today or in the next 10 years. I actually think that's a pretty big logical flaw to make. Simply because most of his holdings are longer term holdings that doesn't mean that Walmart couldn't come out with something that he would then say I actually should probably get out of this.

I mean, it's it's really not that's the thing it's relative when we as retail traders look at this and we think wow. 334 billion dollars. This is a lot of money. It's a ton of money as a gross number of dollars. But for something that has a market capitalization of 1.1 trillion that 334 billion that they're sitting on literally is less than 30 of the total market cap. So the and exactly so travel in travel is on the bigger thing that Buffett is talked about which in my opinion makes. Like a ton of sense with respect to why he's sitting on so much cash is because again, like if you look at this on a relative basis like this gives you the entire story right here. He has an 8.5 million dollar position in lilac and it's 0.0 of the portfolio. He needs to go out more decimal points to even see it register for an 8.5 million dollar investment. So then it starts to become really difficult to put anything on that's of even moderate size relative to the portfolio. That's why so many of his positions are",

    "text": "the portfolio. He needs to go out more decimal points to even see it register for an 8.5 million dollar investment. So then it starts to become really difficult to put anything on that's of even moderate size relative to the portfolio. That's why so many of his positions are a percent right again if you take a look to take a look at the some of the size of these trades. And they represent 1 of the portfolio a 2.8 billion dollar trade is 1. So the reason why the dude is so much cash is because he's got to find somewhere to use it and it's difficult and again I have a video coming out in the not so distant future that talks about some of the benefits you have as a retail trader but this is one of them. The fact that you are much smaller and much more agile is from a trading lens that actually is a benefit because it's much easier for us to move around in position which again I personally would take the problem of being this size and have to deal with you know the so difficult I would figure it out I think. But joking aside it does tell a story though from a trader's lens so. Cool got to set 1800 so I'm a wrap up I got a couple things I got to work on but as always if you need anything let me know being out there.",
