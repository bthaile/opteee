And one of the things that you'll notice is that again, the New York Stock Exchange is actually starting to show net highs. And if you take a look at the NASDAQ, it's still showing net lows. So the NASDAQ is still lagging here in a pretty broad manner. Now, gross lows for both, absolutely contracted. But NASDAQ is still showing net lows, even though it is experiencing some gross highs on top of it. So we are seeing a little bit of divergence. And what I mean by that is you can see the peaks on the net highs lows has slowly been coming in. Like following the tenants of following momentum apply, I don't know if people have talked about this. I mean, it's pretty self explanatory, but it's worth mentioning. The tenants of following momentum is about the same no matter what you're looking at. So if we're talking about following the momentum of price, we use a moving average and then we look at things like higher highs, higher lows, distribution of price. This same exact thing when you look at even something like this, the net highs lows diagram. You can take a look if there's higher highs, higher lows. And this is a good example where the lows are actually contracting. So we're not at the",

And this is a good example where the lows are actually contracting. So we're not at the point where we're posting anything that I would consider to be higher highs. But again, this rally, this rally as it's been unwinding, like most things we see in the market, it doesn't just like fall out of the sky. It really is something that you can kind of keep an eye on and have a sense of as it's underway. Now, we never know probabilistically, like I'll tell you right now, I didn't know that today was going to be a gap up. I had no idea. But based on this broader trend in this shorter term time frame that we're identifying, is this does start to show signs of at least general relative strength to this short period of time. You can see that in the net highs lows. You can see that even in something like the RSI that I use, the RSI with moving averages. So if you take a look here, you can see RSI passed above the MA starting this day. And then RSI has been, they've both been positive sloping with RSI remaining above. I'll make the MA a little bit darker so that it's easier to tell the difference. I don't really",

So you can see that the RSI has been riding above this. And again, it's not just this one day that it did. It's been above what the MA positive sloping. So my broader point here is just to continually remind you all a big part of what we do as traders is look at what's happening in the market. And we come up with probabilistic assumptions on what we think may or may not happen. That's not predictive. We don't know. But we can take guesses. And if we can wait those guesses slightly to have even a minor probabilistic edge, whether that's in terms of the frequency that we're correct or the size that we put on in those instances, then you can have something that you can make money off of. You can profit from it. So this is all to summarize that the move that we're in so far, that again, no way expected a gap. But this didn't just like happen overnight where it was an overnight gap.

A great example of that is actually the COVID bear market that definitely and I've been pretty vocal about that one. Because that one straight up did catch me by surprise. We take a look at the total market performance here. We'll see if anything sticks out to us. Tech comms both gapped up. There wasn't really anything else in here that I was like, oh, yeah, this caught my eye. The difference between discretionary and staples. Do you notice how discretionary actually had a pretty solid gap day here? Whereas staples continued to trend sideways. That is a decoupling of the normalization of this relationship in a really short term timeframe. It leads me to believe that the market is pretty significantly vying off of what happened this past weekend. But this goes back into what I think is continually worth noting that we are in a very emotional market. And I've said that enough now where I'm actually starting to think and I've talked about this on a couple of recent podcasts where I'm actually thinking that that's becoming just an increasing artifact of how things are now.

Just the standard volatility being higher because of things like high frequency trading systems because of things like algorithmic trading. I think all of those different factors can lead to the market experiencing larger moves than what we might typically expect to see. And again, my benchmark really goes back quite a ways. But the reason why this is important is because as fast as consumer discretionary is gapped up today and made this pretty strong move, I see no world where it could not just roll right back over. So because of that, the carry over to the portfolio is I think right now carrying a mix long short delta's beta weighted delta's to the SP 500. I think that that tends to be wise. So now let's take a look at just some of the market internals and see if there's anything that jumps out at us. Tesla has been absolutely insane. Tesla has been absolutely insane. We can see that I mean, I've been seeing this pop up on the overwhelming majority of the scanners that I run for anything that has trading activity or premium based activity.

And Tesla has been obviously sent down out of the stratosphere back down into the grass. And it definitely has started consolidating here, right? So we can see that it kind of approaches this bottom. And then we get a little bit of rally rolls back down towards the bottom and then you know, starts rallying back up and out. I still again, don't think Tesla is anywhere near out of the woods here. But if you recall, I don't remember what day the stream was again. I do a stream pretty much every day. So I don't always, I don't just remember when I said what, but it wasn't that long ago where I was talking about this exact idea and the pot odds that reflect around a potential trade in Tesla.

I liked this more so for the price because you can put on a very, very specific size trading here relative to account size. This isn't something I'm just trading in my own account. This is something I'm trading in a couple family member accounts. And don't worry, I don't tell them that I'm trading two times leverage. Tesla, right? That's I would be fired as an investment manager that Joe Kier obviously is, they don't pay me shit. So because they don't pay me shit and because there's no compensation in me for managing their accounts. I then take that as freelance to be able to be a complete derelict both in my portfolio and theirs so that we can all just lose money together. It's way more fun. So this actually fits pretty well for smaller portfolios for that exact reason. So the move here, I mean, is about as strong as you can get, right? Gapped up 23.5 today. So what I do for this is I trade longer term calls mixed with shorter term out of the money calls that can lead to a significant profit potential. So I'm actually going to probably prep a quick little video about this specific trade. I got to find that clip where I was",

So I'm actually going to probably prep a quick little video about this specific trade. I got to find that clip where I was talking about the current spot for the stock. But it came down to a monkey level analysis, which is this is pretty low. It hasn't gone lower. Tesla still is a viable company, not like this all this near term sentiment and the people trying to like trash the business and trashing people who have the cars, which is complete bullshit. By the way, that's ridiculous. But that stuff aside, that doesn't define the company and the company is still doing well. Just always been a wildly volatile company. You go back, like this movement is not new to Tesla. It's done this. It's entire life where it has these just crazy moves. So and a lot of this has to do with the industry, believe it or not, like the automotive industry, if you look across the past three years on most things in the automotive industry, it doesn't look good. So a lot of people take a look at Tesla and they're like, man, you know, Tesla is like really sucking here and like, they're kind of not. They're definitely way more volatile than names like this. But because of that volatility, there is a trade opportunity. So",

Pay, paid through the nose in terms of volatility. And this goes back to something I've talked to you about previously where depending on how you're choosing to trade, you always need to understand volatility. But how much you care about volatility will change depending on what you're trading and what your approach is. Because even if you pay through the nose and overpay massively on volatility, like I did, to get into TSLL calls. If you get a 20 move in a day, it doesn't really matter. The vol can contract as it did and the trade doesn't really care because of the delta change is so much greater. So it's something to pay attention to because traders notoriously as they're getting to like an intermediate level understanding of options, they'll start over optimizing for things that really don't necessarily matter as much as other things. But they think that they're doing something really smart by again, like the things like never buy vol if it's if volatility is expensive or implied volatility is above like 30. Right?

But those kinds of broad platitudes give you broad platitude performance, which is going to throw out the baby with the bath water all the time, which is exactly what would have happened here. So let's get into a couple of other things really quick. I want to run through some of the broad news from the day, anything that really stuck out to us here. So I haven't read this yet, but so stocks rallied on reports that said the upcoming reciprocal tariffs next week would be more targeted than previously stated in narrower than initially planned with some countries exempt and existing tariffs on steel and other metals, possibly not being cumulative. The market reaction to this kind of headline is insane. The reason why it's insane is because again, this is stuff we've already heard, but here's what's more important to me. What do you guys think? You guys tell me what do you think happens if some of the news such as steel and aluminum tariffs, because I was actually listening to CEO from some aluminum company. I forgot the name of it earlier talking about this. They're literally saying like, we don't know if the tariffs are going to be",

When do we know, right? The fact that that is in unknown right now to me is not good. That's not like a bullish thing. It's the kind of thing that I have a pretty sneaking suspicion. Again, I'm curious what you think. If it turns out something like these metal tariffs are unfavorably stacked on to one another or not, that could be a massive problem because right now they're trying to figure out, for example, if there's an existing hold on. Okay. It was just an alert from a stock screener, but it's just a recap for the day. I thought it was talking about the tariffs right now, but we good. If it turns out that they're going to add the tariffs on top of what already exists versus just have whatever the total number is, I think that the probability is the market will likely have some sort of reaction in either way.

So I skipped through a lot of the stuff that I don't really think impacts the markets, but I've listened to just about everything I found regarding Trump's discussions around tariffs. And the primary message I've heard from him across all of the pieces of content that I've listened to and just to give you some context with respect to Trump tariffs. And I would say near term tariffs in general, I'm probably close to 20 hours of dedicated research on that specific topic. And everything I've heard from Trump so far regarding the tariffs has not been wrapped around trying to drive revenue, but more wrapped around trying to even the playing field with places that, and again, I'm not arguing if the playing field is even uneven. I'm talking just from the lens he's been communicating to us. You can take it as whatever you want.

My hypothesis here is if we start getting unfavorable news in perceptions regarding some of these tariffs, I think the market is violently goes the other direction. That's my idea.

And then Trump indicated plans to impose a 25 tariff on a broader range of EU goods with specific TBD initial countermeasure from the EU. They announced retaliatory tariffs targeting 28 billion worth of US exports. The first phase initially set for one April includes a 50 tariff on US bourbon whiskey. Implementation day 20 March EU postponed the implementation of these tariffs to mid April, aiming to allow time for the negotiations and to avoid escalating the trade conflict. By mid April, the EU plans to impose tariffs on 18 euro, 18 billion euro worth of US goods and composing industrial products. Okay, so let's see, I want to see the existing stuff. Okay, so in 2018, it looks like there was a start with steel and aluminum. So that's been in place for a little while. Subsidies to Boeing and Airbus via WTO. That's interesting. That's from 2004 and that went to 21. Wow. That's crazy. So these guys have been, these guys have been at it for a while. These guys being the US, these guys have been US and EU.

These guys being the US, these guys have been US and EU. Jordan says, I feel like Trump has surrounded himself with solid people. I think Howard Lutnik will offer great advice on tariffs. Yeah, Howard Lutnik, I listened to some of his recent stuff and the only thing is, is I would love people in those and it is very difficult, but I really would love for people in those positions to just be more objective because I definitely got a lot of different leanings from him, but I do agree in general, like he's competent, like pretty much most of those people there, whether you like them or not, again, I think objectively they're competent. So I agree with that. Lauren says, I do believe he also wants more things produced in the US. That's a big thing, but so the production component of it is actually a little bit different than the upfront tariffs as well because the tariffs on different countries is one side of things that will still impact the trade with those different countries, but there's obviously a method for domestic companies to completely circumnavigate the tariffs by domestic production for some of them at least.

I don't agree with that, to be honest, I think again, I think it is completely reasonable to have different perspectives and preferences on things, but the reality is even in the prior administration, in the one before that, in the one before that, in zone and so forth, the people that are generally running the show making the decisions, they are smart people. They might be making decisions we don't like because it has some sort of impact somewhere else, and it's okay to not like the choice, but it is such a rookie mistake to downplay the intelligence into sum it up as just being silly. The Flavis says, market sentiment is shaping their policy, which doesn't really bode well for a coherent policy. Could you produce literally any evidence to that effect because I've not seen that? If they were creating policy based on market sentiment, there would not be tariffs. Right? That literally that entire announcement is what sent the market into a correction that's not market friendly. Tariffs are not market friendly, as you can see.

There are tariffs. See, this is one of the things that I encourage everybody to do. Do your absolute best to get news about what's happening from either market affiliated sources, or literally just bookmark Fox News and CNN. Because the reason is I can tell by a lot of these talking points, they're from a specific side of the news sourcing, and they miss, and again, you can listen to that side. I'm not arguing one is better than the other. They're both equally trash the fact that they're so biased. I'm not arguing that. But I'm saying as an objective analyzer, you have to get the information from both sides at this point because then the truth lies somewhere in the middle. But there are tariffs in place currently. And Flavis says they pause them based on the all on the dive in the market. What did they pause? What tariffs did they pause based on the dive in the market? Where do you get that?

It's an app called one second ground news. I don't know if you're familiar with ground news, but ground news is super, super cool because what it does is it aggregates news sources from different, I'll show you from different media.

If you guys have questions, anything else that you want to hit, throw it in the chat. Let's have a open conversation while we're doing that. I'm going to roll through and just run through some general scans and give you guys a couple updates. One of them is we are slated for the Wednesday session for skills development where we're going to be talking about exploring market themes just because I think it's wildly topical right now and analyzing macro events. This is a really fun topic because it requires absolutely precise balance. It's so easy to get sucked up into economic analysis because this stuff honestly is very interesting.

Scott says earnings tomorrow, GME earnings is tomorrow. And the market GME had a pretty big day today. I actually made quite a few adjustments. I made quite a few adjustments to a bunch of trades, but GameStop was one of them. So if we take a look at what GameStop is sitting at right now, again, these lines have been there for a little while, but you can see that it is starting to have the moving average is real line on a shorter term time frame. They're still completely inverted, but they're starting to orient in terms of slopes. The earnings is set for after the close, still quite a bit of volatility in here leading into earnings.

The Flavis says, what do you think about tourism, especially Florida? A large percentage of Florida tourism is from Canadian snowbirds. I could definitely see them reducing spend due to the escalating relationship with the US. That's a great question. I honestly don't know a lot about Florida tourism, but let's see what we can learn. So let's just postulate. Now, are you talked to me a little bit more broadly about the impact? What kind of are you thinking Florida-based tourism companies are like Disney? I don't know if Canadian visitors are big constituents of that. But okay, so analyze the Florida tourism industry across the state. Break down the percentage of non-US tourists. Then overlay with the percentage of US tourists. The interesting question. I think in general most of what I'm seeing, yeah, this is exactly what I expected. It's literally exactly what I expected.

They're not just upset at the trade policy, but they're kind of mad at Trump for the way that he's doing things. Which again, I don't blame them. Trump has been pretty inflammatory. So not looking to deconstruct that in any significant way. But this is the thing to keep in mind, right? Florida's tourism industry was responsible for welcoming a record setting 143 million visitors in 24. So then if we look at 2023, it's 1.6 less than that. But in 2023, a 11.5 million came from Canada and overseas markets. But it doesn't matter. It's effectively what that means. Based on this, it's exactly what I would expect. And the reason why I say this is it's something to keep in mind is because again, like I've seen a lot of the Canadians, again, like they have nationalism, they feel proud of their country. And they don't like the way that the US specifically Trump is treating them. And again, not weighing in on that one way or the other. I can totally see the perspective. But I do think it's",

But I do think a lot of the analysis that I see so far grossly over estimates, like the total potential impact that they will be able to have on the US in that way. And this is just a microcosm of that, right? Even because this isn't just 11.5 from Canada, right? This is 11.5 million from Canada and overseas markets. So if we take a look from Canadian specific, so here, Canadian specific visitation is 3.2 million, right? So they're less than 2.5 percent of total visitors to Florida. So the flavour for that one, I think the impact is essentially no, it's just got open door for Thor. I don't think it matters much at all.

What percentage of domestic US travel is from government related travel? Break it down by government agency or branch if pop. Then overlay the expected headcount reduction by each entity. Let's see. Because a couple things with respect to government level travel is it definitely is pervasive. It like it happens a lot. And I traveled quite a lot when I was in the Marine Corps for just different stuff. So it definitely is pervasive. But we have to see first objectively how pervasive it is. And then also we have to overlay that with the expected areas that are experiencing cuts. And what kind of impact we might be able to wager from that, so by the way, who's question is that again? That is the Flavah. By the way, the Flavah, specifically with your latest question on federal government spending, that is a really great line of thought.

And what I'm showing you is how to take a hypothetical idea like that and then to add some numbers around it so that we can try and identify again if there's a tradable opportunity here. So I actually really, really like the idea. So let's see. According to Bureau of Transportation Statistics, Americans undertake over 405 million long-distance business trips annually. While specific figures for government really travel are scarce, it's reasonable to infer that a portion of business travel includes trips by federal employees. Okay. So we don't have numbers is what it says. But that in and of itself is actually slightly telling because if we don't know, then the expected potential impact is probably going to be a little more muted, but we'll see. And then DOD, they're cutting 50 to 60,000 civilian jobs. So it's like a 5 to 8 reduction in workforce. So that I do think the civilians can travel a moderate amount if we take that 5 to 8 reduction in total workforce 8 and maybe say 1 to 2 regularly travel. So I do think there's an impact from there, but probably not a ton. The VA is cutting 80,000, which does suck because the VA is already pretty strapped. But I don't think the VA travels quite as much. IRS, I don't think the IRS travels",

But I don't think the VA travels quite as much. IRS, I don't think the IRS travels that much. And they're looking to cut them in half. So yeah, I mean, based on what I'm seeing here, what the expected cuts to federal agencies, it doesn't really look like massive, massive impact. So let's take a look really quick. What percentage of US travel is domestic? Is for business first personal. I want to see if it has even a general idea of that. It's difficult to tell for domestic travel, but wow. Wow. Damn. Okay, what's the guess? What do you guys guess? What percentage is for business travel without looking it up? I'm actually very, very curious what you would guess. It's very different than what I was expecting. I will completely admit that up front. So what percentage of domestic US travel do you think is for business? Yes. Lave says 25. Any other guesses? 65, 68, 35, 20. Hey, I think Paulo might have gotten it. It's about 20. So about 20 is for business. And then 80 is for leisure. And that's from the US DOT. So then we can just guess right from those general numbers, right? So if there's 20 domestic travel that's based on business, and then if we",

So if there's 20 domestic travel that's based on business, and then if we click into the areas that are going to be impacted by cuts, and then the subsequent impact that those cuts would take on the total impact of business level travel, it again probably isn't much. I would guess definitely less than 5 maybe two, maybe something like that, 2 total. Just a guess. I haven't done the math. It wouldn't be that hard to do, but the main thing is summarizing that down is probably not really that significant. So then going back to the original question of puts on Hilton, that's a different question in my opinion, but I don't think puts on Hilton outright due to the expectation of decreased federal travel and government travel in general. I don't think that makes sense, right? Based on just that rough amount of what we're looking at. Ben says the problem I see with these things is doesn't matter. It would only seem it matters if whoever controls interest in these things sells. I don't understand. When you say these things, what are you referring to?

Do they raise up or lower the compete? If there is less business travel, is that better or worse for travel for non-business? Like do they raise? That's hard to say, but again, I think the main thing is business travel already took a pretty massive hit during COVID, like the largest we've ever seen. And a lot of places kind of fared pretty well given the broader reduction in visitation and movement. So I don't necessarily think it's the kind of thing where you're seeing leisure, having to pay more to compensate for less business. I don't actually see that, but because the thing is, is you have to remember, like let's use airlines, for example. Airlines, and this is why it's always important to take the time and not get too vacuumed in into a specific level of inquiry. And I'll use this as an example, right?

But if you look at something like airlines, if that happens, airlines, they don't care if somebody is traveling for business or for leisure. They care about how many people are on the plane. So if they're noticing a total reduction in the number of the people on the plane, whether it's for business or travel, they're not going to inherently just raise the prices for other people because then you don't get the other people on the plane either. And then you have a plane that's flying with nobody in it. So what they do is they reconfigure the flight plans. They send less planes. So it's really, really important when thinking about and exploring these kinds of ideas, which again, I cannot encourage you to explore these kinds of thoughts more. This is exactly how you think about what's happening in the world and just come up with tradable ideas. So it's awesome. But it's really, really important that when you do it, you approach it with a really thrifty mindset because very rarely is it binary outcomes, right? If less business than more expensive.

I'm just using that as an example. There's generally shades of gray and other scenarios that can pop up. So for example, if we think of hotels, the operating cost for a hotel if a room is empty is not that crazy because the utilization of hotels typically is underutilized anyway, they obviously plan for a certain amount of vacancy. So then they can do all sorts of other little things to incentivize people to come in, decrease the margins, but still use the room and stuff like that. So I think the broader the broader thought here is business already only takes up 20 of travel. If it was the other way around, then I would think very differently, but it's not. So because it's not and because business is inherently a smaller portion of total travel, it would require a pretty significant change in total business travel in order to make a significant impact on things. So interesting thought exercise though. A Ben says so the underlying things that should have price affected, but since there is not a direct connection between less, should mean price goes down. But that only works if bigger parties decide to move money. I'm still super struggling, man. I'm sorry. It sounds like you're essentially saying if like the bigger holders of something, the",

Maybe I don't think it's fair to say that, but maybe I think to your broader point, Warren likely wouldn't care about a lot of things, but I actually think it's a pretty significant error to say something definitive like he doesn't care what comes out today or in the next 10 years.

    "text": "It's from CNBC Buffet Lodge. Now I'm just gonna, I'm literally just gonna flip through these on the chart. Right? Because if we're, if we're applying Ben's logic, then anything that Buffet bought in size shouldn't go down unless he sold. So let's see. So let's take a look at some recent things. BYD. So Buffet got into BYD back in 24. And and made June July. So he got in here. So after Buffet got in, it went up a lot and then it went down a lot. Buffet never sold. He still has his position. So this is an example where he got in. Stock price went up. Stock price then subsequently went down and it went down below his bases for a little bit. It's obviously been up since. But I'm just giving you an example on a way to kind of vet those kinds of thoughts. Right? Because there's more, more that goes into market price behavior than just if there's a large purchase from something. There's BISIDE and SELSIDE. Which is mostly what I see here. This is actually kind of interesting. Apple is still the biggest part of his portfolio. 300 million. AXP. It's almost like a mini-doubt Jones. They think about it. AXP, BAC, C-C-C-C-V-X. It really is like a mini-doubt Jones. If you take a look at his portfolio, the funny thing I always found about Buffet's portfolio is that it's really expanded in the total number of names that he has.",

If you take a look at his portfolio, the funny thing I always found about Buffet's portfolio is that it's really expanded in the total number of names that he has. But if you take a look, these hands down are the biggest holdings. As soon as you get out of the top, what five holdings, you immediately start looking at a slew of sub 5 positions that are tiny. Which is really interesting. What is his 23? 23. 43. 50. 65 ish in the top five holdings. Yeah. Jordan says his most interesting position is 334 billion in cash at the very bottom. I actually think people think it's way more interesting than it actually is. Because he's been, again, this is another one of the things that if you've listened to Buffet, he's talked about this exact thing. He makes it very clear as to why he's sitting on 300 billion of cash. And part of it, again, is if you look at it as a percentage of the total capitalization for Berkshire Hathaway, for those that need to revisit commas, hundreds, thousands, millions, billions, trillions. He's not sitting on a ton of cash relative to what he has. And a lot of people just see big numbers and they lose the context. Let's see what this is. 90. And then this is 334. Two. Let's see.

And a lot of people just see big numbers and they lose the context. Let's see what this is. 90. And then this is 334. Two. Let's see. My sheet is completely frozen. Kind of crazy to use numbers of this size. So how much cash do you guys think he's in? He's less than 30 cash. He's largely invested. Travel says 334 billions in cash is still significant. I mean, it's really not. That's the thing. It's relative. When we as retail traders look at this and we think, wow, 334 billion dollars, this is a lot of money. It's a ton of money as a gross number of dollars. But for something that has a market capitalization of 1.1 trillion, that 334 billion that they're sitting on literally is less than 30 of the total market cap. So, and exactly. So travel and travel is on the bigger thing that Buffett has talked about, which in my opinion makes a ton of sense with respect to why he's sitting on so much cash. He's because again, like if you look at this on a relative basis, like this gives you the entire story right here. He has an 8.5 million position in LILAC. And it's 0.0 of the portfolio. He needs to go out more decimal points to even see it register for an 8.5 million investment. So",

He needs to go out more decimal points to even see it register for an 8.5 million investment. So then it starts to become really difficult to put anything on. That's of even moderate size relative to the portfolio. That's why so many of his positions. Or a percent. Right. Again, if you take a look, take a look at the sum of the size of these trades. And they represent 1 of the portfolio. A 2.8 billion trade is 1. So the reason why the dude has so much cash is because he's got to find somewhere to use it. And it's difficult. And again, I have a video coming out in the not so distant future that talks about some of the benefits you have as a retail trader. But this is one of them. The fact that you are much smaller and much more agile is from a trading lens that actually is a benefit because it's much easier for us to move around in position. Which again, I personally would take the problem of being this size and have to deal with, you know, so difficult. I would figure it out, I think. But joking aside, it does tell a story, though, from a trader's lens. So yeah. Cool. I got to set 1,800. So",
