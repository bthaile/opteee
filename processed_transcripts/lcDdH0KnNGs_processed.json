We were just down somewhere where it was like 65 degrees and you go up this super steep incline and then at the top, you're literally in a spot that's completely frozen. It's all snow and it looks like Tatooine. I think that's the ice world. Poth? Poth. That's the right one. Sorry. My bad. I don't hold that against me. But yeah, I think absolutely stunning, stunning place. Okay. So let's talk about the markets super fast. I'm going to spend very little time on this and then we will move on. I just want to highlight a couple things that are sticking out to me. I never know if this stuff is useful for you, but this is useful to me. This is the stuff that I look at and it helps paint the picture. For example, the gold trade yesterday, when we were on the live stream, I already had talked about building a gold trade than somebody mentioned like, oh, gold's moving a little bit more. So then I popped over and looked and it was so that I ended up putting on more of a trade. Somebody might see that and be",

So then I popped over and looked and it was so that I ended up putting on more of a trade. Somebody might see that and be like, oh, that was a rash movement, right? Just kind of run through something super fast and not really having a solid game plan in place, just running into something, which is the exact opposite of what that is. If you think about the skill set in the art of trading, the process of transactions, meaning placing trades that that element is minuscule in terms of the overall skill set of trading, which is analyzing broad swaths of imperfect moving data and building and understanding of different things to do. And the way that I was able to make that gold trade last night in a flash is as soon as somebody told me it was moving and after looking at it, we can go back to the stream. I don't remember how long it took me to look at it, but it was definitely less than 30 seconds that it decided I wanted to put a trade on it. So that 30 second decision is preempted by all this other background research that makes it a 30 second decision because what happens to a lot of other people that don't do that, it turns into a 10 minute decision",

So that 30 second decision is preempted by all this other background research that makes it a 30 second decision because what happens to a lot of other people that don't do that, it turns into a 10 minute decision or a fucking three day decision where we can't make a choice or makes no decision if we're completely locked up. So getting trained to look at the information that's important to then use that to feed trade decisions and then to be able to make a reasonably good decision in a timely manner is important. And trading is unforgiving in that timely manner aspect because sometimes people can falsely feel like they're rushed and that's dangerous. You don't want to feel rushed. Rush is bad, but you also don't want to wait too long because if you wait too long, then you get stuck in analysis paralysis and you don't really get too far. That's really what ends up happening here. So let's take a look at Broad Market overview. We still have spy hanging near all time highs. We have a really big by date today and it's hanging inside the prior days range. So I keep an eye on that in terms of overall volatility is contracting. Movement is slowing down a little bit.

I still have a small Russell position on now that looks okay, but I paired down a good bit of it yesterday and the day before just because it did look like we're starting to stall. So percentage of stocks in the SP 500 above the 50 day moving average is 75, 76. So this is hanging in there. So this movement is broadly supported. Again, even before I go over to the view that I have that looks at all the indices, I will already know that based on what I see here. It's generally being more broadly supported. Chop, chop, this says only put first and third because we've put second. That's the point, man. That's exactly how that shit starts. So somebody decided to put first at one point at one time and then everybody else just started playing the game. So now you know why people try to write first because somebody started it and you fell right in line with them in playing the game. So let's go to sectors. Let's see.

So it's hard to tell where weakness starts to creep in and what it's going to look like. We don't really have a sense of that obviously. But what I do see here is general strength across most of the market and it is generally being supported by pretty good earnings. So earning season so far is not really showing up a bunch of bad stuff. This past week was very, very lucrative from an earnings trading perspective because things are doing well but it's a more in line with expectations kind of series of earnings moves as compared to some of what we saw not too long ago a couple quarters a few quarters ago now where earnings were all over the fucking map.

So this is what's currently on in TQs. I am up to 200 shares at a basis of 7326. So total cost there is about 14 and a half grand. And this is yeah, this looks okay. I'm just checking the formulas as they're getting copied over. Yep, that's good too. So 200 shares short one put at the moment and then short one call at the moment. So this is this is how this strategy is really designed to go. It's really not super busy not doing a lot with it. I added a little bit today just because I want to get slightly more exposure into TQs with where the market is. But I don't want to be overexposed because this still is quite tenuous in my opinion.

All moving averages are ascending. Let me change the study set on this really fast. This is too small. That's good. So right now we have Qs not quite at all time highs again. It's not too far off though. And I'm seeing a couple things that make me slightly concerned but not overly where we're seeing these really big red days that are being supported by the 10 day moving average on a short term time frame. So this just looks like a ugly ascent. Like that's what I feel here. Now this looks like it's starting to set up for a little bit of a sideways trend could be for a little bit. Obviously we will have to see how it plays out. But that's the general gist of where Qs is. So that's why I didn't want to be under invested up here in case it does start another leg up. But I don't want to be over invested in case it starts another leg down. So that's exactly why right now I'm 42 utilized. But of that 42 we",

So that's exactly why right now I'm 42 utilized. But of that 42 we have a decent chunk of that that's wrapped up in these short puts that would be managed because with something like this depending on what the market looks like that will all determine how aggressively I'm going to be worrying about trying to roll these puts and the calls if I'm getting challenged to the upside. So there's just not a whole lot going on here yet. The trades work and find it's 3.72 return on invested capital. I've been in the trade for three days. So I'm sure this will look like an absolute mess in the not so distant future. The beginning part of this trade is always the easiest because T triple Qs will it will like it literally will without a doubt look really ugly at some point in the not so distant future because it always does. And that's because if you're not prepared to experience three times volatility in something like this three times volatility is not the right choice. But if you are and you're ready then it's really not that big a deal. It'll be completely navigable. So that's the TQ okay. So next up we now have our quiz. So let's",

I can I'm just going to have to paste it in in two spots. So there's the first question. Let me give you the other two. The other two there maybe I'll just put it on here so that you guys can all see it in the same spot. That's probably smarter isn't it instead of the chat. Here's your first question. And then I'll move it in a little bit. I'll read it out as well. So the first question here is what is implied volatility in options trading now to be clear. All I did is I went into perplexity and I said give me options quiz with 10 questions. So I haven't looked at any of these yet myself. I'm literally going to be taking the quiz with you. The other thing though is the first set of questions that it gave me were way too easy. It was like terribly, terribly easy. I still got pissed off at it because I thought these were way too easy.

Not to, to be honest, nobody should feel good about themselves if you got that right because that is unbelievably easy.

We have premium received plus difference between strike and stock. Chromium received minus stock purchase strike price minus stock purchase price. Rich C says I'm late trying to catch up. I'll figure out what people saying B. People are saying B because we're taking a quiz homey. So they're giving the answer based on what we see. Okay, so I'm seeing Bs across the board again. Yep.

So the point here, the price of a call option is always equal to the price of a put option. Well, if we look at the strike price for anything, we will actually see the call and the put are typically different. So that's how this is disproven. It's not by me just saying the words it's false, but I'm giving you an example on how it's false from a logical perspective. So that's good. This one's false. Did anybody guess B? Nobody guess. Okay, Elon songs guess B. So Elon songs explain to me why you think it's B. You're the lone soldier, a lone and unaffraid here. Why do you think it's B?

So going to see put call principle, be or put call parity being the difference between American European options, did we have anybody answer that? Rested and I'd rather be skiing. So either Reese or I'd rather be skiing. Why do you think it is C? And then for one of the many that put D, why is it not C? Okay. I'd rather be skiing says I guess that's a fair answer. But why did you guess that one versus guessing a, b or d, which are all other viable guesses? So there was something about this one that led you to guess this one. So what was the logic behind the guess? You guys already know, you're not going to get off easy here with, oh, I just took a swag. Swags are cool, but a swag is still based on something and we need to understand the something. Jotato says see like that doesn't even seem like a principle. That's just information.

American options have div risk early exercise, which breaks put call parity. Shrey J, he's just sunned everybody. So Trey J gets plus one fake internet point.

My bad, Trey J, I tried to tag you my keyboards off. Give me a break here. There it is. So this is the Shrey J is 100 correct. So put call parity principle applies to the relationship. And the reason why the relationship between put and call options is so important is because it opens the door for arbitrage if put call parity is broken. So it's a really important theory from a theoretical perspective, but then also from kind of like an institutional trading perspective. The way that most retail traders understand put call parity writ large is that markets are efficient. That essentially means that there's not a slew of arbitrage opportunities due to mispricing the relationship between puts and calls. Now put call parity primarily applies to European options, but it also exists for American. There's just a different rules set that is applied that has to take into account those other factors that Shrey J outlined. Okay, so that's another stupid easy question. Let's do, I think there's one more easy question. This is a terrible question. All right, here's the next one. The next question is what is a vertical spread in options trading?

So this is same expiration, same strike. If I buy a call and then buy a put and take a look at what this looks like, I got to get rid of all this other nonsense. So this is a long startle if you take Joe's options terminology. For most other people, we would call",

And really, it's just the inverse obviously of a straddle. So when you're doing same expiration, same strike, really if you're doing anything in that configuration, it's going to be a straddle whether it's longer short. Now you can have like ratios so you can have one side with you can have more calls than puts, something like that. But yeah, so we have the long startle here. The next thing we have, Sedrick, walk me through how I would place a vertical spread. Sedrick. Obviously, the reason why I'm asking you is just I want to make sure that you feel confident in how to how to build it. And then if you have any questions on, I want to make sure that you're good. So we're in the 15 know of expiration 28 DT. You can we can go either call or put side either of those are completely okay.

If not, I'll give him another second then I'll walk through it. So let's. Sedrick says I don't trade options but choosing choose strikes to play. That's okay. Yeah. So Sedrick, that's totally cool. So when we're looking at a vertical spread, it's essentially a way to trade the either a long or short option. It has what I call the base leg and then it has a wing. That's how I think about them. So for example, if I wanted to buy a put, I can come in here and buy this 75 put. Now if I have a smaller account, that can be expensive and I might not want to just buy this 75 put because it takes a lot of money. So then I can do something else like cell, a corresponding option and I can create a vertical spread.

Again, joking aside, how difficult are these questions for you? Because I'm joking about it, but some of these, I definitely think put call parity was more tricky for people. And that doesn't surprise me because from a retail trading perspective, put call parity, it really doesn't matter that much. It just genuinely doesn't impact the overall approach significantly.

We'll stretch us as it's a like I said. Is everybody uniform on A or do you want to see an example? Do we think it's A? Chop says looks like A to me. It's C or B. These interesting. Let's continue and see if we can gain consensus. So the next part of this. is gonna click that. I don't remember which one I'm supposed to click. This might get rid of, I'm not gonna risk it. Let's see. So we have a short strike here at 50. We have a short strike here at 40. When we're answering the question, do we apply one credit to each side, or do we combine the two credits? Because that's what you collect in total. That's the first clarifying question here. Combine, yep, it's good. So now we have a net credit, read dollars. So when we're looking at the break even, which part of this do we care about for the break even? Does the break even deal with the wings at all? How far we can go in the money on the shorts? That's exactly correct. So it pertains to the shorts. So if we have a, I still have room here. So if we have a short call at 50, and then we have a short put at",

So if I sell a put here at this point, and then I buy to open a put here at this point, and I'm using this time series here for us, the break even for a sold to open put. This case, it would be put vertical. The break even you get a buffer from the credit you receive. In this case, a 3 buffer. Your strike in this case is 40. Less the 3 credit. 37. That's your break even point. Because you get a buffer from that total credit of 3. So that's why it's not 43. 43. Say, for example, let me hide this. Move this. And get back to this. So say, for example, we have this 40 short put. 35 long put. If we have 43, if the stock is at 43, that's not your break even. That's your max profit. Anything above 40.

Short put is at 70. The long put is at 65 and I'm getting a 1.15 credit. So walk me through where you think the break even is on this example. And the reason I'm using this example is because I'm getting rid of the call side. It doesn't matter other than what you collect for the credit. We can add that if we want, but I want to isolate the put side. Because what I think you're doing is not adjusting your break even based on the option type. That's what I'm thinking. But I'm trying to troubleshoot that now. So chop, what's my break even going to be? Again, short the 70 long the 65 all on the put side. I'm getting a 1.15 credit in this example. So what's my break even going to be? And then the cliff notes version for everybody else is if you collect a larger net credit from an iron condor. For example, you can't lose on both sides at once. Well, I mean, the market could probably find a way to do that to me, but typically you can't. Chop says 1.15 between the first strike. Between the first strike and what? Between the first strike and spot price? From the first strike. Okay.",

Between the first strike and what? Between the first strike and spot price? From the first strike. Okay. So you're saying that the break even is going to be 7.15. Yeah. Is that correct? Sedric coming off the top rope at 66 15. That's not correct. Sedric, by the way. Good guess, though. But for choppers. Oh, fuck, that's a tough name. New Jean Kangaroo. I like that name. New Jean says 68, 68 85 break even is correct. That will be the break even. But I want to see specifically if chop. This fall on a long because the way I'm reading chops prompt there. For 1.15 from the first strike, that to me would lead me to believe. 1.15 below the strike. You sold OK, perfect. Yeah, yeah. OK, great. You so you have it. That's exactly correct. So in this case, your break even right here is at 68.85 if I could get there perfectly. It's right there. So it's exactly correct. That's good. So then perfect.

Oh, no, this is perplexity. I want to give chat GPT bad fade. This one. I'm going to merge this so that it's in one spot. It says in a butterfly spread using call options, what is the maximum profit if the stock price at expiration is exactly at the middle strike price? The difference between the high and low, the difference between the middle and low strikes price strike prices minus the net premium paid. The premium received or unlimited. The only issue I don't like with this question is that it's not, it's not clarifying if this is a long or short butterfly, which I don't like. I see B. I believe you can be whatever you want to be.

It's, it's not differentiating. Technically, you can still answer the question without that. But just by inferring what it's saying, but yeah. Elon Song says, what is the use case in small accounts? It's kind of a way like you can trade, for example, like an iron butterfly. That's something I would use pretty regularly. So let's say that we're trading something like SPX, great example. Good pick, Elon Songs. And let's say that we want to sell a straddle. And right now I'm in the pass through IRA account. So if I wanted to sell a straddle in here, I need 685,000.

And specifically, it'll be people like me that are in content creation, because if you're not into creating content for whatever reason, then there's essentially no incentive here to like go through and because you're not going to learn a lot from here. So, let's see, let's see what kind of stuff they have. Oh, let's read this one. So, this one says, so I've tried a lot of different trading strategies from butterflies, condors, debit spreads, put spreads, had some success, but not life changing to the point I can make more than I withdraw. I recently have tried a version of a poor man's covered call, but not traditional that has made money. This setup is one long call, about three months in the spy around 50, then I sell a call and roll up call options, gaining a credit. The",

This setup is one long call, about three months in the spy around 50, then I sell a call and roll up call options, gaining a credit. The stock rise is, I keep rolling for credit. If the stock goes down, I roll and collect a credit and profit. So, what do you guys think? If you were to respond to this, what would your response be? My thoughts as I read this is, it's just a diagonal. Patrick says it seems risky. Sort of. I mean, it's really not any risky, any more risky than holding shares. This is kind of close to what I actually try to do with diagonals. It's a little bit messed up because this is going further out of the money, which I, again, they're making the mistake. What will first answer me this? What mistake are they making here? And we'll literally, I mean, while we're doing this, we'll fucking draft a response to them, because we're already fucking, we're already in here. Might as well share it with them. So here I would say a couple, oops, a couple thoughts. You don't need to use a strike above spot for the long. If you don't want to, the benefit of doing this, the benefit of getting a further out of the money strike is it will be cheaper. However, because",

Three months or more. Out in time, it won't have significant gamma relative to a near term. Additionally, it will be all extrinsic value. Next one here is selling the call, depending on where you sell it relative to the long, is likely to sacrifice upside potential, which is the larger driver of profit in this structure. Here, the credits are just in salary, profit mechanism. My approach to trading these is called a ratio diagonal. I prefer using greater than 50 delta long options to increase dollar for dollar move. Downside is they're more expensive and decrease value. Correct. I also don't like selling one to one short calls against longs and prefer at least three to one longs to shorts to preserve upside. So what do you guys think? Does this make sense relative to what they're doing? Because the problem is, is like their game of rolling the calls and stuff, that's fine. It's not going to break anything. But they're not going to make a lot of money doing that. They're going to be spending all the time rolling these calls, collecting pennies on the dollar.

Reese says three months isn't even that long. Three months is plenty long. I call it a 90 day diagonal. So this case called a ratio diagonal. Yeah, because 90 days is fine with a one month hold. If I'm trading a 90 day ratio diagonal, I plan to manage the trade within six weeks more often four weeks to limit theta decay, ramping up within 60 dt. So there's a response for them. Nice job team. Next, see if we have anything else. Compounding is a way to retirement. Let's see what they have to say. I never buy long options on anything with an upward trend, especially it consists in all time highs, playing with fire when it comes to spy. I couldn't disagree more with you, Rich. I actually think that some of the best possible times you can literally buy option. The it sounds like you probably have a little bit of like option bargain buying tendencies. That's what what I pick up there. And it's super common. People have that that natural disposition all the time. Also, give me one second. I got to pop up in",

I'd rather be saying the wheel option strategy. I think that's what I thought it was called. Which one? Because what we were just looking at was a diagonal. Very different than the wheel. But yeah, so like a good example of buying stuff near highs is like the trade that I did yesterday in in gold. I literally bought it when it was at all time highs. Right. I literally bought it at the very, very tippy top that it can go. And I've made good money on it so far. So the thing is people have a natural tendency to try to bargain by to look for deals, to look for things that are cheap. And when things are cheap, they're typically cheap for a reason. So I'm not saying it's always smart to buy things when they're at highs. It's completely, it's completely relative to the opportunity. Rich says, for example, what's your opinion on rumble?

Yeah, this is 100 would not go long. To me, this looks like something that had a really great pop. And then it's had declining earnings. Which I don't love. And earnings for it are 11. No. It looks like most people are playing earnings to the upside. So I would expect. I would expect them to at least based on the positioning here, it does look like people are expecting it to run up. But we can take a look if there's actually anything that I would consider to be an informed trade in there. Let's see. Rich says declining because they didn't have subscription active. It doesn't matter. Like that's one of the things to remember as a trader is, I actually think it's super important to completely detach from that stuff.

So the volume that I see in here is nothing that I would consider to be educated. I see a little bit here, but this is already gone. So yeah, when I see this kind of skew, it's important for me to see it because it's interesting. But then when I look at the kind of size trades that are going on to kind of gauge overall conviction and informativeness of the order, that's not a lot of it. Now, I want to be clear, all of this doesn't mean from can't go up. It absolutely can't. Right? Like there's no rules.

    "text": "about to say. It's not about can this trade work? I can always argue to myself why a trade could work. What matters to me is, is this the right place for my money? That's what I care about. So does that mean that rum can't go up even though it doesn't look attractive to me? Of course it can. It absolutely can. But I'm not worried about any one individual trade working. That's not my focus as a trader. You pivot from being kind of an amateur to at least intermediate, more professional level when you start devaluing the outcome of individual trades and you worry so much more about the system. How does the system perform in the aggregate long term if I continue to apply a general rule set to it? So for example, I'd rather be saying says best to follow the trend. Maybe I'm not even arguing that myself at all because there are people that trade contrarian strategies really, really well. But definitely what I have found and it's based on not just what I've seen anecdotally, but based in research is things that are at highs tend to continue making highs. So for example, this scan is looking for optionable products, well, equities that have made at least a 100 move sometime within the last three months. And if I click through these, take a look. This is made a massive move. Absolutely massive move. I don't know what this is. Let me",

Then here it didn't didn't didn't did here did here. Didn't you get the point? This thing traded at 52 week highs for consecutive periods of time. Now again, does that mean that this is going to continue going up into perpetuity? No, of course not. There is a chance that this will slow down, stop reverse, just like it did here. And then depending on the quality of that reversal, it could just be a consolidation phase before resumption of a trend or it could be an episodic pivot where something is now returning back to a base value after being snapped out too far.

So when you show me rum, if I look at trying to trade this, I would trade it from a market neutral perspective, because it has really high IV, and I see it has really strong variance for its premiums. So I would play this from a market neutral perspective by like selling a strangle or something. Now me personally, I wouldn't do it just because it's super cheap. So in order for me to gain something that would be even worth putting the trade on would be very difficult. It would just, yeah, this would be kind of ridiculous. So, but for a smaller account, this can look completely fine for like a variance risk premium style play. The issue here is that things with high volatility, they have high volatility for a reason. So that means it's likely to move. Now in this case, it still has really high risk premiums. So it looks interesting, but this is not something I'm inclined to go long. Because if I look at it across a six month time frame, it's declining. If I look at it on a three month time frame, it's declining. How's it doing on a 30 day? Slightly upward sloping now given these days. So that's good. Moving averages are all over the place. It's not even",

And this is a little bit too much of the consolidation. If you get something that has this kind of pop, but then it pulls back like 5 or so, that's still showing strength and acceptance of like a new value. This looks like a little bit too much of a return to prior value. So I don't love it from that perspective. So yeah, this for me would be unattractive for a long trade with respect to earnings could play it for earnings from neutral perspective. But I would have to do a little bit more homework on its prior earnings to see if I would do that. Let's take a look at earnings. Looks good there there. Looks good here, here, here. Yeah, I would trade this for earnings. This looks good across the board from earnings. It's had some type moves, but most of them have still worked out okay. So I would trade this for earnings via short premium though. That's essentially it. So yeah, overall interesting, but it's also a good example of the process of trying to stack",

They were five cents wide on the primary expiration. So like that's completely reasonable, five cents wide. If you're looking to put on you know, 100,000 position, then yeah, that's not it.

Do you remember? Let me see if I can find the link to the video. I think it was a livestream that we did APP. This one. From the 10th. A key. And APP came on in an hour and 20. And I want to see. Oh, that's loud. I gotta turn that down. So I think APP what time did I say it started? 102. So let's take a look at you can watch this whole video here. But this trade I literally walk through everything that happened with APP. So here, let's listen to a little bit of it on. We'll go fast though. We'll do what? Like one and a half time speed.

I don't know how that works. We're about to find out though. I think not. Thanks. The average daily range was wide. That is how I find stuff that's moving more. Right. I'm finding things that are accelerating intraday. The second thing is it popped up because of this move here into consolidation period. While this is running, I'm actually going to grab another seltzer water. But what I'm walking you through right now is the setup that I saw at the point in time. So this is an on demand talking about how I found the stock originally and walking through the setup as it developed. So I will be our period. So this is going to be for me. I'm targeting the breakout. That's what I'm starting to scope here. So now from here, because essentially we ran from 60 to 90 to massive move in a relatively short term time frame, especially for something like that didn't fall quite as heavily as the SP 500. It went from 87 to 60. So big, big, big giant move about started consolidating and you can see where I set my entrance for. I'm very interested if I can see ideally a close above this level.

I'm very interested if I can see ideally a close above this level. Any questions so far on what I saw and how I saw it? Pretty simple. There's nothing, nothing crazy about this. It's literally just looking at something that had a big move and started consolidating. A policy says some options have extremely high volatility, but low liquidity. Do you ever trade those? I avoid low liquidity. Low liquidity will kill you. It takes any like for your example. And also I don't really care if something just has high volatility. High volatility itself will not man or an orange. It doesn't draw me. It doesn't make me leave. It's just an input. But liquidity has to be there. The reason is you can essentially just the reason the primary reason is because most people think about what it's going to be like getting into a trade and they don't focus enough on what is like getting out of the trade. So there's a really good function for making sure that there's liquidity and what you're looking at. So sometimes I'll trade less liquid stuff for sure, but I'm not going to trade those at size and I'm not going to trade something I'm expecting to have to touch a lot because again, low liquidity will get up.

It's kind of the beautiful part because maybe you're like me and not good with directions set here at 92 94. That's here where you can see at the bottom left there with volume right out of the jump is that if I so now what I'm doing is I'm showing the actual day that I entered because this is actually kind of a really cool case study that's still going. It's not I'm not out of the trade yet. That's why I wanted to bring it up. And I think it's fun to be able to show you something that started. I don't remember exactly when I got into this. That's been going though for quite a while now. I take a look at the total volume that traded 2.3 million shares at two hours into the open.

So what's the next thing that you can tell me about the volume that I noticed because that is another super important factor when I look at this because when I'm looking for breakouts and things that look like they're going to be breakouts. I look for stuff that is super heavy volume that shows lots of people buying. So the probability even though the day's not done yet, the probability of this ending with volume right down here where you can see in the bottom left there with volume that exceeds the averages is exceedingly high because it's already almost pacing them two hours into the day. So this ended up popping up on my alert because of two reasons. But the main reason wasn't actually volume. It was just entry day move of 5. So I have a scan that sends me stuff that have options and are moving greater than 5. So this was already on a watch list and essentially just looking. Now I had an alert set here at 92.94.

And I ended up scaling out most of the trade between these two days and then I accident on this day. So this is an example of not failed yet. But this is just a wider consolidation.

So two different versions of essentially things that popped up from this very same scan. I don't know why this thing is struggling hardcore to pull up these. Let's see if we get anything here. I don't know what the problem is. It's done this before though. Let me try a loser consolidation period. And then if this doesn't work, I'm going to try making another scan for this. Yeah, this is like completely locked up. So I'm asking for complexity to write me a thing script. I'm going to try running a new one really quick. Using open and closed prices default is eight. Let's see. Let's see what that does. Reese says if you're looking at short at a short and the underlying has callsque, does that impact your decision? It depends entirely. Does it impact the decision short? Does it make or break the decision not so much for me? So I would need to know more context. It is a data point that I would care about. But I'm going to try this variation of the scan. See if this gets through. Yeah. Man, this thing is like really stuck. I hate when it does this. Whatever.

Yeah, let's take a look at GME. We're going to, we have the live, the GME live stream tomorrow. So obviously we will dive deep into some game stop tomorrow. But looking at it today, it's very, very quiet. That's what I've been overall sensing. Like if we take a look at the average daily ranges, those have come down massively. So the average true range from a 90 day perspective is 6.97 and then on a five day time frame now is 3.5. So this is just coming down heavily. The volume has been generally siphoned out. It did have a small pop and volume. But I mean, that's why I haven't had a game stop update video in a little bit just because they're just genuinely from a trading perspective isn't a ton going on. So yeah, to me right now, it looks very quiet. What the next catalyst is, I don't know. We did get the news about the PSA grading thing, which I think is good. But yeah, the I'd rather be skiing says it does tend to do that before a sudden pop. The tricky part is it can do it for a really long time. Right.

So if we go back 10 years and we look at 2014 running all the way through up until 2021, it was super quiet. And then after the move that we saw in 21, it gently moved down. These are monthly level canals, by the way. And then essentially from, you know, 20 mid late 2023 into 2024, it really didn't do much except decline, like five points or something like that. And then obviously it had its recent run. And now it looks like it's starting to consolidate again. The cool part about this consolidation, I can say is that it's at a much higher level, right? So that part tends to bode well in my opinion. But yeah, overall, overall pretty quiet. I agree. Let me see if there's another consolidation scan I can run. So this is looking at five days. Yeah, no dice man broken, broken broken. All right, gang, well that wraps me up. I'm going to tinker with this thingscript for a while. You guys are welcome to hang out.

Because for me, hope is literally a terrible trading strategy. Hope is terrible because it's like it's not the way that I have approached creating wealth. That's for sure. And I wouldn't be where I'm at today if I had gone off of hope personally. I think it's okay to take speculative trades and to take risks and to take things that are lower probability about high payout. But that needs to be complemented with a suite of higher opportunity trades in terms of expected return at least. So that's my two cents at least. So yeah, I think the I hope you do get lucky with it, Rich. I really do hope that it does pan out that way for you. I also have to be honest, if that was my approach, I would just buy shares so that I'm not losing money on options. Because I know that you're saying that you're doing it for a profit. I'm sure they're not all for a profit because I can find periods where Monday was less than Friday. Right? So that",

And it looks like it's starting to set higher lows. We'll see how it behaves here. Volatility is very high. And it has earnings coming up. So six know. So yeah. Rich says you're looking at the day. It's generally less 30 minutes and few hours. Monday it's brief. Yeah, I can still see it though, right? Based on high lows, it's not going to escape the rest of the chart. I'm not making the assumption off of where it's at the close or something like that. So yeah. Patrick says I usually buy leaps on GME. So you, so you, my money is just sitting there for now.

Like for people that are trying to play a longer term thesis on something like GameStop, I think that's genuinely okay. The downside to that is there's a few problems with it. At least from, I think the perspective that a lot of people try to trade GameStop in, one of them is if you do get the move that you're hoping for, you're not going to be able to get out at a good price. And that's going to be one of the largest drawbacks to those long term options with something like GameStop. If it does have one of these parabolic moves, whether it's driven from a short squeeze, Gamma Squeeze, whatever, Algos, start and go crazy, all that stuff will massively move price. So you're going to take a massive haircut on where you're getting out, which again, could be part of the overall approach, overcoming it via leverage could be okay. But that's one of the main issues I see with it. From a longer term perspective, I think it's completely okay. Like if you are really convicted in something for some reason, funny enough, I was talking with my buddy Giggles earlier today about some of his holdings.
