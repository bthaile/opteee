    "text": "I hate videos like this it's because I'm going to be punching holes in one of the most common option strategies for new and small Traders this can disenfranchise people from Trading which is not my objective however above all my commitment to you all is investing without the so contrary to all the YouTube searches that you'll find if you throw in this strategy you're going to see tons of people talking about free money monthly income make a lot of money on a little money it's all that kind of nonsense and it's just not how this works what strategy we talking about today it's going to be vertical credit spreads this can be vertical spreads in general but I'm specifically talking about vertical credit spreads here and I'm going to walk us through five things quick recap on what they are the structure itself Pros cons then I'm going to talk about the big problems specifically and at the end of the video the fifth thing is I want to give you some Alternatives I'm not just going to leave you high and dry talk about all the problems with this and then leave you nothing to go off of but there's probably a lot of stuff in here people don't really understand when they're trading something like this and that's my hope to share information with you all so that you can make informed decisions so we're going to see whether or not you can handle",

    "text": "of efficiency now let's talk about some of the primary issues before we get into the big one this is a low gross returning strategy in this case for a dollar wide vertical you're making 23 that's not that much money it also has more friction because there are multiple legs if you think about your commissions let's say you pay 65 cents per leg that means on the way in you are paying a130 for those that don't realize how massive that is on a 23 potential return that's 5.7 of your max profit gone just on the entry that doesn't include the exit and this also doesn't include the slippage that you are inevitably going to pay because of the spread so they're very expensive for what they are they also have a contradictory thesis in my opinion or they're just inefficient in their expression so what I mean by that is sometimes you'll hear oh if IV is high then you sell credit spreads well aren't you buying the exact thing you are saying is too expensive it kind of doesn't make sense and more important than that they're not the most efficient way to capture these different kinds of Expressions so we'll talk a little bit about that later and the other thing you are risking relatively a much larger sum of money to make a much smaller amount of money this is exactly why they tend to be high probability strategies so that leads us",
