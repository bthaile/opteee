    "text": "I hate videos like this because I'm going to be punching holes in one of the most common option strategies for new and small traders. This can disenfranchise people from trading, which is not my objective. However, above all, my commitment to you all is investing without the bullshit. So contrary to all the YouTube searches that you'll find, if you throw in this strategy, you're going to see tons of people talking about free money, monthly income, make a lot of money on a little money. It's all that kind of nonsense. And it's just not how this works. What strategy are we talking about today? It's going to be vertical credit spreads. This can be vertical spreads in general, but I'm specifically talking about vertical credit spreads here. And I'm going to walk us through five things. Quick recap on what they are, the structure itself, pros, cons, then I'm going to talk about the big problem specifically. And at the end of the video, the fifth thing is I want to give you some alternatives. I'm not just going to leave you high and dry, talk about all the problems with this, and then leave you nothing to go off of. But there's probably a lot of stuff in here. People don't really understand when they're trading something like this. And that's my hope to share information with you also that you can make informed decisions. So we're going to see whether or not you can handle",

And you guys also are the one that pay my video editor. So he thanks you. And if what I do helps you in any way, consider signing up so that we can make better and better information and content for people. All right, let's get straight to it. Quick recap on what vertical credit spreads look like. And this is a put credit spread here. What you'll notice is that this is going to be a short option that is closer to the money along option that is a little further out of the money. They're going to be the same expiration, the same type, meaning both will be calls or puts. And then there will be the same number of longs and shorts. So this specific example here is looking at a spy put credit spread. You'll also hear them refer to as bowl put spreads stuff like that. I really stick to put credit spreads or put credit vertical spread,",

So I'm going to refer to it as that. So in this case, we are going to be selling to open one 29 December 448 put at 3.25. This is a 30 delta option. Then we're going to buy to open the 29 December 447 put for 3.2. This is a 28 delta option. And the net credit here is 23 bucks. That's what we're going to take in. These are the payoff diagrams for the individual options in case you forgot what these look like. This is going to be the underlying price. This is the PNL. As always, the short naked put is going to have unlimited downside. That's a big problem. That's why people like to trade these because when you combine them, this is what your payoff diagram looks like. And it's pretty cool. You, well, I'm not sure how I did that, but we got it back because in this kind of strategy you're going to have defined both profit and losses.

So as we reference this trade that we were just looking at, when we think about what you can lose, in this case, if you're collecting 23 upfront, the most you can lose is 77. And you know that right out of the gate. That is a great quality, especially for new traders because not blowing up is probably the primary priority for new traders in my opinion. The other thing in this case is they're very cheap. So the margin for this trade is literally your max loss. So in this case, it's 77 in this trade. They're very high probability trades. This one specifically is a 72 chance, probability of profit, which is great. And they're efficient. If you make your max profit here, which is 23, that would be a 29.9 return on invested capital. If you annualize that, it's really, really good in terms of efficiency. Now, let's talk about some of the primary issues before we get into the big one. This is a low gross returning strategy. In this case, for a dollar wide vertical, you're making 23. That's not that much money. It also has more friction because there are multiple legs.",

In this case, for a dollar wide vertical, you're making 23. That's not that much money. It also has more friction because there are multiple legs. If you think about your commissions, let's say you pay 65 cents per leg. That means on the way in, you are paying a dollar 30. For those that don't realize how massive that is on a 23 potential return, that's 5.7 of your max profit gone just on the entry. That doesn't include the exit. And this also doesn't include the slippage that you are inevitably going to pay because of the spreads. So they're very expensive for what they are. They also have a contradictory thesis in my opinion, or they're just inefficient in their expression. So what I mean by that is sometimes you'll hear, oh, if IV is high, then you sell credit spreads. Well, aren't you buying the exact thing you were saying is too expensive? It kind of doesn't make sense. And more important than that, they're not the most efficient way to capture these different kinds of expressions. So we'll talk a little bit about that later. And the other thing, you are risking relatively a much larger sum of money to make a much smaller amount of money. This is exactly why they tend to be high probability strategies. So that leads",

And it's looking at 1 wide options. This does not include cost of commissions. And you can see that total strategy PNL is negative 142. It's just looking at one loss. You lose money. That's what this comes down to. This is not even including fees, which I was just explaining to you are really, really bad. So what's going on here? Well, if we take a look at that previous example that I was showing you and we get back to 1 wide, where you're collecting 0.23. In this case, right out of the gate, you have a negatively expectant strategy. The reason being is because the neutral credit, this means again, sans fees, not including fees, the neutral credit you would have to receive for this to have a 50, 50 probability a zero sum over the long run is 31 cents. You were collecting 0.23. You are nowhere near where you need to be in order to capture a neutral credit. This is using again, 1",

So you're going to have to pick products very carefully. They're not as efficient. You're not going to have as great return on invested capital.

Now, looking if you're bearish, again, just a few ideas, you can trade ratio put diagonals, long puts, both of those are completely fine. Or if you're trading volatility out, right, aka, I want to capture variance risk premiums, you can trade short straddles, short strangles. I have videos in the notes below on those as well. And again, for any of these, if you have to buy the wings either to protect catastrophic loss, the idea here is to go much further out of the money so that you are not giving up as much of the credit you're receiving specifically for vertical credit spreads. Again, there's no free lunch here. That's the problem. That's the uncomfortable reality of trading options is just because vertical credit spreads are what are accessible to you. It doesn't mean they're good. There's a reason why you're not going to see a lot of pros trading these. And it's because of these reasons. They're",

There's a reason why you're not going to see a lot of pros trading these. And it's because of these reasons. They're inefficient. They really do not capture any sort of advantage from the broad market in terms of positive expectancy and the strategy. It is what it is, man. So you have to see whether or not you can reconcile that and make something of it. Again, this isn't to say that there's never a point where this could fit into account, but in general, it has nowhere in my portfolio. And after looking back at the amount of time I wasted trading them, that's truly what it was, absolute waste. So if there's anything I left out, let me know. If there's any questions you have on the video here, any of the specific strategies, throw them in the comments below. I answer all of them because I love interacting with you guys. Don't forget, be an outlier. Put in the work. You can absolutely make this stuff work. It's just going to take some effort. See you all later.",
