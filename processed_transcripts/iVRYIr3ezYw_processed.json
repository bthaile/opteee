I don't think it's there I don't think you're going to get 50% in six months based on the current volume GME unfortunately the the best way to have a shot at doing something like that with like a reasonable probability of successes if there's a directional play but with volatility unless you leverage massively and if you leverage massively then obviously the risk of completely blowing up is there so yeah that's with volatility as it is right now I don't think that there's like a direct path to that that I would take personally. No one says is there ever time you would choose to use short spreads or just shorting a call put in what context do you mean in terms of my game stop position or do you mean in terms of like trading options in general because they're very different things the way that I trade options is based on what I call profit mechanisms which are like specific market effects that I'm trying to capture in game stop actually is its own profit mechanism for me because of some like we'll not some many of the",
