    "text": "I don't really think charts are predictive. I think charts give you a clue of the trend and trends fail. Most trends fail. Most breakouts fail is why risk management is so critical. That's kept me in the business for 30, I don't know. I started in 87. So whatever, how long that is? I don't know. If you try to trend follow and you don't have risk management, you're going to wipe down quickly. It is the market will seek its level. It will find your weakness. If you're greedy, if you're impulsive, if you're fearful, I mean, whatever your weakness is, the market is going to expose you quickly. And then you're going to learn about yourself very quickly. You're going to take a lot of losses and a lot of bruises.",
