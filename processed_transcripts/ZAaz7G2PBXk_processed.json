    "text": "Boom, 2023 trading year is done. The SP 500 returned 23.7. It's 10 year compound annual growth rate is now just over 7. So what does this mean? As a trader, this is the time we got to face the music. How did we do? What worked? What didn't work? Having a bad year once in a while is okay. If you are trailing the market multiple years on a road, especially a year like this, that the market absolutely crushed it, you have to take a really hard look at what you're doing in while you're trading. Because if the goal is to grow your capital as efficiently as possible and you're not pacing the market in years like this, it's a giant problem. Unless you are really bolstering your skill set and you are able to close that gap going forward. Trading is a game of incremental progress. You cannot waste any year. You literally cannot afford it. So think tactically on how you're going to approach 2024. Be an outlier seal later.",
