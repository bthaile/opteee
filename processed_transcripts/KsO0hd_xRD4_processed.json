    "text": "Learn and spend your time with a purpose. The markets don't care how long it takes you to pick up a concept. Like we say in the Marine Corps, we train to a standard, not to a time. Doesn't matter how long it takes. The reason why this is so important is because when you're taking your time to learn, or even if you're just exploring markets, there is a really positive component about subconscious priming, which is pattern recognition, which happens as you look at things over time. That's a natural subconscious element. But you should also be highly intentional. So as you're looking at a chart before you start just looking at random stuff, define what you're going to look at in why. I'm going to look at these three moving averages. I'm going to look at the relationships between them, the slopes, the width, price relationship relative to them. And I'm going to use that as to help me understand where the dominant price trend is over time frame. Be intentional. Be an outlier sailor.",
