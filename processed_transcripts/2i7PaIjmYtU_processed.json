    "text": "Let's talk about the failure rate of traders in why you've heard metrics as high as 95. It's because it's exceedingly deceiving. Most of us start trading, thinking that it's going to be fast easy money, and you can genuinely make a lot of money trading. I have, but I can promise you it's not been easy. I just finished my 18th year of trading, and it is taken a long time. I don't pick up things that quickly to figure this whole thing out. So one of the healthiest things you can do to actually stand a shot at trading is to treat it with respect it deserves. In order to be successful as a trader, you literally have to be an outlier. It means that you have to do things differently than other people, and it means that you have to put in enough work to have a different outcome from other people. And it's not easy, it's simple, but not easy. Be an outlier see you later.",
