    "text": "a look at the 18th here here's the most interesting part about this whole thing and the fact that I love options markets because they tell us a whole lot if we take a look at the one- day premium flow specifically for the call side not a whole lot to write home about right kind of quiet nothing really sticking out at me but as soon as we Zoom this out what do you notice pretty quiet for the last week and then on the 17th all of a sudden call premium skyrockets this is people playing that news they're playing that movement and then take a look at what happens today people are dumping this is people selling these calls into strength and realizing their profits to go trade another thing it's a really funny and fun trade idea but the broader context here I think from the technology standpoint is it's pretty neat to see the different kinds of technology that exist and how they're being integrated into the automotive sphere but it's also really fun to see the market impact on a smaller company like laser and see how profound it absolutely can distort short-term price by shifting sentiment as always if you have any questions let me know be an outlier see you later",
