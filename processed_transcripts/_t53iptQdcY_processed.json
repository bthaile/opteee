    "text": "what's up outliers let's talk about how to literally revolutionize your trading with reframing the way that we think about how we're placing positions we're going to talk about profit mechanisms this is just a framework in a way of thinking that I've developed over my last 18 years in the markets nothing you're going to see here is novel revolutionary secret proprietary this is all just basic stuff that most of you probably have bits and pieces but but I want to show you how in my brain I pull all of this together to make smarter trades that make more money so what's up outliers let's get into why you should care about what we're about to talk about so first let's start with a scenario and we have to start with the basic understanding that our performance as Traders is literally a reflection of what our skill level is and what our strategies produce over time the reason why this is important to note is because if we get into this very first scenario and we have a Trader that has built a strategy that's designed to profit from expanding volatility and they choose to buy a call then the trade makes money so in this case we don't know yet if the stock went up or if volatility expanded but at this point most Traders are happy with this scenario because they made money what's the rub well the question we have to ask ourselves is",
