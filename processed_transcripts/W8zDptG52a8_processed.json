    "text": "Let's up, Alias. I'm going to walk you through a quick trade in the Russell was part of our new Tuesday series where I'm just sharing some trades. They're not all going to be winning trades. Actually, a lot of things that I do lose money, but this one was a very simple idea that happened to play out. So I'm going to walk you through it. As you know, we had the Fed cuts rates today's the 10th of December. So coming into this, I opted to place a trade. And I want to walk through the logic behind what I did in why. So first things first, let's zoom out just a little bit further. And I want to show you the performance of the Russell compared to the other indices. The reason why this matters is because the relationship of the Russell has been a little bit lagging, kind of slower. But you can see on the day today that the Russell had an outsized day compared to the others. It was up 1.4% almost. This has everything to do in my opinion with the fact that small caps are typically more rate sensitive than large caps. It also comes down to this other function. This was the primary signal in this trade. We're going to bring a pro internal stream yesterday where we literally just look through the markets a little bit more in detail. We came across this and I'm looking at a historical probability",

We're going to bring a pro internal stream yesterday where we literally just look through the markets a little bit more in detail. We came across this and I'm looking at a historical probability graph. What this is showing us is that as of yesterday, nine December, there was an 88.6% probability of a cut and in 11.36 probability of no cut. Why is that so notable to me? The fact that the market was still that split coming into this overall generally expected rate cut told me a lot. It told me that they're likely we're going to be players that were not fully positioned if the cut did happen. This also led to an expectation that if a cut didn't happen like most of the others that were higher probability that it would be catastrophic that the market would probably react very poorly in the near term. Because of this discrepancy, that led to a two different trade ideas for me. The first trade idea was actually to play the possibility for no cut and then the subsequent drop. I had that playbook ready to go. If it seemed like that was likely to occur. It didn't seem likely to occur. The other scenario ended up being what I ended up playing, which was because this discrepancy was high enough. I didn't feel like this move was going to be fully priced",

There's still a not insignificant minority, not a significant amount, but it's not insignificant. Minority of positioners that would need to react to this news in some way. What did I do? I kept it super simple. As you guys know, as part of the AAR process after action review for trades, these are the main things that I'm going to cover. I'm not going to go through them in order. You'll kind of hear them as I go. But this is what I saw. This is a five minute chart in Russell on the day. And my entry took place right there. It's this candle if I zoom in and I'll explain why. The reason why I wanted to capture this part of the move here is we're ended up entering. It was like 1050-ish Pacific time. It was actually a little closer to 1055. What I was attempting to capture here was asymmetric upside. My expectation was that when the rate statement came out, I was anticipating a pretty aggressive up move right after. And because of that, I wanted to get the trade on before the release happened because there's also always going to",

And because of that, I wanted to get the trade on before the release happened because there's also always going to be early players that get the information just a little bit earlier. So I opted to front run the move slightly. The way that I did that was through futures. It's just a pure directional play. I bought 15 of the Russell futures at around 2332 that took about 220k in margin. And I placed a stop at 2528 and a half, which represents a total loss of 2625. You can see that the total risk here is miniscule, especially compared to the capital being used in the trade. Why is that? It's because in my idea here, I was either going to be right or I was going to be wrong. I didn't want to play a lot of the middle ground. If I was right in my idea, played out, it should not go down. Literally at all. It should just go up. If my idea didn't pan out and let's say it had a down tick and then it ran up, I would got stopped out, but that wouldn't have been my idea. So I still would have been wrong even if it ended up going up. This was a very specific idea. I still gave it",

This was a very specific idea. I still gave it a little breathing room as I always do. What that means is I didn't put it on top of where I entered. I still absolutely gave the trade some breathing room. I actually targeted giving it enough room to play with this recent consolidation that it had in Trudeau. And then using this as a general anchor point. So where I would have been getting out would have been like down here. Well with them reason for the idea that I was playing. Now what ended up happening was kind of simple. As I entered the trade, we had a beginning of a move up. This was not as severe as I expected at all. I thought that this first candle was going to be quite a bit more. It wasn't until the second candle that I got more of the move, which ended up giving back some before Powell started to speak here, which had a surge, a drop, and then a continued rally. What I did was simply use a mix of short-term moving averages. That's it. That's how I managed the profit on the way up sliding my stop up. So what that looks like is the",

That's how I managed the profit on the way up sliding my stop up. So what that looks like is the stop lived down here first. After these first two candles, I slide the stop up to here. And it needs to be a close on the five-minute candle below, or if it exceeds by a certain percentage threshold, either of those conditions will get me out. Then I'm just sliding it up, sliding it up, continuing to follow the broader momentum. And then if I slide you out to a 15 minute, you'll kind of see a little more clearly the exit that I took. The exit occurred on this candle. So all I was doing was playing this broader continuation. And then as soon as it started reversing, as I was sliding up the stop, that's where I took my exit. It was literally as soon as it started meaningfully moving below these two candles in this consolidation zone. But that led to was exiting the arrow, oh my bad. The arrows in the wrong spot.

The cool part about this capital though is that in terms of idea research, execution, how much baby sitting it needed. And then the time that this money was made, it's insanely high, return on a vesic capital. And I'll give you a sense of what that is. It's a 10-ish percent move in less than two hours. If you roll that out to just be 10% in a day, it's like the annual, I mean, I can't even read you the number on annualized return. It's that big. The key thing here is that this trade was either going to be wrong, quickly, and lose a tiny bit of money, or it was going to be right, quickly, and make also not a ton of money. This move here in Russell wasn't that big. Like this total range is like a percent and a half. So it's not like I was going to make a ton of money here.
