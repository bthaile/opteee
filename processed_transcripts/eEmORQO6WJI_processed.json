So the goal of this video is actually to walk through his options position and talk about the settlement that's coming up on 21 June and how that might play out and the potential impacts to the markets. Now, to be very clear, I'm nowhere near as close to this entire saga as a lot of other people are and shout out to the apes. However, I am familiar with options. So I want to focus on that perspective. I'll definitely tie in as much general information as I can, but it would be super helpful if you guys can throw in the comments, the pieces that help fit this whole story together, because I'm trying to share as much information as I can about the position. What's up, everyone? Eric here. Welcome back to the outliers. Let's get right in. So we have this gym to start off with. And this essentially says screw it. If DFV exercises that I don't know if it's a banana or a plant teen is going in someone's rectum, the bold move cotton and we'll see if this person indeed has 50 pound testies because that's probably what they're going to need in order to facilitate that movement. But I want to highlight that because if you want to talk about one of the most fascinating groups",

This is hilarious to me and everything that they're doing and everything that they're standing for is also so cool. It's why I hold shares of both AMC and GME. It's literally just to support you guys in your movement because I find it so cool. All right. So let's talk a little bit about what's going on in the last few days. So this is from Superstank and we saw a position posted by DFV. And this is again on the second of June and it highlights his initial position. So what I see here is that we have 5 million shares of GameStop at 21, 27 and then we have 120,000 of the 21 June 20 calls that were entered in at 5, 6, 75, 4 average price. So you can see the value of these positions and then he's sitting in about 29 mil cash. This actually is pretty important. By the way, this 29 million cash.

And let's take a look at what was posted on the third of June. We can see that he was up 78.6 million dollars at the time of that post. That's wild. And the position was doing well. And then we can fast forward again to the 6th of June. So this is yesterday, today's the seventh of the June, the day of the live stream. We'll grab some pieces from that in just a second. And you can see his position here up a quarter of a billion dollars. Again, absolutely crazy. So a couple things to know. As of this posting, the position obviously was crushing it and there's been a lot of speculation. There's been people popping up like this from Citroen research who this dude is known to be short GameStop. We know he has a short GameStop position. And it's not surprising at all to see him taking this angle, essentially trying to diminish the value of the position and trying to paint it in a negative light because quite literally his fund depends on it. He's in terrible, terrible position right now. You can take a look at this article from Yahoo Finance and he got crushed on his previous attempt. And now he is back at it.

And now he is back at it. So and as you can see from here, he's back at attempting to short the stock. Now his position so far would have been up then down if we take a reference of how the performance has been so far, at least in the past week. And you can see it's pretty sporadic. I'll get myself out of the way so that you can see because the volume bars here matter a lot. So his short would have been absolutely hammered here. It's not looking great here either, but definitely better off than where it was early in the week. But the reason why all of that matters is because there's a lot of people out there that are trying to kind of press this down from an institutional perspective. And you can see relics of that, which again, there's something to be said about just being wrong in a position. Okay. So let's get over here and let's get into the details a bit more on his actual position and what this could look like.

When you're purchasing options like this, you are paying for them upfront in cash. So this means that at this juncture, obviously he had enough cash to enter this entire position and he still has 29.5 million left over. However, if you notice, the noctional value of this position is massive and it's much more capital than what he has available now. It's essentially equivalent to 12 million shares, which in addition to his five million would make him the fourth largest shareholder, which brings on a bunch of SEC regulations when it comes to his positions going forward from that. But the main thing of interest here is the fact that people are talking about whether he's going to exercise, how he wants to approach that. And one of the big issues is having the capital to exercise because right here, he's not even close. He needs a lot more money in order to be able to exercise this entire thing. Now let's talk about those scenarios though. The first scenario, it doesn't look like it's very likely to happen, is the options could expire worthless. What scenario would they expire worthless if these 20 calls that are out in 21 June fall out of the money? So for example, if we",

What scenario would they expire worthless if these 20 calls that are out in 21 June fall out of the money? So for example, if we come in here to today's expiration, all of these options that are out of the money will be worth nothing. They will expire worthless. His options right now are very deep in the money. Even with the recent down moves, there's still over an 80 delta trading essentially for double the value that he got in at. So overall, you can see that his position is still completely fine. He's the lion's share of this open interest existing and there's only 13,600 transacted today at this level. Now the other thing I noticed when I was looking at this is it has tremendous call skew, right? It's a real surprise based on his position, but his position is large enough to completely skew the options as they sit from a volume perspective. And if we go to OI, you can see that there's massive, massive call skew, which for those that don't know, you typically see puts skew with things priced into the downside. But if we isolate the series that he's in, you can see that he's again a big pusher of the call skew here. But even without him, there still is some call skew present, which is",

Now if we take a look at the following expiration beyond that, there's even still some residual call skew, although it's a little bit lighter. And if we look at these shorter term, explorations, there is slight put skew. So right now the markets are a little bit all over the place, but you can see that there is option transactions leading to upward pricing thesis that's pretty clear for me to identify. Another thing that I find really interesting as of right now is notice the implied volatility for the near term explorations compared to this 21 June. This actually surprises me and it might be the market expecting him not to have the capital to actually exercise his shares. Because if we go back over here and we look at these other scenarios, if he tries to sell to close this position entirely possible, but it's 120,000 shares in time is starting to dwindle.

So the market makers will be able to have a bit of a field day with the liquidity here in terms of the spreads that they quote him. They still have to be fair, but you'll get definitely beat up on the spreads and on exit liquidity. Then we have the really interesting scenarios exercise and this is where Mo as absolutely comes into the conversation. Now how much into the conversation it comes is up for debate because if we take a look at if he does exercise, if he does have the capital or his access to the capital in order to support onboarding all of these shares, including marginal value, if you choose to take them on margin, the market makers then need to locate this 12 million shares of a generally low float stock. This kicks off what very likely can be a massive gamma squeeze. Gamma squeezes are very similar to a short squeeze, except the primary difference here is that it's driven by market maker behavior, not individual trader, not the trader perspective. It's driven by market makers. And this can have pretty serious cascading effects because",

    "text": "likely can be a massive gamma squeeze. Gamma squeezes are very similar to a short squeeze, except the primary difference here is that it's driven by market maker behavior, not individual trader, not the trader perspective. It's driven by market makers. And this can have pretty serious cascading effects because this increases demand for the stock heavily. And again, the fact that it's low float is really, really important. What started to cause this is again by the ape community very smartly DRSing their shares. So that kind of system, the direct registration system essentially locks those shares up so that they can't be moved around. Now when we look at the overall short position as it sits now, you can see that the short interest is actually scaling up. It's 68 million. And this is where it gets interesting. The short interest ratio right now is 3.3 days to cover. This is where it starts to get very interesting because as the percentage of shares shorted goes up slightly, they become even more scarce. The duration to cover them as it goes up causes an issue because then we have to locate shares quickly that are not there as other people are trying to get to those same shares. And that's what creates a scarcity, gamma squeeze, then short squeeze. So this is a fascinating position to have on right now of interest. However, is this game stop is potentially looking to offer more? This can cause further share",

So this is a fascinating position to have on right now of interest. However, is this game stop is potentially looking to offer more? This can cause further share dilution. The timing of this being brought up was a little strange compared to when DFV started talking about his positions. But again, you guys know way more about this than I do. So I would love any ideas on the connection here. But I find the timing of this interesting. There are pros and cons in terms of the gamma squeeze thesis, the severity of it would be diminished by this process. However, so for those that don't know, you can go to DFV's page right here and you can check out all of his recent posts. And it shows essentially by the last few days what this has been looking like. And if you check out his live stream from today, you can see his positions as they were. And most importantly, you can be reinforced at how this dude has quite literal diamond hands as he's down 235 million still holding like a freaking soldier. The other thing is the stream was kind of interesting. I didn't catch the whole thing, but you could tell that this is a really smart dude that is doing a lot of trolling. And I love to see it.

I didn't catch the whole thing, but you could tell that this is a really smart dude that is doing a lot of trolling. And I love to see it. It's some of the coolest stuff to watch somebody with this kind of capital playing the games that he is against the people that he is. It's just an absolute blast. Now the tricky part here again is this cash perspective. So if we go back in here and we think about the exercise scenario, there's another scenario in here where there could be a partial exercise where he doesn't exercise his entire position, but some of it. And that would still have a similar effect potentially causing a gamus squeeze, but it might not be to the same magnitude. So whether or not you care about this or not whether or not you're a game stop buyer seller, none of that really matters. If you're involved in markets at all, you should be watching this. This is an absolute anomaly, a spectacle of a scenario that might not ever happen again. If you have any questions or anything to add to the dialogue, please throw it in the comments below so I can learn more about this alongside with you guys. Be an outlier. I'll see you all later.",
