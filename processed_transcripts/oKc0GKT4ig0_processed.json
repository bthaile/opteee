    "text": "Does technical analysis even work? This is a common question and the answer is absolutely it does. Now, it's like any other kind of analysis though. There's no magic. It's not going to give you a predictive outcome. Technical analysis is very useful for a probabilistic assessment of things. That means that if we have a stock that falls below, for example, it's 50-day moving average. It's more likely to at least go down in additional day. That doesn't mean every single time it's going to. But very frequently it will. So the way to think about technical analysis is that it's literally just observing price behavior. This is the actual supply and demand function of people going in the market and doing things. It's their footprint. So you can learn how people are behaving and what they're trying to do because it's important to remember. Institutions in big money can't move that fast. Takes multiple days for them to build positions. So it absolutely does work. It's just not magic. Being all our sale later.",
