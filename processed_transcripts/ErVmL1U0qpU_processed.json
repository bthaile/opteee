    "text": "Make it a habit. One of the best possible ways to make meaningful progress on things is to tie it to something that you already enjoy doing regularly. Motivation is utter bullshit. It doesn't last. It comes in. It goes. It cannot be relied on if you're trying to make meaningful progress in something. However, consistency is one of the most underappreciated superpowers that exist. It's how I've made the progress that I have. I don't do anything spectacular, but I do things moderately well, super consistently. Make it a habit. It's a super power. Be an outlier. See you all later.",
