    "text": "Losses that haunt me, options trading wiped out my savings. Who else? This is a post on Reddit from a appropriately named person, I quit options, which is probably fair. And I thought this post was really interesting and worth diving into because this highlights a couple really important points. But more importantly, I want to talk to you about how you can avoid this. This is entirely avoidable and it's not that difficult to avoid. It simply requires having a plan and thinking through methods to become successful at trading. However, there's some absolutely vital steps that have to be taken that I want to talk about. So first, let's just talk about this in the context. I'm grabbing my drawing pad because we're going to need a couple examples as we work through this. The first thing is, I don't know how to start this. I'm 42X banker and pretty good with money or so I thought. This part sticks out to me and it's because of, they're not saying this, they're, but it's a common assumption and it's the appeal to authority. Lots of people will take somebody's position and their status and not weigh the thought action activities by themselves. And again, they're extremely humble here, right? I'm not saying they're saying this, but it's very common where people will think like, oh, somebody works within the finance industry, air go, they're going to be a good trader. And it's just patently false. And if we",

And it's just patently false. And if we take a look at that and just click in a little bit, if we compare institutional investing slash trading and we compare that against retail, there are a litany of very important differences between the two. It summarizes that institution and institutional trading have a lot of baked in edge and structural advantages available to them. That's not available on the retail trading side. And the fun fact is when you become a retail trader, you have to wear a lot of different hats. One of the big things that sticks out to me here is risk oversight, dedicated risk management departments predefined firm wide risk limits. There are literally, and this is actually used to be a not prestigious position that became a very prestigious position to become. And it's because it is so important to the success of an institution. Well, as a retail trader, you are that for you. And as you could tell from our friend here, they clearly don't have good risk control in place.

And this is really simple to begin with as a trader because there's only one point in time you can ever fully control the risk of a trade and it's when you enter it. That means you're defining your risk based on the size of the position. And this still applies to undefined risk trades. You can still roughly define your risk based on the size that you put on or capping with a wing or something like that. So let's continue. I got into options trading during the pandemic happened to a lot of people. What started as something casual turned into a daily obsession, this is also good or bad. It can be both. It was an obsession for me as well. And you kind of need a certain level of obsession to learn this stuff. So I don't weigh that either way. It's all myself. I was being strategic, but I was really just chasing dopamine and losses. It's actually quite self aware. And this is very, very common. There are a lot of research papers on this topic of sensation seeking. This is a little bit of an older paper. It's from 2006. It's called sensation seeking overconfidence and trading activity. It talks about this exact thing where traders very frequently will exhibit and display this kind of behavior. Well, we're just looking for this sensation",

Well, we're just looking for this sensation of winning, making good trades and stuff like that. All things that unfortunately run contrary to building a solid foundational approach, which we'll talk about. Fast forward to now. And now I've lost over 88, whatever this metric is, looks like 88 million of whatever that currency is. It looks like they're Indian in two years. Didn't happen all at once. Small losses turned into bigger ones. Few wins gave me false confidence kept adding capital. Probably self make it back. This is called revenge trading standard avoidant behavior that you don't want. I ignored red flags. Hit it from my family convinced myself one trade away from fixing it all. That's gambler's fallacy. And so let's let's talk about what happened here. This is just an utter and complete breakdown in process. So what ends up happening is you go through your learning phases as a trader. There's an important thing called the Dunning Kruger effect. And it's after you go through you learn a bit and you start to feel confident in what you've learned. And then all of a sudden, you tend to make a mistake or a series of mistakes like they did.

And I have a bunch of videos that talk about the concepts of implementation of a portfolio, but it boils down to figuring out how many trades you need to put on in order to hit your desired return target and then making sure that those trades all composite fall within a risk tolerance. And there's one way you can ensure they do by adding a circuit breaker. So this effectively says if the portfolio loses more than X percent, whatever that percent is, that you will then begin closing positions because it means something is gone drastically wrong. You can't just pick a random number because it needs to be fit to the strategies that you're running and the size of the portfolio and the kind of things that you're doing. So the way that we figure out a circuit breaker is by literally analyzing the strategies, the average PNL, the average drawdown for our strategies and then arriving at this number. And if you're thinking, wow, that sounds like something I haven't done yet. It's the point. This is the work that needs to be done in order to make logical decisions as a trader.

There's no open trades right now. The PNL for the strategy is 130,000, average PNL, all these different metrics. Notice how all of these metrics are here. And notice how it's organized in the context of an individual strategy. Notice how this would otherwise be tied into what the individual trades being built out are down here.
