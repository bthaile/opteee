    "text": "Again, the main differentiation between how I'm going to roll short puts versus short calls short puts. I typically roll pretty aggressively to manage my basis. So I don't get stuck at a top. The short calls I rarely will roll unless it's I can clearly make a lot more money. But otherwise, allowing assignment here is a big part of the strategy because it frees up capital of long equity that we can now offer again via the cash secured puts.",
