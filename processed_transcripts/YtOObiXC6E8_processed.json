    "text": "What's up to all the outliers, Eric here, and I legitimately have a great video for you on managing deep in the money short puts. This is what I do. This is my bread and butter, and it is really the more interesting part of trading to me. Obviously, it's nice to put on a trade and for it to make money, no drama there, but this is where trading really happens, not just one more directionally right, right out of the gate. So let's take a look at the trade. I'm gonna show you a chart for some context first, and then I will give you the details of the trade itself. This is where I entered the trade. This is IWM. This is part of my core portfolio. I bring that up because there's very different ways that I approach my core portfolio compared to my speculative portfolio. It's the same portfolio, it's just different allocations. And in this case, I am trading the covered strangle. Now, when I look at this first trade that we got on, IWM was trading around to 10, and then this is where the first role occurred on the 28th of April, and then here we are down here. From here to here, to about 175, 176 is about a 16 move. So we've sustained a meaningful move against us in the position. Directionally, we have been incorrect completely. Now, as I look at this from a technical standpoint, I definitely perceive",

Directionally, we have been incorrect completely. Now, as I look at this from a technical standpoint, I definitely perceive more risk to the downside than upside potential. That's an important undertone as I make further decisions about how I want to manage this trade. I also see a couple levels of interest to me, like this 189, this 182, as potential resistance. We're still still stepping down with lower highs, which is not good. Overall, I perceive more downside than upside. I say all of that because it will paint the rest of the picture of the portfolio and the strategy that we're deploying. Now, as I said, we're looking at IWM. The plan is the coverage strangle, a favorite of mine. When I look at the series of trades, I'm gonna walk through my thought process because I haven't made a decision yet, and that's part of the reason I'm doing this video. Today is 19th of May, and I haven't made a choice yet, but it's coming up on time to do something because X-Transic value is dwindling down very quickly.

The general undertone here is conservative. I have been no more than 20 invested across my entire portfolio so far this year, and it's because I do not trust the markets. This is one of the primary ways that I manage risk is via sizing and what I offer to the market in my allocations. So that is the general background behind the size of the trade.

Okay, so moving on to the first roll on the 28th of April, when IWO is trading around 189. So that represents about an 11 down move and where I entered to my first roll. And I bought to close those 202 puts at 1260, and then I sold to open six of the 17 June 200 puts at 1330. Now, a couple of things happens here, happened here. The first one is I was able to reduce my basis slightly from 202 to 200, so that's a 1 reduction in my basis. I also kept the size the same. So what I mean by that is I kept a six lot to a six lot. One of my favorite ways to manage these kind of trades, especially in a down move is to slowly scale into the trade towards my full allocation, which technically is up to 100 of my portfolios, what I would allow for this style of trade. We're not quite there, because I have other positions on, and I'm not looking to scale in quite that aggressively, but just to give you some general context.

So what's happened thus far is I collected 3.38 in some credit, then I realized a loss when I bought to close them, and then I opened up a new trade with 1330 and overall credit. So I have a total unrealized, realized net PNL of 2448. This includes the trade that's open right now. The realized PNL is down 5,532. That's what I realized in loss on this trade right here. Now, the return on capital invested capital for the trade as it sets with the net PNL is 2.04 and annualized, it's at 14.6. I bring that up because on an annual return, this still isn't bad. I'm not worried about this trade, and this again continues to shape and inform how I choose to manage the position. So this is the main set of choices I have ahead of me. Do I want to try to roll out in down or just roll out? Do I want to take shares in and actually turn it into the covered strangle by taking assignment and then selling covered calls, or do I want to add risk, meaning increase total size so that I can make more aggressive adjustment on these puts?

If I pull up the current options chain, and we take a look at where my deep in the money puts are, which is they're an 80 delta right now, they have about 13 cents, 12.5 cents of extrinsic value. So once it gets below a dime, it is time to do something because early assignment becomes increasingly more probable, even though there's 22 days left to go. It's unlikely if it's right around a dime, but I don't want to deal with it if it starts trading for four cents, five cents, and there's just not that much money left to pull out of it. So in this instance, I'm going to look and say, okay, the midpoint on this theoretical value, somewhere 2377, sorry, 2387, something like that. And I'm going to look to see what I could get if I rolled out in time. So first, I'll take a look at going to these 42 days to expiration, same strike. Those are trading for 24, 20, something like that. And that doesn't give me a lot of money on that role in terms of the credit that I would ultimately receive. So that",

I want to go a little bit further out of the money to enable upside potential. It's a way that I compensate for the cost to carry. And those are only giving me 40 something cents.

I'm not stoked about taking on shares and selling covered calls. So that leads me to out and down or increasing size. If I can roll out and down, I would. But if I take a look at these 42 days of expiration, the 200 puts, I cannot collect enough credit in order to have a net credit on the roll.

So that leads to a couple other choices. I could look, maybe go a little further out in time. Maybe I go to these 15 July, 57 days to expiration. And then I check out those 199s. These are going for, it looks like 2369, right around there, 2369. And then again, if I pop back, see where we're at, 2369 simply is not enough. And that's even if I go out 50 something days. So then just to see where I would have to go in order to get a credit and be able to roll down, I could go 92 days out. I could look at these 199s or I could even look at these 198s. So it's a viable choice if I wanted to go 92 days out. Not super inclined to do that right now. If I look at this list, what I would be most inclined to do is increase size. I wouldn't completely discount rolling out after I look at the choices available to",

I wouldn't completely discount rolling out after I look at the choices available to me. Again, I didn't look at this before I did the video with you guys. So I was looking at it as I went. I'm not stoked on out, but I am right now favoring increasing size. Because as I look at some size choices, I could potentially add maybe two contracts. Still keep it very, very small, take it from a six to an eight lot. My overall allocation would be very small. But what that would allow me to do is probably go from these 200s down to these 195s. And that starts to become more meaningful. Because again, if we do tip and continue this bear market, I'm gearing up for a near 300 day duration down move. So by continuing to slide into the trade via size, but reducing my basis as such, it gives me the most flexibility for when I ultimately do decide to take assignment, I will take assignment on a size that I'm comfortable with, and be able to sell short calls at something that makes a little more sense. Because again, if I go to these 57 days out, let's take a look at these 195s. I'm now collecting 1.60. That's",

Because again, if I go to these 57 days out, let's take a look at these 195s. I'm now collecting 1.60. That's pretty healthy for something that's 57 days out at a 195. This is a low delta, it's an 18 delta. So I could even again, go a little further above that to give me some upside potential and still collect a meaningful amount of credit that it starts to be worthwhile or even sell the covered calls at a ratio, which is a favorite of mine. So if let's say I take this to an eight lot and I end up getting assigned 800 shares at 195, let's just say everything, setters, parabets, everything else is the same. And we're looking at it right now in that same scenario. I could then sell six of these 198 calls that still gives me 3, 3 upside potential. I'm still collecting 600 something bucks for 15 delta short calls, but I'm still not capping the upside. I have 200 on cap shares. One of my favorite approaches. So right now, as I write this, make this video, that is what I'm leaning towards. Probably increasing size very, very slightly and increasing the overall allocation into the trade so that I can take in a bigger credit, move five points down, which decreases",

And then it gives me a little more room to continue scaling in if the market doesn't accommodate me, which I honestly don't think it will at this point, but I am comfortable starting to scale into this trade a little bit because I have plenty of capital. I could put into this if I need to. So that's what I'm thinking right now. Again, just making a video as I'm thinking about managing this trade. If you have any questions, let me know. It's fun conversation. I haven't made a decision yet. I will do an update video when I make the trade probably tomorrow the next day, next day being Monday, depending on where those puts move. But I'm definitely going to wait for them to go below a dime just so that I can squeak out as much time as possible to get a better feel for what the market's actually doing. Are we starting to see a little bit? Maybe if we start seeing some support here, oh, those are fibs. Sorry, I didn't mean to put those in there. If we start seeing",

Maybe if we start seeing some support here, oh, those are fibs. Sorry, I didn't mean to put those in there. If we start seeing a little bit of support at these levels, I might feel a little bit differently as in if we're starting to base somewhere in here at 175. And then we start trading between a range here and maybe bouncing up out of there. That would be great. And if that happened, I would be even more comfortable scaling in. So what I'm doing is I'm trying to pull every last ounce of extrinsic value out of this trade to give me more time to analyze where this thing might be going in my opinion and then make a decision based on how the rest of the portfolio looks as well.
