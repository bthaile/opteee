So we just wrapped up a massive massive massive run through of the diamond handbook which is over 800 pages and we are getting right back into the weeds. So that's actually the gameplay for today is we're going to continue on working through the dd library. I figured that we would start with a quick overview of gamestop for those that don't know I am still doing the update every Tuesday Wednesday kind of depends on the week but on standalone video for gamestop on Tuesdays and this last week was a little bit of our make or break week and yeah it looks a little bit more on the break side but before we get too far into the weeds as always I'd like to say hello to everybody see who's hanging out looks like we got Alberto Dersh Lup Gustin dark mark what's up everybody dark mark says you got Strictlin or duplesey I would probably go with Strictlin I genuinely think Strictlin edgeed him out in that first flight um yeah I mean duplesey is so unorthodox with respect to a fighting style it's fascinating it really really is fascinating but at this point I'm just still sad boy because I haven't really been able to train anything for now",

A comment on the subreddit may be revisited of rule paths by the ICC flew under the radar another sign for our crash coming they passed a new rule effective 1 June 21 but let's see the principal purpose proposes to to modify ICC's fee schedules to introduce credit default swap credit default index swapshin incentive programs for the second half of 21 they do not require any changes the ICC they're providing incentive programs to purchase credit default swap indices they're like standard credit default swaps but packaged together like an index kind of like an index.
