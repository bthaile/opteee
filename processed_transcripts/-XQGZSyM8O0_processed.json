It's taught me a lot, actually, about myself, about my life, about my dad, which is a really strange topic, not worth going into here. But yeah, that's been interesting. But the cool part about not being able to train is I've been spending a lot of time kind of watching tape and just researching and doing the best I can to learn not through obviously being able to go through the physical pieces, but being able to just monitor and watch stuff and learn that by. So yeah, I just, I think Strickland won that first fight. The most frustrating part is like the UFC when things go to the judges, you know, the biggest thing is damage. And if you just look at the dude's faces at the end of that fight, do plus he was fucked up. Strickland doesn't didn't really look like he had been touched. So. And then he obviously had the headbutt, which cut his eye, but other than a cut. Yeah, interesting first fight, but that is also the downside of somebody like Strickland is that he is, I mean, generally more of a points fighter, right? Like you're going to see one, two's and teaps, lots of one, two teaps, which are good. It's effective, but that brings it and it puts it in a judge's",

But let's get over to the main screen. And let's take peak at where GameStop current is. So GameStop current analysis. Let's see. This is unfortunate to me. So this part is unfortunate for a few reasons. This breakdown below this level, and I already flagged it to you guys in my opinion, as a pretty key level from just an accumulation, distribution, style perspective and it's looking very, very, I mean, it's trading right down essentially to the 200 day MA. This, there's not a lot of volume here. So one of the things I had noted when we spoke about this last time is I felt that this relationship in there was super important in that a break below this likely would mean a likely extension to the downside. So as soon as it broke below this, I actually had bought puts. This is separate from the coverage strangle that I talked you all about. And I had bought puts, expecting something to this degree, some sort of actual downside velocity picking up, not that I'm long term bearish on",

I still have the coverage strangle on. We can run through obviously that whole position. I normally do that on the Tuesday video. So everything, I mean, no real changes with the coverage strangle side of things. I am glad that I scaled down a little bit on the shares that was in hindsight, a smart move. A lot of that was based on intuition. But when you see something breaking down like this, you generally have to wait until there's some sort of stronger catalyst for an upside. This is distribution. So this is some sort of larger entity or series of entities that are unwinding their positions. This that's not to say that that's people trying to force the price down and stuff like that.

A lot of times that will be marked by selling from some sort of entity.

So this absolutely can just be something that's like, OK, I see this starting to trail down. I'm going to take my profits because again, from the coverage strangle perspective, the way I trade that typically is not dissimilar to that because here's the way that it typically works, especially from a trader's lens. If let's say I bought in here and the stock rallies, which is great. And then it starts to roll over. Well, from a trading lens, what I don't want to do is just hold it while all of the gains that I accumulated here a road away, I get nothing from that. At the end of that position, I essentially am back where I started. The only thing that has occurred is time has passed and I have nothing to show for it. So",

I mean, this is the next spot that typically would be flagged for consolidation would be something around here, the 200 day MA. That's a generally large moving average. And then below that, it's down here down in the 22 handle.

But joking comments aside, there was actually an important comment this one here. And this is from, oh, that's funny. I was wearing the same shirt in this one. Hold on, I missed it. I wanted to highlight it for you guys this one. This is a, this is an interesting question. So coffee's coffee donuts and Homer had a really interesting question that I do think is worth discussing. And they're saying after all you've seen with GameStop, how can you say the market makers don't want to hurt retail traders? And the, for those that didn't see the short, this YouTube short is essentially saying the market is indifferent to you. So what I mean by that is the market doesn't care that you need to make or want to make or trying to make 1 this week, this month, this, whatever, that the market doesn't care what you are trying to do, what your preferences are, what your needs are, that the market is indifferent to",

So that's the context of that video. I actually didn't even really talk much about market makers in there, but I think that's why they added the market makers in there because they're bundling them in that broader market concept. And it says the system is set up for the 1. There is no oversight. Congress trades on insider info for fuck's sake, SEC and FBI turn a blind eye when the buy button was turned off in GameStop in 2021. So the first thing is I want to start with the way that I look at things. There's a lot of emotion and understandably so in this comment. I fully understand why they're so emotional and why that's coming through in this comment. But here's the reality. Market makers, they're not out to hurt retail traders. Now market makers are absolutely out to make as much money as they possibly can. Now the difference there might sound like there is no difference, but there is a difference there and it's subtle. There's a big difference between a system that incentivizes different behaviors to make as much money as humanly possible, which is what they do versus doing",

There's a big difference between a system that incentivizes different behaviors to make as much money as humanly possible, which is what they do versus doing things to hurt an entity. The reason why I'm flagging this difference is because this develops a victim mindset. If we go into this thinking that people are purposefully trying to poach us that are trying to hurt us that are trying to say how can I fuck up this person over here? It completely skews our perception of the game that we're playing. So the reality is the market in general simply is indifferent to you. That indifference can absolutely result in you having trades that lose or your PL going down. Yeah, that indifference is a thing because it's a competitive space. People are trying to make money. Then you overlay some of the fuckery that we clearly can see in GameStop and not just GameStop in other stocks with naked shorting and FTDs. And the fact that they're playing the plumbing of the system, again, they're playing the plumbing of the system not to hurt retail traders outright. It's because they can make more money doing so. So it's an incentive-based structure. There isn't an incentive for them to hurt any entity. And when I say her, obviously, it won't be in physical, but I mean in",

The way that the system is incentivized is literally to play the game within the bounds as best as you can to make as much money as you possibly can. And that actually goes into this here. Congress trading on insider information. Here's the reality. What Congress does as far as their trading is perfectly legal. It's not insider trading. It's perfectly legal. I want to be super clear. I couldn't disagree with it anymore if possible. The fact when you're in professional services jobs as a peasant, right? Like if you're a consultant at a consulting firm, there's really strict requirements on what you can trade. And as a consultant, you don't see shit. The only thing you're doing, the only thing you're doing is moving shit on a slide deck around and making sure everything is perfect. That's it, bro. That is it.

It, to me, it's a fucking no brainer thing to be gone. But it's not illegal. So tying it to insider info, which is illegal is again, just kind of crossing streams a little bit. And this is what happens when we start to view the entire system is stacked against us. We look at everything through the lens of how, well, how is this designed to screw me over? And again, I'm not saying that it's not, I'm not saying that there are disadvantages. There are. But it's not quite as adversarial to that degree. Now again, in terms of the system set up for the 1. I actually, like, I was actually just talking with my wife about this. One of the things I think about is why is it that if you're trying to contribute to IRA, you can contribute 7,000.

Now, one of the other things with respect to congressional trading, there's a few things in mind. Now, again, I want to be really clear. I think first and foremost, they, if they're to put on any positions, they should only be able to put on ETFs, right? That standard most places abide by that kind of rule where anybody has any sort of insider level information. So definitely the case. Now, there's another reality, though. And it's, again, it's up for a conversation. It depends on your belief systems and what you think. But if you look at, let's look at a few things. So, I don't know about, I don't really care about that. For all members of the House of Representatives and Senate, they're getting 174,000. The majority party leader is 193, minorities 193, so on and so forth. So, they're not making bad money, but they're not making great money.

And if they were to work in a corporate equivalent, they could make way more money. But a lot of them venture into government. I honestly don't believe for altruistic reasons. But taking this back to the trading thing, part of it is trying to set up an incentive structure so that smart people that have better alternatives to make more money elsewhere still want to do the job. And I'm not saying that this is right. And I'm not saying that they should trade. They shouldn't. I'm just offering that as a thought process for the broader problem that exists here.

So again, to be super clear, I don't think they should be able to trade. I don't. I think it's crazy that they can trade individual names. I think it's fucked. But I do think that this highlights one of the underlying incentives and why they still are able to they can close that hole pretty quick if they were so inclined. But what ends up happening is a couple of people rally together. I know AOC is one of them and another, a couple of other people banded together was actually bipartisan. It was a Republican and a Democrat that were like, yeah, this is why why can Congress trade like this is absolutely ridiculous. And somehow those bills never go anywhere. There's never any law passed on that. And it highlights some of again, the incentive structure. So that the main takeaway is I think looking at their ability to trade individual stocks, I agree. It's crazy. But I think to look at really complex problems in a really simplistic lens and just say, you know, they shouldn't be able to do that. Then you really have to think",

But I think to look at really complex problems in a really simplistic lens and just say, you know, they shouldn't be able to do that. Then you really have to think about what the compensation and stuff like that should be to have like actually genuinely qualified people in there to do a good job. So really, really tricky tricky problem set. I think that there's no world that they should be able to trade individual names like that's absolutely crazy. So and then he says SEC and FBI turned a blind eye when the buy button was turned off. And again, like the SEC didn't turn a blind eye. They didn't investigation. Now, even for that investigation, I don't agree with the investigation. But like their outcome, but they did look at it. Now again, how just how fair how accurate. That's different. And I think that there's a conversation to be had there. But yeah. And the other thing is the turning a blind eye is really interesting. And culpabilities also very interesting in that scenario. That that would be a really interesting thing to dive into at some point. But Lawrence is Trump slings coin and dem slings stocks. They all kind of suck. I completely agree. And it's not just Dems. By the way, that's slings stocks. It's Republicans too. You can see them all. You can",

And I've added them to a watch list because it would not be all too shocking if they magically did well. But here's the other thing. And again, I enjoy making the jokes as much as anybody else. But I also understand the reality of things. Right. We make jokes about Nancy Pelosi and how Nancy Pelosi is putting on these crazy trades and her portfolios doing really well. Like let's actually take a look at it really quick. Because you'll see you'll see a quiver quant. They do a good job here. So quiver quant has a look at Pelosi's portfolio. Right. And you can see that she's done a great job. She's had a overall from what is it 16 May of 2014 is 778 percent returned versus the spy at 219. It's a great return.

So I'm grabbing Paul's details. The only reason I'm saying this stuff is because again, sometimes people get a little too myopic with respect to like, you know, just like a joke. And we forget the lens of things. But let's take a look. So he founded and runs the venture capital firm financial leasing services, which he and his wife had a personal fortune. About 1114, they invested in Oakland invaders. Oakland invaders actually don't know what is that. I had never heard of that before. I'm not really familiar with American football. So I don't really know much. I thought it was like the Oakland Raiders or something. But anyways, within the US football league. Okay. So it's got to be something completely different than. Oh, is this soccer? Whatever. He purchased a franchise and then Pelosi's success in stock trading attracted media attention of 2021. So the dude's an investor, right?

Like all of that is completely okay to talk about. But it's just important to note, this isn't Nancy Pelosi slaying trades. This is actually her husband who is an investor. And then the other thing that's really important to layer on top of that. If we look at most of these positions, they're just leveraged long tech. Well, no shit, leveraged long tech has worked tremendously well over the last decade. And it's a no brainer of a position. So if you look at just QQQ, the index itself. And we go out over the last 10 years. Pretty good. 84 up to 540. Right. So all I'm saying is it's not like they're in there with like these really nuanced names and buy in really short term and swing and stuff based on some sort of news that just came out and they're playing the rise and then dumping out and getting out going all the way back. I don't think they should be able to trade. I'm reiterating that point because when I talk about this stuff, some people start to get really defensive and they think that like I'm justifying what",

But I'm trying to add context to people because we lose the ability to objectively evaluate stuff. And we start to paint this picture like Nancy Pelosi is personally on there making a bunch of trades based on insider information that only she knows. And she's profiting off of it. The reality is the majority of their returns come from leveraged long positions via deep in the money leaps in tech stocks. Amazon, Google, Nvidia, Vista Strat, Apple, like there's not a lot of magic going on here. Now I still prefer to be able to play the game and just pretend that Nancy Pelosi is slaying in trades because I think it's hilarious. But as I make those jokes, I understand the broader context behind it. So all that stuff aside, time, actually, we have to update. We haven't done this in a while. The eight map.

Oh, I think we had maybe we had you already. You might be calling in from Capis, Cillet, hell of a name. All right, let's figure out let's figure out where we're at in this D.D. library. Let's sort it by date. And then I think we did this one. And I think this is where we are now. The bigger short. Let's zoom in. Oh, damn. All right, let's see.

It was canned, kicked in the same people who caused the crash. Still have been running rampant. I mean, it's not really true to be honest. Because the market continues to be unregulated. You're profiting off of short-term gains at the risk of killing their institutions and the global economy. Only this time it's much, much worse. So this is the problem I have with stuff like this to be honest is the the doom and gloom lens is always in vogue. Right. It's always look at somebody like Michael Burry. Michael Burry is built an entire following around essentially his really significant play that actually was so poorly timed that he almost had to close the doors to his fund. And it worked. So the timing obviously wasn't that bad. But we look past those parts and we forget the reality behind it. And Burry has had a lot of stuff on Twitter in the Natsudistan past worries, you know, talking about sell. The crash is coming.

Like their original perspective of that the crash is still underway. It's kind of like well, then when does it happen if it's tied to this? And supposedly now it's much, much worse. But the other thing just to reiterate here is that the markets are regulated. And they're not doing the same thing in the derivative markets that they were before. What happened in O A obviously had to do with credit default swaps and the bundling of mortgage-backed securities. And again, it was completely, completely insane what they were doing. They were overlavered and stuff like that, not defending them. But it's just that that was heavily regulated post that move. So just again, something to be aware of. So the bankers abuse smaller amounts of leverage for the O A bubble and have since abused much higher. Now there is higher aggregate leverage. I actually agree with that. COVID came in, rocked the economy to the point where the Fed is now pinned between a rock in a hard place in order to buy more time. They triggered a flurry of protective measures. Yeah.

And they said, even during 2008, a lot of them did really well the firms and post 2008, but they actually had to stop doing their Christmas parties. Because they used to have these really big extravagant Christmas parties, and they knew that the optics on that were terrible. That people are losing their houses during 2008, and the banks were doing really well. So they literally stopped doing their Christmas parties because of that, which is really interesting. So this is about the credit default swaps. So this is all about their perception and their understanding of the crash of, oh, eight, which is fine. I think we know most of the details on that.

And it's essentially saying this is allowing them to bid against a wide range of credit CDOs or other entities buying at a cheaper rate. They can now bet against a wide range of failures in any market. And they were lying upwards of 25 discounts. Well, this is also going to provide a stabilization effect, though, which is one of the reasons why there's an incentive behind it. GameStop was never going to cause the market to crash. This is interesting. Let's see what they say. GameStop was meant to die off the rich bet against it. Many folds over and it was on the brink of bankruptcy before many conditions led to where it is today completely cracked. That's exactly what happened. As far as I could tell, it was in the middle of being seller boxed down to bankruptcy. It was never going to cause the market crash. And it will and it never will cause the crash.

The short squeeze is a result of high abuse of the derivatives market over the past decade where we're all streets abuse of this market as prime the economy for another market crash of their own. I agree with the abuse of the derivatives market and the overall risk there, but we've seen some really smart people, especially like CEO, what was it of IB talking about it. I think that this is underselling the potential that GameStop could have had on actually, like, genuinely starting a broad scale might not be full crash. It could have been a full crash. We don't really know. But I do think that there's a little bit more power behind it than what this might be alluding to. GameStop was a non-issue in the market. Let's see. Failure of 1 how GameStop can deal a fatal blow to wealth inequality. Jesus. So one of the things that I don't like with stuff like this is it's creating such an us versus them mentality and it's just broad, bucketing people together, which is almost always an ignorant perspective. So to something like this, say, the failure of the 1 how they can deal a fatal blow to wealth inequality. The 1 that's not a small group of people. There's a lot of people",

So to summarize essentially all of them into the same bucket is very frequently just a illogical conclusion to come to, which again is worth noting. I think if we're going to have accusations in a cost entities, we should be very specific. We shouldn't say the 1. It's a very broad generalization and it's kind of reckless to do something like that. Actually, let's see real quick. What considers, I'm probably in that. Let me see. What is considered the top 1 in the US? I accidentally did you a one sec. What is considered the top 1 in the US? Typically defined by income and net worth, being in the top 1 of earners worldwide, household generally needs an annual income of 787,000. Yeah. 2024 report by night Frank indicates an individual requires a net worth of 5.8 million to be in the top 1. Other analysts suggest that threshold might be higher around 11.6 million. That's a big gap. But there's a lot of people in that. And based on some of those, I'm also in that. So the thing is, there's a lot of people in this.

Because we have some very specific areas to point at, not kind of a lazy generalization. But anyways, let's continue. One person, the short interest was 140, which we've done a bunch of DD on that. We know that it was even higher than that at points. And it's insane, right? The fact that larger than the float is short, it is complete fucking bullshit. There's no world where that should be even remotely possible. And a lot of that has to also do with the phantom shares that we were talking about. So this is a great call out. Maybe it was 200 back then, 480 who knows. So essentially, and I agree with the point they're making gear to the fact that the number literally was bullshit. Once you see it over 100, it's all fucking fake. And it's really difficult to tell how many fake shares are out there and leading to all these fake proxies. So I agree with this.

You can hopefully gather that Wall Street takes on massive risks all the time. They do not care as long as it turns out short term profits. Now, again, this is also, I think, a mistake and a mischaracterization. Wall Street really obviously cares about short term profits, but they're not thinking of how do I make a buck this month? They're strategic thinking and they're thinking of industry trends that are going to unfold over the next decade to sell them short and undermine their overall intelligence to just myopic focus on short term profits is a mischaracterization of them wholly. And again, it's the same thing in the military. One of the most dangerous things you can do in the military is underestimate your enemy. A lot of times, that's how you get dead. So this, I believe, is underestimating the total prowess of Wall Street, quote unquote, which is obviously a big grouping, another broad generalization. But in this case, I understand their general point. They're not over archingly focused on short term profits. They're dynasties. They're thinking quite longer term. This way, Paul says fatal blow to wealth inequality. Yeah, completely agreed.

And that's a much broader topic than for this stream. But like a lot of things like that, it's heavily complex. So the one thing I always try to remind people of is we talk as we even, you know, passively discuss these really big topics like that is our really simple explanations and desires for stuff like this tend to fall woefully short of just how much goes into the problem itself. It's very complex. So the conditions that led to GameStopward is today is a miracle itself. I agree. The support of retail traders has led to explosive fatal mistake of the rich. Again, another really big characterization that I don't like because a short position has infinite loss potential, which is true but not true. And the reason why I tell people it's true but not true is the reason why it's not infinite sooner or later, you literally consume all available resources. And I know it's a dramatic example, but there's a difference between that and infinite. It's not actually infinite.

It's not a fighting in Smell of Incident L. .72. It's a battle against the entire financial world that's pretty significant. There's speculation from multiple people that the Fed is going to be complicit right now helping suppress GameStop. That's another pretty significant accusation. Don't you think they'd fight tooth and nail to suppress this and try to get everyone to sell? Now, this goes back to another current state deviation from this that I do think is also worth pointing out. And the current state deviation being with the offerings and GameStop shares being less scarce.

So let's, anyways, finish this and see if maybe there's a big connecting dot here. Regardless of the other rules that look good for Moas, I see them in a negative light. They're passing others to prevent a game, game stop situation from ever occurring again. They realize how much power retail could have from pying in a short squeeze play. These new rules snap new emerging short squeezes instantly. If the conditions of a short squeeze ever occur again, there will never be a GameStop situation after this. Well, this wasn't true. There was a situation this year. It's their game after all. They've been abusing the derivative market that. The rich again, broad generalization, are now at risk of losing that money and insane amounts of cash that they've accumulated over the year, the housing market of OA.

The rich again, broad generalization, are now at risk of losing that money and insane amounts of cash that they've accumulated over the year, the housing market of OA. Yeah, I mean, okay, so let's just do quick pros and cons. Pros, I really liked the historical overview of the 2008 crash. I think that there's a lot to learn from that. I also think that there's a good amount of discussion around various derivative products, the cons a lot of the main premises they break down and it just becomes a lot of speculation and then it becomes a lot of rooting in us versus them. I think as much as we can keep things quantitative, qualitative, I won't be reporting out like this, the better off we are because then it's not a game of I feel blank is unfair or I don't like this or I don't like that and it literally becomes a game of pointing at things like we can with naked shorts, for example, like we can quantitatively point at the short float being at 140 and be like, what the fuck? There's a hundred percent of the stock. You're telling me 140 of it is shorted, make that make sense. That's a great data point to point at and to pull out and extrapolate some of the broader themes that they're talking about, like the manipulation and whatnot. But yeah, okay,",

Can anybody give me the context behind this one? Help. H-A-L-P. I love front butts. I don't think you do. I don't think anybody likes front butts. Then it's bad news. Why is GameStop traded overnight and AMC is not? Is that the case? I'm just looking them up really quick. Let me see. Okay. We know that GameStop does obviously, but I'm curious about. I mean, it looks like AMC does trade after hours. Here. So the reason why you might not see it is it could just be because it's really low volume. But it does look like it trades after hours as far as I can see. And it looks like we don't know this meme. Got it. Haggis says, what about making all short positions public? What's your opinion?

And then the SEC essentially will combine them. I think that's good. I like that a lot, but I don't think every firm needs to publicly show every single position it has. That starts to create a little bit, well, perpetually, I should say, it starts to make it really difficult for the firms essentially to do their job because they're playing a lot of games against one another. And that information could become difficult to manage. That's one of the advents of Darkpools, which Darkpools are now being abused. The whole origin of a Darkpool was actually a very reasonable idea. And it's because we would essentially see we would essentially see entities front running big block trades. And then they couldn't get a actual trade through without being ran up massively. So Darkpools were built originally to fix that. But like I said, they definitely are being abused for sure.

I appreciate that quite a lot. And then the house of cards obviously, but we've already seen that one. So I'm curious how much in here actually is going to be DD versus just kind of playing games. There's a lot to go through for sure, but if a lot of it is like memes and stuff like that, we'll probably roll through it pretty fast, I think. So awesome.
