So the goal for this session I have for us right now is to take a much closer look at the end-to-end process of building a trade. So excuse me, we got a bunch of Celterwater. Right now we're doing, what is this one? Strawberry watermelon, this one's pretty good. I like this one. I guess I'm just on a watermelon vibe because my backup one is just regular watermelon. We go through Celterwater here pretty much perpetually. Tons of it. As for always, I'd say hello to who we have. Hang in out. I'm C. Jim Pollo, J. and Elon's songs. Great to see all of you. And let's do a quick overview of what this is going to look like. So so far with this entire options trading segment for beginners, we've gone through a lot of different things. And I want to talk about the broad context first. We're not going through this whole deck, but I just want to talk to you about a couple pieces. So here's the deal. There's a bunch of things that go into trading options. First, we need to understand the economy to a degree, the stock market. We need to understand how options behave, the fundamentals behind options. And then we have to start getting to a point where we're pulling together",

We need to understand how options behave, the fundamentals behind options. And then we have to start getting to a point where we're pulling together this information into a comprehensive, I guess deployment of them. You have to pull a lot of things together to make this whole thing work. So the goal behind this is to spend a little bit of time going through what that looks like, what the actual process is to come up with an idea and then to start trading it. Because over the course of a trading career, it very infrequently, some people, they do hit these one-off wonders that change their entire lives straight from the jump. And then that's essentially what they're using for their primary wealth going forward, meaning essentially hitting the trading lottery is what that's equivalent to. But for most of us, it's not like that. Most of us, it is a long process, and for some of us, at least like me, I want it to be a long process. Not so much I'd love to have dozens of millions of dollars right now. That would be pretty sick. But I think I also enjoy markets in the process of trading. It's very engaging and it's one of the coolest ways, genuinely, that I have found to learn about the world around us.",

So that is in a nutshell, what I want to spend most of our time on today is working through this broader context of how to essentially build a trading plan and how we can find ideas, build strategies. So taking a quick step back from that, though, with all of the stuff that we've talked about so far, there's been a lot of details. So I do want to offer an opportunity if there are any specific questions or if there's any specific topics that we've covered up to this point that you want to talk about. And I am happy to start there, do a quick catch up. And it looks like we had a couple more people popping in, I see doku doku doki. That's a fun name. Pat Hader, Jim Reese, Ruda Bega, bean gaming, that's a fun one. Pat says not to be that guy, but saw RKDFV type options by 719 Siri. We could do that towards the end. Yeah, I have no problem taking a peek at that, but I want to keep the beginning session a little more focused on the fundamentals. I also think it's really difficult to actually identify like",

So it could be him, it could not be him, I haven't looked at Siri at all. I have no idea at this point. I looked at it last weekend, but happy to either take a look at it later today and see what we can maybe piece together. Ben Waz here, fly high and enjoy, that's a fun one. And then Jaden, sweep. All right, so I'm not seeing a bunch of catch up questions. So I think that that means that we can get more into, ah, there we go, Reese, perfect timing. Daniel, good to see you as well. Reese says how important is margin? It's a great question. And in terms of importance, margin is what I would consider to be a force multiplier. So Reese, what you're talking about there, there's two different things. There's trading with margin, trading on margin. However you want to phrase it, there's kind of different utilization of margin. And options utilize a specific type where we're not actually borrowing money. So let's take a look at an example. If we take a",

And options utilize a specific type where we're not actually borrowing money. So let's take a look at an example. If we take a look, maybe at spy. And we take a look at the options in spy. Here is a nutshell of trading with margin. If I want to open and let's say I want to sell a put, it's a cash secured put. So if you don't remember, a cash secured put is where you sell a put option. And you're putting up the capital to cover the options position. So in this case, that means that you would have to buy 100 shares of spy at 5.52. So if you're to cash secure the position, it's 55,200. That's if you want to essentially cash the position. Now, if I go to actually put this trade on, and again, this is in a pass through account for me. So I don't have any positions on in here. But I think this one is standard margin. If I'm not mistaken, we'll see. If we sell a put, let's see what this asks of me. Just this. Yeah, so this is for this is a pass through retirement account. So the margin required here essentially is full margin. It wants, so this isn't using really any leverage at all. That's like an example of",

Let me get me out of the way. I'll go top right. And if you take a look at the margin required for this trade now, that we are outside of a retirement account, which requires essentially posting the full trading capital for the position in that example, you'll notice that the margin requirement for the position is only 16,800. So what that means is the broker is saying, this position, it knows what this position is worth in its entirety. The broker knows the reason why it's moving, by the way, is because this is on demand. I don't want you guys thinking something squarely is going on after hours. It's not. But so what this is saying is in this example now, the broker requires 17,300. So even though this position is controlling 55,000 of spy, the broker is only asking for 17,300. So you're not actually borrowing any money from the broker and you very well might have the 55,000 to cash secure this position. But in this world of trading options, you're",

So you're not actually borrowing any money from the broker and you very well might have the 55,000 to cash secure this position. But in this world of trading options, you're not borrowing money. Your broker is just not requiring you to set aside the maximum value of a position. They're asking for what we would call a margin requirement, which is just a smaller subset of the total value of that position. And once that's satisfied, then the broker is chill. They have what they need to cover their risk. It's important to know that margin moves. So as the market goes up and goes down, as the broker perceives their risk moving, your margin requirement will also change. It's not a static figure. So margin is important for a few reasons. It's the primary modality that leverage is afforded to you in options. So let's give another example not using puts now. And let's take a look at calls. So in this example, if I wanted to buy these calls here, the 551, I just picked a random one. Right now, these are at a 70. So if you'll remember, every single options contract moves in 100 share lots. So this is a one lot, and it comprises up to 100 shares. Essentially, with this being a 70 delta, that means that this position currently is behaving similarly to",

Essentially, with this being a 70 delta, that means that this position currently is behaving similarly to 70 shares of spy. So if we were to buy 70 shares at, let's just use the strike price, for example, which in this case is 551 times 70, 38,570 bucks. That's what it would cost. If you were to buy the share equivalent of this position, you have to put up 38,570. However, if you were to buy the option, it costs 1,531. So again, you're not borrowing money here, but this is the leverage afforded to you through options. So there's a difference to recap between trading on margin or trading with margin. When you are on margin, you are borrowing money actively, and you have to pay a rate to borrow the money. If you're trading with margin, which all options positions do, in that instance, you're essentially benefiting from the leverage provided to you, but you're not actually borrowing any money. Reese says, if you don't have cash in your account, can you specify you want to sell a cash secured put and unmargin' and not cash secured? If you do have the cash, it's a great question.

So Reese, the follow up to your question and for anybody else wondering what we're talking about now, Reese is asking, can you tell your broker if you want to sell your cash secured put on margin and not cash secured? The broker is going to default to unmargin. So if I have a marginable account, again, this is a pass through IRA, so it automatically requires full cash secured. So if I go into on demand and we look at this position, what day are we? I'm actually just curious what this is. Oh, this is looking at the first of July, this month, cool. I don't know why I find that cool, but I do. So if we're to look at this fake trade, the, let me, might still out of the way, yeah, okay, I'm still top right good. So if we're a little look at this fake trade, the margin requirement to put this trade on is 15,477. That's the default. So if you have a marginable account, the broker, depending on the permissions you have, I should clarify, because there's different levels of options permissions. So if you have like the highest tier, I honestly don't even know what they go up to anymore or what those actually look like, and I just",

I just realized this thing like totally cut my head off. There we go. There we go. I think we're getting back at it, team. I think we're getting back at it. All right. How did the back of the computer look like by the way? I had to like reroute the cable really fast. Back to the question though, the broker will automatically essentially just use the margin requirement for the position. They do not care if you want to cash secure it, you would have to notify them yourself that you want to cash secure the position. That's essentially how it would work. So the beautiful part about that is the broker is automatically giving you the benefit of the doubt. The negative side to that is then you have to have good accounting if you're looking to track cash secured positions versus non. The broker doesn't do that for you automatically. So Reese, let me know if that answers your question. Ruda Bega says, how do you tell if an option is currently cheaper, expensive to buy? That's another great question.

So there's a couple of things you can do to look at that. So let's take a look at, let's find a random stock, something that we don't know much about. I'm just gonna go into this scan and pick something. Walmart, most of us know about Walmart. I don't really know what's going on in here. We'll get a sense of it. And let me zoom us out to like a six-month daily, something like that. And, Reese says, thanks so much, Margin's son of like running up a credit card and as a fellow poor kid, always seemed like a trap to me. It's actually hilarious, you say that, because I always struggled massively with the concept of borrowing money from a broker to put on more trades, like that kind of leverage terrified me.

There's a couple things that I will look for. And the goal is to figure out how expensive these options are. So what can we do to figure that out? We can start with a broad assessment, which is what we're gonna start with. And then we can get more into specifics. Pat says, oh, I, it's a great idea, but that's not correct. Oh, I, which is an option's open interest, that's not actually gonna tell us if something is expensive or not. Benoit and Reese are on it as well as Eddie. Both of those groups are on it. So you guys are right on top of it. Peter says implied volatility, which is good. What a hell of a name. I am now the biggest fan of this new name, which is overmoicin' meatloaf. It's fantastic. Is the golden shower crossover? No, that, you know, I tell you what, that sounds like a hell of a crossover though, but that sounds also like a crossover between trading and some other endeavors.

So Reese is saying versus HV, I would delete that part Reese because that doesn't help you. The first answer of IV is much closer to being correct. So let's take a look at it. If we go back to our options pricing model, I started building this deck for you guys, which is funny because I never use slides. I don't like them very much, especially for my time as a consultant with Deloitte. I don't really like to spend a lot of time in them, but this thing is starting to become a bear. I'm using it to kind of have all of the stuff we need in one single spot. So anyways, if we go back somewhere in here, we have pricing models here. So when we look at an option pricing model, and let me maybe make this bold, maybe underlines, what's a little easier to see, there's a very important input, which you could tell I have highlighted, which is volatility, because all of these things are kind of known and they're",

    "text": "So when we look at an option pricing model, and let me maybe make this bold, maybe underlines, what's a little easier to see, there's a very important input, which you could tell I have highlighted, which is volatility, because all of these things are kind of known and they're relative to the underlying at a point in time. If we're assessing, if an option is expensive, this is what we care about, volatility. This is the primary input that will change beyond other kind of known standard effects, how relatively expensive an option is. So if we move this over here, and let's take a look first at the implied volatility. So for Walmart, the implied volatility is up here, 26.24. Is that expensive? Is it cheap? We don't really know. That's why I frame it that way. It's just a number. Implied volatility in this sense is just telling us the expectation of price movement. That's all. So we can't really tell, we can't decipher from this. If that means that the options are cheaper expensive, we don't know yet. What we can use is something like implied volatility percentile or implied volatility rank. I much prefer implied volatility percentile. It is much less prone to skew. And I think that that matters. So going off of that thread, and I think in here actually, if I'm not mistaken, we have something in here about implied volatility percentile. Valtuity. Yeah, here we go. Oh, look at, see, I",

Oh, look at, see, I told you, this thing is becoming like the ultimate reference guide for most things. So here, I'm showing you the difference between implied volatility percentile calculation and implied volatility rank. The problem with implied volatility rank is based on the way that it's calculated. It is very prone to remaining skewed when there's a really large move. IV percentile is much less prone to skew. Because what we're doing is we're taking the current implied volatility and we're seeing how high it is relative to a reference timeframe.

Even on a, on like a broad basis, Benoit says there's gotta be an extension to auto dismissals. I bet the problem with that extension though is it probably also tracks every single personal detail that I have, which is not worth me not, at least making a small comment about the thing when it pops up.

This is what I do. So any chance to talk about options with somebody else that even potentially gets turned on by them, I'm here for it. So back to this implied volatility on a gross level, if it's high, the options are gonna be more expensive. So if IV in this thing is let's say 15 then if that's compared to something with IV that is 54, the 54 IV options are absolutely going to be more expensive. Now, when you're comparing within an individual product, so in this case, we're looking at Tesla, if we compare the price of Tesla relative to itself, this means that the implied volatility percentile gives us that metric and it lets us know how expensive IV is relative to just Tesla. And in this case, the options would be relatively expensive in general. We're still in the macro view, the higher level view. So quick recap. If IV is high, in general, as a gross figure, cross products options become more expensive. Implied volatility percentile gives us a relative understanding of a product's IV relative to itself. If",

If implied volatility percentile is high, then its options are correspondingly going to be more expensive. That's the macro level view. Now to get into the micro level view, I guess we'll just use Tesla to keep the example going. Wow, and it's even better now. Check this out. IVP is 98. This is actually kind of a cool example. Let's bring this back over real fast. So in this timeframe when I looked at it, IV was 54 with IVP of 58. Now it's 68.4 with IVP of 98. So now options are really expensive on a relative basis. Interesting. So if we come in here, and we take a look at the options, let's go first at the expiration cycles. So this is, and if you've been watching any of the GME videos I've been doing, which again, even if you're not necessarily super into the GME story as I am, obviously, there's still a lot of really good information about options, analysis, and general in there.

It's like 10 minutes and I'm launching almost one a day at this rate. But one of the things you've seen me look at in a lot of them is this. This is the implied volatility for each expiration cycle. So we can see, for example, that this 12 July, which was today, had 81.66 vol. The expiration cycle for 19 July is down to 63.62, but then the next expiration cycle is back up to 83.55. So what can we infer from here, that these options, this chain on a relative basis to the product, and specifically to these other options chains is cheaper. So this is another click down on assessing the expansiveness of an option. So we now know the macro picture from the underlying itself. We now know based on expiration cycles where I can find cheaper options. So in this case, we see these options out here are 60.09. They're relatively cheap. I think I clicked the, yeah, I got the right one. So now there's one final layer we can click into, which is the individual option. You can find where options are relatively cheap or more expensive. Now what you'll find first is typically speaking, the IV will expand as you go further out and in the money. So generally speaking, there will",

Now what you'll find first is typically speaking, the IV will expand as you go further out and in the money. So generally speaking, there will be cheaper volatility at the money. So with this, you can look for slight anomalies and see if there's a period where you can go a little further out in time and actually find cheaper IV, like this one right here. So as I look at this 25 delta put, notice how the volatility leading into that put, I see 56 and a quarter of 56.21 and then 56.18 and then it bounces back up to 56.32. So these are relatively cheap in this product where the expiration cycle writ large is looking at 60 vol, you can find 56, I'm sorry, 60 vol, you can find 56.18 vol. So this is where volatility is cheaper. So a bit of a long answer, but I wanted to give you guys a bunch of different ways of looking at this. So let me see. Reese says seems odd to have less vol and longer dated expiration, the high IV of September should appear in October. No, not necessarily. It's all based on expectations. The other tool that you have is this. And we can look at the implied volatility for either the average of the options. Let me get rid of",

And all these crazy lines being all kinked like this is actually that's a ton of trading opportunities from a Vol trader's perspective, especially this blue one. That 19 July, that's nuts. If you guys heard a 19 July, that's super tradable. All that's super tradable. There's relative values there, but I don't want to get too far in the weeds there. I just caught my eye. So you can look at the relative cheapness or expansiveness of maybe out the money options versus in the money options. You can look at relative pricing. But this is more for a different style of trading. I just want you to know it exists. But what you're looking here is a volatility surface. It's not as pretty as the 3D models, but it gives you the same information. And like seeing things that include crossovers, like this 19 July to 26 July, I can see that pretty clear as day. So if I clear everything out and just show you those, this right here, that's a tradable event. This entire thing is a tradable event. So there's a lot of different opportunities with trading",

So give me a random ticker, and then I will run through this whole process because I know that that seems like a lot, but it takes less than two minutes. So if you give me a random ticker, something not that we look at all the time, I will pull it up and then I will assess the options for you real time. SMCI game. Let's take a look at SMCI. SMCI. All right, so the first thing I notice is we are trending sideways. So the reason why that matters to me is because if we have big drops in price, I inherently know volatility tends to be higher. So I scout's honor, I haven't looked at the top corner yet, but when I look at this, I see something that went through a drop and has been trending sideways. So I would expect volatility to be low, however it is earnings coming up. So my expectation of vol in that case would be actually much higher. So IVP 71, so that doesn't surprise me.

So what I'm doing is quickly using the chart to get a sense of how price is moving that will inform a little bit of where how volatile or how expensive options can be. Now I looked at IVP. The other thing I notice is IV and this is 88. On a gross amount that is a relatively high number. If I give you a comparison really quick, like GE, 38. And look at this, the IV and GE is 38, the IV percentile is 97. So what this is telling you in GE, even though IV is only 38, that's crazy expensive for what this is on a relative basis. Okay, so back to SMCI. First thing, price down tells me vol typically a little bit higher. Trending sideways would tell me vol probably contracting. Earnings coming up, tells me vol probably higher. Now I can skip all of that. I'm just walking through my actual thought process out loud. Now I look at IV, 88 gross number is high, tells me expensive. IVP 71, tells me expensive.

These options in this expiration cycle being this low, relative to the others, same with the 68. These tell me these two on a relative basis are quite cheap. So if I wanted to buy options, I might look at something a little further out, and then you have to go into liquidity and all that shit. But I'm just letting you know from IV perspective, I can see what's expensive versus what's not. Like this in here is expensive. It's essentially the top end of the options chain. So depending on what kind of trade I'm looking to put on, I either might want them to be expensive or I might want them to be cheap. Depending on what scenario I would either go there or here. So now going out here to the 20 December, and a quick assessment of the options, I see that there's actually very, very slight call skew in terms of vol.

So what I'm doing now is I'm comparing the same delta options. I see a 31 delta put here, and I see a 31 delta call way out here. The 31 delta call has 75.6 vol. The 31 delta put has 72.99. Very often you'll see the inverse. The market tends to price in the downside way more heavily than the upside, but when you're looking at individual tickers like this, or even if you've been following what I've been looking at with GameStop, they tend to be skewed actually quite a lot. So if I now have a pretty comprehensive picture of how expensive volatility is. So let me know specifically, I think Reese, that was originally your question. Let me know if that answers your question. I hope that going through that exercise is useful for you. Let me take a quick look at some of these other questions.

How do you identify the delta of a contract when you are swapping only fans pages in the open up market? That confused me. But I would probably direct most of your attention to the only fans pages and not worry so much about the delta. That would be my guess. Ben Wallace says, what is expensive really mean here?

Like that's at the end of the day when you're trading options, you're trading ball to some degree or to another. That's really, you're seeing how expensive the ball is that you're transacting at. That's the easiest way to think about it. Carlos says, what platform? This is Thinkors Swim. I still find that so novel that so many people aren't really used to looking at Thinkors Swim.

It's just because obviously it's telling me that I'm becoming an old head at my right page of 33 because when I look at like primary trading platforms, this is so popular, but I guess most people are used to using stuff like Robinhood now in Wee Bowl. Very interesting. Ben Wallace says, so the price per expected tick change, I wouldn't even think of it as in terms of expected tick change. It's okay to look at that, right? Because that's what Delta's telling you. It's literally just telling you how expensive the balls are that you're trading. That's essentially it. Rolando says, but if you do a little TA, you can see that a chart is really looking, oh, I think I missed, oh, I have to go back up. Rolando says, I have a question. Why did you sell your options today? I understand your strategy is more conservative and you swing trading. But if you do a little TA, you can see the chart is looking really good for next week. Mac, D cross. Yeah, so a couple of things. And he's referring to the GME trade. I still have a position on, as I said, like I still have right now.

I still have long shares and I do have options in it still. I just wasn't able to establish the position I wanted out here in 18 October. I have exposure now in 20 September. So the only thing I did was take in my 16 augs and the reason for that is because they're starting to get to a point where on a relative basis on the remaining value of the options, it's going to decay much faster. So it means that I need bigger moves in order for this to stay essentially where I want. So I had a pretty decent price accommodation from where I entered the trade. It's for me, like I said in the video, like I'm a trader, right? And my job is to make money. So I look at something that is made money. It's slowing down, it's up move. And I do have kind of the rest of the exposure that I want at the time. So yeah, that's literally exactly why. What you don't want to do with options is wait too long, especially if you're buying them. If you're buying options, it's really, really difficult to strike a balance in terms of an expected return, which we can talk about that a little bit.

But it's important to remember that you literally are holding a decaying asset, right? It's something that's disappearing in your hands. And if you hold on to it for too long, you lose a decent amount of the value. Even though I tend to go in the money, there's still extrinsic value in those options that's decaying away. So for example, if we go out here to the 20 steps, you can see that even really high delta options, let's use something like this, the 20s, they're, you know, bid 730 offered at eight. But of that, you know, whatever, seven and a half or three, I don't know where you would get filled in here. I noticed that the markets tend to be pretty liquid, meaning you're not going to get hit at the mid, especially if you're buying. You're probably going to be a little more offer heavy. That's what I've noticed at least. And in that, if I'm looking to gain exposure to GameStop and I'm buying calls, let's say I take them in for seven 80, something like that. And of that seven 80, at least a dollar 20 or so is extrinsic value that's going, that's bleeding out of the position. So that",

So that means as time is passing, this is slowly coming out of my, that's adding drag to my returns. So that means I need GameStop to move more to compensate for what I'm losing on Theta2K. That starts to accelerate as you're closer in time. I actually have neat little, again, I told you, like this thing is becoming like the, everything reference. What that is showing you though is this, as we start getting within 60 days on a relative basis, Theta2K really accelerates as extrinsic value approximates to zero as we get nearer the expiration. So that is in a nutshell why I adjusted the position I did. So if there's any follow on questions to that, let me know. Bryce asked, have a question about GME options. So let's say the market has a huge squeeze to the upside next week and the option is for October, wouldn't this create difficulty for selling since it's far out? Nope, a couple of things.

Volatility is what brings people in to even create a baseline liquidity. But if volatility expands a lot, let's say based on really big moves in GameStop, if that happens, volatility will, the market makers are going to widen the markets. And this is largely to protect themselves. Otherwise, they can get ran over. I know a lot of people want to look at the market makers and make the amount to be the bad guy. And I'm not saying that they're all angels. They definitely have their motivations. But they still have pretty difficult periods to manage risk, especially in like really hyperbolic markets. So if vol starts skyrocketing, whether because the market is flying up or the market's crashing down, the market makers are going to widen those bit-ask spreads and everything will become wide. Now to your point, if you go further out in time, it naturally is less liquid. So if we look at these seven-day options, let's find us a 80-dalta-ish. I see them here at the 24s, and I see them bid 244 offered 260. If I go out here to the same 81-dalta-ish, this is an 80-dalta, their bid 795 offered at a 20.

But the further out in time you go, the wider those markets tend to get. So this is another great example. If we go out now to the 20 June's, you'll see that the 79-dalta closes to 81 that we have. Bid 1040 offered 1175. So you will fight some level of liquidity to answer a braces question, but it's not like that's going to murder your ability to make any money. It just means you're going to take a bigger haircut, getting out of the position. And we can go back. We literally, we have time. We can go into the, into on demand. Let's go to the 14th. And let's check out like maybe midday. Let's go to on demand. And this is of May. May 14th. About midday take us to like 11. And let's see. Let's see what these, what these options we're looking like. And this is crazy. Notice how crazy that looks right now they get the ball just fucking jacking up here. Nuts. All right.

Yeah, so let me take us a couple days back to for a comparison. Let's go to 30 April. April 30. So what I want to do is show you guys on a relative basis, what happens even if the underlying jacks to the upside. I want to show you what happens to the options in terms of liquidity. So in this case, let's up to this to that. So in this case, if we go to the at the money, the 11s, right now they're bid at one, oh, two offered at one, 10. So that's eight cents wide. Now the first thing I want to inform you guys on is that this is actually really wide for such a cheap product. But these options are also really, really elevated for such a cheap product. It's actually like completely fascinating. It's one of the reasons why this thing is so fun for me to look at because it does a lot of very strange things.

We'll go to the 21 June's that are 38 days out. And then let's grab like 25, okay? So we're not seeing anything here that's kind of annoying. Maybe 31's? Nope, that's kind of annoying. Let me see. So you can already tell how weird this is, right? Like I can't even find out of the money options to look at with you guys. I'm trying to find options that are around like 55 Delta. But it's behaving so crazily. Let me see if I get it closer to the open before it went through all of this madness. Let's do like 0900. And it's still already went through the madness. Maybe I'll go one day before. And I know that it shows up in the 17 Mays. So we can look at those two if we have to. I wanted to give you guys a clue. Yeah, this is fine. This will work.

So the 34s and the 35s, the 35s are crazy wide, right? So right now if we look at the 34s, they're 5550 to 575. So 25 cents wide. So even though price went up pretty significantly, the value of the same Delta option is skyrocketed. And if you look at this next option, it's bid at 355 offered at 635. So this is the market's widening their liquidity. So if we go further out in time, let's do like these 19 July's, you'll see that they're also wide, but they're not like not tradable wide. They're just wide. So in this case, the 25s, their bid 1070 offered 1165. So you're taking a dollar haircut essentially.

But yeah, that's the short answer to that one. Oh, Rama says, how do you think about diversification? Yeah, that's a great question. So diversification is super important, but too much of it's also not good, which I think is kind of a slept on concept. The reason being is because there are people that I know and I've come across quite a lot of them that they'll have a bunch of positions on, but each position is worth 1 of the portfolio.

So in my opinion, the concept of diversification really, really, really comes down to striking a balance, making sure that you have enough diversification to make sure that you align with your objectives, but you're not too diversified and you're not making any money if you're getting moves. So yeah. Ruta Begas says, since they did a case exponentially, should you just move your position further in every time it starts accelerating? So first, I take your question to mean under the assumption of your buying options and if you're buying options, you can institute kind of a structure so that when theta starts eating too much of your lunch, you move your options out. It's literally exactly what I did today in the 16 augs. I could have waited another few days like we're not within 30 days, which is my specific window where I really want to start doing something, but it lined up well with the price movement.

So that's, it's not like a discreet, always do it, a set kind of way and it's because it's market dependent on what the market's doing, but yeah, absolutely. If you gain exposure in the 90 ADT, 70 DT, the 49, whatever you want, you could pick a time frame that as it starts getting closer to that, you want to get out. Now, again, there's a million ways to do this and I want to make sure that you guys understand that I'm talking to you from my perspective because there's also something to be said for coming within 30 days and you can still trade options in this time frame. I do periodically. It's just not my go to. So when I'm talking to you guys from like this broader sense of generalities, that's what I'm sharing. But there's absolutely nothing that's going to break you. If you come in here to a 14 day trade, 14 DTE, if you think your move is going to occur in 14 DTEs and you can go super deep in the money. You can buy these 87 Delta's or most of these are not super liquid. I don't love them. Maybe these 22 Delta, the 22 strike calls that are bid for 20 gigat, and they're offered at 465, but on these, you're literally",

So you're not on a relative basis that's pretty high-fated a K for what's going to come out of them. But it's still as a gross dollar amount, that's not going to kill you. So that's why this game of picking strikes or selecting explorations is so cool is because you have the ability to really structure positions that align with what you're trying to do. So I just dropped another video in there about buying call options smarter. It uses GameStop as a reference, but it's not limited to GameStop. It's about kind of this process. How to strike a balance between DTEs, Delta's, because as we talked about before, we know that if you pick up a higher Delta, your option's going to be more expensive. So how do you figure out how high you want to go? The neat part about it is you literally can develop a pretty simple system that looks at what makes sense based on your objectives for the position.

Oh yeah, Paul says do you build Delta neutral portfolios? Are you using some other portfolio strategy? No, I do not build Delta neutral portfolios. I think the concept of Delta neutral portfolios sounds so appealing because people get nervous about risk and they like the idea of being able to make money in all markets and shit like that. But the way I think about building like the portfolio disposition is 100 tied to what I think about the market. So I actually have, as you guess, I think I built a slide in here about it. Let's find that bad boy. Uh, nope, not that one. You like that pink though or that purple, whatever that color is? I think it's pretty legit. Yo, where is this here? And here. So when I look at the idea of setting up a portfolio, it's going to be aligned to this stuff. So what this means is, let's say for example, I think the market is going to go up.

Why would I wanna have a Delta neutral portfolio if I think the market is going to go up? Well, the benefit to doing that is if if the market goes down, you can make some money on those other positions. But from my perspective, I would rather just adjust the portfolio as the market goes down and then switch. That's the cool part about being a retail trader is that I don't have a mandate. I don't have any rules placed on me on how much money I have to use at a specific point in time or what kind of draw down I can sustain or literally anything like that. I have complete autonomy over what I choose to do. So for example, T-Triple Cues, I literally had a full exit yesterday and I re-entered the majority of the position today. It's a complete pivot. And there's nothing that stops you from doing that as a retail trader. You just have to be careful not to go too far down that rabbit hole and whip sawing around. You lose a lot of money that way.

All right, any other questions that we want to hit, Rolando says they sent you a question. It's above, I don't know where it is, man. Okay, see it. Another question, when is it best to roll options? Is it better to roll or selling them by another contract? I see. So I have a couple videos for you on that that you can take a look at. And funny enough, I have another video dropping tomorrow on rolling. So, and I think we actually talked about that. Why in depth during one of our recent live sessions? So that first one is about rolling kind of a broad concept. The second one is about a bunch of common myths about rolling. And then this third one is coming out tomorrow.

So, yeah, there's a couple of resources there for you. All right, let's talk about this idea of building strategies. When I think about the concept of building a trading strategy, and again, I'm not going to spend much time in this slide deck, I just want to show you a couple guiding concepts. And then really what I want to do for this section actually is look at your ideas and walk you through how I would think about building traits. That's the intention here. So when I think about the idea of building strategies, one of the most important concepts is maintaining some sort of edge. And there's different ways you can access edge, which I will give you some ideas, but I want to show you this. So this slide, let me see if I can large, make this a little bit larger so that the people in the back can see. Let me know if that's visible enough.

Because otherwise you're not really going to be able to follow along at all with what I'm going to say. Hi, this is a overview of how I think about building a strategy. You can see that there are a few steps. These, this here is essentially the process that I would look to follow to kind of build a strategy and the way it would work. I don't know why that would be at that crazy of an angle. That's just silly to me. There we go. So the idea would be you would flow through this literally just like this. And what I try to think about is a process that's replicable over time. And it can deliver consistent results. Because that's going to be one of the largest aspects of building a successful trading strategy. Is finding a way to build ideas that you can then deploy and optimize over time. Because it's not that easy. And one of the biggest mistakes that you can make in doing this is to have this really haphazard bullshit approach that it doesn't allow you to actually test ideas.

So let's talk about these kind of in a general sense. And then like I said, we'll literally dive directly into an example. The first thing I'm going to do is define the purpose of the strategy. So that's predicated on this. So if we go back to the way I think about really the world of trading, it's in this light up here. Notice how I take a very hierarchical top down approach to this whole thing. I'm looking at big picture items and then boiling them down to smaller things. So when I look at the portfolio, I split my portfolio into a core allocation and a speculative allocation. I now know that I need to have a couple ideas that can work in all of these. And I've already given you kind of the cheat sheet for the stuff that I do, which is this right here. This is essentially the comprehensive breakdown of the overwhelming number of trades that I put on at a given point in time. You literally can find them all here.

And I want stuff that allows me to trade most market conditions. So the way to answer this first part, purpose of strategy for me, I would outline a strategy that allows me to trade every single market condition. That's the first thing I would be looking for. And I think I have a slide in here. Do I? I think I do. Yeah, this one. This shows you like exactly the stuff that I'm looking to trade. I'm looking to have things that allow me to trade directionally up and down. I'm looking to trade volatility and all of its individual little quirks, whether it's the clustering, the variance risk premiums, whether it's relative value plays, whether it's skew, there's a million things you can trade. So these are the broad buckets of what I'm looking to trade. So why does this matter? Why do I go through the effort of explaining this to you guys? Well, it's pretty simple.

You can get to that point if you want. There's not to wrong with it if that's your approach. But I would literally start by just defining a you need a strategy to trade things that are going up. You probably want a strategy to trade things that are going down. If you want to trade both sides of direction, I do. Like those are completely reasonable places to start right there. You don't necessarily have to go further than that to start. It's totally up to you, but that's a reasonable starting point to take. So capital gains is this idea of making money as direction occurs. You can trade things for income. You can want to have a strategy to hedge a portfolio. You have to start with what you're trying to do. Then we need to isolate the profit mechanism.

How can you find a profit mechanism? How can you determine what makes sense? Easy. It is easy. You can look for things and trends around price direction up or down. You can look for things relative to volatility. How does it behave? What does it do? What are some of its traits? You can look for market inefficiencies. There are a lot of ideas.

But it is absolutely still worth checking out. I'm thankful of teaching that you brought this one up. Good call. There's quant pdia. All right. So strategy, what's the purpose? What are we trying to do with this individual strategy that we're looking to build? Then we need to determine from that what kind of profit mechanism are we trying to take advantage of? So again, I give you several ideas right here. From there, Reese says, do you have the link to retail trading habits pitfalls? Yeah, that's on my website. So on my website, good old fashion, esinvest.com, if you go here and to here, all of those studies are available here. So you can literally just drop those in and I cite kind of the key takeaways from all of them. Why do I have this here? Because I think it's freaking important for people to know what the landscape looks like. So Reese, yes, you can access it there.

We should outline a list of perspective strategies that allow us to take advantage of the profit mechanism that you are interested in. That is the entire point of that step. So what that means in a practical sense is, for example, Jay says, damn, without couch potato buying you dinner, are you going to, are you going hungry tonight? Yeah, I know, man, I'm like, shit, I'm supposed to order Greek and I'm about to be on the hook for it. We might starve. I'll be honest, maybe doing a little bit of a fast isn't the worst thing ever. I'm still pretty fat. So I could stand to lose a few more pounds and maybe just do some salsa water. Maybe that's the future for me here. The structure list is where you just jot down different structures that allow you to take advantage of whatever it is that you're trying to trade.

Now, before I test all of them, I can naturally exclude some of the strategies. If forward ever reason for a broader structural reason, it doesn't fit what I'm trying to do. So for example, let's say I already have a long option strategy that I like to trade to the upside. If I like it, I already tested it. There's not an inherent need for me to duplicate having another long option strategy to trade to the upside. That's not saying that there's others that couldn't work, not even saying that there are others that could work better. But I would go through that process as I'm trying to build the long option strategy to the upside. So you can naturally exclude things if you already have suitable strategies that do what you want them to do from the jump. So we take all of these and then we test them. We test them with a large data set. We then segment the data into smaller components. We test it. And then we evaluate the robustness. How well does it work? How consistent is",

Am I comfortable with things like the maximum drawdown, those kinds of ideas? How do you test? You can either purchase access to back testing software. You can run it in Python yourself. You could probably ask chat GPT or another tool like that to help you. You can use something like on demand in thinkorswim. And you can go back in time and you can manually test your ideas. This is a much slower process. This isn't the way that I would start personally. If you're trying to look through a bunch of different things, there is absolutely nothing wrong with starting to do this. If you're not even sure how to test, this will teach you a lot going through this specific process. So next, after that, let me slide that there. Come back out of on demand.

This is where we're taking a structure and we're turning it into a strategy. So for example, a structure is long call. You can now parameterize that long call. And you could say, well, maybe I'll buy it when the moving average slope for 14 day and seven day moving averages, they're positive. Okay, that's a criteria you can use. You can tinker with as many criteria as you would like. My recommendation is to go through a process where you evaluate the efficacy of signals standalone. So what that means is if I want to use moving averages, if I want to know if moving averages are an effective tool for me to evaluate this long bias directional thing I'm trying to trade. The first thing I'm going to do is go to SSRN type in moving average. This is what I see. So the first thing I'm going to do is leverage other people's research and piggyback off of it.

This is quite literally the absolute worst time on planet earth to attempt to figure out what to do. Literally about is bad is it can possibly get. So I would absolutely recommend not doing that with literally without a doubt. I would not do that. Policies how do you choose data providers? That's a great question. So for market data and options data, I use CBO, but they're not the cheapest choice. So I do have a couple companies I'm affiliated with. They're typically in the description to my videos. Literally the reason why I affiliate with anybody is to get people discounts on things. Most of them don't really pay me anything worthwhile, but the products that I'm affiliated with that I think are genuinely good are things like Orats, Options Omega, Benzenga, BarChart. They all have different options data available to you depending on what you're trying to do. But for me personally, I literally go through CBO and I buy their market data directly.

Nathan asks, when you use Python scripts to test new strat, you ever use LLM type script to forecast as well? Definitely. Yeah. And there's no reason not to. So there's a component about forward testing that's a slightly different bucket than back testing. I think it's really important to back test first to see what you can get to work, to see what kind of aligns with the objectives that you have and what fits well with the portfolio. And then you can absolutely start looking at forward testing ideas using either some sort of generator or like a random market sampling technique that's another really effective one to create like a new path, stuff like that.

No, it's not too vague at all. In those instances, I typically use like some sort of trailing stop. That's my approach. So for example, T triple queues. I've been buying into this for the majority of the year, but definitely a depth of the position started going on as we came out of this drop and kind of scaling up towards the end of April beginning of May. So the original price target that I had essentially was taking it from 60. And what I do for these kinds of price targets is I go further out in time. So like two years, I have to go even further. Let's go to five years. So what I do is I say, what references do I have to other perspective support and resistance? So you can see that there's some congestion here at like the 68 handle.

So that's the give me an idea of where I'm trying to take this thing to, how I'm trying to ride it. And then when it hits 75 bucks, I don't just take the trade off because it's doing what I want as long as it continues to do what I want, I absolutely would not take the trade off. But what I do is I start setting stops. So in this case, the initial stop that I use specifically in T triple queues was when either I had a greater than 3 drop within an individual day or if price fell below the 14 day MA and a 20, I think this one's a 20, let me see this one, 22.

I think that that kind of does you a disservice. And for me, like I said, I typically like to use something like a like a 10 day 11 day 14 day, there's a million combinations. I'll get rid of this seven though, just so it's a little less noisy to give you an idea. The other thing I do like to use though is the the slope of moving averages. So the fact that that seven day MA essentially turned negative, let me go back and add it back in. I just want to show you specifically what I was looking out there. So I want this to be seven. And then I'm going to make this bad boy red. So the reason by the way that I do like red for this is because since I have like multiple moving averages, it literally helps me track a little more cleanly like Roy G bib. That's the old Roy G bib.

Then you can see that this also had a pretty big red day, but the seven day MA slope was still positive. In this case, the seven day MA slope literally flipped negative. So that is not something that I take lightly. There's other tools that I use, but in this case, that's essentially a big part of the trigger. That's also why up here, as you can tell, like I actually have the various MA slopes. And you can codify this in essentially however you want. Let me see if I can find it. This one. So I have MA slopes for all different periods. So like I can add the seven day back in. And then essentially, I would add it down here as another input into this, but that's the idea at least behind using the moving average slopes.

Sort of. Not inherently. So what example would I give you that would qualify the not inherently part? Do you have any ideas? And in the meantime, I'll pop this open and see if I can't add that that other slope in here. So what other criteria can you guys think of that would lead what they're talking about to not always be the case? Dr. Zayah says, I didn't have a ticker in my, no, no, it's not specific to a ticker. What I'm actually talking about is a broader topic. It's, yeah, it's definitely not something that's specific to a ticker, actually literally at all. So yeah, you don't have to worry about that. That's not what I'm referring to here. Volume, nope, not volume. Good guess, but that ain't it. Earnings, nope, not it either. Interesting. Very interesting. So no, the way to think about it is, I want you guys",

So where is Delta and where is gamma? How would those impact the decision on where we would see this example where I'm talking specifically about longer dated options, actually seeing potentially more of a move as compared to the shorter dated options? It is tied completely to Delta and to gamma. So what do you guys think? There's a specific timeframe that we would see the options move a lot more on a relative basis as compared to other time frames, but it can flip when we look at something like Delta and gamma. Any ideas you guys? And in the meantime, we got our script back up so that you guys can see those other slopes. So you can see the seven day, 22 day, 50 and 200. Intrinsic value is not correct.

So Dr. Zeyes asked what effect is price movement in the underlying have on each expiration cycle? The nearest expiration will experience more change relative to longer dated. So what he's asking is if the price in we got to pick something else, let's look at Lulu. So if the price in Lulu moves either direction up or down, they're postulating that that movement will impact the shorter term expirations more than the longer term expirations. And it's partially correct, partially incorrect. So I'm asking you guys to decipher the difference. What element of it is partially correct? And what element is partially incorrect? Carlos speculates theta, which would be a great example of an incorrect answer. Rises via gamma, yes, percentage wise, closer. Closer. Dr. Zeyes says thank you for deep diving this love. And yeah, this is, it's a great question. This is, again, this is how people learn. So let's take a look at an example.

Is it the 200 call that's out 431 days? Or is it, I forgot why expiration were in or the 350s that are at a 46 delta with four days to go. These are about as close as you can get before expiration. Which one of those would move more? Delta J, bingo. That's the first part of the equation. Right. Delta, go back to the basics. Delta tells us the rate of change of in options premium. Res says front experee, bad timing because you are wrong. And that sucks. It sucks to be wrong. Now, actually, we can, we can make res partially right here on a relative basis in terms of the cost of the option. They might make more money.

Well, they have a 46 delta. So if Lulu goes up one dollar, let's just say that these are 4 for ease. Let's say you bought them at 4. If it goes up 1, these would give you 46 cents of profit. So your 4 are now worth 4.46. You've made 46. We go out here, 431 days back into the 90 delta to the 200s. If Lulu goes up a dollar, you've made 90. Your way further out in time, but it is a 90 delta. So that means is Lulu moves up by 1. These options make 90 cents. The front expiration in that example, you've made 46 cents or 40 whatever sense it was. So that is a prime example of how going further out in time, you can actually make more money than the near term. Benoit says, but those are hugely different position sizes on an equally on an equal equity basis sooner x-rays would always have a larger move. If you were to isolate it in that sense in terms of a percentage gain, yes. Well, it also would depend on how far out you go, right? It's a bit of a sliding scale.

On a percentage gain, you will see larger percentage gains on shorter dated options. But again, this is the important part of being a thinking trader, right? Because the name of the game at the end of the year isn't, what is the percentage gain on the portfolio? Would you want a 100 gain on a 1 portfolio or a 10 gain on a 100 portfolio? I would absolutely take the lower percent return on the larger principle yielding a larger dollar amount. So that's what I look for, even when I'm structuring things like my GameStop trades that I'm putting on. That's why I'm going further out in time is I'm going further in the money. I'm not going far out in time and then hanging out here in the ether because to a lot of your guys' point, which you're seeing very well, these will have a lower gamma. So these won't move as much.

But you might pay a larger principle up front, but it's also a little bit of a deductible because you're going really far in the money. There's a lot of intrinsic value. So if the underlying doesn't move, let's say it stays flat or goes up slightly, your extrinsic value, your cost of holding that position is not that high. Now you are paying a larger gross amount. So if the underlying is a big sweeping move against you, you do stand to lose more money. But again, that's the nature of being a trader. If you have an option that's at a one delta and you let it become a 30 delta, you've grossly fucked up. You've not done your job as a trader. So the way to think about aspirations is it's part of the equation along with delta's. But you can have longer expirated options that make more money than near term expiration options entirely possible. And you can have vice versa. You can have the inverse.

I generally try to be almost completely allocated. So I'd rather have the larger percent move if I have all my funds allocated. Do you? Is that actually what you would want? Which scenario would you make more money? So if we put equivalent size positions on and there's a specific trade off and the point emerges sooner or later that you'll notice. Let's go back to Lulu and let's pretend we're structuring a trade to the downside because Lulu cannot catch a bid quite literally to save its life. So let's say you want to trade Lulu to the downside. And you want short term dated options because they expand more, but we're going to buy puts and let's say let's just pretend that this was more liquid.

Let's see what size move you need in order for these near dated out of the money puts in order to make more money than the in the money puts. So in order to help us visualize that, I'm going to add a few different standard deviations. I'm going to use plus one and minus one. And this is just standard deviation move of the underlying price plus two minus two plus three minus three. Okay. So let's see. At a minus one standard deviation, you make three 17. At a minus two standard deviation, you make 1058. And at a minus three standard deviation, you make 2042. Now let's go back to this one. If you make a one standard deviation down move, you make 784. So 784 compared to 316, 317, you make more here. 1777 on a two standard deviation move compared to 1053. So you still make more here. And then on a three standard deviation move, you make 2800 here versus 2000 here.

However, it won't outpace the profit side. So let's take a look at the next component then, which is you have the ability to size this trade up. Right. So if this cost me 6,345 bucks for this one individual position, you could put on like 63 of these. You could put on a ton. So that starts to look really good, doesn't it? Because then you can say, well, well, shit, if I get a one standard deviation move in my favor, I make 20 grand on the same size position. That seems fantastic. Does it not? Not so much. Why is that? Well, there's a really, really important difference here. Take a look at my theta on this trade 4.99. That's on my one lot. If I do the same size trade, my theta is 1,144. So you can make way more money if you get your move in the correct amount of time. If you don't or if it's not a big enough move fast enough, theta will completely eat your lunch.

If you're 20,000 profit there, it just turned to 18,355 one day later. One day later, your max profit on that one standard deviation move just went down 1700. If it's two days later, it just went down another 4,000. This is exactly the issue and this is exactly the trade off. So going back to your question, Benoit, for me, I focus more on what kind of risk makes sense for my thesis and then structuring a position around that. So Benoit, if you take a look at that video that I made or the video I shared earlier, it walks through how I think of this. So Benoit says this is just another rehash of the buy better calls video. That's exactly correct. Yep, that's exactly correct. And it's because the way I think about it is it's not saying that further out in time is better.

You know, chill house. Any other questions on that? That was a great question, by the way, though. I'm really, really stoked. Okay, cool. So it sounds like that connected. Great. Sweet. So let's go back and kind of finish a quick walk through then of this example of this year, building a strategy. So let's say that I want to trade stuff to the upside. If I'm looking for some sort of breakout idea and let's say you do a bunch of homework and you identify, you know, as you're going through SSRN and you're looking at all these different kinds of things.

    "text": "looking at all these different kinds of things. Let's say that you find that stocks that are making 52 week highs tend to have a drift component to them and to continue to make relative highs. And if you're kind of picking up what I'm putting down, that's it is an effect. I know it exists. It's a momentum effect. It's called a momentum premia. There's different ways to capitalize on it. So I'm giving you an example of a already baked profit function, which is what this is. So from there, the first step here, let me see if I can like shrink this and keep it as we look through this. This might be like really difficult for you guys to see. So I'll kind of like talk about it as we look at stuff. But the purpose of the strategy in this case is we're building something that allows us to capitalize on upward price movement. We don't care yet if it's long premium, short premium, doesn't matter. We just want something that allows us to make money if stock goes up. The profit mechanism that we're talking about, the direction is up. And we're looking for something that exhibits momentum premia. So we now need to, I guess, we need to do like this is really where signal test would make sense, wouldn't it? I think that makes way more sense. Yeah. And then this would be more like a signal alignment. So Ridley says, so",

Yeah. And then this would be more like a signal alignment. So Ridley says, so identify catalysts first, definitely. So the very well, kind of the second step for me is to identify a profit mechanism. What do I think I can make money from? So again, in this case, we're talking about trying to trade something to the upside. So I would need to test that signal. And there are different ways I can think about qualifying and quantifying that profit mechanism. So I can look at again, this one is kind of already done for the sake of time. But you can look at the performance of stocks. Let's say that have the highest PE ratios or the lowest price to book ratios or the lowest price to earnings growth ratios. If you wanted to use some fundamental tools, you could use stocks that are trading above 50 moving averages. So what I'm highlighting there is you can gain exposure to a lot of different things. And depending on how you want to quantify it, you can access it in slightly different ways. So in this case, like I said, I'm kind of giving you a already baked concept.

So if I'm looking up this momentum premium idea, there's a couple of things that matter a lot to me. So do I still have this open? I don't hear. We can use what I'm doing is I'm going through like my litany of studies. And I'm finding examples of momentum premium like this here. So this is an example of momentum premium. You can look for things that have specific parameters for an earnings release. And then you can essentially trade it in a bunch of different ways. I'm texting my wife real quick. She's hungry. So I just ordered her dinner. So in this case, you can look at host earnings and there's a bunch of different criteria that can be met and that becomes your signal. So things that have a gap up, things that tend to be smaller market cap stocks, meaning not mega cap stuff like that becomes part of your signal. And then you can test that any way that you want.

We now can build a list of structures that allow us to trade to the upside. You guys already did this actually. So if you think about this kind of thing, what structures can apply here? Walk me through what you think what you think makes sense. And then in the meantime, Roy and Titi says, how do you do that for mergers acquisitions? You literally can test. You can find, you can create an entire list of companies, public companies that have undergone MA. And then you can look at price behavior pre-post volatility behavior pre-post. It's exactly what I would do. It's another very tradable thing, by the way. And also you can very frequently detect when there is a perspective MA process underway. If you take a look at the options chains, which are mega, mega informative. So to recap the other structures that you guys already listed, there are things like long calls, buying shares, short puts.

The first thing I would do is say, okay, maybe for this 52 week high, I would look at sorting all stocks that are optionable. And in this case, I'm using weeklies just for liquidity measure. I'm going to sort them by those making the highest 52 week highs at a given point in time. And I'm going to essentially simulate purchasing the top 10 of them, the top desiolate if you're selling client or really whatever number you want. And I'm just going to focus first on using the underlying itself, meaning buying shares. Or if I wanted to trade it to the downside, shorting shares. Why would I do that if I'm testing kind of the profit potential? And the ideally testing a bunch of different structures, why do you guys think I would do it that way? Starting with just the shares. Any ideas? There's a very specific reason. Because it's at the high. So it's uncertain. It's a good question, but no, that's not it.

So right now, I'm just trying to understand, based on this profit mechanism that I think exists that I've tested with a couple different signals. I want to see how it performs if I just use the underlying, because remember, options essentially are just amplified versions of the underlying with a bunch of additional rules. So for example, if I buy shares and I make money with this structure, well, that already tells me something. It means that if I use options, it'll make money. It means that if I sell puts or buy calls, it'll make money. I already know it makes money because it makes money if the underlying goes up. But it becomes an assessment of quality. So for example, if I test long shares and I want to test holding for a week, two weeks, a month, two months, three months, six months, 12 months, something like that. I'm going to look for trends across all those different timeframes. And then I'm going to say, okay, well, it seems like, based on this smattering of underlines that I bought,",

And then I can overlay and build some sort of option equivalent to that. It's harder to back test. Now, if you have the savvy, it's not that difficult. But you can absolutely use that as a starting point. And if you notice that your long shares make money. And let's say that on average, you see a 5 drift over the following month. Well, now you have something to work with because if I know that there's a 5 average drift over the course of the following month, now I can say, well, does it make more sense to buy calls or more sense to sell puts? And you can do a simple comparison. So let's use this as an example. Let's say that we want to use VRT. And if I know that over the month, it's probably going to go up by 5.

You have 70 delta makes sense here, like 75 delta maybe. Do like a 72 delta call. And it's 15 55. So here's the first thing I need to determine. Based on the position here, which one do I like more? Do I want to outlay 15 55 bucks? Maybe, there's nothing wrong with that if your portfolio has room for it. Or you'd have to see what the margin requirement is for the 42 and a half put, which in this case, it's 8,250 bucks. So in terms of capital utilization, you actually can use more from the long calls. And again, maybe it doesn't matter to you. Maybe you have the margin in there and you just don't care. But now we can then assess, well, if we get our 5 move, how does my short put do? I make 119 on my 80 to 50 outlay. If I get my 5 move to the upside on the calls, I get 336. And there's no margin requirements. You're going to pay for it in cash, which is 15 55.",

Well, if it moves in your favor, unequivocally, you make more money with the long calls. This is how you back into what makes sense. So now I would overlay the risk management. Let's say that I'm going to manage risk here at 8560, just because I think if it drops below that, it looks like it would probably head towards 8224 and I don't want to take it that far, whatever. So let's call it if there's a close below 85. So now what we can do is we can say, all right, well, if price goes to my stop point of 85, how do these perform? The long call, if it goes to, I guess I should, wait, oh, duh, I'm an idiot, sorry. My bad. If it goes to 85, in this case, you lose 325 bucks. And in this case, you lose 165.

So now we have to take the next step, which is what's the probability of us getting this 5 up move versus this 85 or I'm sorry, this 85 price point stoppage. So now we can go to probability and we can look at the probability of a touch. And we can look over the next month for like a normalized time frame. So using like the 16 aug maybe. And what's the probability of us being stopped out to the downside at 85? It is 83. And then what's the probability of us hitting that 95 handled to the upside? to about 78. So now guess what?

And then in the meantime, Banner, Vera, Plains. I like your plans to you. Is can you talk about cash secured puts? Yeah, sure. What about cash secured puts? Let me know what you want to dive into. Chewie says does that work with your DTE? Of course. The process is agnostic to everything. It's again, it's a probabilistic assessment. But yeah, the process itself is essentially standardized. So that's the point of building an approach like that is you don't have to go through a lot of different stages realistically. You can kind of codify what works well to test a lot of different concepts. So a fan of airplanes, what's your approach for using CSPs? Really, I only use them as part of the coverage triangle.

However, I do not in general run a lot of CSPs. I'm even finding myself more and more as of late with the way that the market is behaving recently. Spending way more time trading things like the ratio called diagonals. I'm not like fully out of using something like the coverage triangle, obviously. But what I'm doing in a pretty big way is trying to use the indices more and more. And a lot of that is to just be more tax efficient. And when you're trading the indices themselves, they do not have options or an underlying that you can trade. So yeah, I think that's kind of like the long and short of it. Accounting guy, wondering if you've tried estimating parameters for a Heston model for option pricing. I'm trying to build a Monte Carlo Sim, but not getting real estate results.

    "text": "getting real estate results. Yeah, that's the problem that you likely will have if you're going through the process and trying to estimate your own wall. Heston is okay, but it misses a ton of stuff. So I think most people that are trying to estimate their own wall are using some sort of variation of a garsh model. But even those you need to include some sort of jump diffusion because accounting for gaps is really, really, really, really important. So something you can tinker with is this website from New York University Stern. And you can take a look at a bunch of different kinds of wall models that they tinker with. And you can see what seems to represent the world a little bit better for you. And then you can essentially see what you want to replicate from this, at least is a starting point. But the Heston, it's too simplistic. It misses too much. So yes, I have used it, but it does not surprise me that you're not getting real estate results. Yeah. Dr. Zayas says, I'm wondering about IRA accounts, pros and cons of IRA account for trading options. Yeah, that's totally fine. I trade options in an IRA account. There are slightly different rules that go along with it. I actually literally think I have videos on trading options in an IRA. You see, I do. A little bit old, but I think it's still probably, probably right. So there's that video",

But yeah, you just have to change the approach a little bit is what it boils down to. But I use I use a IRA literally all the time for trading. It's less frequent. But like I'll still look at it every couple weeks, week, every other week, something like that. And the only the only broader concept there is less so like if it makes sense to trade in an IRA, because of course it does, especially if it's a Roth IRA, something that's tax deferred, depending on what your tax footprint looks like going forward. I'm obviously not a tax professional, not a financial professional, nothing I say. Should be taking his financial advice. I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. But you can look at how an IRA fits into your life because a big drawback to IRAs is when you want to access it. And there's kind of a liquidity cost to it because you can't get into them. Now going further down the IRA, but hold there's a lot of gaps you can take advantage of. There's different rules you can exploit that are perfectly legal.",

Now going further down the IRA, but hold there's a lot of gaps you can take advantage of. There's different rules you can exploit that are perfectly legal. But like for example, with an IRA, if you want to access it early, you can use it to buy your house if it's your first house. Like towards your first house, there's more rules to it. I don't know, because I never got to use it myself. But that's just a way you can tap into it a little bit early. So the tricky part with IRAs is it pertains to being a trader is if your aspiration is to retire early, which I think that's the whole point of doing this, then an IRA is kind of tricky because you definitely want the money there for when you get older, but you also can't access it quite as much.

Tell me why I shouldn't go deep in the money calls three months out for Sophie. Seems really good for those right now. Let's see. Let's take a look at some so five. I mean, the short answer is because it's going down. If you buy calls, you want the underlying to go up and right now the underlying as you see it here is not going up. So that is the short answer on why going deep in the money three months out for Sophie may not make sense is because it's not going up and idea. Roryntitty says what about using Otoco?

Can you review options chain AMD July 19 Xperi does look bullish? Okay, so the first thing is that the options chain itself isn't what I would worry about looking bullish. It's the stock options are derivatives and their value is tied to the stock. So in this case, right now in general, it looks like AMD is going through a little bit of a cycling period and it looks like it's still ascending, which is good news. But it looks like it's rotating over. I do like the moving averages. Those look good. Six month timeframe. It's definitely declining. Three month timeframe. It's got a nice pop here, but before that, it was relatively static. Yeah, so it like very cleanly broke above that 171 handle.

That's kind of like wind in its face as I would consider it. And then looking at the options in general, really, really slight call, oh, I skew very slight though, not much. Much more active call trading on the 12 July's really short term. It has earnings coming up on the 30th. I think that'll be pretty important. We can see how it's done on its previous earnings. Down on the last one down on the one before there up down down up down up. So kind of a general split. Earnings has been coming down though, which I don't love. What is this January? So January to January though is slightly up. So you're over year there, that's not bad. And then April. Yeah. So Cliff Notes version is, it looks kind of like a mixed bag.

I see that downtrend is people taking their profits and then finding a temple bottom. It could do that. But again, like, it doesn't matter why it's in a downtrend, right? Like a downtrend is a downtrend. It's a thing for a reason. Now in a long term time frame, it's very clearly in an uptrend. So like this is okay. But like this here is a downtrend, whether it's because they're selling to take profits and it's going to form a bottom here if they're selling because they're sad and they want to buy a puppy. It doesn't matter. What matters is if you want something to go up and it's going down, you lose money. So the origin of the downtrend doesn't matter until it's not a downtrend anymore. So when I look at something like this, it's starting to pivot, right? Like this on a six-month daily is a downtrend. It's going down. But it did base heavily here. And it is absolutely starting to go up. But it has some near-term resistance to break through still.

But in that short-term time frame, it very much is in a downtrend. In this case, three months uptrend, for sure. And I think the broader component is it really depends on the time frame that like the trade is being looked at for. And in this case, short-term time frame, it does not look like this is going to the moon. It looks like it had a really large sympathetic move with broader tech. That's a lot of what I see here. And it does have earnings coming up on the 30th. So Dr. Zayah says, yep, I was looking at it at a longer time frame. Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely. On a longer time frame, it for sure has an uptrend.

So a lot of it will depend on how it behaves in here. My expectation would be that it would probably base in this level a little bit like 171 to 186 until it can get a break above 186. And then my guess is it would want to run up towards here like the 213 to 15 handle, something like that. So we will see. Growing to the says, can our strategy be do whatever Nancy Pelosi does?
