    "text": "what's up everyone happy Monday we're going to take a look at the GameStop options chain couple things going on nothing really jumping out of me just yet it seems we're vastly kind of in this consolidation phase but before we get too far into that just a couple announcements the first one is if you haven't seen this video with Ian on Jame Lee's channel it's very good and I really like the way that he breaks down a lot of the totality of the story it's a very simple concept ceps so if you haven't had a chance to listen to this I think it's worth worth to listen it's like 15 minutes the other one that I actually think you need to watch is Newton's new video and it's not just cuz he has some super sick hair that's on fleek with Snorlax behind them it's because he talks a little bit towards the end of this video about the swaps this is important and I actually think that this is something I've been doing more research on myself so it's funny timing that he was talking about it here because it talks about the positions that we think some of these different actors and entities might be in and then the way that they need to move about these positions with respect to GameStop price so absolutely worth checking this out all right that aside and the actually the last thing is this Saturday same time",
