    "text": "Okay. Here from Alaska, I saw a lot going on in the market. I want to take a look at it with you guys and know, I am not an angel. This is just some light bleeding in from behind me because we are on the mobile setup via the laptop. So actually, first thing I want to play is, where's Walgo? If you can see where we are in this photo, let me know. And I'll give you the answer, but throw it in the comments if you can find us. And if you couldn't, we are right here. You can tell by this big shadow that's kind of casting out from where we're at. But the reason why this water is so blue, we've learned is because of stuff called rock flower, which is from glacial water, which is pretty neat. And then just a couple other photos really quick for you guys. Kind of like a preamble. I'll obviously share a lot more when I have a chance to pull it all down from the drone. But let's get over to the markets, Gally. I have a few things I want to talk about today. I want to talk about the indices writ large. Then I want to talk about where I'm still seeing strength. Then I want to talk a little bit about crowd strike and using it as a conversation for reversals, which was a question that I got from the out our community. And",

Then I want to talk a little bit about crowd strike and using it as a conversation for reversals, which was a question that I got from the out our community. And then I also at the end wanted to go look at GameStop because there were some really interesting options activity that occurred in the last couple days, specifically with some 125 puts. So we'll take a look at those. But first, looking at the indices, what's going on here? Well, as far as I can tell, it looks like the market is really in a mix up, but this is broadly what I'm expecting to see as a broad pullback. So if we look across the indices, we have the eminies, the NASDAQ, the Russell, these are the futures, but there it's essentially the same thing as what you'll see in spy, QQ and I don't know. So first things first, we're seeing a sell off across everything. Pretty clear, no duh, but the structure of the sell off is very different. And what I mean by that is if you take a look at something like the Russell, this is gone parabolic up, trended sideways and is now returned essentially going parabolic down. And it's almost back to where it started, which is kind of insane. And you can use small caps in this kind of setting is like",

And it's almost back to where it started, which is kind of insane. And you can use small caps in this kind of setting is like a proxy for what's going on, what the market is thinking. And right now it's obviously thinking constrained specifically for smaller tap companies. And that's because of a slew of mixed economic data that we're getting in. So we're seeing still probability of a cut in the next meeting. And it's varying quite a lot because the market is starting to show signs of weakness. And because of that, you'll see small caps definitely taking the brunt of this. This is this original rise that you see here is when things were looking good and the market was expecting a cut. And then things started kind of chopping sideways for a little bit and then starting last week into this week, there's been a pretty meaningful contraction in small caps because of this. Now tech is a slightly different story in my opinion because you can see take a look at the slope of this pullback. Take a look at the slope of small caps pullback, right? So small caps essentially gave this all back up over the course of one, two, three days. It's just pure parabolic in nature. You'll see these kinds of moves when it has this",

It's just pure parabolic in nature. You'll see these kinds of moves when it has this kind of parabolic up move unless there's something that really maintains the momentum. And that's because there's not a lot of support and resistance built into price when it moves like this. This is an insane movement. So that's part of the reason why you'll typically see something like this pattern in small caps is it did not build and consolidate on the way up. So on the way down it kind of follows suit, whereas something like tech, you can see it's definitely still drawing back no doubt, but it's a completely different structure. And the eminies, they're kind of somewhere in the middle. They definitely showed a healthy dose of weakness starting on the second. And then it's starting to level out a little bit more than what you're seeing in the NASDAQ. So all in all, pretty interesting price performance so far as far as I'm concerned.

And right now I can't see where I'm at in OBS because I am on my laptops. I only have the same screen you guys are, but I'm guessing I'm covering up some stuff down here. But you'll have to take my word for it. Let me slide this up. Maybe you can see that. I don't know how much you guys will see this, but essentially I'm trying to show you the net highs and lows here. And we came to a point. This is looking in the NASDAQ where even up to the 31st, we still had pretty strong net highs lows. But you'll notice that it was still downward sloping. It wasn't at a point where it was fully consolidating. And the breath indicator really turned pretty heavy. And we saw this massive expansion in lows, gross lows happen on the fifth where we peaked out at negative 331 as compared to highs of 110. So this is a pretty big negative rotation over, but it's already starting to kind of mellow back out and coming back towards the zero line. So what I'm highlighting is that it's definitely a bit of a broad sell off here that we saw happen on the fifth, but it doesn't look like it's heavily sustained so far. And we're definitely dipping into this",

And we're definitely dipping into this value area pretty heavily. As you can tell, the point of control in spy specifically is still like 512 513. So because of these kind of small details, the pullback that we see in my opinion is still generally in line with what I would expect to see for something that has had this kind of first six month move. It's just been a little bit aggressive, which I think is taking some people, I surprise, but it's at a point now where I definitely think you have to be careful with laying out risk. I definitely am. I'm being very cautious with how much capital I'm offering the market right now, which funny enough, I've already made the joke a couple times where it seems like whenever I'm going up on a trip, the market decides to sell off a few people in the discord and highlighted that too, which is just kind of comical. So my portfolio just naturally happens to be pretty light right now, but I'm still trading. I was trading zeros today and those were actually really, really successful. This is one of my favorite periods of time to trade zeros or really any type",

Like we can see, Val is just so that offers a really big opportunity. Now you have to understand that the way that these cards were is you're making a forecast on what does it look like essentially tomorrow. So what I'm highlighting is because realize this so high over implied doesn't inherently mean that where you're at right now is an in opportune time, something like this where it's trending above definitely more in opportune. But with this kind of really large movement, a bit of positive momentum, taking a look at the intraday charts and spy didn't look quite too terrible. So it looked a little bit interesting to me. So now I want to take a quick look what we have coming up on the week and you can see a few things. So if I grab this week's data and we take a look kind of like from a broad perspective, we had PMI come in pretty light. It was expected at 56 came in at 55. The composite PMI also came in light. It was expected at 55 came at 54 or",

And it's because of where we're at in the current cycle. And you'd better believe that any sort of future economic data that releases is going to be looked at with an absolute, it's going to be looked at with a microscope. Because the market is now starting to get a little bit jittery with where we're at. So on the seventh, we have one that I'm interested in. I don't think the market's going to care that much about but consumer credit. I really want to see that. And then on the eighth, jobless claims are going to be a big deal. There's no doubt have to keep an eye on jobless claims. If that starts moving to aggressively outline of expectations, I think the market will kind of have a freak out about that. So it's something else that I'm keeping in on. Right. Let's take a look at CrowdStrike. And specifically, I want to look at this idea of trading reversals because one of the questions was it looks like CrowdStrike was starting to base out.",

And specifically, I want to look at this idea of trading reversals because one of the questions was it looks like CrowdStrike was starting to base out. What do we think about potentially trading this for a reversal play? And like I've been talking to you guys about this trade for a while because I had been trading it to the downside via ratio, put diagonals. And then I ended up getting out just naturally before the trip, funny enough, which happened to be really good timing on the trade. But I would have just kind of followed it otherwise using just stops. But I would have no problem trading this to the upside. The tricky part here though is that the rest of the market isn't to accommodating. So what I mean by that is if I'm trading some sort of price, mean reversion play like this, it is absolutely snapped all the way out like a rubber band super, super far out of line in my opinion. And when I see this kind of price behavior, it does interest me to the upside, especially with this follow through day that I had now, typically speaking, what I would do is essentially look to enter if we come down, we base below this and then you break above in this case, it's the 222 handle, then",

The probability of getting stopped out is really strong. Now the other thing that's even more important in this context is what the broader market is doing that does not have big market wind at its back, meaning tech is doing really well. But it's also important to remember that for CrowdStrike specifically, this move was entirely precipitated by an impact only to window systems, less than 1 of the total systems in its network. So even though like it's impactful, right, like there was a lot of issues caused by it, it's not like this crazy thing that's going to, in my opinion, completely cause CrowdStrike to go under or anything like that. This just looks like a visceral reaction. And again, this is a really well known phenomenon in the stock market. This is price in discreetness, meaning information is not priced in super well and it causes these kinds of movements. Now as far as the reversal, like I said, that's an interesting play here. It doesn't have the broader wind at its back, which is something that I do consider. But",

But when I look at the options chain for something that's fallen down so far, take a look at this. It is 344,000 calls against 328,000 puts. So it literally already has calls skew in terms of OI for something that is literally in freefall. So what this tells me is the market is starting to play the upside. And you can see this also the volume, just the number of transactions today, 78,900 calls transacted against 51,000 puts. So again, people in the options markets are trading this to the upside in a pretty clear way. So if we look at the overall call volume today, 27 were at the offer or above. So those are people that are buying calls. And only 16 were at the bit or below in terms of selling. So yeah, in my opinion, what we're seeing are people buying calls, we see people selling puts. If this were me, that is the initial way that I would play it only because the broad market is not wind at its back. If we had tech still doing really well, I would have no problem playing this with something like a ratio call diagonal. I like",

But again, with the way that the broad market is behaving, I don't necessarily love that. And to me, it looks like first stop in terms of price level would be something around there, 261. If it can get above even this small congestion zone. So this would be the first hurdle to get over in my opinion. And then this would be the next spot that I would be looking at. It's just because there's a big volume node sticking up. So yeah, that's kind of two things wrapped up in a one looking at crowd strike specifically. But then also this idea of trading in reversion place. It's catching off all in knife. You want to wait for a little bit of strength generally speaking again, my approach. But then you have to be kind of careful and have really strong expectations of getting stopped out. There's absolutely really, really high probability of happening. All right.

First, I am really happy to see it literally came down to this 18 handle that I had drawn for a long time ago talking about where I saw essentially the next node of volume. And it essentially hung out right by it and started bouncing up a little bit, which is great to see. Now, I still don't love that this is a lower low. And the other thing that I don't love is just the volume. It's an emek. There's so light volume. Now, it's great that there's a pretty large percentage of by volume that's fantastic. But the problem here is it's not necessarily doing a lot. It's good that this is starting to break up above this handle. This 2021 handle that's huge. But it's not doing it on a lot of volume. So there's not a copious amount of participation going on here. And I think it's important to flag that for people. And it's because with this kind of movement, any sort of strong volume can absolutely start to move this thing because there's such light volume in it, as it says.

And then I want to take a look more specifically at some of those bigger plays that we saw. So right now there's 683,000 calls against 365,000 puts. So this is getting still better, moving closer to the two to one ratio calls to puts. And again, that's just what I typically see more in a bullish configuration. The other thing that you'll find different than what we've typically seen as of late with GameStop is take a look at where the larger volume for calls is. It's not in the front expiration. It's in the next expiration, this 16 of that's where all these blue boxes are. So I've already highlighted this rotation for a while now. I can see it happening essentially real time. But what that implies to me is that this expiration cycle doesn't look like a lot of spiciness is happening. I see 91,000 calls against 39,000 puts. And then in 16,237,000 calls to 100,000 puts. So you can see the we're doing what I would expect to happen, meaning playing the next primary expiration cycle. Now we still see some slightly elevated implied ball in the front. And then in 16, it's down to 105. But overall still, if we move this to the out of the money combined, yeah, that's",

And then in 16, it's down to 105. But overall still, if we move this to the out of the money combined, yeah, that's a really jagged profile. You can see that on the call side, meaning to the upside for the 16, the out of the money calls, they're priced a little bit rich compared to the puts on a relative basis compared to some of these other expiration cycles. So again, what that tells me is just pricing in potential upside moves, which for something like game stop, you have to do because you literally just do not know when it's time for it to make that kind of jump. So what I want to do now is take a quick look at some of these thicker strikes, specifically these 125s I'm assuming, yep, out in 16 aug, there's 39,000 of those now. So if we grab all of these strikes, we go out to these 125s, take a look at that. That's very different. So over yesterday to today, 6,000 of these were closed in terms of net ad net subtract, 6,000 of these contracts accident, which is actually really interesting. And 2,000 of them traded today, I would be very interested to see if this continues to be closing volume versus exposing new grade volume because I'm actually seeing a",

And 2,000 of them traded today, I would be very interested to see if this continues to be closing volume versus exposing new grade volume because I'm actually seeing a lot of general closing volume here, even in the 16 aug expiration cycle, which is kind of interesting. Now here, the 25s are getting super active still with 21,000 OI with 6,000 volume today, and then same thing with these 23s, they're fairly busy. The 20s are holding pretty steady. That's actually really interesting to me. There's 10,000 OI, negative 6, so almost pure balance between yesterday's volume with 37,000 transacted today. That's probably some people taking, I'm guessing, a little bit of profits on the upside move here to unwind where they can. And let's take a quick look, actually we're going to use unusual whales for time and sales. So let me take a quick look through this to see if anything jumps out. I haven't looked at this yet. I just want to see if anything looks really interesting. So 16 aug, 30 aug, 9 aug. So it's a lot of the front explorations I'm seeing. And there's a healthy mix. So I'm seeing a healthy mix of the mid points between bid-ask and I'm seeing sales and buys kind of a little bit of everything. So let's take a quick look at unusual whales. And I",

And I think we'll be able to see a couple things here. So let me slide that out of the way really quick, put that back. And so this is looking at contracts traded from the fifth and this is just the last two days calls inputs. And there's one thing that jumped out of me, which is this series right here, which we're going to talk about. Now up at the top, the other thing I want to highlight is that there was a 278,000 dollar trade in the 20 set, 22 puts at the author. So there's still people buying downside movements here. And you can see it in a pretty big size. Most of the transactions that you see of these larger sizes, right? So I typically will use like a hundred thousand as the cutoff. So think right here, all of these essentially were puts with a block here for 127,000 dollars at the 16 Jan 26, which we're also seeing now. A lot of these build out in these further explorations, which is interesting. Let's take a look at these. We have a series. This is clearly one person because you could take a look at the",

We have a series. This is clearly one person because you could take a look at the execution times. They're all right around one another, they're all the same size. So I would absolutely feel pretty confident saying that this is overwhelmingly likely to be the same person. And it's all the 125s out in 16 Jan 26. They're at the bid. So that means that we're selling puts. And this is an interesting amount of capital. Because if you take a look, this is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, nine blocks. So it's essentially a million dollars of sold premium. And this is generally a bullish trade. You want it to go up. Now if we take a look at modeling this trade so you can see exactly what this looks like. So if we go out here to the 16 Jan 26 is. And we go out here to the 125s. Let's sell these really quick. We grab those analyze that trade, pop into the risk profile so that you can see what it looks like. So you can see that essentially all the way out to expiration.

So let's take a look at this at size. And I wouldn't be surprised if it's 100 if there's another 10 and there somewhere just because that would be more natural human being. See if I can find those really cool. I'm just curious. The 125s. There they are right there. So there's another 20 actually. And these are both at 100 and 5000. And were there any more that came through? Let me recap. That's 1, 2, 3, 4. That's 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Interesting. I wouldn't expect 11. It's kind of just a strange size. Here we go. Here's a couple more. 12. Right. So we have two blocks of 5. 12. That kind of a more natural number, I would say. So let's take a look at what this would look like at 100 and 400. So in the near term, I mean, this is essentially behaving just like long stock. You can see that the total downside for this trade is like 200,000. Nothing catastrophic. And on a daily basis, they",

Now the interesting thing here is they're just not going to collect that much, which I can't help but find interesting. So if I look at the theta that they would get on this on a daily basis at the dollar. So it's just not a lot of money to sell things that far in the money. So this could be some sort of cover put position. So it's kind of the inverse of selling deep in the money cover calls. You can do that essentially on the put side, which is maybe what this is looking like to me. It's hard to tell because you're not selling these to collect a bunch of premium. Even if you get a massive move, right? Like let's say they're expecting by selling these puts and they want it to go above 125. If you think it's going to go to above 125 in this sense, you would make so much more money using calls. So the fact that they're not doing that leads me to believe that this is part of some sort of cover put scenario. I just can't totally see what the other side",
