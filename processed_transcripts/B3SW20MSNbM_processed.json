I'm just gonna have to drop a new link for it really quick. But that's easy. Perfect. All right, so here's the new link. I'm gonna drop it in here, new link. And then I'll put it on X as well. And then we should be good. Yeah, that was weird. A lot of times you can pretty seamlessly run it through another like relay service. But for some reason it didn't like it. So, blockcat. Cool. That'll be all right. Cool, everybody can make their way in as they figure out their lives as I'm trying to figure out my life. Looks like everybody's following over to the other one, which is good. They should all have access to the new link. So we'll pivot over to this one. Beautiful dude. When you use your ears is live. That is correct, sir. Yeah, so we're good. What's poppin, everybody? Yeah, welcome over folks. Sorry for the last minute change. You know how that goes sometimes. Literally had it all set up. I have like a, I don't know, I'd call it like a 15 percent hit rate with trying to go live through zoom. It's not the worst, but it's also not the most seamless. So we figured it out though. What's up, man? Nothing much, man. Just enjoying the year end.",

It's like the most perfect like set up like a couple of months back. Dude, vertical, unbelievable. I did you so dirty because I got in on the 11th of September and I used options on it. I can. I literally think it might be one of my biggest trades. Definitely for the year, but it like might be a multi year period for me because when I got in, it was sub 100. It was like 98. And then I got, yeah, I got out when it was like four. I forgot what it got up to. But as you know, that's not my style of trading at all. So like I didn't deserve that in the least.

This seems like the exact kind of thing that you would find your way into. But yeah, I had originally gotten in here and it was for two very simple reasons. The first one is it started to break out and it was on crazy volume. I didn't know why and I did zero research. I didn't know anything about the earnings.

Now, at a curiosity though, with your general approach, maybe trading view, maybe I should pull that up because this is obviously all messed up from the scale. But where like where in this would your typical entry window be? I mean, you nailed it perfectly. The reason I kind of slipped on this one is just because a good market will have so many nice setups come in your way. So there's a lot of stuff I'll be building into at that time. I see. And so sometimes you already got like a foolish portfolio. And it's like, no, to be honest, like now looking back, it's like home run trade. Sometimes, you know, a lot of people like, I'll tell them it's like, you don't always know, you're buying five, six, 10 stocks.

I recently did a, it was a video actually, think about Palantir, it was about Palantir maybe so far, maybe both of them. And there was a bunch of people on seeking Alpha that we're talking about how it's, you know, no good at this point, it's already overextended, like all that kind of stuff. And I obviously can't help but just find it comical, that exactly to your point stuff that's like that tends to keep being like that. Like, well it just keeps going dude, so whatever. That's about all you really need, I think. Another question about that stock, as I was looking at it out of sheer curiosity, I had, I was using the 10 and the 20, that essentially follow the trend. Now, a lot of other times that I do that for a breakout style trades and kind of momentum following at that point, I find that you really can't take the rules super strictly, otherwise you get chopped out a lot.

    "text": "for a breakout style trades and kind of momentum following at that point, I find that you really can't take the rules super strictly, otherwise you get chopped out a lot. And I noticed that in this case as well. So when you're trying to follow, let's say that you find a good entry on something like this, what's your approach to follow the trend as it's unfolding without getting dumped out? So I try and, and this like really was from William O'Neill, you kind of brought up the concept, but it just slowly just taken over my process. But he had like this thing called the hold rule. So if the stock goes up like so much, like 20 within the first three weeks, it's something you want to hold onto, or that's kind of like the basics of it. But for me, the way it's grown over time is, if the stock is just very strong, it's one of my best stocks, I just don't want to sell it for the first two or three weeks. Because there's always envy of pause, there's gonna be a pullback, like I'll always rather manage risk with the stocks that are not going up. Because yeah, that's a typical thing, right? It'll pull back to a 10, you say it closes below it, you exit and then it just kind of keeps rocking higher three days later. So I found that coming out of a base, coming out of a",

So I found that coming out of a base, coming out of a structure, the first two, three, four weeks is really when the stock is showing what it's got. Like if it's something that's worthwhile holding, if it's worth watching. So I have a bit of like a time clock going on. Like I just, as long as I'm not losing money on a stock, like the first couple of weeks, unless it's like, now there's a really great market. Like if the stock is not doing anything now, maybe just roll it into something else because there's so much heat. But like back in September at markets, we're just like coming out of a bit of a slumber and like all the stocks are starting to move. So whenever you're at the beginning of like that cycle, I find in markets, go like these three, four, five, one cycles. Like that first two, three, four weeks, I just wanna leave it alone, I just don't wanna touch it. So that's usually my pride.

And say with policy or same with GEV, so many others this year that I did trade, ALAB recently, it's the amazing thing about these kind of markets. So like the time's an important consideration. And your average holding duration maybe for this year on some of those names, what's your holding duration? So for me, so it's almost like I have like a split personality. Like I think you need the average, it's not like a proper representation. So there's probably stocks where like the average holding period is like four days, you know, some are a couple of days they can stop, some are like a week and a half they can stop. So like those are the stocks that are like the under performers. And after the ones that do work, like that's a different crowd. That's usually like two to four months.

And I was gonna ask, so like, is a percentage of trades, is it like 50, 50-ish or is it like the one of the four months or usually the rock star moves? But it's probably like, probably like close to like a 35, 65 or something like that, for you know, a 37. Depends on the market. Like in hot markets, it could be near 50, 50, or even better in bad markets. It's like, could be 20, 80 for a little bit, you know? So it depends with the market. And when you're prospecting to enter your trades, I know that you obviously follow an adapted version of CanSlim that you've built and refined over time. One of the things I find so fascinating about CanSlim is that it is a lot of fundamentals that they look at, obviously overlay with technical for timing. But then if you're talking about like a quarter long holding duration, that seems like a shorter window for like fundamentals to fully be reflected. So can you talk about that relationship a little bit? Well, I'll see, so like what I find, like if you could, like the alternate moves",

Well, I'll see, so like what I find, like if you could, like the alternate moves for most of these big winners, and seem like Will and Will Neal speaking of CanSlim or anyone who does this style, like the majority of the full moves of these stocks are let's say 18 months. That's an average full cycle for a stock to do. It's entire move. The thing is though, normally you'll have like a three to five month really hot run, then you'll have like a correction. And the corrections can be 15, they can be 35. So depending on how, like because I'm a more aggressive trader, I'm very concentrated, I tend to be on margin, like you don't want to sit through a 35 correction, like on heavy margins, it's very, very painful. So if I do sit with some stocks, it'll be like the few most I'm looking to kind of capitalize on those individual legs, it's almost like you know, like the different quarters of a football game or something like that, you think a bit, so it's like I try after each quarter, like to reassess like who do I want to stay in or just move the cash and look to kind of rebuild and do it again.

But when I have indicators that will show me that we're stretching the short term, I'll start to kind of buy some, let's say, two, three week put options, a little bit out of the money so the cost is not too much. Because again, kind of like I was saying before, sometimes the corrections are 10. They're like, okay, that's cool. No, it's not a big deal. So that's a 30 or there could be a downgrade. All these girl stocks, like analysts love to downgrade them and it's like they get these big massive hits out of nowhere. So I've found, so I've started to incorporate them more and more to kind of just to smooth out the equity curve. But like, so the way I kind of use it, so basically once you're running up, it's probably different than how you would do it. But like the way I look at it is, what I wanna be totally long, I want the full delta going up. But then after once I get like at an extended point, then I just wanna be like a call option. Like I wanna take more ups. So basically you know, stock with a put, you're like synthetic call basically. So like I just wanna like, I want it, so I still wanna be long, but not a lot all the down side anymore. So I start",

But yeah, the, even stuff that has decent liquidity, you, I find that if there's a really big balance between how far out in time you go to decrease your daily theta, even though there's a higher gross theta, you kind of have to strike a balance because if you go out too far, then you are giving up more and more liquidity, which is a problem.

One of the things I noticed though is, I wanted to pick your brain on the timing of entry. Obviously, that's the name of the game, right? Like that's a difficult part.

Like that was, that's like, that's the reason why you would use a breakout strategy because it's not doing much of anything then boom breaks out and it's done. I found that, I think it's because of HFTs and algals which have become more and more powerful, that's more and more rare to see. You don't see it that way so often. Typically, the big move happens like before the breakout, then you come back in. So I am rarely, like unless it's like something like an APP, like I have a much stronger filter.

And they read the books too. They can see that the retail flow, and I just read that, even pro flow coming on breakouts. And it's like, they're so, they're such an incentive to like push and fade. You know, if they can push enough liquidity to fade it, just that 8, they know all the stops will trigger and then they cover those shorts, and then they can get along and take it up a second time. You know, so over a course of like a few hours or a couple of days, like that's quite a profit. You can do on size if you have the capability to pull it off.

And then, yeah, front run or away from the confirmation, I'd rather pay a little bit higher and then build an after, then like try and go with the stop order. Like you miss something like an APP sometimes. It's a real hard one to miss, but a lot of times, it's like, it gets very, and it's a good market. Like it in a choppy market, it's like 10X the chop, you know, like everything's failing. So it's, it can get tricky. Yeah, that leads to the, to the follow on actually, is that I've even noticed in the last couple of weeks that stuff seems to have slowed down, not a ton, but I'm not seeing as many things that are popping up that are looking quite as promising. Have you seen that or you're just looking at different stuff? Well, I think it's because most stocks have been correct. I mean, like if you look at the, it's not just like the small cast, but if you look at like yes and P500, the SPY versus the RSP, RSP is like equal weights at SP 500.

So it's like always kind of like, they promise the gift and they can't pull it back. So like at some point they'll get a massive tailwind. There'll be some not-performance, but you know, at the same time, as an institution, it's usually you go to a small cap for high growth. And that's the way I usually think, you know, small, even I prefer mid caps.

The only thing that made sense to me is, I think there's been a big trade on where, it's like your large, your long large caps, short small caps, like a market neutral approach. And every time there's like the hope of more aggressive rate cuts, which is more bullish in short term, like you know, in theory, small caps, it's like that, that trade goes and reverse. It goes one point this summer, where it's like literally the QQQ and the Russell were trading completely inversely to each other. Yeah. Like if the Russell was up 2, the Qs were down 1 and vice versa. So I think that trade got pushed to the every few years, there's like a trade that takes over. It was the carry trade at one point.

What are you doing that kind of a trade at? And suddenly everyone has the same trade on because it's making money. So I think everyone gets on one side of the trade. And so you're seeing basically all those pops are the fear moments where, why gotta get out of this trade? And the small caps are less liquid. So it's like they're all trying to do it at the same time and then it's put back on. So I think you're just seeing yet with a curve of like the guys who are putting on this long short triple Qs or Russell or whatever. And that's only to me that explains it because overall the advance, if you just look at let's say a 50 day moving average, it's up to the right. But the moves are like you're up 12? Where is it? You're up at which doesn't make any sense. So it's definitely some kind of liquidity driven strategy, move that's coming off and on. Yeah, and that's the part that I find so",

So it's definitely some kind of liquidity driven strategy, move that's coming off and on. Yeah, and that's the part that I find so fascinating by because I was looking at it for a little while and like the Russell was flat for a long, long part and then all of a sudden it was starting to catch up to the SP 500. They weren't that far apart. They were like five, six points apart. And then they've obviously decoupled now where it spies up almost what like 30 and Russell's like sub 20 still. Yeah, that's why I think I have a feeling going to your end you'll probably get like a catch up move. So we'll see what happens. But it's been it's been wild to see I agree. And if you're at the perfect example if you're a breakout trader, like that's a painful advance. You know, you look back and it's still out of your pants where you're saying what I just lost money the entire time. I bought it or something. I felt out of it. And it's like you know, you want to like hit something but that's why I was a bit of balance on the entries and whatnot. But it's been a definitely been a wild charge for sure. Yeah.

Because I feel like if that's the only thing somebody does, you just have to be a glutton for punishment. You just have to be okay, getting kicked in the shin over and over again until you get your couple home runs. Like a really anytime I run the strategies, it's like the win rate is typically okay. It'll still hover around like 60, which is a decent win rate. But there's still a lot of losing trade. It's 40 of trades losing is not good. Yeah. You know what? I think it goes back to like I said before markets were so much simpler. Like people didn't have the knowledge they had. So a lot of these strategies, like I mean, will you know, we'll start trading in the 50s, the 1950s. You know what I mean?

Whatever makes you happy. Well, sometimes you know, it's interesting, but one thing I thought that was gonna be stronger was cybersecurity. Like you would think with the AI revolution and that, you know, there'd be an, an emphasis on like stopping fakes into this and that. So that was like an early, theme I was putting on early in the year that didn't kind of like come to fruition.

What I think, again, well, my kind of like base case that I've been trying to follow was like the internet rule out the 90s where, you know, it wasn't just, you know, people making mainframe computers that dominated, it was, it was first, it was like, you know, routers and switches and ethernet cables. Then that went to internet portals, then I went to browsers, then I went to mobile phones. So it's like everything built on itself.

You know, and how it's going to be the next player. I think your point on semiconductors is massive, because I think that that caught a lot of us off guard. The fact that they've hailed off, literally as a sector, quite as hard as it did. And that also seems, I can't fully tell what that's driven by. It's not like demand for semiconductors is going to go away, even now that we're talking about just more computing, being required for everything. Beyond AI, but now we have this new emergence of quantum computing with Willow and Google that's been worked on for 12 years. Now that's starting to gain some traction. So when you think about a sector like semiconductors, what are your thoughts on it? You think that this is just profit taking for people that are got in super low, Scrooge McDuck in it, swimming in gold coins, or like it just seems like the demand is and actually contracting that. It goes back here to the question, like we were saying how long do you stay in these stocks? Because the market exaggerates the way up and exaggerates the way",

So like when you're on the way up, like for example, not pounded, like I had a great traded pound here. I got in like 20s, I exited like in the 70s, which was a great trade. But like even have some clients say, like why are you selling pound here? Well like look, it is trading like at 65 times sales. Like I always say, I wish I could start any company and sell it at 65 times just my sales for the year. Like I'll sell at a year one, it's gone. You know, like think about it. Like 65 years should now be dead. I can get all of those sales like done now, you know? Like that value. So the thing is it's like I love pound. I think pound here is in such a unique spot, like in the AI ecosystem. But like, you know, look, I mean, the market will just get ahead of itself on the way up. Then it has to, so at some point, you know, like pound here is gonna correct or make a base and it'll be, you know, it'll work again. But also sometimes like with the",

It's like, especially as an investor, we tend to be generalists. Like I mean, like I was saying it half-joking, but it's true, like you really, do you personally understand the difference between, you know, an Intel chip or AMD chip and Nvidia chip, like really down to what makes one so much better than the other, like sometimes it's hard to understand what these guys even do, you know, so. So that's the way I look at it. And that's why, you know, those drops, doesn't ruin the stock, but it does give you a chance.

Like the people who do know, the people who do make the semis or the institutions where they're specialists and semiconductors, like they know AMD is gonna be beat. And this one's gonna be the winner. So that's why to me, Relta strength is so critical, especially on pullbacks. It's a great way to phrase it. When you see all these new policies coming out from our boy Trump, you know, he's just out there, heckling, slinging tariffs, the comedy show is back. And so it's awesome. Anytime I have a chance to listen to that dude talk, there's a zero percent chance I miss it because it's freaking hilarious.

Sorry, I didn't mean to cut off your trade thought. No, that's like the exact kind of talking. So with that back in terms of introducing policy and stuff, it seems like there's a lot of new changes coming down the pike. We're seeing deregulation likely in the financial sector. We're seeing oil and gas probably coming back in a vogue. We're seeing EV credits probably going away. Like a lot of things I see that really stick out to me, but what are your thoughts? And I always love listening to a Canadian talk about this stuff because I have to be honest, I don't know shit about what your prime minister has talked about recently, but everybody knows what's going on. He doesn't know what he's been talking about ever. So it's okay, don't worry about it.

What I really like about Trump, the return of the Trump, is that I think especially having a guy like Elon Musk, which, I mean, sometimes some people, like my brother-in-law's, he teaches finance at a university, and his colleague is on the other side of the political spectrum. Like she really just doesn't like Musk and Trump and all that. And so she's saying, he's like, you know, he's not even that good of a businessman. And he was like, he's maybe possibly very likely the best businessman like he if you don't like his politics, you can't say he's a bad business person. I mean, he's what, he's 50s, and he's like probably gonna be the first trillionaire. Anyways, so what I like about Trump version two, better than one, is I think there's better economic guidance.

If you don't have a domestic alternative, well yeah, then the whole cost of the tariff basically gets passed onto the consumer. So like, I mean, I don't think it's gonna be like blanket tariffs and all the rest. So like I'm more optimistic that it's a pro business climate, that's a deregulation climate. If you look at any country in the world, I always tell people, like it's like, like I'm in that sense, I'm the least racist person in the world. I always tell people it's like, everyone can have incredible success. Like China was horrible in the 90s. They started these free markets, small cities, and they boomed like East West Germany. West Germany was amazing. East Germany was terrible because one was communist, one was cap. So it's like, you know, like just get those foundations there.

This is the first time where I think like white-collar people are probably more like at risk, because if I think if you're a manual laborer, it works to your benefit, like it's very hard to kind of replace someone who lays tiles in a house or something like that or in a building. So I think that's gonna be tricky, which like people haven't experienced.

The 2025 key themes that you have in mind, if you were to pick a few of them on how you're interpreting what kind of things you wanna get into, you wanna eyeball, you wanna position into for 2025. What are those? To me, one of the top is autonomous driving. I think it finally can come to fruition. And if you saw just recently GM pull their crews like autonomous driving program.

So, for me, that's one of the big ones is autonomous driving. And everything really, to me, it's like an AI centric play, but the thing is, I don't know how it's all gonna play out. Like, new names come up, like, Estara Labs came out. And they try and like speed up how like data transfers and all the rest. And so, it's like just being awake, I think one of the themes that we're gonna have to, that will be big is new IPOs, new young companies. It's been a very frozen IPO market. Yeah. Tie that in with like the regulation and the better market I expect to see a lot more of that coming. So, I think just being on the lookout for every company in every industry, like in Fintech, I'm really focused on Fintech, like Lenders with a backdrop of falling interest rates and now like better models. I think they can have a huge upside move. Upstart is a stock I've been on for a while. They were big like last cycle and they got creamed with all that, but they've been coming back. They've",

They were big like last cycle and they got creamed with all that, but they've been coming back. They've been doing great. And it's interesting I was reading like the company reports and they were saying like, over the past two years, while everyone hated on the stock, they improved their models, not more than expected. They improved their models more than they thought was possible. Like I think like up to 90 of their process is fully automated. Like start sprinkling on even more AI capability and data processing, that's huge. So, I thought I was driving everything AI and how that's gonna leak through to things like Fintech are like my big focus is going to 2025. What about cryptocurrency, Bitcoin? I think that's, I know that cryptocurrency might not be your direct impact, but it seems like there's a lot of things in Fintech that are gonna be able to play the game that seems to be a massive, massive initiative. Like I like Bitcoin. Like I think Bitcoin is, it's hitting critical mass to a point where it's like keeps snowballing itself higher. But to me, I feel like everything else crypto related hasn't found the right product market Fint. Like they're trying to make crypto do things that, there's like, you know, I like",

It's best though. As it goes up, then I'll borrow more money and I'll buy more stocks and the stocks will go up even more. Like yeah, it's all stocks go up. It's a great strategy.

They're going to come up with different tiers. I'm sure. Yeah. Well, I think almost everybody paid. Everyone has their main car. How many people have a second car that they're paying 5, 6, 8 a month for, which they're barely using. But those two times where it saves you the 45 minutes to walk to a store, I mean, you're paying for that. And that convenience for that time, why wouldn't you pay 200 if it could maybe save you time, even make you more effective and help you make more money at what you're doing? I would easily, I'd get, I'd pay 1,000 a month if it's something that could help me be productive enough. I mean, why don't you pay for Bloomberg terminals? 3,000 a month because it allows them to be extra productive with their trading. I mean, it's 100 that would do it. Yeah, definitely, man. As always, it is an absolute pleasure hanging out. Like I told you, we can talk a little bit more, but I'd love to set up something like maybe monthly or something like that, just to both should see what's going on in the world. Because it's always a pleasure. You balance me",

Because it's always a pleasure. You balance me out. You're a nice person. I'm not. So it's good to, it's good to find my way around good people. It helps reform me, I think. So thanks for hanging out, man. Anytime, man, always a pleasure. For anybody that wants to get a hold of Matt, you can go to his website. I think that's the main landing page for you now, right? Crusoe and Sexta.com. That's right. I'm calm, yeah. I'm also on YouTube. I've been trying to get some bit different videos out. I'll go through it. So inside there as well, we're on X trader on this, we're on Kuroso. Beautiful. And then on X, do you, X or do you tweet? What do you do on there? I try and be promise. I'll say I access that. I just don't know what we've, if we've moved from tweeting to Xing. Is the Xing is weird, right? Like tweeting makes sense. It's supposed to be posting. I think the official term is it's a post now set up a tweet, the official term. Literally did not know that. That makes way more sense.
