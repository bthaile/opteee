    "text": "zero DTE SPX spreads. These are a strategy I've tested for a really long time and here are three super common mistakes when it comes to them and some ways we can overcome them. What's up everybody? Eric here. Welcome back to all the outliers and we were talking about a super common strategy today. A lot of people I know like to trade the strategy myself included but there are some really really common errors people make. So first let's get a quick baseline on what this strategy is the zero DTE SPX strategies. There's a ton of different forms and fashions of them. Sometimes people will trade short strangles. Sometimes they will trade short straddles. Sometimes short iron condors that are far out of the money. So on and so forth there's a lot of variations and I'm not going into all of them what I do want to talk about today are some of the more common variations and the issues with them. So one of the most common variations I've seen is essentially a short wide far out of the money iron condor. So what that looks like is if I come over to the trade tab I typically would see a zero DTE obviously it's the weekend right well not obviously you would know that I know that today's the 23rd of October it's Sunday. So there's no zero DTE right now but normally there would be. So let's just pretend that this one DTE",

So let's just pretend that this one DTE is actually zero DTE we would pop this open and then a lot of people go super far out of the money for the short option. So let's start with the put side and let's say we go to this 10 delta far out of the money short put and then you would buy an even further out of the money long put essentially to create a hedge now there's a couple big issues with this the first one is the use of spreads in my opinion is an inefficient way to trade the strategy what is this strategy anyways why do we trade it in short what we're attempting to do is harvest the volatility risk premium and what that means is if I zoom in on a slightly shorter time period and we look down at this weird look in series of lines I am charting out implied volatility versus historic volatility that is the entire purpose of the zero DTE strategies is we are attempting to trade the typical overstatement of implied volatility to historic volatility.

The big problem is if you're trading a spread okay we're selling the volatility in this 10 delta short put but then we're buying the very same volatility that we think is overpriced that's the first problem people are uncomfortable taking risk so they seek to hedge out this risk using spreads like this and that is an issue because you are literally contradicting the entire trade hypothesis that you're starting with now to be abundantly clear that is not this is suggest that all spreads like this vertical spreads or condors are immediately contradictory in nature for some people they will use that far out of the money wing just as a way to hedge black swan risk no problem if we want to do that let's use some data to inform our decision cycle and what I mean by that is maybe we only do it on the put side because markets tend to move down much lower far more aggressively than they do to the upside so if that's our concern instead of just automatically doing some sort of condor maybe we only do it on the put side where the risk",
