    "text": "Another really uncomfortable truth about options trading. If you ask the question, is blank return possible? Or can I make blank number of dollars on blank amount of money? The answer is no. Unequivically no. If you have to ask the question, the answer is no. Now, joking aside, if you're thinking of it more from like what's possible, the range of possibilities are huge. And both to the benefit and detractor for most people, it's going to be entirely dependent on you. So while somebody might say yes, extra-turn as possible or not possible, that might be their reality. It doesn't necessarily express as yours. Now you can do yourself a favor and look at what averages look like. That can help you a lot. But if you have to ask the question, is blank return possible at that point in time for you? It's not. Because once you have a track record with trading, you now know what you, the individual, are capable of. Until then, you have no idea. Be an all-air.",
