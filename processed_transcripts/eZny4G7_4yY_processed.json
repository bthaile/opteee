    "text": "at analyst recommendations analyst revisions all of those sorts of things so for some really important deeper information on market concepts technical analysis and fundamental analysis i have videos in the description i share my top five technical analysis tools and my top five fundamental analysis tools that if i was starting over again i would focus on those first now the last thing don't get sucked into this stupid-ass argument of is technical analysis better than fundamental analysis or vice versa it's as a retail trader we're at the very end of the information spectrum you should use everything at your disposal to make the best possible decisions you will start to understand what makes the most sense for your trading style for me i weight technical and fundamental analysis differently based on what i'm doing so you'll start to understand a little bit more about that as you practice different strategies perfect segue into strategies in my opinion anybody who's interested in actively trading should absolutely take a look at options i have an entire playlist on options it's a little dated so i apologize for that but i'll link to that in the video description anyways because i think there's still some good information in there plus you'll get to see me in my early youtube days which is kind of hilarious more importantly i want to give again specific direction on where i would start the very first thing is the coverage strangle the second thing",
