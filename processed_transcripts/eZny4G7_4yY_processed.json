    "text": "What's up everybody? Eric here. Welcome back to all the outliers. It is back to the basics today. I want to run through how I would start trading if I were to start all over again. And really I built this to have a conversation with a family member. So this is kind of the no frills, no BS, no fluff breakdown on what I think is truly important to get started early. And then obviously there's just a tremendous amount of information that we accumulate over time. So this is kind of the minimal viable product in my opinion. And to get started successfully, specifically is it pertains to the markets in general analysis and then also some option strategies. The other thing I want to know is at the end of the video, I'm going to go through four steps. So I'm going to break down everything we go over in the first part of the video into four actionable steps on what I would be looking to do in how I want to do it. So let's jump over and get right to it. The very first thing is I'm going to be linking to a bunch of supporting videos because we're not going to go super far into detail on all the concepts I bring up because the video would never end. So with that, I'm not going to link them via cards just because there's going to be too many of them. They're going to",

So that's where you can find them as I mentioned them. So let's start with kind of this general orientation section, the very first thing that I think anybody, especially again, my family member that's looking to start trading needs to sort out is this they need to define their goals. Why are they trying to do this and then get their savings in order. This is finance basic financial management 101, but you do not want to start investing or even more so trading money that you need in the next three to five years. And it's because there's a lot of volatility and I mean, let's be honest. So you might suck at it and you might lose it. So we have to accept that risk, but it's easier to accept that risk and operate with that.

So a favorite saving saying of mine is from Stephen Covey's seven successful have seven habits of highly successful people is begin with the end in mind. And that really ties to both of these. The reason why I think it's so important is because if you want to start trading, you can get pulled in countless different directions. There's going to be tons of information that's thrown at you all different points in time, but some of it might be useful. Some of it might not you might be interested in it and want to learn about it later. But if you begin with the end of mind, you know what you're working towards. You can always pull yourself back onto the right path. So you're not going down this random rabbit hole about implied volatility surface calculations. If you don't even need to trade options or if it's not something you're interested in not saying that I think it's fascinating. I think it's cool for most people to check out, but to make sure that we're not getting inundated and overwhelmed and essentially paralyzed by the amount of information. I think this is extremely important. And it's also going to help you feed what your risk approach is going to be.

So the very first video I'm going to link to is this right here, and that is in the video description below. The next one, some general resources, obviously YouTube is one of them. That's where this video is going to be available to you. But then also I have the discord that I run. It's completely free. It's the outlier trading dojo. And it's just like minded people who want to become an outlier, who want to become financially successful. And we know in order to do that, statistically speaking, you have to be an outlier. So we're working towards that or working to maintain that. I also host live sessions. And again, that's available to you and everybody else who's interested. So the live sessions right now, their Mondays, but then I also do trading workshop once a month with the outlier community. I do one-on-one giveaways on Twitter the first of the month for 45 minute conversation. Obviously you just hit me up whatever I'll talk to you, but for anybody else listening, this will be useful.

I think these two are probably two of the greatest starting points because you can get what you need. And then kind of distill through that information. Again, don't get stuck in analysis paralysis because there's 96 websites. You bookmarked that all look interesting to you, but you can't make any progress because you're overwhelmed. Because there's too many start with those two. Now the last thing is I do think leveraging the community is super important, but I think this has served me very well, especially with the trading mentor I've told you all about.

So look for direction, look for help, but understand that you're going to come across people who aren't going to want to help you. Now, when I think about communities that are helpful, I think about places where anonymity is limited. So places like Twitter can be useful if it's a name to count. I'm relatively new on there and I enjoy it. I also think places like the YouTube comments is another decent place. Reddit is a good place, but you have to understand Reddit is brutal. People are completely anonymous on there and you will find the worst versions of human beings in those settings, especially in the trading community, especially in the finance community, people typically aren't nice. So you're going to have to grow from thick skin, which is a good life skill anyways. All right, so let's move on now down to some conversations about the markets quickly. What are the markets?

In short, the markets are built of exchanges, things like the nicey, the New York stock exchange, which you likely have heard before places like that. And they provide access to securities. There are different kinds of securities. There's a couple major buckets. We have equities debt derivatives. Technically, there's another one over here called hybrids, which we're not going to get into because it doesn't matter for the conversation right now. But for equities, think stocks, individual stocks and companies, you've heard that before, that is what equities are. There's also ETFs that can be considered in there, things like that. That is bonds, CDs, things of that nature. It's essentially something where money was loaned and it's going to get paid back with interest. And then derivatives. This is what I do. I've talked to you about this before, which is derivatives being options and futures. So these are contracts that their value is derived from something else. So we'll get into a little bit more about some general market concepts down here, but it's really important to note that the markets are large. There are a ton of players in it and we make up retail traders make up a small part of that. Okay, we need a brokerage account. Essentially, this is the middleman. You need them.

You need them. As, you know, Tim or John or Eric, I directly cannot access individual stocks on the stock market. So I need a broker. The brokerage service does that for you. They provide you access in exchange for commissions. So a lot of brokerage, they will advertise free commissions on stocks, which is typically bullshit because it's going to be captured in order routing and anyways, which we'll get into via another video. But more importantly, don't skimp out on your brokerage places like Robinhood have just so many people who thought it was the greatest thing because it was attractive and gamified. Investing and trading, but then when you really need market support when things are volatile things aren't going well, bid asks spreads liquidity is going out the door places like Robinhood become crippled, whereas larger established brokerage firms don't have quite that same level of impact. So again, giving general feedback would be shop around and I have a video in the in the description below that you can see how we can shop around some things to look for.

I'm not sponsored by them or anything I literally randomly pick them when I was starting in high school and I just have like them, they have good platform, good trading platform. So I stuck with them, but don't skimp out here. Next thing portfolio risk management. So I have a couple videos again in the description below that talks about both of these when we think about portfolio management your very first job is you are a risk manager. Most people start trading thinking that they're going to be there to make money make fat stacks, make a pool of gold coins like scrooge McDuck that you can jump in and dive and swim through all your money. But the problem is you're not going to get there if you don't have an account because you blew it up. So the very first thing is learning risk management and what goes into that understanding the relationship between risk and reward. Here's the punchline you've heard this before if something seems too good to be true. It probably is sometimes in the markets there will be something that's mispriced or there truly will be a gift in the markets, but it is so rare.

There's like no risk here, but great reward. You're probably not looking at it right risk and reward are intimately tied to one another when we want to accept or pursue greater reward. We are going to inevitably accept higher risk. So you got to find the balance that works for you. Speaking of finding that balance, let's talk about how we should first get started. In my opinion, what I would do if I was starting all over again is I would establish a buy and hold portfolio to be working in the background while I was paper trading to learn. So I have a video in the description below on the best buy and hold portfolio. I think exists. You literally can set it up in less than seven minutes and it no shit outperforms the market. So it's a no brainer to me. It's something that I would do in the background because unless you are looking to trade for income.

If you can't beat your buy and hold portfolio via trading, you're not going to make money faster. You're going to make money slower. So I think it's prudent to have that working in the background while you learn the skill set, make all the stupid mistakes. We all make make it via paper trading. Make your trade plan built out so that you have an idea where you're starting so that you're not pissing away money unnecessarily while you're learning. If you hear people say, oh, paper trading stupid, it's not real money, all that kind of stuff. They're right. It's not real money. But if you can't take paper trading seriously, you've already identified a much larger problem that is going to plague you through your entire trading career, which is a discipline issue. If you do not have discipline, you will not be successful trading.

We make up very small amount of order size. And at the end of the day, we are small fish swimming with big fish that are known as institutions. So institutions are things like banks, hedge funds, pensions. They are very large groups of money. And there are plenty of other market players out there that classifies institutions, high frequency trading firms, market makers, all those kinds of things. Again, to not get too sucked down a rabbit hole. It's just important to note that we are essentially the small fish. We get information as retail traders, the very last, but overall, there's still enough space in the market for us to make money as well. Now, when we talk about market efficiency, there's all different kinds of hypothesis out there. And one of the first pieces of homework would be good for you to do is go over here to invest a pdf and look up the efficient market hypothesis. It's a really useful concept to understand.

But essentially, there's different forms that data and information permeates throughout the markets, according to the efficient market hypothesis. Again, the punchline here is the markets in my opinion are not purely efficient. We find instances where there are inefficiencies, which leaves us room to develop edge to make money. Edge is super important to our ability to make money long term. There are lots of different ways you can find or create edge, but it's important to note that edge doesn't necessarily remain consistent. It changes over time, the market changes. So we are continually looking for different styles that meet our objectives that can find and develop edge in the marketplace. Now, down to analysis technical analysis is essentially when we're looking at charts, and we're trying to use the information we see on charts to develop ideas on what we're looking at. We're looking at the charts to develop ideas on where things are going to go. Fundamental analysis is when we're looking at the qualitative and quantitative aspects of a company. We're looking at earning statements. We're looking at products. We're looking at leadership. We're looking at analyst recommendations, analyst revisions, all of those sorts of things.

So we have something to start with, define our objectives and begin our research using those resources I shared. Then we need to find a brokerage account, open up the account, open up a margin account, ideally, don't forget you can do this for your IRAs. That's what I do. But you got to get something opened up in order to get access to the markets. Then we need to put some money in there and set up that buy and",

Then we need to put some money in there and set up that buy and hold portfolio. Step four is begin paper trading some of those option strategies that I shared while you're building out your trading plan in your trade logs, which again, I have links in the video description below for you to check those out. And then before you choose to go live with whatever you're practicing paper trading, validate those results. Do they make sense? Meaning are you beating? Are you able to beat your buy and hold portfolio? The answer to that is no, then you either need to keep paper trading to develop your skill set so that that is the case or you should be paper trading something that's designed more for income, because that's the only other reason. If you're trying to trade, but you can't outperform the market would be for income or to reduce risk, but that all comes with defining your objectives early on. So that's exactly what I would do.
