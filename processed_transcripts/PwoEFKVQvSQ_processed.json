I can tell you offline. For sure. So try to stay anonymous. It's like PB good. Like for because Peruvian Bulls are mouthful to say each time. Yeah, yeah, no, PB Peruvian Bull. Like if you just say bull, that's fine. Yeah, no, all the above are totally fine with me. Beautiful. Well, I came across some of your work from actually my community. So just to give you like some super, super quick background. Long time trader been doing this my whole adult life from 33 now. And I came across GameStop long time ago based on some of its initial movements, right? Because I'm a derivatives trader. So things that exhibit volatility. I'm going to be there like, you know, a moth to light because we're looking for volatility. It's how we make money. So I traded GameStop for a little bit. And then this most recent resurgence. I was trading it again. But this time I already had the YouTube channel started. So then I was like realizing that there's a lot more to this than I originally realized. I didn't understand the story behind it. I didn't understand the different players. I literally was just trading it previously. So anyways, long story short, started a series where I was looking closer at GameStop",

Like I've been trading my whole life and it just completely differently than everything else. So I cannot help but be fascinated. Then you throw in a character like the cat who you look at him. And this dude's losing 200 million dollars in a day. And he doesn't care at all. Like everything related to like logical trade management. It's not there. So it's like it's nuts. So I became infatuated with it. And then my audience, they were like, yo, do you know this dude? Because he looks at some of this stuff too. And I was just like, oh, perfect. I'm looking to talk to everybody I can. I met with Richard Newton a little bit. He and I did a couple live streams. And I text with him about the madness that is GameStop. But that's how I came across you. And I'm absolutely stoked to chat with you about it, man. Yeah. No, thanks for having me on. I've been involved with the community, you know, since January of 2021.

And that is, you know, what you mentioned right there is the key point that I think most people do not get is that GME is not like the others. You know, it is a, it is a complete anomaly in terms of, you know, trying to trade and understand its pricing movements. Like it doesn't follow the normal laws of supply and demand. And that's what has has changed people to use on the financial system and made people realize that there's a lot of stuff going on beneath the surface with regards to stock lending, you know, settlement plumbing options derivatives that doesn't normally occur with other stocks. So yeah, it's, it's an incredible journey. And I think if you the deeper you go down the game top right the whole the deeper you'll realize, you know, how little you understand about the stock market because this thing is a behemoth. And there's a lot of skeletons in the closet.

And I try to explain to them, I was like, the most interesting thing I find about GameStop in like the ape community, which I continue to reiterate like I view myself as a guest, right, because I'm I traded it for a while, but I don't know anything half of what long standing people in the community know and I respect it. But one of the most intricate like intricate details about GameStop is how involved the ape community has gotten with all these small tiny nuanced concepts that you can ask the majority of traders like my friends who've been trading as long as I have. They don't know shit about it and it's because like from a trading perspective, it doesn't impact us directly. So it's offered me a completely new lens to learn more about this world that I'm obsessed with, which is trading, right? It's what I do.

And instantly I'm led to the DD, which is all this older post it from, you know, I'd say fall of 2020 and even before discussing why game stop is a massive value play and why this stock is over short. And as this talk begins to rise right through early 2021 through this, you know, second and third week of January, you know, I'm working in this in an office building with all the other financial analysts and and valuations managers and CPAs.

And then you see the large shorts like Citron research, for example, a bear traps or bear traps style publisher. He comes out and he's just like this thing's going to to 5 you guys are all retarded you don't understand short interest like this thing's going back to zero. And the stock keeps rising right past 20 into 30 40 50. And on the Friday of it was the 20 21st of January, we see the stock price rip up into like 50 and then get slammed down to 30 and then close at 40.

Oh yeah you know it's in the 70s yeah I well I think oil broadly is a you know indicator of of economic strength right and so and it also is an indicator of of you know how in my opinion of a political desire to lower inflation so whenever they join the SPR and they lower oil prices oil get lower gas prices to me it's a political move and I think that there's no. There's no doubt that are doing this before the election to help secure you know democratic vote because they want to make the incumbent look better so my opinion if I would a guess on oil prices although I don't follow them as much as I used to far to guess I'd imagine we're going to remain range bound because they're going to try to increase production especially domestically in the US until the election. Yeah I was surprised that they didn't already announce it to be honest as soon as I started so it start rolling into the high 60s I thought for sure they were going to uncork it but yeah let's see maybe they're just a little slow to the punch here.

All life savings going to something like just getting a scale of how that looks. Sure so I had a large out of large portfolio invested in large at least you know in my in my in my view wasn't wasn't make less than 50,000 or less than 30,000 total but yeah I because at that point I'd only just started working because I had trouble getting a job during the pandemic but I was mostly in actually gold stock prior to GME. Gold miners and I bought a bunch of leaps on those and so I liquidated some of those positions and so by the end of January as probably half GME and half Gold stocks but a large part of that was also because of appreciation right because I started buying in at like maybe like 80 and then the price was at like 300 400 so yeah at a certain point I think",

Yeah got it interesting because that's one of the things I find so interesting about people who trade GameStop in different ways because my portfolio turnover is exceedingly high right I'm trading so most of my stuff might hold for like a couple weeks so that's why I asked that question is because it's interesting to understand the dynamics of do we let it grow and consume more and more the portfolio do we cut it down move it to other things. They also think that that reflects a lot of the conviction which it sounds like you were still pretty strongly convicted with the direction it was going. Absolutely yeah I mean like them turning off the buy button was the answer that that was the answer the question we had we thought can this thing below the financial system and the answer was yes they had to shut off the buy button for a reason because it literally was doing that.

They restrict and then they restrict buying for the next week and a half all this media you know fun comes out they tell us that retails dying they've tapped all their savings we're all going into silver it's over the reddit crowd is crazy they shut down the discord there's a community discord for Wall Street bets and then they even have talks about suing reddit for market manipulation etc and over the next few weeks of early February of 2021 the stock price just tanks and it goes all over the market. And it goes all the way back down to like I think it's like 40 at one point and everyone said like all the traders who like day traders who said like look this is just a squeeze it's over",

So it got like I mean again these are moves you never see in another stock you know. So the funny part that you mentioned about the moves that you don't see in other stocks I back literally way back in like the mid 2010s I had started buying data from SIBO so that I could test ideas and this is you know a little bit old school compared to what you can do now. Every time that I would test different ideas from like an option trading perspective understanding how things work in different size companies. Whether it works differently in indices ETF stuff like that and every single time that I would get like these weird returns in the strategies there is a handful of names that kind of became the usual suspects and in the beginning you know it was minor deviations yada yada yada and then all of",

So it's funny that you guys picked up on very much of that same anomalous movement now one other question I had for you and then we can kind of pivot to some of you know what the chat wants us to talk about they have a couple questions about like swaps and stuff like that. But just another general question for my own understanding one of the things I find so fascinating about the the ape community is I find there to be like a broken a broken approach just in terms of methodology and again this is like from a pure pure trading perspective so a lot of people they talk about mo as we're like wanting to see like this really big squeeze I understand that the part that I don't fully understand is that most of them when I kind of will be able to do that.",

But but if you hold it all the way through then you don't make money right you still have the same so then to me it almost sounds like it's like a value play right because if we're thinking long term holdings we're thinking long term price accumulation accumulation but there's so much focus on the squeeze I don't get that so to summarize all of that. Why is there the emphasis on the squeeze but then the traders don't have like an exit strategy during the squeeze why is that.

F. E. tweeted at the end of the at the close of business day a close of market like his update and he hadn't sold a share and everyone was just like holy shit like this guy it's it's another.

Discussing the 2008 financial crisis and how it had affected us and they said this is one of our chances to get these people and with them shutting off the buy button people were furious and people started buying GME we saw people who had no money who their last 200 bucks they bought some GME and they said I'm doing this not. You know not for any like profit reason but because my brother committed suicide because he lost his home in 2008 or my uncle was investment bank or lost his job lost everything and he went into depression for for 10 years like there's all these personal sources are spreading so people said you know we're not sell were never selling like if they're never if they're going to pull",

So there's a there's documentable evidence from all the large brokers that market makers hedge funds and then the banks themselves have been engaging in predatory naked short selling practices and this has been by the way this has been going on for decades there's a court case in 2005 that was brought before that went all the way up to a Supreme court that actually forced a lot of public attention on this and it also forced congressional hearing. So there's a lot of things which made the SEC implement reg show and they created the threshold list showing like how many days stock has been overshorted and if it's more than I think it's 1 of the float. Oh no if it's FTD if it was 1 of the float is FTDing for 5 trading days consecutively you get put on the threshold list and so all these implementations got put in place in the early to mid 2000s because this was known to be an issue I mean there was CMK diamonds there was um oh there's another one there's an investor by the name of global links Richard Simpson or Robert I think",

I'm not broke into account and no and and by the way yeah and and actually I should he didn't own all of the own 111 of the float so he owned more than all of them so he was like how is it possible that literally the entire like multiples of the flow is trading when I own the whole thing and I'm not trading it with anybody.

And also obviously putting the disability of the US stock market at risk and so that's when GME started to switch into almost like a you know active investigation and some people just became curious and learning as much as they could about the stock market and the plumbing and that's when we got brought Dr. Tion and Adam it has a series which I don't know if you're familiar with that stuff but yeah we went really deep into the plumbing and we found out a lot of shady shit.

Offshoot here that grabs this other interesting thing and then this off shoot over here that grabs this other interesting thing when you think about like the broader case for GameStop right like the the main thing not going off all the offshoot the tentacles but like the main case for GameStop just in terms of a company and its viability it's future what you view that as as it sits today. So I would say there's actually two large aspects of this right obviously you know the first is the short sweet document so you know GameStop again this is where we start to get into maybe controversial territory because someone who's looking at short interest today will say the short interest sits at 22 or 28 or whatever is that. And I would say sure that's what the reported short interest is but if you followed GameStop back in 2021 you remember seeing finra data showing 140",

    "text": "territory because someone who's looking at short interest today will say the short interest sits at 22 or 28 or whatever is that. And I would say sure that's what the reported short interest is but if you followed GameStop back in 2021 you remember seeing finra data showing 140 short interest and then they found out during that week of the last week of January 2021 that 140 was the technical limit that they were that finra was allowed to report short and other people found other brokers reporting 220 short interest and 315. So we quickly realized and that combined with some volumetric data and just the you know the amount of FTDs on the stock were like holy shit they probably shorted multiples of the float and there's basically no way to close this position and the you know the argument that other traders had for years right was well or maybe not years but for most of 2021 most people who are skeptical of GameStop were saying look. Yes, there was a huge overbilled of short interest that short interest was evaporated with in the run from 10 to 300 400 it's all over you guys miss it. Just any that is crazy right in the run from 10 to 300 400 dollars sorry it just the numbers sometimes when we talk about this stuff it never escapes me how fucking crazy that that in and of itself is.

Right right like I'm I'm completely serious like I know before before we yeah the CEO of interactive brokers Thomas Petterfee went live on CNBC on January 28th and he explained he was first of all he's crying and saying you know we need to stop this we need to you know this is market mania but then they're asking what was happening he was saying like our settlement system was breaking like the FTDs were forcing continuous net net settlement to sort of force close all positions. And he's like if this had if we hadn't knocked the by button we would have seen a general stock market meltdown because literally the CNS the way it would work is if there's FDs that are you know being forced to close they'll they'll go to your brokerage account. They'll override even the hedge fund like their ability to to manually trade or input trades it'll override their ability to manually trades manually trade and it will start liquidating their positions.

And with 140 reported short interest but obviously probably higher around 200 and with buying at record highs obviously each of these days was like 80 by volume. He's like there was a shortage of hunt like we're talking hundreds of millions of GME shares and the float at the time was 80 million. So he's like everything is 85 million so he's like how would you fulfill that he's like you can't so he's like the price would go into the thousands and he used the word plural thousands for a reason. And so I mean we saw like this will shock most people because again most people don't don't realize this. Some people tried to do fractional sales on the morning of of the 28th. Oh right yeah I heard this. And some of these fractional sales sold for 2600 30 200 and the highest was like 5200.

Now when looking at something like the squeezes I think the idea of like how far something goes I get the premise right behind theoretical movements but I assume people know that governing bodies aren't going to allow a financial system to collapse because of this. So it unfortunately will come at the cost of people not being able to buy the shares or whatever and it shouldn't happen because of the institutions that are systematically short that are causing the fucking problem but still that being the case in the reality like regulating bodies still aren't going to permit like a broad collapse right that's why they stepped in.

And again at most people thought that this was a short squeeze but when the when the House Financial Services Committee report came out in October of 2021 They looked at the internal SEC data and found that it actually was not a short squeeze January 2021 was not a short squeeze in the short. Oh yeah I read that I read that report it was fucking wild it is wild right because that that changes everything it's like holy shit these positions are still open. And they're they're probably unclosable so you're right like okay so you know the financial authorities that be don't want to system wide collapse but they obviously They can and they will allow large players to collapse.

They could drive down sales purposely tank the company once it goes into bankruptcy Amazon because maybe Amazon is a creditor or the owns some shares They can get first lean and they can Buy all their assets for pennies on the dollar and that way not only did they take out a competitor But now they gain all these all this inventory and assets and storefronts and you know square footage that they can now In shipping trucks and logistics and everything that they can now use to grow their own empire And so the theory is Ryan Cohen saw this happening He took them on first and the name",

Oh, by the way, there's no catalyst no news comes out It just rips 200 for no reason and then no one knows and then it goes back down and no one knows why It's like well Hold on unless retail is Collaborating and has more capital than we ever thought they did This has to be something else going on this has to be something come happening with the with the plumbing of the system and so again the The working theory is they've been using these swaps to get rid of FTD's to kick the can on the road Just so to speak to not have to settle the massive obligation that they've built up since 2020 Because from what Dario is shared with me most of these a lot of these swaps were entered into in March 2020 So they all got the bag in March 2020 they thought it was just going to print and make money",

So I actually had someone reach out to me about this This is really interesting So on some of the basket swaps you can see two different legs Which can make sense right like some of these let like the leg can mean the receiving or the sending pair so you can you can hedge it You can do a swap either way where you're either Promising to deliver shares or your promise or you're getting a promise to receive shares And so if you're promising to deliver shares then obviously you would want to be hedged and one of the ways you can hedge is via the opposite market and What they what we saw in some of this data that this Unnamed gentleman shared with me is that on",

It's so so difficult because a lot of these entities will have An amalgamation of different kinds of swaps and derivatives in their entire bulk So it's really hard to see what offsets what but The relationship that you highlight there is I think important for people to understand at least with respect to How a lot of these things are seemingly very tied together because one of the things I've done with any sort of correlation analysis is the correlation between a lot of the products isn't Really that unique compared to the correlation of most beta products But what you will find is the correlation between them strengthens during big moves Mm-hmm.

I definitely can see it would be very difficult to implement something that like that Specifically from a liquidity perspective, but it's an interesting idea And I think one of the other things to note those like the idea of naked shorting is kind of like a perversion of the rules Like that's actually side-scirting around Existing policy. I'm not so sure that that's something that Were we being again governing bodies, but specifically regulators are attempting to to promote or promulgate for the sake of liquidity I think it's something that's But I don't think it's something that is supposed to be happening Well, you know market makers have a naked shorting exemption, right? Of course, but their mandate is slightly different because they have a covering window And the the premise for them naked shorting is completely different than the premise of institutions naked shorting So for them to your point market makers.

That's what I've that's what I've seen yeah But if we could strange what strange like I was saying earlier is what strange is why is Ryan Cohen so buddy buddy with him. Why does he cozy up to him and I would think that Uh probably Carl icon changed his tune close to shorts and then now went long As the most likely explanation But you know the the saga is not as clear cut as you would want it to be right there's There are players with mixed motives and so Carl icon might be one of them Yeah, so I just asked um Chat Gbt.

It's the same thing what happened with with Nixon is 71 What happens to all these goals certificates if people actually call your bluff and say I want the gold What happens to all your gme options if everyone says Holy shit you guys are manipulating the market.

We know that's not true. So and so forth It provides like a framework But anybody that's interacting with markets at a professional level. They're not gonna actually Build models off the framework now to your point They were still completely off sides for that move for sure no doubt and I completely agree with you there But well post that they talk about this in the book but post That's when people started to doubt the e-mh and serious concerns were raised about this and then they you know Obviously, there was that I don't know if you read the the last one of the last chapters called volatility smile Ever since 1987 they've seen a uptick in the convexity curve of volatility So it's like at the very extremes. There's for extreme movements You have to pay more than for a middle extreme movement if that makes sense So there's this there's this convexity with options or with futures or with swaps or whatever it is So it's like you might it would cost more to hedge a",

It's fascinating to me Yeah, but that again this goes back to the argument of static versus dynamic systems the stock As a dynamic system all the factors affect other factors and the and the the coefficient between those two factors changes Over time and it's in relationships. Yeah. Yes. It's these complex systems are impossible to model My dad is a Or he's retired now, but he was an atmospheric scientist and he worked for a time at Noah Yeah, to model Exactly and he was doing climate modeling and they were trying to predict what the first climate would be like in 20 to 30 years And he was telling me that there's literally like 50,000 variables and after after just a few years The cl- the variable the error bars and the variables grow so long as that it becomes useless to predict And this is the same reason why for example weather prediction models can only predict the weather for accurately for a week or less And you can't predict",

That's my best interpretation Yeah, that's i mean so that was the thesis behind the push for drs right is um, you know market makers are Dipping into shares and the dtcc is allowing them to dip into shares um at brokerage accounts so if you own um And this also became with a bunch of revelations around There's goldman and jb morgan and You know bavv All marijuana lynch all these brokers were found on multiple violations from The early to mid-2000s where they allowed um, they allowed their own traders and other institutions to dip into The personal accounts of their clients and even if they were cash accounts which are technically not supposed to allow um, you know Stock lending right so this this problem quickly became concerned because the question was right If we're buying gmme and we're putting them in our fidelity or putting",

I don't understand the connection between his average share price and the stock price Yeah, same So off Putin if you have a follow on to that um, let me know I'd love to uh I'd love to get further Oh, he's saying he has an escape hatch Oh in terms of I see he's just saying essentially that he's on a good basis that makes sense. Yeah He is on a good basis for sure So Captain Chris says do you think swaps expiry is heavily correlated to spikes It can be again, so here's the issue with swaps and this is what I if you go back on my youtube channel Search proving bull um, I did a long-form video like a 30-minute video on the swaps",

We're talking you know Hundreds of millions of dollars billions of dollars for some of them In total But the issue is that's the size of the the the no-sino size of the swap how much of that is hedged and how much of a is unhatched You don't know right whoever the counterparty is so like let's say it this swap was archa-ghosts and credit sues and that credit sues now passed off to ubs So ubs if they have a swap open for 5 million shares of gme if they already have three million shares somewhere Then a lot of their exposures hedge and they don't have to worry about the rest of it Or if they're able to hedge it through options or or another swap What if they open up a swap with another kind of party that hedges you know passes this hot potato So this is the issue with this what we talked about in earlier the opacity of the market is you don't know You",

So Super super interested in your thoughts on that. Sure. Yeah. No, I so going back to that That earlier tinfoil right there's a couple different theories of what what they could be doing They could be just going you know They could be trying to reinvigorate all their and rehabilitate all their stores And or they could be trying to build out a totally new online platform all those 4.6 billion That doesn't point to just uh An internal um, you know Optimization of their systems or whatever it points to acquisition So likely I think they're going to acquire someone and acquire someone large now Question is who and the BBB why people will tell you they're gonna that rank going to come in and buy BBB.
