No idea how it works, but my hope is to be able to use this during some of these live streams to make it easier to come up with timestamps since I don't have the time to watch through a live stream and come up with timestamps. And I haven't found a AI tool that does a good job at it yet that's like accurate and not more time consuming than me doing it myself. So we have this little nifty thing and a lot of languages, I only speak one of them, a lot of languages. So should be fun. I'll tinker with this a little bit later. How is the first trading day of the year for everybody pretty solid? I did not spend a lot of time trading today, although I did put on a couple positions. I was actually cruising around this really, really cool spot that's local to us. It's called Lions Tigers and Bears. And it's like a massive animal sanctuary. And we actually got to hang out with two tigers, well, a bunch more than that. But these two tigers specifically are from the Tiger King. So when Tiger King got shut down, this sanctuary ended up helping and grabbing a couple of the tigers and not a lie, I thought it was kind of hilarious that it's from the Tiger King. I did watch that series on Netflix. It",

So yeah, kind of stoked on that. So that is where we are at today. Now let's get over to the main screen. We'll run through our standard market update and then we'll pop over to like a focus topic for today.

I said, P500 down day, well, down day across the board, I WM via Russell 2000 about flat on the down day. It's actually up just a little bit over the prior day. So even though it did have a down day, it's showing a little bit more relative strength. And that's probably because it's already been pushed down to a relative extreme it. It at least says it sits now. Vix did pop just a little bit, but it's still pretty light, bond sideways, Bitcoin, slight up tick generally sideways. Then we have, oh, interesting. These guys hit a new load today. XLB hit a new load today. That's actually kind of interesting. XLB. Yeah. So materials is, this is breaking out to the downside, like pretty massively. Right. So it was consolidating here, broke down to the downside and it's accelerating. So this is still, it's seemingly early stages of the fade. It's running into this point of control here, which is pretty light. And then on a shorter term time frame, they're just ain't much. That's interesting. Pretty significant weakness in materials, builders kind of call it, whichever you feel like. But a little weaker than I would have expected.

We have some things that are starting to stabilize. We do not have large representation of that so far. So really, really interesting beginning of the year price behavior. So I actually need to update one of my trackers really quick with all of the open prices for the first day of the year. So we opened at 589 39 in spy. So 589 39. Then in I W M, we opened up at 2293 to two. Oops. So up 2293 and then in cues. We opened up at 514 30. 514.3. What I do is in a Google sheet, I have a small little calculator for market performance.

It's less time specific, but January is actually a little more mellow than that. Interestingly enough, then TQs. TQs opened at 8054. That's literally double what it opened at last year. And then you pro opened up at 9007 and then diamonds, which I don't care about at all. 423.8 or 23.8. And then last is TLT for the tracker, TLT and TLT opened up pretty low here 878 over 10 points lower than last year's open. Interesting on that, huh? So if we look at TLT over a year period, I mean, it had a pretty nasty rollover from its start around 98. So if you're a holder of TLT for the year, it just did not, did not look that great. And I don't think anybody was surprised by that. I played a couple of the moves in TLT opportunistically, but we just know that bonds right now, not the place to be in general.

It's either going to be spy and you pro. It might be that combination. The reason why I do it that way is I can still gain the amount of leverage that I want for the total sum of money, but they're both way more liquid. So what I can do is I can trade, let's say, two thirds in spy one third, a little more than that one third in you pro. And for that aggregate amount of money, it essentially will behave as two times leverage versus three times leverage. Now you don't get rid of the individual risk you run in the product itself. In this case, you pro being three times leveraged. If there is a massive down move, it can go insolvent. That is a thing. Now I don't think it would be the case for something like you pro because it holds such a massive amount of assets under management, but that doesn't mean that it's impossible to happen. So that's the way that I try to balance gaining the liquidity that I want, but then also gaining the overall exposure that I want in",

So that's the way that I try to balance gaining the liquidity that I want, but then also gaining the overall exposure that I want in terms of leverage for the coverage strangle without stepping too far in front of the bus by going all in on you pro, all in on TQs or whatever it is. I just wrapped up the coverage strangle portfolios for last year from when I started for like the last quarter or so. And I'll do an update video at some point that walks through everything for the coverage strangle that I ran in TQs and you pro. And I'll still run like I said, a portion of it, but I'm probably going to be scaling them down in favor of something that I can run a little longer term because I prefer to gain leverage via options versus the product itself when the leverage is built into the product itself, there's a little more costs associated. It's just not as simple or efficient because you have to maintain it via options. So that's the leverage stuff that we're looking at right now.

So the reason why that matters is discretionary had been holding things up for a while as something like staples was rolling over preemptively. And now we see discretionary holding the line a little bit here. And then as of what the 27th of December, it's really starting to accelerate to the downside. It's had five consecutive down days. So that looks like general weakness to me. That's what I pick up here. Now I am interested that from a futures perspective that the futures are up a little bit here that just surprises me. Also, I think I need to make sure I save this grid before we move, update that. And then let's take a look at the truth. Yeah, so e-minis are grabbing a little bit, seeing with cues, rustle, vix is coming down just a little bit not much. Ten year, thirty year, about flat, bit coins still, crude oils, picking up just a little bit and that gas came down. That's the short term move that I traded.

And that was a pretty robust trade that just happened to move quite a bit actually interestingly enough. So looking over my portfolio and where things sit now, I'm still long overall market deltas. So it is time to start shopping. Now I also owe you all that video about the GameStop covered strangle. The only thing that I haven't fully dialed in is the size of the trade that I'm going to use. I was originally using 10k that was based on the poll that I did during one of the GameStop live streams where we essentially ask like what's the average holding. So in the whole point of me creating this portfolio, that's not really a portfolio, but this allocation is so that people can see how to trade a typical amount of money for a GameStop which again when I saw it was like 10k or something like that. Now it's flexible because the way that I'm doing it is I already have a small allocation of GameStop. It's definitely quite a bit more than that.

And it's really, it can be anything. But the goal we're doing a small amount of money is for it to be more accessible and relevant to people that are holding GameStop. So see, and this is the thing, right? So like TCM King is saying 100k, which is fine, but the problem is I just don't think most people have 100,000 with a GameStop. Do you even have 100,000 with a GameStop? Lauren says 5k, like that's the thing is based on the couple polls that I did already, it seemed like a smaller allocation. Rantiddy says full port, like a true DGEN. And that's the thing is like for people that are, what, again, I don't care what the allocation is because I don't, I don't think anybody would have honestly an allocation in GameStop at least here other than Ruin Kitty, Ruin Kitty definitely is the Trump card.

It's definitely running on. Runtidy says what I'm saying is if it breaks below a trend line. This one, not really now. I still wouldn't say that that's a giant deal to be completely honest with you. Here's a good example of this. In video. When you first draw the original trend line in Nvidia, of course, I just changed the tool. One second. If you draw the original trend line in Nvidia. Off of these lows down here. Right. It's broke down below. Pop back up and started running sideways. Right. So. The those kinds of trend lines, they don't, they're not dictatorial. Right. So when Nvidia pop below this longer term trend line, again, that I just showed you this one. It didn't fall off a cliff and like disappear into nothing. It just fell down, found support, came back up and has been consolidating since. So more importantly for something like serve, it doesn't strike me as like really weak in this region. Right. There's a ton, a ton of support and resistance in here. So that kind of congestion generally leads to continued price activity, just because people are interested at that level.

The thing I would be more interested in and personally for serve is if it starts breaking below, like all of these different levels, essentially, I'll show you. If it starts breaking below all of this, this, this, this, that's bad. That would be bad. That would be breaking down and running out of the consolidation phase here. So I wouldn't be surprised at all to see it continue to chop sideways for some time, because that's what it's been doing. Even on the up moves, it's been pretty light. So it's, it's ran from 11 to 16 big move to be clear for something like this, but still a five point move, not like, you know, insane big move, but not insane. Then it fell from 16 down to 12. Right. So if you look from low to low, it's netting about a dollar. That's about what it made here. Then it ran from 12 73 to 13 70, so about another dollar, you got out of it here on the rallies.

It's likely to continue in a general stairs that pattern like this until we see some sort of news or catalyst that might propel it a little more aggressively.

But net net, it's still trending positive. So just might be a little bit slower. It's nothing, nothing too crazy. I don't think yet.

If it starts falling back through this rally, then that's fair weakness, meaning not something I would be overly eager to step in front of. You can already see where I would want to see it start breaking above. And this would be the initial break above level, something like this 1770 ish. I would want to see it break above that on volume, but it's just taking its time. And that's okay. As long as it continues to move in the correct direction, that is genuinely ultimately what what matters here. BW says I like so far. So far was interesting because so far is getting punished a little bit. Yeah, I like this. I really didn't like.

So whatever the market does we can we can say whatever we want about it, but it doesn't matter that the market is always going to dictate the price whether we think it's over reacted or under reacted. I always say that is because that leads to the you know the commonality for traders when they get they feel like oh this thing is pushed down too far this things push down too high or whatever the case is and again the reality is it doesn't matter what we think about it right like it is whatever it is and the market is going to make a decision on it.

Tyler Stone thank you so much for the five bucks says I'd love to hear your opinion on the QS side chart it is a penny stock not going to be happy okay it's a penny stock but what the fuck did you do to me? Shit like this is so hard to give a good answer and it's because it is all over the damn map the problem with stocks like this is the underlying intrinsic value of them is not agreeable at all meaning there's somebody that thought it was worth 61 cents back here 19 in 19 November and it's gone from 61 cents to 426 so the problem again the problem with this is when you have stocks like this that are so widely disagreeable in terms of what the intrinsic value the fundamental value of the company is you're going to see moves like this where the five day average true range is 32 and the 90 day is 5 so this is I mean I just I don't personally love it so let's do some quick math it has 175 898 692 and it's trading for 426",

So really long time. About six trading years, six and a half. So what do we know? After running through all of that, we now know that Hindenburg is pretty damn accurate. We know that of the observable tickers that we could find data for pretty easily. That 22 of the time they have a negative return and 22 count and seven count had a positive return. So it's 75 hit rate over a longer term duration. So we also have a pretty high like if we were to do a distribution of negative moves compared to positive moves as a count. It would really lean heavily to the negative moves, meaning the severity, which is really interesting. So stock can only lose up to 100. So we'd have to normalize it. So very, very interesting.

That's what this looks like to me. So then let's sort by near term to longer term and let's just see how accurate they've been. Let's do it since like 21. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5 cracked, 2 and cracked. Crazy. Rantidi says they caused the moves market manipulation, shortened distorting, seller boxing. I don't agree with you. The reason why I don't agree with you is because if it was just them reporting bad information, the market wouldn't go along with it because I as a trader stand literally to my heart. Literally to make more money by squeezing Hindenburg research if they are wrong. So the market is literally incentivized to buck what they're putting out if it's not accurate. So I think from a market consensus standpoint, if Hindenburg put research out that I thought was superficial didn't really mean anything, nothing behind it. And they're just trying to force the price down and that and I know that to be their M.O. I would buy because then I know as more buyer step in, it will literally squeeze them. And that",

I would retort that it looks like they do a good job of identifying companies that are failing that are not doing well. And I mean that that's what this would lead me to believe. But as we know, there definitely are bad actors in the market, but it's just that the market would be incentivized to run the other way if they were running that way. Lawrence says it seems like manipulation to an extent many people will play just to make money. It's the name of the game. Again, I think the problem I have with it is like the size of the moves. If there was a lot of this here, where we're seeing a company down 5 3 2, I would agree with you. But the fact that the majority of these companies, as I can see that when they are negative, they're down over 50. And like that shows a company that's not doing well. That's just what that is. It's very difficult for a company to especially to be pushed down into bankruptcy or down greater than 50 without without fundamental underlying issues",

Because again, that's the cool part about markets being consensus driven. If people thought Hindenburg was just coming out with superficial hit pieces that they would, you know, fade a company to try to put out this news piece to then play on the down tick, whatever, how big the down tick is, why would anybody else participate? You're literally disincentivized from doing so. So Lauren saying the company isn't doing well and they push them off the cliff. I fully agree with that. I completely agree with that. And I don't I genuinely don't think there's anything wrong with that. I think it's okay. Again, as long as they're disclosing their positions because again, here's the deal. If Hindenburg is known to have a short position on the tickers that they're putting out research, then one, they're putting their money where their mouth is to we understand they're baked in incentive already.

And if people think the research is good, if the people if people don't think the research is good, then there's no reason to pile on because we don't agree with the research of the conclusion. But that's not what it looks like here. Super interesting. All right, gang, time for me to sign off. I'm about to make a video about the game stop covered strangle. So we will take a look at how we're setting that up. Tomorrow's live stream will still do the options trading basics. I just don't know what time just yet because we might be going out either up to the mountains or to the desert for a day just to go hang out. So TBD on when but there will be something.
