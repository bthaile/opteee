    "text": "13 options trading lies that you've been told now that's a little inflammatory not all of these are directly what I would call lies But there are a lot of Misrepresented data points that are super misleading to people so the goal of this video is to walk through 13 of them What they are and then to give you the reality around some of them hopefully so that you can make better trading decisions Let's get straight into it. So this is actually a post that I recently did on Reddit not too long ago and it serves as a great spot for us to start the conversation and I'll be able to add way more color around these obviously because we are on a video So the first one you see here is 90 of options expire worthless and the reality this is not true the Overwhelming majority of options are closed before Expiration 55 to 60 of the total option contracts that are opened about 30 to 35 of those expire worthless So the reason why this matters is because sometimes when people will say like oh I like to sell options because most of them expire worthless It's not the case and it's important to differentiate that's why I highlight a lot of these It's not just because the fact in and of itself is wrong But it's the implications of what the lie is in this context So you can look at this data on",

It's completely fine But what I'm most interested here are Are the rationale and the implications of things which is the next one is selling theta is an edge The answer to this is sometimes it inherently is not an edge theta is Simply the measurement of time. So when we think about an option an option has two Parts of the premium intrinsic and extrinsic value X-trinsic value is broken off it has time Which is we know time time is defined at the onset of the option time decays linearly And then there's volatility the volatility component is where",

You can say that the problem is that unless you're delta hedging In purely isolating volatility which most people don't you're not fully exposing yourself To this exact phenomenon and again the implication here is people will automatically default To selling because they think that selling always has an edge and it doesn't In something like smb500 it very often will but it's not always So it can be really misleading the next one This one's really native to the people that trade the wheel Which is when we say things like I'm gonna sell puts to buy stock at a discount and Electup premium sounds great doesn't it sounds really really good. Here's the problem if you sell a put Let's take a look at an example in something like spy and you come in here you go 49 days out And you grab these 30 delta short puts the 592s And you sell them When you sell a put you are taking undefined down to zero risk and you have defined profit What's the payoff for that?

That's nowhere near 500 It's nowhere near your strike price, but you still make money So the caveat here is you do have to make sure that you're overcoming any changes in volatility and any changes in theta Which is actually why a lot of times I go further out in time like this 84 days to expiration because if you take a look at the theta here It will be much less theta here is 15 cents if we come into this 21 days expiration we go to that same 15 delta you take a look at theta It's 25 cents and you're really double. So that's the trade off there I have a video that goes super far into detail on buying call options smarter to balance all of these things including gamma But for this specific point you just need to know you don't need it to go above your strike price in order to make money You make money quite a bit before that The next one you can't go broke taking profits you absolutely can and this is for a very specific reason That's pretty simple. It has everything to do with expected return sooner or later risk is going to be realized What I mean by that is so we have nine winning trades one",

It has everything to do with expected return sooner or later risk is going to be realized What I mean by that is so we have nine winning trades one losing trade You're making 50 on each of those winning trades. So it's really high win rate 90 percent However on that one loss if you lose four to seventy five dollars your gross overall expected PL here is negative 25 bucks You lose money So why why is that the case you can't go broke taking profits? Well the problem is sooner or later If you continue to trade you're going to have a loss. So the only scenario where You can't go broke taking profits is if you don't have a losing trade Which you're we're all going to have at some point. So it's a it's a completely Broken saying that forces people into something called the disposition effect which is really well studied And it is where traders have a propensity to take winning trades down too fast and let winning trades run too large And these kinds of sayings feed directly into that the way we need to manage trade is based on expected return It's not about little sayings like you can't go broke taking profit because sooner or later you're going to have losing trade Which can hurt The next one buying is",

There's lots of reasons why people are doing things So if you take the inference that there's zero sum to mean that somebody is directly opposing your idea for Potentially better research idea.

    "text": "If you could make a thousand dollars a day Obstrastrating in 10 minutes as a beginner only who wouldn't do that Everybody would there's a reason why trading has such a high failure rate So don't fall for this kind of stuff as you scroll through some more you can see some basic content This is all good teaching people how to do stuff. This is Benjamin's channel. He's a homie So you should definitely check out his stuff This is also Chris another good dude, and then you get down a little bit further and then we have this 4,600 in a million dollars and 13 minutes again that can completely happen There's nothing wrong with that in and of itself The problem with this is that it's designed to set up terrible expectations for you the beginner And make you believe that this is normal. This is common. This will happen all the time And again, it's just clickbaits designed to get you to click through the video again I'm not saying there's anything wrong or that that didn't happen I don't know But what I'm telling you is that the inference from stuff like this is to make you think that it's common repeatable easy And it simply isn't The next one this one's super simple, but everybody messes this up You'll see things like rolling avoids losses And again, I go into an incognito window So it's not skewed by anything that I look at and",

It's not what it is at all I actually would recommend checking out this video that talks about the reality and how it actually works This isn't just to promote my own stuff But it's because there are a lot of misconceptions about rolling options like this one here I can tell you what rolling isn't It's not free money. It objectively is not free money So Rolling options and a link to that video so you could check it out But in a nutshell, it's closing a trade and opening a new trade and tying the accounting together Whatever the realized PL of the prior trade was that's whatever the PL is That's what's realized So rolling trades is literally booking a profit or a loss whatever it was in opening a new trade that may Overwhelmed the prior loss, but it doesn't produce free money. Not how it works The last thing trading is hard. This is completely Completely accurate, but inaccurate at the same time. It's kind of a fun topic actually The reason why I say",

This is completely Completely accurate, but inaccurate at the same time. It's kind of a fun topic actually The reason why I say that is trading the actual process of trading is supremely easy All of the work all of the difficulty is done long before you click the button When you're actually executing a strategy and physically trading that's the easy part It's as easy as it gets. It's just execution All of the hard work is done before this is like people who practice really really hard Kobe Bryant's a great example And when he was playing games he would literally talk about how game was like a release Because he put himself through hell in training and in practice So that games essentially become easy by comparison So trading itself overall is very difficult the vast majority of people will fail But if you define a process you go through the effort of building strategies Building a plan that you can execute that you trust Trading in and of itself the button clicking component of it is super super easy So what are some other options trading myths or lies you've heard? I'd love to hear them in the comments be an outlier. I will see you all later",
