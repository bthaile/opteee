    "text": "13 options trading lies that you've been told now that's a little inflammatory not all of these are directly what I would call lies but there are a lot of misrepresented data points that are super misleading to people so the goal of this video is to walk through 13 of them what they are and then to give you the reality around some of them hopefully so that you can make better trading decisions let's get straight into it so this is actually a post that I recently did on Reddit not too long ago and it serves as a great spot for us to start the conversation and I'll be able to add way more color around these obviously because we are on a video so the first one you see here is 90 of options expire worthless and the reality this is not true the overwhelming majority of options are closed before expiration 55 to 60 of the total option contracts that are opened about 30 to35 5 of those expire worthless so the reason why this matters is because sometimes when people will say like oh I like to sell options because most of them expire worthless it's not the case and it's important to differentiate that's why I highlight a lot of these it's not just because the fact in and of itself is wrong but it's the implications of what the LIE is in this context so you can look at this data um",
