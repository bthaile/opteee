    "text": "Because money is stupid. Money has no purpose for me. You know, I own my house. We own our businesses, you know, I own, I have everything I need. And I can't even spend the money I have. So I mean, do I give it away, you know, whatever, who knows at the end? But money has no utility for me at all. It doesn't mean the thing. I mean, it allows me to have nice dinners and stay in nice hotels somewhere. Maybe going a nice trip and you know, it allows me to have whatever I want, which isn't that much anyway. But it doesn't turn me out. So like, you know, the the most fascinating, the most interesting part of my life at this point is I would love to help a community of people that are like-minded, you know, build wealth, however that means. And I feel like if that's your legacy, then you really left something special behind. You know, money can only do so much.",
