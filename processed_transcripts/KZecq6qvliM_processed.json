There's a very specific reason. And it looks like we got some Moda, we got Zack, Scott, Beach, bum. We got Reese, our boy, Shrej, good to see you. My brother, Shrej, I hope you and the family are doing well. I've been reading a lot about your people of India, spending that section in that book I was telling you about is fucking thick. There's a lot of Indian history that is absolutely fascinating, big fan. Dark Mark says to look for anomalies. That's part of it. That's not the reason I'm thinking of, but that is absolutely a benefit of doing this, for sure. You're on the right path though. So let's take a look at a scenario. And I think it might help prove this point. Let's say we have a 1 return, 2 return, 1 return, 2 return. If we average this, you have an average of a 1.5 return, right? Then we have another scenario. The average is 1.5. What do you notice here? This is a very basic example, but I'm trying to prove a point here that hopefully we'll be, put you on the right",

Reese says does it behave within the expected range? That's part of it. But that's part of it. Focus on math. What's the difference between arithmetic mean and a geometric mean? No clue. That's fair. That's completely okay. Anybody have a guess? An arithmetic mean simply takes the average of numbers. A geometric mean accounts for volatility across the numbers. These two things will have a different geometric mean. This, they have the same arithmetic mean. And it's because the mean is just the average. So think of it in terms of your returns. If this was 1.5 return, 1.5 return, 1.5 return, so on and so forth. And this is 1 return, 2 return, 1 return, 2 return. The average percent return is the exact same. But the path that the return takes is different. And this is why we use something like a compound annual growth rate, Cagger, which is a geometric mean. It accounts for the volatility of returns. This is literally doubling and then halfing of the return and then doubling the return again. This is literally no change in the return. It's the same thing. Okay. Taking",

Taking it back to this example, I want to be able to conduct some very basic statistical analysis around the constitution of these averages. I want to know what the deviation is because we can have an average here. That's 11.6 and then an average actually move a 14.1. You could say, well, fuck, I don't want to do that. That sounds terrible. That's not good at all. But then you could go through the data and find that there's an instance where the implied move was 11.6 and it came in at 33. Let's just say that that was one instance. Let's say everything else was closer to within the range. Well, this would lead you to believe it's not suitable. When you look at the actual constitution of the data points, you might find that it's completely suitable. That there was an event that was outsized that will happen with earnings. And then you can be completely fine with the overall risk that you're taking in the trade. So this is why if I'm trading earnings, and this is why for those that have seen some of the different versions of kind of like the more basic earnings trackers",

So Cliff notes version. You can use the averages, but it's a very broad brushstroke tool that misses a lot of detail that you want as a trader. The only reason to not get to the actual detail that you want as a trader is either you just don't know and that's okay. That's the point of this to telling you you should do this or you're fucking lazy. And if you're lazy, again, I can already tell you trading is not the shit for you. Now I genuinely believe from the bottom of my heart that's probably not the case for people that are hanging out on a Saturday afternoon to learn about options trading in this case, tracking some earnings positions. So my guess is for some people in the watching the live stream, probably more the former category, where it literally just might be a gap of information. But I want to make sure that that point is crystal clear. So when I say you can't use, you can, but you shouldn't just use the average and that you should look",

It's not just that the arithmetic mean can be skewed by outliers, which is completely accurate, by the way, 100 correct. But there's a second point in there that is even more important. Put yourself in the position of a person that's trying to trade these. Put yourself in the position of we have earnings coming up on February 25th and CLSK. And the expected move is 19.2. We can look at the average expected move is 11.6 and the average realized is 14.1. Does this 19.2? Does that mean that we're good? That this is a good trade green light. Not inherently so. There's a really important component to this. So haters, take that mind, take that thought one step further. We have the composition that there can be outliers that skew the data. But then there's also two other terms that you probably will want to become familiar with. And I realize like at some point, we're going to have to do some sort of like basic statistics on like tracking these things.

There's the fact that I can find a couple outliers. What else do I care about here? Any ideas? You know that arithmetic means a prone skew, skew prone. Don't know why I said that backwards. That didn't make sense. But if we're getting ready to put a trade on in here, volume and volatility, that's not it. Think about the frequency. If the implied versus actual was skewed because of two outliers, would I care more about that than if the implied versus actual essentially has a deviation that shows it very regularly is outside the expected move? Which one of those would I be less prone to put a trade on? Something that was skewed because of two big moves or something that shows a persistence in implied being underpriced compared to realized. When you frame it that way, it becomes very straightforward, right? I think everybody would know the answer to that. So, when we're looking at this data by plotting it out each time, we get a sense of the count of frequency that it exceeds. Which again, we can see this here. We're tracking this in a very",

What I would do is for each of these, I would actually build out the input section to include both implied versus realized for the past 12. And then you can look at things like the variance. Having a standard deviation of log normal returns is really useful because it helps normalize some of the moves and it's a slightly more informative metric. I am not going to go into that far of detail on this because again, this is all for beginners. You should know about that and you should look into that. But you don't need to have that mastered upfront. This information that will be pertinent in the future. This goes back to the beginning thing that I've talked to you guys about a million times now, which is as a beginner trader, you have to put first things first. And we're applying a little bit of the Pareto principle where if I look at the average expected move and the average realized move and the frequency that realized is greater than implied, then I use that as the basis for the decision.

So the point is you have to get something on the board to then iterate and learn off of. I'm just giving you a little bit of a deeper roadmap here to keep in the back of your minds. So let's continue now with this example. So we have the expected move from this move here. I'm using historic data right now, so this won't be obviously super informative. And then I'm going to actually insert another column. This will be average expected move. And that is 14.1. And then we need to add a couple other columns in here, this expiration, these prices away. Those are the ranges. So this we can do something like IV edge something really, really basic. This isn't exactly what I would consider it, but it's okay. And what I would do is actually codify this so that if it's conditional formatted, I use conditional formatting a lot because it makes things a lot faster to eyeball.

Does this give me the date that would be convenient? Doesn't let's come. Let's see if I can just pick it. If I remember, oh shit, this does not look familiar. Well, we can make it easy. We can go to the end of August. See where the little thing is and then go back right here. The ninth after the close, we need to go to the ninth. And then we need to adjust this so that it's towards end of day entry, just like we would actually trade it like this. And now we can I think we already started modeling. Yeah, we already have the trade essentially modeled. I'm not going to worry about margin requirement. Just know that that's something that we like I absolutely would track. I just don't care to bother with it. That would give us stuff like return on invested capital and whatnot. Maybe I'll just hide it so that you know what's there. And then this is the data that we're inputting and then this is all auto populated data. So this should be nine aug. This minus this. I don't know. Oh no, I'm so stupid. I'm so stupid.

Eight delta for 22 cents. Let's see if that's what we can get here. Eight delta's yeah, this is correct. I don't know what all this is. Eight delta. Yep, that's exactly correct. Okay, so it's not nine August. It's two days. Two. And we're at 14 52 now 14 52. Right. And this is normally what I would do next to these is input the strike price. And then I can calculate like how far away that that is from the current spot price. I don't really care. I think that this is useful for people to see. I can kind of visualize it from the delta alone. So I'll put it in here just to try to give you a slightly more holistic example. So this would be put strike all strike.

The other thing that I do want to do though is make sure that I maintain the same convention. So what I do is this. I've been using puts first. I want to keep using puts first. So I'm going to maintain that here so that it all flows together. So this is all put stuff then call stuff. Then we have put stuff call stuff. That's the idea. And this we can just do a percentage for the puts. We can see how far away our put strike is from it. So what we would do is take this minus this divided by this. And this will give us how far away we are. And this would be to the upside. Would be this minus this divided by this. So then we can monitor how big the gap is relative to what the expected move is.

And I would subtract the stock price times the expected move. This gives me the lower range. So then what I can do is I can color code this. Then for the upper range, I can say, I need to know my call strike. I know my bad. I need to know this plus this times this. So this shows the upside band. And then what I would do here is just create another color code rule. I would essentially conditionally format this. And I would format it as. I don't want this row. My bad. Wrong row. Want this row. And what I'm going to format it as like this. So we'll do conditional formatting.

So what then I can do is I can as I'm manually inputting data for what's coming up this week, there's a bunch of usable data that's being populated for me as I'm moving along. So in this case, that's just letting me see based on the expected move, like the average or the current expected move, our my strikes for the shorts outside the range. And that's kind of really important because if they're not, that doesn't necessarily mean you don't take the trade, but it definitely means there needs to be a pretty good reason why we would take that trade because there could be another trade that looks even better for whatever reason. So that's the next step that would go into there. I just don't want this getting like too noisy too fast. This would be when we do the actual close.

So now we can start filling in our basic data. So 2D stock price right now is 208.34. Now this is a great example of how this sheet might have to evolve and I'll show you how and why. So the expected move for D's was 9.4. And the average expected move was 10.2. And I realized that we should have average realized volatility. And this is 10.1, 10.2. I didn't bother going back and adding it to that yet. So then we can take a look at this is incorrect because that's based on you can so for the implied volatility edge here, there's a lot of different ways you can slice this and you'll find that different versions are more helpful. You can look at what the implied volatility edge is relative to IV. You can take a look at the implied volatility edge relative to realized volatility. It's really up to you and what you like to see. So what you can do to kind of capture both of this, you could do IV by average IV. And then you could do IV by",

So that we can get a sense this should be those two, well, it's not average. We're doing just a straight ratio. So average less. So then this would be the expected move less the average realized move. And then for CLSK, that was 14.1 is the realized, realized what I was doing 11.6 is the average. 14.1 here. So now you can track how you compare to the average IV. You can compare how you track to the average realize volatility. And again, I would do the same formatting, just like we did on the other one. I'm just not going to bother. Move all this down. And normally what I would do for stuff like this is I want to make it, I like to make these kind of clean. So what I'll do is I'll do a lot of if playing formulas for stuff like this, I'm just not going to go through and do that now. So let's take a look at ZS.

But once it's set up, it's really not that heavy to maintain. It's actually quite easy to maintain. And what I mean by that is like for me to fill this in didn't take me long at all. It definitely took me less than a minute, especially if I wasn't flipping back between CLS and this is giving me most of what I want to see right out of the gate. I can already see what the ranges are. So again, we want to compare these ranges. The downside range is 188.76 compared to the put side is 180. So that's good.

    "text": "learning the earnings landscape. Yeah, I wouldn't waste literally any time with something that's not tradable because I'm actually going to build a relationship with stuff that I trade. But in the beginning, when you're building a data set just to understand how these things move, that's there's nothing that falls into that bucket. It's worth your time to at least see how it moves. It doesn't take that long. So now let's go to three December and I'm going to fast forward now to zero seven thirty. I'm going to give it an hour for volatility to come out. Now again, this is applying a broad brushstroke in entire hour. You can pick all different kinds of times that you might want to exit. And if I was enterprising, I would include different exit times here for me to test. Do I want to try exiting 15 minutes after the open five minutes after the open 30 minutes after the open 45 or an hour? Whatever time do I want to wait until the end of the next day? It's entirely up to you to pick now of general starting point. I would argue is after 15 minutes and sometime before three hours. Because in that time frame, you're starting to take on a different risk, which is like the continuation of the earnings move and stuff like that. So Mike says five Celsius, which is 41 Fahrenheit, I much prefer your temperature hands down. I do not like",

So Mike says five Celsius, which is 41 Fahrenheit, I much prefer your temperature hands down. I do not like warm. So we're normally when Mel and I travel, we literally go like we go to places that don't have warmer temperature. Like unless I'm diving, if I'm scuba diving, which I love, which is funny, because that's always in the fucking tropics where there's like good scuba diving. Typically dying unless I'm in the water. But I guess that's also kind of perfect because if you scuba dive somewhere in like the Caribbean a lot and you're in the water a lot like I am, your body temperature naturally lower. So you actually run pretty cool and the warm feels not bad. But other like barring that I run way too warm. That's why we go to places like Iceland, Alaska, like I'm trying to get the fuck out of the heat. I do not like that is that warm right now. But all right, let's see, let's see how things go here. So PLCE was at 13195. This would be 3Ds in the example. 3Ds, 3Ds. Stock price here is 13.195. Premium doesn't matter.

Let's see. So let's eyeball this. So we can do for the put side. We want to see if it's greater and then by how much. So we'll do stock less our strike for the put side. So this would be stock less put strike. And then for the call side inverse. So this would be our call less not equals less stock. So this would be all less strike less. So this will show us our gap for our option. So now the conditional formatting here would be really simple. We would essentially just do if this is greater than zero, then it's green. If it's less than zero, it's it's not green that's bad. I don't have a premium in here. It doesn't matter for this example, because there's no trade just wanted to track it. So ZS, let's take a look.

And I'm realizing that this format needs to apply to everything. And we need to take a look at what did we have? We had the 180s to 45s for 2.30. So the 180s and 240 fs. So the 180s and the 240 fives. An hour after the open they're trading for 13 cents. So let's say we exit there minus 0.13. And now we have our first full complete trade.

I would be as efficient as humanly possible. So what that means is if I'm taking the time to click through on demand, you'll notice that it takes a few seconds to load each time. I can absorb a lot of data if I'm efficient. So what that means is I can have one variation of this that is using 10 deltas. I can have another variation of this that's using 15 delta. I can have another variation that's using 20 delta. If I'm so inclined, whatever you feel like. And you don't have to do a million of them, but you can get a really good sense using a few of them. And by doing that, you increase your efficiency massively. Because then as you fast forward time and you see what happened, rather than just looking at the 11 and a half and the 12 and a half, maybe I'll have one for the 11 and the 20 and so on and so forth, whatever aligns with those deltas.

But after you complete this kind of work, you can learn a lot about what things make sense. What deltas generally seem to work, you can get more sophisticated and you can say, well, maybe I changed my deltas based on the IV, IV edge, the implied volatility compared to the average implied volatility. Maybe if that's a bigger edge, I care about that, or maybe you create a composite metric that takes the standard deviation of all of the individual data points that I showed you. And you compare that against your IV to then adjust what deltas and strikes also your position size. Again, you don't have to get into that upfront. That's like future state. That's next step stuff. But I want you to be aware of these things so that you have some ideas on what it can progress into what to look for.

But I actually want to cherry pick one of these that went really bad so that we can see what that looks like. So let's see if we can find one from this list. I'm just moving it over here so that I can flip through them fast. And we can find one that went terribly. CRM, how'd you do? We could try CRM. That one looks okay to start with. How did Octodew? That one's not bad enough. MRVL. 95 to 115. That's a big move. The LTR. No way. That's a good one. CHWY. No, that's a good one. AEO. Ooh, that's a... That's a big drop. DHPT. I like AEO. So AEO before the move, they must have been after the market, yeah. Or before it doesn't matter. Okay, so they closed. Let's just, I'm going to eyeball this really fast. They closed at 2054. Oops.

We said, not CRM, but Octa, 330 to 360. That's like 10. So we can skip that one. MRVL was another pretty big one. MRVL, you closed at 9591. 9591. And then where did you get to here? Opened at 112. It was like a 16 move. So we can use MRVL. MRVL I think would be a good example also because it's exhibited like a pretty big move to the upside. And the upside tends to be priced a little less rich, but it'll be compensated by for the downside. So MRVL, so I'm not going to worry about the dates and all this shit. I'm just going to throw this in super fast so that we can see. OK, so the expected move is 8.6. This is a great example. The average expected move is 8.6 with very low deviation, as I look at it, which is very interesting. 10.3 of the past 12. There's one, two, three, four, five, six instances that we moved outside. So we're going to look at 60s. And let's build us a trade. Except I forgot where what days is this the third after the close. This is good. Third",

The fucking options market is telling you what's going to happen. That's hilarious. That fucking love options. It literally tells you what's going to happen before it happens. It's like a premonition. Now I say that definitively knowing what happened. So part of it isn't just but the market was pricing this move. Like there's no doubt my mind. That's an objective fact. 110. We'll do a one lot. And at the 84 110 84 110. You got a dollar for one. Okay. So let's fast forward to tomorrow. The 4th of December. And let's see. For these.

So if you take a look again, I'm just using the data from before. But if you take a look at this. The put had a massive buffer. The call did not have a massive buffer. The call actually was projected to be in the money. From our rudimentary system here. So this we would have closed out for 793.

Now what I can show you is that your net P and L is not so bad. So you absolutely are down money. You're down 456 bucks. But you also had something that literally had a double expected move that straight up gave you warning ahead of time in a few different instances.

But what I can tell you is that again, like this would have been a no trade here because of this condition right here. The fact that even based on the implied move. We were going to be in the money. That means you have no buffer whatsoever. If the realized move is bigger than the implied that's unacceptable on an earnings trade. That's just bad risk.
