    "text": "What's up, outliers? Time for a quick market analysis on GameStop specifically because man was there a day today. I want to talk about the overall price action where it seems to be sitting. At the end of the video, I'll go through some position updates for the coverage strangle. I don't imagine most people are super interested in that, but I'm sharing that just because I said I would. So I'll save that towards the end and we'll spend most of the time just talking about the stock, the movement, what things look like because this is a noteworthy day. I did a little homework and I went back essentially to the inception of GameStop and I wanted to look at what's the frequency that we saw 10 plus down moves specifically. And as you can see is a total representation of days, it's just over 1. This is rounded down because like 1.02 or something like that. So you can see that this is a hyper rare case, 75 instances as a gross count. So you would think this would be necessitated or follow some sort of big news cycle. Maybe Ryan Cohen steps down. Maybe this could be GameStop decides that it's going to file for bankruptcy. None of that's happening. Cohen is still doing his job. He's doing a great job. We're not seeing any underlying change in the company at all. So the fact that there's this big of a move on literally no news",

We're not seeing any underlying change in the company at all. So the fact that there's this big of a move on literally no news that I can find is exceedingly suspect. Then we take this article from yesterday funny enough. This is from Benzinga and you can see that there was a bit of a bearish series of trades that came in for GameStop yesterday, literally yesterday. Did that activity cause this sort of movement? Personally, I don't think so. Did that activity front run a potential movement? Maybe I don't know. I can't prove it one way or the other. But what I can tell you objectively is that when I look across the other tickers that are most closely associated with this, and we grab XRT, XRT had a inside day today. What is this down 0.86 it's showing us? So open here at 78 52, closed at 77 59. So the broader sector that it's a part of didn't experience this move. Then if we take a look at small caps, small caps literally had an update. So what happened here? Now I did take a look at AMC just at a curiosity because it is frequent that you will see somewhat sympathetic moves between these. Now you can see the lead in to the previous drops looks different in AMC",

Now you can see the lead in to the previous drops looks different in AMC than it does for GameStop. But both of them do have four consecutive drops that culminated with a much larger drop today. Interesting. Is that not? So it starts to beg the question, what the fuck is going on? Why would this happen? What's causing this? Because it's already fallen out the 10 days rolled over, 20 day rolled over, it punched right through the 50. And now it's charging towards the 150. I'm going to change this to a 200 out of curiosity to see how this stacks up. Still got a long ways before it gets to a 200-day AMA, which is still shockingly positively sloping. So I don't see anything. I haven't seen any sort of news that would explain this move. Now the other thing that we were talking about before though was the expectation that this week was going to be volatile. And we can see that the front wall here is literally 136. Now it's really important when we're quoting volatility like this to differentiate between upfront wall for this front expiration and wall for the underlying itself. When people standardly quote volatility, they'll standardly quote this 102. Or it was a little bit",

When people standardly quote volatility, they'll standardly quote this 102. Or it was a little bit lower earlier today that it was sub 100. But that's for 30 day vol. That's forward looking and it's using a month. We can get more specific than that with options chains by looking at internal expirations from that standard expiration cycle about 30 days out somewhere in here. And you can see that it's 136.2 on this front expiration. A lot of that. And we knew part of this was going to happen this week because of this. There are a ton of options. There's literally 540,000 calls against 153,000 puts that expire this week. This is expanded day over day as compared to contracting, which is really interesting because expiration is a few days away here. The over half of the total call OI is in this Friday's expiration. That is unequivocally a recipe for volatility. You're going to see it. And we are seeing it. It is what it is. So that being said, when I see the movement here in GameStop, I see literally nothing that I can directly point at other than some interesting sympathetic moves with some interesting other names.

This is why I talk about technical analysis being something that you can loosely apply to GameStop. You cannot apply standard technical analysis to GameStop because it does not follow the standard behavior of supply and demand because for this to happen, there has to be an excess of supply that is built up typically driven by some sort of news event. Overall volume today was 11.76, 11.77 mil, which is a little bit over the five day average, which is a point eight, and over the 20 day average, which is 10.6. So big expansion in volume on a relative basis, mostly sell side, no surprise. And this thing just got absolutely punished on what looks to be absolutely no news. Now the good part, volatility is alive. That's not all bad. The reason why that's not all bad is because it offers a lot of different opportunities for positioning and adjusting existing positions, especially for us options traders. I made a bunch of adjustments to make GameStop position today that we will talk about in just a few seconds. I want to take a look at this front expiration cycle though. Look at the build out.

We are not seeing anywhere near that scale on the put side. So then who stands to benefit from this? There's not a bunch of open options in the front expiration that are set to take advantage of this. So then that begs the question, what was opened recently? Was there anything that stuck out to me from a recent options entry perspective? And not really because if we isolate this to puts over the last couple of days, there really wasn't that much going on. There really wasn't. There's obviously some being bought, but nothing big, nothing that would lead me to believe that somebody knew something and is trying to front run a big order via derivatives, at least in the short term. So that part's also kind of interesting. I'm not seeing any big artifacts popping up from the options chain that would indicate that. So what do we do from here?

We also know that this is a highly volatile stock. We also know that this is coming up on one of the biggest options, explorations that it's had in some time with over 500,000 calls expiring this week that's going to cause a certain level of volatility. What I also found interesting is if we take a look at just overall gamut exposure, we can see that there's obviously a tremendous amount of exposure at the 30s. And we can see that dealers are likely net long gamma. So their hedging behavior really shouldn't be adding massively to market volatility here. But on a big, sustained move like this, it's going to cause some larger changes in their book. But we can also see as we go further up that there's bigger concentrations of gamma and down by where we are now, 2728. Really light. There really isn't a whole lot there.

But that is one thing we should track going forward is institutional holdings. And if there's any big changes on that side of things. So fascinating movement today in games now to talk quickly about a few of those adjustments that I made. You'll notice now that we're actually down 100 shares. So we're sitting on 200 shares with the basis of 2827. So the first adjustment that was made was actually unwinding some of the shares. I had 100 that came out from an original basis. Realistically, this should be 2431. What I do in for this one is I'm using FIFO accounting. And literally the only reason for taking some of this down today was to wait and see what the stock does.

So it's not much money. And I'm still already sitting at 54 utilize now. And you can see that I'm about split evenly with the little edge in terms of hash secured put requirement. And that's because of the volatility. I'm purposely getting a little more exposure via cash secured puts at this juncture because volatility is so high. So this is designed one to capture hopefully some of this movement. But it also will capture some of the wall. And what I do to manage the equity side of it, you can see I already have alerts set. So these alerts are just like, hey, it's starting to go back the other way. Start buying outright. That's the cool part about being a trader is I can come in and out of things to manage my basis. Because here's the scenario. Let's just say GameStop comes all the way back down into this area down here where the point of control is. And it's in the 22s. I'm not saying it's doing that. I just don't know. But if it does, there's no reason for me to hold onto it at a basis of 28 as",

So this is the difference between a trader's approach with GameStop is what I'm trying to do is capture profits based on these movements, which subsequently allow me to build larger positions without adding any more money. I'm literally creating money out of the movement. That's what's going on right now. The other thing that you'll notice in addition to those puts, I took off, I think both of these. Yeah. So I took off the 32s and the 28s and then I essentially consolidated them into these. And then the other thing that I did was take these calls down for about 19 cents. And then I offered new calls.

But I adjusted it because this would be locking in a profit if I ended up getting assigned at 35 with the basis of this. So that's the, that's the near term game plan here is to continue running the coverage triangle. I took some of the shares down, seeing which way the stock decides to go. I don't really care which way it goes in the near term to be honest, because if it goes up, I buy if it goes down once it looks like it's finally setting, I buy.

It's the second largest volume. No, that's on here. But to me, the level to be beat is here now. Because once if it falls below this, there's nothing. There's very, very, very little support all the way down until it gets down towards here. So I don't necessarily foresee that happening just yet. I never know. I also didn't foresee this move today happening. So just because I don't see it coming, doesn't mean it won't happen. But I do think that there's a pretty good chance that it'll consolidate in here for a while, just because there's a lot of people that are willing to, willing to transact at these levels.
