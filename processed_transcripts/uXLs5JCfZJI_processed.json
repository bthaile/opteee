    "text": "What's up, outliers, Eric here today's all about GameStop. I didn't do a dedicated video on this. I actually have another one in the hopper for you all though about trading GameStop with options. We've already done two videos so far that have talked about some strategies that I think are applicable to folks that like to trade this stock specifically. And I have a couple more that I think might be suitable as always. All of this is just for your general consumption. The entire reason why YouTube is to spread information. You can figure out what's suitable, what works for you, what doesn't. That's all good. The hope is just to share ideas and information. Now the options expiration for today was a little bit lighter because this wasn't the densest series that exists right now when I say series, I just mean expiration cycle. So here we can see that the total open interest here was 140,000 calls and 58,000 puts, which is actually a little bit on the lighter side. Now if we take a look at 20 dees, you can see that it's 108 at 42. The interesting thing is that the 17 Jan is the spicy one so far. This is where people are positioning. And again, I continue to highlight things as I see them, which is important in that this is relatively new for GameStop. Typically speaking, we see so much of the total open interest in the front expirations. This has",

Typically speaking, we see so much of the total open interest in the front expirations. This has been about a month now that we've continually seen. So I a little further out in time. Now it was up to 60 days out when I first started noticing it. Now obviously the 17 Jan's about 35 days expiration, but that's where most of this is, which is again, really interesting just because it's slightly different. One of the things that you'll notice when we do any sort of options analysis or stock analysis for that perspective is you have to build a baseline understanding of what you're looking at. What is normal is entirely relative to the stock that you're looking at. So for example, GameStop, it's pretty normal at this point to have call OI exceed put OI. If we take a look at something else by comparison like spy, you'll notice it's the inverse. You almost always will see put OI exceed call OI. So you have to understand the individual ticker that you're looking at because there's unique qualities. This to me is not worthy not because calls exceed puts. Again, that's generally the standard here, but it's that the ratio between these, that's now what I track for GameStop because I've identified that as",

Again, that's generally the standard here, but it's that the ratio between these, that's now what I track for GameStop because I've identified that as an important trait between these. Normally when we see calls at a two to one ratio or greater, that tends to be coupled with higher volatility, which indicates an expectation of movement. Rightfully so because we just had earnings, if we take a look at the chart funny enough, we landed at 2799, that is an interesting number. Now, I know for those that are really, really into Max Payne and they think that that's like the dominant feature that continually forces GameStop to fall just below numbers, that is a partial truth. We can find instances like this where I absolutely would agree with that. I would just be cautious to think that it's always Max Payne that always forces price to move one direction or another because that starts to sabotage other potential inputs if we essentially prop one up as the dominant feature. Now what I can tell you because I've made videos about Max Payne, I've studied it pretty extensively not just from GameStop, but just as a general phenomenon, which is interesting. There is efficacy behind it, meaning predictive qualities, but it's not perfectly predictive. There's a lot of variance in it. But what I",

But what I can tell you unanimously across different cases that I've studied is in these exact instances where we are very close, it's more likely to occur, but if you'll notice it's already above 28. So that's pretty interesting to me. You'll tend to find this exact format when we're very close where it tends to be more pronounced. So in this case, seems a little, seems a little something going on. Maybe who knows? I don't know. I'm just speculating here. I'm just a dude on the internet. Let's take a look at the rest of the option sheen actually before that. Let's take a look through the stock because I do want to talk about the chart here. This I continue to see people feeling really upset about the stock price and I just don't see why. The stock is doing really well. The fact that this thing is hovering consistently, post earnings in the high 20s, just shy of 30.

We've touched this a few times, but then it slowly is drifted up and out of there, which is fantastic. So that's really cool. I already did a video talking about GameStop earnings, which is pretty solid. They came in at a slight profit, although again, the market wasn't necessarily super impressed with the profit. And again, rightfully so because most of it came from interest earned on their cash horde, which is great. But again, from a trader investor perspective, we don't necessarily want to see a company making a bunch of money from holding cash that happens to earn a yield because rates are high right now. We want to see sales revenue. We want to see the business growing. So that's not to belittle the earnings. The earnings was great. It was a slight beat, which is awesome. But I still think that's why we didn't see that beat lead to some sort of massive move because I do think as we start to see GameStop have stronger earnings as it continues to evolve.

And for those that are unfamiliar, I have a couple videos that talk about post earnings announcement drift. But post earnings announcement drift tends to happen when you have a company that has a big earnings beat. So if you take a look here, the earnings was 95 cents. It came in at a dollar 25. That's a big beat. And then it's typically followed if it's going to exhibit post earnings announcement drift to the positive side. It's typically coupled with a gap, right? So it typically means that there's some sort of really new news that's led to repricing and reevaluation of the value of a stock. And that tends to carry out over time because it's not immediately priced in big, big sources of money take some time to move around. So that's post earnings announcement drift. And I would not be surprised at all to see GameStop start exhibiting that once it starts having slightly stronger earnings. But I think that's why even though they had a beat in this instance, it didn't necessarily drive post earnings announcement drift one way or the other because of that. So back to the option chain, we have really light volatility. I mean, it's essentially sub 100 across all of it. The front is always going to be jacked up. But the next",

    "text": "instance, it didn't necessarily drive post earnings announcement drift one way or the other because of that. So back to the option chain, we have really light volatility. I mean, it's essentially sub 100 across all of it. The front is always going to be jacked up. But the next period that we see is the 17, 20, which is just above 100. Very, very quiet, very quiet, which I do find slightly interesting. If we take a look at the volume, heavy, heavy call volume today, but a lot of that is sales, this will happen. Notice how this purple here, this is 13Ds. So these are people that are closing out their calls in this front expiration and potentially moving them into another expiration cycle. So the way we contract that is if you take a look, 181,000 calls, if we take a look at the front itself, that's 84,000. And then we can see 50, about 51,000 here and about 24,000 here. So there's a strong likelihood that a decent amount of the volume today was closing out front positions, moving them a little further out in time. Very, very common to maintain exposure to the stock itself. Now, taking a look at overall options flow, which you all know, this is more my world. This is what I pay very, very close attention to. We already talked about this slightly anomalous trade that we saw that was out in 17 April of 25, the 35s. Now,",

We already talked about this slightly anomalous trade that we saw that was out in 17 April of 25, the 35s. Now, it's labeled as none, no side, meaning we don't know exactly where it transacted. But if we take a look at the price, the price of transacted at was 540, the bid was 535 at the time, the offer was 575. And with the bigger trade like this in terms of size, way more likely that this would have been on the bid side. But we don't know, it absolutely could have been a purchase, meaning to open contracts. But it does look like this is probably more likely a sale of options as compared to a buy. That's what it looks like that also would line up pretty well with what we're seeing on the chart, meaning the stock has had a pretty big run up recently. So this absolutely would be very logical profit taking. But it's just it's a pure guess. I genuinely do not know. And as always, I don't like to share opinions with stuff like this. I much prefer to share objective information and then allow you to figure out what you think it is versus my perception of it. But we can see that the size here 3350. This isn't something that they",

This isn't something that they phased in or out of. So this was something that was able to float right across, meaning there was enough liquidity for this to go through as a bundle order, which is great. Now, the other thing that I did see people talking about with some of these 125s, one of the things to know with something like the 125 strikes is for a lot of different entities. This is used for managing risk. We call it units, unit building. And it's because you can buy a lot of options for a little amount of money that will have lower overall extrinsic value, although on a relative basis that they did a cable be very high.

And this is also a big reason why we continue to see the far out of the money's being populated both by my expectation, being institutions and retail traders alike. I don't think it's one of the other. I think it's both of them. And I think they both have their specific reasons for doing so. Now, for the retail trading perspective, it's typically a tough position to take on because retail traders tend to have smaller bank rolls. So then when they put on these positions that are very low hit rate, that's the nature of this style trade. This is the kind of trade that you put on 100 times and you expect it to hit twice, something like that. Now, for a smaller retail trader, if you put this on 100 times and you miss 60 something in a row, that can erode your bank roll, depending on how you're sizing the trades. For larger institutions, they literally amortize out how many times they expect to hit on some sort of move that they can monetize to make sure that they're positively expected. But the only way you can achieve that kind of risk reward profile and positive expected return from this is to have a large enough bank roll and size appropriately, which I think a lot of retail traders, unfortunately, don't do. So that's what we're seeing. Looks generally quiet, solid earnings, interesting close to",
