    "text": "Use a 30 day for our chart, GameStop. Notice anything about it? Anything special, anything stick out to you, other than the fact that it is parabolic up and right. It's gone from 20 and a half. It hit a high today of 28. I did a video on it yesterday, but I have to talk about it again simply because it's showing a lot of movement and the options markets are also getting heavily involved. There's a couple really important things I want to highlight as I look at this specific chart. Now, first and foremost, I don't do a ton of candlestick patterns, but I do look at candlesticks for the qualitative information that they can provide to us because they can do that. So, for example, if we look at a candle like this, it has a relatively small body where it opened here, closed here, and it obviously had much longer high and low wicks. What that tells me is that over the course of this candle's lifespan, which for those interested right now, again, it's a 30 day for our chart. So, it's a four hour time frame in this candle. It tells me that there is a really significant battle over price. It means that at some point, it opened here. It went all the way up to here, then enough sellers stepped in and then some to drive it all the way down somewhere towards here, buyers stepped in enough, and then they",

It went all the way up to here, then enough sellers stepped in and then some to drive it all the way down somewhere towards here, buyers stepped in enough, and then they reconciled down here. That's a different story than the second half of what you see today. So, this is the candle essentially from 1030 Pacific time into the close. It opened down here. Notice how it has no tail to the downside. That tells me that this is voracious buying pressure up until it started breaking above 28. Then it stepped into moderate cell pressure. Notice how this candle split almost 50-50. It's 57 by 43 cell in terms of volume. But all of that happened in here. So, this is still really extensive buy pressure. And we've seen this sustained over a few days now, which I find interesting. The video yesterday that I did literally was talking about the importance of 25. And I even said yesterday, I genuinely believed that it would break through 25, simply because of the way it acted here. It popped above 25, got pushed down just below. And it means lots of people happily unwinding that started happening today, but take a look at the expansion in volume still. We've gone from 5.5 million here. Now 15.9, 25.7. This is where things are busy. Now, I know a lot of GME community",

But for those like myself, again, I am very straightforward with you all. I have my positioning game stop, but I trade around game stop at the same time. The reason why I trade around it is because this kind of movement is really tradable. And again, in the video yesterday, I talked about the position that I built here in addition to my existing position, simply from the expansion of volume and trying to play at least a probabilistic move. And another note, people were asking, why did I enter here instead of something like here, or before when it looked like it was building a floor? And it's because I need movement. I'm a trader. This is how I make money is by trading. I need to realize the game in order for me to make money. That's how I live. So the issue with this is sometimes stocks can stay really quiet on these periods. So I don't like getting in during these for a trade. Now, if it's for a longer thematic position, it's completely different because this is showing you",

Now, if it's for a longer thematic position, it's completely different because this is showing you again, I didn't draw this line any time recently. This has been here for at least a month. And this we can see that there's a floor here. And whether or not it breaks through that floor is TBD, right? Price can always do whatever it wants. But the main point is that it didn't hear that's worth noting. So I enter here because it's a low risk trade in terms of how I structure the position. The risk on the position itself is set with an exit below this perceived floor, which is 2025 ish, something like that. I had gotten in at 2173. So it's about a point in a quarter of total risk, which is trivial. It's tiny. So then you can build a much larger position because the risk is managed to the downside and then see if you can get a bigger move. It's about creating an asymmetric payoff potential again for the shorter term aspect of the trade. So I wanted to talk about that. So I got literally two emails about it, which are great questions.

There's the structural perspective in terms of its manipulation and the way that its manipulation is somewhat predictable to a degree and how that can be traded. The second time frame or the second perspective is a shorter term time frame, which results around trading these kinds of moves. And then the third perspective is the longer term time frame where GameStop is now sitting on literally stock piles of cash slowly starting to reinvent itself as a business. And I cannot route hard enough for GameStop to get through all of its been through so far because this was almost another victim of seller boxing, which is just shitty. It's shitty that that is the thing in people are that fucking greedy. So I love it from a long term perspective, because it's doing a good job reinventing itself as like a legitimate business.

We'll stay here for three years. And for three years, the stock might do a ton, but we don't care. We're still here. And that's admirable because without that kind of support, GameStop would probably be in a different picture. But now it becomes an even more interesting story in my opinion because they just started the new branching out with card grading, which is really cool. Newton was teaching me about that, which is really neat. I don't do collectible cards. It's not really in my wheelhouse, but it's cool as a business line. And you can see that they're reinventing themselves. That's, you can't enjoy that enough. So we are seeing a really significant move here. That's what this comes down to. Take a look. Now it does look like the next serious volume node, right? We already broke through this one single day popped right above it. Didn't care off to the races.

And it's already breaking through it. So the interesting part here is as it breaks through this, there's really not a lot of overhead support that's in the market. Now the reason why overhead support or I'm sorry, overhead resistance. The reason why overhead resistance is so important is because overhead resistance comes in the form of again, all these different traders that got in at really high levels that are selling because there are people that got in at 50 that are just happy to have an opportunity to get out even at a marginal profit if they continue scaling in which a ton of people transacted in here. Look at the size of these candles and volume. Thousands and thousands and thousands of people were transacting in this entire range. So there's a good chance a lot of these people will look to unwind here. But so far, it doesn't matter. The buying pressure is showing up.

Take a look at the calls 420 literally can't make that up. 420,000 calls again, 77,000 puts incredible, incredible call volume on the day. What's even more interesting now to me is the fact that take a look at how many of these were bought over 30 likely were bought because you can't tell on the mid, but some of this mid is going to be bought. Some of it's going to be sold. So definitely over 30 will have been bought of this total volume. So there are there's massive massive influx of calls coming in and take a look. They're short dated. So if you take a look at these different strikes now, the 30s had 53,000 contracts trade today. We have the 25s at 33,846. So what does that mean? Well, if we come in here and we start to take a peak at if we start getting near the 30s, it gets really interesting because the open interest here on the 30s is literally about to double. The existing OI right now is 23k. There's 53 K transacted today. So at least half of that is going to port over to new trades. It doesn't look like there are a ton",

    "text": "gets really interesting because the open interest here on the 30s is literally about to double. The existing OI right now is 23k. There's 53 K transacted today. So at least half of that is going to port over to new trades. It doesn't look like there are a ton of trades that were closed. So the only risk I see here right now in terms of like really starting to build out a big move is this is still heavily predicated on underlying transactions driving this. And I say that because the total open interest in here essentially from the 27.5, 28, 28.5, 29 is very light. So we obviously saw a bit of a ramp happened here, not significant, but enough to edge price for sure through some hedging behavior. Because this in and of itself isn't going to cause massive hedging behavior 33,000 were traded today, but the 1452 that were added over Friday, not a ton of activity on that just yet. So what I'm looking for is to see what this materializes into because take a look at these 28s, 16,700 volume today against 3000 OI. It's moving after hours. Just ticked up almost to 28. If this 28 gets gobbled up, that starts to look pretty aggressive to me because these again are a little bit weaker, but there's been so much added here at the 30s that it's likely going to force some hedging behavior. There's still pretty low delta. So it wouldn't",

So the access to shares isn't going to cause a restriction just yet. And there's not enough in this options chain to like really force a true gamma squeeze, but it can absolutely add some pressure and I fully expect to see that. Now a couple of other things. Take a look here. We have some serious size entering the equation. So there's some really big trades going down, and this doesn't surprise me by the way. You see these out in 2025, how they're moving. These are people that establish these. I have trades that are further out in time, literally for these kinds of instances, because what you could do is you can get them on for pretty cheap. When you get your move, you can unwind part of your position to cover the remaining costs of your existing position. So it's literally a risk free trade. So that then you can hold on to it up until expiration with no issue. And if you get a giant move, now it's",

So that then you can hold on to it up until expiration with no issue. And if you get a giant move, now it's a true asymmetric payoff potential. So seeing some of these longer term options coming off doesn't surprise me at all. What I am interested in specifically though are what's happening with this near, near expiration, this upcoming op-ex. The reason why this matters so much is because this is where the near term pressure starts to come in. And we can see a few things. I want to make sure I'm not filtering by any size. It looks like we're good. And I'm sorting by premium. So we can see that there's a few 100,000 trades coming in today. The reason why these are actually a little more impactful than I typically would give credence to this size trade is because it's for this Friday. This is for a really short duration. So these are really strong trades that need movement and they need movement fast in order for them to really show a profit. So you have a thousand of the 27s here, a thousand of the 27s here. Again, it's really, really hard to see because this almost looks like they were offloaded here, right? So it could be somebody that bought a thousand, 1,55, another thousand at",

It's a little hard to tell. So this looks like some near term trading activity to me overall. The other thing I want to take a look at really quick is just the actual dark pool feed on shares and see if there's anything that jumps out at us here. I haven't looked at this yet. And a couple, let me sort this by premium. Yeah, I mean, there's some big trades coming through. This is a little bit more to this is over the last, I want to say like 90 days it's looking. So let's restrict this to today. And we have three of them, four of them that are over a million bucks. So there's, there's pretty significant overall share volume here. Now let's take a look over the last week out of curiosity. And you can see, yeah, the bulk of these larger trades are really focused on today. So I just wanted that for general context.

It looks like the stock definitely has some pretty significant volume stepping in no doubt. So next steps we need to see how this continues to run. I think one of the most important things to keep in mind is that this has pretty significant tailwinds right now, pretty significant tailwinds. And a lot of that stems from this. This is the Russell 2000 futures Russell 2000 IWM all of them looking at the same thing. But small caps are on a freaking tear. So this is finally adding wind to the back of GME, where for a lot of small caps, GME included, it's been wind in the face. And it's still been increasing slightly even in that contact. So on a longer term timeframe, this looks like the floor to me 19 and a half to the low side. It looks like about 20 and a half is being respected so far. And that's essentially been the case from the end of September. So we'll see where hopefully the Lord just continues to slide up on this thing because from a fundamental perspective, it kind of warrants some of it.
