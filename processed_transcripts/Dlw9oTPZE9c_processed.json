    "text": "Introduction to options. This is for new people interested in learning about options, how they can fit into your broader investing objectives. And my goal here is to find a sweet spot. I want to offer you what I consider to be important information with details without going overboard and overwhelming you. Options can seem incredibly overwhelming up front and it's just because it's a pretty steep learning curve, but I will assure you, if I've been able to figure this out, literally anybody else can. It just takes a little bit of time. There's a big language barrier little things like that, but they're great products and they can help a lot of people in different scenarios. Again, based on what your investing objectives are. So my goal here is to work through what options are, how we can think about them, some of their primary traits, and then how you can implement them in your broader investing objectives. So what's up everybody? Eric here. Welcome back to all the outliers. Let's talk about options. So in short, options are derivatives and there's lots of different derivatives out there, but retail traders very commonly will come into contact with two options and futures in this scenario. We are focusing on options as compared to futures and futures. We can get into in a future time. Ha ha, get the pun, but really it's just options are a little more accessible to people, a little bit smaller over product. And",

Ha ha, get the pun, but really it's just options are a little more accessible to people, a little bit smaller over product. And there's some rules that tie to options that make them kind of advantageous for a lot of scenarios specifically beginner strategies. So what is a derivative in short, a derivative is a product whose value is derived from something else. That's it. So in this scenario, we're just talking about products whose value is derived from something else. I'm going to use the D to a house as an analogy in just a minute, but just think of it that way. That you have an options contract and it's tied to an underlying security. This is any stock you can think of Apple Amazon Facebook or meta now, things like that. So what is an options contract? Why do we care about them? Well, we call them strategic investments. Actually, interestingly enough, my favorite author is Lawrence McMillan on options products. And he has a book called options as a strategic investment. It's my go to and it's because there are different aspects of a risk profile that we can manage with options contracts as compared to equities. When we trade equities, if you buy them, you want it to go up. If you sell an equity to sell short,",

When we trade equities, if you buy them, you want it to go up. If you sell an equity to sell short, you want it to go down so that you can cover lower options, give you a lot more control over that. And let's take a look at some of the things they allow you to do. They allow you to hedge positions. This means you can reduce risk and individual positions or reduce risk in an entire portfolio. You can gain access to leverage. So this means that you put up a smaller amount of money to control a larger amount of money. So let's say you put up a dollar, but you get to control 5. That's leverage. And it's good and it's bad. What do I mean by that? Well, if things go in your favor, it's a good thing because it means that you are using a little amount of money. That's behaving like a bigger amount of money. So you can make more money. But if things don't go in your favor, well, different story things hurt more because it's moving against you more.

But it is an important trade of options. It's why a lot of people use them because once you understand what you're doing, it's a more efficient way to trade a lot of things. Then we have the entire world of volatility trading. And I'm not going to go super far in a detail here, but just know that there are entire strategies that are predicated on trading, not just the directional movement of things, but the volatility of those things. So the beauty in that scenario is you can come up with non directional returns. So you can make money if something doesn't really go in your favor, but doesn't go against you too far. Or if something doesn't move a whole lot, there are strategies built around non directional returns and volatility trading is a big one and you'll find that in derivatives. You can trade them for income, which is actually kind of an important part here that a lot of people don't realize if you're trading an equities product. So let's say you buy a hundred chairs of a stock and it goes up. At that point, you have an unrealized game. You haven't made any money yet. All of the money, it's paper returns that's still in the account and the position is still open so you can lose",

All of the money, it's paper returns that's still in the account and the position is still open so you can lose all of it. But with options, you can create income on a principal balance without drawing down or neutralizing the overall principal trade, which is a really useful component of options. And then you also can trade all market conditions. So if markets are going up, if they're going down, if they're going sideways, you can trade options there. In equities, you need to trade either long, right? So things go up or trade short things go down. If it's going in your favor, but there's not really much you can do if things go sideways. Most traders get chopped up in those scenarios, because it's very difficult to make enough money in order to make profitable trades in sideways markets, but not so much with options. So back to that analogy I was referring to before, the deed of a house. So in this case, we have a seller who is a sick top hat in a cane. And then we have a buyer over here in green. And the house in this scenario represents the underlying asset. That is the thing that actually holds value. And the deed to a house is kind of like an options contract.",

It means for every option contract that's opened, there is a human being on the other side of that trade. It's an important note that we'll get into later, but that's important for you to understand early on. Now, if you think about the deed to a house, it inherently doesn't have really any value. It's just a piece of paper. But the deed is an important document that ties to an underlying asset, which does have value. So in this scenario, if we substitute deed with an options contract, and then the asset instead of a house, we have a stock. Again, like Apple, Amazon, meta, we have individual ETFs. So like spy or IWM. You are trading a contract that is tied to that asset. That's the only difference. Slightly different terms than a traditional deed, which we'll get into the terms of the contract. But that's it so far.

There's going to be a lot of language that comes up that you're unfamiliar with. And that's all OK. My biggest recommendation would be to take the video in bits, take notes along the way to try to define for yourself the terms that you don't know. And then rewatch the video as you develop your understanding. But don't be discouraged if you watch this video through one time, and you don't know what options are still. They are complex products, but they're entirely approachable over time. So my method of teaching stuff like this is to give you the vernacular, give you the definition of the vernacular. And then I'm just going to move on because you can rewatch that section as many times as you need. But I believe getting the terms and the context in your face as much as I can, it's going to increase your uptake. It's just like if you're trying to learn a language, the best possible way you can learn a language is just go to the country that speaks the language you're trying to learn. You won't understand anything upfront, but over time via context, you pick it",

It's just like if you're trying to learn a language, the best possible way you can learn a language is just go to the country that speaks the language you're trying to learn. You won't understand anything upfront, but over time via context, you pick it up. Same thing here. So let's get into it. I want to talk now about what actually is in the contract. So like I said, it's a contract between two people. And there are a handful of things that we define in an options contract. Now a quick admin note for those interested options now are all electronic. So there's not like a piece of paper that's sent to you or anybody. It's all done between you and your broker. And they just show up as little line items in your account. So there's not like an email that you get with the contract. It's literally just like if you buy shares of a stock and how it pops up in your platform, same thing is going to happen with an options contract. So what's in the contract? Well, we have the ticker. This represents the security or the underlying. You're going to hear me refer and flow between all three of those because they're synonymous in the trading world underlying security ticker. We have the type of option, which we're going to get into next, but there's only two types calls and puts calls and puts only two types",

Every options contract as an expiration. They're not good forever. So that is one of the strategic components of an options contract is that they are time bound. So if you're going to get a strike price, think of the strike price kind of like the sale price on a house. It's what you agree to the market price for the house may fluctuate. But you are agreeing to a specific amount up front. That's the strike price. Now this is where things slightly start to differentiate from the analogy of a D to a house. So you can actually buy and sell in options contract itself. So you can have this options contract. And this inherently has value because it gives people the right to an asset which also has value. So the options contract itself has value because it's slaved to the underlying asset. And it's kind of like if you're wholesaling houses or locating deals for people, that's common in the real estate world for those that don't know. So eventually it's kind of the same thing.

You can sell that deal to somebody else because it's valuable. There is a willing seller and you're connecting the two. It's kind of like the same thing with options contract. The premium is the value of the options contract, which we're going to go into later on how we calculate that what that means, all those sorts of things, no sweat, but just know that premium is essentially how much the options contract itself is worth. Now, there are a couple of important traits when we're talking about in options contract. Like I said, there's two parties. There's always going to be a buyer and always going to be a seller. So this means every single time an options contract is opened. Somebody has bought the position and somebody has correspondingly sold that same position. Now, for just general understanding, it's not always retail trader to retail trader. More often than not, there are entities called market makers. They take the other side of your trade.

The buyer has right. The seller has an obligation to deliver something and I'll get into those just a second, but just know that whenever you hear an option buyer, they have a right to something and then an option seller has an obligation to do something and it's again very similar to the real estate example. The buyer of the house has the right to the asset and then the seller has the obligation to sell the asset. Now, the only differences with options, you can buy or sell calls and puts and I'll go into in a second, what the differences are between those two different kinds of contracts, but that's the just so far.

That's it. But this is what it looks like. There's all these different dates. These are your different expiration cycles. And then if you open up one of them, we have all of these different strike prices. So 363, 364, 365, so on and so forth. And that's it. And you'll notice that there are puts tied to that strike price and calls tied to that strike price because you can trade either kind of contract. So going back over now to kind of some more details. I want to talk to you about calls and puts specifically because this is probably one of the more important concepts to understand when we're talking about options. So another thing I'm going to throw at you right away is new vernacular. So if you'll recall a second ago when I said that you can buy or sell to open.

    "text": "we're talking about options. So another thing I'm going to throw at you right away is new vernacular. So if you'll recall a second ago when I said that you can buy or sell to open. Another way we frame that or just a synonym is long or short. So long is synonymous with buying and short is synonymous with selling in this context. So if you buy a call, you can also be long a call. If you short a call, that means you sold a call. That's all. So if you buy, remember whenever you buy something, you have a right. It means you have a choice. So in this case, if you're long a call or if you bought a call, it means you have the right to buy an underlying asset at the strike price. So for example, let's say if you buy this 395 call in spy, it means that you now have just bought the right to buy spy at 395 regardless of where it's trading. And that's the important part of these. And it's also why options contracts have inherent value to them because they give you access to buy or sell things at specific prices when prices move. So to bring this example to full swing to give you an idea. If for example, you had bought the 380 call. It means that you have the right to buy spy at 380, even though it's already trading at 396. So it means",

It means that you have the right to buy spy at 380, even though it's already trading at 396. So it means that you're buying it 16 cheaper than where it is now. That's why there's a premium associated with each option. Because otherwise it would be arbitrage, right? Who wouldn't buy a 380 call and then exercise your option, meaning utilize your right to buy it at the strike price if it's at 380 and then just sell it at 396. So we'll get into more in the detail on how they actually work. But in short, that's how something like a long call will make money is if you buy, if you buy a call and then the underlying appreciates and value, it's a good thing. So that leads us actually to this part over here, which we'll get into in just a second, but I want to go through what happens if you short a call or if you sell a call. If you sell a call, it means you have the obligation to sell something in this case, it would be that underlying asset at that strike price. So notice how the buyer of the call has the right to buy shares at the strike price. Inversely, there is a seller to that call. They just have to",

So that's the difference between buying and selling from a contractual standpoint here. Now from a put side, if we think about calls, this is what people are used to seeing. People think I want to buy shares low and sell them high. That's like a typical stock transaction. So long calls typically resonate with people a little bit more. The thing with long puts or buying a put. It's kind of like if you're shorting stock, it means you have the right to sell something. And that might sound a little confusing because what are you selling? What if you don't have it? And we'll get into some of those details in just a minute, but just know that for puts, if you buy a put, you were buying the right to sell somebody something. And why does that matter? Well, it's kind of the inverse scenario here. Let's say that you bought a put when spy was trading up here at 412. Well, spy is crashed in price. So let's say that you bought a 412 put in spy.

So that's why people buy put sometimes they want to speculate to the downside. Sometimes they want to hedge additional positions that they have on, but it is essentially like shorting stock. It's when we want something to go down in order for us to make money. And then just like the example from a short call, a short put, it is the inverse of a long put. It means somebody has to buy it's just the other side of this trade. I've already broken out that you can buy to establish a position or sell to an established position. So in this case, you might be thinking why would somebody short a call or short a put. There are different strategies associated with these different hypothesis and we'll get into those a little bit later, but just know that there are reasons for people to do both based on a training hypothesis.

Now I want to talk to you about the traits of calls and puts in general because this will help solidify these scenarios the long and short. Calls appreciate in value when the underlying security goes up. So it's just like what that sounds like. If you have a long call or a short call, it doesn't matter. This is completely indifferent to your position. These are in general. So all of the calls over here will appreciate in value as the underlying asset goes up. The inverse happens when the underlying asset goes down. So again, to give you a quick example, if we come over here to spy, let's say we bought calls and then spy goes up in price. The calls all of them would go up in price. If spy goes down, all of the calls are going to go down in price, all of them across all explorations, they're all going to go down in price.

We have the underlying asset. I'm referring to it as a stock currently, but it could be a security ETF, ETN, whatever it is your trading. So there's the underlying asset value. And then there's the option value. The option value is tied to the performance and the behavior of the underlying that you're looking at. So I would throw two questions at you and see if you can answer them, throw them down in the comments. If you short a call and the underlying goes up, did your position make or lose money. That's the first one. The second one, if you buy a put and the underlying goes up, did your long put make or lose money. That's it.

The thing to remember is when we talk about the appreciation of the options, change themselves or the options themselves, the impact to your position is just, it's, it doesn't matter. That's going to be a function of whether you bought or sold the product, but calls are always going to go up when the underlying goes up and then call premiums are always going to go down when the underlying goes down and then it's inverse for that's all right, let's talk about a couple notes here. You're going to hear American versus European options when we refer to those we're talking about how those options can be exercised. And that leads me down here quickly to talk about the settlement of an options contract. You can either exercise or the opposite or I'm sorry, the corresponding part of exercise is if you bought an option, you have the choice to exercise. And if you've sold an option, you have an obligation to deliver on that option. So again, in this case, if you're long call and you choose to exercise, it means you get to buy something at a certain price and whoever is short that option has to sell it. And it's the inverse for puts. If you're long a put, it means that you have the option to sell shares of something at the",

It because the contract itself has value and more often than not, it's more efficient to just trade the contract as compared to taking assignment. It's baked into the pricing of the options.

Well, it's the inverse of whatever you do to open. So in this case, we have buy to open. If you buy to open, then you need to sell to close, which is down here. And it's just like an equity position. If you buy shares of a stock in order to exit, you have to sell the shares of the stock. What confuses people is the inverse. If you sell to open, you buy to close. So if you've ever shorted shares of stock, you know this inherently. But in this case, if you're not familiar with it, essentially, you're selling something up here at a higher value. So you're hoping to buy it back at a lower value. Now, this brings me back up here, though, to American versus European option, because remember, we did, we did a little rabbit dive into exercise and trading the contract for settlement. When we talk about American options, it means they can be exercised early. It means as long as the options contract is still open, meaning it hasn't hit expiration. It doesn't make sense to exercise all of them all of the time, but it can be European options can only be exercised at expiration. So it's a big difference.

And we'll get into the finances of it in just a minute. Now, let's talk real quick about lot sizes. When we're talking about these options contracts, you'll notice that this is the price, this is the bid, this is the offer, so this is how much somebody's willing to pay, this is how much somebody's asking to sell.

That's because of the option contract multiplier, you multiply these by 100, because each single contract is tied to 100 shares of the underlying, that's universal. It doesn't matter if you're trading spy, it doesn't matter if you're trading Apple. So if we pull up Apple and the, let's say the 150 call is trading for 5.20, it's not 5.20. So you have to multiply out, it's 525. So when we're talking about options contracts or lot sizes, it's important to remember the multiplier. So if I said I have a five lot of Apple, whatever calls, it means that I have rights to 500 shares. It's not five shares, it's 500 shares. So using that same example, if I wanted to buy a five lot of these 150 calls, it means that I would pay 520 per lot. So it'd be 520 times five, that would be how much I pay in general. And then it's the inverse. If you chose to sell the 150 calls, it means that you would collect, you would bring in that money, because you were selling to open.

If you chose to sell the 150 calls, it means that you would collect, you would bring in that money, because you were selling to open. And that leads me down here, actually, to what happens with money in these different scenarios. So for example, if I buy a call, I'm buying something money is going out, it is a debit, we call it a debit in options trading. If I sell something, it's called a credit, it means I'm receiving something to open the position. So a couple of terms that you're going to want to know is buy to open is BTO. And then the inverse of buy to open is sell to close STC. Then we have sell to open STO and then buy to close BTC. So these are the inverse transactions for one another. And whenever we're talking about options, if you're long an option, it means you BTO, you bought to open. If you sold an option to establish a position, you STO sold to open. And then the movement of money is exactly as I outlined, if you buy something, you are paying out. So you are giving somebody else money. That's a debit. And then if you're selling, you're receiving a credit. I already walk through explorations, but I want to give you a quick overview. You'll notice that there are some gray explorations and",

Standard expiration for options is the third Friday of the month. So actually Apple is a better example. If you'll notice 17 March is the third Friday of the month. So at the end of the market on 17 March after the market closes, they're going to process all of the options, chains. And then on Saturdays when they're settled, that's if you get assigned, if you don't get assigned, if you want to exercise or don't want to exercise all of that's process then again reminder, it can be exercised or assigned during the life cycle of the option, but it's rare. So now the other thing that I want to highlight are these additional explorations. These are weakly's. So what you're going to find is the more liquid products that are traded, meaning there's a lot of volume, a lot of shares. There's a lot of explorations and it's just because a lot of people like to trade different time frames.

But standard expiration is the third Friday of the month, but it's after the market closes normally. There are a.m. explorations, meaning in the morning. So you have to be careful with what you're looking at. There's not a ton of products that that work that way, but there are some. So if we look at SPX, notice how this one says, a.m. That means in the morning. So some slight differences in there, you're mostly going to see a.m. explorations in the big indices. So spx and dx rut, but it's just for your consumption. Most stuff you're going to trade is going to be an American option with a standard lot size, meaning a hundred share multiplier with different explorations, but it's going to be after the market. Something like spx actually is a European style option. It's actually cash settled. So there's no underlying that moves. This gets a little further into detail, but it's just important to know that there are slight differences.

Now I want to talk about the movement of equities very quickly. So if you buy a call, what does that mean? You have the right to do what? Answer in the comments below. If you've sold a put. What do you have the obligation to do? Based on those, we're going to go into some example on how these different positions make money, but it's important for you to understand not just how calls and puts behave as products themselves as in how they make money, but also what are the terms of the contract based on if you bought or sold the contract. All right, I would take a pause here if I were you and then we're going to move into premium and money, and I think the main thing for you to be able to answer in this section is what is a call? What is a put? How do calls behave when the underlying goes up and down? How to puts behave when the underlying goes up and down? And then those other two questions I just shared with you.

This is the value that's assigned to the options contract itself. Why doesn't options contract itself have value? Well, if you're a call, I told you that calls appreciate in value as the underlying goes up and puts appreciate in value when the underlying goes down. So if I buy a 4,000 call today for 43 or how much is that you got 4,300 if I buy this contract today for that amount, but then SPX goes up. It doesn't have to go past my strike for this value to go up as long as it goes up at all. This will start to move up and value. So now I have the right to buy something at 4,000, even though when I first bought it, it was only trading at 3970, but it started to move in my favor. So the reason why options contracts have inherent value by themselves is because they give you the right to access an underlying security at a specific price or the inverse if it's a put.

What does that put give you the right to do by the way for those that are taking the quizzes and commenting below what these mean. If I bought spy at 415 and I bought a 410 put, what does that mean? Well, the answer is it means I get to sell my shares of spy at 410 regardless of where spy is trading. So that becomes more valuable as spy goes down because even though spy is trading at 39626, I still have bought the right to sell my shares at 410. So somebody even though spy is trading at 396 right now, I have the right to sell mine at 410. That's why they have value. So when we talk about the premium of an option or the options value, there's kind of two main branches here. We have intrinsic and extrinsic value. Intrinsic value is how far something is in the money, which we're going to get into in just a second. And then extrinsic value is time value. So one of the things to note",

    "text": "the options value, there's kind of two main branches here. We have intrinsic and extrinsic value. Intrinsic value is how far something is in the money, which we're going to get into in just a second. And then extrinsic value is time value. So one of the things to note is that all open options will have extrinsic value because they haven't expired yet. So as long as they haven't expired, there's going to be time value in the options. Intrinsic value is it only pertains to options that are in the money. So what does in the money out of the money mean? Well, it's slightly different for calls and puts. These are the protocols here. So you can kind of take the notes and then I'm going to work through them with you. This is literally not going to make any sense to you the first 10 or 15 times you hear it. Do not worry about it. Just listen to what I'm talking about and then just conceptualize the positions and why the value changes the way it does. So when an option is in the money, when we're talking about calls, notice how these calls here are great out and then these ones are kind of clear. They're just a black background. And then it's inverse for puts. It's because they're inverse when they're in the money and out of the money. So in this example, when K stands for the strike price, S stands for",

But in this example, spy was trading at 391 49. This is the security price. If we look at this 392 call over here, if we look at this 392 call, that is our strike price. So is 392 greater than 391 49. In that case, the answer is yes. So in this scenario, that option is out of the money. So when we're talking about calls, this is what determines moneyness. If our strike price is above the security price, it's out of the money. If our strike price is below the security price, it's in the money. What does in the money mean? Well, again, same scenario. 391 49 is a security price right here. Then we have, let's use this 390 call right here. Is 390 below 391 49? The answer is yes. That means it's in the money.

All you do is take the security price minus the strike price. Then you get your intrinsic value. So in this scenario, if we have our 390 strike, which is right here, and our security is trading at 391 49, you tell me, what's the intrinsic value of that 390 call? If we take the security price of 391 49, we subtract 390. We get 1.49 of intrinsic value. So if we look at the option right now, it's not right now. When I took the screenshot, it was trading around 1020 call it. So the premium is 1020, which is not actually 10.20. It's 1,000, right? Move the decimal place over twice. So it's 1,020. So you have that 1020. You're going to subtract the intrinsic value, which we just calculated is a dollar 49. So out of that 10 and 20 cents in this options contract. 1.49 of that is intrinsic value.

Now at the money is a little more loose, but essentially we refer to as the products that are one strike in and one strike out of the money as at the money. It means that they're trading those two strike prices are trading right around where the underlying itself is trading. So these we call at the money. And then the stuff that's further away, we call them in the money or out of the money. So let's move over now to puts very quickly. For puts, it is just the inverse. Everything is going to be flipped. So if the strike price is greater than the security price, it's in the money. So in this case, we have this 392 strike price. The security is trading at 391.49 is 392 greater than 391.49. Yes, it is indeed. So that is in the money. And then it is the inverse for the out of the money stuff. We have a 390 strike price here.

You could throw it in your notebook. If you can answer the question and a quick reminder on the answer. Intrinsic value is how far something is in the money. Extrinsic value is how much time value is left in an option. Now there's something important to note here. Notice how I said as time passes, the extrinsic value of the option is going to contract because at expiration, when we have no more days left in the contract, no more time left in the contract,",

Notice how I said as time passes, the extrinsic value of the option is going to contract because at expiration, when we have no more days left in the contract, no more time left in the contract, there's no more time value to be assigned to an option. So that means if something is out of the money, it's going to assimilate to zero. And I can show you what that looks like. So if we come back over here to spy, let's go far out in time. If we look at this 325, 19 Jan options chain, you can see that the out of the money options here, the 390 put is trading for 2250, the 400 call is trading at 33 something like that. Now let's move in closer and I'm going to use the one strike at the money for both the 395 call is only trading for 6.56 and then the 396 put is trading for 6.74 notice how much less these numbers are was because there's way less time in those options. The longer an option has in its lifespan, the more value it has assigned to it because the contract spans a longer time frame. So let's take a look now at something that's even closer. We can look at something that expired today. Notice how all of these are zero. These are out of the money. Notice how all of",

Notice how all of these are these are zero to it's essentially right at the money, which is why there's a tiny bit of value, but that's gone now. Notice how all of these are zero. Now notice how these are going to be relegated to just the intrinsic value. So you could do the math. If spy here closed at 39626 and these are trading for this is a 395 call, you can do the math to see what the intrinsic value is. So sometimes these won't line up neatly and it's because at expiration, there's a lot of weird funky things that are going through the brokerage platforms as they're clearing, but that will be the intrinsic value. So an important differentiation between these two is intrinsic value remains after an option expires. There's still intrinsic value. It's an important note. Now when we're talking about extrinsic value, notice how I've been referred to as time value, because that's just how much time is left in the option. There's some important details when we talk about that. And I want to get into that right now. So when we're thinking about this premium, how how do we come up with this? Is",

So when we're thinking about this premium, how how do we come up with this? Is it just a random number that falls from the sky? How do we determine the premium of an option? Well, there are different pricing models that are used. Black sholes, Merton model is a common one you're going to hear binomial trees. There's lots of different ways you can price options. The most important thing for you to know as a new options trader is its consensus driven. So some big institutions are going to use all their crazy PhD think tanks to price options as perfectly as they can. Then they're going to go to the market with a bit in an offer. That is how options are priced. They're going to be priced based on the collective consensus of people. So what I mean by that is if we come over here. And we find something that has a little bit of time left. Let's use this 14 March. This 395 put or let's use this 396 call, which is trading for 6.20 something sense. This is the bid and the offer from the nearest to market participants. That's the value. So what I'm highlighting here is most of the time when we're trading options, we try to",

So what I'm highlighting here is most of the time when we're trading options, we try to get filled at what we call the mid, which is the midpoint between these two, the bid and the ask. The bid and the ask are kind of the two points where you will get a fill very quickly. So if you want if you want to buy something and you buy it at the ask, you're going to get a fill and then kind of the inverse for the bid. Now the thing with consensus driven models is it really is predicated on what people think things are worth. So don't worry about how all the math goes into creating an options price. There are lots of resources being deployed to price options fairly. So I think that's what I'm saying said there are niche markets that reward good options pricing. You're not going to get to that for quite a while as a new options trader. So I wouldn't waste your time running down that path.

I'm not going to go into detail on all this. I'm just showing you how this model prices options. And the thing with the BSM or black sholes, Martin model is it has some shortfalls that has assumptions baked into it that we know are not true. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go into the next one. Which is volatility remains constant across explorations. It's not true. We know it's not true. But we still use this as a theoretical starting point. And then all of these different entities price options using all of their tools. And then we come to a consensus. But you'll notice that a lot of times this isn't that far off. So this is what is the price of the underlying that we're talking about. So in this example, spy is 39626.

So different entities use different benchmarks for the risk free rate. Most of the time it's very short term bonds. So that's what we're going to use for the risk free rate. Then we have the yield. If the underlying pays a dividend, this is really going to impact the calls a bit more. But it also impacts the puts because when something pays out a dividend, we know it drops by the dividend. So the original black sholes, Merton model didn't include dividend, but we've adapted it since to include it. But yeah, it's just for your consumption. This is the big one. And this is why it's in yellow. And this is also why I have it here. Faultility. We know the underlying price. We know the strike price. We know how far out in time it is.

And this is going to dive into beautifully what we're talking about next. But before we do that, I want you to explain to me what is intrinsic value and what is extrinsic value. And then I also want to know when something when an option expires in the money, does it have extrinsic value with that. Let's dive into this curious yellow one, which is volatility. In short, volatility is variance. It's how much something moves. And we use this in statistics in general, but you've heard the term volatile weather before the markets are volatile. That just means things are moving a lot. So as volatile as volatility is higher, it means that there's a higher variance in price or whatever it is that we're observing. So when we're talking about the markets, there's really two types of volatility we're going to be talking about implied volatility. In historic or realized volatility implied volatility. We typically market as IV and then historic volatility as HV implied volatility is pretty simple. It's what we think things are going to look like in the future. As you guessed, it's a forecast. It means we are guessing what things are going to look like going forward. As you probably could imagine, if you've ever seen the volatility in weather predictions pretty wide,",

But in implied volatility, that's the name of the game. We are trying to forecast what we think volatility is going to be. That's implied volatility. What does that matter? Why does implied volatility matter? Well, think of it this way. If I wanted to trade an options contract in spy and I think things are going to be super volatile, meaning they're going to go up real high down real low. They're going to move around a whole lot. It means I probably don't have a good feel on where it might land. How it's going to impact my options position. If volatility goes up, the premium for options contracts, calls and puts goes up. It's because there's more unknowns. So for anybody to sell those options, they're going to demand more compensation for those options.

And you can see all of these implied volatility's they're different for the same strike across different explorations and then they're different for calls and puts.

It's why options have any outstanding value is because the future is unknown. So people are willing to buy things to hedge their risk. People are willing to speculate on that unknown because of leverage. All of it is based out of volatility. So quick recap question thrown in the comments below. What is implied volatility? What is historic volatility? Now I want to talk to you just a little bit more about this relationship. So when we have the premium listed for any sort of option, we already know that there's intrinsic and extrinsic value. You are an expert in that at this point. Now, extrinsic value as we already know is simply time value and time value has these components. This is important to know. These are intimately tied to one another because the longer the duration of the options contract, the more room volatility has to play. So if we expect the variance of something, do you think the weather will vary more in two days or 180 days, probably 180 days. It's the same thing with options",

    "text": "to one another because the longer the duration of the options contract, the more room volatility has to play. So if we expect the variance of something, do you think the weather will vary more in two days or 180 days, probably 180 days. It's the same thing with options contracts. So when we have longer time frames, one options premiums are going to be higher because the contract is longer duration. I want to be compensated as a seller for the duration of a contract in that same vein. When you add volatility into that equation, if something has a longer runway for the contract itself, we expect more variance in the underlying itself. If the default volatility tends to be higher, so it is why you're going to see more often than not. If we look at these shorter term options, like this 14 days to expiration, and we look at this 396 call, again, it's trading for 620. If we go out here to 325 days, it's not even listed, but it's essentially trading for 30 something like that because it's between these. Another important note though, notice how I went further out in time that we moved from 1 expiration to 5. So in this shorter term expiration, they're listed at 1, the strike prices, but out here it's at 5. That is for liquidity. Because we get further and further out in time, they're typically are going to be fewer strike prices, and it's so",

Because we get further and further out in time, they're typically are going to be fewer strike prices, and it's so that more people participate in those existing strike prices, because if there's too many, there's not a lot of liquidity. So what's going to happen here is 325 days out, they're only offering 5 wide strikes, but then as you start to getting closer, you'll notice that there's 1 wide strikes. Not abnormal, it just means as time passes, an additional expiration cycles open up, that's where you're going to see dollar increments, at least in the spy, that'll happen in some different products, just kind of an interesting side note. Okay, so talk to me about premium specifically volatility. When we're pricing an option, do we use implied volatility or historic volatility? Again, throw it on the comments below or write it in your notes, but that is an important differentiation and volatility is the heart and soul of derivatives. Cool. So moving on now to the second to last piece, which is the Greeks, I want to talk to you very quickly about the first order Greeks. There are second order and even third order Greeks, I actually have some older videos on those, but they're way less pertinent to us as traders. So I'm not going to",

And if there's interest, you could throw it in the comments below and I'm happy to take a look. So let's talk about the Greeks. We have a handful, we have Delta gamma theta Vega row, which interestingly enough, these are not all from the Greek alphabet. It's kind of a misnomer. Some of these are actually not from the Greek alphabet, funny enough, but we call them the Greeks. So Delta gamma theta Vega row, these are simply metrics that we observe to understand how different traits of an options contract will move. So notice up here, this is Delta gamma theta Vega row, then Delta gamma theta Vega row. And you can tell that there's differences depending on how far out in time you go or how far in the money or out of the money you go. And also a difference if it's a call or a put. So this goes pretty deep and there's actually going to be some homework for you on this one. And what I'm going to tell you to do is pick a stock,",

And what I would recommend is you do a seven day expiration here, a 30 day expiration here, a 60 or 90 day expiration here, a 180 day expiration here. And then a 365 day expiration plus over here and write these out for all of them. That is the best possible way that you are going to understand the relationship between these things.

But once you understand some of these different traits, it'll make a little more sense. So Delta is the premium rate of change per one point move in the underlying. So if we come over here and let's take a look at calls first and we go to Delta. This is a Delta of 50. This means that for every 1 move in spy 1 up, we're going to make 50 cents on the premium. If spy goes down by a dollar means this is going to lose 50 cents. The other thing you'll notice is that all in the money options have Delta's of 50 or more. All things that are further the further out of the money you go, the lower your Delta goes, the further in the money you go, the higher your Delta goes. And that's for calls and puts.

What do I mean by that? Well, if this is a one lot, meaning we're only trading one contract and spy moves a dollar. Well, why don't if it's 100 shares, why doesn't it move by one? Well, it's because over the life of an option, the Delta changes. That's one of the strategic components to these is there's benefits and drawbacks to that. But let's say for example, you wanted it to behave just like stock. Well, you could buy a call that's like a 90 Delta or even a one Delta. And it would be cheaper than buying shares of stock, but it would essentially move dollar for dollar with the stock. So Delta itself, though, just tells us the rate of change of the premium of an option. Now notice over here though Delta is negative. So when we're looking at Delta, we're talking about a plus one dollar move. And that's why this is negative. So this means if again, spy goes up one dollar, this call is going to gain 50",

So this means if again, spy goes up one dollar, this call is going to gain 50 cents in premium. This put is going to lose 50 cents in premium. Why is that? Remember way back when I said, if an underlying goes up calls appreciate and value. But underlying goes down calls depreciate and value or puts up appreciate and value. That's why these are marked as is. So what then happens if spy goes down by a dollar, it means that this put is actually going to gain money. And then this call is going to lose money. So that's Delta. The other way we use Delta as a rough probability of an option expiring in the money at expiration. It's not perfect, but it's pretty close. The probability components of options is one of the hallmarks of them because there are probabilities for everything. So notice how this 396 put has a Delta of 49. But the probability of it being in the money at expiration is 50.97. So slight variance. And then you'll also notice that it kind of changes depending on how far out of the money you go, the degree of the variance. So you can calculate based on option pricing and where the underlying is currently priced. What is the",

So you can calculate based on option pricing and where the underlying is currently priced. What is the probability that that underlying is going to be in different places? That's just using what we were talking about before, volatility. You can make a forecast on where things are likely to go. And you can apply that same thought process to the pricing or to the analysis of options. So that's why we can use Delta as a rough approximation. It's not perfect. You actually have to do the math. But back when I showed you the premium down here, there's actually you this is baking in probability, right? That's what this sigma is different standard deviations over time. So when we're talking about Delta, it tells you the rate of change in premium per dollar move in the underlying. It also can be used to understand out of that the total size that you have in that one contract. Or if you have two contracts, it doesn't matter how many lots you have. So, but let's say if you have a one lot, it means you have a maximum exposure of 100 shares in this scenario. Your position is behaving like 50 shares.

Gamma is just the rate of change of Delta. And there's a couple of things to know with gamma. So if we look at options and right now we're 17 March, so 17 days out notice Delta. Further out of the money you go, the lower the Delta at the money, it's going to be around a 50 Delta, deep in the money around a one Delta. That's going to be the same across every single expiration, no change. Now, let's take a look at gamma 17 days left to go notice a couple things. The first thing is the further in the money you go, low gamma, then we start getting closer to at the money higher gamma, then the further out of the money you go, lower gamma.

That's an important understanding. So when we look at gamma in terms of an options, money, this if you are deep in the money or deep out of the money. Your gamma is going to be low with a increasing gamma the closer you get at the money. Now, let's take a look at some specific values very quickly. Gamma for the at the money options here is 0.02. Let's go something even closer in time one day out. Gamma here is 0.08. Four times higher and it's essentially two weeks closer a little more. Now, if we go further out in time, 171 days gamma for at the money is 0.01. 50 lower than where it was before. So what I'm showing you here is gamma increases the closer you get to expiration. Why does that happen? Well, remember, when I told you that options that are out of the money are going to assimilate to 0. So this means as we get closer to expiration, the option has to make a choice. If it's out of the money, it's going to go to 0. If it's in the money, it's going to go to 1. So it's got to have a corresponding gamma so that that can happen in that amount",

Then we have theta time decay. This is a really important one. So when we think about time decay, there's two traits I want to highlight the first one. If we go to theta and we are at the money, notice how high it is. So if I do something that's seven days out, theta for at the money is 26 cents. If we're far out of the money, it's lower just 0.2 cents. And if it's far in the money, it's super low, either zero, meaning there's no extrinsic value left essentially. Or there's is very low. So like gamma, if theta is going to be the highest for at the money options. And it's going to be lower for out of the money options and lower for in the money options. And then theta in general is going to be higher the further out in time you go. And it's because there's more time left in those options.

However, theta decay, which is what theta is actually measuring here. It's not how much time values in the option. It's measuring the decay of time value. So in these instances, theta will be low. And it's because it has a long runway. So each day, these options are only going to lose 0.03 cents. And notice how the theta is slightly different for calls and puts that typically is going to be based on the delta. So if you look at a corresponding similar delta, this 42 delta, the theta is 0.03. If you look at this corresponding delta, the theta is 0.01. Further out of the money options are going to decay much slower than closer to them, then closer to expiration options or two options that are far out or in the money. So if we go far out in time, theta is going to decay slower or if we go far in or out of the money. Then we have Vega, which is the rate of premium change per 1 change in volatility. Remember how I was telling you that volatility is a big input in an options price. So this tells us as volatility changes over the life cycle of an option, what is the premium rate of change?

So this tells us as volatility changes over the life cycle of an option, what is the premium rate of change? How much is the premium going to change based on the movements in volatility? That's Vega. And then row, this is going to be less applicable to most shorter term options traders within a year. But in a year like this or last year with a lot of rate changes, it's actually more pertinent. And this is how premium changes or the value of an option changes per change in the risk free rate. So as the risk free rate fluctuates, the premium of options, especially longer dated options will fluctuate a little bit more, that will be a little less applicable to most people. All right. Where do we go from here? A couple of things. I think you should get options as a strategic investment. I have no vested affiliate link anything with this guy. I just really like his book. It's what my mentor turned me on to. And I think it is one of the best resources for option traders. Two, you should join our free discord.

It's yes, invests the outlier a go get you can find the link in the video description below. Now, I think you should take a look at some strategies. There's a lot more detail that go into options as you probably can imagine. I literally have been talking for an hour and 17 minutes straight about them. And this is scratching the surface. I started trading options in 2007. I've been doing this for over 16 years. I have spent probably 35,000 hours on it now. I'm still learning that's not to overwhelm you. It's just to let you know that there's a lot out there and you should take a very pragmatic approach. So beyond going through the homework that I shared throughout the video, I think you should start looking at some simple strategies. Something like a ratio covered call link in the video description below the coverage triangle. Same ratio diagonals also same. I think you should avoid if you're new to trading options trading any sort of real money for the foreseeable future. If I were you, I would make a commitment to yourself to not trade options for at least six months. Sounds like a long time, but I promise you it's a drop in the bucket and it takes time to pick them up. The worst thing you could do is try to rush into",

Sounds like a long time, but I promise you it's a drop in the bucket and it takes time to pick them up. The worst thing you could do is try to rush into them like we all do and most people lose a shit ton of money unnecessarily to learn stupid lessons. So I think you should start looking at those strategies and then building out a trading plan, a trading log strategy outlines all of that is in the video description below. But options are fantastic products with a lot of opportunities in them, but they're complex. As you can see, we just ran through some of the basic traits of them. There's even relationships between the Greeks when we talk about things like that that's in a vacuum just by itself, but really things move more than that. So I hope this was useful. Please like share subscribe if you made it to the end. This is a long video for me the longest one I've ever made here to date. And I'm stoked with it though. I'm hopeful that it's useful to you guys. And if there's any questions that you have thrown in the video description below or in the comments below said video description too many times. I'm just repeating it, but throw it in the comments. I'm happy to hope where I can. But until next time",
