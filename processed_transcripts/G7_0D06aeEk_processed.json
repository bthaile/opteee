Notice this red line, which is like a three-day correlation. If you look at that, and then if you look at the, what is that salmon color? Like the five-day correlation we'll call it salmon. Both of those, effectively from the 20th, have been skyrocketing positive. And I actually use the really short term as a leading indicator for the slightly longer term duration, although all of it is very short term in its idea. But this is another pairs trade that I traded specifically between comm services and tech. And the main ideas here are finding these distortions and the normalizations of relationships. And there are just a lot of those opportunities that exist right now. So if you're unfamiliar with those, definitely worth hopping into chat GPT, spend it a little time getting more familiar with them because there's some pretty solid opportunity between those. Will says, what trading software do you use? This is Thinkorswim. So this is from Schwab. Thinkorswim also has like a mobile app. I'm not sponsored or anything by them.

But Thinkorswim is just the platform that I happened to have started on when I first started trading in 07. So I use it primarily for that reason, just because I'm supremely familiar with it. But it doesn't really do anything that's like highly novel to anything else. I'm not super familiar with trading view. I'm slowly tinkering with it more because I know other people do when I want to have a working relationship with it. But in general, Thinkorswim is pretty solid, but any of the main brokers tend to have the own versions of the platforms that are pretty good. Like Fidelity Pro, I used that for a while when I was trading a 401k. And like that was completely fine. So yeah. Okay, cool.

You just have to ignore your DMs. They don't have to, but you could talk to the bots if you feel like it. But essentially we had somebody that was talking about two different ideas. And I actually really liked this question because this gets to literally the heart and soul of what it is to be a trader. Our job as a trader is to find different market effects. I refer to them as profit mechanisms that we can monetize, that we can make money off of.

It's obviously more than that. But let's just call it a 10 return. Over the this time frame, this represents a 10 return. Now even though this represents that positive 10 return, you'll notice that there are periods where things move differently. So this has a negative slope, this has a positive slope.

Why are there periods that the slopes are different, that the directions are different, those kinds of things?

When we are attempting to trade this, when we are trying to trade the news, what are we trading? This goes back to the way that I encourage you all to think about the market and to think about trading. Use a specific process, you all will be relatively familiar with this process. The reason why I'm calling this out to you is because when we're thinking about something like trading the news, we know that there's kind of an effect that we're attempting to capitalize on, but we have to get specific. We have to know what we're actually trying to trade so that then we can attempt to trade it logically. So when we're trading something like news, just like everything else we talk about, not all news is created the same. There are news categorizations that are going to have different level impacts than other news. So let's apply the standard process that we talk about all the time. So in this case, step one, the profit mechanism that we're attempting to trade here is direction. This can be up or down depending on what the news is. Now if we were to",

If you think about something like news, it's ingested very fast. The news comes out and then we kind of see what everybody thinks about it and how that impacts the stock. And you can see that happen when things go through those big swings. So the profit mechanism type in this case literally is information integration. So what this means is we're thinking about how this new information is going to impact the potential direction of the stock. Okay, great. Now we're onto something. We're on a standardized process to help us think through how to trade these kinds of effects. So let's take it to the next step. As we're thinking about the integration of new information into an equity price, we already arrived at the fact that not all information is created the same. If there's information, I get all sorts of alerts all days of all day of all kinds of stuff from insiders selling some of their positions and that can",

It's going to make it more expensive for them to do business. That's going to hurt them. However, that information existed until new news broke out today and yesterday that Trump is talking about ways for them to be exonerated and for there to be a delay in the impacts of those tariffs.

Well, guess what? Our job is traders, Bayesian analysis, updating our mental models based on new information, new information came out. There's potentially another stay on those tariffs for another duration and really it's to give them an opportunity to set up infrastructure domestically so that they can minimize the impact of those tariffs. This is one single example of this. So if we think about this generalized profit mechanism of trading ingestion of information, what I'm trying to help you understand is that it's completely viable, but you have to be thoughtful around how you break it down into what relevant time frames matching the kind of ideas. So if I tried to trade, for example, the announcement of the tariffs, which I did, there's essentially two ways you can trade it. You can trade the initial response to the tariffs being announced and then you can trade the longer term inclusion of the tariff impacts into the market. So that's using this one for an example.

This is the thing I talk about all the time. Post earnings announcement drift is the inclusion of brand new information that comes out during an earnings release. It takes different durations in order for it to come to fruition. But based on my notes, there are different conditions that lead to different subsequent moves from post earnings announcement drift. So things like the earning surprise magnitude as an impact on the follow on effect, things like investor attention, how many analysts cover the stock impacts. The characteristics of the stock with respect to things like market cap value stocks tend to exhibit more drift tendencies. Earnings persistence, the number of prior shocks impacts future shocks. The behavior of individual investors, specifically the way that they follow news cycles can impact those shocks. Another one that a lot of people don't actually know about, which I think is, no, not this one. Yeah, this one value glamour and anomaly.

So again, to give you an example, one thing that I know with certainty is that if I look at just about any stock, let's look at Nvidia, I know that if I go to these different earnings periods, there's going to be bigger price velocity around it, very persistent. So then there are other effects to this same idea that we can trade. We can trade the various conferences that Nvidia participates in throughout the year. We have to look at prior conferences and see which conferences had, or you could just plot it on a time series. You could say for the past three years, use chat GPT, use AI to help you. That is, I will always reiterate this point. If you are not using that to help with everything you're doing as a trader, you literally are falling behind at a rapid rate. Because the easiest thing you could do is go to your research analyst, aka chat GPT and be like, yo, list all of the different conferences and presentations Nvidia has given at industry events and just events over the last three years. You can then plot it on a time",

And then now you know based on what the event is, what is the standard price movement around that event? And this is exactly how we trade these kinds of ideas. So then to go back to this question one more time and to fully wrap up the point, if we think about trading something like the Trump agenda, we need to think about what the Trump agenda is. So one of them we know is literally trade wars. We know that there's tariffs going out and we know that there's going to be reciprocal tariffs if other people tear us back. That will match. So this is an escalating thing. I would fully expect things like Ford GM, those kinds of companies are going to struggle in that kind of environment. So if we go, I haven't looked at Ford. So I'm actually eager to see how they're doing. This news doesn't surprise me. So this news came from the announcement and the launch of the tariffs.

So you literally can trade that kind of impact. Another company that's going to be susceptible to all this conversation is GM and it will probably look the same as Ford. Shocker. Another company that's going to be really susceptible to something like this is Apple. Apple is announced a massive investment in the US like 500 billion or something if I'm not mistaken. And it's because they produce all of their shit in way cheaper places. So if these tariffs go through, that's going to negatively impact Apple. It's going to take them some time in order to get the infrastructure in place domestically to reduce the impact of those tariffs. So a lot of the market movement you're seeing is not just an artifact of the tariffs, but it's also an artifact of the drug deals that all of these companies are attempting to arrive at with Trump, meaning if I do this, can we hold off on the tariffs for another month? The thing to remember about Trump is that he's a deal maker. It's business. It's what he does. So he's probably always willing",

So the way that we trade something like the Trump agenda is we have to break out the Trump agenda into its core tenants. Again, I'm reviewing one of them right now with you, which is the trade wars. Another is deregulation. Another is drill baby drill. Another is decreased investment into renewable energy. There's a ton of ideas like this that exists. You can use things like the tax cuts. Look at what industries are most likely to be positively impacted by the tax cuts. What's likely to happen to the price of oil if we're going to not only produce domestic production, but then OPEC is also producing domestic production. Guess what? That means you fade oil because it's going to crater. Easiest trade on earth. It's just paying attention to the information that's coming out and then coming up with supporting ideas that capitalize on it. But this is the cheapest.

You put the trade on because if we zoom this out longer term, take a look at where oil is. It's effectively at like 23 peak lows. Another thing to know about oil though and other commodities is they tend to have a floor. You can also trade from a pot odds perspective, the relationship that something is to the perceived floor that we think may or may not exist.

Take a look at the movement here. That's not immediate at all. We can see that price leveled off here and then effectively from 5 a.m. up until 9 a.m. is where that move happened. So it's not really immediate. No, that's whatever you're dealing with really big systems like this, it's going to take time inherently because what moves the price of things is not just the information.

Like this price move literally took hours to fully come through. So yeah, you have plenty of time. Alberto says, how about news related to mergers and acquisitions? How does one trade that sort of news? Yeah, so the cool part is you can learn all about that effect based on the announcement and based on the total, based on the total perception of what it is.

I don't know how to spell the fucking other thing. I don't know if we'll see if chat you can get me right. I think it's something like. OK, or it could just not search things. I want to know, that was right. That was good. So I see it from them coming through on. This looks like",

So this came on the 20th. Let's take a look at what happened to stock price on February 20th here. Because a really, really common misconception is that for the acquisition, the lay approach is you short the acquireer and then you buy the acquire E. So in this case of Celsius, is the one acquiring a long new, which I don't even think a long new is. It's not even publicly traded. So you would essentially just go short Celsius. But obviously if you do that through earnings, you get your face ripped off. So the thing to pay attention to with respect to mergers and acquisitions is that not all news is created the same. And the perception of the likelihood of it going through matters, but then also the price matters a lot. Again, this is the problem with like blanket statements. And again, it's really common. Most people will tell you you short the person that's acquiring the company that's acquiring and you buy the one that's being acquired. But guess what",

And somehow that goes through for X, Y and Z reasons will guess what happens in that scenario. The stock price is actually going to collapse of the company being acquired because of that reason.

We can look through a couple examples right now because it's kind of fun. Let me see if I can find MNA filter. This one's FDA. That's insiders which I don't really care about.

I can tell you that the probability is positive skewed based on the tails of it out here. And those kinds of things. So that's how you do that. We'll say short acquire long acquire. Yes, see, that's exactly what I was talking about before. Most people will say that. And it's not inherently wrong, right? Like it that's like a generalized way to look at it. The problem is is it just misses all nuance. And if you trade on that idea, you'll lose money actually quite a lot. There's a couple really important factors to bake into the decision. Will says, do you have any data subscriptions for minute by minute news, order flow, etc. I do mostly because I'm an affiliate for a couple entities that I like. I'm not really an affiliate",

Depending on your style is you can get the information directly from a platform, right? Because almost all the platforms are going to get the information from the same places. There's a couple key data vendors and news vendors that they all pull in from. So from a news ingestion perspective, you can kind of get equal level news from most places. You really don't have to pay for that. When it comes to things like order flow, that depends entirely on what kind of order flow you're talking about. And then what you're trying to do with it because there is a latency component to that. But things like bar chart, I don't know if like their free version of it allows you to set those kinds of alerts. But I know their paid version does because they they allow me to use it.

If we take a look at VIX. And let's take a look at just a bunch of different, a bunch of different chains. And if we just kind of eyeball, looks like the volume is in populating for some reason, because the market's closed probably. If we take a look, for example, in the change in open interest, we can see a lot of the open interest is in like the tens of thousands. So then if we just eyeball the price of these, right, so let's say this is 10,000 at what's the midpoint here like 85 is.

Including the consensus. And actual. And then you can also get this from the BLS your labor statistics. They'll have it. Well, I just want I'm not really just curious of chat GPT can do it. But anyways, this is exactly the process I would follow. And then next step would be to include the date here. For the different releases. It just gave me three dates. So before I go any further, one of the very first things I need to do is validate that this information is even moderately accurate. This is what GPT gave me. We forgot this column. It's screwed it up one sec. Stop this. And now. I just want to fact check it because anything that I can get from chat GPT. I will not take it at face value. And I need to make sure that it's actually accurate. So we'll squish this down. And effectively what we're looking for these last release dates for unemployment. So which was seven feb. So let's go. The last month. And let's go to seven feb. And then there's unemployment. It got it at 4.0 versus 4.1. So it's accurate. I'm not even going to lie. I'm actually kind of surprised right now that this is even moderately accurate. I thought for sure this was going to",

I'm actually kind of surprised right now that this is even moderately accurate. I thought for sure this was going to be completely wrong. Which is good. So then the next step is literally just conducting basic data analysis. We can use different time frames. And we can say how did Amazon. How did Amazon behave around these dates. And then we can populate either. I don't typically use charts just because I can kind of see it in the numbers. But what I typically would do now is actually just feed this into Python and then query it against it in there because I can do a lot with it much more quickly. Then writing it in Excel. But you can also do it in Excel. This is exactly exactly the process. But we can just eyeball it super fast. So let's. I need to expand this. And let's go. We'll clear everything. And then let's go to February seventh. We'll do day before day of day after. And then let's take a look at the other one which was 10 Jan. And then we can see the other day after. And then the other six days. Before day of day after. And let's take a look. Here's the Fed block. And we can take a look at the differences.",

This is when the actual data came out. So this is what I refer to as just an eyeball test, right? This is statistically completely insignificant. But it's a way for us just to even get a rough idea. What happens on specifically the day of. So if I take a look at Amazon's price behavior the day of on this day. And then we can take a look at whether or not it came in above or below. And then we can then figure out. What the corresponding move was. And again, you need a much larger data set than this. Like I would go back the last two years probably. So that I at least have something that's relevant. But I would wait the more recent stuff a little more heavily. Because it's definitely going to be a little bit more important. And just realized this after six. So you've always got to go as always. If you need anything, let me know. Be an outlier. I'll see you all later.",
