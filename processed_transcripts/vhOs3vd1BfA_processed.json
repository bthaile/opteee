    "text": "Trading the wheel for income. We just had a great conversation about that on a live stream. You should check them out We stream daily, but I want to walk you through an actual practical example of this and why there is some really important nuances You have to be aware of if you think you're going to trade the wheel for income, especially in some index spy Now one of the big issues people have with the wheel is it sounds so good It sounds like a win-win-win-win, right? You so cash secured puts you get assigned at a cheaper basis You collect premium to do it you sell calls collect premium against the shares that you hold and then you hold shares that appreciate and value It sounds great across the board and I am actually an advocate of a very close cousin to the wheel that I think is far superior Which is a covered strangle some slight nuances between them I'll throw a link in the notes below that walk through that strategy and why I really prefer it over the wheel But they're not that far apart Now the main thing is when we approach trading we have to approach it with our eyes wide open That means we can't focus just on the elements that sound good or the pieces that we like We have to walk through the reality of what it can look like In general the markets look good the exhibit",

This is just like a scratch tracker We don't really need the short put side because the wheel typically starts with cash secure puts until you're assigned And once we get assigned we'll just have our shares so i'm going to use the current price of sp 500 is 457 53 And this is starting the study on 10 Jan 2022 10 Jan 22 just for reference So let's now go through and take a look at what this whole thing ends up being I'm adding another cell down here which helps me track The performance as we move along and then as we compare it to current spot price This is using a perspective 100,000 dollar allocation So the first step in our process is to sell cash secure puts until we're assigned and we have 100,000 dollars to do so So let's go in here and Let's find we'll just start with like a 30 delta something really really simple We'll collect 714 because the market is already falling very very volatile And let's figure out how many of these we can sell there's 443 dollars is the strike price so that tells us if we sell two of them We're essentially going to be using 88 6 so that's pretty much What we're going to end up doing here. So right now it's 18 feb 22 The stock at entry as we've already identified 457 53 The expiration date is going to be 18 feb 22",

We're tying up 88 6 We're going to collect 1428 we're going to achieve a 1.6 return on invested capital for a pretty short term trade this Is wrong obviously like I said this should be 10 Jan 22 And then this column is going to be completely rune because it's using Today as compared to so not a bad return on invested capital for a 30 day trade if we annualize that that's really healthy So let's fast forward. I'm going to take a straight to expiration just so that we can move through this a little more efficiently So we need to go to 18 feb And let's see where we're at for these I normally use the chart because it populates faster",

That's the more important part Because if you take it all the way to expiration and allow it to expire that's fine, but then you Don't have the opportunity to lay them out again over the weekend, which is suboptimal So here's our trade from the call perspective. We'll take this down This will go into our little call section down here. This is nothing we can clear that out And let's take a look at the trade as it sits so the stock is currently trading at 439 So If we had bought outright at 457 we would be down 4.1 percent But our position is actually up just a little bit, which is really cool. That's one of the benefits of Trading something like the wheel where we can have satellite positions like these puts like these calls Make a little bit of money as we move along. So let's continue the experiment Today's date in the thing is 18 March 22 And then the stock at entry will be the same as the stock is exit for the last position And I'll move this out of the way. So again, I can go a little quicker And let's go out here to 14 April we'll do 14 April 22 Let's see if we can get another 30 delta that's above our basis. We can so this is 452 our basis is 443 So",

    "text": "we go out 28 days We go to that 432 You're now only making like 10 cents You're just not making one So this is one of the limitations of trading the wheel for income Income specifically Because if your approach is to trade this for income If we take a look at the overall duration That we're into this whole thing We started on 19 Jan 22 The date that we're at in here is 17 June We're about halfway through the year And our overall PNL is much better Than if we had just bought outright It's about half But you're still down 12 That's still not good That's not good enough And this is one of the reasons why I like the coverage Strangles so much more than this Is because we use calls inputs As satellite positions around the underlying itself And we get much better adjustments out of it But the main issue with this idea of trading Something like Spivey of the wheel for income Is that if you go through periods like this You have to have another approach Otherwise you just you don't really have income coming in Once we get into this right so like The last couple short calls that we traded We made 26 on those And we just Don't have a lot To show for the risk that we're putting out And I think what did we get on these up here Yeah the 26 bucks So Here's",
