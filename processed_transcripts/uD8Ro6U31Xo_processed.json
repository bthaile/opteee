    "text": "I made 28 return on my money in less than two months on this trade, but I could have made more. I want to walk you through the Apple ratio call diagonal. I brought up on some of the YouTube live sessions. And I want to share with you at the end of the video some different scenarios that could have played out if I placed the trade differently and talk about how I think about those because it's really important to keep things in context. What's up everybody? Eric here. Welcome back to all the outliers. Shout out to the Patreon family if my videos are useful to you consider signing up. It helps me out a bunch. Let's get right into the video. Okay, so here we have a trade in Apple. And essentially I entered here with some 190 days to expiration, deep in the money long calls. And I also sold some short premium against them. The reason why I like this trade is because it allows me to benefit from the leverage of options, but then also collect some premium upfront. So that's exactly what I'm doing. It's also known as a poor man's covered call, which is slightly different than what I'm doing here. It's a ratio diagonal. Now as I progress through the trade, I started noticing that there is definitely some bullish bias here. I was getting the movements that I wanted to see. And I needed to make some interesting adjustments",

Now as I progress through the trade, I started noticing that there is definitely some bullish bias here. I was getting the movements that I wanted to see. And I needed to make some interesting adjustments to my position. So here's what we got. Overall in Apple, I was bullish. That's why I chose a ratio call diagonal. And for those that, you know, don't really understand what I was seeing at the point in time, I'm going to zoom this in so that you can see exactly what it looked like when I entered, which is this right here. This is when I entered after a good earnings release after the earnings release, it was holding that gap up. And the other thing I found interesting is that this is near term highs, right, on the chart at the point in time. And this is counterintuitive to a lot of traders. Traders are typically like, they got to bargain by, they got to look in the bottom of the bins and find the cheap cigarette butts that are half smoldered and hope that it goes up. I'm partially making fun of Warren Buffett, but not really. He's a genius, but I'm too impatient. I'm not as good as he is. And my goal is to make money a little bit faster.

Let me zoom this back into a six-month daily. That's a three-month daily, great job, Eric, you missed. There we go. We're back at it. And let's take a look at the entry. So like I said, this was on the 10th of May. I bought the 17-nove 130 at a two-to-one ratio. That's why I have two here and ones down here for the short calls and most of them. So I'm just giving you an idea of the ratio. This is the minimum size I could show you a two-to-one ratio. And I had bought those for 47-45. They were around an 86 delta. When I first bought them, when I exited, they were like a 98 delta. And the way that I was thinking about managing risks to the downside was actually pretty simple.

I went from a two lot to a one lot because I was seeing that bullish confirmation. I wanted to let it move to the upside. And that's exactly why I wanted to reduce some of the short deltas against the longs. Give it some more room to run. And then the rest of the short calls that I was using in this instance, I kept it down at that two to one ratio. The reason why I had a one to one when I first entered is because the deltas were offset enough that I still had upside potential to run. Now, I did end up having a bunch of these that I close for losses throughout the cycle of the trade. And again, that's because I was favoring the upside potential as compared to salvaging the credit that I could collect on the trade. So you can look through this, see what you think. And the ultimate end state here is I exited. I didn't exit both leaps at the same time. I exited one of them to cover the cost of this in the money short call that I couldn't wiggle out of.

And the reason why I did that is because I had this position that was expiring 28 July. They were the 190s. And at this point, we're at like 196. So there was nowhere for me to go. It definitely there wasn't a great role available without going super far down time. That kind of thing. And I looked at it and said it made the move that I wanted. And it had already started to stall out after hitting this high volume was contracting down. If we look at it on average. And I also saw starting to hover into this nine day moving average short term moving average. So all of that led me to say like I actually thought there was going to be a little bit more upside potential after I got out. But I didn't think it was going to be too much. So that's exactly why I got out here. Sometimes when something makes the move that you want it to make, you don't have to fight it all of the way. Now one of the things somebody was asking me is how did I kind of decide when to take profits? Like why didn't I exit here or why didn't I exit here? The main reason is",

As long as the trend continues to move where I want it to move, what I like to do is continually slide up my stops. So what I mean by that is if I grab this price level and I show you my original stop was, you know, like I said somewhere right around here around 162. And that's when it was on the 10th of May. Then when I saw it rally up here into this like one high 170s, I slid my stop up to here to 170. Then as I saw it start to catch this leg, I look for the next set of near term resistance, which I considered something around here, maybe like 181. And I'm just using the tops from here and then the bottoms from here. And then I'm using the moving averages as my shorter term indicator as I'm sliding this thing up. I care about the slope and I care about the organization. So as long as it continues following the trend, then I'm going to try to stay in it.

If I didn't have the short calls expiring that forced my hand to close here, I would have held it until here. And I would have gotten out as price firmly closed below the nine and was touching the 22. That would have been exit protocols for me in that case. So just giving you some context there. Okay. Now as I promise, I want to walk you through these three scenarios. The first scenario is exactly what happened. This was buying the long options and selling options against it, which in this case worked against me. I gave up some money doing that. So in this case, I walked out again, 28.8 return on a Vesic capital. If I didn't trade any short options, knew the future and knew it was going to go up and just bought the same long options, I would have had something between a 35 38 return on a Vesic capital depending on you know, exact exit and entry. So I'm giving up anywhere from you know, six to 10 points on my return here. But this is predicated on me knowing the future that it's going to go up. I did, that's why I trade these.

And then if we look at buying the commensurate size in shares, it would have been a 13 return on a Vesic capital. That's another thing people ask all the time is, is it better to just buy the shares? It can be sometimes. But in this case, it's a little more nuanced because if I had bought again, using 10,000 account as the sample, if I had bought 10,000 worth of Apple when it was trading at 172, I would have had like 55 shares, something like that, 57 I think. And if that made its run from 172 up to 196, that's my return 13.1. But what you're seeing here is leverage. In this scenario, I would have controlled again like 57 shares. In this case, I was controlling 200 shares on the same exact cost structure. This is why sometimes if you use options for leverage, it can actually be a pretty beautiful thing. So if you have any questions on what I did, why I managed it the way I did, let me know. Throw down in the comments if you would make the same trade. And if so, what would you make the trade in?
