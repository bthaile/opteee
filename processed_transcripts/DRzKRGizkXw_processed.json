    "text": "I got a DM asking what happened to the implied volatility today in GameStop after the shareholder meeting and you know if it's about some options, I'm here for it. So exactly what we're going to talk about today because interestingly enough, that volatility didn't bleed out as much as I expected, which makes me believe there might be something else that the market is looking at, which we'll take a look at. While I was at it, a couple of the updates that I saw were in Kitty dropping his standard cryptic messages with no captions at all, you guys are really, really good at interpreting what these mean. I am not. I don't know all the details yet. I did look up both of these quickly and this dude was complaining about the repping at some tennis matches and then this guy apparently is from a Disney movie that he can see the future and people are really reading into this green reflection, although he looks super sad to me. So I don't know what to make of either of those. You guys will have to tell me. But let's talk about this real quick too. This is from Ryan Cohen after the shareholders meeting and it seemed interesting because on Twitter, it seemed like a lot of people were expecting this big rallying cry from Cohen. And to me, at least this is a very standard shareholder's meeting update where they're just talking about broad brush strokes.",

And to me, at least this is a very standard shareholder's meeting update where they're just talking about broad brush strokes. They're not getting super far into detail. This is kind of standard fair. It seems like you guys were expecting something else at least to some degree. Again, I don't know the history. I don't know if he promised a specific roadmap with specific action items and things like that. If so, that would be a big miss. But I didn't see anything like that. This looks like standard fair. I just bring that up for context because I don't like seeing newer traders kind of getting their expectations super accelerated compared to where we may or may not be and then disappointed on the back end. It just doesn't really help anything. At least from the trader's perspective, which is what I care about the most. I care about you guys and your ability to trade effectively. All right. Let's get into now actually what I do know about, which is this some options. So if we take a look at GameStop, this is today, the 17th of June. This was yesterday, the 16th of the June over the weekend. And there was a big drop in implied volatility yesterday. It was hovering 280, cracked over 280 for a",

And there was a big drop in implied volatility yesterday. It was hovering 280, cracked over 280 for a little bit. And then today, after the meeting, after the close, this is now down to 204. So 76 points. It's a big drop, especially over the course of a day. As big as I thought in terms of the anticipation around this event, the fact that this is still over 200 with now four days left to go is actually quite interesting to me. So if we take a look at the market right now, it's 204 51. And right now, I would have expected this to be down quite a bit more. I also noticed that the expiration for next cycle, 28th of June is also still pretty elevated. 180 compared to everything else, which is in the 160s, 150s. That's a big difference. So to a degree, the market is still pricing in a larger price band. Now, another question I got from somebody is, is I've all good or bad? It's not inherently either. The reason for that is this is agnostic. This isn't saying it's going to go up a lot or down a lot. It's saying it could do either and we don't really know. So this is kind of projecting a cone of",

It's saying it could do either and we don't really know. So this is kind of projecting a cone of price movement. So that's why this says plus or minus. And actually, this number doesn't look correct to me. I think it's slightly higher than that now. But specifically the 4.36, I think it's higher than that. We can do the math on it in a second. But this essentially means that the market is expecting a fairly large move in a relatively short period for a relatively cheap product, right? It's 25 bucks. So to see these kinds of moves over the course of four days, that's still pretty significant volatility. Now from a chart perspective, which I think in this case doesn't really apply that much to game stop really because of the way that it operates. But it does look like it's kind of holding this 24 and a half handle pretty well. That's the main thing I see at least from a support perspective. But again, I really would be very hesitant to apply my typical technical analysis approach to something like game stop. It clearly breaks the rules all the time. It's a completely different product. That's what makes it kind of the special thing that it is. A couple of the things that though",

If you remember yesterday, when we were looking at this exact thing down at the bottom, I'll slide out of the way so you can see. This has changed massively. So yesterday, we saw the put side of this front expiration, the IV severely depressed. That typically leads to a upward price sensitivity, meaning we're pricing in more vols to the upside. This is now turned into almost a standard volatility smile. Slight calls skew still in terms of the vols, but not massive. This is way more normal. So if you compare this to the video I did yesterday, you'll see a huge difference between these. And this is exactly how vol adjusts based on current market conditions. Now, if you look at the following expiration, 28 June, we see something different again. We see that same kind of call skew that we saw yesterday. So this is again, the market very clearly pricing in more vols to the upside, pricing in more upside. So you can't take away too much from that right out of the jump, but that just tells me how they're pricing",

So you can't take away too much from that right out of the jump, but that just tells me how they're pricing options via the volatility. Now, if we take a look at the overall volumes for today, very interesting day. And it's because if you look at the calls versus puts, a lot of calls traded compared to the puts that typically means, oh, wow, people are expecting upside. That's what you would assume if they're buying calls. I don't actually think that's the most of what's going on here. And I'll tell you why. If you take a look at the traded at the bid or below, traded at the ask or above, if you're buying things and you're trying to get your trade on, it's going to be at or above the offer, the ask. This is if you're buying options in this scenario. And if you're selling options and you're trying to get your sold options out there and on, it would be at the bid or below. So what I see here and then just to kind of finish this part out between the market is if you're playing the midpoint.

So this for kind of this purpose, you typically would just get rid of this line because you can't tell anything from it essentially. Now, what I can see is from the calls that traded today, 36 of them were done at the bid or below. That tells me those are likely sales, meaning people selling calls, meaning we are expecting the market to go down or want the market to go down. This can be done against covered calls scenario where you have the shares and sell calls against your shares. That is one of my guesses on what could be going on here. Now, the other thing I see is on the put side, it's the inverse. So if you're buying puts, you would want the market to go down. And if you're buying them and you want to get your puts on, it would be at the offer, the ask or above, 39 of them took place there as compared to 26 at the bid.

So this tells me there's a smaller subset of people who are selling puts, which is bullish and more people that are buying puts, which is bearish wanting something to go down. Again, this could be buying protective puts against long shares. You don't know. But what I do know is from a pure speculative standpoint, there's more downside transactions occurring between the calls and the puts here. Now, the last thing I want to look at real quick is the expiration this week and next week because there's massive volume. So again, quick recap, open interest are contracts that are open and outstanding. And volume are just the number of trades on that contract today. We can't tell if these are opening trades or closing trades, but we can make some inferences. So for example, on these 26 calls, there is 5400 OI, 20,000 volume today, even if we close all of these OI out, that still means 15,000 of these were buys. So there's a lot of people buying out of the money calls that essentially expire in a few days, same thing at this 30 handle. There's no doubt buying volume here because again, if you sell all of these against the existing OI, which is 67,000, there's still a net positive figure here. That means that there's still additional buys happening. And again, it looks",

That means that there's still additional buys happening. And again, it looks like it's more than that. So the market still is looking at some upside here. It's hard to tell exactly to what degree, though. We really don't know. Now, the other thing that you can read in between the lines ever so slightly is if you look at the closing price, 25, 22. And if you look at kind of the first out of the money put, which is 25, and then the first out of the money call, which is 2550, which one of those is closer, are we closer to 25 or 255? We're technically closer to 25. Yet it has a lower delta. That's informative. That means that the market is at the very least pricing in a slight favorable up move to the 255, which is again, slightly further away than these puts. And that to me is slight buying pressure, at least in terms of the way that these are being priced. Options are fascinating. There's all these little things you can take a look at to kind of make inferences, but it's really important. You can't look at any one of them and think, okay, this is what's going to happen.

You can't look at any one of them and think, okay, this is what's going to happen. The vast majority of the time you kind of have to piece it all together and see what you see. And in this case, it's really mixed back. It looks like the vast majority of options volume that we're seeing today is sell pressure. It looks like from an implied volatility perspective, we're approximating to more of a smile for the close expiration, meaning this very front expiration and then the very next expiration, which is next Friday. It has that more kind of call skew focus that we've seen previously for this expiration. Now, let's take a look at the 28 June super fast, see if anything sticks out. And it still looks like some pretty big call OI. This is across a lot of these different delta's, which is interesting because if we look at the overall call transactions on this side, compared to this side, it's still pretty massive. So one of the other things we can do real quick out of curiosity is we can take a look at the volume for today. We can look at this kind of near term series. Let's take a look at calls and puts. And so this is just looking at the",

Let's take a look at calls and puts. And so this is just looking at the front two expirations and a lot of this volume for both of them, actually the majority of the volume that we're seeing across all contracts were in these front two, which again is interesting to me. And there is a lot of volume here at the 30s, which I think we saw which was this block here. So not dead, meaning there's still a lot of people playing in these really short term expirations, which is very interesting to me. If you're interested from a retail trade and perspective, why that can be really, really dangerous, check out the last video I did. I'll throw it in the notes below because I think that's super important for new traders to be aware of that buying far out of the money options seems really attractive, but it's not as attractive as you might think it is. And you should just be aware whether you still want to trade them or not. That's obviously totally up to you. You seemingly are grown people as you should be slaying in trades however you feel like it, but it should be at least informed. We should know the trade off. So that's the goal",
