And I'm really hung up on that at the moment. So anybody that could send help, that would be great. Corey says seven. So seven we call evening. Okay. So it's afternoon. So happy on this beautiful afternoon. We have, let's say hello to everybody. So we got roaring titty, the crowd favorite. Great to see you. We're going titty. We got Corey Jimmy, Oli and we have that Lauren, Paulo. Great to see everybody. Oli pop and says afternoon is still correct. Yeah, I feel like, I don't know, five, six starts to feel like evening to me, but I don't know what the actual cutoff is. This is one of those things where I feel like I have an idea of how it goes. And then clearly I have no idea how it goes. So I'm going to do the logical thing. I'm going to ask chat GPT. What time is considered afternoon and then evening. Let's see. Then we got Jonathan from North Carolina. I have a buddy out there. I actually think he just recently moved, but it was a in Ashburn. I think it was called from not mistaken. That's in North Carolina in it. Vladimir says sunset. I think sunsets legit. Okay. So chat GPT",

In lasts until around five or six p.m. The exact transition can vary slightly based on regional customs or personal preferences. But afternoon generally refers to the period when the sun is still high in the sky after lunchtime. Yeah. Okay. Evening starts around five or six and lasts until nine or just after sunset evening marks the transition period from day to night when activities are winding down. Sun begins to set. Well, little little did I know little did you know that if you work in the military when it's dark out, that's actually when activities typically just start. So by that definition evening never happens because that talks about activities winding down. That's just when the fun begins because most of the people that we currently will we used to decide to fight don't have fucking night vision. So it makes those kinds of interactions pretty one sided TBH. But okay. So let us let's start with the market. That's what I wanted to start with.

It's just making guesses at shit. But the thing that I do want to talk about are just the data pieces that came out because those actually like genuinely do matter to us. So let's grab our friends over at Benzinga. I'm going to change this setup here just a little bit because I don't really care about the period. I care about the actual I care about the consensus and I care about prior. That's what I care about the rest of that stuff is all just not okay. So we had PPI and PPI came in. Is that right? Did PPI come in flat month over month? Is that correct? I have to double check that. I haven't looked yet. But PPI flat. That's interesting. If that is the case, let's see.

And I'm sure that that is very close to manifesting. When I talk about manifesting, I talk about the near term version of that or I guess like the more colloquial version.

Yeah, I love that. Mr. Off Putin. I think that's spot on. But yeah, okay. So this has been pretty, pretty flat for a little while now. And let's take a look actually from BLS. So goods is contracted and services expanded slightly. Interesting. So PPI for final demand unchanged in September services rise. 0.02 goods 0.02. Let's see. And next for final demand rose 1.8. So this I'm not going to lie, this is a little interesting to me like this came in slightly different than expected. I had expected slight contraction, but I didn't expect it to be quite like this. So most of September decrease in prices for unprocessed goods for intermediate demand can be traced back to crude petroleum, which fell 16.7. So that's that's interesting because production is still pretty high there. Prices for ungraded chicken eggs.

Oh, it looks like two people. Not going to lie. Seems sus because both of these comments came in at like the same time. But let me show you this. It's kind of funny. So for those that liked the the podcast that I did both with PB and Lauer, let me show you in alternative view, which is our friend. Solon tro team who is letting me know that I'm a shale, which I'm very, very thankful for. And then active rehab mobility, which I have to be honest, I'm a little upset at this one because right now I am literally trying to actively rehab my mobility.

And it sucks that the person that it seems like they could help me with that. They're also, um, calling me out, well, asking if I'm sure. Which obviously I would just answer them, right? Because they should know it's only fair for me to come clean since they peg me down. I think what I need to do is actually define shale. Because I think that this is probably one of the most crazy misuse terms now. Yeah, that's what I thought. Shale. The shale is someone who promotes or endorses a product service or cause in a deceptive or dishonest manner. Interesting. Okay. Well, we just have to let rehab mobility and chill on tro team. The other thing that I can't help but find kind of interesting is this. It looks like they, here's my guess genuinely. And this is the funny thing about people. I, these comments came in at like the same time. So my guess is this one came in same time as this one. I think this is the same person. And I literally think this person wanted to respond to this person, but forgot to switch their fucking account. That's my guess. I have nothing to validate any of that. But I just think it's hilarious. I literally think it's hilarious if that is",

But yeah, that's a fucking word now. Wrong to, he says, graded or probably processed and ready for sale, unprocessed. Probably have been collected but not checked for suitability for sale yet. Interesting. So graded is the idea. So grading is just applied to whether or not it's processed. Right. So are you guessing or are you telling me because I don't know. That sounds legit. But but if you tell me that, I would believe you, if you're guessing, we can check it because I don't know the difference. What's the difference between graded and ungraded chicken eggs?

One of the coolest things that you'll find as a trader or investor in the markets is that it is one of the most interesting lenses to learn about the world. And you will learn about so fucking much. It'll make your head spin. Okay. So graded eggs are they go through a quality inspection process where they assessed for external and internal factors. Shells quality, yolk, and albuming condition. So there's grade AA grade A grade B. And ungraded eggs have no official inspection. They're not inspected or rated according to quality. This happens with farm, fresh, or backyard eggs sold at local markets or directly from farms. So I think the main thing is you actually like farm fresh eggs then would still be sold. But they're just they don't go through an inspection process. So rowing titty to your to your point that would lead me to believe that if you're getting your farm fresh eggs, there's a chance you might get a little more protein in it. There's a little baby chicken in there might have a crunch. You know what I mean? That's what it looks like. Interesting. And there's those three grades. AA and",

All Putin says why do they refrigerate eggs in the US but almost nowhere else in the world? That's due to the washing process. So there's a this is actually funny that I know this. There's a outer part of the egg called a cuticle like the cuticle of your nail. And that washing process strips the cuticle away. So when that cuticle is stripped away, then the egg is more prone to decaying salmonella bacterial and stuff like that. So off Putin, that's why we refrigerate eggs in the US is because ours are inspected washed a certain way. And once you go through that washing, it strips away the cuticle. I don't know.

So this is something from I actually don't remember when I drew this. But if we go back far enough, we can see when I first started drawing this channel, but a massive breakout from this channel. Now the reason why this is interesting to me is because this is one of the most quintessential breakout patterns that you can absolutely trade. I traded just the move today. I used futures. It was an intraday trade. I still have about two thirds of the position on. But this is something that I talked about not too long ago yesterday. I talked about another trade that exhibit similar similar tendencies to this kind of style of setup. But this is a standard breakout play. So the profit mechanism as I look at something like this is velocity. It's something that starts to get really, really constrained in price. And then sooner or later, it makes a big decision.

Because if you go into the heat map, you go within the rustle. Take a look at where you see super bright green. You can see this happen right on the day. The other thing that we should take a look at for something like this is where you see red. The reason why it matters to look for red on days like today is because it's giving you views on stocks that are clearly bucking the broader trend. So by looking at a heat map like this, we get to do two things. The first thing we get to do is find leaders that are driving price performance. The second thing you get to do is find weak stocks that are slowing or moving against the broader trend despite the amount of support that there is for the movement. Because the other thing I want you to notice is take a look at the individual sectors. Do you notice anything interesting about the sectors in general? Any guesses?

Do you notice anything interesting about the sectors in general? Any guesses? I want you to specifically focus on what the relationship looks like in terms of the number of red that you see within the different sectors. Then I'm updating the time stamps for whoever else ends up watching this in the future so that they can skip past all the random bullshitting in the beginning. There we go. Corey says crypto huge exactly. Rointitys says one sector has no red exactly. That's exactly correct. Joey says small amounts of red in each sector. That's also correct. So one thing to note is that financials that's this whole sector. So there's definitely red in financials just to be clear. These are just different kinds of reats and stuff like that. But the main points is if we look at the performance of the sectors, this is literally the process of being a trader is coming up with these broader themes that stick out to us from a macro broader perspective, not macroeconomic macro market perspective and use it to define ideas. So one of the things you hide up you highlighted is financials. Financials look super strong today. Where's the weakness in financials? In real estate, ABR, REIT, PMT, REIT, too, very much real estate, heavy, MFA, REIT, RC, REIT, you get the point. REITs",

In real estate, ABR, REIT, PMT, REIT, too, very much real estate, heavy, MFA, REIT, RC, REIT, you get the point. REITs are not doing great. So when we look at financials in general, they're doing quite well. If we take a look at something like information technology, you can see that there's a little bit more of a mixed bag here. We can see that there's some strong performers, but there's also kind of a mix of not super strong performers and then some slightly negative performers. Learning to look with a purpose is so important for your evolution as a trader. When we look at stuff like this, we should not open up a heat map and think, oh, I want to see if I can find blank, blank being whatever your preconceived notion might be. What our objective is when we do this is to find tradable information. Some of that tradable information is going to be indirect, meaning I might look at financials and decide, okay, I'm going to trade financials. That's direct. Or I might look at financials and just mentally note financials are strong. Maybe I'll scan and set up some alerts for financials, but maybe not place a trade right now. That's indirect.

Both of those are completely useful data points for you to house in your brain and specifically your subconscious. So the other thing, again, when you're looking at heat maps, we want to look at breath, meaning across the board, what does the tenor look like? And again, when we look at small caps, most of it's up. How many of them are very bright green, meaning larger up moves? A good bit of them. If I were to eyeball this, I would guess maybe 15 something like that, 20 if that. How many of them are green compared to red? It looks like a decent majority, probably 70, 75. So by just eyeballing this, I'm not taking the time to download all the information, to run it through Python and see the individual details, although we can, and there's different ways to look at that. I'm just eyeballing. The other thing that I'll do, as I already mentioned, is I will look at what is showing really great moves. And I want to see why. Is it something that's pertaining to the entire sector? Or is it something pertaining to the individual stock? So for example, IT, MSTR, obviously, it's 16 today. This is very not representative of most of this",

So then we have to begs the question, what's going on with MSTR? And we already know MSTR is full of idioms and critic risk. So it's kind of like looking at a specific piece of the overall tech sector from the small cap side of things. This, in my opinion, is not indicative of all small caps. And it's showing me that the IT sector right now is being moved within small caps by something like this. That's the idea. So this is the way that we can use heat maps to come up with ideas. All right, let me catch up on the chat. James says, M2K futures or something else. I didn't use the minis because I wasn't building a position over time. So I used RTY. We're referring to the to the Russell scalp today. And it's not a scalp to be clear, intraday trade. I use scalp in the common parlance just because people will more accurately identify what I mean by that. So yeah, I just use Russell futures. We got Joey. Good to see you, Joey. Paul says, what",

Oh, rock. That's a fun one. So let's take a look at these. So we want to look at NVEE, data split. We have rock, gap down, EBF, massive gap down. Looks like dividend. CMRE, slowly rotating down, GNK, same, SB, same. So the thing for me when I look at this structure within industrials is it's not exactly where I necessarily want to fade. So like this starts to look a little more interesting to me. When I'm looking for sectors that I want to fade within, I'm going to look for stuff that looks sad. Consumer discretionary looks kind of sad. Energy still looks a little bit sad. Com services looks a little bit sad. Let's take a look in consumer discretionary. There's not a bunch of stuff that's making like crazy big down moves, but there's also not a bunch of stuff making really big up moves. So we can look for stuff that's making bigger moves like W, W.

It's how I find stuff that looks interesting before it's actually doing the interesting thing so that then I can try to get into it when it's doing the interesting thing because otherwise that's one of the big issues that I see with people is that there's a pretty significant gap in entry timing. And I think that it's kind of a actually a pretty profound problem if I think of it from a slightly larger perspective. So that's the idea behind this is to find things that are moving in a way that I can trade them but before they make a move so I can set alerts so that then I can catch them. For those that were on the live stream yesterday, I posted about this in the discord following up with you all. Gold. Gold last night while we were on that live stream kicked off an alert and I literally stopped in the middle of the live stream to put on my position in gold. And it's because I have an alert that's sitting that then I can identify a move. All right. Paul says bearish. Zack says down trend higher highs and lows. Yep. So it's definitely breaking down. I said, I would",

That's not to say it's stupid in the fact that like it couldn't get a bounce. It can get a bounce. But it's stupid in the fact that that's applying a really, really, really broken down expectation of price performance. And that comes from the bargain buying side of a standard traders brain. A normal trader will think of things as being at extremes and then play contrarian because we think it's gone too far. Stuff like that, which yeah, typically isn't super favorable.

Okay, Zach says, stupid question, how are you able to put on a position in gold after hours? I only trade gold ETFs. Yeah, they still trade. So different futures markets will have different trading hours. You can check with your broker. So like, for example, let me look at Schwab futures trading hours. During the week, they close down for just a brief bit after the after the market closes and then they open right back up. So oh, here you go. Equity futures goes Sunday to Friday from 1800 to 1700. So there's a one-hour break between 1700 and 1800 Eastern time. For commodities like crude oil, gold, they go Sunday to Friday. Overnight trading starts at 1800 on Sunday and continues until 1700 on Friday. With the one-hour break from 1700 to 1800 each day. And then treasury bonds, this is for Schwab. Same schedule essentially. So that's one of the benefits of trading futures. And that's actually another thing that I think a lot of traders don't fully pay attention to. And the reason for that is because if let's say you have a portfolio on and it's one of the reasons why I'm",

And the reason for that is because if let's say you have a portfolio on and it's one of the reasons why I'm more comfortable using leverage is because I can always track my beta-weighted portfolios and make adjustments. So let's take a look at Eric's special. Well, you already know the next question. It's probably the biggest question that we're going to cross together here. You guys already know. Oh, shit, Rowan Titty. Yeah, great call. So I like this for a breakdown trade. So when I look at the overall trend here on a six-month chart, well, go out to a year first. On a year we had a high below lower high, right? Like this really choppy choppy movement. If I zoom in to a shorter term time frame, we can see that it peaked up here, gap down on earnings that wasn't well received. It came in at negative five cents. It was estimated at negative seven seven zero point seven or I'm sorry point zero seven seven rally down, hit a low, rallyed up lower high, rally down, lower low. So now I like this just for a breakdown continuation. That's all. And we can see that volatility in here is massive, right? So if we look at a five-day average ATRs 3.56, 20 days 4.74 and then",

Fundamentals for me for the time frame, fundamentals for me matter if I'm trading something that's going to be like a year plus, which is about nothing. So for me, fundamentals are generally just for context. It's again, just because I'm genuinely interested. So when I look at the earnings and I go through the earnings report, it's not to build up some sort of big bear thesis thinking I'm going to find something in the earnings report that other people didn't see and they're not pricing in because it doesn't matter, right? When I look at the way markets move in different time frames, if you have a company that's showing solid, fundamental performance and it's continuing to grow, meaning fundamentals are growing, that means that the company is growing.

That's what it boils down to. The fundamentals as it sits today are baked into the price. And the thing that's more important for this is when we have movement, that's what I'm trading. The reason for the movement is not predicated on the fundamentals, quite literally at all. So for example, some of the movement that we can see in footlocker over the last two through two, three weeks, literally, I don't know what's causing it. Obviously, it's going down. So it tells me people are selling it. Why they're selling it? It doesn't ultimately matter to me. Other than I'm just curious about it, and it does provide a little bit of context for the move.

If it's going down because they got sued because their CEO did some shit that he's not supposed to. I'm not saying that that happened. I don't think it did. But that's why it's going down. So from a trading perspective, we, the fundamentals largely are going to be priced in. That's what typically has us about where we're at. And then the broader market is going to respond to fundamentals differently depending on their position durations because think of the average hedge fund or mutual fund or pension fund. They're not going to float in and out of the stuff like I would as a trader, the vast majority, the vast majority of money moves very, very slow.

Litany of factors. So if we're building an investment thesis, that's completely different because in an investment thesis, we're thinking shorter term positioning has to sort itself out.

So my hands are starting to slow down already. So if we look at Nvidia, and we'd look at like this period here, right? Not a huge down move, but not insignificant. And then it's kind of been trending sideways. It hasn't hit new highs quite yet. But I mean, like, look at the movement. It's absolutely beautiful. It's slightly broken down, but it's still overall good where we had a high. We had a pullback correction essentially posted a low, ran up to a high, posted a higher low, trended sideways posted a slightly lower high. That's not a great look, but that happens sometimes. Trends down a little bit, catches on the MA starts to rally up and out. And now it's moving closer to all time highs. All of that is movement from a trading perspective that doesn't really matter for an investor. Because if you look at this from an investment perspective, the answer is just buy.

    "text": "up and out. And now it's moving closer to all time highs. All of that is movement from a trading perspective that doesn't really matter for an investor. Because if you look at this from an investment perspective, the answer is just buy. You buy whenever you feel like it and you hold on to it, because as long as it continues to grow as it should, that's ultimately what matters. So the biggest lesson from this entire section of the video is that you have to define what kind of investment thesis you're applying and what's the corresponding time frame. Because if I'm going to trade on something that I'm using a three year daily chart, fundamentals matter, guaranteed. If I'm trading something where I'm looking at a three month chart, fundamentals do not matter. There's nothing about fundamentals that matter to me in this time frame. So creating alignment between those is exceedingly important, I think. All right. Reese says I've spent so much time grasping options. It seems like another world, but there are essentially options, contracts, right? Futures. No. Futures are different. So futures are another type of derivative. There's a bunch of different. If you think of securities, I actually have a slide for this. In Erick's, you already know what it is. Erick's handy-dandy abomination of a slide deck. Oh yeah, this is an upcoming video I'm going to do. But what am I looking for? Markets, something like this is somewhere in here?",

Oh yeah, this is an upcoming video I'm going to do. But what am I looking for? Markets, something like this is somewhere in here? Where's it at? There you go. There you go. Securities. So you can see within the basket of securities in the market, there are kind of a couple big buckets. There's actually a few more than this. But inside of derivatives, there are options, futures, swaps, convertibles. There's Bermudian, Bermudian options. There's a lot of different kinds of derivatives that live in here. So futures are a different kind of derivative than options. They're very different. And there's actually options on futures. So there's a derivative on a derivative as well. Royntady says farmers use futures to sell their products. They actually don't. Yeah, they typically don't. Farmers, the advent of futures was actually to essentially add stability to commodities prices. So essentially, a futures contract is similar to option in that there's a contract between two parties. And it pertains to a specific asset for a time in the future. And the general purpose is if I'm a farmer and I'm trying to sell corn and then there's a grocery store that's going to use the corn, we can both add stability to our lives.

So it's to stabilize price. Now the way that farmers and agriculture will use them now is literally to primarily hedge their selling of the products. So you can see this expressed in this. Let me move this over here. Get rid of this here. So you can go to the commitment of traders report and you can look at something like wheat. And you'll notice something based on this. So you can look at the relationship between producers and speculators. So producers are going to be these red lines. And you notice how speculators are kind of the inverse. And then you'll notice that non commercials are kind of like this fucking middle of the middle of the road group. So what's happening here is commercials when they're buying stuff up like this that doesn't mean that they think that their underlying contract is going to appreciate in value and that they're going to sell the contract for a profit.

So this is a big thing if you look at something like airlines, they will use futures and trading activities to hedge the cost of fuel, which is highly variable. It creates a bubble for them and a general planning factor if they hedge their risk with respect to price changes. So futures are a little bit different in that sense in terms of like what their construction is. But the way to think about futures, they're kind of like a delta one variant of options for the base contracts. So you can use futures to trade things that you can't trade with options directly. So for example, that gold trade that I talked about yesterday, you can't trade gold outright with other securities. You can't trade the commodity itself. That's literally what futures were for is to trade the commodities themselves. So for something like that gold trade, it pertains to a certain amount of gold, physical gold.

And that's a common misconception about futures is that people think that futures are this insanely, you know, jack to the tits leveraged product. And some of them are big. Some of them are not big. So yeah, yes and no is the answer. Some things can move a lot. Some things cannot move a lot. And there's a difference between the amount of leverage something provides and also its volatility because you have to keep in mind, you can have something that might perceivably pertain to a lower dollar amount, but have a much more leverage tied to it. So this is a common thing that you'll find with net gas. Net gas is always touted as like the widow maker. It's like this big terrible thing. Net gas is not that bad. It really is not that bad.

So people misposition notoriously in something like net gas. But if we look at the volatility of something like net gas compared to other stuff, it's really not that crazy. But people are mispositioned and they trade really poorly around it. Because there's a reality here. We can see net gas hit a low of 144 back in 2020. And it literally hit 10 in 2022. That is a massive move on a relative basis for a commodity. That's a giant move. So one of the issues I think is people just misposition pretty pretty frequently, even big firms because they don't always fully respect hail risk is what it boils down to.

Because the problem with futures is that there are a lot of other elements that people don't really understand. Like, for example, carry. There's an optimal time to roll a futures contract depending on what it is based on the carry, which is a cost that you pay to hold it, but it's an indirect cost. So I think Roryntiti says, where can you pay for paper trade futures without paying a subscription? fucking Excel dog. Open up a Google sheet. There's and just track your own shit. There's zero reason to paper trade in a paper trading platform. Literally zero reason. Paper trading in a paper trading platform is it's literally pure silliness because you're not going to get real fills. And the data is gone. As soon as you hit reset, it's gone. Just open up Excel and paper trade in there. That's literally exactly what I do. I'm starting to move some of my stuff over to Google sheets. So it's a little more portable.

And I want to be at 310 now. This is from 21 September. So that video is about flying off the shelf as fast as you can. If there was a video to watch, I would I would watch that one before YouTube decides that it's too hot. And YouTube might pull it down because of how many views it's gotten. It could be too big of a video. So yeah, I think futures are completely, completely fine to to tinker with in Excel. But I like, I wouldn't jump into them. There's no reason to jump into them. There's slight benefits to them. But I would you got to focus. If you're trying to learn about trading options, going into futures, it's not the right place to go. It's genuinely not.

That's not difficult to learn. It's entirely easy to learn. But it's added complexity that just slows down the broader learning process. So yeah, that's that's exactly why I think futures are fine. And if you feel like you have a good understanding of options and you kind of get the world of derivatives, then there's no problem with starting to venture into into some future stuff. But futures have really important production cycles that you have to be aware of so that you don't get on the wrong side of essentially the futures version of binary events. And shit like that, it can it just catches people off, I think. So I would try to avoid those instances. James says, great thing on futures is if you're account as small, there's no PDT. Genuinely didn't know that. That's actually great for me to know. Yeah, I think, yeah, that's fascinating. I think traders trying to get around the PDT rule is always silly.

Zack says there's got to be a way to have AI fill it in for excel. Yeah, there's something like that. But again, if you watch that video, one thing I talk about is developing a relationship with the data. And I genuinely believe that's an important process. The reason is because if you understand if you're closer in the process of conducting data entry, you're inherently going to be closer to the information. It's just a function of doing it.

This guy is looking the wrong way, though. Kind of sucks to be him. So now what's happening is Lauren's over here with her telescope. And she sees this thing unfolding. She's like, oh, shit. Over there in the Middle East, this tank is shooting at this tank and they're driving towards each other. I think the market is probably not going to react well to this. And while the two tanks are going at it, you can see that this person over here is Israeli. And in their chat bubble, they're all like, hey, yo, fuck you. And then over here, we have this person that's like, yo, fuck you. So we can see that we have a clear issue starting to unravel. And Lauren, over here, she can see all this. And she's all like, hot damn. Let me check the port. Obviously, the port is the portfolio. So she doesn't want to take her eye off the microscope or the the monocle. And over here, she's going to whip out her cell phone. She's going to touch some buttons. And she's going to look at her portfolio that looks like this. So because she has chameleon eyes, she is this one looking this way, this one looking this way.",

He's the one that introduced me to trading. And then the second person is a guy that I met online. And I would indirectly learn from a lot of what he talked about. He was somebody that clearly didn't have a lot of motives. And the reason why I say that is because he was not nice to people. He's not like, I would consider myself much nicer than him, although I'm very direct and sometimes people interpret that as being not nice or or something like that, especially via messaging.

He's not like, I would consider myself much nicer than him, although I'm very direct and sometimes people interpret that as being not nice or or something like that, especially via messaging. Because messaging definitely comes across very tourists typically. But that mentor taught me that I didn't know shit about trading, even though I had been trading for a while. And I didn't go into it thinking that I was hot shit knowing everything. But just in the conversations I would have and watch him have, I learned that there was a lot of massive gaps in what I do. And that second mentor is a big reason why I started the YouTube channel. Because YouTube was around then, but it wasn't as big of a deal then. And he wasn't doing a YouTube. He had no interest in doing a YouTube channel. I actually invited him onto mine so that I could talk to him and kind of show the impact that he's had on my life. And hopefully just put that in front of people. But he didn't want to be he doesn't even I don't even mention his name because he doesn't want to be named.

Now his teaching style is actually very, very similar to my teaching style, which is I, I try to aim people in the right direction. But it's self learning. You should learn a lot of the nuance in the details by yourself. I obviously teach a lot of the fundamentals and foundational stuff, right? Like this whole spin-off series is essentially that to a T and going through in very, very deep detail teaching a lot of concepts. So it's not like I just say go learn this. It's definitely nothing like that. But it's also not overly prescriptive where I do not to heavily define the things that should be learned when I try to teach people to be autonomous. It's a very military style of training, especially for officers because you have to be a self-sufficient thinking being. So he very much taught me that.

You can just use options to gain leverage. That's it. Right? So if we go back, to the again, abomination of a slide deck, and we look at the big four strategy and trade process, it's quite simple. But let's say that you're a stock trader and you're able to find things that move directionally. Okay, well, that's your profit mechanism. You're able to accurately identify directional movements. However, you do that in stock trading is the same as what you would do in options trading. So then you essentially just need to find things that allow you to capitalize on that profit mechanism. But that's again, there's not an inherent edge to options. Options provide exposure to different kinds of phenomenon that can offer edge, like variance risk premiums. You can't get that with equities. So that exists. But options in and of themselves provide precisely zero edge. It's the same thing as people who debate buying or selling options.

But those are definitely quantifiable edges. People have like this really miss, I find like a wide array of edge, where some people that are too much efficient market hypothesis, they would argue that there is no edge, which obviously we know that there is. And I mean, you shouldn't use anecdotes, but I for a personal scenario, no for a factor's fucking edge. So that's from a theoretical perspective. If you take strong form of efficient market hypothesis, which we know is not so much the case. Be William says, I think a big thing when it comes to options is do your research on how the market makers choose price point and what the mechanics are about beneath the surface. Once you know how it works, you can make it. I would, I would actually argue differently than that be Williams, because realistically, like the way that market makers determine price or the way market determines price ultimately doesn't actually matter that much, right? It's consensus driven. So you can understand market mechanics intimately well and still not be able to make money from it. So for me, I think the North Star for edge, it's literally this process is outlined. Like this is the process to build edge is right here. And the reason for this",

And the reason for this is because again, a lot of people will start trading options thinking that there's some sort of magic solution in options to their trading problems and that they're going to be able to just trade options and make a bunch of money and it's just not the case. The way that you build edge in trading is by finding ways to make money. It's literally that simple. So then how do we find ways to make money? Well, that's the idea behind profit mechanisms. That's why I label it as such because they are things that lead to making money. So yeah, the understanding markets, market structure, the different players, all of that stuff is good information. But if a trader is really good at trading directionally, they could literally not know any of that and make money. So for example, if I'm really good at trading directionally, I can just buy option, buy calls in the money out of the money, both whatever, and I can still make more money than if I just bought the stock. That's with knowing nothing. It's literally just buying the options. Now, obviously you can optimize those returns by understanding what day's expiration",

What matters is if you have a quantifiable profit mechanism that you can take advantage of, that's what matters. And then your ability to detect it and then your ability to trade it.

He studied the stars intricately and predicted that there would be a massive olive harvest in his region. He had identified the olive presses that would witness huge demand and profit from his market vision. However, fails lacked funds required to buy all the olive presses. So in the offseason, he paid a some of money to each of the press owners to obtain the rights to use them at harvest time. He agreed to pay a small premium to the owners of the olive presses, which the owners would keep to lock in the right to use the presses for the next harvest at a predetermined price that literally is a premium to an option. The owners agreed to this as they would get a guaranteed amount, even if fails opted out of the deal, they would still be able to sell the rights to use the press every year. When the growing season set in, olive presses saw a harvest much higher than usual.

So fails for a military shows us actually that the very first options trade technically speaking is not a hedge at all, but he was speculating that demand was going to be massive in the coming harvest and he ended up being correct. Now again, in general, a lot of the more common use of early options definitely is very similar to hedging. That's a big part of it, but that's also that's more so futures why futures were invented was specifically for hedging. But yeah, anyways, in case anybody was interested in a history lesson, I literally go through essentially all of the early uses of options.

The funny thing about this story is if you go on the discord was for anybody here yesterday was anybody here on the live stream yesterday. And then I have another question for you.

    "text": "anybody here on the live stream yesterday. And then I have another question for you. So there was a stream yesterday. Okay, so Reese was there. Got it. So we went through a bit of a case study. Yeah, on a trade. And if you take a look at what I posted in the discord earlier today, what do you notice about this? Different holding than what we reviewed yesterday. But what do you notice about the general looking feel? Super fucking similar. Super fucking similar. So the point is if we use some sort of conditions based rules set, we can find more opportunities that fit those conditions. So this I already have a position on. I started scaling in actually on the gap up today just because again, that's the nature of speculating I put on a small trade to start with. And then as it started running, I literally just scaled in for the first part of the day as it was running its way up. And then as soon as I got the alert that it had broken meaningfully above that resistance line, I finished scaling in the position. And I actually sold a call on top of it that was short dated at a ratio as per usual. Very, very light ratio. It's like 15 covered. So very, very light ratio. And that's it. It's literally running almost an identical setup to what I just showed you in APP. Almost identical. And this I'm still",

It's literally running almost an identical setup to what I just showed you in APP. Almost identical. And this I'm still in, as you can see, like I literally am still continuing to move up the stop and to just run it upside. So the main point there is that if we develop conditions based rules, we can then very efficiently scan for occurrences of those and then try to play them when they look right. So that's the idea. I just thought it was hilarious that literally yesterday we had talked about this setup. And then I mean, if we look at AFRM, it's it's so similar. It's not the same obviously, but it's a very, very similar move overall. Now the scale of the chart and stuff looks different now because it hasn't had that big of a run yet. But we'll see if it does. Who knows? It can always revert back. And what I would do in that instance is just start scaling out because I'm already in for a decent profit at this point. So it would be a really, really simple trade to me. This is one that I essentially would not take a loss on at this point. Unless there's a massive gap down, then I eat the loss. That's how it goes.

For overall brand, it's always a good thing if people are at least somewhat interested to share the stuff that I do. So that I imagine is probably not a bad thing.

Honestly, it's helpful for me to know at least that something like that is going on because I've already told you guys and I tell people this like pretty regularly.

I just kept going with it until it stopped essentially. I'm not gonna lie though. I thought the ending was pretty funny though. That's probably my favorite part of that video. Joey says no squawk box, no squawk box. Nope. Ben Zingha has one, but I don't listen to it. It doesn't matter to me. Like that's not that's not the way that I trade. So catching news as soon as it's happening to try to play those really short term moves. It's not so much my style. Again, what I do is very conditions based.

It was like those conference call tools, but it was always on. And so people would have it on the floor, and then they would have the other end like wherever their office is for their firm. So then it's essentially an open line of communication between the floor and use. So you can hear what's going on, although you're not there. So that's the idea behind a squawk box. It's just for essentially flow of information. Trollbox. That's more, tell me I think that's more accurate. I like that one better. The trollbox. All right. Next question here is what resources, books, courses, mentors had the most significant impact on your development? Options is a strategic investor for sure. And then Nate and Berg's book probably.

And again, this isn't like an end-to-end thing, but it's a starting point. So the short answer to this is I think the way for new traders to filter through the amount of information that's there is actually to create a syllabus for yourself. And then from that syllabus, I would just make sure that it makes sense. You can use literally a book like options as a strategic investment as your basis for your syllabus. And you can create a learning path for yourself. When I try to remind people when it comes to learning anything that you learn in school, there's normally a very defined path. There's test quizzes, projects, stuff like that",

And there's none of that in trading. Most people just kind of go off and you know, go forth and do their best or whatever the case is. And I actually think that's a pretty big mistake. I think that when we try to learn like that, it's very circuitous. We just go around and fucking circles. We learn a little bit here. I call it movement for the sake of movement. Because you might look at a lot of stuff. You might do a lot of stuff, but it doesn't mean that you're actually like deriving a lot of value from all that stuff. So yeah, that's essentially how I would filter through things is I would just be very purposeful with the learning steps. And again, you can use a book like options as a strategic investment. You can use the link that I dropped there, but just think of how you learn in school and create that for learning options. It's kind of like the same thing.

Maybe it's not, you know, a chemical imbalance or stuff like that. And I'm not saying that it doesn't exist. But I absolutely think that we live in a society that leads to those tendencies. And then I think we over diagnosed those tendencies. So if a trader has something like attention deficit, hyperactive, I don't care so much about. But if somebody's attention deficit, the markets are a bad place to be attention deficit, you have to have attention. And you have to have to attention that can be essentially like held for long durations of time, even through very uninteresting or non-moving components. That's just a general mismatch to me. Now again, I would jokingly say I have ADD or ADHD as well. But in a reality, I can fully control my focus. It's just not always easy.

The there's a period that's very easy if you're in like a flow state. But most of the work that I do is not in a flow state. Most of the work that I do is really, really thoughtful, dedicated time to sit down and learn something. And I literally create an architecture for me to do so. It's one of the reasons why I have a standing desk is you'll see me even during the live sessions that are a couple hours long. Part of it is because my back hurts. But I'll sit down, stand up, I will move during it because those changes of pace help refresh my mental clock. I also set very specific work and break windows for myself based on a lot of human lab protocols. I don't disperposely disrupt a flow state. But I respect when I go through periods where I'm effective versus ineffectual. And if I notice myself being ineffectual, I have to differentiate. Is it because of a lack of discipline? And I'm being lazy and easily distracted because I'm not being disciplined or am I literally cognitively fatigued. And I need that 10 minute rest period to go do something else to refresh my mental perspective to then come back into another bout of like very focused work. So again, I think a lot",

Because yeah, like it's really difficult to focus on a lot of this stuff for a lot of people. So Jonathan Colors says, what are some of the non obvious dangers of a 20 strike, Jimmy leap, considering the options are as cheap as they've been since the late 2020s. Obviously being sideways forever. Or as cheap as they've been, I don't know what that means. What does that mean? I don't really know what that means. Obviously, I understand that the inference, but I'm saying from like a broader perspective. I'm grabbing a video for you. So this video is about buying call options smarter.

But I just don't want to low IV, I believe. Okay, let's see. So IVP implied volatility percentile is no. Yeah, that's like that's accurate. I would call that accurate. And then if we're going back to 2020, we need a five year daily. So yeah, I think it's okay to say that. I think on a longer term time frame, the implied volatility is a relatively cheap. I think in general, the implied volatility is typically very high, just in general. So like here, those 17 Jan 25s are actually relatively expensive compared to the 17 April, 25s, which are about like double the duration. So like the 17 Jan's are expensive on a relative basis.

But yeah, no, I think Jonathan, I think what you're saying for whatever Newton was talking about in terms of the cost, I completely agree. Overall, vol is pretty cheap. The problem is is like buying when volatility cheap is not like that's not the move. I wouldn't base it off that at all. You have to remember, volatility is movement. If you buy a call, they make money when it moves. So unless you are structuring a very specific trade to take advantage on the movement of volatility, something like horizontal spread, like a calendar of some sort, or if you're trying to trade like volatility in and of itself, then making the buy decision off of vol is miss. It's really misleading. And the reason is because let's take a look. Sedgwick says, but what if IV is mispriced? It's not. Yeah, so you don't even have to",

I think this is about exactly where I would go. And it's just because of the way that I buy options. Again, it's in that video that I shared up above there. And the 20s, the main issue I have with those is that they're all extrinsic value. Not all. That's kind of dramatic, but it's very, very heavy extrinsic value. Rowan Titty says they were talking leaves January of 26. Oh, shit, I missed that. Sorry. Yeah, it's a lot of extrinsic value. I personally wouldn't like that too much. I would either take a slightly lower, I would take a slightly lower delta, maintain the gamma, take all the extrinsic value and it be cheaper.

Or do I want to go slightly further in the money and scrub off a lot of this extrinsic value? Because the problem is is when volatility is low, it means the stock is not moving. And like, there's a reason why it's low. So when stock is low, when volatility is low, buying options can seem more lucrative from a volatility perspective. But again, it goes back to the profit mechanism. The primary profit mechanism when you buy a call is stock go up. That's the primary profit mechanism. It's not volatility go up. Volatility go up can help you a little bit, but that's not going to be the thing that really moves the needle on the trade. So I would just make sure that you like a trade is structured in the context of the profit mechanism that you're trying to play.

I think that you're characterizing the strategies a little bit wrong by saying like debit spreads didn't work out. Right. It's not, it's not debit spreads not working out. It's the profit mechanism that didn't work out. So I, yeah, I would just be, be clear on that. Rointitty says, why do people buy deep in the money leaps instead of just buying the shares? Leverage.

What's the biggest shift you've seen in the market since you started in 2007. Oh, liquidity has gone up massively. There's a lot more volatility. And the edge in a lot of things that I used to trade is definitely contracted without a doubt. So yeah, I think that's mostly it. Where do you see your trading career headed in the next five years? Fuck if I know. And are there new markets or strategies you're excited to explore? Fuck. I didn't realize that I'm getting like fucking deep questions here. Shit, I don't know. Next five years, I expect to continue trading, unless I make a massive error at some point, which is not beyond me. That's for sure. And there's not really any new strategies that I'm excited to explore. I guess they're like exploring something like event markets. That's kind of interesting to me. I'm generally excited about that. But I mean beyond that, not so much. Like most of what I do is it's the same stuff. That's actually why I have the time now to sit here and dive into GameStop and stuff like that because it's kind of like side quests.

My goals in the beginning were to aggressively grow my account. So I would be very aggressive with positioning for quite some time. And that's not so much the case anymore. I mean, I'm very open about what my annual return targets are. But I've already talked about this conundrum I found myself in where last year was my best trading year that I've ever had.

So I'm just kind of trading opportunities as they continue to pop up. So that's kind of the way I expect to continue trading. The only thing I have to be really, really careful about is not overextending myself. And that's easy to do. I'm pretty good at monitoring the total risk.

So yeah. Mark says do you know why the net gas D's 24 options are slightly skewed creating a two six two eight. And the 30 delta shore put is 280. Yep. We know exactly why that's happening. So if you take a look at net gas, you're out there in D's right. So you need to use the Z 24 expiration cycle. So right now you're looking at net gas at spot. You need to use the correct contract when you're evaluating the price for the for the future or for the option on the future. So that's why you're seeing that. So realistically that 30 delta short put strike price is 280 relative to this to this three dot 0 5 0. Cool. Well, that's all I got for you guys.

So musk in his wild promises is probably he delivers on far more of them than I can think of just about anybody else. And he thinks really big.",

But let me see. Where is let me go to Tesla. All right, let's see. Is it all music? Damn, like 50 minutes of this thing are here. From supervised full self driving to unsupervised full self driving where the car you could fall asleep and wake up at your destination. Like that's really cool. But there's also a challenge for a lot of people that cars cost too much. I mean, when you fact we I think the the cost of autonomous transport will be so low that you can think of it like individualized mass transit. The average cost of a bus per mile per city. Sorry, I don't want to be yes, yes, yes, all our cars basically all cars that we make. So one of the things that like is really interesting is how will this affect the cities that we live in? This looks so cool. These things are, I mean, this is insane. This is why I actually really, really revere Elon Musk is because like he's moving at a pace that just about nobody else can with this shit. So it's like, I",

I can't like just think of what nobody else is doing any of this shit. Like that's that's the reality is there's so far fucking behind. And he's not even necessarily, you know, super close to it, right? He's talking about concepts here. But still like he's so far fucking ahead of everybody. And everybody has the ability to compete with him, right? Like there's a lot of big companies. But even if you look at Bezos and what they're trying to do with what blue origin, like they're so far behind. It's it's I don't want to say it's comical. That's kind of dramatic. But it is they're very, very far behind, which I don't know, like it I think it puts musk in such a such a different atmosphere. So yeah.

That kind of stuff I think matters a lot, especially when you're trying to he's making quite literally world changing stuff starlink is a complete game changer. And that's nothing that musk needed to do. A lot of other people could have done starlink. It's not a crazy concept, but musk did it. And he did it really well. So I look at a lot of stuff that what he does is it's just insane. It's absolutely incredible. That's just people remember cyber truck being four years late. So this could be late. Sure, it could be late. But I don't think that it like the the robot taxi being late matters that much again.

That is the exact kind of move that as soon as this starts to base a little bit. If it didn't have earnings, I would absolutely play it to the upside. Because I don't I don't buy that move for a minute. But it's too early to tell because this is where the next low is. So we need to see how it fares in here, which is it's too early plus it has earnings coming up. So yeah, interesting find though. I actually need to watch that a little bit. I'm kind of curious.
