The problem is the system is broken. I had tighter compliance restrictions when I was a consultant for Deloitte, working on decks on a very small business segment for them than the speaker of the house who influences the movement of bills that directly interfaces with single holdings in her portfolio, case and point in video. Last month, they established a position in a video. And now this month, they're talking about the chips bill, which overall I like the chips bill increases domestic production of chips in the US, like that, but big problem with her being able to have an individual position and something like that. It shouldn't be the case. The conflict of interest erodes confidence and that's the issue I have with it.",
