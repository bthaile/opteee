Do you all love stargazing and dreaming? I have a Celestron telescope, literally right there. I'm looking at it in my office, love space. It is probably one of my biggest non-market related nerd hobbies. And I don't like charting stars and shit like that. I don't really care about cataloging stuff, but I find it always humbling to think about the scope and size of things and the structure of things. So yeah, very much so. Literally, I have, yeah, I have a couple telescopes. Most of them are super expensive that I can hook up to like a computer. And then I can like look for specific things, track certain things. And it's always absolutely fascinating. Fun story about that telescope though. I had a bunch of friends over one night and I wasn't drinking because I'm kind of, I don't really drink that much anymore, but a lot of my marine buddies still drink exactly as you imagine as most marines would drink, which is fucking, egregiously heavily.

There's actually filters that we put on them so that you don't nuke your eyes. So this dude is like standing outside for like 20 minutes, eyes adjusted to the dark in my backyard, drunk hanging out, and then he like goes to bend over. And like look at the telescope and he like reels back. And he was just like, dude, it feels like the fucking moon just came in my eye. And he's just like sitting there holding his eye close. So every time I look at that telescope now, I think of the moon coming in my friend's eye, which is a, it's a fond memory. I have to be honest. I, I don't want to say that I wouldn't have prevented it if I knew that the cloud was going to move and stuff.

That's actually where we flew into when we went to Alaska. Oh yeah, while we're here, I'll show you what we did. When we flew into Alaska, we landed here. We drove here, stayed here.

Stayed here. This is where we did the helicopter stuff. We stayed here for a few days. There's a really cool view of this glacier. Took a boat. Actually, that spot that we stayed on the boat was over here, actually. Orca Island cabins right in there. So you literally have to take, it's like a pretty long boat ride. It's like 40 minutes across there. Then we came all the way back, all the way back. Then the last night we stayed down in here. Is this right? No, I lied to you down in here. This area. Then we walked the lake before we bounced. We have South Korea. I think we already have South Korea. Let's zoom out. Let's see. Some Koreas. Oh, we don't. Nice. Great call. South Korea. Get that one.

But I'm not fixing a, I'm not fixing a fucking fly through this shit. That's for sure. Yeah. Okay. That's great to know. There ain't no way. Oh, wait, there's another McCain. Yo, Florida. What the fuck? So hold on. So there's Debbie. That was three to nine. Then there's Pauline on the 26th of September. What is this madness? Yo, shout out to fucking Florida. Shit. That ain't no joke. They got screwed too. Okay. They swags as maybe bring a rain jacket. I feel like the rain is less of the concern with the hurricane. I think the correct response is maybe bring a fucking parachute. Something like that. Because I'm less concerned about getting wet. I'm more concerned about my plane being sucked up in a hurricane and jostled around like it's in a blender and then subsequently post-haced crashing into earth without landing gear without like a, you know, a nice glide plane coming in.

That's more what I'm concerned about. Less so much the old rain. So yeah. Lances, you don't want a parachute and those kind of wins. No, no, there's nothing about me that says I want to go skydiving. But there is something that says I would take a parachute and run the risk of getting blown around in a hurricane. Shoot all get all tied up and stuff. That's fine. That's there's at least a shot. Otherwise, if you're in a plane that is crashing, the outcome is already known from the onset of that experience. There is no other chance. So lock that. Ain't no way. Ain't going to be me. Okay. Well, this was highly educational. And I now know we need to make some travel plan changes. So whoever is down here in Florida, fucking shout out to you and good luck home.

It's like less than half the population apparently lives near. I'm just saying. This is exactly why when it comes, this is exactly why when it comes to analyzing information, I'm highly skeptical of everything always, always because you have to check it. Zacharias says within one or two hundred miles. Yes. So that says within 60 miles. 100 kilometers. If you're 200 miles from the ocean, like you're not near the fucking ocean anymore, like you're several hours from the coast. So I don't even consider 100 miles that close. You're like, you're not that close at that point. If you're 100 miles away, like that, that's a massive distance. So I don't buy that. I actually think 60 miles is pretty gracious. I would call it like 40 to 50 miles. I think that's coastal because even here in California, right? Like let's use this as an example. I personally do not consider the Anzo Barrego Desert coastal, but by the 100 mile definition, let's see maps. Let's take a little peek of boo. And then let's do San Diego to Anzo Barrego.

I think if we can get one from either of those, both of those groupings, that would be about perfect. 81.4 of the population lives in coastal states.

That would be very fun. So definitely at some point. So we have our workbook all set up. We have DIVs stuff over here. I am going to condense this down a bit. I don't, I'm not going to keep this scratch stuff. Not going to keep that scratch stuff or that and clean this all up for us. So it's nice and readable. We left off 16 April, which is, I think his last before he came back. So now, let's, let's get it. So we have two June. So he was gone for 11 43 days. And let's get into the weeds, shall we? This I'm going to squish down. And then this I'm going to squish down so that they fit. And I'm going to take this out a little bit further. It might be hard for you to see all zoom in when we need to. Okay. So total gain is six, eight, six, three, one, six, one, dot five, five, five, hash, 29, 27, six, 400, five, six, value to 10, six, seven, six, 400, five, six, big big change. So now we're holding. We have five million shares. At 21, got 274, plus 120, okay. 21 June, 20 calls. All right. Let's spend, let's spend some time here. So one thing I want",

All right. Let's spend, let's spend some time here. So one thing I want to do is see if we can deconstruct when, when these were entered. The shares are way more tricky. Way more tricky. Because with that big of a gap, we can either come with the assumption that he held his shares that whole time and then built up. Or we use another assumption that he traded in and out around the shares. I have, I literally have no idea. And there's no way for us to know because games stop traded all over the map. Let's do a quick look at the, the share. Vladimir says easily grew to 200,000 with just trading shares a few times between April 21 and mid-May. Well, first, let's, I understand what you mean by easily, right? Like it's very possible. That's, I agree. I don't think he would have done it with shares. Just don't see that. And the reason why I don't see that is because from what we've seen so far, he's not decreased share position. And he really likes to use options. So my personal opinion, again, this, I can't justify this other than by what I've been learning by studying the movements. By personal opinion is that the movement,",

Sure, let's take a look. I don't, I honestly don't think that matters whatsoever, but happy to take a look. And I'll explain why I don't think it matters whatsoever. Because again, as I'm looking more and more at his older videos, I'm learning a lot. And it's actually funny because I see somebody who's very, very much verbally processing on these live streams, which is fascinating. Right? Because it's not this really refined discrete picture. He admits to when he's making mistakes, which are numerous, like all of us. Again, this is not saying anything negative about him.

And I think that he obviously uses massively heavy leverage. That is the overwhelming contributor to how this has worked out so far for him that I can see clear as day. But the way that we're entering and moving around trades is completely different. Renegade says him and R.C. are communicating via tweets. No doubt about it. I think there's a heavy doubt about that. But before we get further, you already know. We got to get uniform appropriate for this part. Because we're talking about some theories now. None of this, none of this can be proven or disproven. These are all straight up theories. But I do not think him and R.C. are communicating at all. And the reason why I think that is because if they do that, the probability of them, if that ever, if one of them either or is investigated for any reason for anything related to this, if there's any sort of communication direct communication between them, like DMing, talking about the future of the company, straight like anything like that.

Well, I mean, technically all of you can anybody that is a shareholder can be on the earnings call. So you just dial in. So yeah, that's like shareholders gain access to the earnings calls inherently. You don't have to be an outsized, outsized trade there. RC's latest tweets equal.

Like he's literally just trolling. He's just fucking around. He's saying the same, he's saying the same stuff like I do when I say like, oh, well, as soon as I put on a trade, you know, it's going to go the other way, right? Like that's ingest. It's fucking around. So when I look at, when I look at this and it says like, what's an exit strategy? He clearly has one. And he deployed it through the life cycle of the positions. And then with this movement to Chui, whatever that looks like, however that looks, again, we don't know. But there are like, it's clear he has fucking exit strategies is the main point. And this is him, I think, playing around. That's what I think here. So yeah, so going back to Ryan Cohen's latest tweets, I think that it's mostly him playing around. Same reason why he has a picture of these fucking brown shorts. Because he knows when he does stuff like this, people are going to do what this guy's asking",

I really don't, again, like this. I don't, like, I don't think there's a meeting behind this one personally. And he also says there is no meaning behind it. So that's not to suggest that there are not hidden meanings. Absolutely not. I don't believe that. I think that there definitely could be. But I think deciphering the elements that are kind of, you know, just contrived and put in there for fun or for whatever reason versus the things that might have some sort of meaning behind it, it kind of highlights the broader point that, that's like if somebody wanted to communicate via these kinds of messages and memes, they would be very clear.

So my thought is, when somebody is trying to communicate with memes, hieroglyphics as we jokingly call them, different kinds of indirect communication modalities, I do not think if you're trying to communicate something, you would shroud it so deeply. I don't think that because then it becomes non-communication. It becomes like who the fuck knows what it actually means, right? So when you look at something like this, this looks like pretty clear.

I don't think roaring kitty sat down and thought for each emoji in this timeline, it's going to have a specific meaning.

That is the, that is the underlying concept I have with respect to indirect communication is the entire, the entire idea of indirect communication is to still communicate. It's not to confuse, it's not to confound, it's not to mislead, it's to communicate. So if you make indirect communication so confounding that nobody can follow it, then it's not communicating. And I believe the majority of what he's trying to do is communicate and troll. That's what I think. I think he fucks around a lot. And then I also think he communicates a lot. And I think it's real difficult to",

This is somebody that, if you recall, from the very beginning of the trades that we started following, if we go back to the bottom of this, this is somebody that took 100,000 and dropped them all into call options on an individual stock. And here's another thing that I can tell you definitively from the live streams that I listened to today. He actually talked heavily about how he would be upset with himself for being missized, for being too diluted and too diversified. He literally said that in a stream that I was watching today. So I think over here, like this is survivor ship bias because he did not have some sort of grand timing thesis behind this trade. The timing thesis behind the trade was, I think it's going to go up. Right. And it's come and it's based on this really in depth analysis that he conducted, right? Based on valuations.

Again, Royne Kitty is super smart. He is not smarter than everybody looking at this combined. He's just not. Nobody is. Elon Musk is a fucking genius.

And then I want to look at two June 24. So to do that, I already have those dates from a bar chart export. So I'm going to upload those into our family favorite. I'll probably do. Yeah, I'll start with chat GPT. And then depending on what chat GPT shows me if I believe it or not, then I might look at something else. So I'm throwing into chat GPT and I wanted to do a few things. First things first, analyze the price performance of GME from 17 April 2021 to June 2024. Great. As statistical overview of the price of the price behavior. And then I'll work with that a little bit. Sean says, RK showed us he figured something out by using Chewie as another example. I wonder. Yeah, I wonder. The Chewie thing is really, really interesting because it didn't do much. Like it didn't from his entry point versus his exit point. So if we look, we think he got in on like the 24th of",

Do you want to have dollars? Like, it's really not much. So I think I don't think again here that this was like the forecast of some sort of thing. And I do think this was market manipulation. And I'm not admonishing him for that at all. But I think that's what that is there clearly. I think that he knows with him being on the fucking news that what he says is now tracked. And I think it's him playing games. I think it's him trolling a little bit with this whole thing. That's what I think. Because this kind of movement, again, I think he filed what the 13G was for 24 June, something like that. So yeah. Michael, Michael, calm down, bro, chill. We're going to look.

Low is 12. Min. I don't care about those. Let's look at the medians. So the median opens 24.91. High is 26.01. Low is 24. So very range bound in general. And then the maximum prices open was 75 78. High was 86 17. Low is 72 88. Then close was 75 64. Okay. So that gives us some idea about renegade traders. Those dude look at the chart. Forget chat GPT. Yo. Y'all got a chill. I'm gonna. I'm",

But what I'm doing is I understand when I look at something like a chart, my eyes are going to see certain things based on how my conscious mind is primed. So by conducting an objective statistical analysis of something before looking at it, it helps reset the subconscious priming that's in my mind. And I can get a sense of what average, what medians actually look like statistically, not what my mind is going to pick up from the charts. Because it is a really, really easy process to have your perception skewed by the thousands of charts you looked at before, the things that you tend to see. I don't want any of that. When I conduct analysis, you will find that I literally go to extreme lengths to curtail my known cognitive biases that I know are there. It's the only way for me to arrive at like truly good information as far as I'm concerned. So that's why I'm doing this. Okay, so that being said, it is now time to look at the chart. So",

Now, first question is you know this better than I do, which is why I'm asking you. What was going on in the general space during this period of time? And why did he choose 16 April to leave? Do we know the answers to that? Because I don't know the answers to those. And I'm very interested in what they are if we do know. And the reason why I'm interested in it is a few things. Renegade says can you repeat the questions? Yeah, sorry. Yeah, and let me not do multiple questions. I do that a lot. I'd like, yeah, I try to condense too much. The first question is do we know why he left on 16 April? I think that's the first, the first question I have. And then I'll ask my second question after we get through that first question.

Call to testify to Congress. Is that when it happened? So so roaring kitty Congress testimony. That was the 18th of February. Is what I see. Off, off, Poon says they think the squeeze already slows and his calls expired that day. He didn't know how to value the stock. I don't think that's it. The reason why I don't think that's it is because my estimation is that it has something to do with this in probably legal counsel. He received from his attorneys. That's my guess. So I think the the calls expiring and stuff like that completely agree. I think that's probably why the date lined up. But I think the reason why we didn't see more posts after that is not because of the expiration and not knowing how to value it. I think it had pretty much everything to do with this. And the fact that he knew that he was going to have to testify. So that's my best guess. But I don't know. And that's my best guess as of right now. This looks like a like a fuckboy tin hat when it's like on top of my head, like you know, perched on top of my head like that. I don't like that. We got to get that",

Lance says I think there was some sort of gag order that wasn't public knowledge that came from the 16th. 18th Fed. Yeah. Renegade says he did return early June 21 with the tweet storm. Okay, so let's take a look. Yeah. So then my guess is if he came back with the tweet storm in June of 21, but he wasn't doing yellow updates. I almost have to the overwhelming reason why that would likely be the case is if he was advised by attorneys. That's my guess. So and the reason why he would be advised by attorneys like that is to literally to limit his own risk. That's just de-risk that whole thing. That's my best guess. But let's take a look at the tweet storm. How hard is it? What am I going to get myself into? How hard is this to go back in time? Oh, this is wait, they're gone. Oh, he deleted stuff. I forgot. In case you guys didn't know, I'm pretty sure. Wait, let me not give bad news. He deleted shit, right? Okay, got it. Sorry. Correction, belay",

No, that's in 24, right? The guy that like pitches forward. Again, I'm looking for 2021 when he came back. Because that was from April. Hold on, let me get my bearings.

So this to me looks like he's returning, right? That's that's what this scene from John Wick was. He was retired. He was not doing the thing anymore.

I don't we're not gonna stream though. It's just for a conversation. If there's anything that we should talk about, let me know. But I don't really have. Don't have much for the agenda. It's more so. Just talking about some qualitative stuff. He's a good dude. I really like him. Like anytime that I come across somebody like that, that like I genuinely vibe with and get along with.

And it's like super, super frustrating to me. So anytime that I come across people that seem to be like really genuine and good, I try to connect with them more again. I don't know him. So I could be wrong, but it doesn't feel like I'm wrong. It feels like in general. Um, I don't know. It feels like in general. He just seems like a really solid dude. That Lauren says he's so young and so smart. He's not that young. That's another funny thing that we came across on the live stream. I literally he's late twenties. I'm not going to dox him. He's like really interested or like trying to preserve his, um, you know, anonymity and whatnot. But yeah, he's he's not that young. I think in that that's not anything he didn't say because on the on the live stream, he said, oh, he was. But yeah, he's he's in his late twenties. So he's probably I'm guessing. Um, five years",

I'm going to ask you. Interesting. This is from GPT. It says 28 November 29 saw notable surge in price 30 24 hours. No specific company news. Heavy volumes. Speculation around a squeeze spike. The surge was likely driven by meme stock traders speculating on potential sort squeezes. Reminiscent of 2021. Interesting. The interesting thing here is how it kicked off.

One thing I can tell you unequivocally is every. Every single time I've seen game stop jump every single time. I see a massive expansion and volume leading into the jump. Again, do not take the null statement from that. That does not mean every massive expansion in volume means a jump doesn't. Right. So in this case, we went from 1.68 to 7.43 massive expansion and volume it dumped. But even here, I can see volume from the 24th 1.2. It goes to 3.7 and then it goes to 14. It is every single time I've looked at every single gap every single large moving game stop and it is uniform. Michael says what and what do you summarize as to why that might be? Oh, easy because markets are highly informed. That's why it's why I go back to saying that there are no specific dates because if it is, it's going to get arbitrage away nearly immediately. These are people with different kinds of information that are seeing different kinds of movements that are piggybacking and moving off of. Good movement.

And there is a non correlation between when we see big swaps coming due in subsequent price movement, it's not predictive of price movement. And the reason for that, we actually talked a lot about this during the the PB episode that I did on Thursday. But you do not know and cannot know what is in a swap.

So we cannot discreetly know if big swap is coming due does that mean somebody's going to have to go to the market and buy it probably not because again it's the same reason why we have dark pools. It's to shroud movement. So why on earth would we have swaps that if they come due that there's going to be the transfer of stock and some component that comes from the market. All literally all entities if that were the case would see it would front run it would skyrocket price before they touched it and then nobody would use swaps ever again because they would get murdered. So that's not it. And it's important again to try and remember like objective analysis because one of the issues I see when a lot of the apes will look at stuff like this. They'll say something like let's say swaps did come due this day right and they'll say something like we'll swap.

So we have to do that's why it moved and it's again completely fair idea to start with but we have to analyze the entire idea you we can't just look at the instances where it happens to line up. We have to look at all instances of when swaps are due and we need to again analyze it statistically as these swaps come due how frequently are we seeing a big move. So it's really insignificant it tells me the move is not caused by just the swaps emphasis on just because there could be swaps that come due that necessitate going to the market to purchase shares. Do I think that that's a high likelihood in severity no I don't and again it's because there are there is no benefit to the swap if an underlying is going to move that's the whole purpose of a swap of derivatives is to not deal with the underlying and to deal with this contract pertaining to the underlying. So again did swaps have anything to do with this absolutely could have I do not know was this all swaps that caused this objectively know I know that not to be the case. So yeah something happened here though very interesting I wonder if there's a way to look at like is there",

I don't think it exists in stock tweets. Type equity. Yeah it shows stock tweets but I don't think it goes back far enough.

Now, let's say we know the date is somewhere between mid-April. April, you know, 13 April, it looks like. And then it comes back down to 17th, right? If I know a date and I know the date starting back here when the stock is trading in late April, again, let's say that you're saying the 24 to 26. So let's go back to the midpoint there just for the example. Let's go to April 25th. And let's say I know those dates, right? Those dates are going to be sometime between May 13th and 17th, right? I know for whatever reason, or even if I think, if I don't know, if I think with a very high probability that there's going to be a move in that period, we just finished our mango orange. We're moving on to the reserve mango orange. So you know, it's getting real. Let's take a look. So again, I know that that date is going to be mid-May. Let's check out the options.

The reason why I go to 17 May is because it's the closest primary expiration that I can build a position in. But what I can guarantee you is that if I know dates, I'm not going to go out to June. So if we take a look at his position, he is 21 June, 24, 20 calls. That's out here. Not here. That's the first thing. The second thing is I wouldn't bother with the 20s and I would go further, even the 25s. There's still plenty liquid, but there are a lower delta. And again, they're going to give me a higher compounding capability. Royne Titty says maybe... Yeah, Michael, we know when the trades come in for sure. Yeah, we know that they came in in in April. Yeah, there's no debate there. What I'm trying to explain to you is that if I have a date, and I think that there's going to be a big movement for whatever reason in mid-May, I do not go to June.

And I'm telling you what the optimal trade is here. No, Michael, he did not do that. Look at his position. 21 June. What I'm highlighting is that his first position when he came back and posted on 2 June. 21 June. I think I see what you're saying now. So you're saying before this update, you think he bought near-term options traded those without doing the update. Code of. To me, it's a fruitless thing. No idea. It's impossible to prove. Now I want to deconstruct this position. Rapture says that's how I think he got the capital from 50 million to 20 million. The problem is it doesn't again, it doesn't line up, right?

Again, let's take a look on a trade, I traded GameStop during this. So fun fact, some of the activity that it, depending on what periods we look at, is me. And the reason why I highlight that is because if I'm seeing the activity, literally everybody in Jesus sees the activity. But the first thing I want to show you is this, look at the volume in the stock, 2 million, 2 million, 4 million, 2 million, 10 million, 17 million, 8 million, 4 million, 4 million, 3 million. What I'm highlighting is pre-earnings quiet volume at earnings high volume post earnings sustained stock volume to a degree. So then before this big squeeze here, we have, Michael says, oh man, no need to argue, just look at my sales. It's dude, your argument is it doesn't matter. Like there's no, there's nothing there. Specifically, that we can clearly identify as anything. It just, it like, nothing, it doesn't make sense. And again, I'm not saying that he couldn't have done any of that.

So the main issue that I take with the overall argument, even if he knows the dates and all that stuff taken that for granted, he's not going to put on a fucking options position on a 34. Again, that's that's even saying in we're taking it as here that when he exited 34 million dollars of a portfolio, he's not going to put 500,000 into a trade. It literally doesn't even make sense. It's such a trivial amount of money for somebody like that. It literally doesn't make sense. So granting all the other points that we cannot, we literally cannot verify, we cannot verify.

The other stuff that literally could be something we have to consider is that there was the big Netflix movie that came out.

But I'm using that exact point you're making in highlighting that he didn't do that. Because when he posted, again, for this update thing, he posted at a point where GameStop was trading what is trading in here. So he posted over the weekend here, I guess, for that two June or whatever he came back. But the options that he had in two June were out to 21 June. Right? Like if he knew the dates were this, he wouldn't have gone out that far. He would have gone closer. So again, it just doesn't make sense. So yeah. Okay, back to this. All right. So right now, I'm just updating the dates so that we can track the equity curve movement. The oct was. Oh, perfect. I can move this way faster 15 oct. 22 oct 30 oct. 8 Ds. 90s. 14 Ds.

For the equity variance relation to Jimmy. Price movement equals this minus that divided by yes, please. And then this will all be a percentage. And then we're going to format it. Nope. Not color. I guess we could use a color scale. Okay. Yep. That's good. And then the other thing I do want to analyze though is from start to finish. So this. This minus. This is what about this. And again, the other problem with this is I actually need to go back a little further. Because I miss some of these. Um. But let's just take a quick look. I'm just kind of curious here. So this is the value of options. So he did 2164 better than just long equity. I could have produced for him. So this is a lot of options.

Renegade trader says you're not giving any credit to the counter arguments, which are valid. Yeah, that's the problem though. Like when somebody isn't interested in trying to find like true information. It's a really common argumentative technique where somebody will just continue to reiterate their point or try to convince you to their point. Which is always like I can always very clearly tell that's not somebody that's interested in finding truth. They're interested in trying to convey and convince of their argument happens all the time. That's actually one of the big issues that traders have is traders very frequently have a big problem where they attach their identity and their ego to a trade.

I can see somebody scaling in at size again, pretty easy to find the fucking cat. So let's take a look at these 20s. And we're going to go to the strike. I'm just going to run the 20s for now.

So we have to figure out when this thing got built, which is going to be a little bit of a tricky prospect, but we will navigate through it. So now what I need to do is add another tab. And this will be RK. What is this? The 21 June. 20s. And let's take a look. So this is going to be date. This is going to be time. I want both of those specifically in this instance. This is going to be size. This will be. It's all the same. I'm going to keep it the same up here. This will be the 21 June 20 calls. All of these will be for that. Okay. And then. This off put and says super easy and toss. You can see daily volume and I know dude. I've been using toss since 2007. Super familiar. That's it doesn't have the details that I want. So. Well, not not any more convenient than this. It's essentially the same same. So yeah. Okay. So now let's start looking at these dates. I wish there was like a dual sort here. That would be. Much more preferable. We start on",

So if we look at what is this 21 June. Well, I already have it up here. Let's just take a look. 21 June 24 equals this minus this. Yeah, so it's still a month out even from here. So it's not like it's a very short dated option. That's still a pretty meaningful amount of time. So it's 20 May. Now let's take a look at 21 May.

But again, we genuinely don't know. Because the overall options chain here was actually pretty active. So there's a good chance that other people were, because again, I saw the activity. And that's one of the reasons why I started trading GameStop like quite literally right around this period is because I saw the options chain being hit literally this, which was absolutely insane. So I ended up starting buying into it straight up for that precise reason. So as I was doing that, I know for sure other people were doing it. Because if I see it, I know other people see it. 21 May. Off Putin says May 22, the volume was 77. Most was Gil. Well, we don't know. But yeah, I mean, it's a fair assumption. Most of the volume, I think in general, I think can easily be logically attributed to the cat. Simply because, I mean, his position size is massive, right? So it takes time to put these positions on.

Because there's going to be a bunch of these that I'm sure that he didn't just get at the offer, but I'm just going to break it down one piece at a time here. So 22 May. We have a bunch. We have 1138 49. And then I saw another question up above. Inder says, can't you data scraper? Did I miss something? We can definitely can. So when I was originally looking at like the overall position here, it's actually like precisely what I did that piece together the total thing.

    "text": "at like the overall position here, it's actually like precisely what I did that piece together the total thing. I like it's, I mean, it sounds weird, but it is what it is. I like being intimate with the data. So my preference for something like this, if you take a look at like the series, right, it's analyzing Rory Kitty's trades. So I am trying to like quite literally analyze them. So the process of analyzing is very in depth for me. But I do it so that I understand all of the nuance around what happened. That's my goal. It's why we why I've gone through piece by piece. So it's much slower. This is not something that I do in general for most things I'm looking at. But if I'm going to take the time to quote unquote deep dive something, like I'm going to to deep dive it even if it is time consuming, which this is. But that's okay because as I do this, I get a better understanding. So one of the things I've noticed so far with these entries is that a lot of them are in the morning or I'm sorry in the afternoon closer to the close, which is what I would expect. For most professional traders, that's a very common time to put on larger positions because there's a lot of liquidity. But I can still see that he's splitting it a little bit and there are some prospecting positions",

I don't need that fucking on my data. And that was 3.13. All of Putin says don't forget fees and commissions. Yeah, I don't think they'll have commissions here. But yeah, you're absolutely right. It's super expensive. We did an analysis on this not too long ago looking at the prospects of some of his other positions, whether taking to expiration or unwinding. And commissions definitely will have a play. So 11, 15, 53. And then those are 2.9. And then 0, 8, 52, 37. That's a 2.5. And then here we have 11, 28, 29. And these are at 3.1. Okay.

One of the parts that I don't understand from this is why why the scaling that he did like 20 May 21 May like two very light days followed by this massive bulk day. And then a handful more because the other thing I can infer from this is that it doesn't look like there was like a discrete sizing expectation like I'm not sure if he actually planned to get to like 120. It actually almost looks like he planned to get to 100. What does this add up to 25 now. I don't think he would have done 95 that's kind of weird. That's really interesting.

    "text": "120. It actually almost looks like he planned to get to 100. What does this add up to 25 now. I don't think he would have done 95 that's kind of weird. That's really interesting. The reason why it's so interesting to me is like the periods that he bought in what the stock was doing makes sense because I've seen him do this plenty of times before where he scales into things as they go down. That's not new at all. I wonder what the terminal position size was expected to be. Is that I'm not sure if that was defined. It doesn't look like it was defined to me. Fascinating. Man. Fucking cool. I have to noodle on this a little bit more, but I got to get off. I got to go eat dinner and stuff. I didn't realize it's fucking eight o'clock happens quick. Absolutely blast hanging out with you guys. Thank you guys for looking at this all with me and the information really enjoy the dialogue. I will follow up when we have kind of the next podcast or game stop specific. But otherwise we do have the GME live stream next Saturday same same there. And then I will talk to you all throughout the week so you want some of the other live streams as always be an outlier. I'll see you all later.",
