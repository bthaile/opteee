I think he's the favorite by a landslide in that fight rightfully so. We got Lance, we got CDIJ seedage. I guess if I say that, we'll call that a seedage. I love your interview with Peruvian Bull. Thank you. Yeah, for sure. I enjoyed it. Yeah, I liked it a lot. I had a anytime I have to pick up different pieces of this whole thing. It's worth it to me because again, one of the things I think is important, especially as I spend time doing like these live streams and stuff, is one, I learn a lot, but two, it's also to try and give back as much as I can with the information that I'm learning and then to share the information more broadly, right? Like that's the whole idea behind it. So, I'm glad that the conversation was awesome. I enjoyed it a lot. He is a lot of interesting perspectives. I like that he's that's the first time I've ever spoken with him. So, I didn't know how that was going",

You never know if like, because I've come, I've had some offline conversations with some people who honestly like I wouldn't spend a lot of time talking to, simply because I'm interested in information. I'm not interested in like heavily weighted opinions that are biased. And what that means is if somebody has an opinion that's based on information, I want to hear that. But if somebody just has a random opinion just because they feel like having an opinion, I couldn't possibly fucking care less about that. So, I find sometimes some of the people that I'll have conversations with do fall into that ladder camp where they'll have things that they want to say, but then when I probe a little bit to try to understand, it's not because I'm trying to prove somebody wrong. I could, there's no right or wrong, right? Like it's literally just what is factual versus what's not. And some people they just clearly start buckling when we're trying to pull a thread a little bit to follow a thought.

But I find some people, they don't, well, they don't like the work part of it, right? Which is to find the information to formulate an idea. So, where did I leave off?

Do you all love stargazing and dreaming? I have a Celestron telescope literally right there. I'm looking at it in my office. Love space. It is probably one of my biggest non market related nerd hobbies. And I don't like charting stars and shit like that. But like I don't really care about cataloging stuff. But I find it always humbling to think about the scope and size of things and the structure of things. So yeah, very much so. Literally I have, yeah, I have a couple telescopes.

Long story short, set the telescope up, easy big target looking at the moon. And they like the moon was behind a cloud. And the cloud had like shifted out right as somebody was like bending over to look. And if you're losing a really good telescope, it is fucking bright, really bright. There's actually filters that we put on them so that you don't nuke your eyes. So this dude is like standing outside for like 20 minutes, eyes adjusted to the dark in my backyard drunk hanging out and then he like goes to bend over. And like look at the telescope and he like reels back. And he was just like dude, it feels like the fucking moon just came in my eye. And he's just like sitting there holding his eye close. So every time I look at that telescope now, I think of the moon coming in my friend's eye, which is a it's a fond memory. I have to be honest.

Yeah, I feel a little bad about that because you want to like be able to help your friends and you know, take care of your friends, but sometimes a little bit of pain for your friend is worth the overall humor.

Then we went down this way. We stayed over here, came back in, down moves past, down to Seward. stayed here. This is where we did the helicopter stuff. We stayed here for a few days. There's a really cool view of this glacier. Took a boat. Actually, that spot that we stayed on the boat was over here. Actually, Orca Island cabins right in there. It's like a pretty long boat ride.

No, no, there's nothing about me that says I want to go skydiving. But there is something that says I would take a parachute and run the risk of getting blown around in a hurricane. Shoot all get all tied up and stuff. That's fine. That's there's at least a shot. Otherwise, if you're in a plane that is crashing, the outcome is already known from the onset of that experience. There is no other chance. So lock that. Ain't no way. Ain't going to be me. Okay. Well, this was highly educational. And I now know we need to make some travel plan changes.

But this happens like every year. I'm just saying I'm just saying if it happens every year, it might not be the place to live. I'm just fucking saying I'm just saying it might not be the spot to live. I get it home where the heart is, fucking move the heart that somewhere that doesn't flood. But getting smashed by hurricanes, I just think is. I don't know. I guess it's yeah. So I'd rather be skiing says, but it's paradise. I've been a Florida. For me, it's fucking swampy. It's super humid. I like Florida a lot to be super clear. Big fan. But I get straight up disrespected by the mosquitoes there and it is humid AF. So I don't know if I would call that paradise. But that aside, the tax picture is definitely paradise that I get. But there's also other ways around that that's a whole other live stream.

I genuinely don't know what it actually is. What percentage of the human population lives near a coast? I think it's a lot. Okay. So first of all, Zacharias, this is the problem of saying shit, of just saying shit that you've heard somewhere. I'm just saying. This is the problem of just saying shit. It's like less than half the population apparently lives near. Just say it. This is exactly why when it comes, this is exactly why when it comes to analyzing information, I'm highly skeptical of everything always, always because you have to check it. Zacharias says within one or 200 miles. Yeah. So that says within 60 miles, 100 kilometers. If you're 200 miles from the ocean, like you're not near the fucking ocean anymore, like you're several hours from the coast. So I don't even consider 100 miles that close. You're like, you're not that close at that point. If you're 100 miles away, like that, that's a massive distance. So I don't buy that. I actually think 60 miles is pretty gracious. I would call it like 40 to 50 miles. I think that's coastal because even here in California, right? Like let's use this as an example.

This is 70 miles away. Not coastal. Not hit me with that bullshit. So damn you, Zachariah. Have me out here thinking 80 percent. It's 40. Nonsense. Okay, I think we have our map updated. If you guys can, as always, continue scouring for people because we really could use Greenland for sure. That would be fucking sick. What is this here? Svalbard. If we can get a svalbardian. Or, oh, I don't know if it's Tasmania or Madagascar. What do you guys think? If we were to set our sites, I want either a Greenlander or a svalbardian. That's the first request.

Let's spend let's spend some time here. So one thing I want to do is see if we can deconstruct when when these were entered. The shares are way more tricky way more tricky because with that big of a gap, we can either come with the assumption that he held his shares that whole time and then built up or we use another assumption that he traded in and out around the shares. I have I literally have no idea. And there's no way for us to know because game stop traded all over the map. Let's do a quick look at the the share. Vladimir says easily grew to 200 mil with just trading shares a few times between April 21 and mid May. Well, first let's I understand what you mean by easily, right? Like it's very possible. That's I agree. I don't think he would have done it with shares. Just don't see that. And the reason why I don't see that is because from what we've seen so far, he's not decreased",

So my personal opinion again, this I can't justify this other than by what I've been learning by studying the movements by personal opinion is that the movement, the delta between the account value at 38 to 210 is very likely due to options primarily. Now the shares obviously contributed 9 million from the from this point, whatever this point is. But what we can do is his birthday is June 8th. Look at Jimmy share price on his B day in 21. Sure, let's take a look. I don't I honestly don't think that matters whatsoever, but happy to take a look. And I'll explain why I don't think it matters whatsoever. Because again, as I'm looking more and more at his older videos, I'm learning a lot. And it's actually funny because I see somebody who's very, very much verbally processing on these live streams, which is fascinating, right? Because it's not this really refined discrete picture.

So this idea that he's like perfectly timing all of these trades because he has some sort of like magical way to detect this stuff. I genuinely do not see that. And I think that he obviously uses massively heavy leverage. That is the overwhelming contributor to how this has worked out so far for him that I can see clear as day. But the like the way that we're entering and moving around trades is completely different. Renegade says him and R.C. are communicating via tweets. No doubt about it. I think there's a heavy doubt about that. But before we get further, you already know. We got to get uniform appropriate for this part. Because we're talking about some theories now. None of this, none of this can be proven or disproven. These are all straight up theories. But I do not think him and R.C. are communicating at all. And the reason why I think that is because if they do that, the probability of them, if that ever, if one of them either or is investigated for any reason for anything related to this, if there's any sort of communication direct communication",

So I don't think either of them would, would, I don't think either of them would communicate like that. Zacharias says no DMing, tweets and memes, hieroglyphics, sure. I think that they, I think they enjoy trolling for sure. And I think that they like, you know, playing games with one another, because yeah, there's definitely indirect communication. But I would just be super, super clear, because communicating makes it sound like I'm talking to you, right? That's, that's the inference when we use communicate in that context. But I absolutely think that, yeah, for sure, they're probably fucking around with one of them. They're both trolls, right? Like if you look at what they do, they both fucking troll. So of course, that they're going to poke some fun, have fun with one another. That I completely agree with. But all of that would be completely indirect communication.

So I absolutely think that there will be some again, completely indirect, you know, nods, tips of the caps. But like even with something like, you know, tweeting, they're not adding one another. They're not commenting on each other's shit. And I think all of that is very purposeful to keep a healthy delineation between them, which I do think is kind of important. Yeah, because neither one of them are trying to go to fucking jail. I can guarantee you that. Zachary says, but if he's holding that many shares, he could definitely be on the earnings call if he wanted, right? Well, I mean, technically, all of you can anybody that is a shareholder can be on the earnings call. So you just dial in. So yeah, that's like shareholders gain access to the earnings calls inherently. You don't have to be an outsized, outsized trade there. RC's latest tweets equal.

So let's take a look at this. For example, and let's listen. First thing about these, making sure it's at the exact certain time or anything like that. No, no, right. I didn't even mean to click that part, but he's asking like, is this specific time of this meaningful? And he's saying, no, like it's literally not. And he's just like he's just fucking around.

The other thing I noticed when I look at something like Roryn Kitty's communications, I think that when I look at Roryn Kitty's communications as well, they became more cryptic as his popularity gained. And again, I think that's him trolling. I don't necessarily think that's him. He's not trying to hurt anybody, but I think it's him just essentially being able to amplify his personality and play around because even the stuff that we saw in some of the cats early posts, right.

So if we take a step back from this and we go down here, this literally perfect. What's an exit strategy? To do it as a fucking exit strategy, right? Like it's unequivocal. He has a, I literally can see him exit things. And I can see a trend with how he exits some of these things. So he has a fucking exit strategy. He's just trolling. Like he's literally just trolling.

Same reason why he has a picture of these fucking brown shorts. Because he knows when he does stuff like this, people are going to do what this guy's asking him, right? Like does the specific time mean anything? He knows that people are going to do that, which is obviously it's fun, right? To see what people come up with. It's one of the reasons why you have somebody like me who insists on hard data to back ideas, why I enjoy this community so much and learning about all these different fucking string theory ideas, because it's fascinating to see what people come up with. It's not even when I did the podcast with Praveen Bull as I listened to a lot of the stuff you know that he was talking about, that's that's the crazy part about like the tin foil stuff, is that a lot of it is so fucking far out there.

So for example, if I grab X, I think I have, yeah, here we go. I have X here. And if I go to the roaring, not roting, roaring here. So if I go here, don't need the wrong one. We need this one. Here. So if I look at this and I see a few things here, right? So I can clearly see some of these have clear messages. Some of them don't. When I look at something like this, I do believe this is a relatively clear direct message related to Chewie. Once we obviously understand the rest of those pieces. That's what I think. I think this is him getting rid of Chewie. That's I think that is the direct message from this. And I think that because the message is not that deep, it's very easily discipleable, right?

That Lauren says it would be interesting to hear the small bits of info you believe are true from tinfoil theories.

We'll get through the rest of his trades probably this session and one more because I actually want to spend a while looking at the first positions and trying to build it.

Either that or the meanings would be really, really superficial and kind of easy to pick up. But I haven't gone through the meme emoji timeline, just being completely honest.

Again, I don't know. I'm not pretending like I know all this stuff. I don't. But again, the way that I look at it is that if he had a discrete message he wanted to show in some way that people could reasonably arrive to, it wouldn't be completely ambiguous. Sean says he handmade some of the emojis. There you go. So to me, that's the stuff to look at. So the question was the emoji timeline. And my response to the emoji timeline is just saying, I don't think everything in there has a message. That's not me saying nothing does.

I've seen so many ideas with respect to the flag and the microphone. I've seen a million different ideas. If he was trying to communicate something through that specific emoji, I would again, I would have we have to do like an analysis on it. Because part I have imperfect information and I keep reiterating that point here because I do not have all the details. But what I'm looking at with respect to like that specific emoji is I would look at the context of what's around it to try and see if there's what I would consider to be like a reasonably clear meeting. That is the that is the underlying concept I have with respect to indirect communication is the entire the entire idea of indirect communication is to still communicate. It's not to confuse.

And here's another thing that I can tell you definitively from the live streams that I listened to today. He actually talked heavily about how he would be upset with himself for being missized, for being too diluted and too diversified. He literally said that in a stream that I was watching today. So I think over here, like this is survivor ship bias because he did not have some sort of grand timing thesis behind this trade. The timing thesis behind the trade was, I think it's going to go up.

The reason why I disagree with you is because as I look back through his older trades, if you know the dates, your portfolio doesn't go 2,000, 7,000, 22,000, 48,000, 33,000, 46,000. And it doesn't end this period at a low of 17,000, go back up to 40,000, and then go back down to 34,000. So there's not a date here. If somebody knows dates, specific dates that they have supreme high conviction in, you trade the dates only. That's what you would do. Why would I bother maintaining a position here? If I have a date that I maybe know where don't know is going to work? Right? It doesn't, it literally doesn't make sense. It's a logical breakdown in the idea of somebody having specific dates that they're playing. He doesn't have specific dates. I can see it. If he has specific dates, you would not hold something that's up 48 million and take it down to 17 million. You would not do that over the course of two weeks if you have dates.

That's not what I'm suggesting. But what I'm suggesting is looking at the movements here. If somebody had dates, again, date that we think something is going to happen for whatever reason, you don't go through this equity curve. There's no reason to. You make so much more money.

Michael says that three years away is where you learn the dates. I just don't agree with you. If there were some magical dates that he knew and that he was timing, I literally, I literally guarantee you, it would be known by now. I guarantee you, there's not this kind of edge present in markets that are relegated around like this date concept that is not going to be picked up on on the collective intellect. Again, Roy and Kitty is super smart. He is not smarter than everybody looking at this combined. He's just not nobody is Elon Musk is a fucking genius. He's not smarter than the collective intellect of people. That's why he hires really smart people to help him instead of doing it all himself on top of a bandwidth constraint. So the broader idea here, I think, is what I can see from here. We moved a lot. And that's the goal now is I want to see because there's a big gap between these 16 April 21 to two June, right? That's a big gap. It's 1100 days. So now actually what I want to do is reconstruct, like actually construct this portfolio and see if we can come up with ideas on when he started",

So now actually what I want to do is reconstruct, like actually construct this portfolio and see if we can come up with ideas on when he started coming into things and potentially why. So that's the game plan now. So let's go first things first. I want to look at how GME moved over this duration between these. So I want to take a look from 16 April 21. And then I want to look at two June 24. So to do that, I already have those dates from a bar chart export. So I'm going to upload those into our family favorite. I'll probably do. Yeah, I'll start with chat GPT. And then depending on what chat GPT shows me if I believe it or not, then I might look at something else. So I'm throwing into chat GPT and I wanted to do a few things. First things first, analyze the price performance of GME from 17 April 2021, June 2, June 2024. Great. As statistical overview of the price of the price behavior. And then I'll work with that a little bit. Sean says, Arkey showed us he figured something out by using Chewie as another example. I wonder. Yeah, I wonder. The Chewie thing is really, really interesting because it didn't do much like it didn't from his entry point versus his exit",

So if we look, we think he got in on like the 24th of June, I think is when he filed his paperwork, right? It went up 3 less than 3. 2.5. It's really not much. So I think I don't think again here that this was the forecast of some sort of thing. And I do think this was market manipulation. And I'm not admonishing him for that at all. But I think that's what that is there clearly. I think that he knows with him being on the fucking news that what he says is now tracked. And I think it's him playing games. I think it's him trolling a little bit with this whole thing. That's what I think. Because this kind of movement, again, I think he filed what the 13G was for 24 June, something like that. So yeah. Michael, Michael, calm down, bro, chill. We're going to look. Comutets, it's all good. We're going to go through all of it. I know that people get super excited. I share your excitement with you.

So we will check out the 24 to 26 call buys of April when we get there. We will look. But the first thing that I want to look is I literally just want to understand the price performance. Okay. So I'm going to summarize to what chat GPT is telling me. So this is just looking at a statistical overview of price behavior for GameStop between 17 April 21 and 2 June 24. It's 786 trading days. The average price for open is 28. The average high is 29.5. The average low is 27.30 and then the close 28.36 standard deviation for volatility. 12.70 open. High is 13.39. Low is 12. Min. I don't care about those. Let's look at the mediums. So the median opens 24.91. High is 26.01. Low is 24. So very range bound in general. And then the maximum prices open was 75.78. High was 86.17. Low is 72.88. Then close was 75.64. Okay. So that gives us some idea about renegade traders. Those do look at the chart. Forget chat GP. Yo, y'all got a chill. I'm gonna. I'm literally going",

But what I'm doing is I understand when I look at something like a chart, my eyes are going to see certain things based on how my conscious mind is primed. So by conducting an objective statistical analysis of something before looking at it, it helps reset the subconscious priming that's in my mind. And I can get a sense of what average, what mediums actually look like statistically, not what my mind is going to pick up from the charts. Because it is a really, really easy process to have your perception skewed by the thousands of charts you looked at before, the things that you tend to see. I don't want any of that. When I conduct analysis, you will find that I literally go to extreme lengths to curtail my known cognitive biases that I know were there. It's the only way for me to arrive at like truly good information as far as I'm concerned. So that's why I'm doing this. Okay, so that being said, it is now time to look at the chart. So we have",

I want a daily chart. Is that too much to ask for? You have to. It's so annoying. It's all right. It's not that far back so we can make it happen. There we go. There's 21. Okay.

That's the problem with toss is if I want to use toss for this, I have to go back in time, right?

And then if I go back in on demand and do it, it's just super time consuming because I have to fact check the actual data points because I know on demand is unfortunately quite flawed. So yeah, toss would be good, but I also kind of get a kick out of using Yahoo Finance for this. It's like a small homage to Roy and Kitty because he used, I think, whatever the really basic charting thing, which is pretty funny. Off Putin says, demand isn't working for right now for me. Yeah, I think I saw a message yesterday that they're doing maintenance. So I actually am curious if it's going to be any good.

Okay, so let's just kind of get a qualitative assessment of what happened between 16 April 21 and when he came back on to June. So 16 April 21 is a key right here. Now, first question is you know this better than I do, which is why I'm asking you, what was going on in the general space during this period of time? And why did he choose 16 April to leave? Do we know the answers to that? Because I don't know the answers to those. And I'm very interested in what they are if we do know. And the reason why I'm interested in it is a few things. Renegade says can you repeat the questions? Yeah, sorry. Yeah, and let me not do multiple questions. I do that a lot. I've like, yeah, I try to condense too much. The first question is, do we know why he left on 16 April? I think that's the first, the first question I have. And then I'll ask my second question after we get through that first question. Call to testify to Congress. Is that when it happened? So, um, roaring kitty Congress testimony. That was",

Puin says I think the squeeze already slows and his calls expired that day. He didn't know how to value the stock. I don't think that's it. The reason why I don't think that's it is because my estimation is that it has something to do with this in probably legal counsel. He received from his attorneys. That's my guess. So I think the the calls expiring and stuff like that completely agree. I think that's probably why the date lined up. But I think the reason why we didn't see more posts after that is not because of the expiration and not knowing how to value it. I think it had pretty much everything to do with this and the fact that he knew that he was going to have to testify. So that's my best guess. But I don't know.

Yeah. Renegade says he did return early June 21 with the tweet storm. Okay, so let's take a look. Yeah. So then my guess is if he came back with the tweet storm in June of 21, but he wasn't doing yellow updates. I almost have to the overwhelming reason why that would likely be the case is if he was advised by attorneys. That's my guess. So and the reason why he would be advised by attorneys like that is to literally to limit his own risk. That's just de-risk that whole thing. That's my best guess. But let's take a look at the tweet storm. How hard is it? What am I get myself into? How hard is this to go back in time? Oh, this is wait, they're gone. Oh, he deleted stuff. I forgot.

So this one is from April of 2021, which is also interesting because I didn't realize, I thought this was a new one. So he did this thing twice, right? Because he's done this, he's done this before. Okay. Okay. April 9th. So we got to go to the 16th. April 13th, that's pretty close. 14th. Damn, he fucking tweets a lot, bro. 15th. I thought for sure, I would have been past it by now. This is hilarious. 15th again. This is hilarious. Austin Powers. April 15th still. This is nuts. All of this is April 15th. There's the 16th. That's hilarious. There's the 16th. 16th. So it's somewhere right in here. 16th. 16th. Okay. So this is April 16th. So this is the last day that he was tweeting. And let's see what his last tweet was on the last day. That's June 1st. 16th, 5pm. There. So this is where he left right here. And then this is when he came back on the 1st of June in 21. So this tells us, again, I don't think that there's like some sort of really deep hidden meaning here. Right? Like if we if we logically think about this, still don't know.

Like that's exactly what I see here. This is him getting ready to start the game. Off-put and says he's digging up his tools. Yeah, he's just getting back at it. I don't think again, I don't think it's as specific as like getting the tools or getting a specific kind of tool. I literally think again, there's an art to indirect communication. And it rarely is hyper specific unless there's a decent breadcrumb to bring you to that specific thing. So this to me looks like he's returning, right? That's that's what the scene from John Wick was. He was retired. He was not doing the thing anymore. And then this happens and then boom, he's returning. That's what I see here.

Yeah, no, I'm not saying he's not young. I'm just saying it's deceptive, right? Because a lot of people think because he looks, he literally looks like he's in his late teens early 20s, but he's in his late 20s. But he, I mean, he looks super super young. He's aging incredibly well. Okay, so this was the at the market rally back up. Okay. Absolute crater. Wow. Wow. What happened here was this earnings or something else? 29 know.

It looks like it's not jumping out of us. So I'm gonna ask Chachy PT. What news around PME was released on 28 or 29 November 2023? So it looks like something, but I can't, I can't really tell. Like that's a big move. So that's interesting. Um, this is from GPT. It says 28 November 29 saw notable surge in price, 30 24 hours, no specific company news, heavy volumes, speculation around a squeeze, spike, interest, and investors anticipated Q3 earning scheduled for six days. The surge was likely driven by meme stock traders speculating on potential sort squeezes, reminiscing of 2021. Interesting. Interesting thing here is how it kicked off. Again, the one thing I can, I don't speak in absolutes because normally there's a lot of nuance to most things.

Again, do not take the null statement from that. That does not mean every massive expansion in volume means a jump doesn't. Right. So in this case, we went from 1.68 to 7.43 massive expansion in volume, it dumped. But even here, I can see volume from the 24th, 1.2, it goes to 3.7 and then it goes to 14. It is every single time. I've looked at every single gap, every single large moving game stop and it is uniform. Michael says, what do you summarize as to why that might be? Oh, easy because markets are highly informed. That's why I go back to saying that there are no specific dates because if it is, it's going to get arbitraged away nearly immediately. These are people with different kinds of information that are seeing different kinds of movements that are piggybacking and moving off of good movement.

But what we look for is movement that is being driven by institutions of some sort, which is exactly what this is. Michael says, no, all swaps. That's not what it is, dog. I can guarantee you it's not what it is. And the reason why I can guarantee you that that is not all swaps is multiplefold. But I've already regressed the due swaps that have come due from a giant list that the community has built. And there is a non-correlation between when we see big swaps coming due in subsequent price movement. It's not predictive of price movement. And the reason for that, we actually talked a lot about this during the PB episode that I did on Thursday. But you do not know and cannot know what is in a swap. And it's because it is a built derivative between two parties. That derivative is custom made between the two parties. Now there's an exactly as PB pointed out, there's a lot of standardized components to the terms, but the terms still are very personalized to that individual swap. So we cannot discreetly know if big swap is coming due. Does that mean somebody's going to have to go to the market and buy it?",

Probably not because again, it's the same reason why we have dark pools. It's to shroud movement. So why on earth would we have swaps that if they come due that there's going to be the transfer of stock and some component that comes from the market? All literally all entities if that were the case would see it would front run it would skyrocket price before they touched it and then nobody would use swaps ever again because they would get murdered. So that's not it. And it's important again to try and remember like objective analysis because one of the issues I see when a lot of the apes will look at stuff like this, they'll say something like, let's say swaps did come due this day, right? And they'll say something like, well, swaps were due, that's why it moved. And it's again, completely fair idea to start with, but we have to analyze the entire idea. You we can't just look at the instances where it happens to line up. We have to look at all instances of when swaps are due.

And if it's statistically insignificant, it tells me the move is not caused by just the swaps emphasis on just because there could be swaps that come due that necessitate going to the market to purchase shares. It could do I think that that's a high likelihood in severity? No, I don't. And again, it's because there are there is no benefit to the swap if an underlying is going to move. That's the whole purpose of a swap of derivatives is to not deal with the underlying and to deal with this contract pertaining to the underlying. So again, did swaps have anything to do with this? Absolutely could have. I do not know. Was this all swaps that caused this objectively? No, I know that not to be the case. So yeah, something happened here though, very interesting.

But it doesn't let me go back in time. So let's see. It doesn't look at. Damn it. Oh, well, I was curious. That would have been really neat just to see like how much of this was being driven by forever versus other stuff. But yeah, I don't really know. Okay, let's continue. Then we have 24. And then we have the return of the cat. Okay. So now let's start looking at the position and deconstructing. So five million shares at 21274, that literally could have happened a million different ways. Right. So the cliff notes is there were tons and tons of periods where it was trading around those prices. So that could just be stocky accumulation. That could be options exercise. That can be all sorts of stuff. Yeah, all sorts of stuff. Michael says, what would you do with your options experience if you were certain about a date 100",

Let's say I know that this is going to happen here on 28 and 29 November of 23. Let's say I know what's going to happen on the 27th. I'll show you literally exactly what I would do. So we have to go back to 23 November. I have to go to the 27th. And in this case, we're playing the scenario that I know what's going to happen over the next two days. And for whatever reason, I know that there's going to be a big move. Let's use the scenario that I don't know how big the move is going to be. No idea. But I know that there's going to be a big move. So here's the play. We go to the nearest expiration here, the one D's. And we wait for that to load. And let's say that I think it's going to double. I would go out to something like a five delta, wherever there's some liquidity. So maybe these 18s. But if I think it's going to go double, I could go a little further. But let's just",

That's the play. So we analyze that. It's not showing the P and all grap just because it's broken right now. But let's fast forward two days to the 29th. And let's see what we're trading at there. And then let's go to like super early in the morning, 0640. We'll start there. Look like it was higher. Let's go to 0635. Right after the open. Yeah, okay. So in this scenario, let's see where those 18s trade. And I was just going to do it on my phone, but I'll do the math here so that you can see it. I'm not that wrong. I think it's this one. Yeah, cool. We can kill that. I'll just do this. So here we had we got in at a nickel and we had 20,000. And then now they're trading for let's call it 55. Oops, I missed. That's embarrassing in it.

And I'll walk you through exactly why I would do it this way and why I think this way makes the most sense. So when I look at the primary reason for constructing short term is because I can buy more. And the reason for going further out of the money is because they're cheaper and I can buy more. And they have the highest compounding return. Now, depending on how much money I have, there is a scenario where kind of pairing it with in the money options again if I'm not quite certain. But in the case of being certain, that's what it would look like. And it's literally because it's the primary mechanism that trade can make the most money.

I actually did this with Newton and we have a pretty good idea. Now, Michael says it was a bit of a rhetorical question, but that's my point is humor me. It doesn't matter, right? Because again, like let's let's we're going to do that again, but because you are incessant, I will grant because now we're on this part, we can talk about it. Right? So let's look at where the movement was in GameStop. Austin says, I think Michael wants you to check those April calls. I'm not sure either. Actually, great point, Austin. Michael, could you do us a favor and confirm real quick if we're supposed to look at those April calls or not? Because for the calls that were entered in April, because it's right now based on our best guesses, it's inconclusive. And we're really uncertain is to whether or not that's what we want to happen.

So because new and I completely deconstructed literally all of these trades. Yeah. So we know what these are. But anyways, let's just talk about the theory of knowing a date. Now, let's say we know the date is somewhere between mid April, April, you know, 13 April, it looks like and then it comes back down the 17th, right? If I know a date and I know the date starting back here, when the stock is trading in late April, again, let's say that you're saying the 24 to 26. So let's go back to the midpoint there, just for the example, let's go to April 25th. And let's say I know those dates, right? Those dates are going to be sometime between May, 13th and 17th, right?

We're moving on to the reserve mango orange. So you know, it's getting real. Let's take a look. So again, I know that that date is going to be mid May. Let's check out the options. The first thing that I don't do is go to June. Because if I know the date is May, I go to 17 May options. And that's not saying that I know the specific date. The reason why I go to 17 May is because it's the closest primary expiration that I can build a position in. But what I can guarantee you is that if I know dates, I'm not going to go out to June. So if we take a look at his position, he is 21 June, 24, 20 calls. That's out here. Not here. That's the first thing. The second thing is I wouldn't bother with the 20s. And I would go further. Even the 25s. There's still plenty liquid. But there are a lower delta. And again, they're going to give me a higher compounding capability. Royntady says maybe...

Yeah, there's no debate there. What I'm trying to explain to you is that if I have a date and I think that there's going to be a big movement for whatever reason in mid-May, I do not go to June. I go to May. I think I don't know if that part's connecting with you or not. But it doesn't matter when he enter. I'm using 25 April. I'm using the window you're giving me.

Okay, so Michael show me where yeah, I'll go here show me where he bought up the chain. Again, I don't care if you show me and don't show me line items for 5,000 contract buys.

Again, let's take a look on a trade. I traded GameStop during this. So fun fact, some of the activity that depending on what periods we look at is me. And the reason why I highlight that is because if I'm seeing the activity, literally everybody in Jesus sees the activity. But the first thing I want to show you is this.

Specifically that we can clearly identify as anything. It just, it like, nothing, it doesn't make sense. And again, I'm not saying that he couldn't have done any of that. We know that he traded some of those. No doubt. But what I can tell you is that when we see Rory and Kitty starting to get into his options, the size makes sense for the portfolio. So the main issue that I take with the overall argument, even if he knows the dates and all that stuff taken that for granted, he's not going to put on a fucking options position on a 34. Again, that's that's even saying in we're taking it as here that when he exited 34 million dollars of a portfolio, he's not going to put 500,000 into a trade. It literally doesn't even make sense. It's such a trivial amount of money for somebody like that. It literally doesn't make sense. So granting all the other points that we cannot, we literally cannot verify, we cannot verify. And that is what it is. We cannot verify. We can",

It's okay to have ideas, but but this doesn't line up at all. So Cedric has the real question and I agree with the real question, which is where did 200 million come from? And we don't know. Newton and I spent a lot of time analyzing that exact thing, trying to come up with best guesses whose Newton's idea was that he traded from the 34 to the 210. And I don't see that personally, I genuinely don't. So the reason why I don't see it is because I think Cedric says, how else if he didn't trade? Oh, sorry, let me be, let me be super, super clear.

He wasn't in it, but my guess is I don't know if he received any sort of money for that, but if he did, it probably would have been a non-inconsequential amount of money. So I don't think, yeah, I don't think he did all of this in GameStop. That's all I mean. I don't know whether or not he used other accounts. I think, yeah, I think in general, will he says maybe he got outside investing? I don't think so. Like I don't see why he would take that, right? Like, because let's think of it from a general mortal standpoint. Like why would I bother taking any money from anybody in owing anybody anything if I have 34 million? Like that's still more money than a reasonable person could, could spend, right? Like, yes, it's easy to spend 34 million. This is not hard at all.

Yeah, I mean, you can, the other thing I can do to debunk the idea like super fast is, again, like if he figured out the dates somehow and like May was the first time he knew the dates and we think that that was him, the subsequent move didn't happen 21 June, right? So if we take a look at this move that happened in here, this isn't 21 June. So it peaked seven June. So again, like the timing thing doesn't line up at all because he bought calls in this again, granting that he knew the date in May. He didn't post in May. He came back. He traded this perfectly. Again, granting because he knew the dates. What I can show you is that he bought options for 21 June here, which again, like if I knew that, if I knew the date was going to be in here, I wouldn't buy options out here.

Like literally from the point that we have no confirmation who is who we clearly see a completely missized position from his last update at 34 million dollars. There's no way that you're trading 100,000 worth of options. It's just or 500,000 worth of options. Like you're going to come back so much heavier than that, which he did in the June play. Like we can just look at it as a percentage of the portfolio. How much he's comfortable putting into options throughout the entire life cycle. It just doesn't make sense at all, so yeah. That's that back to this analysis, though. We got to grab this. We got to grab this. Michael says his first tweet back was after hitting the May play.

Again, I'm granting the entire thing that he timed all this because he knew dates. But I'm using that exact point you're making in highlighting that he didn't do that. Because when he posted, again, for this update thing, he posted at a point where GameStop was trading what is trading in here. So he posted over the weekend here, I guess, for that two June or whenever he came back. But the options that he had in two June were out to 21 June. Right? Like if he knew the dates were this, he wouldn't have gone out that far. He would have gone closer. So again, it just doesn't make sense. So yeah. Okay, back to this. All right.

I mean, he did like he has done that right. We can we literally can see it. So part of me I see it as. Oh, that's funny.

Because you can notice in my argument with Michael when we were debating. I granted his points, right? Like I took his side and then I still worked through the scenario. Not once has that been reciprocated by him and that's again like very, very common for somebody that's not actually trying to identify truth.

And this is going to take. Not too long. So these came in mid May. Off Putin says 19 to 29. Thank you very much. That's super helpful. I mean, we can kind of see it anyways, but yeah. And when he showed up, it was 120,000. Because this is nowhere near 120,000. So we have to figure out when this thing got built, which is going to be a little bit of a tricky prospect, but we will navigate through it. So now what I need to do is add another tab. And this will be RK. What is this? The 21 June. 20s. And let's take a look. So this is going to be date. This is going to be time. I want both of those specifically in this instance. This is going to be size. This will be. It's all the same. I'm going to keep it the same up here. This will be the 21 June 20 calls. All of these will be for that. Okay. And then.

Well, not not any more convenient than this. It's essentially the same same. Okay. So now let's start looking at these dates. I wish there was like a dual sort here. That would be. Much more preferable. We start on the 20th is the earliest that I see. So 20 May. I find that when we do these like people have a really hard time. Like doing the process, which is always interesting to me. Because this is like this is the process of research. Is actually getting into the details. Not using the easily accessible. Submation level information. I need a custom date. I don't like these dates. Here we go. So let's do those. Yeah, good. Okay. Beautiful. And then Michael says other than you're not getting into the details. I thought you were leaving. Didn't you tell us you were going off you little rascal. Because it looks like you're still here.

Yeah, that's actually a great point he could have. And one of the other things is and we'll take a look at it in a second. But one of the other things here is like even the duration on these is still pretty significant. I would argue compared to like doing something that's like super, super short term timeframe. So if we look at what is this 21 June. I already have it up here. Let's just take a look. 21 June 24 equals this minus this. Yeah, so it's still a month out, even from here. So it's not like it's a very short dated option. That's still a pretty meaningful amount of time. So it's 20 May. Now let's take a look at 21 May. And again, I'm not going to try to figure out where you got all his options. I'm just trying to get a couple of senses of things really quick. 21 May is 12 57 25, 5,000 again.

I'm an idiot. I'm a straight idiot. They're literally right next to each other. Man, I'm stupid. I can't believe y'all let me get away with that 20 May. And he got those at 12 49. 49 16. Now, one of the other kind of Adam Admin notes is. We assume essentially all of these are him. But again, like we genuinely don't know. Because the overall options chain here was actually pretty active. So there's a good chance that other people were because again, I saw the activity. That's one of the reasons why I started trading GameStop. Like quite literally right around this period is because I saw the options chain being hit. Literally this, which was absolutely insane. So I ended up starting buying into it straight up for that precise reason. So as I was doing that, I know for sure other people were doing it. Because if I see it, I know other people see it. 21 May.

But again, I just I'm very cautious for definitive statements like most was Gil. And we don't know that. But we do, we can confirm that he was a large constituent, probably most, I think is completely fair to say. 21, 21 May again. These came in at 1249 31 1249 31. And then 2.48.

I don't know if I haven't gone through all of the 120's, but I know that the OI is larger than that during the period. So if we go to what 10 May. 10 May 24.

It's actually like precisely what I did the piece together the total thing. I. I like it's I mean, it sounds weird, but it is what it is. Like I like being intimate with the data. So my preference for something like this. If you take a look at like the series, right? It's analyzing Rory Kitty's trades. So I am trying to like quite literally analyze them. So the process of analyzing is very in depth for me. But I do it so that I understand all of the nuance around what happened. That's my that's my goal. It's why we why I've gone through piece by piece. So it's much slower. This is not something that I do in general for most things I'm looking at.

For most professional traders that's a very common time to put on larger positions because there's a lot of liquidity. But I can still see that he's splitting it a little bit and there are some prospecting positions that are going on through different points throughout the day. 11 32 33 oops. Don't need to fucking up my data. And that was 3.13. All Putin says don't forget fees and commissions. Yeah, I don't think they'll have commissions here. But yeah, you're absolutely right. It's super expensive. We did. We did an analysis on this not too long ago. Looking at. You know, the prospects of some of his other positions, whether taking to expiration or unwinding.

It's 11 25 that he's entering, which again is like exactly what I would expect to see here. Very, very standard fair. And",

Which looks like. Something around here. Which is totally legit. I'm going to see what GPT right now GPT is giving me nothing. So we'll see if there goes. That's not what I wanted at all. The 28th. Okay. So that average premium. I'm just going to verify if chat GPT is correct. 2.81. It is good. So I got that right. This is what it's showing average premium portrayed by day. So obviously this is an aggregate is not aggregate premium. Because I noticed that yeah, there was a couple bigger trades here. So then the last thing I'm going to dump in here really fast is. Jimmy price. Which I haven't here. And then I just realized it's almost fucking eight o'clock. So I got to get off in a second. Damn, three hours. I didn't even realize it's been that long. Okay, so we need 20 May. Which is 2314. We need 21 May. 2212. 22 May. 2112. Interesting. 24 May. 19. But definitely scaling. 28 May. 23. 78. 30 May. 2261. Very interesting. So a couple of things that stick out to me",

But definitely scaling. 28 May. 23. 78. 30 May. 2261. Very interesting. So a couple of things that stick out to me about this are again, like going back to this concept of him somehow having like perfect timing. So scaling also disproves that to me. Because I wouldn't time it where I'm essentially placing. Let me have this add. Total premium. At total. Premium. Birthday and. Emulative premium. Do the second. But the scaling in is is really, really interesting. Yeah. I like this chart. So I'm going to do add a second axis. For average premium per day to preserve. Scale. Also add. GME price. 20 May. 2314. 21 May. 2212. 22 May. 2112. 24 May. 19. 23. 2378. And then 30 May. 2261. 2261. Okay. I'm going to see if it can make these updates. And then. Is what I want to know. Specifically. Yeah, there we go. So this is obviously looking at a few things. So. This is interesting. I need to understand this better. One of the parts that I don't understand from this. I'm going to say. Is. Why. Why the scaling that he did. Like 20 May. 21 May. Like two very light days. Followed by this massive bulk day. And then. A handful more. Because the other thing I can infer from this",

It actually almost looks like he planned to get to 100. What does this add up to. 25. No, I don't think he would have done 95. That's kind of weird. That's really interesting. And the reason why it's so interesting to me is like the periods that he bought in. What the stock was doing. Makes sense because I've seen him do this plenty of times before. Where he scales into things as they go down. That's not new at all. But I wonder like what the terminal position size was expected to be. Is that I'm not sure. If that was defined, it doesn't look like it was defined to me. Fascinating. Man. Fucking cool. All right, I have to noodle on this a little bit more, but I got to get off.
