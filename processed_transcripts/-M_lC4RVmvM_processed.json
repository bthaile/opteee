    "text": "two big problems with the wheel options strategy it's actually a big part of what I do slight variation because I like to trade the coverage strangle and there's a specific reason for that it actually helps address some of these problems but I want to walk you through what these two problems are why you should care about them and then how we can overcome them because I actually think the wheel or the coverage strangle are two fantastic strategies for just about all Traders especially newer Traders but some of these get in the way and they give people a bad experience because they're not really thinking through the strategies in their entirety what's up everybody Eric here welcome back to all the outliers let's start talking about the wheel okay the very first problem I am comfortable getting assigned at x x meaning a price on a specific stock I literally cannot tell you how often I have heard this sentiment we have something that's trading along just like this that you see here and they're making this statement when things look like this meaning they look good the underlying is going generally where we want it to there's good earnings supporting it everything seems good so for most people they come up with this just insane mental gymnastic where oh if it's trading at 180 up here I would love to have it at 160. it's a bargain the problem with that sentiment is this when",
