You can actually start off doing things in a slightly more optimized manner based on what you're seeing. This is something that I do. And I've been doing this for a long time now. The reason why I do that is because markets continue to evolve. The second that you think as a trader that like you got it all dialed in, you already know what's going to happen. It's all, you know, known goods, not like it literally is not. I actually just made a really long post on Reddit compiling some of my other posts so that it's a little bit of a reference. That's the point. And as I was writing a part of it, I was reminded of a really, really important piece. The piece that I was reminded of is the fact that even though I've been trading for 17 years now, I've only experienced three bear markets in of those three bear markets. Two of them have been in the last four years. So it's kind of an interesting statistic, whatever you want to call it. It's an interesting thing to me because with that context, it lets you know that this world that we're in of trading can be very path dependent, whatever",

It's an interesting thing to me because with that context, it lets you know that this world that we're in of trading can be very path dependent, whatever something happens to show you at a given point in time. And for me, obviously a big part of what it showed me was a really prolonged bull market. And people might mistakenly immediately think that that's like all good and great. And wow, that must have been a great starting point. And it kind of isn't the reason why everything has its series of problems. And that's another thing that I highlighted in the post that I made is for somebody like me, I absolutely have grown up with very much of a resource constrained mindset. And that impacts me in a lot of different ways. Now taking that back to the idea of path dependency and whatnot, we all are going to face a series of challenges based on our individual circumstances. They all look a little bit different. So there's going to be some traders that maybe came from a less scarce environment that are more and maybe too risk open. If we take a look at trading, maybe we have traders that just started trading during 2020 when the Stimmi checks came out and they have their perception of what things look like.

If we take a look at trading, maybe we have traders that just started trading during 2020 when the Stimmi checks came out and they have their perception of what things look like. The important thing to understand is that there is an element of path dependence around the time that you happen to begin trading, doing whatever you're doing. You have to be aware of that. So going through a review process is non-negotiable. Because even if you do this for a long time, there's a really solid chance that things are going to continue and move and evolve. And unless you can successfully make that journey with it, you fall behind. And you start making mistakes, you start drawing down, you start losing money, you don't want to lose. So that is, that's actually I think a pretty solid intro for today. So this is interesting with the tariffs. I actually hadn't been looking at this. What did you guys learn about tariffs here? Oh, look at that. That's hilarious. I love that he has that. When Trump is running for president in 2016, said he might consider to, okay, then we can pause that. Now, the session for today is a little bit of a reboot from the session yesterday, which is actually kind of a good thing, I think, because we might be able to move through in a more condensed manner.",

Now, the session for today is a little bit of a reboot from the session yesterday, which is actually kind of a good thing, I think, because we might be able to move through in a more condensed manner. Because when I'm doing these live streams, I never, I literally never know what direction we're going to go or we're going to talk about. So it's not obviously a fully polished refined thing. It's something that we're talking about live. That's the concept of a live stream for those that are curious about that. So we did a video yesterday and we actually spent a little bit of time talking about priorities for a trader. And that's what I want to talk about today. And you might be saying Eric, if you just said we talked about that yesterday, why are we going to talk about it today? And that's actually a fantastic question. It's a great question to ask because it seems redundant, which I have to agree with you. It does feel slightly redundant. Alas, the video that we did yesterday is gone, dead and gone. The reason why it's dead and gone is because we had literally a, I'm not even kidding, a 28 second clip of a TED talk about quantum computing, 28 second clip. And in that 28 second clip, they decided to strike the video. So the video is dead. The funny part",

The funny part about that, by the way, is a lot of times when you have a copyright infringement, what they'll do is they'll let the video stay up and then they just take the ad revenue, which is always a little annoying anyways because it's like, well, if you do a video that's, I think that video was like two hours long. And it's two hours of unique personal stuff about whatever we're talking about. But if there's this 30 second component, then they then get all of the ad revenue for it, which is a little confounding to me the way that that works. But they didn't even do that. They literally just removed it. So that's why every time we start the videos and people are like, yo, there's no sound. Yo, there's no sound. I know, dog. I know there's no sound, which is hilarious. Trace says, hey, hey, this may be the second time they've done this, they shut it down midstream, which was rude. That is true because the mid I, and that was for, I distinctly remember that one too.

Yeah, I, the thing with fair use is very strange because I do think that that video technically would be fine under fair use. I actually appealed it, but they have 30 days on the appeal because it goes to whoever the creator was. So I, because I think what ends up happening is they will, they see the clip somehow, the YouTube algorithm super smart will detect the overlap, and it's normally by the volume. That's why this other way works for now. And my guess is they just get a bunch of them, and they probably just copyright all of them by default without looking at it. So you have to like go through an appeal process. Now, I think for bigger creators, what they can do to avoid that is like, preemptively reach out and try to talk to them about it or something, but I'm still on the peasant world.

So I thought we would begin with a recap of this priorities for a trader discussion that we had yesterday. So let me grab our little drawing pad. And I am actually hopeful that we can talk about this in a slightly different way since we did just talk about it yesterday. I'm going to go through the general artifacts that I think belong here. But I think people probably have had a little bit of time now to digest specifically if you were on the live stream, if you weren't on the live stream, then yeah, you'll just have no idea what we're talking about, which is good. This will be a first of its kind for you. So we had a conversation about the priorities of a trader. And if we look at the world of a trader, it starts first with goals. The reason, if you're called, why it starts with goals is because literally everything else we do is going to be reverse engineered from this. So this needs to be specific. We need a very, very specific thing that we're trying to do. It needs to be measurable without something",

    "text": "The reason, if you're called, why it starts with goals is because literally everything else we do is going to be reverse engineered from this. So this needs to be specific. We need a very, very specific thing that we're trying to do. It needs to be measurable without something that's measurable. We are shooting at a highly nebulous target. It's kind of a waste of time. It does need to be achievable. It needs to be realistic within the bounds of where you're at. And I normally skip the R of a smart goal. I think it's like relevant or I think it's I think the R is relevant. But I don't really do smacks. I just think it's an extra word so that they can make the word smart. I think that that's whatever the R is based on what I looked at it before. I think it's covered in this, which is time bound. So when we think of our goals a lot of times we start with really superficial ideas. We start with I want to be rich. I want to make a lot of money. One of the things I work with a lot of people in the mentoring program, which is really interesting to me because it shows the detachment. That's actually one of my favorite things that I have the opportunity to do with the Patreon side of things is I get a chance to like really get much closer to retail traders",

That's actually one of my favorite things that I have the opportunity to do with the Patreon side of things is I get a chance to like really get much closer to retail traders to understand different perspectives and how we think about things. And it literally helps me inform everything else that I do because I am full will aware that the way I do things is very different than the way a lot of other people will do things. I am again, I'm aware of that. So a lot of the things that I would say or do or prefer doesn't inherently apply to anybody else. So it lets me tailor things more specifically. So taking it back to the point I was making when we look at the goals I'll normally say something like what's your goal? And the goal almost looks the same slight variations. The goal will be I want to replace my income. I want to retire in 15 years. I want to have, it's actually rarely a certain amount of money. Most people don't say a certain amount of money. It's normally one of those first two definitely. And then what would I say the third most common might be? I don't think it would be like make money. I don't think it would be reduced risk.

I don't think it would be reduced risk. I honestly think the overwhelming majority of responses fall into one of those first two buckets. So that matters because if you think about those goals they're fine. And here's an important note that you have to take on board early with your priorities. You do not need a perfect goal to start. As we talk about these priorities and as we talk about literally everything you do as a trader what I want you to always keep in mind is an 80 solution now. Is better than 100 solution later. Now there will be certain things that this doesn't apply to. If we're talking about stuff that's like very, very, very high on what we would call a racey matrix in the Marine Corps. And I think other services use different versions of that too. It's just a way to evaluate risk. But if we have something that's very high severity meaning if you fuck this up the severity is massive then that deserves better than this 80 now. Especially if you have the luxury of time. But the premise behind 80 solution now is greater than 100 later is really to get people out of their own way. And I'll give you an exact example. My original goal",

My original goal as a trader was to be a millionaire before 30. That was my original goal. And guess what? Moving in the correct direction is plenty fine. If that as a goal got me moving in the correct direction. It wasn't a perfect goal. I was actually one I needed to revise a couple times. But that's what started me off. So what I'm trying to highlight is you don't need a perfect goal to start. Pick something that generally starts moving you in the correct direction and then refine it as you go. Now if you're further along and you're because that that's I'm talking about 17 year old I don't even know how old I was. I'm never good with ages. I was always curious about this. My dad before he died. I used to ask him when I was a kid like how old you are. And he would literally say I don't know. And that was the most strange thing to me.

In your in your genuine opinion and then I'm going back into my videos really quick to grab the video about setting goals. This video.

And to broaden Lizzy's point, there's more nuance to this. Because if we want to replace our income, that stands for year zero. That stands for the year that we're going to try to replace our income. So if you have 100,000, as our salary or whatever, that means that we would probably need to earn through trading like 125 or something like that, depending on how the rest of this shit looks. So this could be fine to start. The problem is that if you're 35, is this the same amount of money that you want to live off of for the next 50 years? Maybe it could be. And this could be completely fine. You might even say I need less than this. That's great. The point though is that it should be considered. And most people don't consider it. This is because most people are trying to solve the problem that's right in front of them. And they're not thinking more deeply about what they're doing.

You're thinking about only your foot being on fire. Now, as an example, this is kind of a fun example that's just like this is actually kind of fun. Like thinking of random stuff in my brain. The equivalent of this example is if your foot is on fire in your solution for your foot being on fire is to jump into this vat of whatever to put the fire out. So this is your solution. You're going to jump in this vat. The problem is when you jump in the vat, it's fucking acid. And then your face melts off like this. So even though there's a big problem upfront that we have to solve for, we are too focused on this immediate problem.

And we become over focused on this empty problem on this upfront problem that we're not considering the solutions around us. So this just looks like better choice. I'm going to jump in here to be put out. But it's fucking acid. And now I'm melting my skin is bubbling and falling off. That's worse than this. It's actually worse than this. This is a little bit extreme, obviously. It's kind of a, I don't know why my brain is like this, but it is. This is just the example I thought of. And but that is the equivalent of this because you can become so myopic on trying to replace your income here that you fail to think about this 50 year timeframe. And then you can do everything in your power to build a system that allows you to hit this. You could build a system that checks this box for you. But it comes at the price of building something that's more robust, scalable, and actually serves you better in the long run. So maybe rather than jumping into the vat of acid, you run outside where there's a hose and you put your foot out. Here's the downside to that. By the time you get out there, you're going to have some burns. You're going to have some third degree burns. You're going to",

By the time you get out there, you're going to have some burns. You're going to have some third degree burns. You're going to absolutely have an affliction by the time you get there. But I would argue third degree burns on your leg is still preferable to jumping into acid. This is bad. This is a bad life choice almost always. And Joey brings up a great point because if there's an open vat of acid, you might want to check what's coming out of the hose before you start squirting your leg with it. Maybe you have a friend nearby and you know, just give them a little squirt, something like that. Make sure that you're good. This is a really great point, Joey, by the way. But the main thing is a little bit of near term pain and acceptance might be a better solution ultimately. That's the same thing here. We don't want to get so stuck on solving this upfront problem that we then forego thinking about potential future problems that we just hadn't considered yet because they're still there. And this is what most people do. And again, I've had quite a few people in the mentoring program. And this is a very common thing because this is still a much better starting point than what a lot",

We talked about things like selling a listed substances, substances. We talked about things like selling the flesh of your body. You do have spare body parts like extra kidneys. Those can be offloaded. You don't really need it. I don't know if there's really a market for one of those things, tonsils, the things in the back year throat. I don't know if there's a market for those, but you got those people get them out all the time. Same thing with the dangly thing. No, the epiglottis is the flap. I don't know what the dang is.

You can't save your way to wealth. Reese lets me know it's called a uvula. Great. Thank you. That's for everybody that is wondering. Same as I dangly think uvula. So maybe you can sell your uvula. But you can't save your way to wealth because you can only cut so much. And in this example, you can only cut so much off or out. So now we need to start coming up with some other ideas on how we can hit this. And you can think of a bunch of different ways. This step is very basic.

And you might say, okay, day trading, it seems like you can make some money doing that. But then you realize that you work a full time job and you can't get to your phone during most of the day. Okay, well, day trading is viable, but it's not applicable to you. It's just not something that fits in your scenario. So we can ask day trading off this list because we know the general profit mechanism from day trading is being in front of the screen most of the day trying to trade intraday price fluctuations and so on and so forth.

I don't know anything about market making. I don't know anything about value investing. This means you need to spend a little bit of time learning about these. And if you're a new trader in this section here between goals and brainstorm, I would literally read options as a strategic investment. I would read volatility pricing, volatility in pricing by Nate and Berg. And then I would read positional options trading by you and Sinclair. This is for a brand new trader. These three books. And I think these three books are highly applicable for a brand new specifically options trader because these cover a lot of bases and they also give you a very natural sense of a progression for yourself because you're going to need to track questions and build the syllabus. Now we talked about this in passing yesterday as part of some of these other steps. I'm adding it as a distinct step here because I do think continually creating a focused learning path designed to answer questions that are specific in setting specific time, frequency and topics for our learning sessions.

    "text": "this in passing yesterday as part of some of these other steps. I'm adding it as a distinct step here because I do think continually creating a focused learning path designed to answer questions that are specific in setting specific time, frequency and topics for our learning sessions. And again, I would literally pretend whatever entity, whatever thing that you might make a, whatever entity or thing that you might make an appointment with that in your mind and your world, there's a zero percent chance than that you would ever miss the appointment. That's what needs to happen here. Very, very specific process. Lizzie says this is better than yesterday. Well, that's good to know that you thought the time I spent yesterday was straight trash in a waste of everybody's time. So that makes me feel good. Lizzie, I appreciate that feedback. And maybe it's good then that that video got copyright struck because obviously the the effort that I put into it was worthless. It's just good to know. I'll take that to heart. And when I'm sitting at dinner or something later, maybe I won't eat because I might think that I won't be worthy of eating at that point. I think that would be fair because it feels like in order to eat a meal, you have to be worthy, right? Like you have to put some work in. You have to have some sort of output. So Lizzie's essentially told me not to eat",

So really, really appreciate the feedback Lizzie on that. And yeah, yeah, just just for everybody's awareness. Just don't watch the video yesterday because Lizzie said that it's a giant piece of trash. So, um, message is received. Lizzie, thank you. Very clear. By the way, um, so now we have our first four steps. Are there any specific questions on these four steps? These four steps are your without a doubt, the straight priority. And it's in this order. It's literally as simple as it gets. Now again, simple doesn't mean easy. They're different. But that's all there is to it. These are your first steps without a doubt. And what I try to remind people is for anybody that is going through this process, trying to figure out their priorities. And this is what I offer for the folks that are in the mentoring program.

You don't have to have a perfect roadmap in place, but you need something that's generally going to move you in the correct direction. So these are your first four steps. Now, let's fast forward and let's say that we're moving through these pretty quick. Let's say that you have your goals.

So again, another great example is maybe you're trying to trade a momentum. Let's say you have a 10,000 account. And you're trying to trade based on the momentum research that you looked at SSRN because you're studious and enterprising and you're going to leverage existing research to come up with your ideas as you should.

So then you might look at what you might be able to do in terms of buying stock with your 10,000 account. But if you have 15 holdings and you have a 10,000 account, you really can't put on big positions. So you might say, well, buying stock might work. It might be the simplest, but this might not work for me because I need a little bit of leverage for more capital efficiency. So maybe we start favoring something like buying calls. That's an eyeball test. You could do that in seconds. Doesn't take a lot of effort. So then once we complete the eyeball test, we pick the top performers. And this doesn't have to be the top one. This could be like the top one to three, whatever you want. And now is where we do the work. Now is where we go through the effort of building the strategy. This is where we test all of the different permutations that we think might apply. This is where we tinker with buying the calls that are 10 days, 20 days, 50 days, 100 days, 200 days,",

So especially with my mouse. S strategy outlines. There we go. Got it. Got it out. That's literally a comprehensive list of priorities for a new trader. So first things first, let me know if you have questions on any of this stuff. A travel Ursula says, I don't know where this fits in, but there's also the trader's psychology. Some strategies when he tried, you may work, but are not for you because you're personality in mind. It's a great point. And it's also a really delicate dance because some of it is finding things that align well with you, which is exactly what this process will identify. But the other part of it is getting your brain to adapt to be more successful in interfacing with different things. So I have two videos that I need to share with you.

There's actually another one that I have coming out in a couple weeks. And then as always, Shrej is doing the Lord's work. And giving me an excuse to plug my paper trading video that has a resounding 460 views. I love that. So it's literally a classic, absolutely classic scenario. It is hilarious. So how do we feel about that? And this was originally from Lauren and Lizzy. And I really do want to make sure that you both are comfortable now that we've had a couple times to talk about priorities. And I actually think what would be really great for both of you, because I think both of you are in the Patreon if I'm not mistaken. So you both should dump it in the Discord if you can. Dump it in the Discord now. And we literally can take a look at it together on the way that I would think of it. And for those that would like as well, you can drop it",

Let's say I'm running a strategy. Harvey says is it unique close heat tech? No, I don't buy anything specifically for heat at all. I'm so warm. Naturally, there's a 0 chance I would buy specifically something designed to keep you warm. I actually think this is literally I think it's like it's sheer. I don't know if you guys could see through. I could see through it pretty easily. Like very, very sheer, but it's still somehow very warm. But let's fuck I forgot I literally got completely sidetracked. The fuck was I just saying? I was talking about some sort of example priorities trading plan. Perfect. So let's say you're building a strategy outline. And again, that trading plan video goes through all of this, but you're going to write your executive summary.

There's so much information that you could easily get completely caught up in just looking at random shit that may or may not matter. And that's why going through this process is so important because this process is literally what gives you the shit that is important for you to focus on. Gotta get done. So and this is why as a trader, you have to be a thinking adaptable being because the problem sets that you face are going to continue to evolve. And if you can't autonomously adapt to solve for different problems, you're going to have big fucking problems because trading is going to continue to move and evolve at a rate that literally forces you to keep up and figure it out or straight up get left behind. And if you're trying to do this for a living, we do not want to get left behind. So that is my approach to managing priorities as a trader. It's that whole section summarizes to create goals, create a learning plan based on you filling out your trading plan strategy outlines, and then be very specific about what you're trying to learn and when be intentional is the idea. Lizzie says my goals are in the discord. Perfect. Let me go grab those so that we can look at them together. I'm going",

It's definitely primarily video games and stuff for sure, but there is a small finance presence on there. The main reason why I'm even trying the dual stream thing is because especially for the people that would be on Twitch, I am hopeful that some of them will randomly stumble across this stuff because most of those people are going to be at the age that this stuff is really fucking impactful. That's my thought, but I could be completely wrong, but that is my guess. All right, let's see what Mel wants for dinner. All right. All right. Joseph, how is pizza last night? I was fucking trash, bro. It was not good. Crash is a little dramatic, but it definitely was not good. Like, would not order from there again. Okay. Let's see what Liz's priorities are. New setup, large monitor, rearrange scheduling, start 15 a day, what goes in there? Okay. So here is the important thing. This stuff doesn't matter. The setup doesn't matter. This is stuff that's already done, which is good. Rear range scheduling, I imagine, has to do with creating time, which is good.

We don't need to say that we're going to keep doing it because you need to do it. It's there already. We already have this. So for week two, this is where we need to define our priority for the week.

So the AAR process after action review is exactly what it sounds like. It's where we look through what we did and how we did. So for example, the out the AAR process for the one month is going to be all about this. Have I researched whatever I'm supposed to research?

On a weekly basis, this is where we're tracking our progress towards that one month objective, which then feeds into your six month objective, which then feeds into your 12 month objective. So to tie all that together for you, if our 12 month objective is to make 10 profit in a year, that means that we need to have trading plans and strategies that have the potential to yield 10 profit per year. Do we have that? The one month objective might be research one approach that can move me towards 10 per year, whatever that is.

Travel says I have a question on strangles. Yeah, of course, let's do it. The rest of the sessions and I just kind of an open conversation, an open dialogue about whatever we want. Maybe we can go over the post that I made in Reddit. I think there might be some some good stuff in there. Lizzie says yes, it didn't happen last night. Yeah, because they took the fucking thing down. They nuke the stream. But it normally doesn't, I don't think it happens that fast anyways, especially for longer videos. I don't think it's like an instantaneous thing. I don't know how long it takes, but it takes a little while. Bull says, what's your Reddit username? Genuinely, I have no idea. I literally don't even know how to see that. I'll see if I can figure it out though. But for travel, let me know what the what the strangle question is. Happy to take a look. Joseph, I think the trick is to not let it play longer than 30 seconds without talking over pausing it. Yeah, well, that falls into fair use, but it's not, it's not defined because the video from last night, I literally looked at it as 28 seconds. So it's not even, it's not 30 seconds unfortunately.

But the homework that I've done on fair use is that it's, it's actually not limited to any specific time frame. I think they look at it subjectively, but part of it would be the total time frame relative to the total length of the video. But my guess is again, for bigger channels like that, they probably just see a smaller channel like mine. And I'm imagining that they get the alert and they're just like, yeah, fuck that. Like I don't think that they're actually looking over it to see like, do I think that this is good or not? That's my guess at least. I don't actually know from a practical standpoint. So yeah. Okay, so travel says, so imagine one month out, one put one call, the put is at 50 so want to close. So not just call. So then what? Let me see if I'm understanding your question. So in this scenario that you're outlining, you're saying that we have a short strangle that's 30 days. And I'm assuming you mean sold to open. So we sell to open a strangle. The put is at 50 of max profit. So if we have we sold",

Let's do this scenario where the calls worth more. Let's say the calls worth like a dollar 25 or something like that. And you want to close. So what you can do is you can buy to close this for 50 cents. That means that you're going to realize your PNL of 50 bucks on the short put side. And then you're going to have the short call side that still remains. So the question of try to get another put for the same expiration. That comes all the way back to whatever strategy you're trying to do. This sounds like you're trying to break the strangle apart into different pieces, which is okay. It's viable.

But the question I have is just like what's the plan here? What are we trying to do with this strategy as a whole? Because it sounds like you're trying to arbitrarily apply the tasty trade methodology of like 50 max profit or something. In this case, I'm speculating I'm guessing. But that's my guess is that you're you saw something from tasty trade about 50 max profit. So I think you're just trying to apply that in the circumstance, which is an okay starting point. But I think it's a little bit nebulous because say for example, the trade has passed a week and your put is showing of 50 profit on it. It might be exactly where you want it to be now. So there might not be a reason to take the trade down as doing exactly what you want. The trade is doing exactly what you want. You might want to move the put to rebalance your deltas if that's part of it. Travel says so covered strangle should treat as hold not two parts put",

What you're saying here is a covered strangle and a covered strangle has three legs, which also includes a share component. So I'm not sure which one you're discussing here. But they're they're different strategies. A covered strangle. I understand. That's completely different now. Now I understand. So for a covered strangle, that is based on whatever you would want to do with the put because for a covered strangle, there would also be shares. In this case, we would have at least 100 shares of a stock because there's a short call out. I guess a short call starts here. So if we want to do something with the put, then for the covered strangle, there's a couple of questions I ask. Is why am I taking the put off that 50 max profit? Do I think that risk is going up? Do I make 50 max profit in two days? And I want to roll the short put up to make more money to follow the trend. Am I trying to reduce overall exposure of the covered strangle position,",

So maybe I take two of these down or all three of them. This, the entire premise of the management of this put is not just taking it down because it's in profit, but it's what happens next. And one of the first questions to answer this is if I'm trying to take the short put down just because it's in profit, then the next question you naturally have to ask yourself is, is there something else that then I can put on after I take this off? And if there's not a good answer to that, then don't do that. So what I mean by that is you might look at taking this, these short puts down. And then you might say, well, I don't actually want to sell more because I don't want to move the delta up. I don't want to move further out in time. Then maybe these just stay on instead versus just taking them down at like a 50 max profit. So it does go back to the same concept",

Then maybe these just stay on instead versus just taking them down at like a 50 max profit. So it does go back to the same concept of what is the purpose of the strategy? What are you trying to do? But with with the covered strangle, I normally would let the option component of it take in way more profit than 50. There's no reason to cap it at 50. Unless there's again a portfolio driven purpose where we're trying to reduce risk, we're trying to gain more exposure or whatever the case is. So I would take a poke through some of the short strangle videos that I've done and see see if that helps you out. It's a good question, but it's a very nuanced, a very, very nuanced answer. Cool. I think that's all we got. That's all I got for tonight. Now, the last note I'll give you guys is I am going to be doing a new outlier options trading bootcamp come the new year. I'm in the process of building the syllabus for it actually that I talked to you guys about. And I would actually love to brainstorm that a little bit with you all. So if you don't mind hanging out for a few minutes, this is everybody can drop off. That's just trying to see what they",

So if you don't mind hanging out for a few minutes, this is everybody can drop off. That's just trying to see what they can learn from like a trading perspective. This next part is a little bit more brainstorming and helping me figure out honestly how to help you guys. So my idea for the upcoming options trading bootcamp is we've had a few prior boot camps where we've spent time working on like the very, very basics of things, right? Like the theoretical elements of options trading and stuff like that, which is kind of my idea for this one to start. But I want to figure out for most of you, because most of you are the ones that tend to be on the live streams, right? So I'd rather make live streams and I'd rather the segment be way more applicable to you all. I'd like to get a sense of how comfortable you feel with like the basics of options. And what that means is this, let me grab this. What I mean by that is if I put this up, like is there anything in here that's new to you, that's novel? My guess is for most people would be no.

The question is open-ended because I'm just trying to get a sense of what kind of things and what kind of concepts you all are ready are very familiar with and comfortable with because then the bootcamp itself will be tailored to that. So what that means is I'm still going to go through the basics. But instead of doing, for example, a first session that's all about what options are and what derivatives are, maybe if most people are comfortable with that, we can do a session that's what options are, what derivatives are as an overview, and then we can cover a couple other things, like who the market participants are and stuff like that. So that's my, that's what I'm thinking about. And what I'm probably going to do is keep those videos specifically to an hour, like a very strict hour. And the reason why I'm going to be more strict about that is because one of the pieces of feedback that I got in the last one is that there was for people that were like watching the recordings, it was a little difficult because during a lot of the videos, I was taking questions and stuff in the",

That's probably what I need to improve the most. So you have to be a little more specific with respect to opportunity costs. Do you mean like other trades? And if so, other other trades, you can literally track that in a excel sheet, right? Like in your trading log, that's what I do is I don't just track the trades that I have on.

And that's exactly how you can track the performance for those and see what other trades might have done for you and see if there's any trends you can pivot between travel.

They know different areas and elements that they can break rules and why in a certain situation a rule might be broken. So for the overwhelming majority of people, specifically from our community that especially come to these sessions, right, the trading basics and for beginners, is I actually think it would be way, way, way better time spent talking about things like understanding profit mechanisms or tracking profit mechanisms. The problem with that and I've already identified this is that there literally is an element of it that just comes down to doing the work. And I might, my best guess is I think that that's where a big fall off happens for a lot of people because a lot of this stuff I think you guys are very familiar with in terms of a general process perspective, but then there's the process of actually doing the thing.

And there's no way, there's no amount of talking about it or discussing around it that will substitute for doing the thing. So I'm also cognizant of that trying to make sure that the stuff that I'm talking about will help lead us towards the thing. So I think what we might do is all finish making the agenda, the syllabus and then it'll break it down into blocks. Normally it's like a 12 a 12 week thing. So it'll be 12 hours total. I think that's about right. And then I'll split it up into 15 minute blocks and then we'll do two to three blocks per. And I'll throw that in the discord and see what you guys think. Make sure that it's moving in the correct direction and the stuff that will be useful to you guys. So super helpful. I appreciate the input. I'll probably ask for some more so that I can make sure that the stuff is solid for you all. Right on. I'm going to sign off work on a couple of videos. I will catch you guys tomorrow for the GME live stream for those that are going through that. And then if you guys need anything else, let me know. Hit me up. Be an outlier. I'll see you all later.",
