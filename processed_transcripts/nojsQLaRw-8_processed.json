    "text": "If you're a trader and you find yourself in the scenario where like I don't know what to do I can't find anything that looks good. It means that you're looking way too narrowly because the beauty of options genuinely there's always opportunity out there depending on what you do. So try to come up with a couple different approaches to trading meaning you can trade things that are going to the upside aggressively and then maybe up to the upside a little more drift style. Same thing to the downside then you have a couple strategies that allow you to trade volatility. Then all of a sudden you'll find that it's actually a factor of not struggling to find ideas but picking the best of those ideas. So if you find yourself saying, man I can't find anything that looks good that is a early warning system that you have to open up your skill set just a little bit. Be an outlier see you later.",
