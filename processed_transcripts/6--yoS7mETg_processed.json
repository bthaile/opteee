    "text": "You have to learn to be objective as a trader. That means that your preferences can be there, but they don't dictate the scenario. People all too frequently think that if I need to make one percent per week that that should be doable, it doesn't matter what you need, what matters is what's happening and then your ability to interact with it. Another great example of that is, traders will look at something and they'll say, oh my God, I can't believe that this stock is up this high, I'm gonna sell it. And then they continue to get ran over because the stock continues to go against them and they were saying, well, I can't believe this. It needs to go down. Learn to analyze things objectively. Our job as traders is to analyze things, figure out what best fits the scenario and then to make money, not to come up with what you think you want to happen and then try to trade that in front of the market. Be an all-er-seal leader.",
