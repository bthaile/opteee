    "text": "What's up everybody, Eric here. Welcome back to the Outlier podcast where we talk all things abnormal. We're looking to understand kind of high-end performance, what that looks like, how we get there, how people achieve it. And I got my friend back on Richard. This is your second time on the podcast, but welcome back. Great to have you. Well, thank you. It's great to be here. And we had such a good time last time that I can't see. We're only going up from here. That's, I mean, that's the goal. I never really underestimate my ability to dork stuff up, but, you know, I think we'll be all right. I'm pretty confident we're going to do okay. So one of the random questions I have complete, complete aside, but obviously your background is in psychology. And that's what we talked a lot about in the last conversation. And from a general perspective, I am very curious what your take is specifically on the impact of like COVID isolation on traders. What impact do you think that that had from a psychological standpoint? Well, if we look at the broad range of possible careers or jobs, probably that's the minimum impact. I mean, traders tend to be introverted. They tend to be engineers. They tend to be more technically oriented or, you know, focusing on the screen is where they get their jollies. So people come and go, so my guess is it's minimal. Now I'm always happy",

Now I'm always happy to hear from people who said, nope, COVID really did me enter. Man, COVID was a real boon for me because I got to stay home and didn't have to go into the office and I trade part time. So I would be really interesting to see how traders actually answer that question. But my guess is on the scale of things, probably not so much. Yeah, that's actually a really fair expectation. It's I share most of it. One of the things I do hypothesize and I'm curious or take on it is with more people being funneled into trading that might not have been traders before. We kind of saw that during COVID and expansion in trading activity from the retail perspective at least. I wonder if that cohort specifically because during COVID more so being pushed into trading, not being able to directly connect with other people, if they were looking to connect more with traders online, other traders trading communities. And if that had any impact on performance because anything that I've read from a broader study perspective off of something like SSR and social science research network, it seems to find that when retail traders",

So again, maybe it's a little too loosely put together for there to be direct ties there. But I was wondering if during COVID more people trading that haven't been trading before, those people, newer people tend to want to connect with others and whatever they're doing because they know they don't know what they're doing. Did that lead to a potential rise in people banning together, sharing ideas and what impact that would have on the experience? Yeah, well, I don't have any data on that. I don't have any information. So all I know is that when traders first start, what you mentioned is that there's just an overwhelming amount of data, material, strategies, time, preferences. Oh my gosh, risk preferences. It's just, it's a complex adaptive system. And as a result, there's an infinite amount of inputs that impact other inputs. So it can be really overwhelming.

Actually, I just turned 33 yesterday. Oh, man, you're so young. Oh, geez. Don't don't ever say that you were young. Like an ARP card soon or something. I don't know when you get those, but but what I've really developed an appreciation for at least in my existence is an appreciation of the process in embracing delayed gratification. I think a big part of that came from just the early activities that I got into when I was young, things like martial arts, weightlifting, you don't really see instant results in any of those things. And you actually kind of go through periods where you're putting in perceivably a lot of effort and you're seeing very little out of it. But you just keep doing it. You just keep seeing it through. And I find that really to have helped me a lot in trading. Now, one of the things I see a lot in traders is that and this is my opinion again, seeking",

Now, one of the things I see a lot in traders is that and this is my opinion again, seeking your expertise. It seems like traders often over emphasize any one single trade. And they kind of forget that each one of these trades ideally is part of a well-developed system that's designed to be bared out over years, hopefully. Well, it's not only every single trade, but how about every single tech? Oh, my dreams are going to come true. Wow, I'm going to have that Ferrari. Well, my dad's going to respect me. Wow. Oh, tick tock. Oh, my God. Maybe I should get out. Oh, oh, no, no, no. Oh, it's gone. It's a hit into my stop. I better cancel the stop. I can't end my dream. So yes. So what you talked about is process. And when you're weightlifting, that's a really good metaphor because like for a long time, I didn't exercise. My back gave me problems. And it was just all sorts of things. You know, getting out of a car. I had a lift my leg up. I'm going to be 77 this year. So, you know, time takes a toll. But I started doing some exercises.

And it leads to a follow-on question I have for you because it's something I've kind of employed over my life. I think a lot of it's just from my time in the Marine Corps where you're not really, I guess the easiest way to describe it is, at least for a Marine officer, our ideal leader is somebody that is the keel to a ship. Somebody that when shit is going haywire, they're calm, cool, collected, they have a plan and they will work through it. Same thing if everybody's having a great time, that same leader is still probably more so leaning towards comical and collected. And what I think about in my life in general is I have no problem like feeling happiness. I'm generally, I tend towards happiness. I'm a happy human being. I'm happy to be here. But when I'm executing something like my trades, I really keep any of that in check. And one of the things I postulate, and again, I'm wondering if your research bears this out or your experience where if a trader goes through this process where they experience elation, to me what I typically think about",

I think it's way too difficult to isolate just feeling good and never feeling bad.

Does it good to have like a big carrot in front of you? Be more disciplined, use little powers, shove those emotions down, don't recognize that? We have a different approach. So it's first is awareness. So we have, in fact, I could even show you on a screen, we have something called our set scores, sensations, emotions, and thoughts. And we score them.

So awareness, acceptance, and agency. Interesting. So in that process, then, do you guys have tools to try to mitigate the inclusion of either euphoria or despair? Well, Eric, we don't mitigate. We say, well, like, for example, the other day, I was really down about something. And I could say, rich, don't be down. Mitigate this down this. Or I could say, wow, that's fascinating. I'm really down. What's going on? Now, this is really important to me. And it's not going like I expected. What do I have attached to it? Oh, I have some attached, some meaningful behaviors for the next few years. And if this doesn't go, that kind of dream that I was unaware of kind of collapses. Okay, no wonder. Huh, okay, rich. You're all right. So let's reevaluate the dream. So in other words, what I did right there was rather than mitigating the feeling is awareness, accepting it. What is its message for me? So oftentimes we'll come up in private coaching with voices. Different parts of ourselves that represent a piece of legacy behaviors or beliefs that are preventing us from getting what we want.

So what you do is when he's under either stress or anxiety or whatever, you give him some activity to do that for that moment is going to relieve that pressure. Is that right? Yeah. That sounds right. Okay. So may I give you an appreciation? Please. A lot of people beat themselves up. A lot of people hurt themselves. A lot of people don't allow themselves any kind of gratification at all. Gratification at all. So the appreciation is, thank you, are giving Eric some gratification and helping him feel better in some situations when he's trading. So my appreciation. Thank you. Good. So now that we have that straight and you give him gratification, how does that work out in just in terms of trading in the long term when you're doing that? Typically decreases performance. And how does that impact Eric's gratification? Negatively. Negatively. So what you do is in the moment like a drug or something like that, you get a you give him a momentarily high, but there's over the longer term, there's a bigger price to be paid for that.

So then the first impulse to intervene was there. Then that impulse was suppressed. And then from there, the trade started moving in the other, it was a short strangle to be clear. So I had risk both to the downside and so it started going the other direction as trades do. And the I think of the desired intervention was as it was moving back up, the impulse was, this was already a loser today. It's now a good winner objectively. You can just exit now, take your profit and then move on. Okay. So let's go back to that exact moment where the inner bitch came to you and said, take your profit now. Okay. So imagine the screen, the market's going up, is that right? And it's heading to the other side of the strangle. Okay. So I want you to just stay with that and step into that world. You can look at the screen or just imagine the screen. And notice the voice in your head. And what is the voice saying? Sorry, just to clarify, am I going back to that point in time? I went first came in. Okay. Got it. At that point in time, right now I am. So present tense. Right now the",

So dropping down into the primitive brain, the inner bitch, and that taken over versus the higher level neocortex cognitive part. Yeah, there's like a very big debate slash fight going on between those. I'm going to diverge a little bit here. Well, movie world wars. See, have you seen that Brad Pitt? And at some point he's running with his family up to stairs in a building or something on. And he's touched by a zombie, which means that he could be coming zombie and kill his family or maybe not. He doesn't know. So he stands on the edge of the building, leans forward, is far forward as he can without falling. And the hope is at that moment that he feels he's turning into a zombie as enough agency to lean forward and fall and save his family. So it's that kind of thing.

What do we call that? Does that have a name? Eric is me. Eric. Okay. So and Eric knows that this is a probability game.

I think the overwhelming thought is regardless of the outcome of this one single event, the system has to play out in order for it to have any efficacy. Right.

I appreciate that you're paying close attention to each individual trade and trying to achieve an optimal outcome. So let it go part. I'm not sure what to do there. Yeah. So I've given you appreciation. You've done your job. Well done. Thank you. And goodbye for now. And we'll see you again. Try that or something else. So I've given you the appreciation. Thank you for what you've done. Goodbye for now. Okay. How does that feel? What are you noticing your body as you do that? It's an interesting. Honestly, the biggest thing is it's fascinating to take on the avatar of the inner bitch. So I think it feels interesting to like spend time viewing the world from that perspective that I spend so much time to your point just stuffing down. Excellent. So what you're doing, this is just to start making that connection and a positive, healthy relationship with that part. So we're not stuffing. We're not disciplining. We're not well-power. In fact, the opposite. We're appreciating. That voice has a lot to say about your experience from when you were a kid and growing up. It's repeated patterns. What happens is when we're powerless",

What happens is when we're powerless and we don't have many many options in our life, interesting or trade options, we don't have many options in our life, we create the avatars, we create the parts of ourselves that when we're powerless, we give us momentary relief. The younger we are, the more that pattern replicates itself in every part of our lives. So in my example, my mom was depressed, distant. I remember one kind thing from her, all my life. That's brutal. And my response was to be self-sufficient emotionally. Boy, did that help out? Man, that saved this little kid from going crazy or doing drugs or all sorts of other I did some destructive behaviors, but fortunately I live. Who doesn't? Who does? But that part, as I grew older to be that self-sufficient emotional part, that's what I wanted. That's what I needed. But we tend to repeat the survival patterns that saved us.

It's like on a daily basis, I'm fighting with the inner bitch about everything. Perfect example. My birthday was yesterday. My wife made me brownies. I don't need to eat. I don't need to eat. Thank you. I don't need to eat a brownie. It doesn't, it does not need to be in my diet. But then the inner bitch goes to, oh, well, your wife made them for you. You can't not eat them. It's just impactful. You would enjoy the brownie. But meanwhile, the higher part of my mind is saying, I don't need the fucking brownie. So I'm not going to eat it. So it's like what you're highlighting there, kind of that revisiting of that survival mechanism, it actually clarifies a pretty significant question I've had for some time now, which is, I already know the outcome of most of these instances.

But for kind of a Neanderthal like myself, it is kind of a knob realization that you connected the pleasure, seeking behavior, the instant gratification preference, you connected it with a positive motive.

    "text": "it is kind of a knob realization that you connected the pleasure, seeking behavior, the instant gratification preference, you connected it with a positive motive. That's really interesting to me because typically I look at it as obviously the impact on the broad system. But I don't even acknowledge that the short term gratification seeking is actually like genuinely positively incentivized in some capacity. That's a very interesting point. And in some contexts, it's actually wonderful. And so one thing we have to do is look at the context. Just like a trading strategy is really useful in a certain market maker context, that gratification when we're looking at some more central behaviors, for example. God, that's wonderful. A question for you. One of the big motivations and kind of integrations in my psychology is stelicism. I'm a huge practicer of stelicism. And a big part of stelicism is things like when I think about mitigating unwanted behavior, most of the time the way that I do that isn't just kind of just trying to stuff it down. I normally think of it more as like logically trying to reason through it. But even as I reasoned through these, the trade process is a great example. As I reasoned through that, that inner bitch still emerges from time to time. And it tries to direct behavior. So what would your prescription be if any that can really manage how frequently that voice emerges or is it something from your experience",

I haven't made that connection. And for people who are really disciplined and it works well for, my guess is they have such a pleasure of the discipline process itself that's stepping into the discipline isn't a struggle, but it's a pleasure because they've learned that it gives them long-term gratification. So I'm not against discipline unless it creates an inner struggle. But if we're stepping into it and say, wow, this feels better. Every morning, I'll do my inside exercises three, four days a week.

So that is easier to give me one sec. We can make it. Okay. So this is a study. It's called the behavior of individual investors by Barbara Nadine from University, California. It's an older study. But essentially what they find, they look at the trading behavior of individual investors. And they look to summarize some of the commonalities between them. And there's a couple of here that I really focus on when I'm talking at least to my audience. My argument here is that if you want to be successful at something, it's important to do two things. It's important to see what the successful people that are doing or doing and to see what you can pick up from them. But it's equally as important to look at the droves of people that fail so that you know not to do some of those behaviors.",

    "text": "two things. It's important to see what the successful people that are doing or doing and to see what you can pick up from them. But it's equally as important to look at the droves of people that fail so that you know not to do some of those behaviors. And there's three things in here specifically that I find very interesting. And I'm curious if you have a thought on one, two, all three as it pertains to traders. And I'll just read them out really quick for anybody listening to the audio side of this. One of them says, and again, this is in reference to individual investors. So this is looking at their behaviors. One of them says, Del winning investments while holding losing investments in the disposition effect. The next one is our heavily influenced by limited attention and past return performance in their purchase decisions. And then the next important one is engage in naive reinforcement learning by repeating past behaviors that coincided with pleasure, inner bitch that mother buck her while avoiding past behaviors that generated pain. So the inner bitch that is learning to appreciate the pleasure it gives me and I am learning to work with it to invite it into the appropriate context. So when you say you give it a negative connotation, I am looking and inviting you to rephrase that in a positive way. Okay. So yes, we sell winning investments because it feels so good in the moments",

If we have something that's underwater, we don't lose money. I've done surveys. Do you lose money? If you don't take a lot and the answer is 80 of the traders say no. We really? Yes. So you don't lose money until you've closed the position. Oh, that's the belief. So needless to say, you may be familiar with prospect theory. And that says that we get twice as much pain for a given loss as gain for the same, same gain. And evolutionarily speaking, that makes a lot of sense. So we sell our winning investments. Yes.

So if you were to prescribe an activity specifically for number two and number four here, to help mitigate both of those, what activity would you prescribe? Well, what we do is we rewire the brain. I work with traders to create something we call lousy and lucrative traits. A lousy trade or let's say a lucrative trade is one where you got enough rest. You did your pre-planning for the morning. You were watching you executed the trade at the right time. You stayed in it according to your strategy and your plan and you got out. That is a lucrative trade. Now it doesn't matter if it made money or it didn't. Right. Because we know over the larger sample size, if executed in the right type of market, it's going to make money.

When I'm trading with them and I'm there and I'm just doing email and just watching them and whatever, not once. Yeah. Not once do they go off the rails and why? I'm constantly inviting them to their highest self, to that agency self. And to make a lousy trade to slip down to it would be so embarrassing for them that they don't do it. So what we're doing is start to make new neurological connections. If I'm there, oh, I can do this. Oh, I can do it more. And then like my exercise in the morning, even if my upper level says, I don't feel like it. All of a sudden, I find myself on the floor doing my workout. I love that. And I think it applies something that really holds true, at least with the way that I approach most things, which is kind of a building block modality, right? You're talking about requiring synapses essentially. And that's a process that takes place over time with incremental steps, which I really like that that approach. There's one of the things I try to help people when it comes to building habits. It's so funny. People will look at me and they'll be like, dude, you're like a robot.

And you imagine that world. You have survived. Good. What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what? What's it? Yeah. You've survived growing up in a difficult family. You've survived the Marines. You've survived it by fighting with yourself. That's been a process that is part of your deepest survival mechanism. Imagine for a moment, what if, what if Eric didn't have to fight himself? What if there was another way to survive as an adult?

I'm not sure maybe you have a different opinion, but I'm not sure that a world exists where somebody can achieve and continue to pursue kind of next step performance in whatever they're trying to achieve without bumping into discomfort. And then I guess the argument I pose is that that discomfort breeds misalignment. Well, I can say that that has worked for you. And I can also suggest there is another world outside of that where discomfort or like when you're pushing your resistance muscles and you feel the burn, you can go yes, yes. You can step into another layer of discomfort and go yes. The language you use and maybe it's just a language problem and I'm misunderstanding it that I'm fighting myself. I have to fight. I have to push. And that may be a way of life for you and that is okay. But I'm going to just plant a little seed that says, Eric, you've fought everything all your life.
