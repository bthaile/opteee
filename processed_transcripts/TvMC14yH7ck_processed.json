Trading options says wondering when to get out of a vertical spread. Simple question, but this goes actually back to literally what I was just talking about. How important it is to have the fundamentals down. So the brief answer to that question is when to get out of a vertical spread actually has nothing to do with it being a vertical spread, a horizontal spread, it doesn't matter what the spread is. It is everything to do with what the strategy is. So the way that you answer that question trading your options is honestly not worrying about vertical spread at all. That's ancillary details that will be added on to what you're doing later. What needs to be defined first in that scenario is what's the strategy? And based on that strategy, then what makes sense to close your position out. So we could take a look at a couple examples of something like that to see if we can help dial this in. But I'll show you this right here. This is from just this random deck that I've made. I use like a reference for us. But this is what I call the outlier trade process.

But this is what I call the outlier trade process. There's two main process docs that I continually reference and put in front of you. There is the outlier strategy process. And then there's the outlier trade process. The strategy process is exactly what it sounds like. It focuses on strategy level and development of actual option strategies or just trading strategies. The trade process is the execution of a specific strategy. So what you're talking about now in terms of your question trading your options is actually down here. You're in step three of the outlier trade process. Now you'll notice that you're effectively in the execute trade stage. And in that execution, the question is, well, where do we exit this vertical option? The way to think about answering these questions is you have to put first things first. And first things in this scenario stem from what is the strategy that you're trying to trade? And I'll give you a couple examples. Let's say that I'm looking at the broad market right now. And we're in SPX. So we'll look at SPX. And let's say that I have a vertical spread in SPX. And as you may or may not know, we can be longer short vertical spreads.

And as you may or may not know, we can be longer short vertical spreads. So in this context, let's say that I'm long of vertical spread. And the entire premise of my long vertical spread is directional. I'm my basis. The profit mechanism, the basis for the trade is a directional assumption of some sort. So let's say I think SPX, just using a random example, SPX is going to go down. Let's say I think that. And therefore, I decide to buy a put spread. Well, if I buy that put spread and SPX starts going up, I'm wrong. So depending on where based on my strategy and my approach, I would be fully disproven. I would be fully shown that I'm wrong. Meaning you have to give the trade a little bit of room. This comes from the strategy element of this phase because your question will open up other questions as you start to solve your original question. So again, back to the original question, when do you close a vertical spread? Well, we have a bunch of questions we have to ask. The main one is what's the strategy? Is it long or short?

So if we go back to the ally or strategy process here, you'll notice that we have to go through two key stages defining the profit mechanism. In this case, we're talking the profit mechanisms directional. And then we're talking about the behavior of the profit mechanism. So this one can effectively be summed up to behavior. So looking within the behavior of the profit mechanism, I'll tack this on so that it's clear, when we're looking within the behavior of a profit mechanism, not all directional trading is built the same. So what that means is going back to this basic idea, if I think SPX is going to go down, price can go down in different ways. Here's an example. This range here to here, take a look at what price did from here to here. Price went down really aggressively, three days consecutively. That's a different movement pattern than something like from here to here. Price also went down here over also three days, but much less so. It's not built the same. So that means that the way that I'm going to trade these two different scenarios might be different. So one of the beautiful things about vertical spreads is very frequently.

You just kind of leave them on. Now you do have to be worried about early assignment of one of your legs, specifically the short leg, or assignment if it expires in the money. So to parameterize the condition, easy place to start is, well, we know we're going to close it before expiration. We know that because unless you're trading an index option that settles to cash, there is assignment risk and you might not want to carry that inventory. Okay, so that gives us starting point. We know that it's going to be before expiration. So then the question is when before expiration and then that goes back to what the strategy is. If we're trading some sort of, let's say for example, instead of trading this via a long put spread, I choose instead a short all spread. Well, if it goes against me, I kind of expect that to happen.

Hopefully that it really, anybody that gives you a blanket answer to that question is straight up bullshitting you because it doesn't make sense. There isn't a blanket answer to that question beyond something like before expiration. And even that's not a blanket answer because again, if you're trading index options or for example, if I'm trading zero DTEs or one three four DTEs and SPX, there's very frequently that I'll have a vertical component leg to that as of lately. And I'll let it go into expiration. So even that isn't really a blanket answer, that's fully applicable all the time. It's highly nuanced depending on what you're doing. So that's really where you have to answer that. You have to start by defining what you're doing and working backwards from there. Because again, another scenario for me often is if I'm using a vertical spread, I personally am going to use the width of the strikes and the size to serve as my risk management. That's how I'm managing the risk in the trade. So and it's because multi-leg strategies, I don't want to move them that much. I don't want to have to enter exit, enter again, the lot of legs.

And then if I am trading some sort of vertical spread in an individual name, again, going back to what we do know, it's going to have to be closed before expiration or if there's a really assignment risk. It's not a big deal if you get assigned with the legs, but it's just an annoyance. It does become a little more confusing slash complex if it is something that expires on the money. So if you're trading it that way, we're using the vertical to define the risk and size, then your management approach is going to look way different. Then if you're using it as simply a way to manage the margin requirement, if you have a smaller account, what that means is you might sell a 30 delta call, but rather than buying something that's a little further out of the money, maybe like a 25 delta or something like that, you're going to buy like a really cheap wing that's like a 10 delta or a 5 delta, where that's not really designed to be a risk management",

That's more designed just to cap the margin requirement for smaller accounts. So a lot of nuance is always this is the fun part in my opinion with options is that there are very few simple basic answers even to seemingly very simple questions like that. But I hope that gives you at least some ideas to start with. You really have to take a look at the strategy. And once you define what you're doing with the strategy and how the vertical spreads allow you to capture the profit mechanism and the behavior of that profit mechanism, then you can come up with some logical ideas based on what might make sense in terms of your assets.

And it's because if you're a well-rounded option trader, there's kind of almost always something you can do. And if you're finding that you're not able to find things to do that you like, well, that's obviously giving you a glaring pointing sign that there are some massive holes in the game that we need to round out. So I totally understand that sentiment. That's probably the case for a lot of people. One of the things that I think option traders get caught up in like these general advice pieces that you'll hear from other types of trading is like, oh, like cash is a position too, you can move to cash. Again, that's really you can, but for obfuscitating that's really not highly applicable. A lot of the times you'll hear that will come from stock traders that trade from the long side only.

It might make sense for a lot of those people to sit and cash. And that's one of the artifacts of a stock trader's return profile. This is a really important concept to understand as a trader with like what we're doing as option traders compared to what other traders do as stock traders, canceling traders, whatever other trading approach you want to highlight. Because if we take a time series like this, and let's say that this is a 10-year time series, and let's say that this is year zero. And we just add a couple notches in here. We'll do one more here. And there are periods where a stock trader's returns, let's use green for a stock trader. Stock trader returns might, let me finish the axis here. This is percent return. So you might have a canceling style stock trader that might have a year that looks kind of like this. And then the second year looks like this. And then the next year is like this.

They can have literally thousands of percent's return depending on how aggressive they are in these time frames. Right? So we can take a look over the course of this four-year time frame. And we can say, yeah, wow, like they really, really crushed it here. This is a super solid return. However, they're also going to have periods where they either are going to go down quite a lot, or there might just be nothing to do. Their fastball might not apply.

But there's less total volatility in the way that I seek to trade compared to what a Canceling Style trader might see. So the reason why all this matters is because when options traders hear things like, oh, cash is a position, you can sit in cash, you can sit and do nothing, you can. It's a choice. But there's a downside to that choice. Because while the Canceling Stock Trader might have a year that gives them a 3000 percent return, the probability of you seeing that as an options trader is super fucking low. So what that means is you need to be way more consistent in your return profile. So that in the aggregate, it ultimately pans out. So it's something to be aware of. Cash is fine. But getting too comfortable being cash becomes really dangerous. And then also again, if you're an options trader and you're looking at a market like right now, sitting in a lot of cash, you're like, man, I don't know what to do.

So then you're way more incentivized to just go off script because the entire thing is off script. It's very difficult to adhere to anything in that context. The reason why I mentioned that in that way is to help you with positive attribution. It's actually identified the thing itself that needs to work on. So the way you fix this thing that you're talking about, Lauren, is not by sitting there saying like, damn, you know, I have paper hands. I got to be more resilient and holding my trades. That's not going to fix it. What's going to fix it is actually building a strategy and understanding the way that that thing behaves. Again, great example. If we go back to SPX and let's say that we're trading short-term premium again, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, whatever DTE time premium you want to use. But let's say that we're using sell side strategies. We're selling premium. Well, if I am undisciplined in my approach in doing this, what you'll notice is let's say for example that there's an entry here for a zero DTE trade on this candle.

And the reason why that happens so much is because you're playing human nature at that point. And you're playing into something that's completely unknown. So this person that doesn't have an understanding of how these things move is going to be the paper hand person that's going to exit down here because it looks terrible.

But then you can apply that same framework for whatever it is in GameStop that has you in there. If you're a standard GameStop trader that's more just kind of like on the holdable team, then you have to develop other profit mechanisms to apply and other things. But yeah, this is this is where you got to spend some time to come up with other trade ideas because right now, and I put this out in a recent newsletter, I've talked about this quite a lot, but right now there's literally a million things to do.

Like right now, the coverage triangle is not performing well. I think the overall return for it for the year, the last lot was like 2, not doing well.

So everything that we do here is going to come down to a trade-off. So the two that you can check out that I do think are worth looking at. The first one is O rats. And there's links to these and most of the recent videos that I've done. You'll see there's an affiliate link in there. I do get it, kick back. It's honestly trivial, but you get a discount. That's the reason I found them is because I get asked that kind of a lot. And I wanted to find something that I at least feel good to recommend to people because again, I normally just use my own stuff. But O rats is solid. And they also have an API infrastructure so you can just pull data from them as well to then manipulate and tinker with on your own. They have their own series of issues, though. One of the issues I have with what O rats does is they infer deltas. That's inaccurate. So there's in general, it doesn't make that big of a difference. But again, for somebody like me that wants things precise. That's in precise. It's a data management approach because storing full Greeks, full options chains for every single underlying for the last 20 years is like tremendously large data. So because of that, you",

It's a data management approach because storing full Greeks, full options chains for every single underlying for the last 20 years is like tremendously large data. So because of that, you can run some shortcuts. You can say, well, the delta of this call is 45 delta. So one minus that is the put and it might not be, especially for things that are further out in time and more volatile. So that can impact what you're doing. So there's small artifacts like that that you just have to accept. There's a free solution through thinkorswim. And that's cool. The problem with that free solution is there's no way in aggregate to run an idea. You have to click and move everything. So I like that actually for a slew of different reasons, but that's the trade off for that. Another one is options omega. They're pretty solid. I like their data set. I look through it actually pretty early on. The thing that is really restrictive about them is they're really focused on a specific series of trading, mostly short term trading styles and indices. They don't offer a lot of names. So that's the trade off for that. Then as soon as you want to start applying management, I want to get out at this option.

Then as soon as you want to start applying management, I want to get out at this option. If it's at x percent return or if the underlying did this, good luck. You're going to run out of stuff insanely fast that can do anything like that. So one of the things to keep in mind is with back testing is I think one of the things you have to get comfortable with as a trader is using imperfect information and being comfortable with that. But you want to rough out ideas. So again, for example, if I'm trading SPX here to the downside, does it materially matter if I sell a 30 delta or a 33 delta call? Does it materially do a degree to be honest because that can yield maybe a point difference in total performance. But what really matters is my ability to even have a shot at predicting direction. That matters so much more. So it doesn't matter if I'm spending too much time trying to optimize between the 30 delta versus 31 delta or should I exit at 50 max profit or should I exit at 55 max profit. None of that matters if everything else isn't in order being your ability to identify a profit mechanism in signal. The beautiful part about that is it's easier to find. You don't need to run these",

The beautiful part about that is it's easier to find. You don't need to run these super complex back tests to understand those things. So going back to the intraday example I gave you before in SPX, if I am trading long premium, short premium strategies for that time frame, it doesn't ultimately matter if I understand how it tends to move. That's what matters way more because then it's going to inform the strategy that I use. So the summation for all of that is I personally use my own stuff and it's because I treat this professionally. This is my livelihood. So that's a cost of doing business and I've already talked about this before. I've talked about this years ago where I literally have spent over six figures on just data, literally just market data and it's a cost of doing business. However, for people that don't necessarily take it that seriously or to that degree, then you don't necessarily have to spend anywhere near that much. You can spend a lot less, but then again, there's trade-offs. Maybe you don't have minute level or intraminent. Maybe you don't have full Greeks. Maybe you have a smaller suite of tickers that you're going to use. It's customizable. You don't have to spend a",

But yeah, it's a little bit, definitely a little bit tricky to find something that works well. Let me see. Salad sandwich says, do you foresee a giant GME bone cone? I haven't looked that close. To be honest, I haven't spent a lot of time getting reacquainted. I was planning on doing that tomorrow. But I mean, as of right now, there's nothing necessarily jumping out at me. But that's also a very ignorant statement at this point. Just because I don't really know what's going on. I haven't really gone through it. So probably should have a little bit more on that tomorrow, I think. H says, do you care about slash, try to sculpt your sharp ratio? I don't really try to sculpt it. I mean, it's really important to be aware of what your risk adjusted returns are. And honestly, it's also funny because like sharp ratio really, I don't even think is like an optimal risk management or assessment thing. It's just something that institutions use, fund managers use.

It's just something that institutions use, fund managers use. So then retail traders like, oh, shit, I should use this one. I always find that comical. But yeah, I do think in a more broad sense, risk adjusted returns are super important. It's because it gives you the entire context of scalability is an idea scalable. And if you have something that has a really great compound annual growth rate, for example, but a really poor risk adjusted return, that might not be super scalable, even though it has a really sexy look in compound annual growth rate. And it's because there's a reality when systems produce things, they can produce things that are purely optimized. This is like the same thing with Kelly sizing. If you use Kelly criterion for trade sizing, Kelly criterion does exactly what Kelly criterion tells you what's going to do, which is optimized for growth that comes at a tremendous cost, which is absolute fear for your fucking life because of what it's going to tell you to do at different times with respect to sizing. And you're going to be like, yo, I am not comfortable with that at all. And that's why they have things like half Kelly quarter Kelly.

JG says, what helps you determine what delta you are choosing to sell your short calls, more specifically with the ratio diagonal? Great question. So for that one specifically and for those that are curious, what that strategy looks like, it's pretty simple in its shape. So let's take a look at something like Palantir. And let's say that we have a ratio called diagonal, yearly hypothetically, link, link, and Palantir. And let's say in this hypothetical ratio called diagonal, we're out right now in the 16",

So we have a 25-lot at the 65s. And let's say that we're selling short calls against them. And the question right now is what delta? So it starts always with what is the idea behind the trade, behind the individual positions. So in this case, if I'm trading something like Palantir that I think is still bullish in the longer term, but not necessarily given the current environment hyper bullish, likely going to just slowly meander if it is able to sustain the up move, which I would broadly assume again over a long enough time frame, then I'm not so concerned about capping the upside. Now again, this is in context. I never want a flat upside profit potential. So because of that, there's a series of choices I can make.

Now for the way that I run the ratio called diagonal, it's about time for these to come down. They need to go away because they need to be moved further out in time. They're coming in on the time window for management of the ratio called diagonal because of that. Going back to the delta question on the short calls. Well, I know that the longs need to come down. So what I can do is get more aggressive on the shorts if I'm so inclined, depending again on how far I think it's going to move. So what that means is this, if I have 30 of these, let's clear these ones out.

So with the break even at 104, do I think that the option itself or the underlying itself is likely to go super far above 104, depending on my answer to that, that will determine if I want to sell something like this, the 95s, or do I want to go a little further out of the money? Because if I think that balance here is likely to roll over a little bit and start to come back down, then I actually want to be way more aggressive with these calls. I can make way more money with them than just holding the underlying or holding the long options and just waiting to see what happens. So as always, it's a dance. But the dance is really based on those first two inputs. It's what do I think the underlying is going to do? And it's what is the strategy as it's put on? Where am I at in the phases of the strategy? And based on those, I'm going to choose to get either more or less aggressive both with the short call deltas, but then also how many I will sell both of those influence that condition. So again, as always, you all know this by now. Simple questions really do not have simple answers in the trading world.",

There's nothing, there's nothing to say that you can't specialize in individual stock if it's working. Right? Like if something is working, then that's okay. You can do, you can absolutely do what's working. But this goes back to having very clearly defined goals as a trader, what you're trying to accomplish. And then if whatever it is that you're doing, if it directly moves you closer to being able to accomplish those goals, then the one underlying might be completely fine. But if you're looking at the performance of that one underlying against what you're trying to do and you're like, fuck, this doesn't really line up with what I want to happen.

If you don't mind, when trading vertical spreads, which is the best time of day to get more premium, um, depends on a million things. The very brief answer to that question is the beginning of the day is often going to have more volatility. And often towards the end of the day is likely going to have more volatility. It will depend on a million things. I'm praying that you're trading, underlying that you're trading what the current market conditions are. Yadda, yadda, yadda. And again, based on the broader strategy, I don't know what you're doing, but that question opens up a bunch of questions in my mind to the primary is, what are we doing that getting the most premium in a day matters that much?

But the reason why the approach matters so much is because the way I'm thinking about it is like episode one, this would be things like landscape, analysis, mindset, mindset. Again, I hate mindset that kind of like term just because it's so abused and really esoteric and it's stupid. But there's a specific angle that I intend to approach it from that I think obviously is not stupid. Otherwise, I wouldn't waste the time on it. I think when it comes to mindset, the overwhelming majority of traders approach trading with the exact wrong mindset that quite literally sets them up for pure failure. So my goal is to help people identify those kinds of mindsets that really are probably more prone to their failure than their success to at least develop a healthy relationship.

Because again, as per usual, if I told you that over the course of your options trading career, you're going to have to iterate on something. That means you do something, you observe an outcome, you take the outcome details that you can, you build it back into the process and then you observe the next outcome and you do this over and over again. That's what trading is. With that, as I still talk to most traders, they still don't have literally the fundamental tools you need in order to implement an iterative process, like a plan, like a strategy outline, like a trade log. This is akin to being a truck driver, but your truck has no wheels. It's not going to work. It's literally not going to work.

So this is literally following the outlier strategy process and the outlier trade process from end to end. So again, what I'm asking you to keep in mind is I'm outlining these broad ideas. I'm coming up with this now. This isn't, again, thought out yet. I want to know one, what your thoughts are on these broad topics, what specific questions and stuff do you have about these topics so that I can build it into the series. So we know here that there's stuff about analyzing logs, which is a great question. And that's perfect because that fits directly into this one, the outlier trade process. So that's a good example there. And then EP4, episode four, this is evolution. The way I think about evolution here, it's going back to this point over here. It's ingesting information and its optimization and exploration of new ideas, new ways to do things, different ways to maybe implement existing ideas. But this is the series at a broad level that I'm thinking of. If you have questions, if this makes sense, if it doesn't make sense, if there are things that you think would make sense to add to this, I would literally love to hear it. And while you're doing that, there is a small critter scratching at the door, post dinner, ready to come back in. So",

It could be and it's something that could could work, but there's a lot of elements of that that I would consider to be quite suboptimal.

Anything that you think you know like that, the market knows. So unless there is a good reason for the persistence of some sort of idea, then it's unlikely that there's significant edge within that idea. So from your idea of using moving averages and trying to trade intradate directionally with short premium, you're kind of starting to cross over in short term direction, which is really dominated by algorithms. It's very, very difficult to outperform an algorithm in that space. So that's why like the my broader expectation there is that it would be pretty, pretty challenging. That doesn't mean not profitable. It doesn't mean that couldn't work, but I think it would be like, it's definitely different than how I trade those timeframes personally. That's for sure. But yeah, I think it's absolutely worth exploring. And if it's something that you're finding even just general interest in, meaning you enjoy it.

The thing with those credit spreads is you're probably not going to make a bunch of money. You're not going to lose a bunch of money. That's one of the benefits of trading spreads like that is they naturally have a bit of a built-in buffer to effectively keep you from hurting yourself unnecessarily. So. It's always as also theta is in my favor. I tend to simply close a trade at 50 and possibly open another trade. And that's one of the problems you're going to have with that right is the instinct to close at 50. You're trading two legs that's going to be expensive in terms of the round trips. And in terms of slippage, the other thing there is theta is slightly in your favor. It's not significantly in your favor because again, remember with that credit spread, you're buying a leg. So yes, the short option in that context is going to be the more dominant leg. And that's why it absolutely will benefit from theta for sure. But you're as that one option is benefiting from theta, the other option is getting crushed by that very same theta. So you really minimize the total theta benefit in that context.

And it's like there's a lot of lore in Ireland around fairies and leprechauns. But that's the background of that kind of random. Okay, one of the last things I want to show you guys, this was one of the coolest spots that I think we found this. So right now you can see Mel and I, we are right there.

I don't know anything about them. But I think the education itself is worth it. Now you can do those kinds of things for free, right? Like you can do open courseware from MIT and take one of their derivatives courses or something like that. But one of the things to know is the vast majority of institutional places that you're going to take those kind of courses. It's not for retail traders. They're going to be talking about derivatives investing from the lens of like banking. It's not going to be or client management. It's not going to be derivatives investing from a retail traders lens. That doesn't mean it's not useful, but it's not like this direct application thing.

This one I liked because there's like the glow of the sunset on the church. The purple in the sky was crazy. This was really neat. This fucking boat that was just sand barred. But then obviously getting like the reflection of the sunlight and all these little spots here was really, really ready. And then this is the bay. This is the hotel that we're staying at. So literally this entire it was the top floor. This entire top floor was hours, which was nuts. It was super, super cool, so obnoxious in terms of like the size of the place. We like spots that are that have really cool views. That's what I look for. And the view from that spot was really pretty. And then there's this like as the sun was setting, I took a panoramic. I actually like this panoramic a lot. So yeah, those are really some of the drone photos. I have a bunch of drone videos. I make like a little video for us just to kind of remember the trip and stuff. It's like super fun. But yeah, that's that's what it looked like. It was like a really, really solid time. We enjoyed it a lot. Very, very fun to explore. We literally drove like 1400 kilometers. Whenever we do these trips, we drive a ton so that",

We literally drove like 1400 kilometers. Whenever we do these trips, we drive a ton so that we can see a lot. We literally stay in each hotel one night. And then it's on to the next. And it's just this giant loop that we did. That was super fun. GC says, what are you a professional photographer to these pics are amazing. I appreciate it. I am a complete amateur. But I do find like flying the drone is really fun because it gives a completely different perspective, which is just really, really interesting. It allows you to experience places in a way that you otherwise would never be able to experience. This is especially a place like Ireland, the drone, obviously, was cool to capture it. But places like Norway, Iceland, Alaska, the drone there is like clutch because it literally lets you see stuff that you functionally could not get to otherwise. That wasn't really so much the case in Ireland, like most of the spots reasonably you can at least see part of. But definitely not the case in those other places. Those other places like you literally can't get to some of them. So sweet. Awesome. Well, it was absolutely stellar catching up with everybody. I'm going to work on refining down",

Well, it was absolutely stellar catching up with everybody. I'm going to work on refining down the series for this for the next few weeks at least. So if you have any input based on what I was showing you before, even if you don't have something right now, but it's something that you kind of think about a little bit later, I absolutely would love to know. My goal is to make this usable, but I want to really focus on the foundational element of this. The main reason for that is just because I think having the right mindset and the right general approach to what you're doing is absolutely so important because there's nothing else that will matter as a trader if you don't have this stuff filed in. So that's the idea. All right, gang. We are officially back. We were back to the full production schedule. So tomorrow we will have a GME stream get caught back up there. Share some updates on the covered strangle. I made a series of adjustments in that for GameStop. Sunday will be trading prep for the pro members. And then next week we are back on full cadence. So great to be back. Great to see everybody. I love seeing familiar names. There's a",

So there's people here that I actually like feel like I know to a degree, which is kind of cool. The last thing I will mention is the channel is closing in on 30k, which is so awesome. But I promised you guys a specific stream for when we hit 30,000. So I will grab the link to that because I'm also going to do a giveaway for the when we do hit it. So there will be a specific stream and then also going to offer to connect with somebody and essentially have a one on one with them, which I offer limited availability for that for like a really small number of people. But every once in a while, I like to just connect with somebody random and you know, see what we can, what we can do. So we are on our way almost there.
