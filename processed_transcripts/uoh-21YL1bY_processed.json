    "text": "Options aren't always the right product and that's a big problem with options traders even you could tell by the name there It means that they identify as trading options. I consider myself a trader sometimes most of the time I trade options But sometimes it's other things because when you trade options There are a handful of things you gotta be right on you have to be correct in terms of your direction You have to be correct in terms of your volatility assumption You have to be correct in a certain amount of time. There are a lot of things that get added when you trade an options product versus an equity product And it's not always the correct vehicle. Don't get too attached to options Think about the trade hypothesis you have and then find the right product for it being all-ersy-olour",
