And the reason why I want to talk about this is because the markets are all over the place right now. And I think traders may or may not fully comprehend what's going on behind the scenes. So I actually want to talk about what I'm seeing behind the scenes. So first let's grab the futures. And let's take a look first at Bond behavior. So we have ZNZT both down pretty significantly and trailing down hard. And if we pop over to the chart and we take a look at the corresponding yields, you'll notice exactly what you would expect to see. Something like the 10 year is now up over 4 again. This is not good. From a broad market perspective, this is not good. And I as hopefully now, I'm not in the game of doom and gloom hyperbole. I really avoid those kind of like language patterns so that what I say means what I'm trying to say. This is not good. The reason why this is not good is because it really starts to call into question what terminal rates will look like and what this whole inflation and rate cutting pictures going to look like. And it's changing rapidly. So let's take a look at the Fed watch tool. And I want to show you something. If we look back a week ago, there was a 0",

We do not have this price didn't yet. It's not priced in accurately it being whether or not we're going to get another cut. How big the cut is the impact to the cut. This is all completely up for grabs right now. Because if you take a look at the probability here of us essentially remaining no change, the probability for that hit zero starting on what the 19th, that's this green line by the way.

If this is a little too noisy for you, that's the current probability for the market. No change is the green line. And we can see that if we go back to 22 July, it was 53. And then it cratered in the early August during that decline to what 5 skyrocketed back up over the next two weeks to 61. And then another month or so cratered to zero. And now it's back up to 15.6. This is all over the place. So what does this mean for markets? Well, it tells me two really important features. The first one. This is the same exact trade that I reviewed not too long ago in the Russell where it made over 100,000. It's like the course of a week. And it was essentially playing a single move based on some of what I'm seeing here. And it's entirely about when does this get priced in? When does the start, when does the market start moving off of this information, which right now it's all over the map.

That's huge. So when I think about trading the market in a broad perspective, it's we're hanging near highs yet I see 10 year yield up over 4. So it's this is a series of red flashing signs that are kind of all over the place to me. So the way I look at this is keeping the cards really close to the chest. That's exactly how I'm positioning because if you look at small caps, they're not showing you this 25 or even 50 bips cut. They've been running flat after a decline from the previous cut, not showing us anything. We are however seen volatility expand. We are seeing tech run sideways now for what is this? A month almost, I mean, depending on where you want to call it, starting to peak, it's been about a month that we've started this rally. And then it slowed down essentially from the 19th on. It's just been rolling sideways. And then we see E minis, SP 500 hovering right near all time highs, but also massively consolidating all of that is indecision.

This is people are not necessarily wanting to weigh to heavily right now one way or the other. Let's take a look at the cop report. If we flip through here, you can see a couple really noteworthy things. Again, we're focusing primarily not on commercials, but we want large speculators, the green line. Take a look at the movement in their positioning. We hit an extreme in 2023 about the summer. They started rolling up positioning net positive, April. And we've been hovering net positive, net negative, but take a look at the change from 16 September. This was running at negative 35,000. And then if you look at it today, 70, I'm sorry, 7,500, 7550. So speculators are very, very clearly positioning here. Now again, this is for the E minis. So this is difficult to use. You kind of have to use it when it's at extremes, but this kind of movement pattern again, look how jagged this is. This is large speculators flipping positions very, very readily. And it's not a defined trend, right? So you can see periods where they'll flip the positions, but it's almost like a stair step. There's still a defined trend in there. That's not what we see in their positioning right now. It is quite",

When I say today, this is for the 30th, it lags a little bit. So I am really eager to see how this ends up resolving in the near future. The name of the game is keep a really close eye on this probability because based on how this goes, based on some of the inflation data that we're seeing coming up soon, it is going to be supremely topical. One other thing that I want to show you is if we pop up the VIX, it doesn't look that busy, right? It's definitely popping a little bit. Low 20s. There's nothing here that really jumps out at me. But then if we go into the options, let's take a look at the volume today. 430,000 calls against 233,000 puts. Take a look at where most of these calls are. They're short dated. We have 16, 25s. There's 33,000 of those that traded. Then we have the same 16, up 45s, 22,000 of those gone. This is really interesting front positioning in options that you do not typically see. It is very strange.

This is really interesting front positioning in options that you do not typically see. It is very strange. So if we look at the open interest and we take a look at this 16, there's 3.6 million calls against 2 million puts. And if we look at all series, it's about 9.5 million. So a critical density of that is short term options, which again is a little less common. A lot of times you'll see it like this where if we go further out in time, you'll notice that on the primary expiration this January, it'll typically be pretty high. And then I'm guessing we'll see around the election also very high 2.4 million. So this is expectation of a near term movement. Like that's really what this boils down to. And we have CPI, PPI coming up. This looks like it's hard to tell if it's speculating pure downside of people hedging, but this looks like something's going on. So I am preparing my portfolio for that scenario. And then again, if nothing happens, great. That's beautiful. Roll on and simply reposition.
