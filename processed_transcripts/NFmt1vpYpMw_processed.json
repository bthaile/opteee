    "text": "Oh boy, this is a hot topic, but we're going to dive right into it. The cost of defining your risk in zero DTE plays. A lot of people don't like this conversation because it starts to highlight the reality of things, but as you hopefully know, my goal isn't to persuade or dissuade anybody from anything. My goal is to share with you the objective reality of things and then let you make the decisions for yourself. So the goal of this video is to walk you through some different examples of undefined and defined risk zero DTE trades through very specifically picked markets so that you can see the bad and some of the good and then combined so that you can see what this all looks like and then at the end of the video, I'm going to share some concepts that you can use to help inform the way you structure these kinds of trades in the future. What's up everybody? Eric here. Welcome back to the outliers shout out to the Patreon family. Consider signing up and let's get straight to it. So real quick upfront recap together. Defined versus undefined risk trades, it is pretty simple. When we think about a defined risk trade in this context, we're going to look at short iron condors and this is a way for you to sell options to capitalize on variance risk premiums, which if you're unfamiliar with what that is, I'll throw a link in",

But when we're trading short premium zero DTE strategies, that's essentially what you are trying to capture variance risk premiums. Now the beautiful part about a short iron condor is that notice this there's defined risk both to the upside and the downside. This means that even if there's a massive move, you are cushioned yet you still this really nice big profit zone. That looks pretty good to me. But as with all things in trading, there are trade-offs which we'll get to in just a second. Now let's take a look at a different example which is going to be the short triangle. The profit zone on your short triangles typically will be wider if you have the same short delta. So in this case, both of these use short 20 delta in SPX. However, notice how both to the upside and to the downside, undefined risk. This is a problem for a lot of people.

And rightfully so, if you want to exist as a trader for any meaningful duration of time, you need to be thoughtful about risk. And if you hear risk undefined, it's kind of a problem. But there are different things we can do to help cushion this a little bit and ideally to move people towards a healthier relationship with undefined risk strategies because we have to talk about what's going on here. As you may or may not know, I am a nerd and I'm continually looking for studies on markets in general. And this is a pretty new one. This is from 14 January 2024.

Then here it says with implied variance consistently higher than realized variance until settlement. This that's what variance risk premiums are. That's why there's a market here. However, the success of various strategies is not guaranteed. The other thing to note though is that some of these strategies have high volatility in skewed returns that are health expiration. So all of this is to say and you should absolutely take a look at this study. It's fantastic. It's one of my favorite recent studies on this as compared to the other one about analyzing the cost of zero DTE strategies. But in this case, the landscape is if you are selling this premium, you are providing liquidity, which is a utility to the market. And part of that is we are trying to capture the phenomenon that implied variance is higher on average than realized variance. Sometimes markets move. So if you get a big enough move, this can hurt really bad. So what I want to talk about now is an example to help us dive further into this. So here I look at one Jan 2022 to",

So what I want to talk about now is an example to help us dive further into this. So here I look at one Jan 2022 to 31 December 2023. Why these two years? I wanted to pick actually a short timeframe that includes two extremes. 2022 was a pretty big down year about 20 percent. And then 2023 was a decent up year up 23 percent. And the good part about that is if you look at those two years together 2023 was not a big enough up year to overcome the loss from 2022. So this gives you two beautiful views. You have a pretty big severe down year. And then you have a subsequent up year that is strong, but still not strong enough to overcome those two years combined in terms of an average return. If you had bought at the highs, how long I threw. So working down this side over here, we have a bunch of different things. And if you'll notice, I honed in on short calls and puts at a 20 delta. So a strangle. But then for this part of the sample, I'm showing you the iron condors at three different locations, long wings at five, 10 and 15 delta.

    "text": "a 20 delta. So a strangle. But then for this part of the sample, I'm showing you the iron condors at three different locations, long wings at five, 10 and 15 delta. These are all entered at 12 PM Pacific time, 3 PM Eastern. So an hour before the close. You can tinker with the entry time and you'll see slightly different results. The point I want to highlight here more so is few things. First, notice the heighter the wings, so 20 delta and a 15 delta long. It had the worst overall PL out of these three, a lower compound annual growth rate, a much better drawdown. You would expect that if you have less room to move, we would expect to lose less in total. So if you go down here to the max loss, it's only 775. Pretty light as compared to the 20 delta shorts, five delta longs, the max loss on that was 3145, quite a bit bigger. Now notice though, the expected return on these two outside samples, which is negative in the long run, which is problematic for the strategies. Now, so what is the cost? What is the cost of buying these wings? Let's take a look. If you had sold just the 20 delta short, tall and put all else the same, you would make 26,197 over the same time frame. Your compound annual growth rate goes from a high of 4.7 to 12.3. Your max drawdown is negative 9.8.",

Your compound annual growth rate goes from a high of 4.7 to 12.3. Your max drawdown is negative 9.8. This is still pretty damn bad. Average when portrayed is 56 bucks, so on and so forth. So you can see that by just getting rid of the wings and accepting the volatility in the returns, you in aggregate make way more money. Look at the max loss here though. 56, 57. That's a big max loss, depending on the size of your account. And if you're not capable of withstanding that kind of max loss on a single trade on a one lot, you have to find different ways to get innovative here. You can scale down because if you notice here, the max profit and the max loss both not touched on either of these. So what happens if we start to modulate that just a little bit? Well, if we take a look at a 200 and then a 300 max loss for the 20 delta strangle, notice how good the returns become. Our PL grows from 26 to 36 max loss contracts from 5600 to 2,200. So what's going on here? We're cutting off the tails. If you take a look at the number of winning trades in this scenario, there's 358. Then if you take",

If you take a look at the number of winning trades in this scenario, there's 358. Then if you take a look at the number of winning trades in this scenario, there's 344. So what this is telling me is that the difference between these two conditions is 14 trades that would have been profitable that we cut off using this max loss. You generally want to avoid that. But in doing so in this sample, we've so grossly decreased our max loss that in general on average, we're not cutting off so many trades that would go outside of our range and then back in that our average win per trade is actually very strong. And then 300 max loss brings us back down a little bit, but it's still better than the unmanaged PL. So now you might be thinking, well, Eric, if we're managing the max loss, we should do that for dire and condors, sure, why not? It sucks. What's going on here? Buying these wings is very expensive. So even if you buy the wings, which would then manage your loss side of the equation, and then you apply management on top of that, you perform worse. That is a problem with using winged strategies.

It is going to negatively impact your return potential. In this case with the five delta long options, you would increase the overall profitability of this from 9,600, you would kick it up to 17,000, which is much better. But in the long run, that cost adds over time. None of this includes commissions, which wouldn't identically sway this either way. But the more important function here is the drag that you're adding to your returns. So you have to make choice. As a trader, you have to determine what function you're providing the market. If you think that you just get to sell options and you should just make money because you're selling, but then you want to buy wings to protect your position, you can do that.

And as you add taking a max profit, you'll notice the PNL on most of these decreases in efficacy. But if you're interested in seeing that, we could do another video that dives deep into this. So now let's talk about real quick, the application of this. What does all this mean? First thing, you have to define what your risk tolerance is, what market function are you performing? Then after you define that, you have to figure out what kind of trades fit your risk tolerance, understanding the trade offs there of. And again, especially for zero DTE trades where we don't experience overnight gap risk, I tend to be on this side. You want to interact with the positions as little as possible to reduce your cost. Overall, that is a killer. Again, that video I referenced earlier will dive deep into detail on how dangerous that can be. The cool part is you can optimize these even more considering 2022, which was an aggressive down year. So we don't have to cherry pick the results to create the outcome that we want",

    "text": "that video I referenced earlier will dive deep into detail on how dangerous that can be. The cool part is you can optimize these even more considering 2022, which was an aggressive down year. So we don't have to cherry pick the results to create the outcome that we want that's in sample and out of sample, kind of making a combination of a statistical process. But you can come up with a pretty simple rule set when it comes to the X levels, SPX levels or trend to determine when you choose to enter versus when you choose not to enter. But without any of that, you still have strategies here that are double digit compound annual growth rates that survived during a pretty massive drawdown in 22 and performed just fine during the subsequent market rally in 23. Any questions? Let me know what should I test next? Throw it in the comments below. Like, subscribe, be an outlier. I'll see you guys later.",
