    "text": "Hey everybody, Eric here. I was lucky enough to randomly find Matt on Twitter and I actually look through your stuff a little bit like I was just telling you and I love a lot of what you talk about and you have an interesting background. So first off, welcome to the channel. Thank you. Thanks for having me. It's a pleasure. Yeah, and I'm really looking forward to the conversation. So I figured as always, it's really helpful to just start with a little bit of level setting. Maybe get a little bit of your background. You gave me a little bit of a preamble, but I would love to understand two main things. The first one is how did you get started in trading or investing kind of whichever you more closely identify with? I think it's trading, but we'll see. And then the second one is just walk me through kind of an evolution from that start to where you are now. Okay, thanks. Well, you know, so first of all, I'm just happy to be on your, you know, marine veteran, like I was saying before we started the call, I always respect people that such passion and work so hard. That's I think that's key for success in anything that you got to do in life. And I think the Marines probably represent that better than anything else out there. So so just a bit of my background. My dad, you know, he kind of",

I think I was eight or nine years old because we used to drive to Florida every year in the summertime. And I just stopped when these nice my dad said, well, if you like it, buy buy some shares. So I bought five and I kept track of the three years. But really, what really kind of got me really into the markets was I think I was maybe 16. I forget now exactly, but I read how to make money and stocks by Willie Moniel. And that that book kind of like blew me away.

I just found it so interesting that because you know, especially when you first approached the market, your only question is, you know, when do I buy, when or what do I buy? And to see on a chart, which I'd never seen a stock chart before that that book, to say like, you know, if you draw a trend line here, if this past this point, this is where you buy and then this stock went up 200 percent, it was like, wow, that's how you know, that is the secret for the markets.

And I was asked to come back to be a finance professor for university graduates. So, funnily enough, I was probably a year older than most people in the class and I was teaching that class. And it's still being taught today. Actually, I don't teach it anymore, but it's still that's a very popular course. And well, you know, long story short, I became a chartered financial analyst in 2020. I joined the US investing championship where I gained a little bit of popularity. And today I still invest for myself and have my website, the Kuroso Insights. Awesome. So, it's funny, like I just really identify with how you got started.

So, when you started finding this draw to technical analysis, what was your initial impression towards it? And the reason why I'm asking that specific question is my background is very limited technical analysis. I use some of it, but it's definitely a bit of a balance of technical, fundamental, and then a lot of just options data. So, I'm really curious when you were looking at or reading the book, maybe that's, you know, really where it hit for you. But what drew you to technical analysis over the value investing that your dad was doing? Was it simply the chart or what was it? Well, you know, most of the books at that time for technical analysis were mostly futures, guys, commodity, guys. Because in the 80s and 90s, I think the reason the technical analysis was like in the realm of commodity futures trading, not for stocks. Stocks was the respectable place where you looked at financial statements and that was what you looked at. But, you know, I think when you're a",

And when you look in your bank account and you have like 500, you say, yeah, I got to do all this work for 50. But so when I saw what Bill and Neil was talking about in his book, and the first thing he mentions is about controlling your risk. And so it just kind of dawned on to me, you know, how do you control your risk unless you can time your entry, even at a young age that, you know, made a lot of sense to me.

And my supervisor said, you know, on the kids, it was like one of those keyboard driven entry systems was like F1 is by F4SL, F3 is short, you know, make us money. And that was really pretty much all I had in terms of trading. You know, so the only training I got was really when a colleague next to me, you know, saw, you know, it was, was, you know, saying, Hey, Matt, why don't you try this? You saw me do all these charting and stuff. And you showed me the kind of the simpler methods they were doing the market making methods. And no one ever puts that in a book because it's such minute detailed information. Right. And they're in quite a bit there. So, but but in general, that was that was day one. It was like, this is by cell. And, you know, let's see at the end of the month, how you do. Yeah, I get to clicking guy. Yeah, yeah, pretty much.

So just the importance of the short-term mechanics. And it's an important part of the toolbox to be able to control that even that short-term risk for long-term returns. A second item I would, I would really say, is very important is, is you get to read the buying and selling pressure, the buying and selling in Canada, we can also see the broker number so you could really read the data better. And luckily, I started before Algos were there, the HFTs, the rather. Yep. So I really saw the impact of institutional investors. It was, it was much clearer.

I was blown away that they were still trying to teach that stuff. So I'm really curious what your experience was like, you know, creating materials and whatnot and just what the students were like. So I was kind of fortunate with the school reached out to me that it was a class that was like loosely based on technical analysis. I didn't get the outline of it, but it was kind of that professors own take on things. And they said, look, you're the president of the CSTA, and we'd like you to make a class. So I'm a CMT charter holder. And so I reached out to the CMT association. They had any kind of tools and they actually had this program, the MTA educational foundation where they actually help, you know, professors get up and run. So they had the kind of curriculum. So I kind of took that and that was probably 90 of what I used to, is basically the CMT program, like level one, was probably 80 to 90 of what I taught. And then on top of that, you know, so the name of the class was how to build a profitable trading system. Oh, cool. So I took basically all these technical tools, but we had access to Bloombergs and stuff like that",

To be honest, it's funny. Like it was a very laid back experience. As long as you made money, you could pretty much do whatever you wanted. As long as you were making money and almost every every day, week, month, I was making money. It was a fairly, at that time, it was a very consistent type of strategy. Yeah.

So there's really three basic things that I'll work with to go to cash. One is your own positions, how they're acting. So because I came into the year without any positions, I had like, I had one really good trade early in the year. I think I, I mean, like brought my account up 20, but I close that out. And then all the new trades I initiated started to break down. And then, but rather initiate new trades, you know, William O'Neill tracks what he called distribution day. So he looks at the market index to see if there's, you know, increase selling on down days to see if there's a shift of what institutions are doing. And that was picking up at the same time. I look at, yeah, I don't want to get too technical. But each day, there's a number of stocks making new highs, 52 week highs, a number of stocks make new 52 week lows.

I think the main reason for me is it's always appealed to me what's called the asymmetry, you know, so, you know, on the upside, you could have a 5 loss is where you see, look, I'll get out, but I have a stock that can potentially go 50, 100, 200.

So what kind of other than the Fed's statements, what technical tools were you looking at that started making you comfortable with like your reentry post COVID? So when the Fed statement came out, I always use the technical side to confirm my bigger thoughts. So I'm just a natural, I guess, strategist. So you know, even when I was, even I was day trading, I was always reading like macro news or company news, but, but, you know, I always use the technicals to confirm whatever my thoughts are because you can have this great idea and be totally wrong. And it's such a, it could be such a a well-argumented argument. I mean, if you go online, you read some stuff on different websites and they say, wow, this guy is, he's thought of everything and then he's dead wrong. You know, so I find the market will always surprise you. So even though all that came out by the Fed, I was waiting for the fall through day, which again, William O'Neill teaches in his book, a very simple concept. Basically, what he looks for is, you know, the first two or three days after market bottom, you can't really look at those to confirm a new uptrend because that could be short covering. Just people can't say I got to get out. But starting on the fourth day or later, if you",

So when I saw all that Fed news, I was really waiting for that fall through day or net new highs to come out. When I got the fall through day, at that same time, I saw all these great setups and these, again, these stocks that would benefit from stay at home and it was like the perfect textbook setup.

You're in this championship, you know, markets going to hell, you decided to go to cash. How did that feel?

But at the end of the day, if you mess up, you're still going to be able to eat that night. You're still going to get paid, you know, and for myself, when I'm trading for a living, you know, the first of all, there's a higher tax rate because now this is your income, right? So you have higher tax rate, which is against you. Your capital, you can't use for other things in life using it for this. And if you go into drawdown, every time you go into drawdown, that's less buying power to make more money in the future. That impacts all your future income. And then on top of that, you have your living expenses that come out of your trading. So there's a lot of hurdles and a lot of pressures that you have trading for a living that don't exist when you're trading part time. So maybe just because I'm used to that. And so in the championship, I just, you know, it's just like, look, this again, discipline, execute your strategy, even though other people are doing whatever they're doing, be diligent, be disciplined. And because again, I can't risk blowing up everything just for a championship. But there's really that a really big difference between trading pro and trading as a side business,",

So, you know, during the COVID drop for me as a retail trader, I literally couldn't have cared less zero difference. Like, you know, I had some positions that were hurt and real bad.

And then the other thing that that you were saying that really resonated with me was just the the concept I haven't met a successful trader that's been in the business for a longer a decade that isn't disciplined. I haven't found one. I found a couple that were really lucky early on and then they stopped, which you can consider that discipline of some sort. But, you know, I've met some people like that that just hit a good bankroll early on and then switched to long-term investing and, you know, let that sit. But I haven't met an active trader that's been at it longer a decade that hasn't learned discipline and the ability to follow a plan.

Well, in what sense? I mean, I'm curious. So to just give, you know, for the for anybody that's listening that may not be familiar, essentially dark pools are a way for large institutions to send block trades through. And obviously they'll have a pretty significant impact if they were traded on the open market. It may not be able to get a full fill, prices be all over the place, all that kind of stuff. But one of the main benefits to dark pools is a little bit of obscurity and, you know, movement. And I'm curious when you're going through using institutions, it seems institutional volume is like part of your information data gathering, these decisions off of how do do dark pools, you know, factor into that at all, or since they're not traded on the open market, are they things that exist, you know, they exist, but they don't necessarily impact your deployment as a trader. From myself personally, I don't think it really impacts what I'm doing. That's really, I think the biggest impact there is if you're a very short-term trader, like what I was doing, market-making, pro-training, there's more of an impact significant.

So, that's kind of the two sides of what I'm probably doing, typically. Got it. Okay. And to start with just the risk understanding first, when you find a stock that you're interested in, what is your general approach to deciding how you're going to manage risk in it? So, the way I've developed my strategy over the years, the way I deploy my risk now is every trade has the same risk all the time. My position is standard. Regardless of the charter, the volatility, I have a fixed maximum loss that I'll take. That's a fixed amount of my account. And I'll build my position over time.

If I have a third of my account in a stock, I don't want to do that day one, because if I do day one and they announce, you know, we expect sales, you know, sometimes there's an early announcement, sales are going to be a little lower than we expect that we open down 20, I'm going to get hit",

Do you start at the portfolio or do you typically start by looking at the market and seeing what opportunities are there? So portfolio wise, obviously, I'm a trader, so I always want to be like 200 invested, right? But so it's I have to always hold myself back. So I usually use the market in general, like the way I look at new highs and you lows to kind of gauge my exposure. I have some rules for, you know, should I be fully invested?

So I have kind of a technical gauge just to keep me on the road instead of being too off of what the market's telling me. But that's kind of like my big picture idea, but typically what I do is I run a lot of scans to find which stocks have the biggest growth numbers fundamentally that of those I want to see which are performing the best technically. And then the market telling you the story, right? So for example, let's say, I don't know, let's think of a company like, or let's go back to we were talking 2020, you know, like this company Lavango has 200 earnings growth and it's 5 from its 52 week high. Well, okay, something's going on. The company's obviously doing it fantastically fundamentally. The market's recognizing that because it's paying up, it's at 52 week highs. What is going on? So then that's why I like to dive into the story of the company. You can go to vestrelation website, CEO, read online. And okay, this is what they're doing. And when you do that enough times, eventually, you know, no company is like an island. You know, if someone wants to do something, it's usually just a slightly better iteration of something else someone's already done.",

And so then after once once you see that, you start to build a picture of, will this scale? Who else is going to benefit? And once you build that idea and then after these other companies that you thought would have benefited start coming and now they have huge monster growth and they're sitting at 52 week highs.

So it's got a worker. It's got to go. Yeah. So when you're looking at fundamentals, it sounds like you're looking at kind of the very, I don't want to say stereotypical, but like just common, common concepts, like making sure that we're generating cash is somehow via earnings per share metrics or revenue, whatever. Just some sort of valuation metrics there. Are there any other like really fundamental tools that you like to integrate when you're looking at these stocks? I think, you know, if you boil it down and you know, you can go into academic papers and people can argue this way that way, but you know, earnings are what investors are going to pay for.

So typically, the earnings will be present, they'll be booming. The rare exception, that won't be the case, but then at least sales are going to be booming, right? So I mean, you can, you can say I'll postpone earnings, but you better be at least selling the product and you get the earnings later when you can, when you have more pricing power or whatever it is, you know, so those are the two factors I look at either, you know, record earnings or at least the highest earnings at the past eight or 10 years or at least record sales or the highest sales of the past eight to 10 years, but growing aggressively.

If you can find companies that are doing that, and if you're growing aggressively, your stock price is going to advance aggressively.

When I always feel like retail traders, fuck it up for themselves because when you look at like the behavior of even there's a couple white papers that I really like. One of them is individual investor behavior and it was by the university, California, Berkeley. And it talked about the propensity for retail traders to let losers run and cut winner short. Literally, they have the idea that you do, but they don't have the discipline to make it happen. What was, I don't know, your approach to allow, I always feel like cutting losers, you know, it's, it's difficult, but once you get used to it, it is what it is. It's part of the business. But I find when I talk to people, one of the more difficult components, when we, once we get the risk under control is letting winners move. How do you arrive at that? Like what's your approach to letting some of these trades run, you know, 30, 50, 100, you know, whatever you're seeing, how do you, you know, force yourself to keep your hands out of it and say, nope, I'm going to let this run.

This is my strategy. And it's hard because for example, in 2020, LaVongo was my best, my best trade and that was up about 400. So when you're already up 100 to, to let it ride and you have 200, it's very hard, but, you know, I was, and this concept you bring up is as old as investing is because if you read the book, reminisces of a stock operator, I don't think I've ever read that book. Jesse Livermore, that's written in 1927. And he's saying that, you know, men should, should fear when they hope, and they should hope when they fear, which is, yeah, people do the, because I think it's just that human nature of, it's going to come back. And when you're making money, oh, no, I'm scared, I'm losing my profit. It's just, it's weird psychological, you know, block that almost most people have. Yeah. And another, another part of it is that people don't like to be wrong. So if you're making money and you take your profit, you're right. If you're losing money, but I don't sell, you're not yet wrong. You are wrong. The, Mark, your broker will tell you wrong. The money's gone there, but it feels like you're",

And that's probably why, you know, you look at most traders, even professionals, a lot of them had a period where they blew up.

You know, so what my outlook, if I'm reading the, you know, the market, as I see it now, the Federal Reserve, wanting to raise rates is the elephant in the room. The Federal Reserve is always the elephant. Actually, but, you know, but the thing is, there's, it's rare that the Federal Reserve is making big moves. So 2020 forced their hand and now inflation is forcing their hand again, usually in the mean time between major tightening or losing policies, you kind of don't hear from them very much. So the day it's, you know, day to day is normal. But with them wanting to raise rates aggressively, that's definitely going to put pressure on the market. I mean, you're pulling money out of the market. The lifeblood of the market is money and you're taking money away because you're making money more expensive. But the other side of that coin as well is whenever you raise your lower interest rates, you change which sectors are going to be attractive for institutional investors within the market. That's why you're seeing technology get killed and energy is, and other things are so strong because of inflation and all that. I think those",

The trade I'm most excited about now is probably the oil trade. Oh, interesting. I think, again, this kind of goes back funnily enough, funny enough to my early years where again, resource companies and my global macro perspective. But, you know, so many oil come to really beat up last year, well, now two years ago, 2020, because oil was negative at one point in the March contract. They couldn't find storage for it. So, you know, when you're going to, you know, this is a way I kind of build my overall thesis, right? So when I'm approaching the markets and I always time it technically. So the feds raising rates, that makes companies with current real earnings more attractive. You know, if rates are going up and you're a tech stock promise me earnings 10 years from now, well, as rates are higher, it's more expensive for me to sit there and wait for those earnings. So that's why that attract them. This shifts from high PE lower no earning stocks to lower PE higher. That's why that's the sector switch that the flows will be towards energy, I believe. A second",

That's why that's the sector switch that the flows will be towards energy, I believe. A second reason I like energy is there are in the current oil environment, they're basically printing money. The profits are huge. Some of these companies are making record earnings already. They're very reluctant, especially American, shale producers are very reluctant to put out the more oil rigs to take out more oil rigs. They've got slams so hard. A lot of companies went through a structuring board director says, you're going to be very careful with what capital you put out because we don't know as COVID going to come back. Are they going to, you know, keep putting pressure on oil companies for, you know, climate change or whatever. So you're not going to go out there and put out more drilling unless you're really sure of the demand situation and the rest. Same with the OPEC countries, exact same situation. In fact, with Russia on the Ukrainian border, if there's some kind of a conflict, that would even be more pressure on the oil. So you put all of this together and I think personally, I don't know if you know Peter Lynch, the great investor, fidelity investor. His ethos was always by what you know, by what you",

And so if the world, I think, come out of this unfortunate situation and depending where you are, there's still some rather, you know, big restrictions. If everyone starts driving and flying again, even if it's incrementally, but in that direction, because oil companies and oil producing nations are so restrictive and careful in putting out new supply, your supply equation is very tight for oil. That's why you say, President Biden put oil out with the strategic petroleum reserve. What happened? Oil fell. Whoop, right back up. It was consumed by the markets. So the more that's telling you the market is already very tight. Supply is very tight. And if that demand comes on, even if it's two, three, four, five, six months from now, people say that's it.

Our oil will still start your car, but your dollar, we can't buy the same amount of bread at the store because the dollar has been printed. So they're not as willing to accept lower prices for the oil. So all of this to me provides a backdrop where there's an asymmetric setup on oil. The downsides limited, maybe my idea could be wrong. Maybe we come down a little bit. But if I'm correct in my analysis, can you see a hundred dollar plus oil? Absolutely. Sure. And if the oil companies are already doing great now, well, if oil gets to a hundred plus, they're really going to be killing it. And also, then if you look at higher rates and institutions moving towards these current earnings type companies, now I can see this place where this funnel torrent of money can come in these oil stocks that have been so out of favor for so long.

Who's making 52 week highs? It's not text stocks this year. So the market is agreeing with me and no one's paying attention because oil is no longer sexy, right? It's about supposed to be about green investing and all of that. And so it's kind of abandoned. But when the earnings come, the money will follow. It's just the law of the market. That's how I'm reading the market. I think you're going to see pressure on general markets in general. I think probably growth stocks are going to wash out sometime later this year because it's already year they've topped. I mean, we top basically February 2021 for a lot of growth stocks. But in the meantime, I think the best upside trades probably oil. Beyond that, I think general markets gains are going to be limited just because the Federal Reserve is going to be this big weight on the market. Yeah, I think that's a obviously really comprehensive analysis. I feel like a lot of what we experienced in COVID was an experiment by the Fed. And I think that we don't",

I don't think we're getting rid of oil anytime soon. I think it'll be around for the foreseeable future. But I do feel like they're constantly under fire for something. So I'm just curious, you know, when you discuss your trade hypothesis, what's the kind of time frame that you're thinking about? Yeah, it's usually like 12 months out. Like again, most of my trades are three months to nine months. You know, can they go maybe a year and a half? Sure. But that's the, you know, the rarity, you know, but that's usually like the wheelhouse. I like to focus in because once you start getting beyond nine months or more, even if it is a five year trade, let's let's say you have this great five year vision, you're going to have to sit probably through some some points where three six nine months with a stock consolidate drops hard under performs.

I mean, some of them are even textbook, I mean, technical analysis bases. But there's real specific criteria he provides. So I think that's just so important to start with on a foundation of which stocks to look at. I mean, and it's not just the shape of the pattern. People think, you know, it looks like ahead of shoulders or this or that. There's also depth, you know, requirements that it's got to be a certain length of time. And the way he got to these parameters is he went back to look at all the best stocks as they had their major advances in history. And he looked at the basing patterns to find what are all the commonalities in the minimum criteria because a base, if you're just looking at a technical price action, you could see that on a five minute chart, you could see it on a big chart. But if you're looking for these stocks are going to have these explosive runs after being accumulated by institutions, they have a commonality as to how they form these bases. So that would be step one as to what I do. I think just, you know, people are varying experience and technical analysis. Just something basic like the 50 day moving average. Like keep your stocks above the 50 day moving",

I mean, if you're below there, I mean, you're dealing with a stock that's maybe either in a correction or has already started a downtrend. So just at least above a 50 day. And beyond that, well, the technical tools, there's many that I use, I probably have to show you on a chart. But I think there's no real super secret. I picked the ones over the years that are, I feel are most effective that work best with me for me as well, I would say, but keep a variety. So by that, I mean, some people let's say like an oscillator, some people like short term chart patterns. If you have a variety for different types of situations, not every stock advance will be the same. So for some, sometimes a stock advance is quick and you'll get like a flag pattern because it's a quick pattern. Sometimes a little bit slower and other patterns will show up. So, you know, if you have a larger, you know, a diverse set of tools, you'll be able to capture entries on a variety of type of stock moves. That's the way I would look",

But anyways, he was really big into like super simple, you know, technical analysis. He uses like 150 day moving average, 50 day moving average, and that's about it. So it's, you know, it's funny.

Because it sounds like when you're talking about institutional pricing that, you know, those tools, at least for me, come to come to mind, but I'm curious if that's something that you use for that. It's not, it's not something I use, to be honest. Really, I like to look at the volume on the chart versus what a stock average typically trades in the day, you know, but I never really got beyond that. What I find a very key important tool and that's nothing I created, but you know, if you're buying a stock during the day, that's breaking out or something and these, these kind of more advanced discussion, but, you know, the day is not created equal. So for example, at 10 o'clock in the day, you know, you're only a small fraction, you know, into the day. So if you just kind of say like, oh, you know, let's say we're 10 of the trading day is complete. Are we doing 10 of the volume? That's not a fair analysis.
