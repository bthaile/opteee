    "text": "Ben using chatchipiti to help with options. It's kinda blowing my mind. Same, bro. Same, Mr. Puzzlehead, underscore, water, underscore, eight. Is onto a really fun topic here, which revolves around the use of chatchipiti, specifically AI more broadly in your trading. And I can say unequivocally, it is the biggest game changer. Or retail trader that's come across essentially since electronic trading. It's that big. So the goal of this video is to walk through this post, see what they're seeing, find some cool things, and maybe some gaps in how they're using it. And then at the end of the video, I'm actually going to walk you through a comprehensive grouping of queries, specific queries you can use in your trading career using AI. So let's get right into it. So he starts off by saying that he's using GPT to help them figure out options traits, and saying that it's been really helpful, which completely agree with. He's saying one of the ways that they'll use it is by typing in a strike price expiration, what I pay target price, and it spits out all the math. It tells me how much profit I'd make in different stock prices, my break even, how much I'd lose per one point drop, stuff like that, stuff I should be calculating, but always don't always feel like doing this, is actually the first problem to be honest. It is completely cool that a model can do this, but if this",

It is completely cool that a model can do this, but if this is the end result, don't feel like doing this is a massive problem, because your job as a trader is literally to do this. There's nothing that says that there's anything wrong with using something to assist you, but there's also limitations when you're using something like chatchipiti. So for example, in your price modeling, you're going to have to account for non-linear changes of Greeks, which is what chatchipiti is going to use linear calculations for Greeks. So if you say two days pass, the stock goes up five points, then chatchipiti is just gonna apply linear movements of the Greeks, and it's a simplifying assumption. It's fine to do in a vacuum, but if you're really trying to take trading seriously, you shouldn't be leaning into chatchipiti to do this stuff because you don't feel like doing it, you should lean into it to teach you how to do it, to teach you different ways to think about it, but if it perpetuates this element of it, that's actually net negative added in my opinion. Next, they're saying that they're starting to upload screenshots of full options chains, and they'll say something like, I don't see what they",

I don't see what their prompt was, but here it says, and it actually reads the bit as spreads volume, interest, open interest, IV trends gives back pretty clear answer. Like it will say, this looks like bullish accumulation at the 95 call strike or heavy put volume at the 90, suggest hedging or downside risk. So let's take a look at these. So if we take a look at the 95 call here, and they're saying that they're seeing bullish accumulation. Well, if we take a look at the volume, there's seven contracts, and then if you look at the open interest, there's 514 contracts. Do I as a regular optionist trader, would I consider this bullish accumulation compared to something down here that might have 1069 contracts? Well, probably not, but the other thing is that the volume here is really low. So unless they're looking at some sort of multi-day over-day trend seeing this build out, then it's a different story. So one of the things to keep in mind is when you're using chatchipiti, it will give you inputs and sound super-remly confident, but it will lie directly to you. And I'm not saying",

And I'm not saying that inherently, but this case, there's actually a scenario I'm gonna show you in a few moments that is that for sure. But the other things if we take a look, heavy-put volume at 90 suggests edging or downside risk. So let's go to 90, let's take a look at the put volume. What's the put volume? One. Not heavy at all. So this is the broader point. Now they might be using examples of responses that might give, I would be surprised, instead of just copying and pasting it, it would be easier than typing this out for chatchipiti. So my guess is this is from chatchipiti, and it's wrong, like this is wrong. And there's nothing wrong with giving chatchipiti something like this and saying, hey, like, what do you see here? But again, you have to temper what you're receiving in understanding the models that you're using. So it says it's been weirdly accurate and it helps me avoid sketchy setups or over-priced premiums. This is also tricky, right? Because chatchipiti can't help you with over-priced premiums. There's nothing chatchipiti could tell you to tell you that it premium is over-priced.

Because chatchipiti can't help you with over-priced premiums. There's nothing chatchipiti could tell you to tell you that it premium is over-priced. But reason being is because if you go back to options 101, the only unknown in an option, premium itself is the implied volatility and we implied out. So it's actually the forecast volatility. So unless chatchipiti is providing you with a more accurate, vol number than what the market consensus is, then it's not really helping you. Now one thing you could ask it to do is say, hey, calculate the theoretical value of this option and see what it sets. And if you notice that the bid asks spread is completely off from that theoretical value, then you at least know where you should probably start pinging your trade if you're trying to get in at that point. So over-priced premiums is really, really tricky to identify in this way because it essentially makes the assumption that you can forecast volatility better than the market and some people might say, well, AI can probably do that. I can't. It absolutely cannot. And it's also important to remember from a retail trader lens, AI is not new. It's new to us. We've had it for a few years now and it's growing massively.

I think there's a couple things we can do to tighten this up, but literally anything that helps somebody go from this stage of just guessing to being more practical, that's a win. Especially on longer data trades. Not saying it replaces DD, having a second brain that doesn't miss small stuff. That's correct. Now, this is again tricky, because the second brain component completely agree with but it misses tons of stuff. And again, these are like two great examples right here. It's telling us that the 90 strike has hedging or downside risk because of the heavy put volume. The volume is one. That's not heavy. So again, you still have to be the practical thinking elements of this. All right, so let's take a look at a couple prompts that you can use. Now again, this is geared more so for beginners.

    "text": "is one. That's not heavy. So again, you still have to be the practical thinking elements of this. All right, so let's take a look at a couple prompts that you can use. Now again, this is geared more so for beginners. This is not for your power users. If you're interested in that, we absolutely could do a separate video that really clicks into more heavy utilization of it. This is more so for people that are just looking to get started. So I've broken it down into three buckets. It's not limited to this. This is just a starting point. But things to help you learn, things to help you research, and then things to help you analyze. So you can read these prompts on your own. I'm just gonna grab a couple from each and literally run it through the prompt with you now. So I grab this one. I just learned about XX, give me 25 questions. This is effectively using chatchipT or whatever model you prefer, literally as a learning tool. Now I subscribe to a ton of different models because I find it fascinating. I like learning the differences. ChatchipT is great. And it's like a really solid consistent middle of the road. It's sometimes it'll be really good at something lag and others like right now what I noticed in the model is it's way too friendly, way too agreeable, which is a problem because you want it to be objective.

And it literally builds a quiz based on my specifications that I can run through. And I use a mix of different questions. You can mix up even more if you'd like. And then at the end, you can literally answer all of these. So the way that I would go through and take this test, I would say like one is A, two is A, three is A, like that.

And you're learning about this concept called profit mechanisms, which really takes us into identifying and analyzing specific market effects.
