    "text": "This is an example of a trader who thinks they learn something, but unfortunately they completely miss what they're supposed to learn. They say, agree taught me a very valuable lesson. They've been trading for almost 20 years, they started with 25K consistently made 500 a day, then they would exit 2 return on a Vesic Capital every day that they do choose to trade, which isn't every day. It says it's not much, but it's adding up made a mistake, what my account trying to go for more lesson learns to stop when you met your goal. Even if it's 5 10,000 take the win, shut it down, greed gets you nowhere. I'm basically back to my initial 25K, still motivated. I'm fine with 500 each day I trade. Here's the problem. This person has smoked crack cocaine and has the most contorted skewed perception of reality that I could conceive of. Let's talk about it. If we looked at their first scenario of 25K making that 2 500 bucks, that places them at a 14,597.5 return. That doesn't seem pretty reasonable to me. Let's give them the benefit of the doubt, because they say that they don't trade every day. What happens if they do this each week? That's still a 180 return. So unfortunately, this trader believes that they've learned about greed. The funny thing is, is that this isn't actually about greed at all. This is about having completely false expectations of what trading is, what's",

The funny thing is, is that this isn't actually about greed at all. This is about having completely false expectations of what trading is, what's possible. And this is just utter lack of planning. That's all. You can see I just threw it in a calculator that took me 20 seconds to build. And you can see that even this, I'm fine with 500 each day I trade. This is crazy. They're fine with a 14,000 return, even if they change this to each week I trade. That's 180 return. So this is simply a function of somebody who hasn't done any requisite research before they start trying to do this. And they set themselves up for failure. Be an outlier see you later.",
