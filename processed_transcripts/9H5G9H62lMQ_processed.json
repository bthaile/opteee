    "text": "what's up outliers welcome to outlier trading tips where in five minutes or less you will have some knowledge to walk away with today we're going to talk about whether or not options are zero sum this is actually a really important conversation specifically not for the pedantic side of things but for the implications and you'll see what I'm talking about so what is a zero Su system it's a situation in which whatever one entity gain another entity loses so if we think about options in that context let's start with a scenario if I buy a call and the stock goes up the seller loses money so we can visualize this if we go into the platform and we take a look at the selling side of a call they obviously will have lost money so let's now take a look at the implication of a zero sum game the reason why Zero Sum games are so important in the context of their implication is because especially in markets where we're interacting with a lot of really smart entities with a lot of information and a lot of powerful resources if we are playing a true zero sum game then we would be led to believe that the other side of our trade no knows something that we don't otherwise why would they sell the option to us so let's take for example if I knew stock XYZ was going to go up tomorrow I knew it",
