You and I have, you know, known each other for a while now. I always love getting a chance to pick your brain, talk about markets and whatnot. So first off, welcome on Stoke to Have You Here, man. Dude, you are the outlier. So I'm stoked to be on it. Come on now. You know, I feel like somebody was telling me about this thing of like manifestation, which it's always been so weird to me, right? To like just think of something and then all of a sudden it happens and I've tried it and it's not fucking working. So maybe I need a manifest harder and then I can become like an actual outlier and be like one of these dudes with a 200 million yacht. But you know, we're working on it. At least we'll talk about it. I'm trying to manifest a credit event if you haven't noticed it. This is not been working apparently either on my end. I guess that's actually like really true. I'm laughing pretty hard at that because if I look back across your Twitter feed, it is filled with said what a great spot to start. So for the people at least from my audience that might not be familiar with your, I don't want to call it an obsession,",

What is the thesis behind this? Because for those that don't know, I've actually read pretty much all of your white papers and the stuff that you think about, it's not like a lot of people speak in hyperbole for attention, right? And you get it, you know, there's always some showmanship. But when I read through your stuff, it's like very clear that you were connecting dots. Talk to me about the credit event. No, no, and well, and the showmanship and loudness on X is obviously not like the real professional stuff that I put out there. I mean, look, first of all, it's funny because people forget that I was bullish at the start of the year. I was saying melt up. There was a whole thread I pointed out, January 13. I said melt up or crash and yes, was the answer in putting the post. I said that Fin Twitt can't understand path. I believe we see both this year, right?

So I was saying, you're going to have a melt up because it's pre-election years, but towards the end of the year, there would be a heightened risk of a credit event, which, you know, would be in response to the lag the facts of the fastest, greatest rate hike cycle in history. Okay, now, I think I've been right and wrong as is the case with most things in the way that it's played out. You did have a melt up, but only in large cap tech. So you can say, okay, that was right. You did not have a melt up and everything else. The SP 493, small caps, retailers, Europe, emerging markets. There's been no melt up outside of those large cap names. So I'd say that I was actually very wrong in that melt up argument. And the whole melt up argument at the start of the year was it's pre-election year. Pre-election years are factually historically the strongest of the cycle. Now, let's talk about the credit event. Credit event is not some scary term. Credit event just means a VIX spike. That's all it is. So when you look at the VIX volatility index and you overlay credit spreads, you tend to see those are one for one relationship, meaning as the VIX spikes, credit spreads tend",

VALTODY is seen by the bond market as increasing de-falt risk. So yeah, part of the thesis was at some point the lag defects would kick in the Fed likely over Titans, which by the way, now, long-gravation yields are telling you that they did, which we can maybe touch on in the last several weeks here. Instead, you ended up having a credit event in Treasuries, which I then changed my tune and saying that's phase one, but a corporate credit event phase two is not yet happened. I thought it would start entering November. Now, the reason I said at the end of October that the first week in November, you could see circuit breakers, which I was able to say was way wrong on, right, was credit spreads were starting to widen. Okay, the VIX was at a point in the exact 21. It was at the point where it's like, it was going to break out and spike. It's around this level.

And then you had this drift and everyone's super bold up, right? But I don't think the credit event risk has gone away. Maybe my timing, not maybe obviously my timing has been off in putting a spotlight on it for entry November. But we don't know where these legs actually start to impact the economy in the stock market. I mean, you're already seeing now in housing. You're starting to see the housing side break down finally on home sales and pricing. But to say that just because it hasn't happened in a single month, which I thought was higher risk, that the risk is still not there to me as silly. Because the thesis has not changed. There are lags. We went through the faster rate cycle in history. At some point that will manifest the manifestation, probably manifest in an ugly way. But path matters more than prediction. I've been wrong. Having that silly made money or lost money, or I should say, on that, because if you were in treasuries the last month, you'd be great. Treasuries would have been the credit",

Having that silly made money or lost money, or I should say, on that, because if you were in treasuries the last month, you'd be great. Treasuries would have been the credit event way to trade it anyway. So it's fine. But it just goes to show you how this is a business where it's a fine line between being wrong and being early. Yeah. Well, and I also think it's interesting that you look a lot at path dependency because I find in markets, I have a stats background. And I spend a lot of time looking at these things as well, because I find them interesting. And sometimes I feel like the path can be misleading when it's overlaid with some of these unnatural add-ons, specifically like you're talking about a lot of the feds actions, which I've always been so curious how to even think about that. Because we've never seen anything like this before. So it's like how can you think about applying typical path dependency into this kind of environment? How do you think about that when there's like truly anomalous conditions like this? No, no, no, and actually you're hitting on why I just, the reality is nobody knows.

But one thing is that I can say for certain is that it's not certain, right? And that's sort of the mindset. It is funny to me, the I get all this anger and hatred for pointing out people say you're a perma bearer, it's like no, again, if you have an IQ greater than 80, you can see that a funny time has been bullish in the past. But unless the thesis has changed and the thesis has always been around the legs, I guess the magnitude of the rate hike, I still think the risk is there. The fact that so many people seem to think it's not just because it didn't happen in November, which was a monster month, which by the way, plenty of bear markets have monster months.

You're still in the drawdown for the Nasdaq, you're still in the drawdown for small cash, still in the drawdown for the SP. Okay, but what about inflation? Right? I mean, that prior peak for the Dow for the SP for the Nasdaq from 2021, it's not in nominal terms. What's the real level, the after inflation level? You still need, like another 12 from here for the Nasdaq to technically be at the real after inflation at just the high from 2021. I'm not saying it can happen. I'm just saying for all intents and purposes, we're still in the drawdown because still being a bear market.

And if I'm right, that the credit event is still out there that we're still in a bear market, it's going to frustrate the help a lot of people and that's what stocks do. That I couldn't agree more with. So thinking about the credit event possibility still, the way that things have been folded thus far, what are the primary catalysts that you see on the horizon that could kind of capitulate us down that route? So there really are like a legit number of catalysts, right? I mean, ones that have been talked bad and ones that are not getting as much attention. So obviously, there's the commercial real estate side of things. I don't think it's going to be as big of a catalyst because that's not all at once. China could still be a catalyst with the real estate crash that's going on there. Our own housing market could be a catalyst, right?

Well, you go, mortgage is about 5, you're going to have people selling, you're going to have 5 they're going to sell. They're going to unleash because the reality is, yeah, they're locked into their home, which means they're also locked into home insurance rates. Like that's going up. You can see that with the storage on Florida, right? All these home prices, you know, went through the roof or these property prices went through the roof there. I have this lock-in rate with little rates, but the insurance costs are going through the roof, so it's like, all right, what do you do? I mean, you're going to keep on paying the insurance, you're going to try and sell just because you have a 3 is that enough? So that could be a catalyst.

And I make this point continuously, I do not believe in shorting. I do not believe in going into cash. I do not believe in buying puts. For me, and I've said this as outlined in the papers, the risk off expression is still to be exposed to something on the long-only side, right? And outside of the options market, the way you do that is by either being long gold, which is working, being long treasuries, which is starting to work, being long the dollar, which has worked the longest as a risk off trade, or being long utilities on a relative basis, right?

I don't have conviction in the mile marker, I have conviction in the conditions. Right? The catalyst could be the pebble on the road that nobody sees as they're driving. You're not going to swerve because you can't see that catalyst, but you know that you need to already be slowing down before that pebble hits you.

So even the Fed has said that the wealth effect is most powerful when it comes to housing. Right? I mean, we talk about the stock market and the wealth effect for stocks, but the reality is it's most people's asset is their home. We're privileged to be able to trade and own stocks and to play that game, but the reality is most people don't. Their wealth is their home. Okay, so to the extent that housing appreciates, it makes them feel more confident. They spend more. If housing depreciates and makes them less confident, there's a reverse wealth effect. They start pairing back. Right? You haven't seen that yet because housing is only now starting to roll over. I've been early on that, by the way, I said, because there's a housing is not going to use the word, but as in trouble, obviously I've been wrong on that.

But again, fine line between being wronged early. Plenty of people were wrong in 2006, warning of a great financial crisis. At the housing peak back then, they were wrong until they were right. Right? Which is just two-year-old leg, right? From the 2008. So if housing is going to keep on weakening, if there is going to be this depreciation, yeah, that's going to challenge the consumer. That's going to challenge small caps. It's going to challenge the likelihood of zombie companies, which have high leverage and low margin, to keep up with higher costs of capital because the revenue so I guess challenge as people spend less. That's not a perma bear argument that's causing effects. Right? Now, maybe that doesn't happen. Maybe housing holds or goes sideways. Maybe it's a correction in time. Okay, it's possible. But typically, extremes don't resolve them self-sides. Right? And the appreciation post-COVID in housing is an extreme or an annualized basis. Right? Nationwide. So let's see. I think that is a headwind for a while. Again, maybe it's a catalyst, maybe not. It's not a catalyst in the same way as what you saw in the 2008 financial crisis. But as a catalyst that breaks consumer spirits, yeah, I don't see why not. Do you factor things like",

But I did notice when the banks were reporting, I always like to read through their reports because you get a lot of information and they have a really significant spike in credit write-offs from people defaulting. Do things like that factor into your thesis as well? Are those just kind of just additional supporting metrics that move us further along this path? Yeah, I think it's supporting it goes back to that point with the legs, right? It's like, look, it takes time to change a habit. I mean, you know this yourself, right? I mean, given the CSS you've had in your life and your career. So if it takes time to change habits, consumers don't change their spending habits overnight.

So I think all that is supportive of the idea that yeah, the credit side is straining consumers, right? And again, it maybe it doesn't resolve itself in an event. Maybe it's just a long drawn out, you know, pressure problem for the economy, but to deny the cause and effect of rates on consumer spending. And by the way, on retailer stocks which have been telling you for the entire year, consumers are strained for all the narratives around how strong the consumer is, tell me why retailer stocks have gone sideways in a pre-election you. Tell me why small cash which are more sensitive to domestic economy have gone sideways. I get the regional bank, you know, effective.

It's not an expansion phase. It doesn't have to be, it's not every time, but this is game of probabilities. So volatility should be increasing. Dillon Quixie are the first step to that. Did you see Powell statements today when he was talking about he doesn't necessarily, he thinks it's, I don't want to misquote him too bad, but the paraphrase was that it's too early to say that hikes are gone. What did you make of that?

Because if the stock market keeps pushing higher, it will delay the disinflation that comes from housing. So one of the arguments for why I think housing has been stubborn on the upside is because a lot of people saying, okay, yes, the mortgage rates have been present. That's fine, but I got in video. Like they view their stock portfolio as something that can help pay off those mortgage, higher mortgage payments. So I suspect that Powell does not want to see the stock market in a enormous melt of phase because that's going to cause all kinds of other liquidity and flationary pressure and then cause them to have to hike rates again. So I do think it's a game of trying to just manage expectation on his end. Now to your point about the bond market saying he's full of shit. Of course he's full of shit. Of course he's full of shit. He's full of shit because he can't tell the future better than nobody else. I mean, if you look at headlines of Fed projections for hikes in 2018 to 2019, they were expecting four hikes and then they ended",

I mean, if you look at headlines of Fed projections for hikes in 2018 to 2019, they were expecting four hikes and then they ended up cutting instead. It's like the Fed doesn't know what's going to happen next either. But and the Fed is a follow. I always go back to that point. The Fed doesn't own the bond market. The bond market owns the Fed. The fact that the long duration side is acting like this. Okay, yes, it's over. It was oversold. Yes, it was due to bounce. Right. And I stress that long duration trade finally kicking in the Phoenix rising idea of the flight to safety has not happened yet because credit spreads haven't widened yet. But it does seem like the long duration side is saying the Fed definitely over tightened, which means that he can say that they're not done hiking rates. But at the end of the day, the Fed is the bond market's bitch. I'd say that way, but that's just the truth. The long duration size of it. Right. Before we move on from the credit event, there is somebody in the chat from the Twitter space that was saying, can you share two to three concrete examples of what a literal credit event would look like? So any VIX spike, I'd say above 30,",

And then VIX and then OAS, Fred VIX OS, those three terms, I think is the first link that shows up. You'll see that chart that overlays the VIX against credit spreads and then the shaded areas of recession. And you'll see, again, there's a one for one relationship. Right. So you know, it's like if you're going to be mathematical about it, it's literally just just that, right.

You had a brief look like a little bit like a credit event in November, December 2018.

    "text": "You know, to save treasuries, you have to crash stocks. Right. And people seeing the treasury move the last month, they're saying, Oh, obviously, it shows you wrong. No, it doesn't because the top 1 of the clients on using daily data for the SP treasuries are positive in the biggest decline for stocks. I mean, it's just fact. So if I'm right about that VIX spike that credits bread wide name, which is still to come, okay, then you know what? Yeah, you're going to see some really interesting movement in defensive areas in advance because those tend to move prior to that occurring. And you're going to see junk debt breakdown, which would be a great opportunity to buy into junk debt. Like, I want to see a credit event selfishly, not just because, you know, Candle for my own funds, they're designed to play the flight to safety trade in treasuries, which is an idea. The credit event is kind of needed for that to kind of get shot back into place. But I want to buy cheaper levels on the risk on side who wouldn't. I don't know. I am bluntly, it's like, if you're a real investor, you want a credit event. Because times under your sign, you want to buy cheaper. It's not going to stay down. I never said it would stay down. A promo bear would say it would stay down. It's not. So there's a couple of things that I wanted",

A promo bear would say it would stay down. It's not. So there's a couple of things that I wanted to ask you about. The first one is a personal curiosity. Have you, because I know that you study a lot of relationships. I've never studied this one. I've studied tons, but I've never studied this one. Have you found any correlation between when Christmas displays come out and the performance of that company? No, although it's not easy. I I interviewed Jeff Mackey, who used to be on CBCL Adi's now covering a lot of stuff on retailer. I'm trying to remember the exact thing, but he mentioned something along those lines where there's a strong correlation between sales related to garden Christmas items. I think it was like display items for the front yard and future retail sales into the holidays. It's basically the idea is that if you end up seeing people not buying a lot of things, like lights and all these things for the front yard, that's actually a harbinger of negativity. So I don't know if that's I haven't studied it from the perspective you're asking, but it kind of reminds me a little bit of that. But is it you saw on that up here? It's now. No, I haven't. That's why I'm",

I'm working on a handful of other ones from this past year on different anomalies. So like I'm trying to outsource some of these questions I have. So it wouldn't surprise me if there's some effect that is like going out is, look, Phomo is always about sentiment. Sentiment's always more than just chart. That's why seasonality is a thing. That's why even moon cycles are a thing. It's ultimately about mood. So I am sure there's probably something there. Whether it's trailer or not, I have no idea. I don't know, man. I'll give you one which I think is just more anecdotal interesting. Somebody turned me on to this app team. It's like this number one app on the iPhone. It's there's tagline. I think it's something like shop like a billionaire. Basically it's like all goods from China and just basically unbelievably cheap, stupid pricing. It's like the number one thing. Everyone's just buying things left and right. I mean a lot of this self look kind of junky to me, but whatever. That's fine. It's just a way to get very cheap items. And it's like,",

They were at a point now where consumers are just so desperate for anything that's cheap because they probably can't afford very much with inflation and with credit card rates and credit card balances. Like that to me is actually an interesting contrarian signal that you have so much demand for this, you know, T-MU app and these types of products because they're just people are desperate to have something because they can't afford anymore. It's just going to the prior alternatives like Walmart Amazon to get their stuff. Isn't it pretty crazy? I was just talking with my wife about this not too long ago though. How insanely good consumers tend to have it now where if you want to buy something, you literally can just go on Amazon and grab it and have it sent to you in a couple days. Or if you want somebody to go get your food, there's door dash. It's like I feel like the average person literally lives like a fucking king or queen at this point compared to what it used to be.

It's like I feel like the average person literally lives like a fucking king or queen at this point compared to what it used to be. Just what you're talking about with T-MU is making me think of that because there's people that can just buy cheaper goods directly from China across the fucking globe now and have it shipped over which is pretty sick. Yeah, yeah. And I'm going to say on that it's like people also underestimate how that convenience has a price in terms of their discretionary budget. It's like oh yeah, should I just press this on a scar? I mean, it's like what what's the mark on the percentage? As opposed to just taking a walk down the block and buying it, you're just having it delivered to my point. It's like we're so used to these luxuries but these luxuries still have a cost to them, which only furthers the strain on consumer budgets at some point. But they're so used to now ordering and taking advantage of those luxuries that it's hard for them to walk away. They'd rather just be in more debt. I could not agree with that more. I was actually just thinking about that before when I was thinking about going to the grocery store and like I literally use Instacart and I was just like I remember thinking like oh, I'll just order it",

So I'm a big fan of it. I think it's I think it's not health advice, but I think people should learn more about it. I didn't learn no that much about it myself until I started doing it. And that's one of those things where the targeted ads on X actually worked because for whatever reason I started seeing ads on intermittent fasting, I was like, all right, let me look into it. So watching some YouTube videos is in podcasts. At going back to the point, simplest answers, the right one. Just don't eat. And you know that's yourself, right? I mean, I'm sure as the day goes on once you have that one meal, you get really focused. You get this kind of like superhuman abilities. It just really be centered in terms of whatever you want to do. And it's true that the more you eat, the more you get distracted. Right. And there's a by there's a lot of reason for that. You go back to our ancestors. It's like, all right, if you didn't eat for a while and you were caveman, your body said you better go out and hunt.

But one of the things I find really fulfilling with any sort of like physical endeavor is that once you can literally force your comfort, seeking sign of your mind into submission to literally submit to your will, it's actually very powerful because you start to realize how frequently on a day to day basis, you are just acting off of subconscious impulses because your body is trying to offload as much thought as possible. Atomic habits goes into a lot of this, which is a great book by James Clear. But yeah, I'm actually really stoked for you because I think there's a lot of great things that come out of that. And then I mean, working out just for resilience, like literally just you don't have to be like super strong or anything if you don't want to be just for general resilience is good.

I've been a retail trader of my whole life. So I am completely ignorant to that world. When you are deciding your funds, did you have a thought that yes, I'm going to make this fund and this fund or is it more of a, oh, this one seems like a good idea. And then it sprouts the next idea and like so. Yeah, so good question. So ideally, this is now from the business side of things, right? I'm an entrepreneur, right? And I did launch my funds at these acro time because the cycle didn't favor the risk off after you set up treasuries the last two years. The idea is you want to build a fund family, right?

If you're an entrepreneur, you ideally want to have a diversified number of funds because the reality is going back to you can't control the cycle. All right, you want to ideally have, I hate to say it this way, but it's truth. You always want to have something that can sell. That's just the reality. I mean, something that is likely to perform well while other things are maybe not performing as well. You're trying to build, you're trying to get assets, you're trying to get people to pay attention. That's what all these fun complexes do. They have multiple funds and a cycle doesn't favor one asset class, but the other asset class works. Okay, so I want to, I always want to build out a fund family. The commonality of all the funds is that they all rely on treasuries, right? Which you can argue with my critical flaw in the development, but it's all for good reason based on the hindsight data of how treasuries tend to act, right? Against activities. But the signaling actually tends to be different. So I designed the other funds to have a correlation that's fairly low against each other. So I've got my Mutevon attacks, my 2TS for Roro and Jojo. On the indices for Roro and Jojo against the attacks, look at the fuller history, the correlation when I ran it",

    "text": "different. So I designed the other funds to have a correlation that's fairly low against each other. So I've got my Mutevon attacks, my 2TS for Roro and Jojo. On the indices for Roro and Jojo against the attacks, look at the fuller history, the correlation when I ran it was about 0.33. So I was trying to create a fun family that was inherently risk-on-risk off in content, but actually not that correlated to each other except when you're in the real risk off periods where they would likely all be in treasuries and play defense. It's challenging to bring three funds to market, which have a correlation of 0.333 to each other, at least based on that history, and then be in the one period where they're correlated to each other because again, they rely on treasuries, right? I'm hopeful that it's over, but it was a purposeful decision on mine. Now, I designed all of my strategies to avoid large drawdowns and equities in the risk-on asset by being in treasuries during those drawdowns. I did not avoid, I did not design the funds to avoid drawdowns and treasuries. By the way, that's nearly impossible to try to avoid drawdowns in both systematically, because it almost never happens. That's just fact. Pre-voker, post-voker, it doesn't matter. I can show you the data on that. If I could do that, then I have a perfect strategy because it means we'll never have a drawdown, basically, if you can",

Outgairvis equities. How many lost decades has the SP had as the Nasdaq had? Everything. By the way, Active Strikes has lost decades. I went through a nasty drawdown out of the gate with what happened with Roodle and Joe Joe in particular, because I launched them just before this Treasury nasty bear market started. The signals were right to save risk off, but risk off didn't work. Trishers just didn't work, and it's rules based. Now, I am stupidly optimistic, because I think the cycle is going to come my way.

Even though I haven't had the risk off period, if I get a risk off period, which may still happen in December, we'll see. It will surprise a lot of people, not me, because I know how this can work, but fear going back to your original question, you think about it from a business perspective. You want to have multiple products that are not correlated to each other on the hope that at least one of them will work. It so happens in the cycle. None of them worked. Now, how did you align that you wanted to stick to long only versus either shorting or using derivatives? Because to me, it does seem like the more pure style hedge, at least, if we want to hedge downside from a long delta portfolio or something like that. How did you think about that? Yeah, so it's interesting to talk to. I would argue that you don't want to have a perfect hedge. A perfect hedge would be what? Perfect hedge would be inverse, my shorting. What's the problem with having a perfect hedge? You're talking about that's perfect.",

    "text": "did you think about that? Yeah, so it's interesting to talk to. I would argue that you don't want to have a perfect hedge. A perfect hedge would be what? Perfect hedge would be inverse, my shorting. What's the problem with having a perfect hedge? You're talking about that's perfect. You know the exact mile marker, something's going to happen, so you take a directional bet. If you do any kind of a long series back test, I don't care what signals you're using. What happens is you will inevitably get a full signal, a type 2 error, meaning your signals have play defense and the market goes higher. If you're in a type 2 error in a full signal and you're short, you lose money one for one. The perfect hedge hits you because your timing was wrong. Same problem with cash, by the way. Why do the studies show that market timing doesn't work using cash? This cash has no momentum. So if you're wrong, the market goes higher, you're missing out. You're not compounding. That's why studies show market timing doesn't work. Versus my goals. Whereas if instead you use an imperfect hedge, which would go back to things which benefit historically from stock market volatility, not direction, volatility, the flight to safety trades of gold, the dollar, utilities, treasuries themselves, you can be wrong in the timing, meaning you could play defense in either one of those four and the market goes higher, but you can",

So it's really the function of, and it's just come from my years of just back testing strategy development in general. The opportunity set with which you express being wrong will matter more than being right. And yeah, you can be really right when you're short and I'm sure a lot of people, I'm sure you included make some good money when you're making a directional bet. But if you're going to try and do that systematically over time, I would argue you're going to eventually have those streaks where that perfect hedge kills you perfectly and you're better off them playing something else. Now, I get it, right? If you had done shorting or cash the last two years, you did way better than playing defense and treasuries obviously because treasuries got killed. But that's an anomaly. It's an outlier to be about outliers, right? That doesn't happen. What we saw with treasuries is a once in a multi-generation move. I'd rather bet that that's going to come back to being a better hedge coming forward than we've ever seen in the last 20 years. Have you considered something like volatility",

Obviously, it's just because you are following and that's that's actually why I find your approach so fascinating to me with like a rules based approach because one of my arguments against retail traders, there's this thing where retail traders say, oh, I want to be mechanical. I want to deploy mechanically. And it's sounds so great, right? It's on super cool. But unfortunately, I genuinely don't believe that that's how that works super well as far as I can tell. So I look at the way that your funds are designed to perform and it is really curious how you handle uncommon events like this. Now, I don't know if you follow much of Naseem's work or just that style of thought where we think uncommon events are actually far more common than we tend to price in. Is that something that you think about with these funds in any capacity going forward? Or do you think that will still normalize? So I'm a big fan of actually Taliban Black Swan and Fulbeir Envisualista. What I would say is like the last two years, I had been the outlier. Like that's just fact. I go back to I don't care how many people on Fin Twit, FinX, social media in the media say anybody could have seen stocks and bonds would lose money. How could you launch funds knowing that that was going to happen? I had somebody",

The outlier was not that stocks and bonds fell. The LLR was how it happened. The path, the interaction that not gone effects to credit spreads.

    "text": "the luxury to step away. You have the luxury to not have a mandate. When you're in the business of investing and your fiduciary and you have a strategy that you hope will be different than every other strategy that's out there and competes against a very crowded mutual fund and ETF space. You can't do that. You're designing something for a particular environment that you may not be in, but at some point will come. Right? So, you don't have to the question, what do you do? Not much. You just have to wait and hope. Now, it's like people say, hope is not a strategy. It's like, no, I just agree. Hope is unequivocally a strategy. If you don't have hope as part of your, as part of the mindset of a strategy, how can you wait for the turn to come your way? Well, it also dismisses the concept of luck if somebody thinks that there's no hope, which, yeah, I would definitely argue against. We're coming up on time here, but I do want to catch you with one more question before we go. Looking back over 2023, a lot of interesting things happen, and I feel like you put out a lot of content that talks about a lot of those events, but I want to pivot us to 2024. Is there anything in particular as we look into the next year that you're interested in or that you think could be an interesting catalyst",

Is there anything in particular as we look into the next year that you're interested in or that you think could be an interesting catalyst or an event to watch? So, I historically, it is true that small caps tend to underperform in pre-election years, not to the extent that we've seen this year, the magnitude, but it's true that pre-election years large caps do tend to outperform small caps. In election years, though, which is what next year is, small caps do tend to outperform large. So, I think from an asset allocation perspective, there is an argument to be made that next year will not be the year of the Magnificent 7, that there will be the year of Smin, small and mid cap. So, it's like, if you're going to play equities, the catch-up trade, which everyone talks about probably does manifest next year. The question becomes the sequence, in other words, does it happen at the start of the year or after some kind of capitulation credit event, which I still think is the more likely near-term scenario? But I think that's probably the real area to kind of pay attention to. It's just that play of the laggards. That's probably going to be the biggest leader. I also think that there will be a lot of demand and money rotating",

That's probably going to be the biggest leader. I also think that there will be a lot of demand and money rotating anyway from a sector perspective into anything that's dividend oriented. So, dividend, as you know, dividend stocks have not done well, on a relative basis, utility has gotten smashed relative to the SP. Why? Because utilities and high dividend paying sector has been competing against the Fed as far as income goes. Same thing with consumer stable, same thing with healthcare, blue shifts. If the Fed is done, which it seems like they are, and if you get any kind of heightened volatility, you would expect that defensive sectors, which are high dividend paying sectors, utility, stable, and out there, probably get some relative strength as well. So there's two trade-ups, right? There's the defensive sector allocation from large cap-side, utility, stable, healthcare, and then there's the cap rotation from a small cap-side, right, which I think both can work. The thing I'm most confident in, which I could be totally wrong on, is that we're probably not going to see this large cap dominance like we've seen. You know, the last year, that that part of this cycle is probably towards the end. It doesn't mean that we're going to all collapse. It just means it's going to be",

You can't beat the SP as an asset, okay, or if it's the only game in town. You want it. You need to have other asset classes leading and outperforming. That's been what's been so maddening about this cycle because it's been old market cap at seven-stocks driving all them. That's not just me saying that, by the way, I talk to financial advisors all day long, that's them saying it. It's like any kind of diversification has sucked this year.

Yeah, I mean, on all the major socials at Leigh Lagerport on X, YouTube, Instagram, leadlagerport.com, also on Substac and then the funds which are separate. I always stress two legal entities, atagfunds.com. With the caveat that the funds have not done well, but there's a... I was back to meaner version is the only thing you can say is close to guaranteed. Nothing's ever guaranteed in markets. The closest thing to a guaranteed, you can argue is meaner version. Now, you can bet where the mean is, where the average is. But it's like, meaner version is a concept that's as old as the Bible. I always go back to this analogy.
