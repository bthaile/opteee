    "text": "The disposition effect is such a common issue for options traders. This is where we enjoy the sensation of closing winning trades off into early. And we allow losing trades to run too far in the hopes that they might turn around. Why does this happen? How do we short-circuit it? Simple. You have a freaking plan. If you take the time to actually research, test, and build a strategy on your own, it completely removes this sensation because you fully understand the path of your trades because you've seen hundreds of them at that point in your testing. So then you're able to simply focus on execution. Take the time to build a plan, your better off for it. Be an outlier seal editor.",
