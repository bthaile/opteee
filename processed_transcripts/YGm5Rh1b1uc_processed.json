    "text": "What's up everyone? Welcome back to the Outlier podcast. I have my friend, Shay from Humboldt Trader. I'll throw a link to all of her stuff in the description below, but we're reconnecting because I was out visiting her in Vancouver a couple months ago for a podcast and really enjoyed the conversation. And I think your approach to markets from what I can tell is really interesting. One of the things I try to do with my podcast is to put different approaches in front of people because one of my stances on trading is such a big component of it is finding something that aligns with you and like your personality and like what makes sense for the way you think about the world and markets. And I think you offer a really cool perspective. So thanks for coming to hang out. Thanks for having me, Eric. It's an honor to be on your podcast. It's a blast. So first of all, I have to ask when the summer kept running out there, when I was in Vancouver, it was gorgeous. Is it still like that or does it start getting like super humid and stuff? It's it's gotten hotter now. But it's doesn't ever get humid here. It's really dry here on the west coast. So it's actually really, really nice out like if you like the beach, if you like a beach weather, like that's this like a perfect time in Vancouver. Oh, that's awesome. Yeah,",

Yeah, when I was out there, I was so stoked with the weather and I was curious if it starts heating up a ton. So speaking of heating up, I you primarily trade small caps or not necessarily like penny stocks or anything like that, but not not large cap. You're primarily like day trading small cap stocks. Is that correct? Actually, in the recent years, I trade more of the mid caps and larger cap stocks. And then I'll dabble into the small caps when I see really good opportunities. Maybe like a couple of times a month. Got it. And just for my understanding, how do you define mid cap? What market cap falls into there? Well, I kind of categorize large cap, mid cap, all together. Anything over a billion market cap, I kind of trade them a certain way. And then anything under I trade it as just small caps. Got it. Yeah. Then I see how you're breaking it down there. And so what do you make of the recent market activity? We've been selling off for a couple days now. How does that impact your approach? Yeah. So this year, at least for me, what's",

How does that impact your approach? Yeah. So this year, at least for me, what's being working really well for me has just been going long on the large cap stocks. So when the markets are selling off, honestly, they should be told it's hard for me to find setups I really want to trade. So the last couple of days, I just kind of been sitting on the sidelines, I scalped here and there really, really short term. But I'm honestly just like, you know, looking and looking and waiting for the right opportunities to get back in. So when the market sells off, I'm just kind of on the sidelines. I don't really short sell large caps that much this year. I got them burnt in the beginning of the year. So that's why even though we have short term pullback, like right now, I'm still just, you know, re-empatients and waiting for the right opportunities. Got it. Yeah. And another question I had with your approach specifically is, what's your methodology for identifying like these market turnovers? Because I imagine you trade typically shorter term time frames. So that's one of the benefits, you know, perceivably in terms of the purpose of day trading, you're supposed to be able to catch these",

So that's one of the benefits, you know, perceivably in terms of the purpose of day trading, you're supposed to be able to catch these kinds of capitulations. What's your approach to doing that? Yeah. So, like you said, the benefit is overnight, we don't have any exposure, unless I'm doing some swing trading. But most of the time I'm day trading and, you know, overnight, I don't really have to worry about anything. So if I wake up, I see everything's gapping down, you know, continuing to sell off like the last two days, I would look at things and wait for maybe two hours to see if there's a reversal to get in. But if not, then, you know, it doesn't really affect me. So that's one of the benefits of day trading. I don't really have to time anything. I see. Yeah. Yeah. The reason why I kind of dove straight into methodology from the jump is just because I thought the market activity's been interesting. And I want to dive more into the way you think about it later. But to take us a couple steps back now, I would love to understand the way that you entered markets. Because when you and I spoke, you'd mention that you've tried a few different things.

So walk me through when you started trading and then kind of a evolution after that. Yeah. I went first kind of learned about what trading is was 10 years ago. I went first graduated from college. And in the beginning, you know, I just wanted like fast money, right? I saw the ads for penny stocks. So back then, my first introduction was like OTC stocks, penny stocks. And we're talking about the stocks are literally two or three cents. So that's my very beginning. I was trying to buy pump and dumps and then eventually learn to short sell the pump and dump stocks. So that's kind of my first introduction. And then gradually, I realized that, you know, small caps and penny stocks, they're kind of extremely cyclical. Stock market is cyclical in nature, but for the smaller cap stocks, even more so. Sometimes the cycles can rotate really fast in the matter of a couple of days or even weeks. So at least in the very beginning, I was a trader, you're supposed to wait for your opportunity. But for beginners, like they think, when I did, I thought so too.",

But next two or three days, I shouldn't have traded at all, but I still kept on trying to make things happen, trying to squeeze water out of rocks and then I'll just lose everything. So that's when I started to think about, okay, maybe I should venture into small sorry mid caps and large cap stocks and kind of learn, you know, a variety of different strategies that I can and four different stocks. So I can have maybe, you know, instead of just one or two approach, I can have a playbook of five or six different strategies to play with depending on the sentiment of the market. I see.

So to be honest, my timing when I was actually trading the penny stocks and the in the small cap stocks in the very beginning, I'll just follow in chat room alerts. Perfect. It's not really trading. So, you know, I'm sure you know, right? I know, I know, but like, you know, you join those chat rooms and I'm literally just waiting for a text alerts. And I'll try to buy the same stocks as whatever the person is trying to tell people to buy and he got in a dollar. I tried to buy the same stock. I got in at 140 and he sold at 150 and then myself was on reason the stocks back down to like 110 or 1. So that's honestly the very beginning stages of my trading career if you even call that career. That brutal. I know, but I feel like it's a hard lesson, but everyone needs to go through that to kind of understand that hey, you kind of need to take this very seriously. Yeah.

Kind of like, you know, a give rich quick scheme. Well, it's funny for a few reasons too, because one of the first things you mentioned was the idea of like fast money. And that is like one of the underpinning features that brings all of us to the markets. That's why I started trading, right? Like all of us start this with this idea of like fast money. And then the longer you you're around the game, the more you realize like, yeah, like you can make a lot of money trading, but I wouldn't call it fast money. It's kind of money that's, you know, earned over time. And then you got it. Then you got to keep it. But yeah, I really commiserate with that. And then the other thing I was laughing about is when you're talking about like the the alert service, funny enough, like I didn't even know what those were. I found out what they were like two years ago, because somebody on my, yeah, somebody, yes, because the way that I trade is completely different. I'm like in a vacuum. I'm just looking at my stuff.

They're like 2,000, 3,000 here and there. So I lost it all. But in the meantime, even though I lost all the money, they were also a couple of times where I actually made money. So that's why I still feel very encouraged that, hey, like it's, it is possible to make money. But maybe I'm just not putting in enough effort to kind of get to kind of understand the process and actually give it like a real shot at trading. I feel I realize that you can make money.

And you know, it's kind of what differentiates a lot of the, you know, the we call them like the sheep or like the followers who just wait for the chat room alerts.

They got playing out my risk along with my watch list before I enter stock. I'm playing out, oh, if I can, you know, if I allow myself to risk 20, you know, in the stock, you have for this one, I have to risk 20, that means I can only take a certain amount of shares. So all of those would brand new to me at the time, but it seems so simple and so easy now. But back then, I think most traders don't know you're supposed to do those things for yourself. Most of you just want to follow and just want to make money right away. Is that doing the real work that's required of them? So you kind of started then saying, okay, I'm late to the punch on these.

One of the parts that fascinates me so much about your path is that you've really still stayed centric on the same timeframes. You said that you swing trade sometimes, but like, you still, it sounds like at that point, it was still mostly day trading focused. Is that correct? Okay. Yes. And what has led you to really focus on day trading still up until this point? We've started with looking for fast money. We started with small stocks, accessible penny stocks. You don't need a lot of money. Then you're at this phase now where you're really starting to get into the nuts and bolts of doing this thing. And you still favor the short term timeframes. Why was that? Yeah. That's a very good question. Because one of the things I realized early on is that I need to focus on trying to learn one thing really well in any given time. So while I did kind of like dabble into swing trading or even options trading here and there, I realized that I wasn't good at those things really, really quick.

So that's one of the also another pretty important moments for me because most people and I did this too when we first started, we're just going to jump left and right and trying out different strategies that people are talking about on Reddit in the chat rooms on X or Twitter. And then you kind of abandon your original, your craft or the project or the strategy that you are studying in the first place. So I figured out that, you know, in one of that kind of jump ship and chase a next shiny object, I kind of lose focus and kind of have to go back to the beginning all over the again. So that's why I decided, hey, I just want to focus on day trading. And, you know, don't worry about swing trading, don't worry about options trading for now. I just want to get really good at this one thing and one thing only. I love that. I think that that's a really interesting way in looking at it.

And that's a, I think a really important point for people actually. I'm so stoked that you hit that because you that I think we've all done that where you kind of bounce between things and you don't have much to show for it, which is always frustrating. Yeah. When you started getting into trading, what led you into trading specifically? So you were looking for fast money, but there's other ways to get fast money. You could be a drug dealer. You could snuggle people, right? There's lots of careers. What led to trading specifically was there's something interesting of the markets where you're doing work in some capacity around markets or did you just hear of it? And that was the route you took. I started looking at alternative ways to make some more supplemental income because at the time I had a full-time job in film in LA. Brent was expensive and my job and my employment income was not stable. So I think I just kind of started searching up online. How do you make money online? Or like site hustle ideas? And trading is the one that kind of appealed more to me because I like the idea that I can sit in front of the computer before I go to work and then try",

So I like the fact that I can do the trading the morning and then go to my job. So that's what really appealed to me. And I think I tried a couple of other things too, but this trading ended up, you know, ended up as the one I focused on. I tried to control the things at the same time too, but ended up taking a focus. Got it. And was the focus on trading because you were finding success or was it because it was interesting to you or another reason? No, I definitely wasn't finding success in the beginning. So I'm glad you asked. But I just really liked it. Like I was really drawn to the idea that also like I was super young at the time, you know, I was in my early 20s, but I was super drawn to the fact that every single day is different in trading.

That's a good question because I think my process of pre-market planning of, you know, looking for scanning for stocks to trade, reading the news and then creating my watch list has been pretty much very, very similar since that beginning stage.

Before the most part of my process, the big picture process has been the same for the last, I've been trading for 10 years, for the last seven years, it's been the same where I'm scanning for stocks and looking at the charts and looking at news and then I plan the individual plays or the potential trades that I'm going to trade.

And then once I have that information, then I'll take a look at the intraday charts. I'm using a lot of the five minute charts nowadays. So that's one small detail that changed from 10 years ago. I used to use a lot more one minute charts. Nowadays, I use a five minute charts. And the shortest time frame I'll use is two minute charts. Got it. And do you wait those charts differently for different products or is the waiting about the same in terms of the time frames?

What do you think is the first kind of options trading style or approach I took? I would have to get out of the money calls. And I would guess shorter term expiration. I don't know what catalyst you would choose because one of the interesting thing about options is a lot of the small cap stocks you might have been trading at the time. They might not even have options. So that part I don't have a good read on, but that would be my my first level guess is that you're using further out of the money options because they're a cheaper and they",

So that part I don't have a good read on, but that would be my my first level guess is that you're using further out of the money options because they're a cheaper and they can compound more and not going too far out in time because they're cheaper by not going too far out in time. That's the guess. Yeah, you're close. I was waiting at zero DTEs. I was trying to scalp those. So about as short as you can go. Got it. Yeah. Yeah. To shorten my time frame even more. Oh my god. Yeah, it was so wild. So especially on Fridays, I used to, so I at this point, I was still in a chat room. But the way I used to chat room was very different. I'm just trying to see what other people's ideas are and I'll see if there's anything I can trade out of their ideas like my own strategies. But in the same chat room, there's like an options chat room. So the stuff they're doing seems extremely intriguing. You take these options, contracts at only 50 cents and then if it hits, it can hit 500 in one day. So that's kind of what attracted me. And at this point, I was still already finding some success in trading stocks. So I just decided that, you know, oh, let me try this options thing",

And then I started trading these zero DTEs right away. And then a lot of the instruments I was trading were, you know, just like spy. Especially the, like you said, the yellow calls, expiring the same week or sometimes the same day. I remember trading a lot of Tesla when Tesla was really, really hot in 2016, 2017. That was really fun. But I don't think I ever made money from from zero DTEs. Like I'll make money here and there. But then when I lose money, I'll lose 100 of it. Right. So that kind of just cancels out everything. But it was fun. I'll say that. But also one of my blowups after, I want my blowups into my year four was because of options trading because of the zero DTEs.

Maybe you have one or two, a couple hundred percent or a thousand percent.

And then you, exactly as you say, you tie it. Your financial freedom is now predicated on this other person. Again, it's essentially just having a boss again. I know. Yeah. Yeah. I find that connection to be pretty funny. But it's still ironic too. Yeah. It is. Well, the pursuit of easy money is always a luring to everybody. It's why so many people will go play the lottery, right? Even though from a probability standpoint, it's not necessarily a great way. People will still do it. So, yeah, I could always see there being a group like that. When you look at your community that you've built, how have they evolved alongside your evolution of trading? Have they broadly moved with you? Do they do a lot of different things? But there's crossover. How does that work for your people? Yeah.

Like we have video lessons, they'll join. They'll try to do everything like by the book and copy exactly what I'm looking for, which is great. I rather them do that than to try to like figure out zero DTEs or try to trade stocks. But I think in the beginning, most people are going to be very by the book. Oh, that's say I'm looking for, I'm saying, oh, in the strategy, look for 20 gap, they'll do exactly that. And I think that's fine. But I think gradually, you know, most traders and most members after at least three or six months of very intensive learning and trading, they start to develop their own way of thinking.

They have the proper foundation, they know the tools and they have the knowledge, you kind of tweak the strategies, tweak the criteria, tweak the scanners to fit what works the best for them according to their risk tolerance. So in the beginning, everyone's not going to be by the book trying to copy exactly what you say in the video lessons. But at the end, you know, after a year, after two years, they usually develop their own style and they know exactly what they're looking for. And now a lot of the people who's been here for a while, I'm asking for their ideas. I'm asking to see what they're looking at because I know by now how they trade, they have almost like a different strategy after all this time. So it's kind of the reverse now. I would try to like pick the brain and try to see what they're looking at and see if there's anything I can use in my own strategies and try to apply",

I would try to like pick the brain and try to see what they're looking at and see if there's anything I can use in my own strategies and try to apply my own thing to make money. So that's the thing I love about trading. You can be very flexible. You can make things your own. Yeah. Well, it's also cool that you guys create an environment for that because like we were talking about in the beginning, I actually think that's probably one of the most defining features of somebody that can be successful at this long term is doing exactly that. It's taking the time to like build something that makes sense for them. When you look over your trading career, what are some of the things that you used to do that as you think about it, you're like, why would I ever do that? But you did. What kind of things like that exists for you? Yeah. I think in the very beginning, I was very opposed to trading the mega caps, like the apples, the Amazon, the Google, the Nvidia.

If I traded, I'll probably have to... 140 at the time, I was trading a small account. I couldn't afford that many shares to make money. I can probably take what, 50 shares, and then try to make a dollar to dollars from that. This is day trading. At the time, it didn't make sense that why would anyone want to trade that? But I think now, I'm more open to the idea and actually prefer trading the big caps over the small caps because they are a lot more, in my opinion, at least in today, they're a lot more predictable. They kind of follow trends a certain way. And there are certain charts patterns and price action that you just see repeatedly again and again in all these mega-cap stocks. So now I'm more... A lot more open to the idea of, let's just say, trading and video, the actual stock. And something like Apple, Amazon, or even Tesla, I'll trade them. I'll take the extra shares. Got it.

And that's how you're building your understanding of the relationship with some of these patterns. Yeah. So I used to study a lot of charts. I still do, but obviously not as intensive as I did the first four years. So I used to save charts and now I'll analyze... I'll say the different time frames. We talked about like one minute chart, deity chart, five minute charts. So I used to say those charts, well all the stocks I've traded. And it's not like I memorized a pattern, but over time you kind of start seeing some similar trends and some similar patterns. That's how the morning setup looks a certain way on the five minute chart and there's negative news in the market. There's certain things that you can't predict them or guarantee it 100 all the time, but there's certain things that you start to see that, hey, maybe I can...

So to answer your questions, a lot of that is just based on past experience and seeing the same charts and the same price action over and over again. So a lot of observation time, yeah. That's one of the things that always fascinated me with like pattern style trading because I tend to apply a bit of a quantitative approach with a practical approach.

You know, I'm saying like, when a stock gaps up, we're talking about just smoke cap stocks. What's the probability of this happening? And I'll even track it by months. So, you know, during summer months, the probabilities like 30 was lower during the winter and the fall and the spring, the probabilities a lot higher. So I use to track everything. So that's how I start to build at these some sense of, okay, pattern recognition in which I call this actual valuable data collection, actual valuable information. As opposed to just trying to set up for two weeks, thinking you actually tried the strategy, but in fact, you didn't record any of it. I hope this makes sense. I feel like it makes a ton of sense. It makes a ton of sense because I find people do that with a ton of things across trading, where they have hazardly tried something. There's no record to actually refer what the outcomes were. Yeah.

And that's kind of what I was highlighting by talking that through with you because if you tried something for two weeks and then you just bail on it, that thing might have worked, but you don't have a good record to be able to say objectively, yes or no, and you might not have let it try long enough. Now, going back to the broader question, though, when you first started trading like these different setups and patterns, how did you call through the thousands that are there and say, I'm going to try these 15, these 10, these five, whatever and see how these work. And then how did you narrow that down? Because when I think about the prospects of day trading via some sort of like candlestick patterns or just price behavior on an intraday time frame, I think that's probably one of the most common things I see people talk about is like, how do you pick? Are you going to use a doji? Are you going to use the hammers? Like they use all the individual candles, then setups of candles like the three of three down, like all those kinds of things.

Like they use all the individual candles, then setups of candles like the three of three down, like all those kinds of things. How did you sift through the broad universe of intraday patterns into the things you thought were worth testing? And then from there, how did you narrow that down further? So I think there's two aspects to this question. The first one is, I don't actually know, I know kennel said patterns and chart patterns are, I know people use an interchangeably, but I don't actually use the candlestick patterns like, oh, sugar star, like I don't actually use that. But I look at the bigger picture, like what the entire day chart look like, whether it has higher lows, I look at that and what the trend looks like. So I'm more, I'm also looking at candlestick trends than the individual candlestick patterns. But when that's my style of looking at charts, but when I look at the entire chart, I feel like I can see a bigger picture. Now where does that initial inspiration come from? Well, it comes from like the initial when I was in the chat rooms and I took a lot of courses.

So I know that the shorts are in pain. But at the same time, you know, we also know that eventually, you know, I say eventually, there will be a huge red day to pullback because in terms of price action, this is like, you know, a lot of irrational buying and also a lot of the a lot of the buying is from short sellers covering on the way up. We're talking about all the parabolic green candles. So there's a couple ways to play this when, you know, as crazy and as dangerous as the sounds, a lot of times with these kind of parabolic daily charts, we do what I do, I say the trend joined long. I'll try to join a trend and intraday out, I'll keep buying on the way up because I know shorts are getting squeezed. I'll try to do that on like the third or the fourth day, green candle.

There's a huge gap in between. So this is how you know, like a stock is like taking off. Like it's already going parabolic when there's a huge gap in between the candles. And there's going to be a huge red day coming soon. It could be the next three days, four days, five days. But then if, you know, I will take the longs during those intraday and try to like take advantage of those huge moves. That's when, you know, the the the the the ATR, the sorry, the average to range of a stock can increases a lot intraday, the range of the stock. So I'll go long during those. I call the trend joined long when I see this kind of daily candles. And then a lot of traders, small caps or large caps, they'll time that huge red candle.

So usually when we try to short those when once the stock is actually red on the day, then I'll short those knowing that the downside is a lot greater because the stock has been so extended, right? It's like polling a rubber band. When you stretch it so far for so many days and you just so intense and there's just so much buying tight in the stock, when finally you release the rubber band finally, it's going to snap all the way over and I go over extended to a downside. So then what time and try to trade a short day when there is a short day confirmed, then you just join it to the downside this time.

I didn't expect this, but you and I look at some of the same things and we do, but we trade them slightly differently. So for for stuff like this, I have kind of different scans that count consecutive updates. Essentially, soon as there's three or above, it adds it to a list and then I rank it by gaps between them. Okay. And I look for a very similar and it's funny. I call it the same thing a parabolic up move.

And you know, it's a smaller overall day as compared to stuff like this that have just much bigger moves. Do you wait them in some way? Do you have some sort of predictive tool that you try to analyze what you think that up move might look like for the day? Yeah, I keep it extremely simple. The day I'm trading and I say today's Friday, then today's open and today's lower day needs to be higher than yesterday's higher day. So the stock needs to have already opened and traded above the high day from the day before. So the candles you're pointing at those tiny ones, I wouldn't be trading those because they're under your studies highs. Got it. Yep. So the high was here.

So I'm trying to kind of adapt a little bit more now. Before the long side and short side for both of those, I will only swing it and keep it for a couple of days.

Because a lot of these moves and it's from I run it through Python. So I have like a really large data set depending on the kind of product and the behavior when it starts moving into these parabolic up moves.

I love learning and sharing different approaches to markets that's kind of some of the coolest parts about this. Yeah. And like it's really cool that we both see the same chart. We're just describing and maybe we sometimes we use both say parabolic, but maybe in the beginning, you didn't really understand what I was talking about until we see the same chart that we know all what's talking about the exact same chart. I have to like I did not expect that. I really didn't. I thought that you would be looking for completely different things than I typically do. And then as soon as you pointed that out, I was like, this is actually kind of nuts because there's like heavy crossover there. Even the way that you play the down move is fascinating to me. I play that a little differently. Not in terms of following the trend down. I'll do that, but I don't use strategies that capitalize on the down moves as much.

So you've actually given me some homework. Believe it or not. Take a look at the probability of the big red day and the size of the move on those. So thank you for thank you for the homework. Oh, a couple of last questions for you. So I think one of the coolest things that traders that have been in the game for a while can do is to just share not necessarily some of their biggest mistakes. There's a million of those all over the place. But the thing I like to try to explore with people are some of the things that you learned and think other people should know that are not talked about that much. Do you have anything like that that comes to mind for you and your path? Yeah. So that's also another reason I'm trying to swing trade more this year and even open the new account because I do feel like day traders for the most part would leave a lot of money on the table. So I agree with what you said before. Like, you know, like you can maximize it more. So that's the one part I'm really trying to work on this year and next year. I do think that there are a lot of times where, you know, yeah, day",

You know, we just obviously with a swing trading, I would be more selective and only swing trade when I see, you know, certain very, very good setups. I think just day trading wouldn't do it justice.

Like you've been trading for over a decade now and you were talking about that and the way you do things. And I have to say that's just another pure commonality I find between those of us that tend to trade for a long time is we constantly are looking for other ways we can do things like you gave me an idea in this one, right? Like that's the whole point is that we're always looking for different things. So I'm actually really stoked about the swing training component and I am eager to hear your results because I have some ideas on what we'll see and I think it'll be good to be honest. So I'm excited for that. The last question I have for you is I know that the Lamborghini is a big part of your brand, right? Like we have the Lamborghini microphone. I don't even know what those things are called the low microphone cover thing. You know, I guess maybe so people hit themselves on the face or something crazy. But anyways, I love the joke around the Lamborghini, but I am a car guy and I love McLaren's. So I'm wondering if I can find a way to send you a McLaren thing and maybe once in a while I",

It's like they're all so over that I have them. I have them. I love them. But like it's all just so over the top. It's all bullshit. So I wouldn't call one inherently better than the other. It's kind of like none of us that are buying them. I run a car club. So like I love driving and stuff like that, but not a professional driver. So you could have somebody that's probably a professional driver beat me in a Honda Civic. So you know, it's I think it's more about what style you like. But anyways, I am curious.

And it's very cool to find one that I would consider to be very genuine. So thanks for doing everything that you do. And thanks for coming to hang out for a while. Thanks Eric.
