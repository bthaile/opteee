Let me see if I can fix this. And... I'll put streaming. Just trying to turn up what kind of resource this is getting. I have no idea why this is showing such a weak connection. Normally it's a okay. Strange. Let me know if this is even coming through for you guys, or if it's like super choppy or something. All right, there we go. This looks like we should be good. I'm seeing zero drop frames. I'm seeing solid connection. Let me know if we are looking okay from your end. From what I can see, it looks all right. I will kick us off. Strange. Always something. I gotta say. But the age old approach of not knowing how to fix it and just turn it off and turn it on still remains undefeated. All right, so let's get over to the main screen and let's run through the agenda. The game plan for today is I want to do a quick market overview. Just walk through what I was seeing. In the overall market today, I want to run through some general news. Then I want to dive into a couple portfolio updates, not too many. Because there's not a whole lot going on. And then I want to pivot to",

Then I want to dive into a couple portfolio updates, not too many. Because there's not a whole lot going on. And then I want to pivot to running through some scans, seeing if we can find anything. And then I'm going to talk to you all a little bit about kind of the upcoming content schedule. I'm going to each month I typically try some different things. So that's the game plan at least is to walk you through some of the adjustments I'm making. One of them is going to be the primary weekly videos going to come out on Sundays. Now I'm actually going to probably tick up the number of pro live streams throughout the week. So right now we're typically doing two. And I'm going to try to round that out probably to at least three. I want to spend a little more time talking about like the ins and outs of trading and try to spend a little time diving deeper into that. So more to come on all of that. Before we get too far as always, you know, we've got to say hello to everybody. Make sure you say hello to your friends that you see in the chat. Hopefully you have some friends. Most of us do. I feel like most people that come hang out on the streams",

What up April been looking for a while excited to join a live great to have you here. We also got Zachariah Lawrence out here making everybody pissed off doing dumb things. We'll talk about that. Whatever that was. We also have travel, Ursula Jimmy, Shrey and James and H got everybody. Literally have everybody could ever on a live stream. So let's talk about the market at a high level first flexible grid. You know what's up. What do we see today? Big, big move realistically. So we saw a pretty massive jump in the SP 500. We saw it in cues. We did not see it yet again in the Russell. The Russell continues to lag. Very important point. Vicks contracted a bit bonds are three month lows at this point. Bitcoin is still trending up hovering just over 100 K. We have materials making lows, calm services, pivoting leading a little bit of this short term turnover.

This is still primary weakness whenever we're trying to find things to run to the downside. This continues to be the honey pot tons to do. They're same thing with real estate real estate at this point is trending sideways a little bit better for risk premium plays. Utilities rolling over after their slight recovery still showing a ton of weakness and then health care is still chopping a little bit. I mean, it's like showing some slight slight recovery from 137 up to 139, but trivial at that best. And then discretionary is still massively outperforming staples, which I still continue to find interesting. And then defense sector is trending downside chopping a little bit. If I were to summarize where I'm seeing strength right now, it's the same places we've seen it for some time. Tech AI has been really, really big. You can find a lot of things, even things like Palantir interestingly enough, I've been I'm trying to get a reentry here, but I just can't justify it. So my hope is Palantir will start behaving a little bit better so that I can justify a reentry, but it",

So that's a little frustrating to see. Same thing with Sofie. These two I've been keeping a pretty close eyeball on. Sofie had a really great day today up 3 but still I mean like in a broader context that's not doing well. So neither of these deserve any money from me at this point. It'll be a little especially for Sofie. They're becoming it's becoming a little too choppy right. So we can see that it's getting this decent size rally. If we look at I want the daily range, if we look at a five day daily range average daily range, it's 5.12 20 days 5.78, but a 90 days 4.9. So leading into this, we were actually seeing Sofie behaving pretty well with more inside days consistent movements, but this is not good. So this is price discovery happening kind of real time. People trying to figure out what they value the stock at. And so yeah, these have been unfortunately nothing too interesting.

So Reese mentioned that meta has taken Dana White onto the board, which is really, really smart move, just a really, really smart move by meta because I think Dana White is a fantastic leader. He does a great job running a business like the UFC and he even kept it going during something like COVID. He's really effectual. Now I don't think he would do as well in something like meta just because of how big it is like the UFC does a lot of money, but it's not a big company. Now meta is just massive. So from that element, very, very different, but it's also a really smart decision because Trump is friends with Dana and that just helps. So my guess is it's a pretty wise political decision being made by Musk, not Musk, sorry, by Zuckerberg, which interestingly Zuckerberg also has gotten into Jits himself. So I think that yeah, I think because Zuckerberg's been to a bunch of the fights at the UFC, he's even walked out with Volker before. So yeah, he does like the UFC. I'm sure he has an existing relationship with Dana,",

It's creeping up on all time highs, massive, massive, massive volume today on a relative basis. And it is just up and out, which looks really, really good. So I have my ratio called diagonal that's been down. So unfortunately, I did not participate in this move through a direct play, but I do have my leverage stuff via T-Triple Q's and Upro, which obviously is a lot of Nvidia inherently. So I still participated in directly through those. But yeah, really, really interesting movement today. And speaking of the leveraged coverage strangles, we have Q's is still rotating a little bit. This gap looks good, but this is an embryonic turnaround in my opinion because we really need to challenge this lower high and this needs to exceed it. And I mean, if right now it doesn't feel like that to me, it feels like it might come up close to it, hover around before rolling back over. The reason why I say that is just because this move wasn't really sponsored overly heavily.",

The reason why I say that is just because this move wasn't really sponsored overly heavily. It definitely wasn't expansion and volume for sure, but it's kind of split. And you can see that 57 of the volume today was on the sales side. And you can see that this is a tiny little body of a candle. That's not great. That means that buyers are coming in, but they're being controlled by sellers and vice versa. But that means that it's about equal distribution of interest at this point. So that is something to be aware of. I did add a little bit more risk into Upro and into T-Triple Q's for the coverage triangle. I'll go more into that stuff a little bit later, but that's where the market's kind of sitting as of today as far as I see it. And yesterday we ran through all of this stuff for the week coming ahead and all that stuff. So I'm not going to go through that again. Now I do want to talk a little bit about my performance for last year. And the reason why I want to talk about this is just so everybody knows, right?

And I had been giving periodic updates as we were going through the year. And what I noticed was a few things. Last year was really, really strong for trading directionally. The other thing that helped me out a ton last year was rotating into the leveraged coverage triangles. So I had started the leveraged coverage triangles. I've traded them for a long time, but I flow into an out of them for different reasons, different market conditions. So last year moving into them was really efficacious. That's where a lot of this return came from the core allocation was from the leveraged coverage triangles. And why it's not as strong as what they should have been is because I didn't stay in them all year. I didn't start in them right away. I was still trading other things before I pivoted over to them. Then the remainder of the movement really came down from the speculative allocation. That's what this top section is. So 58 of the total return on the portfolio came from speculative allocation. And within that speculative allocation component, the majority of it came from ratio-called diagonals trading things directionally. I had talked a little bit about that trade in APP.

If we want to review it, I would be down to review it during maybe one of the pro livestreams or something. The reason why I'm not super jazzed about talking about it is because I didn't really do anything. So there's not much to talk about. It's like it's throwing darts at a dartboard and that one happened to stick well, right? So I don't necessarily feel warm and fuzzy about doing anything special with the trade. The management of the trade was whatever. It yeah, there just wasn't a whole lot. But that trade did account for a non-trivial amount of this 29 in that one trade because that one trade was significant. And for those that didn't see how APP moved, you can see, I think I got into it on like the 11th of September and I traded pretty much the bulk of that run up. So that's where that was.

So I do trade long wall coming into earnings, but it's a really small section of this. It's like maybe 2 of the total return ish. I think it's sub 2, but like high 1. So this I thought was interesting though and something that's topical because normally trading earnings is a much bigger part of my annual book. And trading earnings generally offers a fantastic return profile because it's completely decoupled generally from market beta. It's not tied to what the rest of the market is doing, which is what makes it so attractive to me. I have non correlated returns, but I kept coming across instances where things did not look lucrative. So my overall trading activity in earnings play specifically was very, very light compared to what it typically is. I track what I would trade. I have my live trades that go on, but then I also track what I would trade, meaning just put on paper traits for all of them.

That's interesting. And it makes me a little concerned because I've seen years like that before, but not that frequently. So what makes me nervous about that is it, I really hope that that is not a new market norm. That would be bad because this is still hopefully going to be a significant driver of performance for this coming year, but VAL is just not priced well. So it leads me to be a little uncomfortable with scaling into the strategies and really leaning on it as a strategy, just because the edge is really declining a bit. Now zeroes, I notice a little bit of the same. And going forward, you're actually going to notice that this bucket, the zero DTE is going to grow. What I mean by that is this is going to be like zero to 14 DTE. I'm going to bucket all of them the same.

If I listed like every permutation of what I did here, it'd be really difficult to even track visually. So that's why I'm just kind of bundling all of those short term index style strategies. That's what zero DTE means to me here. That's only going to be done in the indices themselves, specifically things like SPX. And I wonder how well it's going to perform this year because last year without starting to pivot to other time frames, zeroes did not impress me either. Again, you can see what worked hands down the best on a relative basis. And it was taking market beta, obviously, it's the market flow off the handle to the upside. And the trend following, which just find that a little bit interesting to me. So this year, I'm essentially starting with a clean slate like everybody does. And I still have a bunch of levered cover triangles on. I will continue to run those. And then based on the recent live stream that I did for GameStop this last Saturday, I've actually increased the allocation for the coverage strangle for GameStop to 25K.

    "text": "then based on the recent live stream that I did for GameStop this last Saturday, I've actually increased the allocation for the coverage strangle for GameStop to 25K. I was originally planning on just doing a 15K coverage strangle, but it was about 50 of the total group had 25K plus positions in there. So it becomes a little bit more relevant to do it with the slightly larger allocation. Now to be clear, 25K versus 15K, this is the same shit. It really is. The only difference is the total number of shares and lots I will be transacting at. So for those that have a smaller portfolio or even smaller than 25K, don't feel any type of way about it because we will still absolutely be able to track this together. You'll be able to see what I'm doing and how I'm doing. But I do need to now add more risk into GameStop. That's for damn sure. So first things first, let me take a look. I want to make sure that my log is updated and then I'll port it over into this for us to take a look at. Yeah. So I grabbed a couple of hundred shares of you pro today at 9435. I bit is the same. And then GameStop is good. I need to add more risk into GameStop now. And let's pull this over into my workbook and then we can take a stroll together. We're going. Okay. So this I",

So this I think we can probably fly through pretty quick unless anybody has any questions as always happy to go into them. There's just really nothing that exciting going on. So for T triple Q's, there's literally been no change. The main thing for T triple Q's is I do have this in the money short call. This in the money short call expires on 17 Jan of this year. And that's a little problematic because you can see this is already a rolled short call. So the original role, I can tell you happened right here, right? As I can see that there's a massive debit to close this trade out that tells me right away that this is a role position. So this has already been rolled once and is likely going to need to be rolled again. Now let's take a look at what that actually looks like the option itself. So we'll go in here. We'll go to T triple Q's. And we are in the 17 Jan 25's 11 days out and we have the 82's. So these are about ready to be rolled to be honest. They're pretty deep in the money. There is 67 Delta.",

And if this is like, if I'm talking about this stuff and you're like, yeah, what the fuck is this dude talking about?

So what we can do is we can do some math here and we can figure out what our required sizing is in order to get out at a break even. So you can see all I'm doing is multiplying across and then I'm going to sum these just like this. So I essentially need to get at least 2.05. If I can get 2.05, that is my break even point for exiting this, right? So the way that this would work is like this. Just so that you can see the example all the way through. So let's say that I can sell something for 2.05 and then let's say I can close it out. It comes to expiration for nothing. Now if we sum all this up, you can see we're at break even.

Now for selling short calls like this, the goal isn't to be break even. It's to make money. But it's also really, really important to remember where we started. We started with a basis of 80, then we changed it to 82, right? So we started here and then we were able to move it to 82. So what I like to do is track what the total percent changes between these so that I have a little bit of context as I'm moving forward. And I have a specific tracker that does all this stuff just more neatly. I'm showing you literally the back of the napkin math here so that you can create your own versions of this. That's why I spend the time walking you through this thing. So I was able to collect a credit and I was able to increase my basis by 2.5. It's considerably large because again, let's do some other scratch math to make this even more confusing. If we have 100 shares and our original sell price was going to be 80 because this was the original strike price. It doesn't matter what our basis is. Our basis is 7332.",

We would make money no matter what, right? That's great. But we can also figure out what the difference is in terms of how much money, how much more money I stand to make. Now obviously the math here is really easy. We just take the new price that I would be able to sell at, multiply, you take the new price I'd be able to sell at less the prior price. So 82 minus 80 times 100. So I make 200 more on the total profit potential in the trade. So even though in this role, I rolled for flat money. It didn't make anything. It was 985 out. It was 985 in by still making this role and increasing my basis by 2.5. I increased my total profit potential by 200. I will take a pause there.

You've either heard this before or you're asking to fuck is this either of those. And I'm, my guess is most people that have at least heard about rolling will be familiar with this concept. And I'm going to explain to you why it's completely wrong. So for those that are saying, the fuck is this great question. Let's talk about it. For those that are voting or for those that have voted to fuck is this. My first question for you is, are you familiar with what the idea of rolling is?

    "text": "great question. Let's talk about it. For those that are voting or for those that have voted to fuck is this. My first question for you is, are you familiar with what the idea of rolling is? And again, if you are cool, if you're not, tell me. And I literally will explain, okay, perfect. So Lauren says, this is why we love Lauren, not only because she has long legs and she's in a long distance relationship with Day Swag, but because she is willing to help everybody learn. So we're on the standard set up now. So that means you guys get the Eric special, which is, well, you guys know what the Eric special is. It's a shitty drawing. It's obviously with the Eric special is going to see how much you guys can see of this. Let me squish this so that I know exactly. Go right. Lovely. That means I've just pushed this down to you. That's annoying. The screen is like just missized. Just the worst. All right, let me grab this. The first thing's first, we need to change our color. And we have a person. So there's our person. You can see that they have a head and they have arms and those are obviously these are the legs. So if you have any idea who this person is, you can shout them out in the chat. This is one of our, one of our favorite people. Trace says, bling, we don't",

We need some money for bling and we're working on getting the bling, but we're not quite there yet. We have a couple, a couple of things that we need to do in order to access the bling. Lauren says, I also like your newest video. It was zoomed in into tiny numbers. Yeah, that's awesome. So I'm working a lot with with the new editor to try to make the videos more consumable. Again, the disposition for editors is to try to drive up engagement, which is great. But as you know, I much, much prefer just good content and good information. So I don't like a ton of like screen switches and big noises because a big thing that they do is they insert a ton of stock images of like a dude like grabbing his face or some shit. Like I don't care about any of that. So yeah, I'm glad that so far that stuff's been good. I'm hoping to continue dialing in. So this is correct. This would be Lauren.

Rolling is fake. Rolling means nothing. That aside. It is a common term used for a specific accounting method. Rolling is simply when we close this option. So bought to close and let's say that we closed it for two dollars. It doesn't even have to be two dollars actually. Let me do a different scenario. Fifty cents. We've made money.

The standard inference for rolling is if I close this trade here, this trade we would have made fifty bucks. If I close this and open this one, the overwhelming majority of people would not refer to this as a role.

What do you notice? What's the difference here? The difference is the common inference for when somebody says I rolled is that it was a losing trade. It doesn't have to be a losing trade. Again, going back to the beginning, Stelio is right on it, same thing with David. Perfect, nice job. The context of a role in a nutshell is simply when we're tying the accounting between two different trades together. The reality of things is that they are two different trades. That's it. The rolling is a massive mental gymnastic. Now that being said, I roll all the time. I'm talking about this rolled short call right now. The reason why we use rolling is it helps us consolidate the PNL for an individual trade or position. But again, we normally would not refer, let's say that I closed this one. I closed this trade in this example and I made 126 and then I sold this one. I wouldn't refer to this as a role. Functionally that's what it is.",

You have a couple examples right here to work off of. A couple notes while Lauren is doing that is, okay, so Lauren says, I understand what the role is, I don't understand the why.

The true reason why is to tie the accounting together so that you can track the overall movement of a position. Here's essentially what this means. I will close this. In this example, I had the 20 dees 80 calls. I sold them for 320 and I bought them back for 985. That realizes 665 loss. The purpose of rolling is to put on new positions that can overcome this loss that are essentially tied to this original trade. That's the purpose of rolling. So it allows us to tie the accounting together for something. So then at the end of this, I can see whether or not the adjustments made to this individual position either move me into profit or not. Now to the broader point, you don't need to track it this way. You literally can track them just like I do right here and track them as each individual short call and just see how it comes out in the wash. That is entirely, entirely reasonable viable. But the purpose of rolling is to hone in on individual positions a little bit more closely. So that's the idea behind rolling. Now one of the things that people are told is what I put in the poll, which is when you roll, you're told that you have to roll for a",

Now one of the things that people are told is what I put in the poll, which is when you roll, you're told that you have to roll for a credit. You have to roll for a credit. And what you're told is that if you don't roll for a credit, you are potentially or you are locking in a loss. Does that sound familiar to anybody specifically that has answered the 62 that has answered heard this to the poll? This is what I just say sound familiar where you were told that if you don't roll for a credit, you're locking in a loss. Okay. So Reese is familiar with it. Anybody else? I just want to see how common that element is. Yep. Okay. Cool. So what if I told you that you can roll for a debit and not. Lock in a loss and still have a net profitable role at the end of it. Does that sound wrong? Does that sound off from what you've heard? Does what I just say does it sound like what's the reaction to it? Does that sound normal? Okay.

And I said, you don't have to roll for a credit in order to have a profitable role at the end of it. Would you say that person is right or wrong? Any any input there? Shana also says because the underlying makes more profit than the credit would be that's not it. That's actually not it at all. The best answer is to why it is is from Tommy. Tommy has the correct response. So Kai says roll down into the money or out in time. Those are different ways you can roll. What I'm emphasizing though is that the statement that you've heard before, the statement of you have to roll for a credit. Otherwise you're locking in a loss is patently false. It's wrong. It's dead wrong. It is not correct. You can roll for a debit and still have a profitable role. That's the point I'm trying to make here. You do not have to roll for a credit. You do",

That's the point I'm trying to make here. You do not have to roll for a credit. You do have to track the basis of your roles. So let me show you. If we take a look and we see 3.20 to 9.85, 9.85 to negative 5.25. So this if we needed to roll for a credit, that means this number would have to be at least 5.26. That's the only spot that I would get a credit is if this was 5.26, that gives me a one penny credit over this. But what I just showed you is I only need 205. So that means if I sell this for 250, if I sell this for 250, that is a debit from this. That means I'm buying to close this for 5.25. I'm giving out 525 and now I'm only taking back in 250. That's less. That's not a credit that's rolling for a debit. But I still make money. I would have made 45 in this trade. So you do not need to roll for a credit. So what that means is in this example, when I go to close this trade to roll my short call that's in the money, I do not need to get 525 or better. I need to get 205 or better.",

That's all we need in order to get out of this for profit. So let's take a look instead at where we can get 205. So for 205, we can go all the way out here to the 96. So let's take a look at that. Actually, no, I want to do it for a small debit, my bad. For the example, here, this is a small debit, 97. We get it for 204. So here we go to the 97. This would represent an 18 improvement in our basis. I should have wrote this formula correctly so that I don't have to keep doing this. Here we go. And then what did I say we get 204? So if we close this out for no money, we make 204, let this down one. So from the option side of things, we make this plus this. Oh, no, I'm sorry. I said we needed at least 205. So that's already rolling for a debit. That was my bad. So we need this one, my bad. We need the 96 for 209. That gives us a small",

We need the 96 for 209. That gives us a small total credit. So we need the 96 for 209. Because again, just a quick reminder, because I kind of messed that up. This represents rolling for a credit. This represents rolling for a debit, but paying attention to this, which is what we actually need in order to break even. So in this scenario, you would have made 4 on your premiums. But guess what you make on the trade in total. This is the outlier way of rolling option. Notice the difference. Which one would you prefer to walk away with? Would you rather roll for a debit and make way more money on your trade? Or would you rather follow blindly? The statement you've heard of, I have to roll for a credit and make less money. And that's what I'm saying. I'm not going to make it. I'm not going to make it. I'm not going to make it. I'm not going to make it. I'm not going to make it. You're nobody. You're going to make it.

It might be you might be talking about all about how you track some role with a different underlying because ultimately it is to earn money and use the capital for the best trade at the time. Oh, I see. I see. Yeah. I don't know anybody that would roll into a different underlying because that breaks the purpose of a role, right? The again, like, actually, let's just look it up really quick. I bet you would be on Investopedia option, rolling, invest the pdf. So Investopedia tells us, oh, here we go. This is better because it's not just about rolling down, about rolling in option. Let's get rid of this one. This definitely my bad. A role down is accomplished by closing the initial contract and opening a new contract for the same underlying asset at a lower strike price. Then I think that's like the general understanding of a role is that it's not tied to different tickers. Like I don't roll from trading gold into SP, like they're completely different",

The entire premise behind a role is that you're trading a specific ticker. Travel says, yeah, but the point is if you get stuck in thinking you must roll for a credit, may not be the best thing to do. It's time to look at the bigger picture. Of course. Yeah. Yeah. That's, but that's a completely different thing. I would just clarify those two different concepts. Rolling is in the same ticker. It's not rolling in different tickers. If you move to a different ticker, it's no longer a role. You're just closing for a loss, which you do want to roll anyways, but then you're trading something different. The point I'm making more broadly back here is that you don't actually have to roll for a credit in order to make money on the trade. That's the main point. You literally make 65 more money rolling for a debit and prioritizing the basis improvement here from 82 to 96, which is a 17 basis improvement versus 82 to 87, which is a 6 basis improvement. Yes.

But I would have made 1400 on the underlying. This person doesn't make anything close to that on the underlying. They make 500. So almost a third. So that's the broader point here. Is that the statement that you've heard at some point of rolling for a credit is complete bullshit. You do not have to roll for a credit. Shannan also says so so people who talk about that roll for a credit in the quote only talk about each trade, but ignore the whole chain that led there. That's exactly correct. And it's a giant mistake in accounting. And this is one of the bigger problems I have with trying to come up with blanket rules for things as a trader. The blanket rule of roll for a credit is designed to protect you from you. Because if you do not track this number right here, you absolutely can roll and lock in a loss, a losing position. So the reason why you're told to roll for a credit is literally to give you a generalized base rule that over it's",

But you lose so much specificity. You lose a ton of money potential in the trade. So this is showing you you don't have to roll for credit. You have to pay attention to the money in and the money out throughout the entire trade. And always remember in this instance, when we're talking about short calls, is that it's tied to an equity position. And that's always going to be the basis primary driver profit mechanism of a covered call or a ratio covered call. This is why I insist that outlier traders understand the concept of profit mechanisms. Because if you don't, you might get too wrapped up in trying to manage this short call that's in the money. And you might be sitting there saying, well, I got to make money on these options. I got to make sure I make some money on these options. And it's completely misplaced.

So we know based on that previous ensemble that I need to make at least two or five, because I need this plus this plus this, whatever it is for the net here, hold on. No 320. So I need 320. That's what this represents. So now I need to see where I can get that. Let's take a look. We are right now at the 82.

I'm probably going to want to come into 25 and tighten these up a lot. So I can take these in. And again, I still need that 320, which I can get here at the 88 and a half. So I'll probably take this trade instead. I typically prefer rolling less further out in time. So that I maintain strike price, spot price sensitivity, meaning I can stay relevant to what the current price of the underlying is. So that is likely what this looks like. Fill. What up, fill?

The bout is said, I mean, it's kind of sad to realize how cheap that is, but I'm thankful for it. 38 looks unlikely to me, at least in the near term. What do we have? What's the probability? Let's say the probability within two weeks of 38, 42, so less than 50 chance. That does get a lot better. If we move out about a month, no, I'm sorry, just over two weeks. It's just a 46. And then if we look at about a month, that's where it looks possible. 60 and a half, 64 percent. So it looks like 38 is less likely in the short term. And I mean, that was my instinct looking at the chart, just seeing where things are. It's still doing a great job consolidating, churning, grinding up. This is exactly what we want to see, but this kind of behavior just doesn't lend itself to like really fast short term moves. That's not what this is at all in its construction. So you can see that it has a really steep aggressive trend line here, but it is not looking like it's going to lie up and out. So good question. This actually leads into the GME covered strangle. And what we need to do,",

This actually leads into the GME covered strangle. And what we need to do, which is I need more risks now, because I've since sized it up to 25k, we're only using 13. So that means I need to sell more short puts. Tommy says GME need to buy Bitcoin. That would cause a spike. Yeah, I think everybody's obsession with GameStop buying Bitcoin. Honestly, it's a little bit misplaced. Like I really, I think that there's nothing wrong with it, but GameStop is still a company that has to create revenue. And if it starts going around and buying Bitcoin, it again, starts to transfer more into a holding company, which could be fine. Like if that's what it wants to do, but that kind of company just takes an entirely different form than a company that's still trying to generate and drive revenue. So yeah, my opinion is that while nothing wrong with it, I don't think it would be the optimal move as compared to finding ways for the stock and the company to drive more revenue. I think ultimately that's what it needs. That's my point. Oh, two, I need to get our dinner order rock and roll in here. What are you guys thinking for dinner? I think Mel",

So yeah, good question. Reset. Hold on, let me get. Tommy says when rolling short calls with a ratio called diagonal, do you make sure to roll before they go deep in the money? No, not necessarily. It doesn't matter. They don't have to be deep in the money. You just have to track the the basis carefully. So a lot of it depends as always on how you're wanting to manage the trade and your disposition towards the underlying. But they can be super deep in the money. And it's it's really not a problem provided that you're again doing your math correctly. What I mean by that is if we go back to this and we think this is fine, I could do it over here. Let's say on the long option side of things, you're making 500. But on the short call that's in the money, you're losing 200 as it goes deeper and deeper in the money. This ratio, let's say that you have five here and two here, these started at an 80 delta, these started at a 30 delta. This like these aren't going to overwhelm these delta's provided that it's set",

Then yeah, just because you want to avoid assignment, but again, assignment doesn't even really matter because you still have this part of the position to offset the risk. So whenever you're assigned, you can just sell the calls. Because again, if you get assigned, your risk profile is literally the exact same because you have these, you're just not short options anymore, you're short the stock. But at the delta ratio is already set. So these, if they're deep in the money, these would be trading close to a one delta. You get assigned at a negative one delta, but that variance is already captured because these would be in so much profit. So it doesn't really matter. It's just slightly more annoying. So if you think that you're at risk of early assignment, then yeah, I would definitely roll the calls if I don't want to unwind the position.

H says, what effect is being added to the chain usually have on a stock if any? Notice 65 calls were added a few dates for GME, which I was scanning around and not really too much, especially because they're so far out of the money. So it's not really going to drive any significant underlying behavior from the market makers themselves. They'll just get added as liquidity comes in for them. That's why you don't see a ton of strikes offered on stuff that's super far out in time. They wait",

That's why you don't see a ton of strikes offered on stuff that's super far out in time. They wait until it comes closer in time where there will be demand for it. Reese says when to add kicker options, when you think the underlying is going to run a lot, that's the that's the easiest way to answer that. If you think it's going to be a slow, steady grind up, then kicker options don't really do you anything. But if something starts moving a lot, or if you expect it to have a big aggressive move, then kicker options, that's normally when they become part of the equation for me. Lauren says, Fubo did great today. So glad I sold my options on Friday. Let's see Lauren, how you did mostly want to see that you sold at a good point. I don't care what they did today. Friday. Yeah, I don't see why you would have sold Friday, to be honest. Not knowing, you know, that this was going to happen. This is crazy. This is just pure luck. But um, this is still not the right time to sell. I feel like you know this enough by now. You should know this. It's still going up. You could have scaled out a little bit. That's always",

And that's you continue to do that. You've done that a few times now. So I actually would identify that as something you have to control for before you put these trades on in the future. Again, that's not even accounting for the move that happened today, right? Like you can't tell that this is going to happen. It looks like it popped up out of nowhere. There was no expansion and volume. So I'm not hindsight being knowing it's going to go up to 506. Nobody knows. But the fact that it went from 1.26 to 1.37 to 1.46, like that's still the correct direction. Each day, successively. Lauren says, I sold it because I thought it was a dud. Did you define that before you enter the trade? Meaning if it doesn't do what I wanted to do in X time frame, then I'm going to get out. Because if you did that, then I have no problem with the trade with you making that decision. But if it was based on like a gut feel or just something",

It's actually why in Nvidia, why I took my ratio called diagonal down. It started doing what I wanted it to do. And I had scaled out on strength, which is not my norm. But for me, it was defined by time because trading a ratio called diagonal, there was a long option component. So if it's not doing what I needed to do in the correct amount of time, then I start taking on risk. So this is an example of managing by time, not so much the price movement. So if you Lauren ended up taking that down because it was like a predetermined spot for you to take it down, I literally love that. I think that's awesome. That's good following the plan. If it was random, which it sounds like by you saying I was cleaning my portfolio for the new year, then that's straight trash. And you are better than that. Don't do that.

This is definitely consolidating but not in the way that I would want. I need to change this consolidation scan. So I'm actually going to update this now while we're on here. The issue I have with the consolidation scan is what I'm specifically looking for are things that are potentially setting up for breaking out. The other thing that I use the consolidation scan for is to search for things that might be good for risk premium style trades. Because things that are consolidating, training sideways, they tend to have some sort of news or information that's pending that's not out yet. So I might update that. Let's continue A and F. No good. He. No good. Man. He chillin. Yeah, like none of these are really. I don't really like it. So what I'm doing right now is looking for generally long delta.",

So this will also get added to my hit list, the GVWGF. And what I look to do is have at least a few. Let me grab the chat, by the way, I can at least see you guys over here. Okay. David says GV is going nuclear. Is that a pun or are they actually like adopting nuclear energy? Did you guys see the thing by N Ron? This. Himmit. This. You guys see this? Micro nuclear reactor for your home. That is about as fucking cool as it can get. That is so sick. I didn't retweet this yet. I'm a need. A couple of these eggs. Fucking sick. The Johnson's look up their history. I mean, they've been around for a long time. They've had issues before. But super cool. I just thought that technology is speaking of going nuclear. That just looks awesome. All right. Let me get back into my screeners. VGS. So this one's on the list. Rocket lab. How's rocket lab doing? Ah, rocket lab looks okay. Finally. Soft breakout.

What is this? 798 and got the July's about the same with. Yeah, this looks good. 40 cents. The liquid on some of these though. I have to be pretty discerning. The atom ones are okay. The data is about two pennies. Two pennies all the way out. So I would favor the gamma on these. I would take something with like a three. Oh no, hold on. I'm fucked up. The data is three pennies. Gammas two. Yeah, okay. Gammas two all the way around. I would take the slightly cheaper. The data. Look at this bad Larry. Stop. Stop. Seven. Oh, lace. Initial stop would be here. 25. One. Oops. Add. 25. 21. This is good. So then for standard modeling, 100,000 account, something around half a percent, something like this. You get like a three lot. Your pain. Two pennies a day in theta.

I don't want to be at a 35 delta. I come in. These are also 35 delta. So I probably would take it. Take these or these slightly less. I think that's okay. I'm not worried too much about the theta because the primary profit mechanism in this is still direction. It's not for expecting it to be rotating sideways for too long. I just want to offset some of it if it does, which is exactly what these do. So this, for example, would leave me exposed on a penny. That's a jet. So rocket",
