    "text": "The election just wrapped up and there's a lot to be done. There's so much opportunity right now So don't worry about how you feel about the election. That's secondary right now Folks on how you can make money from what's going on because lots is going on We have things like financials are flying off the handle because of some of the deregulation expectations for Trump Probably positively impacting those we have stuff like the energy sector starting to turn out pretty heavily under the expectation of getting more into oil We have things like tech starting to regain its footing and almost approach three month highs Which has been pretty suppressed for some time now for kind of the same reasons in terms of deregulation We also have stuff like real estate cratering because there's an expectation of Rates being higher for longer 30 year mortgages just spiked because of some of the expectation of Federal funds rate remaining higher because of some of the inflationary pressures from his policies. So think about how to make money being out there. See you later",
