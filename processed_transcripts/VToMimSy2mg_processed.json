    "text": "I've been trading for 16 years. That means I have made a ton of mistakes over my trading career. The goal of this video is to walk you through 14 of these. And there's a specific thing I want you to keep in mind during the video, which is how many of these honestly do you identify with? I'm curious for two reasons. The first one is I'm curious how well people can objectively evaluate their own performance. But then the second thing is I'm curious how far along you are in your trading journey. And how many of these things you've seen because the goal of the video is to walk you through how you can overcome each of these mistakes. What's up everybody? Eric here. Welcome back to the outliers. Shout out to the Patreon family. Consider signing up. Let's get right to it. We have the first five right here. And logically, we'll start with number one. Trading has a deceptively low barrier to entry. So I use the example of a martial artist, of a surfer, something that's a skilled behavior, a welder, whatever. The punchline is when you see somebody that's really good at what they do, they make it look easy. Meanwhile, when you first start doing that thing yourself, not really realize how hard it is. It's called a skill gap. It's when you falsely perceive the difference between where somebody who's really good at it is and where you are. The reason",

It's when you falsely perceive the difference between where somebody who's really good at it is and where you are. The reason why this is such a problem in trading is because anybody can start trading. All you have to do is open up a brokerage account. And then obviously if you look at any social media, apparently everybody's always making boatloads of money somehow magically. And it's really defining your mental approach to the markets, which is a giant problem. The markets are difficult. The people that are really good at this stuff make it look easy. It's not. It takes time to pick it up. I like to use the analogy of if you are going to climb Mount Everest, you have to acknowledge the mountain itself. It's the same thing in trading. If you want to be a successful trader long term, you got to get ready to climb that mountain. Number two, most people I know, myself included, when it comes to trading, we have a just haphazard approach. What this means is think about this. If you learned anything in school, how did that process go? You go in the first day, you get an outline of some sort of syllabus. Then on that syllabus, you're going to see all the different topics you're going to learn",

Then on that syllabus, you're going to see all the different topics you're going to learn that are in a logical order. There's going to be some sort of homework associated projects tests, all of which culminate in a grade that evaluates your proficiency on mastering that topic. That doesn't happen in trading. You just start trading. And the problem with that is most people do kind of shoddy homework. Most people aren't testing themselves objectively. The issue you run into this is you kind of a really skewed perception and a really poor learning path with one of the most complex systems I can think of. An algebraic equation has a defined answer. A lot of stuff in the stock market is working with imperfect information, risking capital. So the note here is when you decide to start learning to trade, create a learning path for yourself. One of the things I recommend for option traders is to pick up a copy of options as a strategic investor. I'm not affiliated with Lawrence McMillan at all.

So the idea that you're going to just somehow bounce around picking up the right things magically and memorize it all because most people don't have a trading plan or a trading log is wild. Just as if you go to school, you have a notebook that you take notes in. You need something to take notes in whether you build out that trading plan to serve that purpose or to brainstorm ideas. You need to write your thoughts down. Otherwise, you're going to be all over the place. The next one here is completely perverting how we actually make money in the stock market.

And if you think about asking a trader, how do you make money in the stock market? A lot of them say like, oh, I day trade. Well, you can day trade and lose money. So no, that doesn't inherently make money. What makes money? Things like being good at trading directionally, whether it's up or down, being good at trading volatility, being good at picking good strong stocks that receive dividends or being good at picking companies that appreciate in value over time. It's kind of like trading direction, but on a longer time frame. The point being is it's really important to decouple the actual forces that make money versus the way you attempt to capture those forces via what products, whether you trade options, equities, if you trade bonds or your methodology, whether you're a day trader, swing trader, options trader, futures trader, yada, yada, yada, learn what makes money, then find ways to capitalize on that. Next up, this is a really hard pill to swallow for people. I started with a small account myself back in 2007.

You can't even sell naked options on a bunch of things because you don't have enough money. You don't have things like portfolio margin. You're also going to be flagged as a day trader. All of these different things lead you into this box that really forces you to trade certain structures that they might be all you have access to. Just because you have access to it doesn't mean it's optimal. You have to understand that. Rarely is a vertical spread optimal in any sense. There are times where it might be applicable, but if you have to trade verticals because you're a count of small finds, so be it that is what it is. But don't delude yourself into thinking that this is a good strategy that you're really able to scale over time. What you'll find is most experienced traders move away from verticals as soon as humanly possible, specifically when we're talking about options. Next grouping.

Dog, you've been trading for 13. You haven't even started trading yet. You literally, this is the infancy of trading. And what I mean by this is, let's take a look at this example down here. It's kind of blurry because it's squished down, but here's the punch line. If you take a look at this and you see that the last bear market right here was in 2009. And if you started trading after that, you didn't see another bear market for 11 years. 11 years. There's this reality about path. Path is how something moves from point A to B. We know equities tend to exhibit positive drift where they go up over time. But if you'll notice this chart of SPX over 10 years, there's periods where it goes down. And if you're trading something like this over here, T triple cues, I forget what time frame I tested this in. But in whatever this non-descript time frame was, it returned 39.5. However, the path it took to get that 39.5 compound annual growth rate included a 79 drawdown on your capital. So if you see something that looks really, really good",

So if you see something that looks really, really good and you don't acknowledge the path it might take to get there, there's a good chance that path is going to slap you in the face and shake you out of what you're doing. The other thing is you cannot accept small samples in anything that you're doing. If you're a trader, you should be back testing, forward testing, live testing. Those are not negotiables in my opinion. And if you think that you've got this figured out after 13 months, meanwhile, you could have traded for 11 years and not seen a market condition, a bear market, that's a giant problem. And it's nobody's fault if you don't get a chance to see a bear market over 11 years. It's just a timing thing, but that is a relic of the environment that we operate within and you have to acknowledge the shortfalls that this person, even if they had traded for eight years, they might have blown up their account trading the first bear market they've ever seen because they reacted in a way that they didn't know because they've never seen this before.

And it's kind of like a learning curve where on the x-axis, we have your proficiency. And on the y-axis, you have your confidence how well you rate yourself at whatever this skill set is. And you kind of start at a healthy spot. You have no understanding and you know you know nothing. This is perfect. Then you start trading for a little while. You've been doing it for five years now.

And you'll see kind of an example about this in a few minutes. The last thing here is a really great saying, I love this. It's strong convictions loosely held. This means you go through a lot of effort to build a conviction in something that's based on a lot of research. But you're receptive to new information. You are willing to abandon your position as soon as you receive information that leads you to do so, which means you are not getting entrenched in your argument. This is so common because human nature is prone to getting entrenched in our position. And that really doesn't benefit you in trading. You have to be willing to bounce around. Then we also have this kind of world where traders really forego taking responsibility. This is where you see things like Yolo traders or Lotto traders. If it's a lot of you're supposed to lose the trade. So if you lose it, who cares? That's just completely absolving yourself of ownership of that trade. It's okay to speculate. Speculate.

You weren't supposed to lose, otherwise you wouldn't put the damn trade on. So you got to abolish this kind of mindset from your approach in its entirety. Okay, the last group here. Be a trader. This one is really simple in my opinion. Traders all the time classify themselves. I'm a day trader, options trader, yada, yada, yada. So punchline, be a trader. Be whatever trader makes sense for what you're doing. Sometimes I'm a bullish trader. Sometimes I'm a bearish trader. Sometimes I trade options. Sometimes I trade equities. I trade whatever makes sense. Don't get wrapped up into identifying as a type of trader. Just be a damn trader. Next, these are four losing habits and you've got to read the study. It's called the behavior of individual investors. I cited all of the time. There's a couple of things you have to be aware of. Things like the disposition effect, things like naive reinforcement. These are your peers. These are, this is what's happening to all of the other swaths of traders. So if you want to be successful, it's important to look at what successful people do.",

It's also important to look at what unsuccessful people do and don't do that. So for example, disposition effect. When we cut winning trades too short and we let winners run, don't do that. naive reinforcement. This is where we focus on good experiences and try to block out the bad ones because your ego doesn't like that. Don't do that. Face the fucking music. Next, this is a really interesting thought process and I'm not sure a lot of people consider this. There are multiple ways to beat the market. You don't have to beat the top line performance every single year to outperform the market. I haven't done that, but I have outperformed the market almost by two times plus over the last 16 years. And it's by thinking through return path. So for example, portfolio one over here, it has a 7.4 average return. Portfolio three has an 8.6 average return. Portfolio three has a better return. However, portfolio one made more money. 142,000 versus 139. How? It had a 1.4 worse return. It's because it didn't have any big drawdowns. Didn't have any crazy great years. The best year was 10.

So think about the different ways you can outperform the market. It doesn't all have to be to the top line. Next, you have to abolish your normal thought patterns. This bargain buying thing where if you wanted to buy deodorant, yeah, buy that on sale, makes total sense. As a consumer, you're taught to bargain hunt. That's actually why marketing is so smart and everything is on sale all the time. The value of something's whatever the value is. But those are just marketing employees because everybody knows that's how you're wired to think about things where if it's on sale, then you should buy it because you're getting a good deal and that's part of your experience. It's all bullshit. But in the markets, it really doesn't work well because for example, in Nvidia, if you were waiting for a pullback because it's up too high and you wanted it on sale, guess what? You're still sitting on the sidelines. Then if it inadvertently has a big pullback, you're like, oh, wow, this is great. I want to get in here. There's a reason why it's",

Then if it inadvertently has a big pullback, you're like, oh, wow, this is great. I want to get in here. There's a reason why it's dropping at that point. Maybe it's not a great time to buy. This is just one example. Other things like getting wrapped up in these new tools like options flow when dark pools and algo trading, newsflash retail traders, we are the tip of the tail of the dog. By the time you're seeing this stuff, it's been out for decades. You can use these tools, nothing wrong with that. You're not going to find some sort of crazy edge in these kinds of things. You still have to make it yourself. The last one, avoid simple explanations. We went through a bunch of things here. Markets are complex. We have a disposition to discreetly summarize things. It is satiating to us. We as humans want that to happen. Sometimes you can do that. If a company has a great earnings release and then it skyrockets after earnings, you could probably point at that and say, yeah, it went up because of earnings. But never let that go too far because as soon as you start thinking that you can connect all of these dots. You run into a problem where you're now creating these different kinds of thesis that",

You run into a problem where you're now creating these different kinds of thesis that may or may not play out because you're dealing with an insanely complex system. And the only thing that matters is price. Where does price go? That's what you care about. So it's cool. Try to develop relationships with the products. Try to get an idea of how things move. Never get too wrapped up in your own narratives because it's probably only partly true. There's anything I left out. Throw it in the comments. Like, subscribe, share, be an outlier.
