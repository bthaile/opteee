However, this applies to any options chain because as you know, options chains each have their own implied volatility is and obviously they represent different durations.

And we can take a look at the next cycle, which is out in May. And you can see it's down here at 2035. So this represents backwardation. Hypically speaking, we expect to see future options or future explorations with slightly higher volatility than front. So typically speaking, this relationship that you see between August and September, this is called Kintango. And this is normal. And Tango is where the longer dated cycle has higher volatility price than to it than the near dated cycle. And more often than not, you'll see this kind of relationship where the line generally will slope up into the right.
