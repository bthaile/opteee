    "text": "just I can't I can't put heads or tails on it I don't know why this is the case the it's it's an anomaly like in the purest sense when I look at the volatility surface the fact that those two are flipped that much like you don't normally see this much crossing over of a volatility surface so to give you like a better example if you look at something like apple just something that's super liquid and if we take a look this is what a normal volatility surface looks like notice how there's not a bunch of these Kinks and random lines crossing over one another because this is more uniformly accepted there's some you know alterations specifically things that will include perceived events earnings coming up you'll see that where the lines cross over and really what I mean by when the lines cross over this is where we're expecting different expiration Cycles to have higher Vault than other expiration cycles and typically it just kind of ladders out very neatly like you just saw but if you look at this this is not that this is all over the place so there's a ton of relative value options plays like if you take a look at this line right here it's hard to see but there's a line right here and it looks like six up to me that's really really peaked out so you can trade those relative value vs if you're so inclined",
