Today we're just going to do a quick video looking out at the week ahead so that everybody's equipped with what's coming up, what to keep an eye out for because we are at an inflection point. That's what I think. I think that the markets right now are still very emotional in terms of the way that we're pricing and information. And I mean, you can see based on the chart that I have up here, this kind of movement is strange. And I looked back over decades to get some context because while I feel based on all of my subconscious processing that this looks anomalous, I also want to make sure that it's not just some sort of random emotional visceral reaction. So I looked it up. And this indeed is rare, this kind of movement. This is almost like what we saw again, much pare-down version. But this is almost like we saw during the COVID bear market. And I bring that for context because the COVID bear market was fascinating. If I zoom this in for you, you can see the period where we're just crashing as we're understanding the impact of this pandemic and yada yada yada. But the period that we actually set in a bear market was like three days. I think one of the shortest bear markets we've ever had at least in the last century. So because of these kinds of movements, it started making",

I think one of the shortest bear markets we've ever had at least in the last century. So because of these kinds of movements, it started making me curious about what's going on? Why is the market starting to have these kind of like really aggressive moves to the downside that's generally been the case? That's nothing new. You've heard the saying, I'm sure markets take the elevator down, but the stairs up. But in this case, it's literally taking the elevator down and then back up. That's look at this. That's exactly what this is. Now in this case, the elevator back up was brought on by a ton of economic stimulus, a lot of support from the fed. I don't see the support here. Obviously, the support loosely would be the rate environment and whatnot. But really what I'm highlighting is that very little has changed between these two periods other than and it's important to call out the Bank of Japan and the overall Japan economic system starting to chill out a little bit. I do think was part of this significant drop down and now the subsequent okay, that's been abated. Now we're coming back up. But man, like that's just a really big move to go through in such a short period of time without a really big catalyst. Again, I understand",

But man, like that's just a really big move to go through in such a short period of time without a really big catalyst. Again, I understand that Japanese economy definitely influences the US economy. I would argue that the US economy leads. But nonetheless, there's interplay there and not to overemphasize this move. This isn't a crazy move, but this is still 50 points that unwound over the course of two, three weeks essentially. And it really got super steep here. But then after again, another week and a half, two weeks, we're back up to where we were. So I bring that for context, not to say that this is right or wrong or that this is okay or not okay, none of that matters. The market's going to do whatever the market does. But my job as a trader is to do my best to understand what it's doing so that I can interface with it well. So that goes all the way back to my first comment that I think we are in an emotional market that's highly, highly sensitive to new information as it should be because we're at a really interesting point in our economy. We've gone through a series of stimulus that we've never seen before. We've made a bunch of moves that we've never done before from like the",

We've gone through a series of stimulus that we've never seen before. We've made a bunch of moves that we've never done before from like the Fed picture. Now everybody's just sitting here thinking like how does this go? Where do we go from here? At first, it was like no, it's impossible for us to have a soft landing. Then it was looking like, wow, it looks like we're actually going to have a soft landing and then it switches back again to there's no way we're going to have a softlet like nobody knows. So in those kind of scenarios though, it tells me that I have to be really thoughtful about the way that I'm positioning things. So if we take a look at the sectors, there's still a lot of interesting divergence going on, but it's in differing degrees. So what I mean by that is the SP 500 is essentially almost back at highs, where 10 points off of highs. The Q's is closing in, but it's still 25 points off of highs. So what I'm highlighting for you is a difference in recovery because if the SP 500 is almost back, it's again, 10 points of highs. Well, Q's typically tech, very well representative for tech, I should say a lot of people don't realize that there's other companies in",

Well, Q's typically tech, very well representative for tech, I should say a lot of people don't realize that there's other companies in Q's. It's just that tech is definitely the largest portion of the index. So we use Q's as a proxy for tech. So in this case, if Q's is not all the way back up there yet, it tells me that this move in spy is not being purely driven by tech. There's other things going on that's causing this movement and we'll figure out what that is in a second because again, there's a lot of trading opportunities here and then we can see small caps. We're not even, we haven't even closed the drop gap yet. So these stocks are figuring out if they're going to get back to all time highs with the SP 500 leading and IWM is kind of like just bouncing around down here. The reason why I think that's so topical is because going all the way back to this emotional market concept that I was talking about. Well, some people might say, well, the big catalyst for this is that we think that rates are going to get cut. Make sense. If we take a look at the Fed watch tool, the current probabilities for a rate cut are really, really high.",

If we take a look at the Fed watch tool, the current probabilities for a rate cut are really, really high. Let me drag this over here so we could look together and there's still sitting essentially at 100 chance of an ease and it's been bouncing between whether it's going to be 25 or 50 basis points right now. It's looking more so like 25 again for a while. It was looking like 50 basis points and whatever. We know that again, come 18 September right now, the bottom market is pricing in 100 probability of a cut. Okay. So then what's happening here? Why is this not playing? It indicates a slightly different tenor because what caused this parabolic literally record breaking up move for IWM in a two-week basis was the same thesis. This is when we started thinking that the Fed was going to cut. Small caps took a run as again, I was expecting them to. But what's been interesting to me is that now with rate cuts even being more of a probabilistic outcome here, they're not playing. So what it tells me is that there are other themes now that are coming into play that are even more interesting than just the rate cut because of these relationships. So I wanted to share some",

So I wanted to share some of that with you all. Now the other thing I want to highlight is this down here. Take a look at VIX. This has been one of the biggest slam dunk trades I've had this year. And I try to remind people that fading the VIX or fading volatility is not comfortable because it can go through extended durations where it's really moving against you big. And it's not a nice position to look at. But if you understand the way that the products work and you have patients, I've never not seen the VIX come back down. Let's go back out max. So this is the entire lifespan of the VIX. It has had some massive, massive jumps like this right in late 87. This is one for the book soup or super interesting. Oh, nine global financial crisis. Oh, wait, oh, no, I should say. And then we have global pandemic. Then we have this giant spike not to the level of global pandemic, but also not that far off. It's like 20 points off, which to me they're very different events, but still again, this really emotional theme. But more so what I find important to highlight",

It's like 20 points off, which to me they're very different events, but still again, this really emotional theme. But more so what I find important to highlight here is the fact that it always, always comes back down. So whenever I fade something like VIX, it is never, ever in the context of naked short calls or anything like that. It is just not worth the risk. And it's because your position will adjust over time. You'll have blowout in terms of your margin that becomes a giant problem. I always define the risk. This is a primary example of a position where I will not trade naked options specifically against it for those reasons. It's just structurally, it would work technically if you can withstand the move, but you have to withstand the move. And some of these can get pretty aggressive. So just again, talking about that trade because it's something I've mentioned a few times now, I'll probably do a standalone video on it because this one is quite anomalous. I've been fading VIX most of the year. We haven't seen a lot of great moves to do it on, right? Like the last great moves was essentially when we're breaking above 15. That's when it's been interesting thus far. In this case, we clustered a little bit, but this one offered a really",

In this case, we clustered a little bit, but this one offered a really interesting opportunity that I started fading into a little bit early, got ran over, but continued to scale into it because again, I know all this works. Now, the interesting part though is that the unwind was really quick, which I find again, generally interesting. All right, so let's take a look at what's coming up ahead. So when I look out at the week, I again, emphasize the emotional concept. Again, reason for that is because I think the news events that we see to me are more and more important. And there are things that I'm trading. I'm primarily trading with short dated options and stuff like that. And for the outlier pro members, the Patreon folks later today during the live stream will go a little further into detail on some of the things that I've been working on for these events because they've been providing a little bit more volatility than I've typically seen around the events. So a lot of my historical references for how I trade the events are changing and adapting to the new information that we're seeing. Beautiful part of markets. They continue to evolve.

So this week we have on the 19th, not a whole lot. We have the leading index Fed speaker, nothing crazy. But what I do want to highlight is we're coming into another week where there's quite a few Fed speakers. So on the 19th, there's Waller, then there's Boss stitch bar. The only reason I bring this up is because you're going to actually see differing opinions about where we're at. As you typically will see when these different folks speak, which is just kind of good because it helps me understand the way that the Fed is looking at things. Again, I think that the bond market at this point is going to start forcing the hand and we started seeing the cards being shown there. But I still like the way I still like to see the way that they're thinking about things. So crude oil inventories on the 21st, the meeting minutes on the 21st, big deal. And it's because we get more details when we get the Fed rate statement, it's just a statement. But when we get the meeting minutes, we get to see what they're talking about how they're viewing the information. There's much more qualitative information in here. So",

So this is one that I absolutely am going to be playing, but keeping a pretty close eye on. And then on the 22nd, we have a few big deal releases. Jobless claims, we're still very sensitive to that. And then we also have PMI, which both the composite services, manufacturing, all of those obviously looking at slightly different things and then all together. But again, any of these economic efficiencies or productivity metrics are a big deal. Because this is really what caused that original spike that we saw in the probability of a rate cut, because we were starting to see small cracks showing up. And one of the issues that you'll find with stuff like this is that there's leads and lags. If we're starting to see cracks now, then by the time we start making changes and those changes are felt, you're dealing with a really lagging system that can start to become pretty problematic pretty quickly. Now the Fed's preference to prefer over tightening and kind of holding it there long enough, I understand, because it's a lot easier to offer economic stimulus and some sort in a recession as compared to allow inflation to start",

That's not easy to do. We haven't seen a lot of successful iterations of that historically. So moving through the rest of this, we don't have a ton going on the 22nd, the balance sheet. I don't actually think it's going to be that big of a deal. New home sales change. This hasn't been that much of a hitter as of late. I'm interested for two reasons because I also invest in real estate. And I'm also looking for some more property now. But other than that, this hasn't been as big of a deal. So it's one I'm keeping an eye on. But to me, really, the big stuff from this week is going to come out on the 22nd when we're getting into more of those economic indicators as well as the meeting minutes on the 21st.

I did want to show you what fell off from the previous expiration cycle because we just went through op X and there's a lot of stuff that fell off. So now the new baseline that we're looking at for call. Oh, I is 455,971 contracts against 246,904 puts. Now one big difference compared to what we've seen historically. Take a look at all of these different colors. All of these different colors indicate different explorations. We do not see the front expiration focus that we've seen essentially since I've started doing this regular coverage of GameStop. What does that mean? I can't tell you definitively because I don't know. But one, I can tell you that this is different than what I've seen since I started looking at this thing. And two, I can tell you that it does mean obviously that there's less interest built into these expiration cycles.

Now the other thing that I keep drawing attention to because I keep finding it to be just crazy interesting is that the expiration cycle that contains earnings, which is this six six sep cycle because earnings right now is on the fourth before the market. It still is really low IV. So this is again something that I intend to trade. But the fact that the next expiration cycle, which isn't even a primary expiration cycle is just 13 sep. Or whatever reason has much higher vol which I just I can't I can't put heads or tails on it. I don't know why this is the case. The it's it's an anomaly like in the pure sense when I look at the volatility surface, the fact that those two are flipped that much. Like you don't normally see this much crossing over of a volatility surface. So to give you like a better example, if you look",

Like you don't normally see this much crossing over of a volatility surface. So to give you like a better example, if you look at something like Apple, just something that's super liquid. And if we take a look, this is what a normal volatility surface looks like. Notice how there's not a bunch of these kinks and random lines crossing over one another because this is more uniformly accepted. There's some alterations specifically things that will include perceived events earnings coming up. You'll see that where the lines cross over and really what I mean by when the lines cross over, this is where we're expecting different expiration cycles to have higher vol than other expiration cycles. And typically it just kind of ladders out very neatly like you just saw. But if you look at this, this is not that. This is all over the place. So there's a ton of relative value options plays. Like if you take a look at this line right here, it's hard to see. But there's a line right here. And it looks like six, except to me, that's really, really peaked out. So you can trade those relative value vols if you're so inclined. But yeah, this has been a really curious one for me to keep an eyeball on because the vol is you",

We got to see we got to see what the week looks like ahead. I'm eager. I'm hopeful that we start to see some volume. That's been one of the hardest parts about this is that I'm just not seeing a ton of volume in the stock. I mean, it is just as suppressed as you can get. One of the things that I did specifically for GM is I actually added a second moving average so that I could have some better context. So I still have the 20 day volume average, which is like that dark purple line. And then the light purple is a five day. They're both inverted, meaning the longer is above the shorter. So obviously tells me shorter term is much lighter. The five day average ball. And they're both negative sloping. So vol is still siphoning out of here. So that's the biggest thing I'm waiting to see is some vol enter the picture. As always, anything you want me to take a look at, I'm here for it. Let me know. Drop me",
