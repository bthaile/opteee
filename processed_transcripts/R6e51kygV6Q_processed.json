And you can see the prices that it's hovering on the 2737 and then the 2663 ish. And the reason why I highlight that is that's kind of the near term value areas we can see before it gets all the way down here. I still struggle to see a world where it would go back down here primarily because it's in a new financial position. So I don't actually think this would be highly likely, but again, who actually knows I don't. But based on standard analysis, this level here that I have drawn out the 2567, this becomes the next key level in my opinion, it's kind of falling on the next, like pre-key level, if there's a pre-key level, it's this bottom of this consolidation area, which extends over here. But this would be like the next like true key level in my opinion because this captures this entire new area that we've seen, this entire new value area, all of this is captured above here, right? That's when it's made the last stair step pattern up before it started consolidating sideways, up,",

Then that down move, that giant red candle that you see there is very abnormal. That doesn't make a lot of fucking sense. Normally when you see stuff like this, it's news driven. Some sort of fundamental change occurs that leads to a change in underlying perception of value. There was none of that. Now this is to reiterate a point that I've mentioned a bunch of times now that a lot of people seem to struggle with. But again, this is my opinion that GameStop does not follow standard technical analysis. It does not follow standard technical analysis. Standard technical analysis is entirely predicated on assessing supply and demand relationships. That's the whole point of TA. It's to assess supply and demand relationships. There are normal behaviors around those relationships. We tend to see and can represent those across a larger data set. GameStop sometimes absolutely will abide by those same norms. And we've seen it again, like even this move here. This is abiding by those same norms. But the reason why I say it doesn't follow standard technical analysis, despite the fact that frequently I would even argue a majority of the time it does is because the most pivotal movements that you see in GameStop violate standard supply and demand relationships.

So the reason why I say it doesn't follow standard technical analysis because again, even though it does, and again, I would argue the majority of time is because when it makes some of its most pivotal moves, it's clearly not following that same suit. Breakoff point at those key moments is exactly why it doesn't follow standard technical analysis.

I saw exactly zero posts or conjecture that on the 14th, the 14th, which was, what was that like Tuesday, fucking Tuesday, a Tuesday, a random ass Tuesday that GameStop would just drop by 10.

Holy fuck, that's incredible. Shout out to that dude. I feel like him when I'm observing the apes. And I noticed that a really common thread is that of pattern seeking.

That's the problem. Because we lose objective reality. Take this back to the technical analysis thing. I've done a ton of research now. I feel you guys will probably have noticed a difference in the way that I talk about this stuff from when I first started following along the game stop journey to now because I am now more confident in some of these things because I'm actually putting in the time. I know I'm putting in the time. I'm doing the research myself. So I'm physically seeing this stuff. What's really interesting is I ran a bunch of different studies on standard technical analysis in game stop like I would in anything else. I observed things like moving averages. I observed things like standard deviation channels, volatility, average volumes. I did a couple different oscillators. So I did RSI because that's my preferred one money flow index, stochastic, MACD.

Coffee Donuts says Susan Trimbet has done a few videos with Josh from the gist on YouTube by genuinely have no idea who that is. The stuff that I've seen from Susan, I think I saw one video with her. And then I think we came across her in the DD library. I was actually curious if we're going to come across more of her stuff as we go through it today. But I already looked at her work before and it looks cool to me. Like I, and again, I'm pretty sure that we'll be able to line up because it looks like her stuff is really interesting. And I'm wondering, especially with some of the new up and comences with like Chicago, change and whatnot, how she thinks some of the underlying market structure components are trending because I like, I literally am curious what, what her opinion is. So yeah, we'll definitely see if we can get lined up with her. Brad says, did you hear about the reverse repo? In terms of what? That's super, super broad. The reverse repo in general, reverse repo market is pretty expansive. I would need a little more context than that in order for",

Let's now, let's get into some homework. Shall we? It's been a little while. Right now what I'm doing is I'm just grabbing another tab with chat GPT because we probably will need that. And let's run through what we saw in GameStop last week. We saw a really significant pullback and I read it, I read it at the point that this pullback is seemingly not driven by anything. It's nothing that I can clearly discern. So what that then tells us is we need to take a peek at some of the underlying factors. One of the underlying factors I was curious about is if we take a look at GameStop and we take a look at insider transactions, which we know is actually really small, right? There's just every time that you see some sort of movement in here, it's not incredible. But there were some insider transactions here. So if you look at the sixth, we can see that two different entities were unwinding not huge positions, but some. So there's a bit of an unwind on some of these, but there wasn't anything that",

So we see two different groups here, Daniel Moore and Haymond, these two folks. So I thought that was interesting. Now that aside though, there wasn't anything else that I was like, yeah, okay, this is a really, really big change going on in here from like an insider's perspective. So then the next perspective we have to take a look at is an institutional ownership. So GME institutional ownership change. And let's see. This one's from Fintel. And if anything, it looks like expansion in sponsorship, right? As far as we can tell, for institutional ownership. So nothing really jumping out at me from this perspective. So as I looked through and try to find any semblance, any semblance of rationale, and when I say rationale, it doesn't mean like it has to be a good reason. But again, normally when we see moves like this, it's tied to fucking something. And what I can tell you is this is tied to something. I just can't tell what. And it's a lot of the standard.",

So I really, really struggled the other thing I had. And let's see if we run it really quick. I asked Chatship to essentially summarize all news related to GameStop and GameStop style stocks like it's peers on the 14th. So scour the internet for any news related to GameStop, GameStop peers, GameStop industry, or anything else that could in any way impact the price of GameStop specifically on 14 Jan 25. Let's see. Okay, so we just, we just caught one of them ourselves. Right? So one of the things that we just caught ourselves, and this is from Chatship. T, this is actually interesting because I didn't ask it this before. But the first thing that I popped up with is on 14 Jan GameStop experiences 6 decline is actually 10 it, not enough. But it says this downturn coincided with insider trading activities, notably the sale of 1577 shares by general council Mark Hamman Robinson on January three, which again, I'm pretty sure January six based on Banzanga, but same, same. Such insider transactions can sometimes impact investor confidence in stock performance. So that can",

Such insider transactions can sometimes impact investor confidence in stock performance. So that can be a thing. Here's the problem. That first was released on like the fucking sixth here. It's like several days after. So I don't buy it. The next one that I've heard come up a bunch of times were the store closures. So this is from the 12th. And the summary here says reports indicated that GameStop quietly closed the significant number of US stores after the holiday season, including locations in in McMindville or again Vancouver, Washington. The company has not released an official statement regarding these closures. Okay. So let's see the total impact potentially of said closures. This is again from the 13th. 150 locations closed 10 in the Pacific Northwest, not even through the first month, the 25 store closes keep coming. Let's see. The injury of dissolving the cat. Shording. We know that they're closing stores. We know that the majority of these closures happen in 24. So it's like again, I don't think that this is not part of that equation, but this still doesn't explain the movement that I saw. It just doesn't explain it. So I would consider this a contributing factor, but I can't clearly with a logical mind say, oh",

Now another thing that a lot of times people want to speculate, which is again, that's how we find shit out. I think it's good to speculate. But another thing that I see people talking about with game stop specifically is the fact that there's not been any significant updates from leadership regarding like what they're going to do, right? And it's a completely fair question, but that question in and of itself, I still don't think leads to a 10 decline. Again, to go back to standard standard technical analysis, standard behavior of equities, especially because game stops not even a small cap stock technically anymore. It's like a mid cap stock. What is the market cap? What is actually game stops market cap right now? Because I know that they have a bunch in cash, but I don't know what their actual market cap is. It's definitely over four billion and mid cap, mid cap stocks are two to 10. Wait, Joseph's 12 billion. Is it really, I didn't realize it was 12 billion. That's crazy. That's absolutely crazy.

How game stop? There is shit going on here that typically you can explain by something and there's fucking nothing here. That's bizarre. It's interesting, but it's bizarre. Okay. Now, that's the facade. Let's take a look at the options chain really quick. And then let me grab the workbook. I will grab the coverage strangle stuff so that we can take a look at this for the position. Because there is even if we don't run through the positions too much, I do want to ask you a couple of questions about the position that we that we have. Coffee says, how can they eek out a profit with less stores and no marketing to get people to buy on the e-commerce? Well, they eaked out a profit just literally because of interest. That's it. If they didn't have four billion in cash which does yield, but not especially for a company of that size, a not significant amount of interest. So that's literally the, there's like straight up the only reason. If they didn't have that cash, it would have been negative. So, and I think again, that's people know that there's nothing novel there. Here is one of the larger expiration cycles that we've seen. Huge expiration cycle that we've seen.",

And if we take a look now to figure out where is everybody positioning, you can tell that again, we're not playing the game of really near term positioning. The next primary expiration is 21 feb. That's this yellow color that you see here. If you'll notice that yellow color is quite dominant. There's a little bit of the orange going on. But if we take a look at that yellow color of that 415 change, there's 73 K there, 65 K in the front expiration. 31, no, I'm sorry, 61 in 31 Jan. So two weeks out, seven feb is super light at 26 K. This is all calls. 14 feb is 11, 21 still is the dominant expiration cycle that we can see. Next, close. This is 17 April. 17 April is another primary expiration cycle.

The thing I want you to notice is that a lot of times when game stop has these really big short term movements, you tend to see a lot of short term positioning and options. We do not see that here. Because we see that again, if we look at the 24 Jan expiration, it's like 65 C6 K. We find a bunch of different explorations now with that same amount of open interest, specifically on the call side. That's relevant because it tells us that the market is not overly positioning for a specific movement in a specific time frame. It's almost spread, not evenly, but it's distributed pretty well across all these different explorations. The other thing is volatility is now very, very low. The market is absolutely eyeballing something in seven feb. Is that maybe, no, it's not when their earnings is. What happens in seven feb? You guys know? That week, sorry, to clarify, it doesn't have to be on seven feb, but the week of seven feb. Because that's a big enough variance in the ball surface that the market's pricing something there.

However, yeah, it's like really, really put heavy on a comparative basis. It's actually favoring a downside move. And seven feb. So something weird going on there. Hands can't really tell what.

All right, so that's looking at the options. It's it's pretty mellow in there. And we'll do. What do we want to do next? Do we want to do a quick position update or do you guys prefer that in a separate video and then we just go straight into the DD library? Let me know. Coffee says new and retired from his job after you taught him options. He hasn't retired yet, but he's planning on retiring this year, which is going to be really cool. Yeah, the only thing that makes me a little nervous for him is that he. He said the magic words that always make me concerned for traders when he he is just like, yeah, it's like a you know an infinite money machine. That's that's not what it is. So I definitely don't want to see that potential issue coming up, but yeah. Lauren says maybe because everyone was saying that the chart looks similar to 21. That's still so interesting to me because we spent a lot of time last weekend looking at that. And the reality that it that it does not look very similar to 21.

That's not saying that it looks completely disparate, but it does not look the same. Yeah. The good thing is that we have a point of control here at 25. So there's a lot of volume there at 25.

This is what it reminds me of. It reminds me of old civilizations, right? Old civilizations that couldn't explain things through reason and through scientific method because they didn't have the, you know, the understanding or the materials or. The process to test stuff we would chalk things up to different kinds of deities or we could say that it's bad luck or you know a bunch of different things when we don't know how to describe something we tend to then lean on other things as an explanation for it.

Let me try and see and prove that this is the case. What I say is based on all the swap data that I have, can I regress anything that shows any sort of defined relationship between price movement and swaps coming up on expiration. Then we get more scalpel we say, okay, well, there's different kinds of swaps. Maybe if I segment by types of swaps, maybe there's certain kinds of swaps that will correspond with different price movements and stuff like that. And I just don't see it. So yeah, the idea of swaps, I do think that they fit into the broader conversation here somewhere, but I don't think it's the Huckleberry. I don't think that that's as dominant of a component as people might think that it is. Let me get rid of this. All right. Just seeing if anything else sticks out to me here not much.

Like that's exactly what this is. This is a squeeze. And then this is partially from earnings, but then this is also partially another squeeze. So these are people that are off sides and shorts starting to cover at these levels originally. There wasn't an abundance of shares around yet. So that meant it was still a little more difficult to access shares to cover. But we could see options positioning happening way back here, even before the cat dropped his shit. Once the cat dropped his stuff, everything went parabolic. And the reason for that is because a big thing that smooths out volatility in markets is even when you see really big orders come through. You don't know who it is. You don't know who it is or why they're doing it. But when somebody displays of really big position like he did, now you kind of fucking know why he's doing it.

So that's a lot of people that are just looking to exit out of their position so that they don't get stuck in that if you know they're trading it from the short side of things. So yeah, these are literally just short squeezes. And I know again for a lot of people, you know, this isn't Moas, this isn't like the squeeze or whatever you want to call it, but like these are unequivocally short squeezes. And there might be a gamma squeeze element to it. I think that that is definitely part of it. But yeah, I think that this is overall a short squeeze probably coupled again with some aspects of a gamma squeeze. All right. So let's get into some of this and then I'll just do the like update video on the position just because I think that's probably less interesting to people then going through this stuff. Okay.

Okay. Um. So shareholder meeting had millions of shares outstanding. We got votes of a million and a half shares. It's because of short selling. You don't even have to have naked short selling. I grew with that. I'll try to explain in very simple terms that you'll have a meeting. There are 50 more votes than there are shares outstanding. And if you subtract the ones that are held by management and long term mutual funds. Really more like three times the number of shares that are held by real people. So we're trying to get to the bottom of this and trying to figure out how do you stop this? How do you reconcile this? Well, the fact of the matter is even when you're when you're not naked.

If I knew for example a company like Hindenburg when they put out a report of some sort and I know that it's just hot air that I know it's nothing that I know that the company's fine and I know that this short seller who has a position because we know they have a position before they put out the report and they put out the report and I know the reporters bullshit guess what that tells me. It tells me that if I buy it because everything that they're saying I know is bullshit and it's just hot air I know that there's a short seller on the other side of that so I know if I start buying it and it moves enough against their position that starts literally to cause a short squeeze they now have to buy to cover which will drive the price up even more so all I'm trying to elucidate here is that I'm trying to get a short seller is inherently are not just this bucket of bad people that are spreading bad rumors and that's all they're doing there's more to it than that that's all I'm not saying that they don't do that I'm sure some of them do and I'm sure elements of them are predatory I'm sure some of them engage",

I just don't think it's good broad generalizations because we lose some of the really important nuance that we probably should maintain so same thing here I don't think that's the main thing I don't I don't align with is I don't think just spreading rumors is what will start to cause the stock to go down that has to be backed by something underlying that looks valid otherwise it wouldn't it wouldn't go. A great example of this is what Michael sailor with Bitcoin he's been saying that it's going to go up to like all these crazy numbers and all these really interesting time frames and it continues to not fucking do that and that's because broader market consensus is saying okay well I like Bitcoin it's good but maybe adoption is a little bit slower regulation isn't exactly where it needs to be so on and so forth so then it's not like this just surging at.

    "text": "it really quick to see if I can find the section. Absolutely it's mathematically impossible for this to happen except for the fact that it's not just naked part that's important to focus on it's important to focus on short selling itself when you allow people to keep reselling those. These imaginary shares to make loans you know I lend you a shovel you've got my shovel but if I lend you a stock you don't just have my stock you have a voting rate okay. So in other words it's mathematically impossible of trading volumes like this. What it's done is pumped in this infinite supply shares I can get bought by somebody all be it at lower prices so this is a problem itself there's no way around it it's not a mystery the numbers are clear they are what they are. So I think it's a real thing what happens when the meeting convenes and it could be people are feverishly working in their back rooms trying to cook the books okay. Interesting. Okay he's talking about Gensler. All right right. Pro States that he's hopeful we'll see change. With Gensler taking the lead touches simpler topic to Dr. E with legislation being worked on in the euro zone. Okay. Born voting. All right. Interesting. Okay. We have our next leave off point. What do you guys think. I wonder what the evaluation of Gensler's performance would would be. I think one of the things a lot",

I wonder what the evaluation of Gensler's performance would would be. I think one of the things a lot of people don't fully understand or like fully on board is just how much bureaucracy can slow things down which is probably a really big part of the expectations of what Gensler might do versus what Gensler was actually able to do. So that parts really interesting. But the main takeaways I have from that AMA really second a lot of the stuff that we're aware of specifically the concepts of the game shares we learned a little bit about the voting element which I wasn't fully apprised of I really hadn't spend that much time thinking about it. So that's an interesting learned point. I think the other main takeaway that I pull out of there is the fact that the system obviously it's run right now leads to this essentially unlimited liquidity source which again I think we know and that's part of the that's part of also what we're seeing with naked shorting and whatnot. So interesting. Cool. All right gang. I think that wraps me up. I got us a little over an hour. Absolutely awesome to hang out with you guys. I'm going to work on a video talking about some of the position adjustments",
