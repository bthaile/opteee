This essentially is the main volume node. And you can see the prices that it's hovering on the 2737 and then the 2663 ish. And the reason why I highlight that is that's kind of the near term value areas we can see before it gets all the way down here. I still struggle to see a world where it would go back down here primarily because it's in a new financial position. So I don't actually think this would be highly likely but again, who actually knows? I don't, but based on standard analysis, this level here that I have drawn out the 2567, this becomes the next key level in my opinion. It's kind of falling on the next, like pre-key level, if there's a pre-key level, it's this bottom of this consolidation area, which extends over here, but this would be like the next like true key level in my opinion because this captures this entire new area that we've seen, this entire new value area, all of this is captured above here, right?

That's when it's made the last stair step pattern up before it started consolidating sideways up down, right? Kind of doing standard game stop stuff. It's all above here. So that matters to me because if it does start falling below here, then that requires a bunch of different position adjustments actually from the covered strangle that I have on in there now that I've been talking to you guys about a little bit that again, we can either review or not.

Normally when you see stuff like this, it's news driven. Some sort of fundamental change occurs that leads to a change in underlying perception of value. There was none of that. Now, this is to reiterate a point that I've mentioned a bunch of times now that a lot of people seem to struggle with, but again, this is my opinion that GameStop does not follow standard technical analysis. It does not follow standard technical analysis. Standard technical analysis is entirely predicated on assessing supply and demand relationships. That's the whole point of TA. It's to assess supply and demand relationships. There are normal behaviors around those relationships and we tend to see and can represent those across a larger data set. GameStop sometimes absolutely will abide by those same norms and we've seen it again, like even this move here. This is abiding by those same norms. But the reason why I say it doesn't follow standard technical analysis despite the fact that frequently I would even argue a majority of the time it does.

So the reason why I say it doesn't follow standard technical analysis because again, even though it does, and again, I would argue the majority of time is because when it makes some of its most pivotal moves, it's clearly not following that same suit.

Like I, and again, I'm pretty sure that we'll be able to line up because it looks like her stuff is really interesting. And I'm wondering, especially with some of the new up and comences with like Chicago, change and whatnot, how she thinks some of the underlying market structure components are trending. Because I like, I literally am curious what, what her opinion is. So yeah, what we'll definitely see if we can get lined up with her. Brad says, did you hear about the reverse repo in terms of what? That's super, super broad. The reverse repo in general, a verse repo market is pretty",

That's super, super broad. The reverse repo in general, a verse repo market is pretty expansive. I would need a little more context than that in order for me to respond back at least with anything useful. All right. Let's now, let's get into some homework. Shall we? It's been a little while. Right now, what I'm doing is I'm just grabbing another tab with chat GPT because we probably will need that. And let's run through what we saw in GameStop last week. We saw a really significant pullback. And I read it, I reiterate the point that this pullback is seemingly not driven by anything. It's nothing that I can clearly discern. So what that then tells us is we need to take a peek at some of the underlying factors. One of the underlying factors I was curious about is if we take a look at GameStop, and we take a look at insider transactions, which we know is actually really small, right? Like there's just every time that you see some sort of movement in here. It's not incredible, but there were some insider transactions here. So if you look at the sixth, we can see that two different entities were unwinding, not huge positions, but some. So there is a",

So there is a bit of an unwind on some of these, but there wasn't anything that stuck out to me massively so. But it was two of them on the sixth around a similar time, which is kind of interesting. So we see two different groups here, Daniel Moore and Haymond, these two folks. So I thought that was interesting. Now that aside though, there wasn't anything else that I was like, yeah, okay, this is a really, really big change going on in here from like an insider's perspective. So then the next perspective we have to take a look at is an institutional ownership. So GME institutional ownership change. And let's see. This one's from Fintel. And if anything, it looks like expansion in sponsorship, right? As far as we can tell, for institutional ownership. So nothing really jumping out at me from this perspective. So as I looked through and try to find any semblance, any semblance of rational. And when I say rational, it doesn't mean like it has to be a good reason.

And it's a lot of the standard, some things that this might be tied to are not applying here. So I really, really struggled the other thing I had. And let's see if we run it really quick. I asked chat GPT to essentially summarize all news related to GameStop and GameStop style stocks like it's peers on the 14th. So scour the internet for any news. Related to GameStop, GameStop peers, GameStop industry, or anything else that could in any way impact the price of GameStop specifically on 14 Jan 25. Let's see. Okay, so we just we just caught one of them ourselves. Right. So one of the things that we just caught ourselves, and this is from chat GPT, this is actually interesting because I didn't ask it this before.

Such insider transactions can sometimes impact investor confidence and stock performance. So that that can be a thing. Here's the problem. That first was released on like the fucking sixth here. Like several days after. So I don't buy it. The next one that I've heard come up a bunch of times were the store closures. So this is from the 12th. And the summary here says reports indicated that GameStop quietly closed the significant number of US stores after the holiday season, including locations in in Mcminville or again Vancouver, Washington. The company has not released an official statement regarding these closures. Okay. So let's see the total impact potentially of said closures. This is again from the 13th. 150 locations closed 10 in the Pacific Northwest, not even through the first month, the 25 store closes keep coming. Let's see. The injury of dissolving the cat. Shording. We know that they're closing stores. Pacific Northwest Games upstairs reported closing in January 25. Close past Friday at 11 11.

So it's like again, I don't think that this is not part of that equation, but this still doesn't explain the movement that I saw. It just doesn't explain it. So I would consider this a contributing factor, but I can't clearly with a logical mind say, oh yeah, this is what caused the 10 dip. I just don't see that. Now another thing that a lot of times people want to speculate, which is again, that's how we find shit out. I think it's good to speculate. But another thing that I see people talking about with GameStop specifically is the fact that there's not been any significant updates from leadership regarding like what what they're going to do. And it's a completely fair question, but that question in and of itself, I still don't think leads to a 10 decline again, to go back to standard standard technical analysis, standard behavior of equities, especially because GameStop's not even a small cap stock technically anymore.

It's definitely over four billion and mid cap stocks are two to 10. Wait, Joseph's 12 billion. Is it really, I didn't realize it was 12 billion. That's crazy. That's absolutely crazy.

If they didn't have four billion in cash which does yield but not, especially for a company of that size, but not significant amount of interest. So that's literally the, there's like straight up the only reason. If they didn't have that cash, it would have been negative. So, and I think again, that's people know that.

So, and I think again, that's people know that. There's nothing novel there. Here is one of the larger expiration cycles that we've seen. Huge expiration cycle that we've seen. We can see that now total call OI is 459 and we can see put OI is 157. There we light. So that front expiration took out literally like 500,000 calls gone. Massive expiration cycle. And if we take a look now to figure out where is everybody positioning, you can tell that again, we're not playing the game of really near term positioning. The next primary expiration is 21 Feb. That's this yellow color that you see here. If you'll notice that yellow color is quite dominant. There's a little bit of the orange going on. But if we take a look at that yellow color of that 415 changed. There's 73 K there 65 K in the front expiration 31. No, I'm sorry 61 in 31 Jan. So two weeks out. Seven Feb is super light at 26 K. This is all calls. The 14 Feb is 11 21 still is the dominant expiration cycle that we can see next closest is 17 April 17 April is another primary expiration cycle. So that will tend to be a little bit busier. 20 June. The thing I want you to notice is that a lot",

So that will tend to be a little bit busier. 20 June. The thing I want you to notice is that a lot of times when GameStop has these really big short term movements, you tend to see a lot of short term positioning and options. We do not see that here because we see that again, if we look at the 24 Jan expiration, it's like 65 666 K. We find a bunch of different explorations now with that same amount of open interest specifically on the call side. That's relevant because it tells us that the market is not overly positioning for a specific movement in a specific time frame. It's almost spread not evenly, but it's distributed pretty well across all these different explorations. The other thing is volatility is now very, very low. The market is absolutely eyeballing something in seven Feb. Is that maybe, no, it's not when their earnings is. What happens in seven Feb? You guys know that week, sorry, to clarify, it doesn't have to be on seven Feb, but the week of seven Feb because that's a big enough variance in the ball surface that the market's pricing something there.

Let's go to seven Feb. It's on the put side. So there's heavy putski. What I'm showing you literally is just options detective work. I doing this from a trader's perspective is how I identify a lot of trading opportunities. Now, from a trader's perspective, you don't have to be able to explain everything. You'll never be able to explain everything, but I can see stuff. It's pretty easy for me to see. So yeah, seven Feb, something's going on on the put side in terms of where they're pricing vol. However, yeah, it's like really, really put heavy on a comparative basis. So that's actually favoring a downside move. In seven Feb. So something weird going on there. Hands can't really tell what. Take a look again here. Yeah. Interesting. Definitely a downside skew. In that seven Feb expiration. But do we have any idea? Coffee says funny watching Eric see the abnormalities in GME.

Well, the funny thing is is like GME is interesting, but it's not the first to do all of this stuff. I can't tell you how many tickers that I've explored and have seen have had very interesting movements. Now, there's some qualifying levels to GameStop that make GameStop a little bit interesting, specifically at size now. Again, you can find movements like this actually pretty regularly and smaller companies that have less news coverage and stuff like that. Information to screeness is a really big factor in terms of how things get priced in and how efficiently. But something like GameStop with as much coverage as it has and the overall size, definitely there's some things that stick out in a pretty big way. Coffee says earnings in March, nothing in Feb. Interesting. Because this is saying something's going on in Feb. I don't know what. Let's see if Chachu Petinos. Is there anything going on or expected during the trading week ending?

I'm such a big fan. Okay. Haggis says, why are more institutions buying GME recently? Well, I think it's because there's probably from an institutional perspective, it starts to become an interesting play from a podod's perspective. You have a company that's got a pretty significant pile of cash that has a really loyal fan base. So that provides a pretty reasonable springboard in order to make a move of some sort if the company can redefine itself. It's also sitting on a bunch of cash.

So that's the idea of let's say GameStop comes out and they say that they're buying Bitcoin. I know a lot of people really want to see that. I have to be honest. I don't really share that perspective, but if it does happen cool. And from that perspective, though, that can send the price just skyrocketing, at least in the short term. So people are probably looking to capitalize on some of that. Gabe says, I wonder if there could be a T35 in Fed. Is that what it is?

It's almost like, it's almost like old, this is what it reminds me of. It reminds me of old civilizations. Old civilizations that couldn't explain things through reason and through scientific method because they didn't have the, you know, the understanding or the materials or the process to test stuff. We would chalk things up to different kinds of deities or we could say that it's bad luck or, you know, a bunch of different things. When we don't know how to describe something, we tend to then lean on other things as an explanation for it. So I don't think swaps have quite as big of an impact as people tend to think it is. At least as far as we can",

And again, what I do is I don't say like, I think this is what it is. Let me try and see and prove that this is the case. What I say is based on all the swap data that I have, can I regress anything that shows any sort of defined relationship between price movement and swaps coming up on expiration? Then we get more scowl pulled. We say, okay, well, there's different kinds of swaps. Maybe if I segment by types of swaps, maybe there's certain kinds of swaps that will correspond with different price movements and stuff like that. And I just don't see it. So yeah, the idea of swaps, I do think that they fit into the broader conversation here somewhere. But I don't think it's the Huckleberry.

Well, yeah, that's in this year. This was a this is a squeeze like that's exactly what this is. This is a squeeze. And then this is partially from earnings, but then this is also partially another squeeze. So these are people that are off sides and shorts starting to cover. At these levels originally, there wasn't an abundance of shares around yet. So that meant it was still a little more difficult to access shares to cover. But we could see options positioning happening way back here, even before the cat dropped his shit. Once the cat dropped his stuff, everything went parabolic. And the reason for that is because a big thing that smooths out volatility in markets is even when you see really big orders come through. You don't know who it is. You don't know who it is or why they're doing it. But when somebody displays of really big position like he did, now you kind of fucking know why he's doing it.

I don't like short selling to be clear. I generally, if I'm trading something to the downside, it's with options. But I, there are still a there's still a purpose for them, right. So even if you think about vultures, there is a purpose for vultures in the just circle of life. So I wouldn't really consider them this necessarily. But I see its point. I think the main thing I'm trying to flag here is that this is what Carl is describing. I would argue is like a subset of short sellers. I don't think that that's descriptive of all short sellers in general. Okay, so they could sell why there's still life in them, then buy them back. Okay. We had a shareholder meeting had millions of shares outstanding. We got votes of a million and a half shares. It's because of short selling. You don't even have to have naked short selling. I agree with that. I'll try to explain in very simple terms that you'll have a meeting. There are 50 more votes than there are shares outstanding. And if you subtract the ones that are held by management and long term mutual funds, really more like three times the number of shares that are held by real people. Okay. So we're",

And when you see the stock price go down, the rumors seem to be true. And people act as if they are true. And that's how stocks go to zero. I don't agree with this fully. The reason why I don't agree with this fully is because of new information and information availability. The reason why I say that is because if all it takes is a couple rumors, essentially, to send a stock down to zero, that completely skims over the fact that you have to have a company that is not doing well for some reason or another. And from a fundamental perspective, doesn't look good because even if there's some ugly rumors milling about, that doesn't inherently send stock down to zero because there will be people at some point that say stock XYZ, yeah, there, you know, CEO did some sleaze back things. However, however, the stocks been pushed down enough and I actually think it's at a good value now compared to the current price. So I'm going to buy it here.

I don't think that they've necessarily built a business on ugly rumors and I don't know Hindenburg research. We've just done like a cursory overview. But what I can tell you is based on some of the prior names that we looked up for them, it looks like to a degree, some of what they do, I can't speak holistically because I don't know all that what they do. But some of what they do from elements that I've seen, they're literally, they're like detectives, some short sellers to zoom out from Hindenburg, but some short sellers literally act as a detective style arm that go deeper and focus on something. So Hindenburg, for example, with some of the stuff that they did on Carvana as you're reading through it, I can actually corroborate some of it with what I see happening from earnings releases, happening from management meetings. Like I can see some of those things. So yeah, it's like I'm not advocating for them and I'm not saying that they're not doing anything that they don't do ugly rumors or anything like that.

So as you see, woke up again, says maybe we need to look again, have this little thing, only a minute to read it. They published this big thing here report to the report of the office of Inspector General of the office of the SEC. Damn, that's a fucking mouthful. Shit. And here's what they said. We have stated it on several prior occasions. We're concerned about the negative effect of that failure's deliver may have a markets and shareholders and addition. Issues and investors have repeatedly expressed concerns about failure to deliver in connection with manipulative Naked Short selling, completely agree to the extent that fails to deliver might be part of manipulative Naked Short selling, which could be used as tool to drive down a company stock price. Such fails to deliver may undermine the confidence investor could not agree more. I think that that is exactly correct, which by the way, understanding of the year completely agree, completely agree.

They can lend my shares to anybody, make money, unbeknownst to me. I lose my vote because the disclosure is really very, very poor. I hear that some GameStop owners have been finding words, my proxy, words, my annual report. Now they get canceled out because they happen to have a margin account.

Interesting. Okay. We have our next leave off point. What do you guys think? I wonder what the evaluation of Gensler's performance would be. I think one of the things a lot of people don't fully understand or like fully on board is just how much bureaucracy can slow things down, which is probably a really big part of the expectations of what Gensler might do versus what Gensler was actually able to do. So that part's really interesting. But the main takeaways I have from that AMA really second a lot of the stuff that we're aware of specifically the concepts of Bansam shares. We learned a little bit about the voting element, which I wasn't fully apprised of. I really hadn't spend that much time thinking about it. So that's an interesting learned point. I think the other main takeaway that I pull out of there is the fact that the system obviously, it's run right now, leads to this essentially unlimited liquidity source, which again, I think we know.
