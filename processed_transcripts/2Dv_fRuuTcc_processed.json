    "text": "What's up everybody? I'm going to explain to you exactly how I go about selecting what option strategy I'm going to apply when and it's because one of the biggest changes I made to my trading It was revolutionary was not attempting to always trade one or two strategies because the market doesn't care about What strategy you like the market is going to do whatever the market is going to do so it's on us as traders to develop a toolkit that Allows us to take advantage of the current market condition So I'm going to walk you through how I build this process to determine what option strategy I want to use at the end of the video I'm going to walk you through exactly what option strategies I use in various market conditions to give you some ideas to start with So what's up everybody Eric here? Welcome back to all of the outliers a huge shout out to the patreon family and the YouTube members Thank you guys for the support you make videos like this possible and with that let's get right into the detail So the very first thing you'll notice here is process driven this is by design most of what I do has a process Involved and it's because it allows me to be more efficient and I reduce the variance What do I mean by reduce the variance? Well, it lets me identify what works in what market conditions because sometimes",

Well, it lets me identify what works in what market conditions because sometimes if you buy stock in scenario a and then scenario a pops up again and then you buy an out of the money call and then scenario a pops up again and then you buy a Deep in the money call and then scenario a pops again and then you sell a putt if you don't figure out which one of those works Best in scenario a we're wasting a lot of time So the idea here is to figure out what works in what market conditions against your preferences as a trader and then Cautify how we get there so for me personally there are two scenarios that I start with and what I mean by this is when I am Starting for a trade. This is the first scenario or folio driven What I mean by this is as I'm reviewing my portfolio I'm seeing what I need and this is what I'm reviewing I have a video that goes through portfolio management in depth So I'm not going to go through all of these here But these are some of the things that I take a look at so I'm going to look at the portfolio and",

Do I have too much risk? Do I have too much directional risk? But not enough total risk I'm going to review the entire portfolio and then look at the end result to see what do I need to change here And if it's nothing the other scenario that exists is an opportunity driven trade So the difference between these two is when I look at the portfolio and then I identify that I need something I'm already specific to what I'm looking for so what I mean by that is if I look at the portfolio and I realize ah I need more long deltas Well that immediately starts to narrow down what strategies are going to give me long deltas same thing with my gamma risk My vagarisk all of those sorts of things when we're looking at an opportunity This is typically going to be tied to some sort of event for me So FOMC meetings that's an opportunity. There's already a certain subset of strategies that fit that opportunity So how do we figure out once we identify? Okay, I'm looking for something based on a portfolio review",

There's already a certain subset of strategies that fit that opportunity So how do we figure out once we identify? Okay, I'm looking for something based on a portfolio review or something that's opportunity driven How do we pick what strategy to use? Well, it's simple for me the first thing I'm going to do is define the hypothesis And then contextualize the hypothesis which I'll get into in a minute and then we're going to fit a strategy to it a lot of times one or two strategies may actually work for a specific trade and that's totally cool But in this scenario, I want to walk you through first the strategies and then how I fit them to the specific opportunities So over here you get to see in general. This is most of what I'm going to do This isn't only exhaustive, but this is most of it So for bullish trades, I'm going to be doing the coverage strangle This is kind of a specific strategy that I almost always have exposure on in as for a whole bunch of reasons I'm not going to go into in this video You can check out my playlist on the coverage strangle I'll throw that in the notes below but almost always have this trade on so it's almost It's definitely bullish strategy, but I don't consider it",

It's not going to hurt anything for bearish trades It's essentially the inverse of most of these short call long put ratio put diagonal That's pretty much it and notice how I don't do short stock typically And it's just because it costs money to hold it and in general I can get the risk profile that I want via long puts or ratio put diagonals And then there's kind of this third bucket notice how I don't put neutral If I don't feel like rice",

So if I'm bullish in volatility meaning I think volatility is going to expand specifically relative to historic volatility I might buy a straddle if I think volatility is overstated like I very typically do doing FOMC meetings when big daddy j Pows out there slam and the hammer down on everybody then in those scenarios I'm probably just going to short a straddle Now the other thing to notice here though is that there are kind of these two words ratio and skew Sometimes I have a primary volatility disposition But a slight or secondary directional disposition So sometimes I'll skew these a little bit for the straddle Maybe I'll sell two calls against the one putt still a straddle But I'm adding more likes to it and skewing the risk profile in a certain direction For a strangle if I'm more bullish than bearish Maybe I'll scoot up the delta on the short putt all of this gets",

Do I think volatility is expensive? Do I think it's cheap? Do I think it's transitionary? Do I think we're going between volatility clusters?
