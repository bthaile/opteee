Even though you might, I mean, you look beautiful, but I'm going to take you for an Alyssa, but welcome to the podcast man. Great to meet you. Yeah, yeah, for sure. I had a I don't have any. My main setup for like all my computers and screens. I have no camera. So and then I have a laptop, but I used to do quant stuff on it and it literally blew up. So now I have to use my wife stuff. Fair enough. And then I mean, at the end of the day, if you blow up her stuff, it's not yours, right? It's just you didn't. It's like, I mean, I paid for it. So I guess I guess it wouldn't be that great after buying a new one. Yeah. Well, I like I was telling you right before we started recording. And then for anybody watching, I don't right now it looks like a little choppy for both of us, but I'm recording it to the clouds. So I think it'll come through. Okay, the audio sounds great. So if it looks a little choppy, don't sweat it. It's on our in not ours or not yours. But it should be legible and you should be able to hear us anyways. As I was telling him right",

And he threw you up in my discord. He's known as dad bod jelly belly, which you always got to love like a good discord or it reminds me of like on Xbox. There's like the random screen names and stuff. It's always the craziest shit. It's all like dad bod jelly belly, but that's what he goes by. So he recommended you and I was super stoked.

And then you started going down obviously a very different route than a lot of standard people go down. So I'm looking forward to dive into that. But you have a very non linear pattern, which is actually very linear for traders. All of us come from these crazy as backgrounds. Some of us very, very make sense and a bunch of us were just literally a band of missments. So you had your early experience went to the UFC. You were wheeling and dealing out there. You fought people. I think you fought Islam, Makachev, which is fascinating. I think I saw Charles Olivera, another pretty big name in the sport.

I want to focus specifically on the point that you dropped out of school because you mentioned something in another podcast that really stuck with me that I want to linger on for other people, which is the way that that impacts our self assessment and the way that we think about ourselves and evaluate ourselves and you've been able to overcome that. So talk us through that point when 13 year old you is like, OK, I'm done with this. And then where did you go from there? Well, what you're saying is not exactly correct. It's actually opposite. So when I was young, when I was younger, I grew up in a house that was full of not so good people. So drug, drug, lots of drug use, lots of alcohol use. And my stepfather was an evil person, essentially. And he sort of dragged on our family and he kind of put my mom in a situation to where she wasn't functioning correctly either. So because of that, like, I went to school, but not that often. So really the first the first 13 years of my life were that",

And then eventually, and then eventually what happened is I was taken away from that family. And then I should have shipped up to live with my father. Now I went from the ghetto into like a middle class neighborhood with my father who's a well adjusted proper businessman. And so then I had to get initiated into school with no background really. So did I go to school? I did, but I was abused and my parents didn't care. And so so coming up that way. It's like I was thrown in to high school with none of the requirements. So, so that's the lack of education part. And then my father put me in school. And then, and then I started to learn everything much faster that way.

And I mean, one of the things that sticks out to you or sticks out to me about you. It's very similar to what we find in a lot of military people is just adaptability, right? Like that right there is starting on the path of adaptability. So you get into this better environment. You start learning and you start building kind of your your base education. And then when do you what do you do after high school? What's after that? So I ended up learning the stuff I needed to in high school very fast. But I was a very depressed kid. So I was very tough because I was used to fighting people my whole life, my stepfather. We live in a very rough neighborhood. So I mean, I fought all the time. So I was a very tough kid, but like deep down I was very depressed. I was I was sad. You know, I didn't I hated myself.

You go through this rapid learning phase. You start seeing success. You start seeing some of the social recognition of your work. That's part of the fuel.

And that sort of held me back a long time. And it and it frustrated me. And it actually I actually lost some fights because of the business side frustrated me so much that it affected my training and it affected my stuff like that. But, but the fighting skills itself. I've always been an exceptionally good fighter. But mixing those two realms was difficult for me until the end when I got much better at it. It makes a ton of sense. It's one of those things where I guess like when a kid originally finds out that something like wrestling it or like you know like WWE wrestling and you realize that that kind of like skits right and it's fake. That's super crushing. I found a similar experience when like you realize a big part of fighting is obviously being a fantastic fighter. But you have to be able to sell fights.

Yeah, I mean, I mean it's a it's it's it's it's a bummer in a way, but it's a business right you have to sell the product and and I and I'm not bitter about it right like at some points I didn't sell the product.

Constantly we had this like stream of really hard fights, but when I would win them, they didn't get me the credit that I needed, you know, and so this I'm not complaining because I didn't come equipped to beat a superstar I just don't have the skills to be a superstar, but I am a very good fighter so I some ways I underperformed in that way. Right yeah, I mean well obviously it's also an incredible perspective that you take on it because it honestly reminds me of trading where traders I find in general they like to find something to blame the market did this to me the market maker who by the way doesn't care at all about you did this.

In my life and so what would fill that distraction sometimes is I would be like competitive in a video game or something you know like I play starcraft and I became like very good at starcraft like I became a grandmaster player in starcraft and it's like it's like I'm like. Ranked 100 on this ladder like I'm pretty good but then like one day I was just sitting there you know playing starcraft for like.

How did you find symbiosis between the two? Because at least for me, I become slightly myopic when I'm in like my obsessive modes and I can't really function in other things other than that thing I'm obsessed on, but you're doing like two very skilled things simultaneously. How did you find a balance there? I don't know how to describe it, but it's like they both feel the same purpose, right? It's like it's like when it makes sound weird, but the work, the study, it calms me down. It doesn't make me stressed, you know what I mean?

I'm not going to get tired that way, but my body can't compete with that level of thing. So with the fighting, you can only work out hard three or four hours a day. That's it. That's max. Now I would work two three three two up workout two or three times a day. And then like you have a warm up, you then you train hard, then you have a cool down, then you got to die, you got to go eat, you know, it's a 24 hour job, but that ability to be distracted in a way that's positive. There are lots of ways to get distracted as a fighter, right? Women, drugs, partying, eating, all these things you cannot do because it'll it'll suck the life out of you, right? So I needed to stay engaged. And that's why I would go to the video games, but then that that stopped producing the effort, right? Like then that it became like boring to me. It wasn't challenging enough. It didn't and it didn't get me anything. And so the market just it just sort of provided that that right thing for me.

I'm not running anymore. I enjoy it. But the initially when it started, it was me running from my past. It was me running from the things I don't want to think about. I don't want to feel insecure. I'm good at fighting. So that makes me feel good about myself. I don't want to think about finances because I grew up so poor. I don't want to be scared about losing it.

And the sound of like you found like a really good balance between both of those crafts, which is really impressive. I think that that's kind of difficult to do. So walk me through a little bit then of your trading career. When what year did you start trading and what kind of things were you trying in the beginning? Well, initially, I just started investing and stuff, just trading some index funds and stuff. Because that's what the book still made it do. But then one day I was just sitting there and I was like, I want to be a trader. I want to be like a hacker version of a trader. Those two things always appealed to me like that. Kind of like a computer wizard hacker type thing and like a date trader. Like those two things were appealing to me. So that's what I'm going to do. And so I studied how to do it.

What am I going to do? Sell it and buy. There's no other good ones. I got the good ones. And I'm doing well. But to really increase the alpha, the really to increase the chance at higher returns, I needed to go to other markets. And so I dissected and I started learning about what it doesn't exist anymore. I started learning about Euro dollars. I started learning about the volatility spreads. I started learning about when it turned to sulfur, sulfur curves. And then I started learning about how to trade bonds. And once I got those things together, I was able to use sort of this puzzle mindset that I have to really piece together a better trading system than just trading stocks.

And I've seen even from all my documentation on what I do, how much it's evolved as I change and as my disposition is just a man changes. So I think that's a really important point that you shared there about finding things that align with your disposition. So you were talking about a little bit of the evolution of how you tried different things. How did you start realizing that you were finding the thing that you liked, the thing that did align with your disposition? Well, there's two things, right? One, you make money. If you make money, it seems to make everything feel better, right? And so that you're making money. It's hard to be upset about it.

And I started to pick stocks and it's like a stock would just go down for no reason. And I'd be like this makes no sense. And like one time at one point, I had 10 trades on. And the market was up. And all 10 of my things were down. I seemed to own the only 10 things in the world that were going down that day. You know what I mean? And in a matter of weeks, I lost so much money I couldn't believe it. Like and everything went up except what I owed. And then I realized like even if you're great at this, that's going to happen to you. You know what I mean? It's going to happen to you. And so it just that feeling went away when I felt like I found the right markets.

Like that's I mean, in the grand scheme of things, I made 25 of our money. So I'm still doing pretty good. But like that losing that money hurt so bad that like I was like I cannot trade like this.

And one of the things that I want to draw out from what you were just talking about is this process of kind of testing ideas and then finding things that you are comfortable with. Because markets no matter what are going to experience what we would call path. They're path features. And they will go through phases of exactly what you're experiencing. And if you don't have something that you really believe in, it's so easy to say, this doesn't work. I need to switch to something else. And then as soon as you switch, what you were doing before starts working and what you're doing now goes through a bad path. And you go through this cycle that's pretty brutal. Now when you're going through and building the things, obviously you're finding your way into the segments of the market, the products that makes sense to you.

But it obviously is very clear that you also like to tinker with different momentum style strategies. I saw one on there using different moving average momentum style trades against the SP 500. So walk me through this process of how you consider building your approach. Okay, so initially, anytime I found a market I wanted to know about, I reached out to people that were exceptionally good at it on Twitter. So if I, when I wanted to learn about your dollars and sulfur, I found all the best people at that. And I sent them DMs on Twitter and I asked if they would teach me.

So like asset spreads versus each other, stock spreads versus each other, you know, if not in very simple terms, you could use something like ES versus small caps, right?

I used to think that was better because it's easier to just, if you want to bet 500 in an option, you don't need to stop, right? You bet the 500. And then you're good at either works or it doesn't. Whereas with futures, you have to be very technical. You have to pick the stop. You have to pick when you're wrong. You're going to be wrong more often. But when you get better at trading futures, it's like, you have more control, I feel like, over the ending process. And you don't have the drag of optionality of data and all that other kind of stuff. So I really like the futures markets.

I've done that essentially my entire career. But futures that there's a specific beauty to them in that. Plus, I mean, a lot of them are tax advantaged, which is also pretty sick. You get section 1256. So 60 40 long term short term capital gains tax, which is pretty dope. You were talking about though about the periods of your trading.

I feel I have a very hard time with that. So if I can push it out six months, I'm pretty good. Because sometimes I'm early, like I'm always like I have good ideas, but I can be early. And then on the shorter timeframes, if I'm going to use options, if I'm going to do like, if I'm in a trading option, I'm looking at 30 days, 30 to 40 days out. And then but I'm looking for it to pop within a week or two, you know, in a mean like and then get out. And so that's that's really the time frame. Sort of that five days, you know, if it happens in three, great. But sort of that five to 10 trading days is the short term. Maybe that can change to 15 if I'm going to roll or I'm going to have some future or something. And then I cut it off completely until we get over three months after that. Got it. And I mean, even that makes a ton of sense just in terms of assessing correlations. Once you get into those middle grounds, which obviously from your research, you already know this, but for everybody else listening, almost perfectly with the time frames that you've selected, those midterm periods,",

Once you get into those middle grounds, which obviously from your research, you already know this, but for everybody else listening, almost perfectly with the time frames that you've selected, those midterm periods, the correlations can behave very strange in there for various products. So you're kind of trading more persistent correlation and then short term, which is, yeah, that's awesome. I love that. Now, when you're looking at the way you manage your book, are you, do you have a preference for the shorter term or kind of like your longer range time frames? Like, how do you split what you're doing between those two buckets? I just have separate accounts for it. So it's like, and I do the measurements every day and whatever is hitting at the time I go for it. So you know, the markets are, they seem to go in patterns, right? Sometimes people are thinking longer terms. Sometimes they're they're very hypersensitive. In the high ball times, I'm going to be obviously on a shorter time frame. I don't need as much length to get the juice that's required to make money. And so I'm going to be shorter time frame. And then really it just has to do with the trade selection and the product.

So what I'm curious about is if you are completely non correlated to SPs or if you have kind of a lead lag relationship with them depending on how SPs perform. Okay. So, I hope I don't get lost in the next kind of explaining my thought process here, but in general, my goal is to be uncorrelated to SP 500, right? I have an allocation to SP stocks, but I want to be uncorrelated. And you can like them or dislike them or think he made it or not. But you know, there's that radaliotive sense that the holy grail of trading is to have essentially 10 to 15 uncorrelated assets streams. And then pretty much if you can do that, that's the trick to investing because you're, they're not related. It's very difficult to do that. It's almost impossible. I mean, maybe renaissance has done it, but that's about it. And when it comes to like, that's the goal. The goal is to have uncorrelated assets streams that you can trade that are not related to each other. And then you can look for the proper trades because one's not going to screw the other one.",

Now, do I find that? And he knows, it's very difficult and they change all the time. You know, I mean, you can have a certain asset and at least ship that's worked for years that it just falls apart.

So I think the way that you talk about it really, it sums it up really well because I also like to pay our trade. It's kind of a slower.

The very first question I want to ask with respect to that is where do you want to go next? Where do you think your next stage of evolution is? So the goal is going to sound rather ridiculous. But this is always how involved, how I thought about things. When I started wrestling, I started very late. It's very rare for someone in Minnesota to start wrestling in high school. It's almost unheard of. And especially for them to do good. But when I walked in the wrestling room for high school, I remember very clearly telling those guys, they said, I will be the best wrestler in Minnesota. And they laughed at me. Like, I, you know what I mean? They totally laughed me out of the room. And I went into, and then I proceeded to get my ass kicked by everyone in that room that day. Right? So they can prove the point that I don't belong there. Well, when I finished, I was the best wrestler in Minnesota. I was. And when I started fighting, they said, you can't drop out of school and start fighting and make a career under this. Well, I did very well. Right? And with trading, I, in, and investing, I feel like it's the same thing. And so I, in 10 years, I think I",

Is that the highest percent returns? Is that the best risk returns? I have many theories on this. You know, you could talk about this stuff all day. You know, like what, what is alpha? What, what, are you just doing leverage beta? Is it actually alpha? Are you, if you make 100 like are the risks adjusted returns?

Yeah, I think it makes it some of sense. And the reason why I ask that question is because you, you hit on an important point. I actually argue more often than not that like what quantify success as a trader really is defined by the trader. I really do believe that. And it's because there are different objectives and different ways to approach the game to hit those different objectives. And you know, one of my primary goals, I had like very specific timelines and targets for things because I knew that I was going to be my mom's retirement.

So you defining it for yourself, I honestly think is literally the the pristine answer. The second question I had for you to wrap up with is looking back over your entire learning process so far, if you were to give yourself a piece of advice starting over again, what piece of advice would you give yourself? The timeframe, the timeframe of what is possible in the short term is much smaller than you give it credit for. So you come in with dreams of making so much money, you come in with dreams of making like I'm going to make 10 a month or something. And you never really think about the idea that you would own all the money in the world if you could just do that. You'd be the rich, you could just compound 10 every fucking week. It's not realistic, right? So on the shorter timeframe, relax. But on the larger timeframe, when we're talking years, you don't understand what's possible if you just keep the momentum going.

Well, I definitely would love to keep in touch see that things are going for you. And yeah, man, it's so cool to hear your background.
