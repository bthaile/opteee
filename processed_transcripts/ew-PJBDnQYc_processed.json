I want to show you something this is at the end of the day this is right after the close it closed at 278.76 maximum pain was then 278. what happened Eric you just said at the open of the day it was 276 but then it was 278. alas markets move they don't stay static that's actually one of the issues with using this as a strategy is some people believe that once you understand maximum pain at one point in time that you're good that you're set you know where it's probably gonna get pinned to if it's likely to get pinned but the problem is is options move the vast majority of options 60 of them are traded before expiration it's an important figure because what that means is this isn't a static data if you want to try to use this it typically is a little bit more effective to be closer to actual expiration and then the other thing is depending on where maximum pain lives if we're 10 points off of Maximum pain probably not going",
