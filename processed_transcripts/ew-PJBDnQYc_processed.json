    "text": "Max Payne theory in options. What is it? We're going to talk about exactly that. We're going to start with what it is and then what it is then how you can use it. What's up everybody Eric here welcome back to all the outliers is shout out to the Patreon family. You guys make creating content like this possible. And if you enjoy my content. Consider signing up helps me out a bunch so as per usual I want to start with what it isn't and if you're like me and you were playing video games in the late 90s really 2000s you would think it's this dude which is kind of like OG to the taken guy it's the video game where his family was killed and he was a undercover detective that's not the Max Payne we're talking about today next we have that feeling you have in the bottom of your stomach when you open up your portfolio and this is what you see where you're down 94 all time that is also not Max Payne although both technically are also Max Payne. Let's talk about what it actually is. So first off I want to start with kind of a quick definition from investopedia you can read that at your leisure I'm going to summarize it for you because I mean that's what I'm here for and essentially it's the strike price in an individual series meaning an expiration cycle where the most options expire",

Why does that matter well there's a couple things that lead into that the first being this bullet point right here. The assumption we start with is that on the counter side to most purchased options are market makers they're the people that typically make markets so if a lot of people are buying options they're typically selling options and there's a reason why this is important it's because market makers tend to hedge their position so the ability to move rice at least somewhat but those same sellers they would much rather the options they sold expire worthless it's just a simpler transaction for them they don't have to move any inventory there's no weekend risk anything like that so the theory in general is market makers are the vast majority of sellers out there on the open marketplace they would prefer their options to expire worthless so come expiration day they are then incentivized to quite literally manipulate the price of the stock to land at maximum pain and I'm going to show you exactly how to find what that looks like on the left hand side over here we have the calculation for it there's a",
