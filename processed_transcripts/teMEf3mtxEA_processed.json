Yeah, I know you have a hyphenate a name, Anne Marie, do you go by one or the other people by? Yeah, I go by Anne Marie. Yeah, and my last name is Latvian. And so everybody has a really tough time with it. I can't even ask about it. Yeah, it's banned like rubber band or marching band or whatever the eye and the why are silent. What's the origin of that? Latvian. Oh, wow. That's cool. Yeah. Yeah. You don't run into a lot of folks, especially. Yeah, that's very cool. Yeah. And then I didn't expect to go down this rabbit hole, but I got to ask. Did you were your folks from there or grandparents from there? I'm curious how you ended up. We had really that name is. I was there for generations back and then so we've just had a lot of males in the family that got the name came down, but we're really Eastern European and Mediterranean. Right. And so we are a little bit of I wouldn't be surprised if there was some Turkish floating around in there, but we haven't done, you know, 23 and me or or I just had to ask that's really you don't run into a lot of many Latvians. Yeah. No, no, absolutely not. I am primarily German",

And then otherwise, thank you for coming on and chatting with us for a little bit and welcome to the channel. So you and I were doing a little bit of, you know, just level setting before we started the recording, just talking about kind of the purpose of things and whatnot and just to recap the ideas just to have conversation to explore, mostly you and kind of your approach to the markets and trading. So this way, whoever is watching the videos, the ability to just see some different perspectives and I think that that's really powerful as folks are trying to figure out or even redefine, you know, their approach to trading.

So we're a family of business owners and so we've no really maybe we've had two people work for other people, but most of us have been just business owners for a lot of generations and I'd had a couple of companies. I started as a neuroscience researcher, but that doesn't pay very much because you're, you know, low man on the totem pole and all I had was my background work in statistics. And so I actually took a hard left turn and went into recruiting and recruiting technical people like myself statisticians neuroscientists and then that moved into programmers and that's it space. And so I had a recruiting company for 14 years and I really was very tired of always being on and in front of people all the time and in a space of convincing someone to, you know, consider your options and then somebody flaking out or, you know, somebody popping positive with a cocaine screen. Wait, did you know that so you know all those sorts of things that happen out of the blue. I was just very tired. It's an exhausting place to work, but I learned a lot",

I just said, you know what I want to do something different. My husband said, hey, why don't you look at this. Let's go check this out. And so we saw trading seminar. I can't even remember where it was been so long ago. I was in 2005. And I thought to myself, how hard could this be because of course everything was in hindsight. They were drawing the little pictures and they said, no, this is where you would buy and this is where you would sell and I thought, man, even a monkey could do this. I'm perfect. I said to myself, I will take all the money that I've been saving and working with having a business for 14 years. And I'm going to just absolutely go straight into the market and I can do this. I can do anything. Right. A lot of confidence in myself lost millions of dollars because I figured out that it's not as easy.

And then I stepped back and I tried to figure out what what do you know to be true. What is anecdotal and what is statistically significant. And what I found out through the years is most of the stuff that we think about in terms of giving us direction. It's anecdotal. It's and by that, I mean, it's the closest thing that you can pick up and go, oh, you know what, the last two times I saw that this happened. And so obviously that's the relationship. One of the best books that I ever read was the book thinking fast and slow by Daniel. I love that book. Yeah. And I think it's really fantastic. My fiancee. She actually turned me on to it.

And he's a professor out of the University of Texas at Houston. He's a professor of neuroscience work and he says, listen, the brain does not like anything that's not solid. So you can look at a landscape and your brain will actually only see your mind will only connect two or three things and your brain fills in the rest with whatever it is. And so we have this tendency to believe that we're seeing a full picture in the moment in time. So when after the fact we go there and we go, why didn't I see that it could be that your brain never saw it in the first place. It just glossed over that edge. It's sort of like that. Have you have you read that quick little book called the invisible gorilla? Oh, yeah, yeah, I saw the video on it, but the book was really about how much the brain can miss when it's not a paying attention to a specific thing and how I witnessed testimonies like the worst testimony ever.

And then after the fact, because everything is static and not dynamic, it's no longer moving, my brain says, oh, obviously this must have been there then and I should have seen this and this is what I need to do. And so they're really two completely disconnected systems. And when you're an active day trader like me, I was just losing gobs of money before my husband said to me, I think you should stop because I'm not really sure you know what you're doing, which you know, my best and greatest confidant is my my husband. So when he said that to me, it was vastly offended, but it was absolutely true, absolutely true. And it sent me on that journey of pulling in all the things I'd learned about how people were from 14 years in the recruiting business and then pulling all the mathematics of hey, how do you actually solve a problem? You go one, two, three, four, and where the area is gray, what you do is have a series of if then statements, right. So",

So that's how I started looking at the market and one of the most fabulous things I ever read was the biography of John Boyd, who was the current Oodle loop, yep. Yes. And the Oodle loop is a part of my every day motion. You got to be a marine then because that's like one of our central principles is the loop. You know, Marines were the only people that showed up to his funeral. Nobody from the Air Force did. So I just love the guy because he just, I mean the focal strength to do to make something so incredibly complex just come down into these tight things that go one, two, three, four, and then stop and make sure you go through. Hey, you've observed, but did you actually orient and that's what we don't do. We observe all the time, but it's that orientation that gives us trouble. Oh, we just crossed over the 50. Yeah, well, that's great. Is that 50 trending up or down is the overall motion of the market coming off of the deep support or hard resistance.

And so for me, it always comes back to listen, can you see what the players are doing. If you can't tell what the players are doing, you better sit on your hands because the number one thing for me is I'll think to myself, all right, here's what you're thinking you're thinking that when it gets to hear a bunch of sellers are going to come in. And if they come in, then it's going to drive it down to this level of support and you'll be able to turn around and move back up with the direction of the overall trend. And so I used to plan everything out and then take the trade and then go what happened because I was never thinking about my opponent. What was the other side of the equation doing to circumvent my path to where it was that I was going. And so for me, I've stopped looking at the market in terms of indicators, but more of OK, a lot of traders accomplished X today, like for instance, in the futures, we had a support edge that really came down and tested.

We went in and this was our objective, 123, 4, we're going to hit these and we get to hear and it's going to be mission accomplished. We're out of there, right. And so when that happens, the balance will shift between the buyers gaining more force because the sellers have accomplished their goal. They're headed back up the hill to find the next resistance spot that they can do it again. And so for me, it's always about the game of the storyboard of players as opposed to look at this crossing this look at that crossing that that storyboard helps me synthesize. Much more accurately than simply looking at a group of technicals or just looking at price. Yeah, and that's definitely interesting. And you started dovetailing kind of into another topic I want to hit before I do that.

When you first started trading, what was your general approach, if you could just summarize it, I don't need specifics or anything. Wow, you know, I would, I was sort of like a cocker Spaniel looking at a bunch of birds outside the window. And so it was, I'll try that I'll try this I'll try that. And so although I thought I had a strategy, I really didn't right. I did not approach the market in a systematic way. I thought about the market.

So when you have a lot of cash, you lose some of it and you, well, that stinks, but it's okay. I got it. Right. And then it happens again and you know, that's terrible, but I got it.

If you don't get in at just the right spot. You're going to sit on a heavy bit of risk. And so. Making my sense of what I'm going to do is to get a little bit of risk.

There are really things like that. And one of the things that I also found interesting is, you know, when you were sharing a little bit about your original approach. Like when you're sharing something about the price, something like that. You're sort of over the plate. Yes. Yes. Yes. I, I find that very interesting, because I think for just about all of us, because I started with like, no money. And for a lot of us that first starting out. It's like we were doing the same exact thing, just with less money. Yeah. And you kind of hit on that as well. It's the 1 to 2,000 example. Yeah. So I think that. to learn about is obviously you had your trade logs or, you know, your record forever and then at some point your husband's the one that said, well, maybe we should shift gears a little bit and try something different.

Sure I like I trade the futures because of the leverage. Yep I love the leverage and you know leverage works for you when you know what you're doing and against you when you don't or you get yourself in a pickle but I like that and what I've noticed is even though I trade intraday several times a day yep I always look at the following I look at how did this instrument close on the quarter right what is the high what is the low what's the open what's the close how did it close last month high low open close and so I'll do everything and I'll map those on my chart and I will not count overnight trading so I will put a chart that",
