Yeah, I know you have a hyphenate a name, Anne Marie, do you go by one or the other people by? Yeah, I go by Anne Marie. Yeah, and my last name is Latvian. And so everybody has a really tough time with it. I can't even ask about it. Yeah, it's banned like rubber band or marching band or whatever the eye and the why are silent. What's the origin of that? Latvian. Oh, wow. That's cool. Yeah. Yeah. You don't run into a lot of folks, especially. Yeah, that's very cool. Yeah. And then I didn't expect to go down this rabbit hole, but I got to ask. Did you were your folks from there or grandparents from there? I'm curious how you ended up. We had really that name is. I was there for generations back and then so we've just had a lot of males in the family that got the name came down, but we're really Eastern European and Mediterranean. Right. And so we are a little bit of I wouldn't be surprised if there was some Turkish floating around in there, but we haven't done, you know, 23 and me or or I just had to ask that's really you don't run into a lot of many Latvians.

And then otherwise, thank you for coming on and chatting with us for a little bit and welcome to the channel. So you and I were doing a little bit of, you know, just level setting before we started the recording, just talking about kind of the purpose of things and whatnot and just to recap the ideas just to have conversation to explore, mostly you and kind of your approach to the markets and trading. So this way, whoever is watching the videos, the ability to just see some different perspectives and I think that that's really powerful as folks are trying to figure out or even redefine, you know, their approach to trading.

So we're a family of business owners and so we've no really maybe we've had two people work for other people, but most of us have been just business owners for a lot of generations and I'd had a couple of companies. I started as a neuroscience researcher, but that doesn't pay very much because you're, you know, low man on the totem pole and all I had was my background work in statistics. And so I actually took a hard left turn and went into recruiting and recruiting technical people like myself statisticians neuroscientists and then that moved into programmers and that's it space. And so I had a recruiting company for 14 years and I really was very tired of always being on and in front of people all the time and in a space of convincing someone to, you know, consider your options and then somebody flaking out or, you know, somebody popping positive with a cocaine screen. Wait, did you know that so you know all those sorts of things that happen out of the blue. I was just very tired. It's an exhausting place to work, but I learned a lot",

They were drawing the little pictures and they said, no, this is where you would buy and this is where you would sell and I thought, man, even a monkey could do this. I'm perfect. I said to myself, I will take all the money that I've been saving and working with having a business for 14 years. And I'm going to just absolutely go straight into the market and I can do this.

And then I stepped back and I tried to figure out what what do you know to be true. What is anecdotal and what is statistically significant. And what I found out through the years is most of the stuff that we think about in terms of giving us direction. It's anecdotal.

And he's a professor out of the University of Texas at Houston. He's a professor of neuroscience work and he says, listen, the brain does not like anything that's not solid. So you can look at a landscape and your brain will actually only see your mind will only connect two or three things and your brain fills in the rest with whatever it is. And so we have this tendency to believe that we're seeing a full picture in the moment in time. So when after the fact we go there and we go, why didn't I see that it could be that your brain never saw it in the first place. It just glossed over that edge. It's sort of like that. Have you have you read that quick little book called the invisible gorilla?

So that's how I started looking at the market and one of the most fabulous things I ever read was the biography of John Boyd, who was the current Oodle loop, yep. Yes. And the Oodle loop is a part of my every day motion. You got to be a marine then because that's like one of our central principles is the loop. You know, Marines were the only people that showed up to his funeral. Nobody from the Air Force did. So I just love the guy because he just, I mean the focal strength to do to make something so incredibly complex just come down into these tight things that go one, two, three, four, and then stop and make sure you go through. Hey, you've observed, but did you actually orient and that's what we don't do. We observe all the time, but it's that orientation that gives us trouble. Oh, we just crossed over the 50.

And so for me, it always comes back to listen, can you see what the players are doing. If you can't tell what the players are doing, you better sit on your hands because the number one thing for me is I'll think to myself, all right, here's what you're thinking you're thinking that when it gets to hear a bunch of sellers are going to come in. And if they come in, then it's going to drive it down to this level of support and you'll be able to turn around and move back up with the direction of the overall trend.

We went in and this was our objective, 123, 4, we're going to hit these and we get to hear and it's going to be mission accomplished. We're out of there, right.

And I love the option space. I think options will turn a flat surface into a fully three dimensional topology. We can see all the landscape and just everything. And you can move and manipulate gears. Absolutely loved it. And so I began playing with options, not realizing how much damage you can do to yourself. See, because I had a lot of cash. So when you have a lot of cash, you lose some of it and you, well, that stinks, but it's okay. I got it. Right. And then it happens again and you know, that's terrible, but I got it. And you almost, you forget how long it took to put it away. And then it was a lot of money. And then it was a lot of money. Which was a travesty, right? Because it took me 18 months to lose millions of dollars and, you know, six years. I was, you know, a lot of money. I was losing millions of dollars. I was losing millions of dollars because, uh, loose with my risk as say the person who comes in with a thousand dollars and says, hey, you know, I want to, I want to turn this into two thousand bucks by the end of the month, I'm like, well, good",

But people forget that risk and reward is on a thread. And it was high. Yes. And so when you look at those things and you're okay, well, I want my reward to be this, well, your risk is not only going to expand by that same amount, but by even more. And so, you know, the thing that, so what I did poorly was, I overestimated my ability. I overestimated the knowledge that I thought I had. I overestimated the fact that I thought my intellect could take me through the emotional space. Listen, there's nothing, there's not a worst gut punch than really studying and putting a position in and it going absolutely sideways. Right. And so that sort of, you know, all of that, if I could build a list of, please don't do this. It would be the first 18 months of my career and every single thing I did. The only thing I've never done is going all in on margin or I probably wouldn't be here today. Right. I stopped with enough capital that I didn't blow anything up.

What simple things can you look at and go, okay, when this happens and the probability of this happening is higher based on X. So everything I went right back to my statistical background and said, let's just look at this as a game of cards, a game of probabilities, a game of dice rolling and just take a look at these correlations, not causations, but correlations and work from that. And so that really has been my bread and butter. It's what's allowed me to stay in and stay green and continually trend up. The biggest thing that's happening right now in the markets though is there's so much intraday volatility that even if you know where the cycles are going to run, if you don't get in at just the right spot, you're going to sit on a heavy bit of risk. And so making my cycles just a little bit smaller these days because I think the market is different than I've ever seen it. It's funny.

And one of the things that I also found interesting is, you know, when you were sharing a little bit about your original approach, where it was just kind of like shotgun blast, you know, all over the place, different things. I find that very interesting because I think for just about all of us, because I started with like no money. And for a lot of us that first starting out, it's like we were doing the same exact thing just with less money. Yeah. And you kind of hit on that as well with the one to 2,000 example. Yeah.

Well, you know the hard thing, sorry. No, please. No, no, no. I think the hard thing for us is to look at the difficult things or the things that we aren't doing right and not judge ourselves. The judging event creates an internal space of mental division, you idiot, you moron, you, what the heck were you looking at, that sort of thing. If you, if you say to yourself, all right, if my goal is always self-improvement and we know that trading makes us better human beings, right? It does because it makes us look at ourselves and go, why did you just do that? And so if you can look at yourself without judgment and say, listen, this you did incorrectly. Let's look at why. And you strip that judgment, finger pointing thing that we have a tendency to do because we, we're just terrible to ourselves. And my philosophy is always, I tell my kids all the time, listen, do your best not to have negative self-talk because there's going to be somebody out",

I like to work out and his saying is, you know, everybody wants to be a bodybuilder, but nobody, nobody want to lift this heavy ass weight. It's the same thing. Everybody ready to make a buck.

Yeah. And that's one of the things that I talk a lot about. And at the end of the day, I think the number one trait of a long-term traitor is there a risk manager that's it's got to come first.

You know, you can go as far in depth or as not far in depth as you want, but I would love to just learn a little bit more about your approach to the markets. Sure. I like, I trade the futures because of the leverage. I love the leverage. And you know, leverage works for you when you know what you're doing and against you when you don't. Or you get yourself in a pickle, but I like that. And what I've noticed is even though I trade intra-day, several times a day, I always look at the following. I look at how did this instrument close on the quarter? Right. What is the high? What is the low? What's the open? What's the close? How did it close last month? High, low, open, close.

So let's take a look at the ES. Okay. Okay. And so the ES had a spike up into 37, 14 or 37, 16 a couple of days ago. And that actually was the gamma traders sort of told us what was going on with this. What there's a really side note. There's a very interesting. I'm going to send you some stuff on gamma. Cool.

That means it's strength if it's up over the close of the prior day. And did you got a toy? Yeah, I just saw him with popcorn. He's just whipping that thing around. Sorry. Oh no. I do. I absolutely love animals. So we take a look at the strength. The moment it starts losing either the high or the close, we have to think about why. Right. But why does price lose a level anyway? It means that the pressure of sellers is more than the pressure of buyers. Now there's this storyboard where people go, you know, for every seller there's a buyer. Yes, of course. We know that to be true. However, there are sellers that have the ability to sell five contracts and sellers that have the ability to sell 5,000 contracts.

My thought is always to push the envelope enough that you feel like you're really having to be fully engaged, but not so much that you've got butterflies in your space. Right. That you're stressed out and what. Because what happens from a biological space, what happens is that floods the brain with cortisol. And cortisol short circuits the prefrontal cortex. The prefrontal cortex is where we make all complex decisions. And so I really try to not get myself in that kind of space where my emotions are going to make me click the button when I shouldn't be. Yeah. I think that that's another great point. Do you, when you're kind of doing your daily trades, do you like to trade futures outright? Or do you trade options on futures? I like to trade the futures outright. You know, I don't know why I never pick the futures options. I know there's even more leverage there. I just don't know why I haven't done it. Yeah, it's definitely something that I like to take a look at. If if I'm just intraday scalping, I will tend to just trade the future itself. And the main reason there is just liquidity. It's a little easier. Yeah. But if I'm looking at any sort of slightly longer term style trade, I'll typically go to options",

Does it take longer for the settlement of the futures option versus the future? And it depends on obviously on what you're trading, what the settlement style is, cash for the major indices that settle to cash, same same. And then for the kind of commodities backed product stuff like that, it'll just settle to the futures contract itself. And then whenever that contract is due to expire, then whatever will happen on that underlying contract. Yeah, based on the contract itself. Yeah, somebody just said that to me a couple of weeks ago, they were like, why don't you do the options? And I just listen, I love options. I do. I just have not ever looked. We'll have to we'll have to chat offline about a couple of those things because yeah, I just want to. Yeah. Yeah, happy to. I think that they're they're really cool products, the options on futures.

So with our last few minutes here, there's two other questions I wanted to ask you. The first one is what did you think about the past year? Certainly one for the record books. Um, for me, I'm a sort of very pragmatic. I think to myself, what can I do to change what's happening here in my personal space? Right? Is there anything I can do to affect or influence anything big? And it turns out like, no, I can't. And so I have this thought in my mind of, you know, I really can't do anything. So I'm not going to fret about it. I'm just going to I'm going to chill. Somebody wants me to do this. Fine. My thought is, especially with a family and that sort of thing, my thought is, can I keep the people around me from spinning up? Because we're all sort of, I don't know, we're a family that's very, and so I have to go, wait, let's, can we just calm down? We can't, we can, you know, like the the theories, especially my sons, they are just, I'm like, wait a second. We can't change any of that.

Am I concerned about what I perceive happening? Yes. Sure. And so I try to be as liquid as I can be and fluid as I can be and just not to be mentally locked in a box. So again, I think trading has done that for me. It's allowed me to go, hey, don't spin up. What are you seeing? What can you influence here? Where is your direct sphere and what do you need to do in your space? And the rest of it, I'm like, you know, you're just going to see people go guano crazy. Yeah. Yeah. We are.

Not like not even just from a trading perspective, just the world. Yeah, just like. But then kind of drawing that parallel to trading itself, this last year has been fascinating to me. Yes. Because just about everything that, you know, I base my decisions on and whatnot, it's all different this year. Yes, out of window.

Well, I think the biggest thing is that it's the stuff, you know, people are talking about it now, but we started seeing it shift maybe towards June, July. How much the option, how much the option space is actually driving the market versus the market driving the option space. That is the most remarkably different thing that I've seen. It's been a, a very tough year for me because I feel like there are no natural rhythms of ebb and flow that have appeared in times past. Right. And so there's a lot that I've had to change. But you know, adapt or die, right? And so the big things that I've seen, the biggest thing is what options are doing to drive the market because the market maker who is seeing the call options just continually rise in order for his delta not to be savagely negative because he's got the other side of that. He's got to go by the stock. And so that is really driving this motion. You know, every person I talk to in the options pits are like, I've never seen anything like this. You",

You know, they're buying calls in mass, 200 out of the money in, you know, something like Apple or Tesla or whatever, right? It's just extraordinary motion. And here is the biggest thing. When moves get very fast, it's like blowing a bubble very quickly. It will snap without any notion that it's going to snap. If you blow a bubble with the bubble come and you blow it slowly, you can see those edges and you can go, all right, this is. But it's moving so fast that when it comes, I mean, we're going to get up and it's going to be limit down for days. Right. It's just a matter of time. The big thing I just read before I got on this call with you is what's going on with China and the loans and everybody having reading about that. It's a restructure all the loans. And so the only thing that makes a market crash is illiquidity. That's the only thing. And so it's going to come.
