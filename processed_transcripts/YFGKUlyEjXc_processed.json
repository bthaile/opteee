    "text": "I was actually watching CNBC and um there was a woman on there talking about her expectation of call skew which I honestly was expecting to see here but I don't see it as it sits right now right now it looks like the market is still pricing up the downside a little bit more and again this doesn't mean that the market is necessarily expecting downside you generally would expect this see put skew like this and it's because people are buying puts to hedge to the downside people who are selling puts coming into this thing demand a premium to do that now when you see stuff that has really massive call skew on the Tails where the IV is higher than the putside that's generally leading us towards a expectation of a upside move again it doesn't mean that you're going to get it but it means that you're paying a premium to play it to the upside in this case it has a much normal normal relationship let's take a quick look at uh 20 D just kind of the next primary expiration same same and then I just want to take a look at oi for this as well and huge call skue now just to show you what I did I'm looking I looked at the 22 no first the reason why I look at the 22 no first is because the people that are in 22 no are purposefully exposing themselves to earnings",
