    "text": "Number one key to spot a liar is I'm great. I'm the greatest. I'm killing the market. I've killed it every year for a thousand. You're lying. You talk to the greats and they are except for one or two that I know all the one guy who thinks he's great has not made any money kind of great. And he has made a lot of money. But the least vocal about it, people who are arrogant, the market will pound you down. It's going to beat you down and you the market teaches you to be cautious and careful and not arrogant. The market will expose your arrogance.",
