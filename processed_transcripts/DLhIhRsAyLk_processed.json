    "text": "wouldn't surprise me to see people trying to short it here you can already see it's hard to borrow so we'll have to do a little bit of digging to see just what the internals of it look like but I mean another what almost 10 day 8 and 34 so massive massive move here so tons of opportunity literally options changed with 450 IV the only thing I would not is people are coming in here saying like oh I want to sell puts oh I want to sell calls the problem with selling options in something like this is you have to remember if you're selling puts or if you're selling calls those are still directional trades people have gotten way too used to the if IV is high sell if it's low buy there's still a Delta component to these trades so if this thing continues to move crazily it doesn't matter if IV is high it's pinned at 100 guess what it can stay there for a while when IV is that high it means the underlying is moving a lot which is not good for short single options with undefined risk so something to keep in mind as always if there's anything you need let me know be an outliner I'll see you later",
