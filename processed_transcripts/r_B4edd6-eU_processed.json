    "text": "hey everyone eric here wanted to do a quick update on the small stacks portfolio so in short this is relatively going to be a quick video not much going on but i'm doing my best to try to make these videos as i'm making adjustments hopefully at least same day or within a few days so let's jump over the screen and take a quick look so big change from today is essentially i just took down the bac short puts so in there i was short the 24 puts i got a dollar 22 and i closed them today for a nickel um that was more or less a no-brainer i was essentially going to take it to expiration but once i started seeing a couple down moves after its gap up you know just took it down took the profit in and we'll redeploy the capital once i see something um and then if we take a quick look at the diagonals this is also essentially status quo so let's take a quick look at these products just so that you can kind of see an idea of what i'm seeing in bank of america as you could tell we've had this gap up and then um kind of more inside day here starting to come down a little bit here so really what i was just trying to do is ride out as long as i could to collect as much premium out of it as",
