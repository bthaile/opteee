    "text": "What is up outliers? Today, I am just going to recap some of the GameStop live stream that I do Saturdays at 5 p.m. Pacific time because I actually learned some really interesting things. And because it's a short market week, I'm going to do my standard weekly outlook video tomorrow being Monday because that'll be right before the market opens on Tuesday. So today we'll just be about GameStop. And there was a couple of really, really interesting things that I picked up from the live stream yesterday, which I always remind everybody I have a blast doing those because of this because I have the opportunity to learn a little bit, hopefully share a little bit of my experience and information with others to maybe help them with their process. But I love that it's this beneficial back and forth style interaction, which is super fun because I think it's really informative for everybody. So one of the things I did yesterday was I popped onto DFVs, Rorynkitties, page, unread it. And I went all the way down as far as I could go to the origin. And I found something fascinating, something that I didn't expect to see personally. And when I clicked into this, I can see that we started with 113,962 account. And I can see 13,962 is in cash. And then I can see 100,000 is used. Okay, nothing so special about that. This is what I find semi-special. The fact that his entire",

Okay, nothing so special about that. This is what I find semi-special. The fact that his entire portfolio here is in options. I genuinely took the cat to be a stock trader that used options to amplify his position. This tells me otherwise. This is an options trader. Now, again, obviously he trades stock and stuff like that. I'm not saying he's one or the other, most of us are not relegated to being one or the other. But my original perception was that when I went back this far and started looking through these, that I actually would have seen a stock position and then some options amplifying it, not just options. So I found that really, really interesting. And the curious thing is I go through a couple of these different cycles that I can see these different posts. And I pick up another really interesting series of adjustments that go into these positions. So the first thing I want to know is take a look at the fact that we have 1,000 total options in here. And we started with just 50. Then we started with another 50. And notice the time between these trades. So we see from the seventh to the 20th to the 12th to the 18th. So we can see",

So we see from the seventh to the 20th to the 12th to the 18th. So we can see some time passes. We're not scaling in right away. And one of my favorite parts here is we actually get to see a little bit of degenerate behavior. I use that term with all due respect and just love where the dude and what he does. And I also identify as a degenerate. I think that's what most of us are as traders. And I see he starts, you know, with 5 grand, 5 grand, 5 grand, 5 grand. And he, you know, he's buying when it's 60, 75, 55, 50. And then all of a sudden I see a 21 grand block come in. So then he grabs 230. This is the quintessential adding to a losing position, scaling in. Now, again, I say that partially ingest because a lot of the standard methodology you will hear from a lot of traders kind of like the can slim style specifically comes to mind, but others as well. You don't want to add to a losing trades. I myself actually don't fully believe in that. And I think that once you become a slightly more experienced trader, you get to explore these areas of nuance.

So I don't actually view this as just kind of being, you know, like a lost Yolo degenerate trader. I view this as him scaling into a position. And then when it got really cheap, he liked it at 60, he liked it at 75, he loved it at 30. That's what I took from this. Because the other thing I noticed is that he also scaled back in as it was going up. So this is a really interesting behavior to me specifically because he started so light 50, 50, 50, 50, and then he essentially doubles plus for the rest of these transactions, the smallest transaction after that is 100 lots. So that I can't help but find interesting. Now another interesting thing I find about this is that this is clearly centered on a specific strike. So he's scaling into the same position over time. So if we go back to this first, we can see that this position went on pretty early. And if I hover over this, it should tell me when he posted this, the eighth of September 2019, eighth of September in",

He bought leaps that were out in 2021. So he's playing the long game here. The other thing that this tells me is especially when he first started with GameStop is that this isn't as scalpel of an approach as I thought. Because one more analyzing everything that he's doing, it's so easy to fall into this, I don't know, to this mindset where it's like, yeah, this dude essentially is a time traveler. He knows what's going to happen before it happens. He positions in times it perfectly. And as I look through more of this, again, he's an absolute stud. He's crushed it. But it's not perfect.

It was just that my perception after looking through and reading about him, I kind of built him up to be where everything I thought he did was like, perfect.

So this to me represents him trading this broader thesis of him liking GameStop. This is again, to me, not indicative of him attempting to trade these different FDD cycles and stuff like that in the beginning. Because otherwise, I don't see why you would position it quite this way. But I thought that was interesting. Then if we scroll up a bit, we have to go for a while. Because this is still the same position, all options. We have to scroll up more. This is now 29 November. All options still, no change. Then we go into 11 December. All options still with a couple with one additional trade here. So his account value is declined. It's gone from 113 down to 83. And he added another 100. Lots at the same strike. So now he has 1100. So he's kind of moving and even lot increments. Again, this is all part of the fingerprinting process for me. Then this happens. We now go into a bunch of different explorations.

But then we have July in 2020, April in 2020, Feb in 2020, and then April in 2021. So he's maintaining a deep position. He scaled down this front options position. And he spread some of his capital around fascinating. He took this from over 100,000 position to down to 62. And then he started moving that out into other strikes and explorations. Very interesting. And again, this was really surprising to me because this is all the way out now in 31 December 2019. And there's still no shares at all in this picture. It's all options. Find that very interesting. So then we go out a little bit further. We still have all options. And this is now 14 Jan. We go out further. This should be the end of Jan 2020. All options. Then we have end of Feb 2020. All options. His account has contracted meaningfully. He's down to 44 grand from his start. I don't I didn't catch what his peak was. But from his start was over 100. Now we see shares.

So my guess is he deposited a bit of money here. And then obviously made some money potentially off of these options and stuff. But this takes us now to April of 2020 is the first time I see him by shares. So this dude has been trading options really as a leveraged position for some time as he's building out this position in May of 2020. Notice his share equivalent hasn't changed. And he's building out more options. So I thought that was really fascinating. And I learned a lot about the way that he tends to purchase options, what explorations, all of the traits that I've seen him put on as I scroll through this whole saga is not short dated. He's not doing a bunch of stuff that's expiring in like five seconds. Most of the stuff that he's buying are things that are further out in time. And most of them are out of the money. Right. So we can see that in this case, the stock was trading at 401. And we can",

So we can see that in this case, the stock was trading at 401. And we can see that he had the eights, tens, 15s, 20s and 12s across different explorations. These are all further out of the money. So the other thing that I identify as I go through this whole process with him is his preference for strike selection via I'm using it mentally as a surrogate delta. He has a bit of a delta preference. So we can see him now scaling more into shares, more into shares again. And this process continues for him. So I don't know if everybody else knew that. It's probably old news to the vast majority of people out there. But again, I'm new to this. So I'm enjoying learning these different artifacts myself. This isn't something that I've come across a lot of different places. I think one of the reasons why I didn't expect to see this is because when I first started doing the live streams and talking with people like Newton and kind of learning the background, it was explained to me that actually for a long time, Superstunk and like some of these other communities wouldn't even allow the discussion of options, which again, that just led me to believe like, okay, yeah,",

That starts to happen here in July of 2020 as he's moving into more and more of the equity. So really interesting. And I'm really interested to see if we find out soon, hopefully, if he's maintained some sort of game stop position as he's been playing Choui, because as I go through his entire portfolio going back from when he started here, I mean, it's all game stop, right? So I haven't seen him trade other things in here. And I haven't really picked up on this is holiday. I haven't really picked up on that pattern for him. So yeah, I love the way that this dude calls it a straight yellow from the get go. That's essentially exactly what I see here as I watch his account value go from 22 mill to 48 mill to 33 mill.

So then we see the ending account value at like 34.4 mill in 2021, final update. This I find interesting that he called it the final update on 16 April. This is interesting. And I would love to learn a little bit about why this as the final update versus April 17th or the end of April, like why here? I don't know if this had to do with the case and stuff like that that was going on and the fact that he was going to have to appear in front of Congress. I don't know if that happened here or if this happened previous to that. You guys got to help me with that because I know that you know the timeline better than I do. But then he comes back obviously to June. And the dude has gone from 34.4 mill to 210. So quarter of a billion. Absolutely fascinating. Learned a lot.

And I know myself and it's because you know my background with money and like what I'm trying to do is different than what he was trying to do it seems. And that's okay right different people have different objectives. All I'm saying is that because I understand there's a difference in our motivations and the way that we treat risk. This wouldn't work for me. But the overwhelming majority of his success obviously came from his intellect is ability to identify these opportunities.
