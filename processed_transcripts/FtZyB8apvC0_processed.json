It's time to look at some fundamental trading concepts so that we can all dust off our skill sets and hopefully make a few dollars out there in the markets. We'll see how it goes. Who knows? Nobody ever knows. So we have a bit of an open agenda for today, although there's a couple of things that I do want to hit on. The first thing is some just kind of poking through the markets and doing a little bit of a recap from a practitioner standpoint. I think talking a little bit about some observations will likely be useful. I also want to cover poking through Reddit just a little bit and using that as a vector to take a look at what a lot of basic concepts being looked at are and things like that. So we have a bunch of things to talk about. So let's start with recapping the markets. And so for the week, we obviously saw a pretty massive turn underway. We saw tech really starting to accelerate to the downside. We saw bond starting to tick up, like equity. Then we start to see IWM, small caps rotating over, cues rotating over and even the spy now starting to rotate over. So really, this is becoming a generally broad market movement that we're seeing. Obviously, we are at the point now where this clearly is",

So really, this is becoming a generally broad market movement that we're seeing. Obviously, we are at the point now where this clearly is in at least at this point, a correction. If not starting to migrate even towards a bear market, not quite there talking about cues specifically, by the way, IWM still hovering right around a correction and then spy is not quite there yet. Spy is the last bastion of strength that to me is slowly, slowly looking like it is rotating over. So for NASDAQ, I see net highs lows negative with gross lows expanding. And I see net highs lows across the New York stock exchange contracting massively. Yesterday, it was at like 141 net and today it's 47 and gross lows is expanding. So market breath doesn't look great here. So the reason why I'm taking a minute to go over this with you all from again, a market practitioner standpoint is because making observations in the market is part of our job as traders. That's what we do. It's how we identify things that look interesting to us that we want to explore, ideally trade. It's how we make money by identifying things that look good. So understanding the broad market in my perspective is a really, really important part of this process. I actually have, let",

This thing, as I've mentioned a few times is starting to get a little unwieldy, but I'll show you. Let me see. Maybe this one. So this is actually going to come out in a video soon, but this idea of like starting from the top and zooming into the individual products is a really, really useful process. So that's a quick recap of the markets. We'll dive more into it, but as you know, we got to grab the chat and we got to say hello to everybody. We got to see who's hanging out. And I also realize I have to turn the air conditioning on in my well up. It's already on. I have to turn it up in the office because even though your boys in a tank top, it is pretty freaking warm here in Southern California. So what do we got? I see we got threshold solutions.

Vladimir off Putin. They made a way more sense now. Yeah, so I actually think that this idea of a soft landing is starting to look increasingly tenuous. That's my take because the market is very good at forecasting and when we look across even the economic picture from the past week, things aren't necessarily looking great. So if we look at PMI from earlier in the week, manufacturing PMI that came in a little bit light manufacturing prices came in a little bit high. That's not necessarily ideal job opening still came in a little bit light which I don't really know anymore how the market's going to interpret that news. Obviously the market didn't like most of what we saw this week. This is PMI came in a little bit higher which I imagined Boads well and then so like as I look across the broader market from the past week, there is a ton of stuff that happened but there was one thing that remained the same. The market essentially sold off the entire week. Yeah, literally the entire week. Roy Titty says I'm not hating. I know you spend a lot of time on all this. It's just my way brain process.

But if you're an investor and you're really gun shy at entering into the market, sure I could see that. But if you're a trader that's absolutely not how you look at the world, right? Because there's still several months before the end of the year. So the idea of not doing anything into the end of the year because of being gun shy. Yeah, that's a problem. But from a trader's perspective, the last thing I'm doing is loading up on a bunch of long beta weighted deltas to the market, to the broad market and just going to hold them into next year until they start to turn that I think is a bit of a problem, right? Because there's an opportunity cost to that capital and it to me, it's some, well, not a sunk cost. But the opportunity cost there is enough that I wouldn't just park money waiting.

That's completely, completely fine for like a longer term perspective. That's the name of the game of investing is maintaining long term exposure to right out the bumps and whatnot. So Zach Rij has made it in. What up Reese's here as well. Cedar Savage says time to pull out bearish strats for a few weeks. Yes. I actually think Cedar Savage, you're behind the ball, to be honest. I don't think you're wrong, but I think one of the problem is depending on what you're trying to trade. If you're just now starting offering short deltas, it's still not too late, I would argue, but they become higher risk entries. And I've talked about this most of the week. So for example, if I look across something like XLE, I've already had fades in XLE after it started breaking out below this level, I actually added more today. And that's actually one of the things I want to review today is I thought one of the things we could do in the beginning of the video is actually take a look at some sample trades and we can kind of reason through them together. So there's two time frames I want to use. I want to use today. So as if we're trying to find a trade to put into a hypothetical portfolio today,",

So I just want to let half of you know that Vladimir Off-Pooten thinks you ain't shit is essentially what I saw. So yeah, anyways, just wanted to relay that message directly from Vladimir Off-Pooten to the rest of the chat. I'm just the middle man here. I can just see it all.

Now again, the whole point of this segment and just in case you're new to this, what I'm doing is I use Reddit, the option subreddit as a proxy for beginners. I can see and understand how beginners are looking at the market by going to this Reddit. So why we go through this together is to take a look at other beginner concepts theories, things that they're trying to grapple with because this is a series for beginners. So I use it as a proxy.

On average, much more profitable stock trader, profitable trading options, get greedy. Yeah, see, I hate this. I hate this so much. So one of the reasons why I hate this so much is because when I see traders saying things like I get greedy, it tells me a lot about their understanding of their business.

And let's get past the superficial responses of getting greedy is bad and yeah, of course. Okay, so Kevin and Jotato are hitting on one of the things I specifically wanted to specifically want to highlight is no plan. Seater is actually, it looks like we disconnected standby. Are we, am I still here? It says reconnection successful. I have no idea. Am I currently not, not, can you hear this? Okay, good. You guys can hear it. Thanks. OBS just told me it popped off for some reason. I actually have literally no clue. Maybe somebody is doxing me or so. I don't even know what that means. I'm not going to lie. All right, so let's see. The first one is the definitely no plan, right? The prospect of being greedy during an options trader, really any trade, it tells us right from the jump that you're going, you're not following something that makes sense. And I'll show you exactly why that's the case in a few minutes. So no plan is a big part. There's a really, really, really important specific thing though that",

I'm actually a highly discretionary trader. I'm not mechanical. There are absolutely bounds to what I do. But I actually personally believe that a vast majority of the edge for retail traders is discretion. If you're too mechanical as a retail trader, that essentially means whatever you're doing should just be automated. And there's a reason why most of us don't automate everything. And it's because there's not buckets of edge laying around like that, unfortunately. So that's not to suggest you can't automate anything, of course you can. But there is a lot of value in being a good discretionary trader. The reason why the idea of being mechanical as a trader is so well-touted is because it sounds super smart, right? You can't trust the trader. So then just make it a repeatable strategy that you follow these specific rules. And then you take the trader out of the equation essentially. Well, guess who creates the edge in trading? It's the trader. So there's lots of ways to do that. And again, I would never say like, oh, being mechanical is dumb or not.",

So there's lots of ways to do that. And again, I would never say like, oh, being mechanical is dumb or not. Like I would never say anything like that. That's just the reason why I'm discretional in my trading. So just an important note there. So the plan is part of it. And then roaring titty and jote do or on the next part of it. There's I'll get to the part I want to highlight first. And then we'll get into those because for roaring titty, I completely, completely agree. So for roaring titty and jote do not setting a stop can help with this exact thing. So let's talk about that really quick. Let's say that we're trading stock XYZ. This one will talk about a little bit later because I have a position on actually in this to the downside. This was going to be an example of finding short deltas. That's like a current state example. But we'll get to that in a second. Let's take a look at Palantir. They joined the SP 500 today that just jumped in my mind. So let's say we're trading Palantir to the upside. We think it's going to go up sick. Great thesis makes total sense. Let's say that you got in here. And you're like, okay, I'm going",

So if I wanted to overfit my strategy, I would say something like, oh, yeah, I'm going to put a move my stop up to here. But that's unrealistic. The probabilistic scenario here would be this would probably be the last stop that goes in. And then you essentially, I would run it from here. It would start rounding out. And then I would get stopped somewhere out here. So then I do give up some of my profit. But in the process of attempting to let my profit run, I'm following it. So that's a really, really, really simple way to essentially set a trailing stop for your position. But that's not just based on an arbitrary percentage, although there's nothing wrong with those.

So this is really dangerous. It's really dangerous. The reason why it's so dangerous is because we think we're being enlightened. We think that we're being self-critical.

The problem with this is very, very, very likely that there's way more wrong with their approach than being greedy, but they're not looking because they think they're greedy. And that's the problem that they're looking at. So what I'm highlighting here is that when we're analyzing our performance as traders, we have to analyze the total performance and then quantify our guesses, right?

When I look at this, I see somebody that is just filled, filled with disillusion. That's what I see. Because options and trading in general is not for most people. That's all there is to it. For the vast majority of people, they won't make money trading. It's not even trading options. It's trading in general. Options simply amplify what you're doing. So for example, if this person had some sort of approach that, let's say they were just trading to the long side, they were trading up. Their profit mechanism is up. If they were just trading up and they were really good at picking up, even if they used options or stock, they would still make fucking money. They would still make money. So this isn't options as a problem. This is a trader problem. Now the reason why their stock portfolio is doing well is because they're enjoying something called positive drift. The vast majority of the stock market goes up in the long run.

It's not because there's some sort of great stock picker, because if they were some sort of great stock picker, what you're doing in options would work fantastic. So this is a prime time example of two things I want you to take away. The first thing I want you to take away is that this is dangerous. If you think that there are faults in your trading, we all have them. Do not relegate the performance to one single fault. It is highly unlikely to be the case. It's very likely that there are multiple things that lead into the problem set. The second thing is that options amplify whatever you're doing. So if you're trading, you have to start with the profit mechanism first. You'll hear me say that until I fucking die because I think all of us is options traders. We start looking at options and trading options before we even have a profit mechanism that works. Start with the profit mechanism, get something that works.

Then whether you trade stocks, whether you trade options, whatever the fuck you trade, if you can reliably identify a profit mechanism, the rest are just tools that help you take advantage of it. So that is the point here. Evergreen says, is this guy teaching a course to morons? I'm way too advanced and experienced to listen to this. Been trading options for years. Please see something higher level. So evergreens, this is a great example of somebody who thinks that they're further along than they are because for somebody like you, I would highly recommend just like in trading, the Devils and the Details, I would read the name of the stream. Try that out for yourself. So what you'll notice is at the tail end of the title for the stream, it actually says options trading for, there's a very specific term in there. Beginners, that's who this is for. So not morons, that's not it at all. Beginners are people who simply are trying to learn something new. So they're starting point and how much information and background they have and something is going to be naturally lower. So that's why we're talking about these things.

It looks like, I don't know how much of their comments it deletes. Looks like all damn, that's actually kind of harsh. No shit. Huh. I actually didn't know it did that for, for you guys. Can you see next to their name? Because for me, it says message deleted by outlier options trading and then it says view deleted message. So I can still click it and view the message. Huh. Huh. Learn a new shit every day. As I continue to remind everybody on these streams is I don't belong on any of these things. I don't know what I'm doing. I just like trading.

Yeah, damn boy. They had his 19 cents. They ain't fucking about. They're exactly right. So you guys tell me what's the answer to this question. Now let's be let's be let's keep it a buck. The first answer to this question is where the fuck is their battery power? The idea of posting a screenshot with literally 2 battery power is crazy to me. So I think we have to start with that and make sure that middle month 20 97 is doing okay, because for to be in that kind of mental state to have 2 battery power at 12 56 bm is fucking crazy.

I think middle month needs the fucking power bank because this is nuts 12 56 no battery power. There's no outlet near you. This is crazy. All right. Harlow says don't they already factor in the weekend? Roryntitty says no, they don't factor it in. Oh good. So this one needs a poll hold on. We need a poll here since there's a bifurcation. All right, let's see. Theta decay impact. Hold on does theta? No. Does. X, transic. Value decay. Theta. Over the weekend. Yes or no? All right, there's a poll there for your viewing pleasure. I'm actually really curious because the comments obviously show a bit of a split. So far one hundred you say yes. Ah, there is the no. I see all right, we'll leave that open for just a couple seconds. That's a great question. I actually really, really like that. All right, we got 17 votes. That's pretty good. 18, leave it open for another couple more seconds. Go and once. Go in twice. All is ended. We had 72 say yes. And we had 27 say no. The yays",

So to their question of does theta decay on Friday, factor in the weekend already, it's actually a great question. And the answer is partially. So what will happen to them is as Saturday and Sunday pass, they won't lose 18 per day because a lot of this is actually factored into the clothes on Friday. And then there will be an adjustment on Monday. So the thing to know from this specific question that a lot of people don't know is that theta is not linear. It's not one day passes. You lose this exact amount of money. And it's not based on 30 seconds. You lose this portion of that amount of money. It's not linear. So market makers will essentially, Ryan says partially wasn't a poll option. Well, because the poll option is specific, right? Does extrinsic value decay over the weekend? It certainly does. Extrinsic value does decay over the weekend. What I'm highlighting though is that it just doesn't decay linearly. So a lot of the theta decay will",

So a lot of the theta decay will be factored into the clothes on Friday with the residual that comes out Monday. It's just not as discreet as theta in and of itself shows us. Theta is showing us stuff in a vacuum, right? So another great example here is, or do I lose 18 for Saturday and Sunday? So obviously here, they're looking at 18. If I look at their option, which we just shared together, theta is already at 19. So theta moves. Doctors, they said so it decays harder on Fridays and decays over the weekend, but not as hard. Yep, that's exactly the way to think about it. And it's not only on Fridays. So the way that this will work is over the Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, the weekend decay is already being amortized into the options, not just on Friday. It starts earlier. Because if they don't do that, people like me will know like, oh shit, on Friday, they're going to decay out most of the weekend's theta before the weekend. I'm going to trade that. And then I have a great trade because I fade fall on Friday. I gammahed throughout the day. So I've no delta exposure knowing that essentially",

And then at the end of the day, I cover my position. Don't make a ton of money on any one of those, but you can scale that easily. So that's why they start earlier. Because then I'm forced to expose myself to way more market factors as a trader. So it's not as linear as that. Roryntitty says they're going to lose more than 18. They may or may not. We can't tell yet. So again, the fact is, is that it just won't be a linear 18 per day as they're guessing. And again, this is a great question. So the takeaway from this one is that leading into a weekend, typically starting as early as Tuesday, but typically Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, market makers are going to start valuing the options in taking out an additional portion of theta to account for the weekend because a lot of these products don't trade over the weekend. So it accounts for that dead time. Now the trick here is that it still can move over the weekend. That's why it's not fully removed for the weekend because some news can come out about this individual",

So this is a really great question. It's a bit of a technical question, which is why I think it's important for trade creators to know theta is not linear. Not only is it not linear in its overall decay profile, but the way that it's applied over the weekends in a smaller profile is important. So I'll show you this. So this shows you theta decay over different time frames. Right? So you can see is you get close. This is you, oh, shit, I moved it. This is using at the money options. I also realized that I have my old logo and all of these. That's super frustrating. Don't love that for me. And I also realized that this isn't lined up with the other one. That's also annoying. Okay, that's better. All right. So now this is better. Anyways, you can see theta decay in and of itself day over day is not linear.

We use it colloquially different than what it actually is. And again, when we're doing like these beginner sessions, I like to be very, very clear about these concepts just so that you understand. And then if we want to get lazy and use theta to represent time, that's okay, right? That's what most of us mean. But theta actually is time decay. That's what theta, it's a measure of time decay. Theta is a term is not time. We just use it for time colloquially. But theta in a technical sense is a measure of time decay. So the reason why news and stuff like that can indirectly impact theta is because it can impact the extrinsic value of an option by moving the underlying. But to the point of the question, theta in and of itself is not directly impacted by news. It's simply impacted as a result of the underlying moving and then intrinsic and extrinsic values sliding accordingly, yielding a different theta based on that. Let me know if that answers the question. Lauren says, I find that",

It's simply impacted as a result of the underlying moving and then intrinsic and extrinsic values sliding accordingly, yielding a different theta based on that. Let me know if that answers the question. Lauren says, I find that delta and theta really confusing makes me want to eat paste. I have a video for you then hopefully Greeks. I have a video that dives literally into all of the Greeks. It's like not super long. It's like 16 minutes. So this is for that Lauren, that video I just dropped and that video is literally all about the Greeks. I go through first or degree, second or degree, third or degree spend most of the time for first order Greeks because that's what impacts most people. And for those that don't know, the first order Greeks actually includes a second order Greek. We just often refer to it as a first order Greek. It's just kind of like a nerd fact that I don't really get a chance. Like if I tell my wife something like that, she couldn't possibly care less. So I have I'd share it with you guys. So fun fact. I'm essentially an encyclopedia of completely and utterly useless information. It's not necessarily something I'm super proud of, but it is what it is. All right.

All right. So we're through our first spin drift. We're moving over to our reserve watermelon, seltzer water. And we are ready to move on here. So here we go. So this is looking at non-trading periods, right? That's what this study looks at. And it says, we document the striking results that US equity premium over the last decade is solely due to overnight returns. The return during the night are strongly positive and returns during the day or close to zero and sometimes negative. This day and night effect holds for individual stocks, equity indices and futures contracts on equity indices. Night returns are consistently higher than day turns across the week, month and times of year. So this essentially is highlighting a really important function of markets that a lot of people don't know exists, which actually really surprises me to be honest, because it's nothing that's like revolutionary or complex, at least in my opinion, but you'll see this essentially everywhere. So I ran a study actually for the pro members, the Patreon members for the Outlier community. And I was essentially walking them through movements and SPX and how it breaks out throughout the day. So what I do is I like to look at products like this that I trade variance risk premiums in.",

So that I can see where the bulk of movement occurs. And in something like SPX, you'll notice if we look over any sort of significant time frame, a lot of the movements that you'll find happen within the first and last 15 minutes. Of course, this isn't always right. So this is a big move that's like an hour into the market. So it's not always 15 minutes. But very frequently, the first 15 minutes and last 15 minutes of the market will be very busy. That's where we see overnight orders flooding in that we're resting. And then that's where we see everybody positioning for the next day. So you'll see a lot of active style traders like myself will favor the last hour of the day heavily and the beginning part of the day to be clear for like opening range breakouts and stuff like that. The big movement from overnight tends to come from pension funds and like these really big institutions that are just resting orders overnight to get hit on the next open.

So you'll you'll find this trend holds over time with the vast majority of products. So that's essentially part of what this is identifying for you. Let me see Zacharias says, is it distracting to ask about holidays? Same right? No, it's not distracting at all. Dude, this is a completely open conversation. We talk about straight up whatever you guys want to dive into. Zacharias says holiday is same, right? Yeah, exactly. So if we have an extended duration, technically speaking, there's even greater opportunity to capture various risk premiums from there because the market has to account for that additional time off. And again, non trading periods tend to be really efficacious for stuff like that. The risk you run is if there's really terrible news that comes out, a war breaks out or whatever, and you get this massive gap on the open. But again, like for the way that I trade, I'll use SPX and then I can always hedge with the futures if something really terrible happens. Effectively creating a spread. So Zacharias, a fantastic question. Nothing wrong with that question at all. And it's completely the same. It changes the way that they essentially have to amortize theta. Great question.",

The fact that I know that is also not great. Okay. So French 1980 observed another calendar anomaly. We noted that the average return to the SP composite portfolio is reliably negative over the weekends in the period of 53 to 77. The dependent variable is daily return to abroad portfolio stocks, short, portfolio based on Dow Jones. So they're talking about essentially the drift over the weekends. And you can see the way that they estimate it. I don't know if they talk about volatility in here. They might not. I don't think they talk about volatility in here. My bad. That Lauren says I'm glad someone reads it for when we have questions. Yeah. And I get it. Like that's why I try to summarize a lot of these studies for you.

Vladimir says many individual stocks react to news and the SEC filings and almost all of this is as close and extended hours when I'm just trading is not possible. Yep, that's correct. That's absolutely correct. That's why that that's why that there's still extrinsic value assigned to non market or to non trading periods. My wife is texting me asking about dinner. So we got to see what we're going to order. I'm thinking, what do you guys think barbecue? The barbecue man. barbecue sounds good. All right. So that's these. I think we can kill these. You have those. Let's take a look at this one. So we killed this. Here we go. Option volatility and pricing for the average Joe. I love options. I really want to learn options. And I've already got a few books on trading and essentials like options as a strategic investment. Shout out to you acceptable answer. That's that's an acceptable answer. But option volatility and pricing. This one scares me as a simple man. Followed three longshore men background as a carpenter. Am I entering a world of paint? No, you're not.

As you look at this top box, would you think to click this or do you need this one here? Addic curiosity from a user's perspective. Vladimir says Chinese food is always great and keeps your body MSG levels. I actually don't disagree. Or Indian maybe. I'm kind of down for whatever. All right, dust the dust says top link. That Lawrence says bottom. Yeah, okay. So my instincts are correct to have both. Because I just I just expected people to naturally gravitate to either the titles in clicking or these, which is why I include both, right? You can't think they're both right. So anyways, on this, if you go down to the bottom, you can take a look at options 101.

This is actually hilarious. All right, we're doing Indian. She doesn't want Mexican either. I feel like Indian is a good choice. I have no regrets with some solid Indian. Dustin does says Eric, that's the second book. You 100 recommend what's the first options as a strategic investment that I think is probably the easiest book for most people to pick up and start learning about options. It's not quite as technical as what you will find from option pricing and volatility, but it is a little, I don't want to say it's a little heavy.

Yes, I think it's required. No options trading is not easy. No, it's absolutely not for everybody. That's kind of, that's just kind of how it goes. So when I think about what I think works best with learning to trade options, it's a mix of fundamental understanding of theoretical concepts. And then it's starting as fast as you can on the more complex components. So things like how to take the theoretical components and then use them live. That's really not easy. And I think a lot of people struggle pretty hard with that exact process. But to me, that's kind of really where that entire process comes together because you can be super, super, super, theoretically sound, like completely theoretically sound. And then you cannot understand at all how to actually trade. So to me, you kind of have to have a really strict balance of both. That's my overall thought. Vladimir Alpoutin says, I've tried paper money, but feel that I'm reckless there. To me, that highlights a massive discipline issue that is showing you upfront a problem that is there. There's a massive problem with that. If you are that kind of person and you're not alone, lots and lots of people are like that. But if you are that kind",

If you are that kind of person and you're not alone, lots and lots of people are like that.

Like that, that problem is going to show up in another way if you don't take care of that problem. So paper trading again is giving you a fantastic preemptive heads up that you have a problem of some sort. And again, I'm not saying that you have to, you know, fully treat paper trading as if this is, you know, your livelihood and stuff like that. But if you can't take paper trading seriously, then the probability of you like being able to take trading as seriously as you likely need to is actually pretty low in my opinion. So that's at least the way I look at it personally. I hope it's not the case, right? Like I'm not, I'm not saying that to like wish it on anybody, but I think that that is my general instinct towards that kind of thing in the beginning because you'll find people will say that all the time.

I completely agree. So let's talk about that. Let's talk about that exact thing. Again, I have a video that's coming out next weekend on paper trading. So you guys talk to me. What are some of the ways then if at least I think paper trading is important? It doesn't mean that it, you know, is super important. But if I think it's important, what are some of the reasons why you might think that I think it's important specifically in terms of how can you adopt it if you identify with yourself as I have a discipline problem? I'm not doing a good job treating this as real money. How can we fix that? Any ideas? That Lauren says I started with paper trades and small stocks so it didn't hurt so badly.

That's okay. Change the money to percentages. That's kind of for sizing, which those are good ideas for sizing. So here's what I would tell you. If you're the kind of person that's coming into paper, like I give this example all the time, I'll tell you right now, I'll look at my log right now. I have to go to my data tab. Okay. How many paper trades do you think I have on right now? I am a full-time trader. I've been trading for almost 17 years now. How many paper trades do I have on right now? Vladimir says I've made hundreds of thousands on individual stock trades, but the clock ticking with options is a big difference. It is, but it's not.

So I'm essentially testing an alternate portfolio that has a completely different disposition of what I have. I use things like the core allocation and the speculative trades in that portfolio to essentially show me other elements that might be contrary to what I think. So for example, right now I'm still long deltas and I have a lot of short deltas over laid. However, when I look at the portfolio itself net net, there's still some long deltas. So in my second kind of segment, I'm looking at an alternate portfolio that's primarily short deltas right now and has a little bit of long deltas, kind of the inverse of what I'm doing. And then the third one is variations of literally all of the strategies that I run regularly. That's it. So by doing this, I'm able to test live information because as you all know, I like to look at data. I'll back test, I'll forward test. But even in the process of back testing, I know and can recognize that even subconsciously, there is back end processing that's happening that's tainting the results of what I'm doing that I don't want",

    "text": "you all know, I like to look at data. I'll back test, I'll forward test. But even in the process of back testing, I know and can recognize that even subconsciously, there is back end processing that's happening that's tainting the results of what I'm doing that I don't want to happen. So one of the ways that I combat that is by having all of these different paper trades on at a given point in time to allow me to collect raw data based on what I don't know is going to happen. I have no idea what's going to happen over the next week. So that's why I do it. So the way that I would encourage a newer trader to take paper trading seriously is I would I would do something like this. I would show them this. And then I would say, let's say you're starting at 5,000, let's say that you're able to save on average 1,500. Let's say you're going to look over 20 years and let's say that we're starting with the 10 return. Well, what would I get if I have an 11 return? Well, in that same time frame at an 11 return over this 20 year time frame, I go from 1.06 million to 1.2 million. So it's 200,000. That doesn't sound like super life changing or crazy. But then let's fast forward this out to 30 years. Now what is this turn into? 1 variance between this 10 and",

Now what is this turn into? 1 variance between this 10 and this 11 1 variance takes me from 3 million to 3.7 million. 700,000 over the same time frame for one fucking percent difference. I care about that 1. I care about that 1. So this isn't like some magical big return. This is literally the difference between 10 and 11. But that 1 over a long enough time frame is massively impactful. Now this becomes even more important. Let's say that you have a really good return. Let's say that you return on average 22. Let's take a look at what 22 versus 23 is. You go from 33.7 million, 33.8 million to 41 million dollars. That's from 22 to 23. I care about the one fucking percent. In this example over a 30 year time frame, it's almost 10 million dollars. I care about that. I absolutely care about that. So for me, paper trading is a way to accomplish two things. There are two primary purposes of paper trading. The first one is for new traders to avoid this. If you're a new trader and let's say that you have a 40 drawdown on your account, after that 40 drawdown, you now require a 66.7 recovery in order",

If you're a new trader and let's say that you have a 40 drawdown on your account, after that 40 drawdown, you now require a 66.7 recovery in order to get back to break even. You need a massive, massive recovery in order to get back to break even. So when you're a new trader in my opinion, the game is not trying to turn a small account into a big account. As annoying as that sounds, it's simply so unlikely to be the case that we're going to take a really small amount of money and turn it into a massive sum of money. Not impossible, but it's insanely improbable. So in the beginning, the point of trading is to not lose a bunch of money and then start having to run uphill. That's the point. It's to learn the skill set without burning a shit ton of money learning it. Paper trading helps you with that exact thing. So for the beginner paper traders, I would literally frame it as I am building the exact skill set that I'm going to use and rely on for myself to hit my financial goals. That's the point of paper trading. So if you look at paper trading and you can't take it seriously, you literally can't take your fucking future seriously. You don't care that much.

Now I'm not saying everybody has to paper trade ad nauseam. I'm just saying that if you find yourself in the bucket that you just can't take it seriously at all, that tells me that there's a psychology problem factored into this thing. So that's what I would tell to the new paper trader. Now for the non-new paper trader, experienced traders like myself, I use it for data. I use it for data collection. So for me, the new paper trader, the entire goal for a brand new paper trader is essentially to trade that paper trading account as close as humanly possible to how you think you're going to trade your real money. That's the goal. And then for experienced traders, your goal is to see how can you learn and enhance your strategies to get that 1 that I just showed you is so important. That's the goal for experienced traders. So that's what I think. If you are a paper trader and you're struggling to take it seriously, I would just take a little time, zoom out and think about what you're trying to accomplish and what paper trading allows you to do.",

And I sort of get it. It's boring if you don't think about it in that context. But it's like the same thing. I tell people about like military training. If the only way that I was able to train in the military is by essentially going only to combat and that's the only time I can learn, there's going to be a lot of dead motherfuckers if that's the only way I can learn. So that's my thought, a little bit of a long soliloquy about things. But the reason why I think it's important to like really dive into that is because I think taking it seriously literally can be life changing.

I'm hopeful that that even like generally makes sense to us. Because that's why again, like that's why I bring it up is because I think that it's at least a usable, a usable data point in two different ways. Whether you're a new trader trying not to lose money but learn the skill set or if you're an experienced trader that's trying to make a lot of money. Dust to dust says make it more interesting. Put 10 of your paper trading profits into your cash account. I love that. I think that's a good idea. Vladimir Putin says, are you more aggressive when playing cod than in real life? Same to me when paper trading. Yeah, but again, you can't compare those because if I'm training in real life for what I do in real life, I take that deadly serious. If I'm playing a video game where it's very purpose is for entertainment. That's the only reason why we play Call of Duty or any of these other games is for entertainment.

I would actually equate it far more to real life training for whatever it is that you're going to be doing, whether it's going to combat or whatever it is. Just a more real life practical application, I think is the broader point. That's my opinion. Zacharias says, trade, trade, train hard, play easy. Yeah, well, and that's actually another funny thing that I'll remind traders of all the time is that the actual process of trading is about as easy as it gets for me. And that's not hyperbole. It's really not. Trading in and of itself is easy for me. And the reason why it's easy is because everything else that I do to lead up to whatever it is that I'm trying to build the skill set up.

And the reason why it's easy is because everything else that I do to lead up to whatever it is that I'm trying to build the skill set up. So in this case, trading, I do all of the work ahead of time, all of the work ahead of time. So then in this case, it's just another day of doing what I know I need to do inherently. So all of the work for me in trading is done ahead of time and trading in and of itself does not need to be a difficult process in my opinion. But all of the work to make it not a difficult process has to be done before you start trading. Paper trading helps a lot with that. Reece says, is SP inclusion a tradable event? Yeah, definitely. Sorry, I didn't realize that you had asked that before. That's my bad. So yeah, Reece. So things moving within the SP 500 is absolutely a tradable event. They tend to exhibit drift over a set follow on period. And you can actually look at the, there's a study on it. Let me see if I can find it really quick. That's from a market in efficiency book.

So this isn't the study I was looking for. But this is, let me see. I think this is the one I was thinking of. Yeah, this is the one. So there's two studies that I believe you can reference. The first study here is talking about, again, like the actual reference effect. And then this study essentially is just summarizing it. Let me know if that makes sense. So this one, if we take a look together, you'll see a few things. I think that kind of point out to me. The main thing is that things being added to the SP 500 typically see some sort of movement, post being added. So you can see increases in the share values. But you'll see that the data itself is slightly mixed. And that's why I think this study is a good one to read. So we can go down, we can just read the conclusion together really quick.

I'm not trying to trade the permanent effect of something. I'm simply trying to trade the effect. So the fact that it's not permanent, I don't care literally at all about what I care about is, is it something that's tradable, which it absolutely is in the short term? So I think as long as you have a logical approach in terms of when you put the positions on them for what duration, I think it makes a ton of sense. Vladimir Putin says again, add it to SP 500 after hours when options were not traded. That doesn't matter. It's not an overnight effect. It's not something that's going to come and go today. It's more of a momentum effect. It takes time for it to be priced in. So yeah, it doesn't matter that options weren't trading tonight or on the, on Poundseer. It'll be completely fine.

Before earnings, let's find something that has earnings. Let's do a PLD somebody threw that in the chat before. So we'll take a look at that. So a PLD had earnings leading into earnings. We don't know what's going on. We do know that there's going to be new information critical to the valuation of a stock. We know that that is going to come out with certainty that's going to be here. So that leads to a heightened expectation of implied movement. We know information is coming out that can move the stock. That then means we expect movement of some sort. So leading into earnings, the expectation for implied movement is relatively high. Because we're getting information that can move the stock. Once that information is released, it is then priced into the stock. That's why if you go through something like this, you'll see the orange line is implied volatility. Notice how the orange line is downward sloping, typically through earnings, not always, but typically through earnings will be downward sloping. So that simply means that the implied move based on the information is factored in. And now we're not expecting as much movement. Now the second question that they had that was a great follow up question is, is it a guarantee for stock options to have a crush on earnings?",

    "text": "that simply means that the implied move based on the information is factored in. And now we're not expecting as much movement. Now the second question that they had that was a great follow up question is, is it a guarantee for stock options to have a crush on earnings? What do you guys think about that? Is it a guarantee? It's another fantastic question. You tell me. Dr. Zayz says, crush happens when the unknown becomes known. That's good. Willie says depends on the news. Willie is correct. So Willie. G36 says IV will still decrease, but if the move is larger than the Delta can make up for it, that's incorrect. G36. Elon's song says no guarantee. So Elon's songs also gets one. He says yes, that will decrease, but Delta can easily overwhelm that not necessarily. Tommy also got it right. Dr. Zayz also got it right. So two, three, four trophies. Plus fake one internet point to those four. Now this is one of those things that again, the devil is in the details. Is it guaranteed? No. Is it probable? Yes. The vast majority of instances you will see implied volatility contract through earnings. In this instance, after earnings, it went up. This is the day before earnings. This is the day following the release. So in this case, it went up. It seldom the case, but the reason it can go up is if there's a terrible or a big piece of information that",

That's exactly why you'll see it go up again, sometimes. The overwhelming trend, however, is that it typically will go down. The overwhelming trend, but not always into this person's question, certainly not guaranteed. When does it happen? Another great technical question. So when we get this earnings crush, temporally, when does it happen? Busy blends says, I mean, 90 of the time, Ivy does pump when earnings is near. That's also correct. I wouldn't say 90 of the time because I don't know if that's accurate and I don't like giving bad data points like that, but I can tell you over 50 of the time, aka the majority, Ivy will expand starting two weeks out leading into earnings. So nothing wrong with that. But you guys tell me, when does it happen? So we know that Ivy tends to decline, okay, but when does it, when does it typically happen? Anybody have any ideas?

So Tommy and Reese, you guys get close fake one at an point. I gotta get my little trophy out. There we go. Reese took the under the null hypothesis says before earnings, which is incorrect as well. Zacharias says right before the call from what I see that's also not the case. Tommy says can I convert my points to Bitcoin? Potentially. Yeah, you'll have to see how you redeem them, but yeah, I think you're more than welcome to convert to any of your preferred denominations. So the period in time in which it actually moves is not going to be immediate. The period in time for the Ivy Crush, I don't like calling it Ivy Crush to be honest just because it's kind of like a beaten down phrase. I don't really like it.

And then there might be some sort of persistent drift that occurs. But the movement that I personally would attribute to the earnings release in and of itself would be probably a few hours after the open. So that's another great question from them.

So the problem with this is that again, like what most traders do intend to do. They're simply focusing on the profit. How much money do I stand to make? That's what they care about. I had an MRI earlier today for the whole back bowl shit that I have going on and I had the contrast injected, which apparently has like fucking metal in it. So you're always trying to flush the metal out of the old system. All right, back to you guys. So yeah, G36 definitely gets a point here at G 36. There you go. G36 says I said that only given it away all upside potentially. Yeah. So the main thing here is the downside risk. That's just to be abundantly clear. That's precisely what they missed in this. That's actually like really, really dangerous to them if we're being honest because it shows like an entirely skewed perception of risk. So now for everybody else, how can we fix their perceived risk? There's an easy way to fix this problem. How do we do that? Ratio diagonal. That's a massively effective way to do it. There's another way that's more similar to what they have. I would use a ratio diagonal simply because I would benefit for I would prefer the leverage than holding the shares easy.

Hold that over the shares and you gain way more leverage. I absolutely would take that. But that's not actually what I'm thinking in this case. Reese says I can see if they already hold that stock and have downside risk already. Yeah, it's whether they hold the stock where they're putting on the stock for the race or for the covered call. It doesn't matter. If you hold stock, there's downside risk. People forget that literally all the time for some reason, but that's the risk of holding the stock. Now the funny part about covered calls is that Reese says in their mind, they may already have it. So the downside risk is already prevalent. Right, it doesn't matter, right? Like whether in their mind it's there and exists or not, it doesn't the point I'm highlighting is that it's there. Regardless of how they're trying to rationalize the downside risk or lack thereof, it's there. That's the primary risk in this trade.

That's the exact problem with this kind of thing. Is that traders think that exact kind of way? They think, oh, well, I hold the stock. I'm okay holding it. And even if they're okay holding it, guess what? If Coca-Cola drops, let's take a look at an example. We got in at 68. Let's pretend Coca-Cola, instead of being right now at 71. Let's just not even, I'm not even going to pick a crazy thing. I'm going to pick something that's happened recently. It's go over the past year. It was down to 51.

This is a bit of an old video, so you'll have to forgive essentially everything about it. There you go. So that one talks about the wheel versus the coverage triangle. And there's a reason why I prefer the coverage triangle writ large. The punchline is I have absolutely no problem with the wheel, especially for newer traders. I actually think it's a bit of a safer quote unquote strategy, but I much prefer the coverage triangle or ratio covered calls. Because again, going off of a definition, this is the wheel essentially. I'm going to sell cash secured puts until I'm assigned. The problem with doing that is let's say that you're selling, let's say you like Coca-Cola and you want to trade it to the upside. You're like, okay, I'm going to sell these cash secured puts until I'm assigned. Okay, well guess what? You never got assigned because it just went up from here. So what's the problem with that? Sure, you absolutely would have made money. But guess what you would have made far more money with. Buy in the fucking stock. So the big problem I see exactly, G36 is right on it. I think the problem for people that trade the wheel is they get addicted to a really high win",

I think the problem for people that trade the wheel is they get addicted to a really high win rate. They love the sensation of selling puts, they expire worthless, they love that feeling. Who doesn't? The idea of being right on a bunch of trades is awesome. There's a problem. Just again, in objective analysis standpoint, you would have made more money doing something else. But we're too wrapped up in this great sensation of winning and feeling like we're doing this really smart thing and winning a bunch of trades that we don't really acknowledge that. So I have no fundamental issue with the wheel. If it were me, I would essentially always, always, always sell the calls at a ratio. And I would always sell additional cash secure puts like if I were going to trade it, which essentially turns it into the coverage strangle, which is why I like that strategy a lot personally. Reese says also in the wheel, most people don't admit defeat and think rolling isn't losing. Yeah, oh, yeah, that's a disease. I literally showed you a post. I'll find it really quick.

And then they actually responded and then ended up taking it down. But this like, it's just wrong. It doesn't matter if you roll for a creditor debit like this is what a role entails. We're closing a trade and realizing the P and L on that trade, whatever the P and L of that trade is.

Well, fun fact, you can even roll for a debit and still make money. So even that's wrong. I'll literally show you an example.

So for example, if I sell a call, I get this 153, your net liquidating value does not go up by 153 because it's tied to an open trade. Net liquidating values, if you closed everything right now, what can you take out of the account? So it doesn't go into net lick. It goes into cash and sweep and it sits in cash and sweep. So then in this case, we, in this scenario, we bought back that option for 3.45. So that means that we just realized a 345 loss on this trade, the net PNL between these two trades is essentially these two numbers combined. What's this? Plus this. You lost 192. That's the net. So that's essentially what this shows you here. So that's what you walk out at. After these two positions, you collected 153 at the end of it, you had to give 345. So you had that 153.

You just gave that back and then you had to give 192 on top of that out of your own pocket to close the position. That's the first part of a role right there. And then the second part of the role is when we open a new trade. So in this case, the scenario we use is we sold it for 3.50. So that means we got 3.50 times 1350. So now if you take a look at all of these individual positions, you can see, so equals this plus this plus this 158 bucks. That's how much you're up if this came comes down for 0. That's what that means. Now I use a formula as you can tell here called the premium target and it tells me what do I need to close this option at in order for me to hit break even. So in this case, if I sold this option for 350, I needed to be trading at 158 to be at break even for the position. So if I hit 158, I'm flat. Now this idea of having to roll for a credit, it's wrong. You don't have to roll for a credit. So let's look at another scenario. I sold for 1.53. I closed it for 3.45. Let's say I open the next one for",

So I can have a trade that I roll that I realize a loss that I open up a new trade literally for a debit and I can still make money. I can break all the rules here according to a lot of these people. So this in and of itself is what rolling is. It's two trades tied together. That's all there is to it. Simple as that.

Wait, when you say gaps, do you mean the spread with or do you mean gap in terms of price movement with the underlying? I don't fully follow that question. Vladimir Offputin says, how many years trading options until your aha moment or was it gradual? Super gradual for me. I still don't feel like there's an aha moment where it feels like you just get everything. I think it's something that you slowly pick up over time. Chris says like a 12 and 15 spread, for example. Okay. So, Chris, when you're referring to gaps, most people, when we hear gap, we're going to think a gap in stock price like this. So, yeah, so Chris, in that sense, we would say a 3 wide, that's how we would phrase that. We wouldn't call it a gap. We would say 3 wide or the spread is a 5 spread. Those are two ways. So, again, it's for beginners, right? So, helping you understand some of the lingo. So for those, it's actually, I don't really trade spreads like that.

And then Vlad Amiro Putin says, how to protect against overnight gaps down. Let's say you hold long calls and bad news is released after hours. Your primary tool is sizing. Size the trade. RTity says, okay, credit spreads. Oh, I don't think so. I think you might be talking about a box spread maybe, RTity, because a box spread does that for you. A credit spread is a directional trade. So a credit spread, whether like if it's a put credit spread, it's essentially a bullish trade. And then if it's a call credit spread, it's essentially a bearish trade. But it's not really a place to like park your money. The trade definitely still has risk. So like for example, if we take a look at this 5 wide credit spread in Coca-Cola, just because we're here.",

    "text": "then if it's a call credit spread, it's essentially a bearish trade. But it's not really a place to like park your money. The trade definitely still has risk. So like for example, if we take a look at this 5 wide credit spread in Coca-Cola, just because we're here. It's 5 wide. You collect 87 and you're risking 413. So yeah. And then Vlad Amiro just so you know my response to that really wasn't dismissive. That's the God on a truth in my opinion is to size the portfolio correctly and maintain a diversified portfolio. So if you have 100 of your entire portfolio in an individual stock and you're trading long calls, that's one of the risks you expose yourself to is essentially idiosyncratic risk, something that's very unique to that individual product. So I think sizing is probably the best possible thing you could do after sizing. It's holding a diversified portfolio of different products. Reese says need to collect about a third of the width of the spread to have positive expectancy. It's completely dependent on the probabilities. So it's not quite as neat as a third. For like a 30 delta, it's pretty close. I'm trying to see where I have that spread. Yeah, this one we talked about this one. Oh, we I don't know if we did this with just the Patreon folks. I don't remember when we did this one, but we talked about the spread. So this is essentially like",

This one I copied over for my excel sheet, but so like all this is broken, but this is essentially the way that I look at it. If I'm looking at a spread and I want to see if it's positively expected from the sizing. So it's just based on essentially the different probability of profit, the width and then the credit received. Reese says we did an example on the dollar wide of his 30 cents. Yeah, so it was 30 cents with a 70 probability of profit. So we need to also include the probability of profit. Yeah, it's a really important portion of the input because if you have something that is a massively high probability of profit, then you can you can collect a lower credit, but that's the problem with credit spreads is they don't tend to offer that exposure. I'm loving the questions. I think our dinner just got here, but I still got a few minutes. So Ricky says, what if I love winning more than I love making higher profits? Yeah, then you can do that.

Chris says, what's your preference on time spreads, sell shorter DTE by longer? It depends on what I'm trying to trade. See, this is one of the common thing traders do, right? Because we try to create rule sets about strategies and it's not the way that I look at trading literally at all. So if I take a look at, I think I have it in here. Let me see if I can find it.

So you'll notice that if I'm trying to build a strategy, I need to think about profit mechanisms first, then I need to figure out how I measure them. And then I can start talking about structures and strategy. So in your example, the way that I would determine if what DTEs I want and how I'm going to structure the entire trade is entirely dependent on the profit mechanism. I'm not going to come into a position with the idea of like, oh, I'm just going to trade a time spread here because that's what I want that it doesn't mean anything. I need to make money. So in order to trade something like that, I would have to start with whatever the profit mechanism is. So the profit mechanism sometimes for things like time spreads is potentially playing the relative value between options. Chris says that's what I was hoping you would talk about the thought process. Yeah, sure. Happy to. You know I'm happy to. So this is less about time spreads though. And this is more about options trading. So if I take a look, we'll try Coca-Cola because it's up by volatility.

I see that the 20 set. It has higher vol than the 13 set. So I could make the relative value play that the 13 set, 61s need to become more expensive relative to the 20 set. So in that scenario, I would find this exact strike in this case, the 61s. And then I would buy and sell. So these are obviously super, super far out of the money on the put side. But again, this is just a general example. So I think these need to get more expensive, right? That's the theory is that the 13 sets need to come up and the 20 sets need to come down. So then I'll go to the 20 set, 61s, whatever this ends up being again. I don't actually know what those would be. I would do something like that.

But again, the important part is defining the profit mechanism first. How does this thing make money? And then I can start thinking about other considerations like in this case, how did I pick the DTE? Well, because I looked for the explorations that had something that looked interesting. I could look for ones where there's even greater inversions or I can look for things that are in a specific direction that I want. So all of that will help me identify if I want the call side, the put side. If I want near term DTE, long term DTE, that's all dependent on the profit mechanism. Roaring Titty says, I don't think past all the prerequisites to be trading options. Don't worry, Roaring Titty. I literally think that's the same case for essentially all of us that have ever traded options. So to me, I actually think that makes you even more the option trader. Well, what I would show you is back to this little guide thing that I keep highlighting because I think it's useful.

Here I give you specific learning objectives for each of these steps that I think makes sense. And then actually, if you go to the next page, you'll see that each of these, I show you like sub topics that belong to each of these that you should have a working understanding of. So eventually, I want to build some sort of quiz or test that's built into this. I haven't figured out exactly how I want to do it. I might have to do it through like a Google sheet that then sends the answers or something afterwards. I haven't worked out the details there. That's one of those things that's like on Erics to do list, but it's super low if I'm being honest with you. But I do want to build something like that. But yeah, I think it's okay to start without a full understanding, but I do think it's important to make sure that you understand what you're doing. This is actually one of the things that we offer in the Discord, even the free side, not the pay side. In the free side, you can go through these modules and you can ask people in the beginner section questions, right? Like, hey, I just finished the module two on the types of securities.",

But yeah, I think this would add a lot of structure. That's the whole idea behind it. Chris says, HBIV or Greeks in thoughts at all. Yeah, I mean, they're all super important. I shared a video earlier about the Greeks. I actually have a video. I don't know. You probably haven't seen it. Let me grab this playlist for you. My guess is this playlist would be really useful for you. This is going to be in options 101 playlist. And I have like an options 101 video that's kind of old in there, but I still think it's good.

So I would argue that you might not know them, maybe as well as you think for that reason. But let's see. Like when you are doing you buy cell, that confuses me. Sorry. So time decay, gamma changing delta. Yep. Okay. So in the meantime, I'm going to look at all these different logos on here, because like this guy's funny, maybe I can start using him. If I'm mad. Like IV crushing. Yeah. I'm sorry, I'm not following your question, because like in this example for the horizontal spread, that's that's exactly I'm looking at I'm playing the volatility here.

Chris says theta crush could be wasting your time on the shorter. It could be. Yeah, there's no free lunch, right? That's exactly to your point. That's the point of the Greeks is because it tells us what needs to happen in order for our idea to play out. Chris says, for example, you want the IV crush for the shorter. Well, okay. So just to nitpick terminology a little bit, I think what you're trying to say here is that you're trying to structure a trade where the shorter term option will you think that's where the IV contraction is going to occur. Because I would just always remind like the market doesn't give a fuck what you want or what anybody else wants. It doesn't matter what we want. So I'm just drawing that distinction because I would be really careful even using the terminology of like want in that instance. Chris says so and so that's the goal for the shorter one.

So there's a point where in this slope of learning phase, you know a lot more than you probably think you know, but you also know there's a lot you don't know. But there's a point that eventually comes where you do hit mastery and like you know what you're doing, right?

I also know a lot of fucking shit and I know I know a lot of fucking shit. That's not because I'm cocky.

So 10,000 hours, if you do something five hours every single day, Monday through Friday, Christmas, New Year's, no hungover, drunk phase, none of that. If you do that for, it takes five and a half years to hit this. That's at five hours every single day.

So it's not just the idea of like how to functionally read an options chain. That's obviously part of it. But the bigger part of it is using it to try and make money by using it for some of its predictive qualities. Now the problem with that kind of thing is a lot of people don't realize that things are relative and you have to develop a bit of a fingerprint for whatever it is that you're looking at. So for example, if we're looking at something like GameStop, I can tell you based on the near term performance that today there was some really interesting price movement. I can see lots of options moving in big blocks, but then when I look in time and sales, I can see some really big trades that came through today at different points in time.

    "text": "options moving in big blocks, but then when I look in time and sales, I can see some really big trades that came through today at different points in time. So there's a lot of different ways that you can use options. You can use volatility in something like this to see like where the market thinks things are going. So in this case, I can see there's 174 fall for next week and then the week after that's 149. And then like the week before that, this was like 100 and something earlier. So why is that? It's because something's going on here. Obviously now we know it's earnings. But if you look at some of my older videos where we didn't know earnings had shifted out, I had been pointing out this expiration cycle for a while because I could see it. It was telling me something and my best guess and I called it out in a video that I thought earnings was probably going to shift because of the way that the market was pricing. So yeah, options markets are crazy, crazy informed places. You can look for all different kinds of skew. You can look for unusual trades. I have all sorts of scanners that are running all the time to help me identify interesting opportunities because of those reasons. All right, gang, it is time for me to go eat my Indian food. Absolute blast hanging out. I love the beginner session. It's so",

I am probably going to do a little bit of a workshop in the discord tomorrow. I haven't figured out a time before the game stop live stream, but there's going to be a game stop live stream tomorrow at 5 p.m. Pacific time. We have a lot to talk about on this one. And as always, hit me up with anything you want me to cover any suggestions, any questions here to help be an outlier enjoy your weekends. Not too much. Get some work done. I'll see you all later.",
