    "text": "out the probability of touching the 24s by 31 August and you can see actually from the options chain it mirrors more similarly to what I had in there so these are a 22 Delta two times that would be a 44 probability of a touch but it's actually 63.4 so you notice these are close enough right this is based on when I took it a little earlier today so now we can calculate what what the expected return is on this opportunity so the expected return is 45.99 so why is it why is this positive why do we have an R multiple of 1.29 well because even though the probabilities are pretty close they're very similar to one another this you have the probability of making more money than you're going to lose so even though this might be a lower probability trade it still can yield a little bit more of a profit potential so we need to continue through our example so there I attach to you the expected return here I attach to you the r multiple this is the exact process you can take to evaluate an individual trade this is an individual trade as I outlined before it is important to do this for an entire system of Trades so for example that's when you build your process when you're buying options and you say okay well I'm not going to do 31 days to expiration because they theya de case too",
