The whole idea is to walk through what's going on in these scenarios because they all have elements in common. So this person's asking what I don't understand is why I am still down considerably, even though this stock nearly recovered. This person says if I leave the option as is will it mean that it will expire worthless and I don't have to pay anything? This person saying I need help with an exit strategy on my 20 contracts of GME. And then this person is waiting for the dip to then buy more for this hype. Here's what's going on. These are all people that are not carefully thinking through what they're doing ahead of time. And as annoying and as boring as that sounds, that's where money is made in trading, is by being very thoughtful about what you're trying to do so that what you do over the long run makes sense. Let's dive right in. The first thing we need to start with is some context. This is a study that you should absolutely look at. It's called the behavior of individual investors. It's by Barbara Inodeen. I reference this all the time. It's an old study. It's from 2012. However, there are two things I really want to draw your attention to. These two right here. This study is about the behavior",

However, there are two things I really want to draw your attention to. These two right here. This study is about the behavior of individual retail investors or traders. It applies to both of the groups. And they find a bunch of specific habits that sabotage them. These two are important for you and for this video. The first one is the tendency to sell winning investments while holding losing investments. This is called the disposition effect. We enjoy the experience of booking a win. It affirms our ego. We were right. We also like making money. Who doesn't like that? The process of taking a winning trade down is so easy. And you've also probably heard a lot of really bad information like nobody goes broke by taking profits. Yeah, you actually can. You actually can. And I'm going to show you how. So it's not so much about any one individual trade. It's about a system of trades. The process that you follow, which we'll talk about. The second component here is naivery enforcement. This is where we essentially repeat behaviors that we enjoyed and avoid behaviors that we don't like. So a behavior like losing a position and closing a losing position. That sucks. So the propensity is going forward to avoid doing that or the process of really going",

So a behavior like losing a position and closing a losing position. That sucks. So the propensity is going forward to avoid doing that or the process of really going through in depth and analyzing what you're doing. That's another painful process because you're going to see a lot of things that you're doing that you may not like. And guess what? It's still part of the process. It's still part of this entire thing that over time pieces together into being a profitable trader long term. That's the goal here because if your goal is to just try to maximize any one individual trade, the overwhelming probability is you're not going to be good at this long term. And it's because it takes a process oriented approach to create success in trading. If you have a streak of winning trades, if you have a streak of winning trades for five years, that still doesn't matter. It doesn't matter unless you're going to stop at the five year mark, take your chips and walk away. Then it mattered. But if you're going to continue trading and you built a bunch of bad habits, you can still lose all of that money you built over five years. Let's dive into how to not lose that money.

So there's a couple of things I want to highlight. This is from a deck that I've been building kind of a reference deck, but I really want to draw your attention to these components. This is the decision cycle realistically as it applies to managing an options position. The first thing is managing a position based on profit and loss, meaning you should have defined profit and loss targets. If you have a position that hits either of those, then it's time to manage or at least evaluate the position. Does the individual position still align with your portfolio objectives? So what this looks like is if you're overall bullish in the market and you have a position that's bearish, does that position make sense? Maybe it does. That sets some of your long deltas. Maybe it doesn't. Maybe that position is morphed over time into something that doesn't align or fit with the broader portfolio. But this is the second step. The third step is have you been in the trade long enough, meaning your thesis is disproven or is it coming up on an expiration cycle where it's time to manage your trade? So there's two different examples in here. The first one is if you buy an option and you're coming",

So there's two different examples in here. The first one is if you buy an option and you're coming up on an expiration cycle, maybe you still want the position to be on. Your idea is still intact, but you're now at the point where theta decays really accelerating. Maybe it's time to adjust that position based on the time that you've been into the trade. Or you might at the onset of your trade say, well, I'm waiting for a breakout in stock X, Y or Z. And once I get that breakout, then I'm going to manage my profit here and my loss here. But if you're trading options, they all expire. So you can't wait for a breakout indefinitely, even if you're an investor. If you hold a stock that's going sideways for long enough, there's an opportunity cost to tying up your money in something that's not moving. So time is really important. The last two decision points is there's some sort of new event coming up that forces you to think about your position differently. So if you're looking at something like GameStop and you know that it has earnings coming up on the 4th of September, that's an event. So if you're building options positions in this, you have to know that this",

So if you're building options positions in this, you have to know that this is coming up. And you have to decide whether or not you want to hold through earnings, which tend to be pretty volatile. It could also be just broader news that's come out. For example, maybe small caps hasn't been performing well and you've been fading small caps. But then this past weekend, after there was that assassination attempt and now the market is attempting to price in the probability of somebody that's more market favorable in general and the eyes of the market coming into office against the now changing rate expectations. And then all of a sudden, your position starts going the exact opposite direction. There was a series of events that started triggering different market behaviors that you should be aware of. Because for example, maybe on the 11th, when we first started getting glimpses of the rate picture changing, maybe when this happened, it might not have hit your profit or lost target just yet. But if you're trading this to the downside and you see this big gap up and this new changing event, you now have to revisit your thesis.

How do we know when we're looking at profit and loss management? How do we know if it makes sense to close a trade down? Well first and foremost, this needs to be decided before you enter a trade, not while you're in it. The reason for that is when you are in a trade, you have risk on whether you are close to a robot seemingly emotionless or not, you still have subconscious processing and you know from what we talked about way back here that you are fighting a lot of innate behaviors that are baked into your psyche, baked into your biological processing. The way that human beings view commensurate risk and rewards once a baseline threshold is sustained is different. We don't view them the same. It's literally a psychological underpinning from your long standing biology based on survival. So punch line to all of this figure it out before you place your trade.

It doesn't have to be resolute and there are different things you can do while you're in the trade, which we'll talk about. So this very first concept I'm going to share with you is that of expected return. Now remember back towards the beginning of the video that I outlined that you can have a system that performs really well for a long time. So in this example, I'm showing you a system that has 190 winning trades, just 10 losing trades. The total number of trades there is 200. So you have a 95 chance of winning in just a 5 chance of losing. Yet, if we look at this system, it can still be not profitable. How could that possibly be? I'm going to show you. If you have an average win size of 10, you might say, well, that's not a lot at all. Yeah, well, you're winning all the time. You're probably not going to win a bunch of money if you're winning all the time. This is the example of take your profits. Take your profits quick. Don't be greedy. Sounds really smart. Don't be greedy. You're not supposed to be greedy. So there's a psychological component of not doing something that's looked down upon by society. And you're also looking at something and thinking",

I shouldn't be greedy. That means this should work in my favor. Wrong mindset entirely. Really you should be taking good risk reward trades. If you have of those 10 trades, your average loser is 190. You can then have 10 trades that come up to a total of 190 on average. You are now flat. You've made 200 trades and you are flat. This is not including opportunity cost of your money. This is not including fees. What I'm demonstrating to you is that you can absolutely have a massively high win rate. You can have a bunch of winning trades and a handful of losing trades can undo literally all of them, every single one of them. So this is why expected return is so important. We can use this to guide our decisions when we're placing trades. So now I want to look at an example with you. Let's take a peek again at GameStop. You want to get into these 30 calls that are at the money that are 31 days out. You can do that. You look to get into them for about 4.35. They're a 57 Delta. So",

What you need to do is figure out where you think this thing might go to the upside and where it might go to the downside and the corresponding probabilities. So let's figure out how to do that. If I take a look at a chart here and I'm just analyzing GameStop. Maybe I think that there's a floor here based off of this one July swing low. And that floor looks something around 23 and change. Maybe I can scoot it up a little bit because there's three of these candles here and you want to manage your risk kind of quick. So maybe you're looking at something just shy of 24, 24 ish. That would be your downside management. You are determining ahead of time based on your technical analysis or whatever tools you like to use that if you see price fall in this case below 24, you're going to exit to the downside and book a loss.

But as I look at this, it seems like there's not a bunch of overhead resistance. So maybe we target something around this. But if you want to be conservative, you could pick something kind of in the middle. So in this case, 35 bucks, something like that. It's above this previous high. It's something that's based off of elevation above this consolidation period. It's above the high here, slightly. And it's giving you a little bit of room to run, but we're not targeting highs necessarily because you may or may not get there. This is a conservative estimation. So using 35 bucks, target to the upside, 35 bucks, target to the downside is sub 24. So now what we need to do is figure out what the trade would be worth at both of those points. So if we look at 35 bucks, that'll give you about 350 profit. If we look at 24 to the downside, that'll give you like negative 263 ish.

How do I figure out these probabilities? You can use options, the cool part about them. So we can take a look either at something called a risk profile. You can use a tool like this that analyzes probabilities for you. This is just using the options, Shane's. And I'll show you in the options as well. Don't worry. But we can take a look at the probability of touching. Why do we not need in the money out of the money? Well, because if we're planning on managing when price gets to those levels, the probability of a touch is higher than the probability of expiring in the money. And if you don't need to take it all the way into expiration, then you don't need to use the lower probability. You can use the realistic probability of a touch. So we can go to our expiration cycle, which is about 30 days out. I think we're looking at the 16 August, which are right here. And we can say, what's the probability of hitting our profit of 35?

Let's go sub 24. We'll pretend we're get out below that. It's like 70 now. So it's actually a little higher than when I first made this video. It was 65. So we'll keep it as this, but that's what you would do. Now, if you don't want to use the risk profile tool, that's cool. You can also use the options. So you can take a look at the options, Shane. And you can say, well, you're buying the 30s. That's OK. But what's the probability that we touch 35? And you can take a look literally right here at the probability of a touch, 64.5. Typically speaking, the probability of a touch will be about about two times the delta. It does not work in very volatile products, right? Because the delta here is a 44 delta.

So to give you an example of this, what it would look like in something that's a little bit more normal, if we take a look at this 40 delta call in IWM, same expiration 31 days out, the 40 delta, two times that is 80. The probability of a touch here is 73.32. Right? So it's close. But in something like GameStop, that's volatile, very volatile. It's not going to be as accurate. The other thing to know about using delta is a probability of something being in the money or a probability of touching is the further out in time you go, the less accurate it is. I have an entire video that dives into this. I'll link that in the notes below. Delta is a probability for those interested. So just know that delta can be used shorter term time frames, less volatile products. Anything other than that, it's very inaccurate. And it's going to negatively impact your calculations, which are important calculations that we're doing. The next one, we need to figure out the probability of touching the 24s by 31 August. And you can see actually from the options chain, it mirrors more similarly to what I had in there. So these are at 22 delta, two times that would be a 44 probability of a touch, but it's actually 63.14. So you notice",

So these are at 22 delta, two times that would be a 44 probability of a touch, but it's actually 63.14. So you notice these are close enough, right? This is based on when I took it a little earlier today. So now we can calculate what the expected return is on this opportunity. So the expected return is 45 in 99 cents. So why is it? Why is this positive? Why do we have an R multiple of 1.29? Well, because even though the probabilities are pretty close, they're very similar to one another, this, you have the probability of making more money than you're going to lose. So even though this might be a lower probability trade, it still can yield a little bit more of a profit potential. So we need to continue through our example. So there I attached to you, the expected return, here I attached to you the R multiple. This is the exact process you can take to evaluate an individual trade. This is an individual trade. As I outlined before, it is important to do this for an entire system of trades. So for example, that's when you build your process, when you're buying options and you say, okay, well, I'm not going to do 31 days to expiration because they, they did case too fast.",

So I'm going to go further out in 60 days and you codify what you do. That's the process of building a strategy. I will link a video in the notes below on this process of building a strategy so that then you can bake this component of managing options, positions and expected return into that process. So you have a comprehensive approach that is much more likely to yield success than the haphazard process of buying random ass options. The last thing I'm going to throw in the notes below is a video on buying options smarter. I continue to push that video because I think it's so important for people to see it. I see all the time people talking about, well, I don't want to buy the forties because I don't think it's going to go to 40. What doesn't matter if it goes to 40? If it goes up, you start to make money anyways. That video goes through all of those kinds of details. As always, any questions, let me know. Be an outlier. Share with your friends. See you guys later.",
