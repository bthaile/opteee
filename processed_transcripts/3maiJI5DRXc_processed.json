    "text": "Volume over open interest is a great tool to eyeball where options are being built out in a specific either term expiration cycle or across terms. So what this means is we know when we see volume it can be an opening trader closing trade. But we know that options that exist day over day, they count as open interest. So when you see big volume over open interest, it tells you that it's not closing trades at least most of it because there's nothing to close. It's nothing that carried over from the prior day. So you can identify really interesting happenings like, for example, in HIMS today, you can see that there's a lot of instances where I know it's compressed, but volume over open interest here is like six times. So that means that there are six times volume compared to the open interest that's a position being built out. There's eight times volume over open interest here and so on and so forth. This one had 859 times volume over open interest. So you can look through these and find options that are being hit a lot and then come up with different trade ideas. You're not there, see I'll let her.",
