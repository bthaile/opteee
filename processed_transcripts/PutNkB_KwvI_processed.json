And we have a solid agenda for today. The first thing that we're going to spend time going through is the hopefully get a little bit deeper into our case old trades. I think we last left off. I'm looking at the sheet. We were in like 22 December of 2020. So we have a little bit ways to go, but I'm excited. It's definitely been taken a little bit longer than I was originally anticipating not that there's like a time hack that we have to stick to. The chat just completely disappeared. So, okay, I guess I am, there it is, like playing whack-a-mull. There we go. But we're getting a chance to go through kind of each position really, really far in detail. And to start us off, we have to start with any updates to our ape outlier sheet. So if you've already let me know where you're from, don't tell me again. But if I've not added you, let me know. And you can kind of check out the map and see what we might be missing. In the meantime, I got to say hello to everybody. So we got Samota. We got Lauren Lance, Derslup, roaring clitty, day swag, mock chicken. In case everybody's wondering, it's mock chicken. Pistol shrimp, that's a cool one. I",

So I told Newton that if you wanted to chattel a little bit during this one, he had a busy week. So he can't, but I told him I would shoot him a text with where we left off.

And then I'm going to go back to the correct time. So we need to go to 2020. Is it 21? Wait, no, 2020. That's why. Okay, so we don't have the positions yet. That's annoying. Oh, there we go. Okay, cool. So we need to go to December of 2020. We'll go to the 22nd. We'll look at the days it sits. And I saved all of his old positions. I think if not, I can reconstitute them really quick. I might have reset the account at one point. It's not a big deal. No, we still have them all. So then we'll use this as a quick fact check. I'm going to turn these ones off. I think these were from an example that I was giving. So let's mirror these really fast with exactly what he had. So we need this. And then I'm going to pull this over here just for a moment.

A thousand. And then he has .0726. So we'll analyze that. You got those other ones for 20. And then we have one other trade 16 April the 21 16 April 12.

Yeah, because I noticed that right out of the gate is when I look at his posting frequency, a couple things jump out at me. And one of the things that I noticed is like he went not posting a lot. Then he was going about a week in between his updates, which makes a ton of sense, right? Like posting a weekly update. That's like a very normal cadence. But then I notice this. It starts getting like really recent. And I don't know why. If any of you do tell me why please so that I can wonder no more. But right now I am wondering a lot because I don't actually get this.

You know, I love looking at some of those theories. So I am 100 down to take a look because the other thing that I got from the discord is somebody was asking about the dark pool orders that we recently got, which I think is worth taking a look at. That Lauren says was it in December 2021 that he posted a lot. Yeah. So what I noticed in December is that the frequency between posts went up a lot or like the latency between post went down frequency of post went up. So right now, like I'm typically seeing them do like once a month or once a week. Sorry for, you know, October, November, right? That's like a very steady cadence. It's about once a week.

And I'm right. So that's interesting. So total gain here is negative 107200. That's fucking crazy. That is fucking crazy. Wow. One man, I'm still like absorbing this. We have to take a look on the chart here because this is this is fucking crazy. 31 83 460 99 I've moved the wrong column here. 1953 457. That's 63. There we go. This makes way more sense. I was just being stupid. I was reading this is the total gain, not the day gain. Him losing 100,000 in a day is kind of whatever. Ron Clity says, I mean, one million gain in a day still feels good even if you're ready to be in there. Yeah, no, I agree with that. I totally agree. I think my point is is like for the lay person, like a normal human being, I would expect them to, you know, if they're doing really, you can look at this on Reddit, right?

Or roaring Kitty story. Yeah, I've not suggested that, Mr. Off-Pooten. The point of this part of the series is very specifically to analyze his trades. That's the point. The reason why I look at this is because I think we can get way more information on his behaviors, habits, what he sees. And most importantly, I have not, I don't know anybody that I've heard talk about his previous trades that I personally would take at face value personally. And that's not that I mistrust people because I think that they're trying to lie or mislead me. I think it's that people themselves tend to not understand how biased their recollection and analysis of things are. So, the whole point of this is for me to see for myself and as I'm seeing for myself to show you again what I'm seeing right now specifically from the trade perspective.

And now off Putin to your point, if there are offshoots that you think we should take a break and go look at while we're doing this because it's temporally related, like the Edgar story or something, let me know, right? Because that's the point. You guys as a community will know more about this collectively than I ever will. And that's just how it is.

Because right now, again, I've already identified some really, really clear trends and themes that I can clearly identify. So when I look at this again, like first, I can tell that he takes massively leveraged positions. Two, I can also tell that he takes massive amounts of concentrated risk that he leaves on. Three, I can tell you that he doesn't use stops of any sort. Four, I can tell you that in terms of portfolio volatility, he is entirely null to it. Five, I can tell you that he doesn't manage his option trades based on any sort of perceived profit or loss target.

The reason why is because if as a trader, your model of trading is an attempt to copy somebody else, I literally have never seen it done successfully. And the reason being is because in order to like fully copy somebody else, you have to either have to know what they're doing before they're doing it to do it with them. Or you have to adopt their entire brain, literally, because again, we'll see and because we know as we go further into the future, we'll see periods. I mean, let's look at an example together. And I'll ask you this. So if we take a look at this. And let me make it so that the quality is at least decent. So here's a dude. I'm going to zoom in and see you can see here's a dude that in an individual day, his trading account right now was at 350 million. He was down 235 million in a day, genuinely, genuinely.

Because this went even lower from here. So the whole point is that his disposition, his mentality towards trading is so anomalous. It is literally contrary to human genetic processing. It's completely different. And I'm not saying that it's unique to only him. It's not. There are other people out there that have some of these similar tendencies. But what I'm saying is that they are so few and far between that for most of us, for example, me, if I had this position and I was trying to trade this position or whatever, there's no way that I wouldn't have a stop on these options. Why is that? Why would I worry about having a stop on the options? Because I know that these options will continue to decay. I know that. So I would rather capture the profit as it starts to realize, then let it turn into a loss. That's like a relatively normal trader's mindset. His mindset is obviously completely different, which is why it's so freaking cool. But it's also why the idea of trying to essentially adopt what he does and do it yourself",

His mindset is obviously completely different, which is why it's so freaking cool. But it's also why the idea of trying to essentially adopt what he does and do it yourself would fail miserably, unless you have the ability to completely adopt his psychology, which again, reiterate the point, is a pure anomaly. It's a pure anomaly because again, the other thing I can tell you is that this dude doesn't really care that much about money. Obviously, he probably cares about money to a degree. I know that he has a family and he wants to take care of his family and stuff like that. I know all of that. But he could have never opened up another trade. And he could have lived the rest of his life with more money than he could ever need, but he chose not to. So it tells me something else about what motivates him and why he does this. So all of this is to go back to Sam's question on, why would we not want to trade like a guy who made a billion is because in order to trade like him, you have to adopt his entire world view, his entire paradigm. And I do not think the overwhelming majority of people can do that because it is so unique. It is so anomalous. That's why. Cedric says maybe he",

So what it tells me is that he's good at taking repeated risks, highly concentrated, and then letting the numbers kind of work out, which again, there is a portion of this that is like a coin flip. There is a certain amount of luck that's tied to this because one of the things that I look at is this here, right? Like he was already over 2.2 million. And then he contracts down eight days later in his total gain to 932. So he cut his value of his portfolio in half, in eight days.

But I continue to remind people that there is a healthy dose of luck that's included with this, which again is also important to remind people because when we look at somebody like Sam who asks a really normal question of why wouldn't we want to try to do this, well, it's because of all of these different reasons because it's not just skill that led to this. Again, skill, massive factor, luck, also massive factor. So that's why I'm so eager to see how the rest of this goes because we're getting a chance, we're getting a glimpse inside of what this all looks like from a trading perspective, which I'm like really, really excited for.

Okay. So the first thing I notice is that he's missing a lot of money. There's a big variance between what should be in the portfolio right now and what is. So I find that. I find that very interesting. Because his cash is sitting at essentially up 8 grand. The total gain down a mill. Obviously because one of his positions came down, but it's not captured in the cash. So this here looks like he took some money out of the account. Offputin says you missed that he just added 40 KGME shares. Yeah, I haven't even gotten into the updated positions. Offputin, I feel like this process confuses you because you did the same thing last time. Every single change that is going to happen in the account is going to be captured in these metrics.

So the reason why this isn't relative to the stock price, it doesn't matter what the stock price is. It doesn't change the variance that I see, because the stock price moved here as well. And it didn't, these matched perfectly. The stock price also changed over the course of this month. And again, they matched perfectly.

And then in doing so simultaneously, I'm looking at when he's managing positions and how. So like, for example, on this 5JAN expiration, I can clearly see that he managed some of these calls, which we're going to talk about. But I need to update this really quick.

And then let's take a look. We want the full chart. And then we need to go back further. Let's go to. I don't want months. I want daily candles. And then let's go back to December 2020. So this is where we're at. Okay. So. What happened here? The fifth of Jan. So he would have gotten out. Somewhere in here. So the 31st he posted. And then the next trading day was the 4th of Jan. So he would have gotten out, not here. But he would have gotten out on the 4th. Because the 4th or the 5th. I don't think it really matters that much. But it would have been the 4th or the 5th. This is. January 21 right now. Cedric says we were looking at 22. No, we're looking at 21. So",

But he obviously got out of the 10s. Now the thing that is just so strange. Uh, Rhino asks Eric, what's off about selling the 10s? It's a great question. So what I find so weird about taking the 10s down is when we look at the the movement of GameStop. And again, if we go to, so it wasn't the 31st that he did it, we know that for sure. It would have been like January, what the 5th we said. Whereas that one as the update was 5 Jan. So it would have been 4 Jan. So the thing that's so interesting about this is. The thing that's so interesting about this is that when I look at the options that he had, the 10s would have been in a better position to hold than the 20s.

There's essentially one scenario I can think of. Which is confounding to me. Raptor says he's hunting for gamma exposure technically he was still bullish. The gamma exposure doesn't matter right. So raptors walk me through that thought process. Why would he care about gamma in this case? If he has, let's go back to this scenario where he has the tens and the 20s. Why what does gamma have to do with this in your mind? Roy and Clity says if you're very sure the stock is going to push significantly past the 20 strike they would compound a lot harder than the tens. They would compound harder.

There's nothing to do with that. Because in this case what I make more money with the tens or the 20s, I have the same size in both. I have 1000 of both.

This is a really really really important point. So let's let's look at this together really quick. We'll look in GameStop and we'll just use today for an example. It doesn't really matter. Let's take a look. We can look at options that are going to come up in like what is this? Like 10 days. We'll use the four ox or whatever. It doesn't matter. The example will be the same.

So I don't think that's it either. Deswag says it's a guest lock in a known profit and keep the other for a yellow one big volatility. Both of them are showing a profit still. So I don't think that's it either. Ryan O'Sense he's betting on the squeeze. So he's doubling down since you're ready as 50 X is port. He's going for higher risk by losing the tens and going way out of the money. He already has this position though. So it's not that either. Right. So he's maintained this position for a long time. He established this back in like 25 November of even before that actually. So he's had this position for a long time. Now to drive this other point home hopefully to its entirety. I want to show you something. So if we take something again, I'm just going to use the same scenario. GameStop was trading at 1884. So he had options that were 8 in the money.

And I just want to show you the PNL difference because that's a big right? That's a big part of making decisions as a trader is understanding the movement of a position. So let's take a look at it. These tens were in the money. The 20s that he had were slightly out of the money. So we're using the 13s which serve as the tens, the 23s which serve as the 20s. So if I take a look at the 23s, which again look like the 20s, and we take a look at a 15 up move. The underlying goes up by 15. And again, I'm using the same entry price that he would have gotten into. So it's literally as close to an apples to apples comparison as you can come up with options that are obviously offset by time. Apples, apples, otherwise.

    "text": "So it's literally as close to an apples to apples comparison as you can come up with options that are obviously offset by time. Apples, apples, otherwise. So now when I look at this, I see seven cents. And if he got a 15 up move in this case, he would have made 283,000. If he would have had a 15 down move, he would have still made 12,000 because there's so far in the money. That again is looking at the 23s, which serve as the 20s. Let's take a look at the 13s. With the 13s, if he gets a 15 move in his favor, he makes 1.186 million. That serves as the tens. That's in comparison to 283,000. He would make 1.186. If the underlying goes down 15, he would still make 567,556. So even if it goes down 15, he still would make way more with these options than these other options. The other thing to add on top of this is the difference in X-Trensic value. These options, let's do the math. The 23s, the 23s are trading for, let's call it a dollar five. They're decaying at 6 a day. So 6 divided by 105 as a percentage is 5.7. Again, in a surrogate sense, these 20s are decaying away daily at a rate of 5.7 of the options value. If we go to the 13s, these are trading for, let's call it 8.90, beta on these is 3 divided by 8.90 times 100.",

So even in a raw, faded, decay perspective, he does way better holding the in the monies, offloading the out of the monies. Make no mistake. Says, what are we trying to prove here? Are cave made the wrong decision? No, no, no, no, I'm not saying he made the wrong decision at all. What I'm saying is he made a non-optimized decision, which to me means there's a reason why the decision was made. I have no fucking clue what it is.

But I'm trying to understand the thought process behind it because as I look at the decision across every single threshold of managing an options trade, it's suboptimal across the board. Each individual thing. But again, as I said in the beginning, there are like two things that I can think of that somebody would do this for. The first reason is because he wanted more dollars. So as we already identified, he went from 10,000 shares and he expanded to 50,000 shares at 14897. The problem here is, let's take a look at what that would cost. We can do some quick math. So we know if 50,000 shares, and his basis is 14, 88947. So his cost here equals this times this. So total cost here is 744,735. Before he had 10,000 shares, and his basis was 41133. Same thing. So now equals this minus this. So he needed blood swasey says, my guess he could buy more shares with the premium from the 10 at the fourth. Unfortunately, it's not true. He already had what he needed. So if you take a look, can you guys see the far right hand side over here? Kind of like where some of this scratch stuff is? If not, let me know. But that's that this is where the answer is, which is telling me that he didn't need it.",

Thank you for the heads up. Happy to call the cursing. You got it. Had cash plenty. 5H is exactly correct. 5H is 100 correct. He already had enough money. So he didn't need to sell those options. It wasn't for cash, which for me, that would have been the primary reason. Rhino says, I'm talking about me. Oh, Rhino, how old are you? If you're on here looking at this stuff, then cursing is probably on the board. And I got to be honest with you. I normally curse, but I can easily turn it off if there's a good reason.

So now, because that takes a lot of brain capacity for your boy, that's like it can be done, but I have to like really think about it. All right. So all of this stuff aside, what do we know now? There's a couple things that we know with certainty. He did not need to sell either of these. He had the money to buy the shares that he wanted. He also across the board unwound a completely suboptimal position. And I don't know why I do not know why. And the reason why is because across the board, it would have made so much more sense to take the 20s down. And then to leave the tens, he would have made more money in total either direction. And they decay way, way, way less quickly. So this is a question mark. This is one of those things that I kind of earmark as something weird happened. And I don't know what.

So let's see, these were trading for 8.90. So what's our extrinsic value? These are, let's go, we can use the same thing that we're looking at now. It's all the same. So 21, 85, minus 13 is 885. So in this scenario, he had 885 intrinsic value. And what I'm doing right now is I'm just showing you an example of something. This is obviously looking at the front expiration, meaning today, but it doesn't matter. The example will hold about the same. So let's say that he has about five to 10 cents of extrinsic value. Let's call it 10 cents, which is 10 per contract times a thousand contracts. That's essentially lighting 10,000 on fire. I don't think he did that. So the reason why I don't think he exercised is because it doesn't, and it literally, again, it's just tremendously economically inefficient. He would be better by just buying.

You've been sitting on the cash for a while. DFV, maybe I will. Yeah, well, that's after this, right? So he already did. So here it he bought more.

Because the basis is much higher than what his strike was. Cedric says, sorry for spam, but market makers aren't hedging for exercise for the tens. They are. Of course they are. What are you talking about? That's exactly what they're doing. Oh, Mills hit me up for dinner. I'm going to try Mexican. See if I can get Mexican through. Cedric says they already did. It's my point. Lauren says no Mexican. Damn it. Lauren. That's what I was going to go for. Fuck. Then maybe no Mexican. Cedric says for the 20s, they still have some hedging to go.

So when we look at his position on these 20s, we can see that his total gain here is 289,000. This is when GameStop was trading at 2015. Now if we go to where we are now, 11 Jan, GameStop is trading at 1994. So about the same price. But these 20s are now only showing him 122,700. So that's like 150 grand almost that essentially went away just because of theta decay. And again, there's a slight delta component to it, but it's slight. The majority of this variance comes from theta decay, which is crazy. And again, it's it's why managing these 20s earlier just makes sense across the board. I just don't understand this. 13th.

So the variance in like portfolio value and stuff lines up. I just don't understand that. The 19th will do the 22nd point. Which shows no change again.

I imagine some of it has to be him being like any of us would be, which is just being like, this is fucking crazy. And he's got to enjoy like showing people how nuts this portfolio is going. 1 7 5 9 7 9 9 7. So clear match there. And he's still holding those Aprils. And now 22 Jan 21 840 Te. And we ride on.

Roeing could he says getting up to 2.6 million wasn't taking profits. It not the same. So what I notice in these other trades here is these other trades like exiting the 17s and the 15s, I would call that taking profits because in this case, it's very clear that these still had plenty of time left. And he's taking some value off the table. Then we have this example with the tens in the 20s, which is not about taking profit at all. That's very clear because he holds them all the way in almost to 10 DTE for the tens. And he takes those down again, which doesn't make sense. So this one is very confusing to me. Then he holds the 20s essentially up until one DTE, which also is not profit taking. In that case, his hand is forced by time. So here when he's managing further out in time, I consider that profit taking because it's being done when the options aren't expiring. There's",

So here when he's managing further out in time, I consider that profit taking because it's being done when the options aren't expiring. There's plenty of time left. That's also what I notice here is that there is still plenty of time left in these options. But the fact that he's choosing to take profits there tells me that it's based on something resembling to profit. It's not being based on time. This is the fun stuff to me, like to be able to analyze this level of detail and to gather these kinds of components is so interesting to me. A future whale 747. I literally love that name. Does have you ever investigated someone's trades the way you're doing with keys right now? No, absolutely not. And I mean, to be honest, the majority of the reason why I'm doing this with is because I'm doing it with you guys. I think that this adds a lot of color to the story, but I personally, like if I was doing this in my own research, I wouldn't go into this layer of detail. What I would do is just gloss over the trades. But since the entire game stop story has a really critical component being Roryan Kitty, then I think that like understanding his movements here is really, really important. So",

I'm going to trade the way that I trade the way that I've been trading for almost 20 years now. I'm going to keep doing just that. So what other people do is generally completely, I don't care. Now for him, it's very unique because he's also this strange actor in the space that does things so differently. That's very, very fun to watch. So yeah, it's definitely unique. The layer of detail I'm going here. Blancways, he says, but at one DT, he still made up, he still made the most profit. No. Let's double check. So at one DTE that was on the 14 Jan update. Well, they were gone. 13. They were here. Yeah, definitely. So he. Those are at 31 40. 30. Yeah, so he would have made over a million dollars on those calls. Here.

In this case, he got really lucky with respect to the pop happening when it did to drive the profit that much. Because again, like if you go back to 11 Jan, his total gain was 122,000. And it popped to over a million dollars. And it popped to over a million in two days later. So like that is here, fucking luck. And the other component that these are tied to expiring four days from here. So what I can tell you is that Roy and Kitty at this point, he was these were going to be whatever they were going to be. Either he was going to take him in and he was going to lose this amount of money, which he didn't care about. Obviously, or they were going to be something he wanted to take down. And that's why he chose to not take it into expiration, but take it down before expiration is because they had perceivably made enough that he cared enough.

So what this tells me is that. He's scaling out like he's absolutely scaling out. I can watch it real time. So he first started scaling out on the 25th. Here. He let that run. Then on the 27th, he started scaling out more. But it was a really relatively light scale out. And then he kept the shares. And he kept. And he was 100 of those contracts.

Red says crazy that he didn't sell any covered calls at those levels. Yeah. I actually agree with you. I would have been especially on 50,000. You could have. Absolutely offered. That's another thing that I think is important to know. Actually now that you mention it is the fact that I. I don't actually see that. I see essentially no evidence that he runs covered calls at all. But that doesn't mean that he doesn't, it just means that I don't really see it. So yeah, cool. Well, we got through January of 2021 and our next one will be the first of Feb. I'm going to take a pause though on this part of things so that we can start taking a look at just some current date stuff if you guys want or any other like theories or thesis that we want to take a look at.

What should I tell Newton? The main things I noticed are running through January. So January 2021. I noticed a few themes. The first theme that I noticed is that some, well, not even some one specific one particular one to tick you learn options trade. Exiting in the money and keeping out of the money. Didn't make sense. But ended up working out of lucky price movement leading two days. Into expiration. Pam says tell Newton that his hair is glorious. Okay, Pam says your hair is glorious. And from the chat. Okay. The other thing I noticed is that previously, I can see a habit. So I can see, I can see some habit of profit taking where options have longer time frames remaining. But he takes either full or partial exits. I can also see there are several instances of smaller amounts of money. So around like 10K. Around 10K. Being withdrawn. From the account.

The problem though is I need to know how many shares from the Edgar filing. Can you guys drop that in the discord so I can take a look. Dr. Zayas, is that what you dropped in here? No, that's from December. Okay, so the. Riven says 9 June 2023. Okay, let's take a look at that one. Okay, cool. 253,000 shares. Thank you. So let's go to 2023. Okay. And 253,000 shares. So yeah, here it got broken up as well. Not a solid. Not a solid transaction. So the only reason why this really matters is the fact that it's not like a solid transaction means we can't clearly delineate when they've happened is what it boils down to. So yeah, it's limited efficacy to tell whether it went through dark pool or let exchange.

So I think that's the only reason why they exist is to try to prevent front running, but it's not the name is way more nefarious than what they actually are. I think most people confuse dark pool orders with internalized orders, which are very different internalized orders do not hit the consolidated tape. In internalized order at some point would have already hit the tape because of the original transaction that occurred now it doesn't help with any sort of sense of market efficiency transparent markets at all. So that's the problem with internalized orders is that we're not seeing updated transactions there. So when we're looking at this, this is all stuff that still eventually hits the consolidated tape. That Lauren says on Friday, a lot of volume came in pre and after hours is that why partially it's because a lot of larger institutions will access the market during pre and post trading hours. It's because there's also a tendency for larger trades to come in towards the beginning of the day and towards the end of the day, you'll find this almost any single day that you look at the market.

Where if we do let's do like a five day five minute chart, if you take a look at the volume mid day pretty much every day, even here where volume was really high on a relative basis, you'll still see volume slump towards the middle of the day. This is very, very common. Now there's always anomalies right so volume spiked up for this a little bit, but then still came down. That's just very, very normal to see volume towards the beginning and the end of the day. There's nothing really remarkable about that. That's just standard market activity. That's why like professional traders like myself, most of my transactions are done towards the end of the day. I don't trade a ton intraday. I'll trade like zero DTEs and stuff like that. Intraday or you know during more like non normal portions of the day, but even as a professional retail trader. I'm still trading at a size that doesn't really matter.
