The chat just completely disappeared. So okay, I guess I am, there it is, like playing Wacomoll. There we go. But we're getting a chance to go through kind of each position really, really far in detail. And to start us off, we have to start with any updates to our ape outlier sheet. So if you've already let me know where you're from, don't tell me again. But if I've not added you, let me know. And you can kind of check out the map and see what we might be missing. In the meantime, I got to say hello to everybody. So we got Samota, we got Lauren Lance, Derslup, roaring clitty, day swag. Mark Chicken, case everybody's wondering it's mock chicken. Pistol shrimp, that's a cool one. I think we have, I don't know if we have Toronto, we definitely have Ottawa. Let's see, do we have Toronto? Lido? We do not, now we do. We have Toronto. Beautiful. I think we have Atlanta. You got to be careful moving around Atlanta though. You don't need to get, don't need to get shot. Nope, we don't have Atlanta now we do. Kyoto, Japan, I don't know if we have Kyoto on here. We do not. I think we have one other from, I guess we",

And then we were looking south somewhere in like Provo I think. But yeah, we were originally potentially looking at moving there. Then we got five H trades from Williams, Arizona, it literally never hurt that. Where is Williams? Oh, dude, no way. That's hilarious. So five H, fun fact. My brother, he's in Flagstaff. So I go out to Flagstaff every once in a while to go see him. But we come, we go south, right? Because I'm in San Diego. Sooner or more we go out the eight and then up the 17. So yeah, that's hilarious. It just never been, yeah, Williams didn't click for whatever reason. But yeah, that's been out there a bunch. Then we got JD, do we have Iowa? Let's see. Do we have Iowa?

We were looking at going here, but they looked really small. So we opted out of it for now at least, but maybe we'll land there. Cool. So we got a couple new updates on our map.

So what we've been doing is going through each of his trade updates and essentially tracking what the positions were. And then I started adding some qualitative notes around when he's managing the positions to close because I'm very, very interested in those personally. And the primary reason why I'm so interested in those is because I think they're going to be, I think we're going to see some common threads that we will start to learn from in terms of how he's thinking about options. Because I've said this before, I think right now when I look at his options positions, I genuinely see them as just leveraged long exposure. They're not seemingly predicated on a certain amount of time in the trade yet. But my guess is that's what we're going to find is that they're going to be predicated by time, not by some sort of price target. So I told Newton that if you wanted to chattel a little bit during this one, he had a busy week. So he can't, but I told him I would shoot him",

And then the other thing I need to do is get into on demand because we were tracking his individual trades in here. And then I'm going to go back to the correct time. So we need to go to 2020. Is it 21? Wait, no, 2020. That's why. Okay. So we don't have the positions yet. That's annoying. Well, there we go. Okay. Cool. So we need to go to December of 2020. We'll go to the 22nd.

OK, so if we look at, I'm actually, because I'm very specific with the way that I like to input data, I really don't like skipping things.

Then he was going about a week in between his updates, which makes a ton of sense, right? Like posting a weekly update, that's like a very normal cadence. But then I noticed this, it starts getting like really recent. And I don't know why. If any of you do, tell me why, please, so that I can wonder no more. But right now, I am wondering a lot because I don't actually get this. And then this, I'm just going to hold down a little bit further because we're going to keep going here. Dark Gensers, I think we get one more downturn before GME Moons, DFV, like unlikely in yet. Yeah, we'll definitely take time to bounce between different theories.

Or like the latency between posts went down frequency of posts went up. So right now, like I'm typically seeing them do like once a month or once a week, sorry. Or you know, October, November, right?

And then this one is also good. I just realized that's incorrectly flagged. Okay. All right. So now let's take a look. Yeah, 31 D's. So this to me looks like he's just enjoying posting more. That's what I see here. Like it's got to be something to do with the account. Like take a look at the account. Well, he already saw 2 million. So this isn't anything about novel. This isn't novel about being above 2 million. He was already there. So it's not like he's like, oh yeah, you know, I you guys have been calling me fucking crazy and I'm right. So that's interesting. So total gain here is negative 107 200. That's fucking crazy. That is fucking crazy. Wow. One man, I'm still like absorbing this. We have to take a look on the chart here because this is this is fucking crazy. 31 83 or 60 99. I've moved the wrong column here. 1953 or 57. Got 63. There we go. This makes way more sense.

Because I'm not in no way what I'm doing now. Am I suggesting that this is like the GameStop story or Newton story? Noon. I don't know why I say Newton's on the brain. Sorry. Or Rory and Kitty's story. Yeah, I've not suggested that, Mr. Offputin. The point of this part of the series is very specifically to analyze his traits. That's the point.

The reason why is because if as a trader, your model of trading is an attempt to copy somebody else, I literally have never seen it done successfully. And the reason being is because in order to like fully copy somebody else, you have to let you either have to know what they're doing before they're doing it to do it with them or you have to adopt their entire brain literally because again, we'll see and because we know as we go further into the future, we'll see periods.

So here's a dude, I'm going to zoom in so you can see here's a dude that in an individual day, his trading account right now was at 350 million. He was down 235 million in a day, genuinely, genuinely. If you were thinking about being this guy, is this what you would do? The only person that would say yes, is the kind of person that says yes with the benefit of hindsight knowing what may or may not happen and really the benefit of hindsight is terrible, right? Because this went even lower from here. So the whole point is that his disposition, his mentality towards trading is so anomalous. It is literally contrary to human genetic processing. It's completely different. And I'm not saying that it's unique to only him. It's not. There are other people out there that have some of these similar tendencies.

His mindset is obviously completely different, which is why it's so freaking cool. But it's also why the idea of trying to essentially adopt what he does and do it yourself would fail miserably, unless you have the ability to completely adopt his psychology, which again, reiterate the point is a pure anomaly. It's a pure anomaly because again, the other thing I can tell you is that this dude doesn't really care that much about money. Obviously, he probably cares about money to a degree. I know that he has a family and he wants to take care of his family and stuff like that. I know all of that, but he could have never opened up another trade and he",

So it tells me something else about what motivates him and why he does this. So all of this is to go back to Sam's question on, why would we not want to trade like a guy who made a billion is because in order to trade like him, you have to adopt his entire world view, his entire paradigm. And I do not think the overwhelming majority of people can do that because it is so unique. It is so anomalous. That's why. Cedric says, maybe he sees something that gives him insane win rate if certain conditions are right potentially, but I can also tell you again, by looking at the data that it's not true, right? Because there's obviously he's a fantastic trader, but he's not great at timing things so far.

So in this case, I think that again, brilliant, brilliant thesis, brilliant conviction, really good use of leverage, right? Like I can identify lots of really good things that happened here, but I continue to remind people that there is a healthy dose of luck that's included with this, which again is also important to remind people because when we look at somebody like Sam who asks a really normal question of why wouldn't we want to try to do this, well, it's because of all of these different reasons because it's not just skill that led to this.

The total gain down a mill. Obviously because one of his positions came down, but it's not captured in the cash. So this here looks like he took some money out of the account. Offputin says you missed that he just added 40 KGME shares. Yeah, I haven't even gotten into the updated positions. Offputin, I feel like this process confuses you because you did the same thing last time. Every single change that is going to happen in the account is going to be captured in these metrics. I don't have to look at the individual positions to note changes because regardless of where they go, I can still see them. So because to your point, when I'm looking at the change in individual positions that's going to be captured in total gain cash relative to value. So I'm going to see all of that.

So if I add another column to maybe help with this point, if we take a look at the overall value compared to what's in there. So in this case, there's like a 600,000 value variance here. Putin says from the previous statement to the one you're looking at, he went from 10 to 50K. Yeah, I know, dude. I know. I'm aware. I'm following you, bro. He also offloaded a thousand options. I am right there with you. Again, the point that I'm trying to make no mistakes as the spreadsheet is flawed, the stock price dropped. The account value dropped 380K, which makes sense. It's not. So the reason why this isn't relative to the stock price, it doesn't matter what the stock price is. It doesn't change the variance that I see, right? Because the stock price moved here as well, right? And it didn't, these matched perfectly. The stock price also changed over the course of this month. And again, they matched perfectly.

And then in doing so simultaneously, I'm looking at when he's managing positions and how. So like, for example, on this 5JAN expiration, I can clearly see that he managed some of these calls, which we're going to talk about. But I need to update this really quick. This needs to be 5JAN, 22. So with 10 DTE. Because I think that this matters. I don't know how it matters yet, but I think it does. So here he exited as well. We'll flag that and we'll flag that. And then here, oh no, he didn't exit here. I'm about, he exited here. So he, no, I was right. So here he exited the tens, which I just would not expect that 15JAN 21 tens. Just don't get. We have some, we have some homework to do. Gang, I need to figure this out. Why, why did he do this? Okay, so now let's update his position. He had them for 20.

And then let's go to like the end of DEES of 21. Something like this. So there is a lot here that's, oops messed up my bet. I have to get the right options. We have to go to 2020. That's my bet. DEES 2020, the 31st. Because these will still trade. So now let's take a look at what charting we're reusing. We had a good charting tool that let us go back in time. Was Yahoo Finance? When I say good, I think that's relative because it seems to be annoying every time we look at it. But I think Yahoo Finance is what we've been using. For GameStop. And then let's take a look. We want the full chart. And then we need to go back further. Let's go to I don't want months. I want daily candles.",

The fifth of Jan. So he would have gotten out somewhere in here. So the 31st he posted. And then the next trading day was the 4th of Jan. So he would have gotten out not here. But he would have gotten out on the 4th. Because the 4th or the 5th. I don't think it really matters that much. But it would have been the 4th or the 5th. This is January 21 right now. Cedric says we were looking at 22. No, we're looking at 21. So the positions that were kind of catching up on right now are these 15 Jan 21s, the 20s and the 12s in 16 April. But he obviously got out of the 10s. Now the thing that is just so strange. Rhino asks Eric what's off about selling the 10s. It's a great question. So what I find so weird about taking the 10s down is when we look at the movement of GameStop. And again, if we go to, so it wasn't the 31st that he did it, we know that for",

So the thing that's so interesting about this is is the thing that's so interesting about this is that when I look at the options that he had, the 10s would have been in a better position to hold than the 20s. But by holding the 20s, like I, I, I, I, I, I, I don't know why he would do that. Okay, so let me explain. I know I'm not explaining. I'm still it is because I'm like, I'm trying to process at the same time. And by doing that, I'm explaining nothing. So I apologize. So let's, let's look at an example. This will probably make it a little more clear to you. So when I take a look at his position here. And let's go back one to 31 Ds. Okay. So we're looking at two different sets of options.

Roy and Clity says, 10 delta way higher. Dr. Zayas, 10 delta will be higher exactly. Okay. Great. So now if you had this position on and let's, let's think about another really important point. So the day that he's posting this, 31 Ds and then 5 Jan. So now his options expire 15 Jan. Which of these options is going to have more Thaited a K, the 10s or the 20s? Right now in this last update game, stop was at 18 E4. If we go to this point, it's at 17. Which one of these options is going to have more Thaited a K? The 20s, blonde, swaisy is correct, the 20s.

So raptures walk me through that thought process. Why would he care about Gamma in this case? If he has, let's go back to this scenario where he has the 10s and the 20s. Why what does Gamma have to do with this in your mind? Roe and Clity says if you're very sure the stock is going to push significantly past the 20 strike, they would compound a lot harder than the 10s. They would compound harder. But which one would you actually make more money in? Roe and Clity is wrong. Roe and Clity's on a very good and fair thought process I understand it, but it's wrong. There's nothing to do with that. Because in this case, what I make more money with the 10s or the 20s, I have the same size in both. I have 1000 of both. We just said that the 10s are higher delta's.

Right. So he's maintained this position for a long time. He established this back in like 25 November of even before that actually. So he's had this position for a long time. Now to drive this other point home, hopefully to its entirety. I want to show you something. So if we take something again, I'm just going to use the same scenario. GameStop was trading at 1884. So he had options that were 8 in the money. So essentially we can do the same thing in this case. We can just pick options that are 8 in the money. So we can go to like these 13s. We could pretend that we bought these for whatever price. Let's just say that we got them for 20 cents or the example and we have a thousand of them. This simulates his tens that are 8 in the money. I'm going to turn the other ones off for now so that we can just look at this example together. Then with GameStop at 1884, he also had options that were 1.20 higher.",

Then with GameStop at 1884, he also had options that were 1.20 higher. So that would take us to like these 23s. And again, he had a thousand of those. And then he would have got those again in this case for like seven cents. Not slash decimal zero seven. First, let me take a pause. Does what I'm doing right now make sense? Do you understand why I'm picking these options to show you? What I'm doing is I'm creating a current date example of what his position would look like. And what I'm going to show you is how these two different positions behave based on similar size moves because Reese says none of this makes sense. But yes, I'm following. That's that's not about right. Because I mean, this is all crazy. So what I'm showing you though jokes aside is I'm showing you what these tens and these 20s would have looked like for him. And I just want to show you the PNL difference because that's a big right. That's a big part of making decisions as a trader is understanding the movement of a position. So let's take a look at it.

So if I take a look at the 23s, which again look like the 20s. And we take a look at a 15 up move. The underlying goes up by 15. And again, I'm using the same entry price that he would have gotten into. So it's literally as close to an apples to apples comparison as you can come up with options that are obviously offset by time. Apples apples otherwise. So now when I look at this, I see seven cents. And if he got a 15 up move in this case, he would have made 283,000. If he would have had a 15 down move, he would have still made 12,000 because there's so far in the money. That again is looking at the 23s which serve as the 20s. Let's take a look at the 13s. With the 13s, if he gets a 15 movement his favor, he makes 1.186 million. That serves as the tens. That's in comparison to 283,000. He would make 1.186. If the underlying goes down 15, he would still make 567,556. So",

He would make 1.186. If the underlying goes down 15, he would still make 567,556. So even if it goes down 15, he still would make way more with these options than these other options. The other thing to add on top of this is the difference in X-Trensic value. These options, let's do the math. The 23s. The 23s are trading for, let's call it 1.05 and they're decaying at 6 a day. So 6 divided by 105 as a percentage is 5.7. So again, in a surrogate sense, these 20s are decaying away daily at a rate of 5.7 of the options value. If we go to the 13s, these are trading for, let's call it 890. Beta on these is 3 divided by 890 times 100. These are decaying at 0.34. These options are decaying light years slower than these. On a daily basis as a gross dollar amount, we can do that as well. Let's take a look. He has a 1,000 contracts. So, and I'm walking you through the math so you could do it yourself. He has a 1,000 contracts times 6 cents, times 100. He's losing 6,000 a day on this position here. If we take a look at this, he has 1,000 contracts at 3 cents. He's losing",

So even in a raw, faded, decayed perspective, he does way better holding the in the monies, offloading the out of the monies. Make no mistake. Says, what are we trying to prove here? Are cave made the wrong decision? No, no, no, no, I'm not saying he made the wrong decision at all. What I'm saying is he made a non-optimized decision, which to me means there's a reason why the decision was made. I have no fucking clue what it is. But I'm trying to understand the thought process behind it because as I look at the decision across every single threshold of managing an option straight, it's suboptimal across the board, each individual thing. But again, as they said in the beginning, there are like two things that I can think of that somebody would do this for. The first reason is because he wanted more dollars. So as we already identified, he went from 10,000 shares and he expanded to 50,000 shares at 14897. The problem here is let's take a look at what that would cost. We can do some some quick math.

We can do some some quick math. So we know of 50,000 shares and his basis is 14, 8,8947. So his cost here equals this times this. So total cost here is 744,735. Before he had 10,000 shares, and his basis was 41133, 41133. Same thing. So now equals this minus this. So he needed blood swasey says, my guess he could buy more shares with the premium from the 10 at the fourth. Unfortunately, it's not true. He already had what he needed. So if you take a look, can you guys see the far right hand side over here? Kind of like where some of this scratch stuff is? If not, let me know. But that's that this is where the answer is, which is telling me that he didn't need it. Because what happened here is he went from 10,000, which was a total basis of 41K to 50,000, which is a total basis of 744. The delta between these, the variance is 703,602. So that's what he needed. He needed 703,602 in order to put on this new position. Take a look at his cash. What do you notice? Something very important. Do you see what I see? I see. Rhino says no cursing.

And the reason why is because across the board, it would have made so much more sense to take the 20s down. And then to leave the tens, he would have made more money in total either direction. And they decay way, way, way less quickly. So this is a question mark. This is one of those things that I kind of earmark as something weird happened. And I don't know what. Brett says, is it possible that he sold some but exercise 400 of them to get the 50k wouldn't make any sense to do that? No, he could have, but it would have made no sense. I know that people are like really interested in the exercise scenarios and it's fair. Let's talk about it. So let's see. These were trading for 8.90. So what's our extrinsic value? These are, let's go. We can use the same thing that we're looking at now. It's all the same. So 21, 85 minus 13 is 885. So in this scenario, he had 885 intrinsic value.

So in this scenario, he had 885 intrinsic value. And what I'm doing right now is I'm just showing you an example of something. This is obviously looking at the front expiration, meaning today, but it doesn't matter. The example will hold about the same. So let's say that he has about five to 10 cents of extrinsic value. Let's call it 10 cents, which is 10 per contract times a thousand contracts. That's essentially lighting 10,000 on fire. I don't think he did that. So the reason why I don't think he exercised is because it doesn't, it, again, it's just tremendously, economically inefficient. He would be better by just buying. The other thing we can do actually is to just figure out essentially what the, what the, oh, let me see. So he added 40,000, give me one second. I need to do a little bit of math. What I'm doing is I'm going to take a look at the exact basis. Blancways, he said, so we sold them and took the cash out of his account. Cash moved for sure. I don't know where or why, but cash did move. And this looks like day swags says, citing 10,000 on fires when he lit 200 million on fire. I'm not thinking or carrying",

Well, the thing is, where do you mean that he lit 200 million on fire? Where did that happen? Because here's what I can tell you. Here's what I, off Putin says from the DFV chat after the 5GIN was posted, Redditor, maybe you should use that 1.1 million to buy more shares. You've been sitting on the cash for a while. DFV, maybe I will. Yeah, well, that's after this, right? So he already did. So here it he bought more. So if we take a look at this, if we look at the total position here, here's what we would do. We would take equals. So we would take this times this, this, this times this divided by this minus this. So this tells me essentially, let me grab this. And then now we need to take the total cost of these positions. So this equals this minus this divided by this minus this. That's what he added the shares for.

We could figure that out. I don't really care enough to if I'm being honest with you, but we could figure it out by looking at the change in the portfolio. It would just be a little bit annoying, I think, and not actually very elucidating. So yeah. Okay. So I think we've analyzed this enough at this point, though, that we know a few things happened. We know without a doubt that there's some really strange behavior here. We know that he clearly chose to take the in the monies down while holding that out of the monies, which are still decaying, we know that that doesn't actually make sense from a holding perspective. It just doesn't make sense because no matter what, he's going to he doesn't stand to make as much and he doesn't stand to make as much to the downside if things go against him.

But all right, so now we need to go catch up and we need to move on. So now we did five JAN, so now we need 11 Jan. Long Sways says new guests kept his buying power increased the share position a lot. Uh, could have been a, but I don't actually see why. I mean, we'll find out. But I don't see why he would do that. All right, let's take a look now at we're in 11 Jan 21. So 11 Jan 21. Total gain here is now 1236974.03. The cash on hand is about the same. So 1128842.2. And then the total value is 3158842.2. Same same. So I don't see the, the large variance at this point between the account value. So it does look like he previously pulled capital out. Again, I'm not sure why. And then he has the same residual positions. The fascinating part is he still has these 20 calls. That's crazy at this point. That's absolutely crazy. So he's still holding these 15 Jan 20s. They literally expire in nine days. 15 Jan, no, four days. My bad. What on earth? I just don't understand this. Fascinating. So same position now. We're long 50. Dr. Zay says, does him holding 20s the longer influence the gamma ramp now? Not really.",

So when we look at his position on these 20s, we can see that his total gain here is 289,000. This is when GameStop was trading at 2015. Now if we go to where we are now, 11 Jan, GameStop is trading at 1994. So about the same price, but these 20s are now only showing him 122,700.

I can see that he exited some of these longer term the 15 Jan 21s, the 17s and the 15s. And he got out of those like two months, a month, slash two months in advance. Which is nuts. Absolutely nuts.

We'll just spend the first part doing this, 21, because this is, I find this stuff interesting, but I also imagine some of you might not find it quite as enthralling, but I still do want to make sure that we get through all of this, even if it takes a little while, that I think it's really important.

So if we take a look at the positions, we can see some of this was trimmed off. So we can see that the 16 the 16 April the 12s. They were at a thousand. So he's took he's taken 200 of those down. So that's why we see this change in that. So he's holding this, but it's a partial profit. So this would be partial profit on 16 April. 12 calls. And he did 200. Lots sold. And this is 81 DTE.",

So this would be partial profit on 16 April. 12 calls. And he did 200. Lots sold. And this is 81 DTE. So really far out in time. So this is one of the great mysteries that I have in my mind when I look at him. Let's take a look at what this look like on the day. So this is 25, Jan. I want to zoom it in so that it's like just a month. So the 25th. It started popping up massively. So this looks like him taking profits. This is like the first time I've gotten a glimpse of him doing something that looks like taking profits. Which is really interesting because if I look at this from a timing perspective, I again, from like a standard trading line of thought, this is not at all where I would take profits personally. And it's because it's like it's been trending sideways for a while. And then it starts really exploding up. I mean to me, this looks like exactly where I wouldn't want to take profits. I would want to let them go. And the options still have over 80 days to expiration. So just yet another really, really interesting thing.

RoeingClitty says getting up to 2.6 million wasn't taking profits. It not the same. So what I notice in these other trades here is these other trades like exiting the 17s and the 15s, I would call that taking profits because in this case, it's very clear that these still had plenty of time left. And he's taking some value off the table. Then we have this example with the 10s and the 20s, which is not about taking profit at all. That's very clear because he holds them all the way in almost to 10 DTE for the 10s. And he takes those down again, which doesn't make sense. So this one is very confusing to me. Then he holds the 20s essentially up until one DTE, which also is not profit-taking. In that case, his hand is forced by time. So here, when he's managing further out in time, I consider that profit-taking because it's being done when the options aren't expiring. There's plenty of time left. That's also what I notice here is that there is still plenty of time left in these options. But the fact that he's choosing to take profits there tells me that it's based on something resembling to profit, it's not being based on time. This is the fun",

To be able to analyze this level of detail and to gather these kinds of components is so interesting to me. Future Whale 747, I literally love that name. Does have you ever investigated someone's trades the way you're doing with Keith right now? No, absolutely not. And to be honest, the majority of the reason why I'm doing this is because I'm doing it with you guys. I think that this adds a lot of color to the story. But I personally, like if I was doing this in my own research, I wouldn't go into this layer of detail. What I would do is just gloss over the trades. But since the entire GameStop story has a really critical component being Roryne Kitty, then I think that like understanding his movements here is really, really important. So yeah, no, definitely not to like going along by line like this. Because I've said it a million times, I really don't care what other traders do. Like it makes no difference to me. I'm going to trade the way that I trade, the way that I've been trading for almost 20 years now. And I'm going to",

So at one DTE that was on the 14 Jan update, well, they were gone. 13, they were here. Yeah, definitely. So he, those are at 31, 40, 30. Yeah. So he would have made over a million dollars on those calls here. So definitely, he ended up getting at the very, and again, like this is this is the stuff that I'm talking about.

So what I can tell you is that Roy and Kitty, at this point, he was, these were going to be whatever they were going to be. Either he was going to take him in and he was going to lose this amount of money, which he didn't care about, obviously, or they were going to be something he wanted to take down.

And he would have taken them down either the, well, not the 13th, he would have taken them down on the 14th. Because I think you guys have told me he posted these after the market closed. Yeah. Yeah.

So here we had another partial profit, which was 300, 300 lots, holding 500 of the 16 April of calls. So this tells me something really important, actually. Of a lot of me says, January 27 was the day that the buy button was turned off for Robinhood users, got it. Yeah, so what this tells me is that he's scaling out, like he's absolutely scaling out. I can watch it real time. He first started scaling out on the 25th here. He let that run. Then on the 27th, he started scaling out more, but it was a relatively relatively light scale out. And then he kept the shares, and he kept still 500 of those contracts. But again, this tells me very much that this is profit taking again. This is not him looking for value. This is not him waiting for a specific amount of time to pass or just to see what happens over a course of time. These options still have 79 DTE. And he just opted to start scaling out. That's exactly what that tells me. Same amount of shares so far. That's the 27th, 28th. Total gain here, 18, 5, 7, 5, 0, 0, 8, 6, 3, hash, 13. It looks like exactly the same as this.

He's leaving the majority of capital in the account, but he's taking like 10,000, 20,000. He's taking little bits of money out. Here, he took 15,000, which again, that's super clear to see. Here, again, like another 10,000. So he's taking normal amounts of regular people money out of these accounts. And now, so he's still holding... Holding 516 April 12 calls. And this is after another day's pass of 78 DTE. And then 29 Jan is the last one here. This is the same thing. 28... Oh, I fucked this data. This is 28 Jan, 21. And then this is 29 Jan, 21. Okay.

That's another thing that I think is important to know actually now that you mention it. Is the fact that I... People think, seem to think that he's like running covered calls a lot. I don't actually see that. I see essentially no evidence that he runs covered calls at all. But that doesn't mean that he doesn't. It just means that I don't really see it. So yeah. Cool. Well, we got through January of 2021. And our next one will be the first of Feb. I'm going to take a pause though on this part of things so that we can start taking a look at. Just some current date stuff if you guys want or any other like. I'm going to take a look at the series or thesis that we want to take a look at.

So January 2021. So I'm going to take a look at the first of a few themes. The first theme that I noticed is that. Some well not even some one specific one particular. One particular. The options trade. Exiting in the money and keeping out of the money. Didn't make sense. But ended up. Working out of lucky price movement. Meading. Two days. Expiration. Pam says tell Newton that his hair is glorious. Okay. Pam says your hair is glorious. And. Okay. This is that previously, I can see a habit, so I can see some habit of profit taking, where options have longer timeframes remaining, but he takes either full or partial exits. I can also see there are several instances of smaller amounts of money, so around 10k, being withdrawn from the account a few times per month. What else do we see? Dark Mark says that the chat says hello. And what else do I see? The other thing I noticed is that he does hold large cash positions for a little bit longer than I would",

Because yesterday, I'm selecting yesterday. And it's showing me the 19th. And it's showing today is the what. What the hell is going on right now. I'm just going to kill this one. And then let's grab a new one. And let's see if we can fix this. So GME let's take a look at. The 20th and see if that filter. Okay, so that filter worked. Okay, great. Here we go. All right, so we're back at it. So here's the 20th. This filtered correctly. So that's good. So now let's take a look at. You told me it was. 10 June. Let's go to 10 June. Okay, great. This is good. So I can see. This let's sort it by size. And see if his order went through. Because his order was. 36, 847. So it looks like his order. If it went through. So it's going to be. So it looks like his order. If it went through the dark pool, it was broken up. It didn't go through as a solid order. That's the date that it went through, right?",

Okay. 9 June 2023. Okay. And 253,000 shares. So yeah, here it got broken up as well. Not a solid. Not a solid transaction. So the only reason why this really matters is the fact that it's not like a solid transaction means we can't clearly delineate when they've happened is what it boils down to. So yeah, it's limited efficacy to tell whether it went through dark pool or let exchange. But again, remember, if it goes through a dark pool, it's still like if it's reported here, this isn't an internalized order. It's why we can see it. So the fact that we can see it tells me it's not internalized and it tells me this is still hitting the consolidated tape, right? Because that's another thing is I see people mix up what this volume thing means. That volume is cumulative. So you'll see if you sort by time and go down, the volume is always going to be less.

The volume is 62 million. So I see a lot of people kind of confused by that. But that's the volume that you see here and the trades that you see here are going to hit the consolidated tape. That's why they're here. But the nature of a dark pool is that they're slightly delayed. That's the only reason why they exist is to try to prevent front running.

I think most people confuse dark pool orders with internalized orders, which are very different. Internalized orders do not hit the consolidated tape. However, an internalized order at some point would have already hit the tape because of the original transaction that occurred. Now it doesn't help with any sort of sense of market efficiency, transparent markets at all. So that's the problem with internalized orders is that we're not seeing updated transactions there. So when we're looking at this, this is all stuff that still eventually hits the consolidated tape. That Lauren says on Friday, a lot of volume came in pre and after hours. Is that why? Partially, it's because a lot of larger institutions will access the market during pre and post trading hours. It's because there's also a tendency for larger trades to come in towards the beginning of the day and towards the end of the day. You'll find this almost any single day that you look at the market where if we do, let's do like a five day, five minute chart, if you take a look at the volume mid day, pretty much every day, even here where volume was really high on a relative basis, you'll still see volume slump towards the middle of the day.

That's just very, very normal to see volume towards the beginning and the end of the day. There's nothing really remarkable about that. That's just standard market activity. That's why professional traders like myself, most of my transactions are done towards the end of the day. I don't trade a ton intraday. I'll trade zero DTEs and stuff like that. Intraday or during more non-normal portions of the day, but even as a professional retail trader, I'm still trading at a size that doesn't really matter. I don't need a ton of liquidity to do most of what I do. Vladimir says, funds rebalance on Friday. Yeah, well, it's rebalancing. It was also triple-witching, but the problem is with stuff like triple-witching, it happens so frequently now that it's really not that big a deal. People I think it still matters to a degree, but it's not as big of a deal as it used to be because triple-witching or what used to be quad-witching, which essentially has gone away and is consolidated into triple-witching now, is there's so many explorations now that it really",

I love getting into the trades for Roryn Kitty. The last thing I wanted to talk to you guys about actually is I don't know if you are familiar with the dude named Peruvian Bull. I think that's his name on Twitter, if I'm not mistaken. I think that's the name on Twitter. And so he and I, we're going to do a live session, I think probably next Thursday is the current game plan. So I don't know if there's anything in particular that you think we should cover or I should bring up with him, but the game plan is, I don't know him. So the game plan is just to bullshit with him a little bit, understand some of his background, and then to hopefully talk a little bit about just game stop from his perspective, what he's seen, and then kind of analyze what's going on in game stop together. But I think the game plan",

    "text": "is just to bullshit with him a little bit, understand some of his background, and then to hopefully talk a little bit about just game stop from his perspective, what he's seen, and then kind of analyze what's going on in game stop together. But I think the game plan is to do that on a live stream. I think so. It might be a recorded podcast that goes out, I'm undecided yet, but yeah, we'll see, we'll see exactly how it gets structured, but the plan is to do that, like I said, next week. So if there's anything that you think would be good for us to talk about or cover, just let me know. And then I can add it to an agenda, because that's the hope is to start just exploring the whole thing from different angles. I'm going to have Dave Lauer back on my podcast. I do like a monthly podcast for urban finance with them, but I'll have Dave Lauer on my podcast. I think next week or the week after. So we'll talk a little bit about market structure, kind of some of the anomalies of something like game stop and stuff like that. So that is the game plan. As always, absolute blast hanging out. Let me know if there's anything that we should take a look at. Be an outlier or an ape or both. I'll see you all later.",
