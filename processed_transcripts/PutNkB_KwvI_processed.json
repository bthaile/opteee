So there's no exercise here. He didn't add any more options. He simply took more cash in any exited essentially with 1 DTE. So he exited the 20s, the 15 Jan, 21s, the 20 DTE.

Recent news, recent tin foil so we can spend a little more time on like recent stuff. We'll just spend the first part doing this. 21 because this is. I find this stuff interesting, but I also imagine some of you might not find it quite as enthralling. But I still do want to make sure that we get through all of this, even if it takes a little while. I think it's really important. So the total gain is. 3932 750.43. I missed a penny there. 43. And then. Cash. 26.00479.97. This looks like it matches. So I think that this is just a. Rounding issue that's okay. And then we're holding. The 16 April. 21. I just do 16 April. 12 calls. And. Now the expiration for these is 16 April. 21. And then today's 19 Jan. 21. These are 87 DTE. Okay. No change in shares. And still sitting on. Interesting. Still sitting on. Man,",

I want to zoom it in so that it's like just a month. So the 25th. It started popping up. Massively. So this looks like him taking profits. This is like the first time I've gotten a glimpse of him doing something that looks like taking profits. So this is a really interesting. Which is really interesting because if I look at this from a timing perspective. I again from like a standard trading line of thought. This is not at all where I would take profits personally. And it's because it's like it's been trending sideways for a while. And then it starts really exploding up. I mean to me this looks like exactly where I wouldn't want to take profits. And the option still have over 80 days to expiration. So just yet another really, really interesting thing. Roincletty says getting up to 2.6 million wasn't taking profits. It not the same.

Because in this case, it's very clear that these still had plenty of time left. And he's taking some value off the table. Then we have this example with the 10s and the 20s, which is not about taking profit at all. That's very clear because he holds them all the way in almost to 10 DTE. For the 10s and he takes those down again, which doesn't make sense. So. This one is very confusing to me. Then he holds the 20s essentially up until 1 DTE, which also is not profit taking. In that case, his hand is forced by time. So here when he's managing further out in time, I consider that profit taking. Because it's being done when the options aren't expiring. There's plenty of time left. That's also what I notice here is that there is still plenty of time left in these options. But the fact that he's choosing to take profits there tells me that it's based on something resembling to profit. It's not being based on time.

Well, they were gone. 13. They were here. Yeah, definitely. So he those are at 31 40. Yeah, so he would have made over a million dollars on those calls. Here. So definitely he ended up getting at the very and again, like this is this is the stuff that I'm talking about. I personally do not view this as some sort of like really great timing. In this case, he got really lucky with respect to the pop happening when it did to drive the profit that much. Because again, like if you go back to 11 Jan, his total gain was 122,000.

So what I can tell you is that Rory and Kitty at this point, he was these were going to be whatever they were going to be. Either he was going to take them in and he was going to lose this amount of money, which he didn't care about. Obviously, or they were going to be something he wanted to take down. And that's why he chose to not take it into expiration, but take it down before expiration is because they had perceivably made enough that he cared enough. And he would have taken them down either the well, not the 13th. Because I think you guys have told me he posts these after the market closed. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, in this case, in this case, it is without a doubt, just magical dose of luck that led to that kind of pop in that time frame, which is incredible.

That's all. At least that's the way I look at it. That's not to say, again, that there's not. Some element of skill, obviously, there's an element of skill, but the problem is is with this specific scenario, it was within a couple days of expiration and he essentially had a 10th of what these ended up showing.

Of a lot of me, says, January 27 was the day that the buy button was turned off for Robinhood users. Got it. Yeah. So what this tells me is that he's scaling out. Like he's absolutely scaling out. I can watch it real time. So he first started scaling out on the 25th. Then on the 27th, he started scaling out more. But it was a relatively light scale out. And then he kept the shares. And he kept still 500 of those contracts. But again, this tells me very much that this is profit taking again. This is not him looking for value. This is not him waiting for a specific amount of time to pass or just to see what happens over a course of time. These options still have 79 DTE. And he just opted to start scaling out.

He's taking little bits of money out. Here he took 15,000, which again, that's super clear to see. Here again, like another 10,000.

That's another thing that I think is important to know actually now that you mention it. Is the fact that I... People think, seem to think that he's like running covered calls a lot. I don't actually see that. I see essentially no evidence that he runs covered calls at all. But that doesn't mean that he doesn't, it just means that I don't really see it. So yeah, cool. Well, we got through January of 2021. And our next one will be the first to Feb. I'm going to take a pause though on this part of things. So that we can start taking a look at. Just some current date stuff if you guys want or any other like theories or thesis that we want to take a look at. And then we'll obviously pick back up with this next week. But I did tell Newton that I would give him an update. So I'm going to text him really quick. All right. So ran through what should I tell Newton the main things I noticed are running through January. So January 2021. I noticed a few themes.",

The first theme that I noticed is that some well, not even some one specific one particular one particular. Options trade. Exiting in the money and keeping out of the money. Didn't make sense. But ended up working out of lucky price movement. And then I'm going to start reading two days into expiration. Pam says tell Newton that his hair is glorious. Okay. Pam says your hair is glorious. Okay. The other thing I noticed is that previously. I can see a habit. So I can see. I can see some habit of profit taking. I can see that. I can see that. Options have longer time frames remaining. But he takes either full or partial exits. Well, how can graphs be easier describing optical problems? Imagine a killer of an molecular amounts of money with money to a round like 10K, 10 K.

That's my report to our friend Newton. I'm going to grab a replacement sparkling water super fast and then we will dive in.

The only reason why this really matters is the fact that it's not like a solid transaction means we can't. Clearly delineate when they've happened is what it boils down to. So. Yeah. It's limited efficacy to tell whether it went through dark pool or let exchange. But again, remember, if it goes through a dark pool, it's still like if it's reported here, this isn't an internalized order. It's why we can see it. So the fact that we can see it tells me it's not internalized and it tells me this is still hitting the consolidated tape, right? Because that's another thing is I see people mix up what this volume thing means. That volume is cumulative. So you'll see if you sort by time and go down, the volume is always going to be less. And then as you go up, it's always going to be higher. And then the volume that you see here is going to match if we look at it on a chart. So if we go to, for example, we'll use the most",

That's doing the weird thing again, but whatever, go to today and you can see that the volume here is 62 million, right? So that's telling me that the volume for GameStop over the day was 62 million or whatever at the point that that came in. If I look at the volume here, the volume is 61, 61,919,000. The volume is 62 million. So I see a lot of people kind of confused by that, but that's the volume that you see here and the trades that you see here are going to hit the consolidated tape. That's why they're here. But the nature of a dark pool is that they're slightly delayed. That's the only reason why they exist is to try to prevent front running, but it's not the name is way more nefarious than what they actually are. I think most people confuse dark pool orders with internalized orders, which are very different. Internalized orders do not hit the consolidated tape. However, an internalized order at some point would have already hit the tape because of the original transaction that occurred. Now it doesn't help with any sort of",

So when we're looking at this, this is all stuff that still eventually hits the consolidated tape. What Lauren says on Friday, a lot of volume came in pre and after hours. Is that why partially it's because a lot of larger institutions will access the market during pre and post trading hours. It's because there's also a tendency for larger trades to come in towards the beginning of the day and towards the end of the day. You'll find this almost any single day that you look at the market where if we do, let's do like a five day, five minute chart. If you take a look at the volume mid day, pretty much every day, even here where volume was really high on a relative basis, you'll still see volume slump towards the middle of the day. This is very, very common. Now, there's always anomalies, right? So volume spiked up for this a little bit, but then still came down.

There's nothing really remarkable about that. That's just standard market activity. That's why professional traders like myself, most of my transactions are done towards the end of the day. I don't trade a ton intraday. I'll trade zero DTEs and stuff like that. Intraday during more non-normal portions of the day, but even as a professional retail trader, I'm still trading at a size that doesn't really matter. I don't need a ton of liquidity to do most of what I do. So yeah. Vladimir says, funds rebalance on Friday. Yeah, well, it's rebalancing. It was also triple-witching, but the problem is with stuff like triple-witching, it happens so frequently now that it's really not that big a deal. People I think it still matters to a degree, but it's not as big of a deal as it used to be because triple-witching or what used to be quad-witching, which essentially has gone away and is consolidated into triple-witching now, is there's so many explorations now that it really is, I don't want to call it superfluous.

I love getting into the trades for Rory and Kitty. The last thing I wanted to talk to you guys about actually is I don't know if you are familiar with the dude named Peruvian Bull. I think that's his name on Twitter, if I'm not mistaken. I think that's the name on Twitter. And so he and I, we're going to do a live session, I think probably next Thursday is the current game plan. So I don't know if there's anything in particular that you think we should cover or I should, you know, bring up with him, but the game plan is I don't know him. So the game plan is just to bullshit with him a little bit, understand some of his background. And then to hopefully talk a little bit about just game stop from his perspective, what he's seen and then kind of analyze what's going on in game stop together.

So if there's anything that you think would be good for us to talk about or cover, just let me know. And then I can add it to an agenda because that's the hope is to start just exploring the whole thing from different angles. I'm going to have Dave Lauer back on my podcast. I do like a monthly podcast for urban finance with them, but I'll have Dave Lauer on my podcast. I think next week or the week after. So we'll talk a little bit about market structure, kind of some of the anomalies of something like game stop and stuff like that. So that is the game plan. As always, absolute blast hanging out.
