The old schedule that'll get everybody. 5H, great to see you. Okay. So let's talk a little bit about the agenda. As you can tell, I have two case studies of recent trades that I want to go through. I have a conversation that I was having in the discord with the member. I've plotted out their name just in case they don't want to blast it on YouTube for everybody. So if you're on here and you want to talk directly happy to, but if you'd rather keep that offline, more than happy to do that, I just want to talk about some of the concepts behind the dialogue that we had. Then I want to walk through a little bit more of the AMA questions that I got for last week that I didn't get to. And before all of that, one of the things I want to start doing on these beginner trading sessions is recapping the markets. Not from me, from you. So to start us off, I would love everybody that's watching and able to throw into the chat one thing that you saw this week. Can be something interesting. Can be something you didn't understand. It can be something that was",

Can be something interesting. Can be something you didn't understand. It can be something that was a first for you. It could be something that you thought was going to happen and happened. It could be literally anything related to the markets. The reason why I want to start this process is because one of my underlying assumptions is I would guess most of you may not have a specific cycle or habit. To reconcile what happened in the market on a daily basis. If I had to guess a lot of people will go through the look at the markets every day, which is awesome. But my guess is we're not we're not taking the time to synthesize what happened and kind of acknowledge what happened for our minds to cling onto. Because there's a ton of learning that happens when we very meaningfully go through and review what happened in the military we call it an AR after action review. Or report if you're writing it like an officer does, which is super annoying. They're not fun. But it's the the process of analyzing things, but very purposefully. So let's see.

We have Jimmy saying GME going down down and down sort of. I mean, I did a video right before this looking at GameStop and it actually didn't it didn't create her too far. I think it's when I look at GME, I actually view this as running sideways consolidating. So maybe that's a good first starting point for us, right? Because when I think about GME going down, I would think of GME approaching near term lows. And I'm sure some of what you're saying is just ingest, right? That it's not necessarily going the direction we want, which I totally get here for here for that. But just to again, clarify, I actually don't think GME is going through in this case right now. It looks like it's actually consolidating pretty well. Now to your broader point, if this does start rotating over, that does start looking like downside to me. Now, if we think about analyzing a chart, again, I'm going to use these as learning experiences for everybody. If we're analyzing a chart, what's one of the first things we can do to identify if something is in an uptrend, downtrend consolidation? And you'll notice that within this single chart, depending on the aggregation period, you'll notice actually all of those. But what do we look for? There's a",

And you'll notice that within this single chart, depending on the aggregation period, you'll notice actually all of those. But what do we look for? There's a couple very simple things. Actually, yeah, let me caveat that question with I want the most simple variations you can think of. I'm not looking to be super complex. Riz says linear regression channel sloping, that's great. So these are standard deviation channels, but linear regression channel, standard deviation channels either or totally cool. I think both of those are correct. That's actually one of the beautiful parts about these broader statistical measures of price movement is that it inherently gives you a trend, right? Straight up. So first, good. Anything else? Coming to an apex. Okay, I like that. Let's talk about that. If I were to classify the primary indicators of a general trend, linear regression channel, standard deviation channels, either of those immediately shows it to you. Literally, it makes it undeniable what it is. I can see it based on the slope of these lines. What's even more important to me to determine trend is the relative position of highs and lows. Sometimes I'll call them terms. Sometimes I'll call them swing. It's because I'm lazy. I use them interchangeably. But let's take a look. We have a high here. Then we go down, down, down,",

We have a higher low here. Then we go up, up, up, up, up. Then we have a high. What do you notice about this high compared to the other high that I showed you? Jesse is already all over it. So we're relaxed. What can Amazon do? It's lower. That's exactly correct. Right? So we have a high, a lower high, a lower high. From the low's perspective, we have a low, higher low, lower low. So one of the things that you should identify here is that it very rarely is a clean picture. It very rarely is this beautiful, higher highs, lower lows stacked without ever having, again, higher lows that then turn into lower lows. Right? So when we're talking about the world of analyzing technical analysis and the price movement of things, context is so important. So that's why we tend to use multiple indicators. We use other things to help us understand context, to which Lauren says, UG. Lauren, why UG? Feel like that's fair. Don't agree? Or we don't like that. But that is the",

It's one of the easiest ways to determine trends. So next, let's take a look at another thing. Well first, what time frame is this? What time frame are we looking at? Up here, three month daily. So what will we call that time frame? Is that a long time, a short time, a medium time? Why do we think about something like a three month chart? What do we think? Jimmy says, learn something new from all your videos. Good. That's what I love. That's exactly the goal. Especially for this video, I specifically spent a lot of time trying to teach concepts in the Friday session. So that's fantastic to hear. Joey says depends on the trade. It doesn't actually. It's a good guess, but it actually doesn't depend on the trade at all. Time is objective, right? Like one day is objectively one day. Now I understand your concept regarding the thesis of the trade and the way that you choose to trade that could be a long term time frame or a short term time frame. 100 completely agree",

But if we're thinking of this in the context of exactly, so Jotato is exactly on the money for what I'm highlighting here with respect to the duration. Think of it this way. Think of the weather, right? So if I today, Southern California, it was a little San Diego. So it was a little, we had a little bit of marine layer coming in towards the end of the day. It was like low 70s, high 60s, sunny. There was a little bit of a breeze. So I don't know, maybe just Californians might have found a little cold. I throw that out there because we're just trying to get by here, right? And Southern California, it's, we're just one day at a time. It's very difficult for us. So while we're going through our very challenging high 60s, low 70s, moderately cloudy weather, if I am to analyze what is, what's a higher probability play for the weather tomorrow, if I need to guess what it is, what I look at the weather today, what I look at the weather six months ago, any guesses? It's pretty self-explanatory, right? The best predictor of the weather tomorrow",

It's pretty self-explanatory, right? The best predictor of the weather tomorrow is the weather today. So what I'm looking at with respect to a chart is that as you add time, the susceptibility to new factors, a new market, new market movement enters the equation. Now I have to be abundantly clear because I do not what, again, I find this all the time with people is that they take the inverse of what I'm saying, which is a, it's a common logical fault that people have. I'm not suggesting that short term timeframes are more predictable in the sense that a lot of people interpret that to mean. In a really short term time frame, it's a fucking crap shoot if something goes up or down. It's a crap shoot. I'm not suggesting that short term timeframes are predictable to that degree. What I'm highlighting is that if I were to analyze the expected price performance of GameStop on Monday when the market opens, my guess is that it's going to be something around here that we'll see. Whether it's up or down, I do not know how far in this range, it goes up or down. I also do not know. Now as we think about the probability of",

Okay, that's time for things to change things to happen. Now if we think about if it's a trading week, the difference between day to day, it's much less, right? It's less than 24 hours that we can experience new information coming into change things. It's a lower window for new material information to enter the equation. As we stack more and more time, we stack bigger and bigger windows for new information to enter the equation. This is exactly why when we look at stuff like a probability comb, let's take a look at this probability comb. What do you notice? Don't worry about the teardrop function of it. You can ignore that for now. What do you notice about the shape of this teardrop comb? It's not a teardrop comb, by the way. I'm just trying to make it more accessible to people. This is a parabola.

What do you notice about how this looks? Wider. Jesse's on it. What do you notice about the expected high range? As we add duration to things, we add time for new things to enter into the pricing models and then to move price. The way that we look at something like a three month chart, now from, again, to Joey's earlier point, for your perspective as a trader, that could feel like a really long time. If you're an intraday trader, three months can feel like an eternity. Or if you're an investor, three months doesn't even register on your fucking radar. It doesn't matter. You move in years, not months. So there's a relative component based on the style of the trader.

So if I take a look at 90 days here, I can tell you the expected range over a 90 day period within one standard deviation. If I do the probability of a touch over 90 days, we're looking at a within a one standard deviation move, we're looking at 37 to 10 and 3 quarters. If I look at that over a one week move, we're looking at 25, which is 12 points lower to 17, just seven points higher. That is objectively a massive difference. So in this time frame, there's the probability for way more information to answer the equation thus moving price. So three months is actually a moderate length of time, right? As we look at, if we plotted the changes day over day, you'll notice that the relationship is somewhat linear, but not purely. So there will be periods where over a five day period, that's from 50 to 60 days, there might be a slightly different change in the overall price range expectation than a shorter five day period, but in a total of 10 day period, right?

If I think about trading something like a momentum strategy, I can tell you from a quantitative perspective, I know this objectively to be true because I've studied it. I know that prices, stocks that are experiencing larger 52-week price movements are more likely to exhibit continuation of that price movement over the next month than to something that has a high three-month price movement. That matters to me a lot. That information is going to tell me a lot. It's going to tell me based on the profit mechanism momentum, I now need to understand the traits, how it behaves, the way it works. You all have already seen this and you all know that I'm always happy to bring out my abomination of a slide deck. I literally just added more to this by the way. So it really is becoming like this gross abomination. But you already know about the big four strategy process that's literally what I'm describing right now. So the way that all of this comes back into time frames is because when I look at something like a profit mechanism that I'm trying to extract, I need to figure out what time frames are most suitable one for the profit mechanism itself, but then also to analyze the presence of it and the corresponding indicators. So that is the",

So that is the starting point here. So literally all of that came off of one person's singular observation. But as you know, I'm always happy to go down rabbit holes. But let me go back up. I want to grab a couple others that you all saw. I see Reese says oil rallied, oil did rally. That's a good observation. Let's talk about the rally and oil really fast. That's actually one of the things we're going to talk about today because I have a trade in here that is going to be one of the case study trades. But what about oil? What do we see here? Like what's going on here? Does anybody know the context behind oil's move? Now I want to be clear. The context behind oil's move doesn't actually matter that much. The reason why I'm looking up by the way is I have a screen up here. I'm just looking at futures. War that's a big part of it. So when Iran and Israel started kicking off with one another, it definitely moved oil. But it already started to base here. So that was a massive catalyst. But then what? We have to go further.

So then when we're trading something, there's a reason for this rabbit hole by the way. So if we're trading something like this. When we're trying to chart out the movement of something, what our price targets are, how we think something might behave. Those details matter quite a lot actually in my opinion. So when we think about identifying the origin of the move, the catalyst here, being war, big initial catalyst, then we have to click in a few layers to understand how pervasive is the catalyst, how much of this does, how much of this comes down to Saudi and OPEC essentially releasing too much oil in the beginning, start driving price down because they miscalculated. How long does that last? Those kinds of details can be baked into a strategy. Now I want to be also very, very clear. You don't even need to know any of that to trade a movement. You don't need to know any of it. So the reason why I'm giving you these two different scenarios is because it's up to you as a trader to",

And then I see other people that probably understand something better than I do. And they still won't make the fucking trade because they want to look at it even more, right? It's completely personality dependent and it's hilarious to me how varied it is. But going back to and tying this back to the first component we were discussing, if I wanted to come up with a six month thesis for crude oil, if for whatever reason, I'm looking for a six month thesis. How much research would I probably have to do compared to if I'm just trading this recent surge and fully expect to just get out when it reverses?

Reese says almost none versus all the time in the world, fair. Jesse says you'd be looking at price action and volume over macro news. Jotato says you can look at a chart instantly compared to the history of barrel prices seems a bit extensive. So there's a bunch of different ways to look at it. But what I can tell you, unequivocally, is that no matter what you do, there's going to be more analysis tied to a six month thesis compared to the amount of analysis that we need to do to trade the momentum of something over a short term duration. Now this is a very interesting kind of trade. Thor looks so disenfranchised. I brought him to the vet today.

So back to this and the idea of aligning thesis with profit mechanism with strategy. The summary of this section so far before we go into the trades and all this stuff will do that in a little bit. But when I take a look at the longer term price movement, you'll notice that this actually is kind of bucking the trend, right? So for me, if you're trading something via a breakout strategy, this clearly isn't the continuation of something because over the last year, oil has been coming down pretty hard. So we'll talk about the trade itself in a little bit, but I want you to start thinking more carefully about the amount of research that's being done. And then the corresponding trade period that aligns with that. And it's I guess I should actually reverse that right? The trade period then the corresponding amount of research because if",

I want to hold it for long, not sure if I'd have time to initiate a covered call. Well, if it's a long term holding, then it doesn't really matter, right? Like the nature of investing and like buy and hold stuff for long term durations like multi year periods, that's based way more on the expectation of the company to grow. That's like essentially what it boils down to. If you're holding for something greater than a year, that's your trade thesis. Is you think the company is going to grow? That's the only reason why the stock price would go up in that time frame. It's the only thing that ultimately matters in that circumstance is price go up. So in that scenario, if it's a long term holding, then the way I would look at it is they doesn't actually matter that much.

So it's a good, like it's a good differentiation, I suppose, but at least from my perspective, long term holdings are based so much more on fundamental components, not saying that you have to go in and do what most people think about with respect to fundamental analysis. You don't have to, in my opinion, you don't have to sit there and go through and analyze all of the financial statements and stuff like that. You could do that. You could choose to make your own discounted cash flow model. You could do all that if you were so inclined. But I don't think there's an imperative to what I think is it comes down to just a very high level. Do I think this thing is going to be worth more in the future than it is today? That's how I would think about that. Sam says, the premiums are good for CSP, but again, middle of trend, would you initiate a CSP?

Because you're telling me the thing I can tell you is that it's not, I already see misalignment, right? So you're saying, I want to hold it for long. Okay. So then if you want to hold it for long, then what are we doing? If you are worried about this short term trend because you want to hold it for long, then do you actually want to hold it for long? My guess is probably not if that doesn't align. So I think in your case, the first thing actually would be reconciling those components. Because I don't think that those two ideas align at least from like a general analysis lens. Just don't see it makes sense there. You want to hold it for long? Then I would hold it. If I don't want to hold it for long because I'm nervous about this short term trend, then don't hold it. So Reece says if a trade goes your way with the CSP, you'll never own it. Yep.

I think I might have to refresh this video at some point, that video. But that's a massive drawback of the wheel. And that's actually why I think a big part of it comes down to just literally gaining exposure to the underlying itself if you want exposure to the underlying itself. And then if you don't want exposure for whatever reason, right? Like it's in the middle of a trend. You're not convinced on what direction it's going to go. Then to me, it tells us a slightly different story. Maybe it's not time to enter until it clearly defines what way it's going for your strategy and your timeframe.

Now there's a bunch of things I want to highlight about this again from a broad perspective. This isn't to pick on anybody. This is to help people learn. So the very first thing is I noticed the first mention of crude oil in this case earlier today. So this isn't something that was based on at least from what I saw. Some sort of long term analysis that then led to a head where it's like, ah, now I have my entry. I didn't see that. So this from the origin looked like an impulse trade. It looked like crude oil was moving. We wanted to participate in the move so that we got into crude oil. That's the first thing. And I think that as an origin for a trade is a bad trade entry. So when I think about when I'm placing a trade, whether a trade is good or bad does not tie to if it's profitable or not profitable, a good trade can lose money. A bad trade can make money. What makes a trade good or bad is the",

A bad trade can make money. What makes a trade good or bad is the foundation for the trade itself. That is what is most important because if we don't do that, then we immediately over prioritize the outcome of an individual trade, which in the grand scheme of things does not matter. It does not matter. Having one trade unless it's, you know, this biggest trade of your entire life and then you never trade again. It's kind of like hitting it at the casino and then never going back. Sure. That scenario, okay. If that's the game plan, that's still a plan, but it's kind of like hitting the lot of pretty low probability. So for most of us that are trading based on systems, meaning the application of something over time, the outcome of an individual trade does not matter. It should be nearly fully deprioritized. The parts that matter the absolute most are the conditions and the strategy in how that's managed. The reason why that matters is because that's what leads to a replicable thing over time.

That's the exact opposite way that these should be done. If we wanted to trade crude oil because it was moving, cool, trade crude oil because it's moving. But we should have a defined strategy that we're using here, right? So for me, the profit mechanism for crude oil is breakout. That's again, it's literally one of the trades that I have on right now. And I guess this is a good segue to talk a little bit about that first. And then we'll talk about this CVS trade. But for crude, I entered on 30-sep and one oct. These are not my actual trade sizes. I reduce them down to the smallest component just for ease. So the trade is not this size. The trade is quite a bit larger than this as it sits now. So let's look at those two entries. 30-sep, one oct. Why those two days? Let's go to crude oil. And then let's go in to a three month. So 30-sep is right here. One oct is right here. Why these days?

It was entirely based on the risk side of the equation. Because if you'll notice, I entered four for every one that I entered on the first of oct. So the reason why I started with four here, even though this was obviously a speculative entry, was entirely because I viewed the risk worth it. I viewed it as a lower risk entry because what I care about is the downside. Not how much I think I'm going to make. I care about the risk side of the equation first. So then I say, OK, we had a little bit of a consolidation. We dipped down. We had a massively strong byday here. We had a second day where it held the same level slightly, slightly falling below the close of the prior day. But we didn't continue this downtrend yet. So when I entered here, was it in my mind that we're not going to continue this downtrend? I have some fucking looting on. I have no idea. Literally have no idea. I view it as a",

So if I see something that's been in a big downtrend, I perceive a floor at some point with something like crude oil. It's a commodity. Even if there's a lot of supply or other periods where there's a lot of demand, it's still a physical commodity that has to move. So then I say to myself, OK, and this is before I entered the trade, way before I entered the trade, I'd been watching crude for some time. So as crude fell down here, I wanted to know how far is it going to go before it starts to grab a bite. So I saw the next day I grabbed a bite. So then I was curious, OK, does it grab here and then fall? Right? Similar to this. Then grabbed, then fell. Down, down, grabbed, didn't fall. That does not mean that it couldn't fall, it just didn't here. So then I create a probabilistic guess. I say, OK, do I think it's more likely to start reversing here or my actual expectation was consolidation first? That's what I expected.

What, like 65 here? So then if I enter here with bulk size for what the exposure is that I want, and I'm perceiving an initial floor, something around here at 65, what do I think about that risk? How can I size this trade so that risk makes sense? And then can I contextualize this low? Because I'm only looking at three months. So then let me go out to six months. Where's the low? I don't see anything here. I have to go out further. Where's the low on the year? I don't see anything here. I have to go out further. Where do I see the low on three years? I see the low that generally lines up over here. So I created that initial guess on a floor. Then I had to zoom out to figure out if there's any reference point for this floor.

So I view this as essentially a three year floor. Again, does this mean crude oil can't fall through a three year floor? It can. But what I can also look at is that it didn't hear, it didn't hear, it didn't hear, and it didn't hear. So I'm okay taking the risk on that trade. As long as I size it appropriately, that is okay. This is a low risk entry for me. Then if we get the breakout, this is why I started adding to the trade on the first. It's why I didn't wait until the second, the third or the fourth. I saw this massive breakout start. So then it was time to enter with the rest of the position. And it's why I haven't added more into it because I'm at size.

Because if you're using the larger futures crude oil and stuff like that, my account size can definitely handle it. But it's not so much whether or not the account size can handle it. I am very much a scaling trader. I like to have the ability to move into and out of things.

So even as we were moving on the 30th, I was scaling in throughout the day on the 30th.

So San to let me know if that answers your question with respect to enter on the 6527. I'm not trying to bottom dip, right? Like I don't know if it's going to break down below that or not. But what I know in this instance is that it's moving that direction very strong. So I'm not going to step in front of it. That's like the very standard bargain buying approach. I want to see how it behaves around those levels. And then if it behaves, then again, in this case, I did trade this movement here because I like that move. But one of the biggest things retail traders have to get out of the habit of doing is when we have something that is going down that we get into it with a long trade while it's still going down. It's just, it doesn't make sense, right? If you think about that in a really, really simple way, it kind of is like, yeah, okay, why would I buy something if it's going down?

Two, I just rest orders. That's why for stuff like commodities and it's why even for equities, it's why I really like trading futures. Joey says they're using patterns or more so candlesticks. Neither I don't use either heavily. I use candlesticks to analyze what the movement was, but I don't care if it's bearish in golfing, bullish in golfing, like I don't really do any of those. So I look at candlesticks to help me understand what the flavor was for the day. So for example, we can look at some near term stuff to give you ideas like this here.

That's a lot of selling pressure that causes that. This is a different scenario where we have a battle where something wants to go higher enough, sellers step in. They're like, nope, too high. We'll take it down. And then the same thing to the other side. So that tells me that there's active participation from both buyers and sellers. If I see these big blocky candles like this, it tells me that it's a one sided kind of day. Joey says, what if it gaps past your resting order? Maybe I'm a little confused. Yeah, that's, that's, they trade 24 seven. So like right now it could get, they don't trade 24 seven. Sorry, that's hyperbole. They trade near 24 seven. So futures are closed right now. And then they'll open Sunday. So there could be gap risk from now to Sunday. And that's always handled via sizing the trade logically.

I don't decide that ahead of time. But for something like this, as I'm entering, I already know what I'm doing. If it goes down, I'm resting the order, hits the order, done out until it starts to behave. Then I might get back in depending on how it's moving.

So Santos says futures, not as stable for beginners, I am assuming. Yeah. If it's equity futures, then it's fine. So if you're trading something like crude oil or corn or hogs or soybeans, stuff like that has a really different nuance to it that you have to understand some of the production cycles, I think, so that you're not at a pretty significant information disadvantage.

And then I'll come out of them when I can't monitor them more closely. So for something like futures products, they offer you delta one exposure to something. And options give you leveraged exposure, but there's a lot of nuance with options. We have things like theta decay and all the Greeks that come along with non-delted one products. The derivatives in that case break out into two components. So we have options and futures. Well, there's more than that, by the way, but those are the two that most retail will be concerned with.

The highest tax rate I can have. So I lose a lot of money to taxes. So if I trade something like the indices themselves, SPX, XSP, RUT, those kinds of products, they give you section 1256 tax code, but you can't buy and hold SPX. There is no SPX to hold. It's literally just an index. So then the next best place, futures, because futures give you delta one, they give you leverage, they give you section 1256.

I negotiate everything 100 100. Joey says, do you usually, do you generally use defined resistance or percentages to stop? I essentially never use percentage. I don't care about a percentage to stop. I care about where I define support and resistance. So I have a video that I put out not too long ago. Let me see if I can find it. No. No, don't remember where it is. There's a video about risk, I think. Yeah, I think this one. There you go. So that video, it talks about essentially the process that I'll use to manage risk in trades.

What I care about is where do I think something might trade to without going through and then move back up and out. Now I have to make sure that whatever that is as defined still makes sense. So what that means is let's say for example, I wanted to enter crude oil here. But if I look at crude oils entry here, I can see that essentially it's traded below these levels, right? Very near term. So below this 67 handle here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, and here. So there's a lot of recent instances where crude dropped below that near term support. So then I have to set up wherever I would consider support to be where it is. I already walked through that whole process why I set it up about where it is around 65. So then my entry is as a completely different shape because my entry now is at 74 with the expected support down at 65 as compared to entry at 68 with expected support at 65.

So for example, this trade here, I was able to size up way more because I view near term support as it is. So it gives me essentially again, a lower risk entry. Whereas if I wait to enter until here, I can't go at the same size because if I'm using the same support level, it's a much bigger drop to get there. So they have to marry with one another so that it makes sense. It's a good question. Santo says, when you enter the order for futures, do you also enter exit orders? The ones in soft stops? Is it already like entered together? You just play it out. What kind of proportion? No. If I'm trading something soft, soft stop is not going to be entered. That's almost always a mental stop for me to review. I very often will exit on a soft stop, but yeah, that's just a mental exit.

So if I'm going to be out moving around and I wouldn't be able to monitor or get on my phone real fast, if it's triggered, then I would go in and enter it. But otherwise I would rest it. Now there is a big difference though, because if I'm resting a hard stop, I'm already giving it a lot of room to move. Essentially, the grace that I would give it somewhere else. So for example, a soft stop here for this example would look at something like below the 66. That would be a soft stop for me again, using these entry days as the example. And the reason why it's a soft stop is because I would want to see how it behaves as it penetrates below those levels. But it's gone down below those levels a couple times and is siphoned back up. So I wouldn't want to rest in order there because that becomes an unnecessary stop. So that's why a soft stop in this case is mental.

If I'm resting in order on a hard stop, then it needs to be essentially completely outside of where the acceptable range would be. James says futures are nastily the same as any equity, but you need to understand how points works so you don't get caught off guard with how fast they move in dollars. Yeah, definitely. So futures, they move in points and ticks. They don't move in dollars. So like as we look at crude oil, this technically is not 74.45 because the multiplier in something like these different futures are different. So like if we use Fortslatch, yes. This is not 57.95.50. The first thing you'll notice that it only moves in 25 tick increments. So the only price that this can be is 95.50, 95.75, 95.25, so on and so forth. It can't be 95.55. It doesn't move in that increment. So the tick is the smallest size that it'll move. In this case, it's 25.0.25. You can call it 25.00 if that's just easier to wrap the head around. But the",

You can call it 25.00 if that's just easier to wrap the head around. But the value of that tick is different. So every time that this moves, this 95.50, if this goes from 95.50 to 95.75, that represents one tick, which is 0.25, that's the move. But the value of that is 12.50. So if this moves by that quarter, the PL moves by 12.50. So essentially, it's just like anything else with options, how you have to remember to like move the decimal and stuff, you just do the same show with futures. You can have like a reference for yourself that's easy to look at until you memorize most of the stuff that you're trading. But yeah, that's exactly how it works. It's not linear. I, the futures markets are fascinating because I genuinely, I feel like the financial systems very often are set up like to make it more difficult to enter. I really do believe that. It's like, why the fuck does it have to be this confusing? I don't see like a big value. Corey says, what's your strategy when taking profit? Do you have profit targets when you enter a trader's assessors? You go both. You both. The reason is the way that I manage profits in a trade",

You go both. You both. The reason is the way that I manage profits in a trade depends entirely on these details. It matters entirely on what the strategy is built around and then how I trade that strategy. So for example, if I'm trading something like short puts, I have a different rule set that I'll follow in terms of taking profits as compared to if I'm trading something like ratio called diagonals. They're very, very different in terms of how they behave, how they work. So for example, if we have a ticker, I'm going to go into scan, I'm going to pick a random ticker. I just want to look at something I don't look at a lot. Perfect. Quad Cs. This looks interesting to the downside. This would be, I'm setting a couple alerts because this actually looks interesting to the downside. So let's just say I wanted to sell puts in here. I don't, but let's use it as an example again. I just want to look at something I don't look at a lot. So let's say that actually let's go into paper trading and then let's go back here. So we're going to trade a favorable period in here.

Cory says, what the fuck are those volume nodes? It's exactly it. They're volume nodes. So volume profile essentially plots where things trade at price levels. So it essentially takes all of the volume that you see down here. It turns it on its side and it doesn't care anymore. It's not based on a time series. So it's not based on date. The volume here is based simply at where it's transacted at. So let's, oh, I see what you mean, sorry. You're asking like what, what were the, I see, sorry. I thought you were asking like what the, what the indicator was, my bad. Okay, cool. Yeah. So this is all loaded up. We can look. I want this a little higher. We guys think this is 49 and a half.

And let's take a look at the perfect, the 36 DTE. Now, for me, I literally have a matrix set up based on DTE, Dazed expiration from entry. So I also track DIT, Dazed and Trade. And I created a matrix based on a broad data set that I manage. And I literally just look at it as it's kind of like a, directions at this point. And the way it works is based on whatever DTE I have via entry. So this case, 30, 60, is the entry. Based on X numbers of days in trade, I then accept different amounts of percent max gain because these are, again, defined profit. The way I manage a defined profit trade is completely different than the way that I would manage undefined profit. Because, again, let's take a look at this example. So this is 36 days to go.

And then before expiration, it would look like this. So then as time passes, this line approximates to that line. That's what that tells us. Okay, so now let's go back to the example that my artwork is complete. I think it's, I feel like that's really well drawn personally. I'll just take credit for it. And we have this trade on now. And let's fast forward time. Let's put on another trade while we're at it just for an example. 64 DT, oh, that's a good question. Let's pretend we're bullish. Let's not worry about if we actually are not. Let's pretend we're bullish. What expiration do we choose here? 64 55. Also fun fact, I just got the new iPhone. And so far it's good, I like it.

All right, so for this, for me, it's between these two. 64 and 155, I actually would prefer something around like 90. That's been my go to as of late, bringing it further and further in time, just as markets move. So we'll grab this 64 for now because theta on them is so light anyways because it's so cheap. We can go deep in the money here. And we'll just pretend that we buy one. Oh, that shows up. But that doesn't what a hater, what a hater. That's kind of fun. I know it's all squiggly too. All right, let's fast forward time. Let's go forward two days for the example. So it starts moving up as expected. So in our scenario, we started entering here, I think. I think we picked one of these days and it's starting to move up. Now, let's take a look at the options, specifically. What we sold. Here's the option that we sold. So move a couple days.

That happens sometimes because of volatility. But then let's fast forward a few more days. We go forward four more days. What it does. So now we have 28 DTE on our short puts. Let's see what they're trading for now. We're just working through the good old free buffering. There it goes. So now they're worth even more, which is super annoying. But we've had a couple of down days. This is just telling us volatility is expanding. That's exactly why that's happening. So it's an interesting example. But if we take a look at the call side though, those are making money. So the calls we paid 2.5. And they're up 32 bucks right now. So that's pretty that's pretty fun. Now let's move time forward a bit more. I'm going to go with a bigger adjustment. We'll go to like the 30th maybe. Did I fuck the date up? I thought it had like this big rally. What is this 26?

This will go way faster. Nine July is right here. What I'm trying to show you is that depending on how the underlying is moving, that should and will inform what makes sense in terms of profit taking. So this goes all the way back to Corey's question. It's just slow going as it sits now. Let's see what this loads us in that. And then I'll be able to fast forward it way more. Okay. So now this has 16 augs of 38 days in 101. So something like that. Again, we're just going to pretend that these are liquid. So looking at these, we would sell them for 25 cents. And it is a 38 day trade. So let's analyze that. I'm going to kill these other ones super fast just to keep the example simple. And then let's fast forward now to like the 18th.

Like as you hear me kind of loosely talking about this concept. What do you what do you expect? Any good scientist should have some ideas hypothesis as it were about what you might expect to see from an experiment, which is what we're doing we're experimenting right now. So what do you expect? Perfect. So let's do this 51 DTE. This is ideal. And this is great. So let's say we sell these 170s. Perfect. We get 510. 51 DTE. 51 DTE. We're going to sell the 170s. At 510. Cool. I had a cook dinner and I got lost so I'm not expected shit that's perfect. It's like a jack in the box. You'll just expect a surprise then.

Now we also know that our PNL increases like this. As the stock price moves this way. Right. So if current price in this case I didn't even look at what Tesla was in the example. I have no idea. But let's pretend that now. When we get this next view. It will be here. So do you notice how the PNL from your short put is not just the passage of time. But if you get an accommodating price move like this. You can realize more money faster. So then we have to think about the logistics of this so is at 170 and stock was at 193.

And the reason why I'm asking this is because this concept is so important. And this concept that we're going through from a premium selling perspective is exactly why the idea of profits profit. Or you don't go broke taking profits. Doesn't make sense in trading. It literally doesn't make sense in trading. It's a terrible adage that does not relate well to trading. It's completely broken. Okay. So Lauren says that she's on target with us. Okay. So now. Let's take a look at our position. It's worth one seventeen and it's three July. So we now have 44 DTE. 44 DTE. The same position is now at one seventeen. So what do we think? What's happened here? Well,",

And before I show you how to do the math, you tell me what math do you think we should do. Again, this is a hopefully an interactive learning experience versus dictatorial. So I want the brains working. So we fast forwarded time. Right. So that's pretty easy. And in this case, we literally just went about a week. So this to this is the passage of one week, seven days. So I'm actually going to move that down here. So this is seven days in trade. DIT. Joey asked what's the intrinsic value of the option? There is none. So now. In this case, we're seven days in the trade. Our option is going to be showing a profit. So we have five, ten, less the one seventeen, three ninety three. So we have one seventeen left to go. We have three ninety three in the bag. So in this case, this is one seventeen. This is three ninety three.

Okay. So actually, this is perfect time for a poll. Because I already see different answers. So let's take a look at our Tesla trade, Tesla trade. 44. We have seven DIT. Seven days in trade. We made one seventeen. No, we have one seventeen remaining. Made three ninety three. Seven days in trade of 51 DTE. Take a trade down. Let trade go. And for this case, it's a one lot. So there is no take some profit. I'm just removing that for simplicity. There is no choice to take some of it down because we've sold one. So let's see what the answers are. I'm actually very eager to see these responses. Because from the first few, I actually already saw like some differences that I didn't expect. So right now we're 60, 40 split with five votes.

And the chat essentially identified the same disposition effect. Where we tend to like selling winning investments. Right. So the way expectation from that exercise was that the vast majority of people were going like I didn't even think it was going to be that close. I thought it was going to be almost across the board. Everybody would just say take it down. Take the money and move because that is the general impulse people would have. Now. Let's let's talk about the details here though. Originally. We stood to make five ten. We've now made three ninety three. We have one seventeen left to go. We now have forty four days left to go. So how can we. How can we conceptualize this even without a model. And understanding what's optimal. What's a way that we can conceptualize this. How can we make this make sense?

So we've already made. A good bulk of the profit. Tommy says if trading plan says. Take down at eighty on short put trading to the upside would have to wait. And what I'm working through with you now is how do we build something in a trading plan that makes sense. So in this case we're at three ninety three of five ten. So we're at seventy seven percent seventy seven point one percent max profit. Seventy seven point one percent max. So he says forty four days is a lot of time for a trade to reverse two. It is. And this is exactly why it is such a tricky prospect because I'd rather be skiing highlights the other side of that. It could keep going. Right. So then how do we analyze this? How do we come up with the response that makes logical sense because both what Joey says and I'd rather be skiing say absolutely matter.

Let's just call it a thirty delta I don't think it was I think it was a little less let's just call it a thirty delta. And then here we can take a look at the delta of the option really quick. It's a five delta. So the probability of this trade working out. Meaning probability of being out of the money is like seventy percent. Now the probability of this trade working out is like ninety five percent. So what's happened. Well, we've made a bunch of money in seven days. Right. We have three hundred ninety three dollars here that we've made in seven days. We only have one seventeen left to go. Most traders look at this and say, oh no brainer. We've made the bulk of the profit in very little time. Take the trade down, make the money and then move on to the next.

So now this one seventeen without price movement is going to be slow. Because if we think of theta now since it's further out of the money, let's take a look. If we go back to where we entered the trade for the example, which I think was the twenty-sixth. Here. It was about a week. It was a week. I mean, it is a twenty two delta. To clarify in the original point. Theta here is ten cents. So now if we go back here, what's our theta on the one seventy's? Six cents. So our theta is contracted pretty meaningfully forty percent. So per day you now make less money. Wait the conundrum. So what's the right answer? Is the right answer to take the trade down? Is the right answer? To let the trade go? So now I'm going to do the poll one more time. Okay. So now you have a couple other factors to consider. You have the factor of probability being integrated.

We already know that from what we looked at before. So we have in this case. Ten dollars a day in theta. Now we have six dollars a day in theta. Tommy is looking at a good part, a good answer. I think Tommy says maybe there's a better place for my money now. So we start. That's a consideration. We need two more votes. So we have forty six percent. We're literally split fifty fifty now. There we go. We have our sixteen votes. Thank you guys very, very much for voting. And so we have fifty six that take it down. We have forty three percent that let it go. Here's the correct answer.

We start this equation where our profit is 510. The probability of profit in this case was 88. Because I remember it was a 22 delta. And then if we're not managing the loss, let's figure out what the loss would have been. We'll just ballpark. Let's say we got in on the 16th. For the 26th, my bad. Let's say that our exit was going to be at 165. I don't think it shows the short puts. So I'm just going to have to do like this synthetic thing that I do. It's, you'll just have to bear with me for a second. So let me go back to the 26th. This is going to move up. And then essentially we have to pretend that price moves. And then I'll just adjust the option by it and figure out what the loss would be. Just take me a second. So we got into this for 5.1. And then there it goes. Okay. We got in for 5.1. And we're planning our loss. What did I say at 165. So we have it's trading at 193. We're planning",

So we got in for 5, 10 and hours would be trading somewhere closer to this. So let's call it 17. I think that that's probably fair. So this equals this minus this equals this times 100 1190.

So that Lauren says you're talking about selling puts and calls. You can pull out of those when you want 100 correct. Yep. So puts and calls any sort of those options, whether you bought or sold, you can buy or sell them any time into expiration. So definitely you can you can exit those whenever you would like. So here our expected return is really solid on the trade. It looks good. Now the problem that we run into is that if we look at the expected return, this is for an individual trade. If we change this to be the expected return of a strategy, we run into an interesting conundrum because if we start changing the probability or the the profit levels or the probability of profit, if we start changing them too much, then it can actually start decreasing our expected return potential.

Now if you're able to find other trades like this, then we're good. If not, then circumstances change. So going all the way back to the it depends comment. It depends entirely on the kinds of things you trade the short put with. If it's a naked short put, we don't want to take assignment. The way that you have to build your matrix for profit taking is not super complex, but it has to be done in the context of not decreasing your overall profitability potential and not getting to the point where we're taking profits too fast. And if we take profits too fast, then we have a smaller total profit that we take. So this can start nuking your overall expected return. So kind of a lot. The way that I would think about it to simplify to start is that you don't want to take profits too fast. If you're taking profits within 50 max profit, that sometimes can be okay. That's if you make 50 max profit on in this example of 51 DTE trade, if you make 50 max profit in a week, then you could",

That's if you make 50 max profit on in this example of 51 DTE trade, if you make 50 max profit in a week, then you could start thinking about it. The problem with that is you typically lose total profitability because let's say for example, that was our rule. Our rule in this case is to take profit at 50. Well guess what? If you take profit at 50, you would have taken profit much earlier in this trade. So you have to reconcile that with you. In the way that you think about the movement, this doesn't look great. I thought it moved more than this. Did I have to go too? Oh, that's right. Wait, this doesn't look great. There it goes. It didn't show it for a second. So in this case, if we look at it and we said we're going to take 50 max profit from here. You're out here. You're out of the trade there. So then when you stood to make 510, you now only made your 50 on that. You made your 205. So in this kind of context, we have to decide if the naked short put is being traded to capture theta or if we're trying to capture a directional move.

Because for me, if I'm trading a naked short put to capture some sort of directional move, I'm simply going to follow the move. I'm not going to worry so much about the percentage of remaining theta. I'm going to focus more on following the move in and of itself. If I'm trading for theta, completely different story. So if I put this trade on to provide positive theta for the portfolio, and I was expecting to take in 510 total theta dollars over the life cycle of the trade, then essentially nothing has changed here. I still have them. Now, the only thing that's changed is I've have a much better probability of making that money. Now, I do have the option, if I'm so inclined, to roll the trade to try to make more money to take advantage of a strong trend. But otherwise, there's no real change that's required in the strategy. Because if that's the context that I put it on, I want to make 510 over the course of the 51 days. If it happens faster, it just increases the probability of me making the 510.

Who pays me when I stay in after buying a call? This might be easier. I like visuals. I'm a simple man. Lauren, what color do you like? We have different kinds of yellows. We have green.

In this case, you bought to open one call for a dollar, which is 100. You've paid that money. So nobody pays you. Think of it this way. Every time you BTO, this is a debit, which is money out. Every time you STO sell to open, this is a credit, this is money in. Lauren, does that make sense? So in this case, nobody pays you anything, even though you have fucking tall ass legs that can like step over buildings and stuff. Here's a building as a window. You could easily step over that if you wanted because you told me you have fucking gargantuan ass legs. Now, well, you said tall. So I interpreted that as gargantuan ass legs, maybe even taller legs.

Let's are you talking about like when you exit your trade because if so, we can talk about that as well. But I want to make sure that you understand that Lawrence is okay. So I bought a call last week for 10 and made 265 who paid that first question. Is the call still open? Let me get rid of that. Is the call still open? So now Lauren is down here with her tall legs and the scenario continues. So she bought to open this one call at 1. She told me she bought it for 10. So it would have been 0.10.

What was the most challenging period in your trading career and how did you overcome it? Oh man, that's a deep question to like just fucking quickly pivot to. I think the most I think the most over like the most challenging. Two, there's two periods. The first one is feeling completely overwhelmed by the amount of information and the way that I overcame that was by slowly starting to learn a little bit and being comfortable with the incremental progress. So that's the first period. And then the second period I think was when I realized after how much time and effort I spent learning how much work I needed to do to build something that works. That's kind of really frustrating because if you think about what you learn in school and how you learn in school, you learn something you take a test. But the difference is is like there is no test. That's not how you make money in trading. The way you make money in trading is the practical application of the skill set, which is a far departure from simply taking a test and being able to remember things. It's",

That's when I started getting really obsessed with paper trading. So that I could test ideas and then build a corresponding data set. So then I could actually study the ideas. The next question was how has your approach to emotional discipline changed over the years and what advice would you give on managing emotions in trading? There's a lot to this one, but it really comes down to a really high, high overview. The piece here on what advice would I give on managing emotions is do your best to train yourself to have decreased emotions. And what I mean by that is anybody that's in the discord, if somebody starts talking to me about how much money they made and how happy they are, I always try to work with them on this because while it's good to feel excited and happy, the problem with that in trading is that if you feel excited and happy when things go your way, you're going to feel super shitty when they don't.

You don't get one of those without the other. So the way that I try to think about it to people is I focus so much on the application of the process and less on the outcome. And that makes it so much easier to decrease overall emotions in trading. But the first thing is getting in the habit of not letting yourself be happy or sad about the outcome of a trade. Like I try to get I try to get rid of that as soon as you can. And it sounds sad, right? It's like, oh man, but I want to be happy when I win. Again, if you're happy when you win, you're going to be really upset when you lose. So to me, the way that I look at it is I focus on the application of the skill set and the process. As long as I do that, I can be happy with myself. I can say I executed exactly as I'm supposed to, regardless of the outcome, that I can always reward myself for. But if you reward yourself on the outcome of trades, that's an emotional roller coaster that I think is just a terrible, terrible",

But next to what specific or habits have helped you improve as a trader. This is literally as simple as it gets. Trading plan, trading log, strategy outlines, that's it. The thing when it comes to improving as a trader is completely getting over the fact that there is no, there literally is no fucking way that you are going to remember all relevant details objectively and make good decisions off of them. So the specific thing that changes everything is when you force yourself to think through things before you do them and you ignore impulse, you manage impulse and do the correct thing. Then once you place a trade, it's putting it in your trade log. And then when it's in your trade log and the trade resolves, we don't just delete the trade out of the trade log because it went in or favor or didn't. We input the data so that we can track it. Something to like that habit is essentially the biggest one that matters. It's not like what kind of shit you choose to look at it a daily basis. It's not, you know, making sure",

So it is unequivocally required. I'd rather be skiing says it can help you spot when you're off track and not following your system's rules. That's exactly correct. And here's the rub. It's so easy. This is one of my big frustrations when people say something like, oh, build a plan and always trade your plan never deviate. And I always think like, yeah, no fucking shit.

If you think it's good, it's just so frustrating to me because it's so disingenuous. So to me, the biggest part about this is to figure out how to build a plan that you trust. Because if you think about what causes people to deviate from a plan, for example, if I gave you instructions and my instructions were very clear, it was concise.

The hardest part traders are going to have is building a plan that they trust. If I gave you a plan that you understood inside and out, you know it from A to Z, you understand all of the inputs. There's nothing in there that you have questions about. And it's the plan to trade profitably every day. You go through it. There's no questions. You understand how each piece works. You understand all the indicators, the signals. And there's a broad swath of data that shows that it makes money. You understand the ins and outs of it. Your probability of trading that plan without deviating is massively high, massively high. Because you understand it. You believe in the outcome. So then your reason for deviation is about gone.

We don't trust if that's the right answer because we understand that it's decreasing total profitability, although increasing win rate. And if you don't know the answer, then you kind of deviate from it. The only solution here is to build your own shit that you trust. It's the only solution because there have been studies done. I've referenced this before and it's hilarious where if people are given a, in a test, a black, a black box strategy, meaning you don't know how it works. You don't see it.

How do you maintain consistent in your trading when the markets become volatile? Yeah, no difference. The way I look at the markets is my job is to see what the markets are doing and get in where I fit in. So I don't care if the markets are volatile, not volatile. I essentially just continue to trade my strategies and apply the strategies that work in those conditions correctly. That's all. That's a pretty easy one. That Lawrence has ever had to revamp your plan and pivot tons of times. I view plans as like evolving tools. I don't really view plans as like these static things because markets change. Lots of things change. So I definitely don't view them as things that are stuck in the mud. But the process of changing pieces of a plan have to be well thought out. And if you start with a well thought out plan, then the burden for what's required in order to logically change the plan is higher.

So if I have something that has a 70 win rate, and I go through a path where I have, let's say, 70 win rate over a month or something, just picking an example. And let's say I look back over the application of that strategy for the month, and it's a 30 win rate. That's a pretty big deviation. That's a problem. So then in order to understand that deviation, I have to understand the strategy more. So for example, if I look at the historic data that I have on this strategy that I should have before I trade it, and I see the worst period that it ever had before then was a 58 losing month or something. Well, then that tells me I need to maybe pause that strategy and see what's going on, because the standard deviation from the expectation is so high that there's a problem. The inverse example is let's say I have a 70 win rate. I'm supposed to win 70 of the trades on the strategy over the course of this month. At the end of the month, it comes in at 62.

So it starts like, mirroring itself down. That's kind of a trend that I've picked up on for some time now. So that's exactly why paper trading is not negotiable. Because it is the only way to objectively make decisions. Otherwise, it is all fucking guessing. And then there's no shock why people don't trust their guesses. Why would you?

    "text": "going to build stuff that fits my circumstance. So that's why I don't have FOMO because I'm trading my circumstance, not somebody else's. And I'm using things that I know work because I've tested them. And I have over 16 years of live data that I had to build admittedly for the first part of my trading. Because I didn't keep logs at all. I literally had to go back through my old bank state, well, the broker statements and essentially build what I could for a log for those periods. So they're not direct logs. They're because I didn't log in the beginning. It's a giant mistake. But this is I'm coming up on my 17th year of doing this. So yeah, I kind of I know how this all gets down at this point. So what I do is the same shit and it's stuff that I've built over time. So it's why I don't have FOMO. It's why when I'm making decisions on managing a trade or managing a system, I know how to do it objectively. And it's going to be done through data. That's the only correct answer through data. All right, game time for me to go grab some dinner. Absolutely great time hanging out chat and trading tomorrow. We have GME Sunday. We have outlier pro live stream market prep talking trading. As always, if there's anything you need, let me know. Feel free. If there's anybody that you want to invite to",
