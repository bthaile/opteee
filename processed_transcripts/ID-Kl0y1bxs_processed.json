Then I want to walk through a little bit more of the AMA questions that I got for last week that I didn't get to. And before all of that, one of the things I want to start doing on these beginner trading sessions is recapping the markets, not from me, from you. So to start us off, I would love everybody that's watching and able to throw into the chat one thing that you saw this week can be something interesting, can be something you didn't understand. It can be something that was a first for you. It could be something that you thought was going to happen and happened. It could be literally anything related to the markets. The reason why I want to start this process is because one of my underlying assumptions is I would guess most of you may not have a specific cycle or habit to reconcile what happened in the market on a daily basis.

If I had to guess a lot of people will go through the look at the markets every day, which is awesome. But my guess is we're not taking the time to synthesize what happened and kind of acknowledge what happened for our minds to cling onto because there's a ton of learning that happens when we very meaningfully go through and review what happened in the military we call it an AAR after action review or report if you're writing it like an officer does, which is super annoying. They're not fun. But it's the process of analyzing things but very purposefully. So let's see. We have Jimmy saying GME going down, down and down sort of. I mean, I did a video right before this looking at GameStop and it actually didn't, it didn't create her too far. I think it's when I look at GME, I actually view this as running sideways, consolidating. So maybe that's a good first starting point for us. Right? Because when I think about GME going down, I would think of GME approaching near term lows. And I'm sure some of what you're saying is just ingest, right? That it's not necessarily going the direction we want, which I totally get here for here for that. But just",

That it's not necessarily going the direction we want, which I totally get here for here for that. But just to again, clarify, I actually don't think GME is going through in this case right now. It looks like it's actually consolidating pretty well. Now to your broader point, if this does start rotating over, that does start looking like downside to me. Now, if we think about analyzing a chart, again, I'm going to use these as learning experiences for everybody. If we're analyzing a chart, what's one of the first things we can do to identify if something is in an uptrend, downtrend consolidation? And you'll notice that within this single chart, depending on the aggregation period, you'll notice actually all of those. But what do we look for? There's a couple very simple things. Actually, yeah, let me caveat that question with I want the most simple variations you can think of. I'm not looking to be super complex. Reese says linear regression channel sloping. That's great. So these are standard deviation channels, but linear regression channel, standard deviation channels either or totally cool. I think both of those are correct. That's actually one of the beautiful parts about these broader statistical measures of price movement is that it inherently gives you a trend, right? Straight up.",

Coming to an apex. Okay, I like that. Let's talk about that. If I were to classify the primary indicators of a general trend, linear regression channel, standard deviation channels, either of those, immediately shows it to you. Literally, it makes it undeniable what it is. I can see it based on the slope of these lines. What's even more important to me to determine trend is the relative position of highs and lows. Sometimes I'll call them terms. Sometimes I'll call them swing. It's because I'm lazy. I use them interchangeably. But let's take a look. We have a high here. Then we go down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, we have a low here. Then we go up, up, up, up, up, up, up, we have a higher low here. Then we go up, up, up, up, up, up, up, then we have a high. What do you notice about this high compared to the other high that I showed you? Jesse is already all over it.

So one of the things that you should identify here is that it very rarely is a clear and very clear. It's very rarely is this beautiful, higher highs, lower lows stacked without ever having again, higher lows that then turn into lower lows. So when we're talking about the world of analyzing technical analysis and the price movement of things, context is so important. So that's why we tend to use multiple indicators. We use other things to help us understand context. To which Lauren says, UG, Lauren, why UG? Feel like that's fair. Don't agree? Or we don't like that. But that is the reality of things is that we have to pay attention to the positions of lows and highs. That's one of the easiest ways to determine trends.

It's a good guess, but it actually doesn't depend on the trade at all. Time is objective. Like one day is objectively one day. Now, I understand your concept regarding the thesis of the trade and the way that you choose to trade. That could be a long term timeframe or a short term timeframe. 100 completely agree with you.

So I don't know, maybe just Californians might have found a little cold. I throw that out there because we're just trying to get by here, right? And Southern California that's it's we're just one day at a time. It's very difficult for us. So while we're going through our very challenging high 60s, low 70s, moderately cloudy weather. If I am to analyze what is what's a higher probability play for the weather tomorrow? If I need to guess what it is, what I look at the weather today, what I look at the weather six months ago. Any guesses? It's pretty self-explanatory, right? The best predictor of the weather tomorrow is the weather today. So what I'm looking at with respect to a chart is that as you add time, the susceptibility to new factors in new market, new market movement enters the equation.

    "text": "factors in new market, new market movement enters the equation. Now, I have to be abundantly clear because I do not what again, I find this all the time with people is that they take the inverse of what I'm saying, which is a it's a common logical fault that people have. I'm not suggesting that short term timeframes are more predictable in the sense that a lot of people interpret that to mean, meaning in a really short term timeframe, it's a fucking crap shoot if something goes up or down, it's a crap shoot. I'm not suggesting that short term timeframes are predictable to that degree. What I'm highlighting is that if I were to analyze the expected price performance of GameStop on Monday when the market opens, my guess is that it's going to be something around here that we'll see. Whether it's up or down, I do not know. How far in this range it goes up or down, I also do not know. Now, as we think about the probability of news coming out over the weekend to influence GameStop, right, there's two days until the market opens. Okay, that's time for things to change things to happen. Now, if we think about if it's a trading week, the difference between day to day, it's much less, right, it's less than 24 hours that we can experience new information coming into change things. It's a lower window for new material information to enter the equation.",

It's a lower window for new material information to enter the equation. As we stack more and more time, we stack bigger and bigger windows for new information to enter the equation. This is exactly why when we look at stuff like a probability cone, let's take a look at this probability cone. What do you notice? Don't worry about the teardrop function of it. You can ignore that for now. But what do you notice about the shape of this teardrop cone? And for that's not a teardrop cone, by the way, I'm just trying to make it more accessible to people. This is a parabola. It's a probability projection using one standard deviation move. But what do you notice the further out we go? If this is the expected high range, this is the expected low range. As I go further out in time, what do you see about the expected high range low range compared to if I look at something 20 days out, the expected high range low range compared to something that's. What do you notice about how this looks wider? Jesse's on it. Much wider. So as we add duration to things, we add time for new things to enter into the pricing models and then",

So as we add duration to things, we add time for new things to enter into the pricing models and then to move price. So the way that we look at something like a three month chart. Now, from again, to Joey's earlier point, for your perspective as a trader, that could feel like a really long time. If you're an intraday trader, three months can feel like an eternity. Or if you're an investor, three months doesn't even register on your fucking radar. It doesn't matter. You move in years, not months. So there's a relative component based on the style of the trader. But there's a objective component based on the ingestion of information and the probabilistic movement of things that expands over time. So if I take a look at 90 days here, I can tell you the expected range over a 90 day period within one standard deviation. If I do the probability of a touch over 90 days, we're looking at a within a one standard deviation move. We're looking at 37 to 10 and three quarters. If I look at that over a one week move, we're looking at 25, which is 12 points lower to 17, just seven points higher. That is objectively a massive difference.

That is objectively a massive difference. So in this time frame, there's the probability for way more information to enter the equation, thus moving price. So three months is actually a moderate length of time, right? Because as we look at, if we plotted the changes day over day, you'll notice that the relationship is somewhat linear, but not purely. So there will be periods where over a five day period that's from 50 to 60 days, there might be a slightly different change in the overall price range expectation, then a shorter five day period, but in a total of 10 day period, right, total 10 day window. So what's the takeaway for all of this? We need to understand the context of timing in the light of how information is integrated into price and thus the subsequent movement of price. That's the first part we need to take away from this section. The second part we need to take away from this section is it is very important for a trader to align their trading concepts, strategies, thesis, profit mechanisms, and strategies with corresponding time frames. Now, again, my guess, if I had everybody pull out their trading plans right now for a pop quiz, my guess is less than a quarter",

How do I find these things? It matters a lot. So I'll give you an example. If I think about trading something like a momentum strategy, I can tell you from a quantitative perspective, I know this objectively to be true because I've studied it. I know that prices stocks that are experiencing larger 52 week price movements are more likely to exhibit continuation of that price movement over the next month, then to something that has a high three month price movement.

I literally just added more to this, by the way, so it really is becoming like this gross abomination. But you already know about the big four strategy process that's literally what I'm describing right now. So the way that all of this comes back into time frames is because when I look at something like a profit mechanism that I'm trying to extract, I need to figure out what time frames are most suitable one for the profit mechanism itself, but then also to analyze the presence of it and the corresponding indicators. So that is the starting point here. So literally all of that came off of one person's singular observation, but as you know, I'm always happy to go down rabbit holes, but let me go back up. I want to grab a couple others that you all saw. I see Reese says oil rallied oil did rally. That's a good observation. Let's talk about the rally and oil really fast. That's actually one of the things we're going to talk about today because I have a trade",

Like what what's going on here? Does anybody know the context behind oils move? Now I want to be clear. The context behind oils move doesn't actually matter that much. The reason I'm looking up, by the way, as I've screen up here, I'm just looking at futures. War that's a big part of it. So when Iran and Israel started kicking off with one another. It definitely moved oil, but it already started to base here. Right. So that was a massive catalyst. But then what go we have to go further, right. So the impact of in Israeli Iran conflict. It's spider webs like most things in the market. So then when we're trading something there's a reason for this rabbit hole, by the way. So if we're trading something like this.

How long does that last? Those kinds of details can be baked into a strategy. Now I want to be also very, very clear. You don't even need to know any of that to trade a movement. You don't need to know any of it.

What I probably have to do compared to if I'm just trading this recent surge and fully expect to just get out when it reverses. What would you, how would you vary the amount of research that goes into those? First mango orange is down. That happened quick. That happened real quick. Damn. I have a second one, but now the question is, do I do the second mango orange already or do I do the lemon, seltzer water and slow down? I think I rage and go for second mango orange.

And the idea of aligning thesis with profit mechanism with strategy. The summary of this section so far before we go into the trades and all this stuff will do that in a little bit. But when I take a look at the longer term price movement, you'll notice that this actually is kind of bucking the trend, right? So for me, if you're trading something via a breakout strategy, this clearly isn't the continuation of something because over the last year, I'm coming down pretty hard. So we'll talk about the trade itself in a little bit, but I want you to start thinking more carefully about the amount of research that's being done. And then the corresponding trade period that aligns with that. And it's I guess I should actually reverse that right? The trade period then the corresponding amount of research. Because if I'm trading something on a really short term timeframe, it's a giant, it's a giant miss. It doesn't make any sense. So you have to make sure that those things are aligned is the punch line. Potato says Eric and a stream with Yahoo Finance charts tomorrow. That's exactly it.

We go to Yahoo Finance charts for that one. Cedric says, did you see all the wrinkles of RC? I don't know what that refers to. Confuses me. Jimmy says, why are you always so thirsty? It's because I intermittent fast. So now is typically when I start feeding and consuming way more liquid. So like throughout most of the day, I actually don't drink a ton. I mean, I drink a lot of fluid, like always, because like I'm even though I have a fucked up back right now, and have sciatic on all this bullshit, like I'm still as active as I possibly can be. So I always make sure I'm hydrated. Like there's never a good reason to be dehydrated. So I do drink a lot for that. But especially in the evenings, it picks up because what I end up doing is I stop consuming fluids at around like 2100, like 9 p.m. my time to so like it's all got to be done by then. So here's another sip. The other thing when I'm doing live streams like this, and just kind of talking a lot, my mouth gets dry. So it naturally benefits that as well. Oh, interesting.

That's like essentially what it boils down to. If you're holding for something greater than a year, that's your trade thesis. Is you think the company is going to grow? That's the only reason why the stock price would go up in that time frame. It's the only thing that ultimately matters in that circumstance is price go up. In that scenario, if it's a long term holding, then the way I would look at it is they doesn't actually matter that much. What it's doing on a day to day basis provided that from a fundamental perspective, you believe that to be the case from your analysis that in a year from now, it will be worth more as a company than it is today. So then the stock price would then match that value. That's how I think about that kind of thing. So it's a good like it's a good differentiation, I suppose, but at least from my perspective, long term holdings are based so much more on fundamental components, not saying that you have to go in and do what most people think about with respect to fundamental analysis, like you don't have to in my opinion, you",

That's how I would think about that. Sam says the premiums are good for CSP, but again, middle of trend, would you initiate a CSP?

    "text": "the thing I can tell you is that like it's not I already see like misalignment right so you're saying I want to hold it for long. Okay, so then if you want to hold it for long, then what are we doing? If you are worried about this short term trend because you want to hold it for long, then do you actually want to hold it for long? My guess is probably not if that doesn't align. So I think in your case, the first thing actually would be reconciling those components because I don't think that those two ideas align at least from like a general analysis lens. Just don't see it makes sense there. You want to hold it for long, then I would hold it if I don't want to hold it for long because I'm nervous about this short term trend, then don't hold it. So. Re says if a trade goes away with the CSP, you'll never own it. Yep. So that's another I have a couple videos that talk about the wheel and some of the big drawbacks of the wheel. So this is actually pretty old at this point. I think I might have to refresh this video at some point that video. But that's a massive drawback of the wheel. And that's actually why I think a big part of it comes down to just literally gaining exposure to the underlying itself. If you want exposure to the underlying itself,",

If you want exposure to the underlying itself, and then if you don't want exposure for whatever reason, right, like it's in the middle of a trend, you're not convinced on what direction it's going to go. Then to me, it tells us a slightly different story. It's not time to enter until it clearly defines what way it's going for your strategy and your timeframe. But yeah, I just see a little bit of a misalignment there as far as I can see. Cool. So let's jump over now to this conversation I was having in the discord. So this is with one of our discord members and essentially they were saying that they think they got out a little early on the MCL trade. It hit a high of 7557, which would have been about four times the profit realized probably should have set up some sort of trailing stop. Now, there's a bunch of things I want to highlight about this again from a broad perspective. This isn't to pick on anybody. This is to help people learn. So the very first thing is I noticed the first mention of crude oil in this case earlier today. Right. So this isn't something that was based",

Some sort of long term analysis that then led to a head where it's like, ah, now I have my entry. I didn't see that. So this from the origin looked like an impulse trade. It looked like crude oil was moving. We wanted to participate in the move so that we got into crude oil. That's the first thing. And I think that as an origin for a trade is a bad trade entry. So when I think about when I'm placing a trade, whether a trade is good or bad does not tie to if it's profitable or not profitable. A good trade can lose money. A bad trade can make money. What makes a trade good or bad is the foundation for the trade itself. That is what is most important because if we don't do that, then we immediately over prioritize the outcome of an individual trade, which in the grand scheme of things does not matter.

That scenario. Okay. If that's the game plan that's still a plan, but it's kind of like hitting the lot of pretty low probability. So for most of us that are trading based on systems, meaning the application of something over time, the outcome of an individual trade does not matter. It should be nearly fully deprioritized. The parts that matter the absolute most are the conditions and the strategy in how that's managed. The reason why that matters is because that's what leads to a replicable thing over time that you can then do again and again and again with some idea on outcome potential. So in this case, we didn't even think about the trade ahead of time, right? And then when we get into the trade because it went further, then we're like, ah, shit, I should have done something else.

I reduce them down to the smallest component just for ease. So the trade is not this size. The trade is quite a bit larger than this as it sits now. So let's look at those two entries 30 step one oct. Why those two days? Let's go to crude oil. And then let's go in to a three month. So 30 step is right here. One oct is right here. Why these days? A bunch of reasons. This was catching a falling knife. This was a prospecting entry on an expected eventual turnaround that was entirely based on the risk side of the equation.

So as crude fell down here, I wanted to know how far is it going to go before it starts to grab a bite. So I saw the next day I grabbed a bite. So then I was curious, OK, does it grab here and then fall right similar to this down down down grabbed then fell. That does not mean that it couldn't fall just didn't hear. So then I create a probabilistic guess. I say, OK, do I think it's more likely to start reversing here or my actual expectation was consolidation first. That's what I expected. Do I think it's going to consolidate and then break one way or the other. That was my best guess. But from a risk side of the equation, where do I view my downside risk? What like 65 here? So then if I enter here with bulk size for what the exposure is that I want. And I'm perceiving an initial floor something around here at 65. What do I think about that risk? How can I size this trade so that risk makes sense? And then can I contextualize this low? So I'm only looking at three months.",

Where's the low on the year? I don't see anything here. I have to go out further. Where do I see the low on three years? Interesting. I see the low that generally lines up over here.

And I talk about that in general, like I prefer the micros because you can get very specific with your sizing. Right. Because if you're using the larger futures crude oil and stuff like that, my account size can definitely handle it. But it's not so much whether or not the account size can handle it. I am very much a scaling trader. I like to have the ability to move into and out of things. So if you look at crude oil futures by themselves, they're relative or their notional exposures like 73 grand or 74 grand per future. So in this case, typically, and a lot of times I'll do this with stuff like this. If I feel convicted, I would have started the entry with regular crude. So forward slash CL. And then I would add additional via MCL to get exactly where I want to be as I'm scaling in. But I did not have a ton of faith in this position.

    "text": "get left behind. I think we're going to do boneless wings tonight. Um, Joey says I was I was going to ask how you can hedge against an overnight gap risk. It's futures, man. I don't hedge. One, I sized the trade appropriately to I just rest orders. That's that's why for stuff like commodities and it's why even for equities. It's why I really like trading futures. For instance, you're using patterns or more so candlesticks neither I don't use either heavily. I use candlesticks to analyze what the movement was, but I don't care if it's bearish engulfing, bullish engulfing like I don't really do any of those. So I look at candlesticks to help me understand what the flavor was for the day. So for example, we can look at some near term stuff to give you ideas like this here. So this big red candle, we opened, we had a little bit of a rally that died and got pushed all the way down. And then we ended up essentially closing near the low of the day. That's a lot of selling pressure that causes that this is a different scenario where we have a battle where something wants to go higher enough. Seller step in there like nope too high will take it down and then the same thing to the other side. So that tells me that there's active participation from both buyers and sellers. If I see these big blocky candles like this,",

Joey says, what if it gaps past your resting order? Maybe I'm a little confused. Yeah, that's that's they trade 24 seven. So like right now it could get they don't trade 24 seven. I'm sorry, that's hyperbole. They trade near 24 seven. So futures are closed right now and then they'll open Sunday. So there could be gap risk from now to Sunday and that's always handled via sizing the trade logically. But the standard throughout the week is there is they trade after hours. They'll close for a little bit and then they'll open back up. And then all night they trade that's why you guys will see me in the discord sometimes post trades at 11 o'clock at night before I go to bed. I'll be tweaking a few things before I crash out. So yeah, the gap risk is only when futures are closed, which is a small window, essentially now. And the gap risk there is managed just like the gap risk is managed in literally everything else we trade size size the trade correctly. And you have something set up way too big",

But yeah, for me, futures are a big part of the overall portfolio for those reasons. Joyce says, did you negotiate futures commissions? You know the answer to that is yes, I negotiate everything 100 100. Joyce says, do you usually do you generally use defined resistance or percentages of stop I essentially never use percentage. I don't care about a percentage of stop. I care about where I define support and resistance. So I have a video that I put out not too long ago. Let me see if I can find it. No, don't remember where it is. There's a video about risk, I think. Yeah, I think this one. There you go. The video, it talks about essentially the process that I'll use to manage risk in trades. But the way I look at percentages is they're completely arbitrary. It doesn't mean anything to me if a stock drops 6 8 12 2 like that that's it's secondary. What I care about is where do I think something might trade to without going through and then move back up and out. Now I have to make sure that whatever that is as defined still makes sense. So what that means is let's say for example, I wanted to enter crude oil here. But if I look at crude oils entry here,",

So what that means is let's say for example, I wanted to enter crude oil here. But if I look at crude oils entry here, I can see that essentially it's traded below these levels, right, very near term. It was below below this 67 handle here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, and here. So there's a lot of recent instances where crude dropped below that near term support. So then I have to set up wherever I would consider support to be where it is. I already walk through that whole process why I set it up about where it is around 65. So then my entry is as a completely different shape because my entry now is at 74 with the expected support down at 65 as compared to entry at 68 with expected support at 65. So entries here can be done, but then they have to be sized completely differently. The size that I pick for a trade in terms of overall risk has to make sense based on what these relationships look like. So for example, this trade here, I was able to size up way more because I view near term support as it is. So it gives me essentially again a lower risk entry.

So they have to marry with one another so that it makes sense. It's a good question. Santo says, when you enter the order for futures, do you also enter exit orders? The ones in soft stops. Is it already like entered together? You just play it out? What kind of proportion? No. So if I'm trading something soft spot soft stop is not going to be entered that's almost always a mental stop for me to review. I very often will exit on a soft stop. But yeah, that's just a mental exit. And then or hard stops there either entered or I'm just going to exit when they hit there. It depends on if I'm around the computer or not. So if I'm going to be out moving around and I wouldn't be able to monitor get on my phone real fast if it's triggered, then I would go in and enter it. But otherwise, I would rest it now.

There is a big difference though, because if I'm resting a hard stop, I'm already giving it a lot of room to move essentially the grace that I would give it somewhere else. So for example, a soft stop here for this example would look at something like below the 66. That would be a soft stop for me again using these entry days as the example. And the reason why it's a soft stop is because I would want to see how it behaves as it penetrates below those levels. But it's gone down below those levels a couple times and is siphoned back up. So I wouldn't want to rest in order there because that becomes an unnecessary stop. So that's why soft stop in this case is mental. The hard stop is entered below that level. And then I typically give it a little extra room so that it is an undeniable move that would stop me out in the equation. So I do not rest orders on the soft stops hard stops a little bit different. If I'm resting in order on a hard stop, then it needs to be essentially completely outside of where the acceptable range would be. James says futures are nastily the same as as any equity, but you",

So futures they they move in points and ticks. They don't move in dollars. So like as we look at crude oil, this technically is not 74.45 because the multiplier in something like these different futures are different. So like if we use for slash ES. This is not 57 95 50.

It doesn't move in that increment. So the tick is the smallest size that it'll move in this case. It's 25 0.25. You can call it 25 cents if that's just easier to wrap the head around.

This would be I'm setting a couple alerts is this actually looks interesting to the downside. So let's just say I wanted to sell puts in here. I don't but let's use it as an example again. I just want to look at something I don't look at a lot. So let's say that actually let's go into paper trading and then let's go back here. So we're going to trade a favorable period in here. So this is 15. Ogg 26 let's go to 15. Here we go 15 on beautiful. And let's say that the idea here is again we're bullish for whatever reason. I'm overfitting. I'm looking at a period that I know how it works just because I want to show an example. Corey says",

I'm looking at a period that I know how it works just because I want to show an example. Corey says what the fuck are those volume notes it's exactly at their volume notes. So volume profile essentially plots where things trade at price levels. So it essentially takes all of the volume that you see down here. It turns it on its side and it doesn't care anymore. It's not based on a time series. So it's not based on date. The volume here is based simply at where it's transacted at. So let's oh I see what you mean sorry you're asking like what what were the I see sorry I thought you were asking like what the what the indicator was my bad. Okay cool yeah so this is all loaded up we can look. So we're going to go to the next one. We guys think this is 49 and a half this feels okay feel like I'm a little less slouching like this this feels better. Let's take a look at two things. Again I don't care how liquid it is and stuff I'm just going to force a trade on so we can look at the example. Let's take a look at the perfect the 36 DTE. Now for me I literally have a matrix",

Let's take a look at the perfect the 36 DTE. Now for me I literally have a matrix setup based on DTE. Dazed expiration from entry so I also track DIT days in trade. And I created a matrix based on a broad data set that I manage and I literally just look at it as it's kind of like a directions at this point. And the way it works is based on whatever DTE I have via entry so this case 36 DTE is the entry based on X numbers of days in trade I then accept different amounts of percent max gain because these are again defined profit the way I manage to find profit trade is completely different than the way that I would manage undefined profit because again let's take a look at this example. So this is 36 days to go. I'm curious if it's going to plot it for us that would be great if it did. Right now it shows me as pre buffering which I always have an issue with that what the fuck is pre buffering could we not just say buffering feel like that's the same thing.

That makes it very difficult to like slide your thumb. And I like to use the swipe text thing. So yeah, I don't know. There's any moral to that story, but just so you know. All right so for this.

We're just working through the good old free buffering. There it goes. So now there were even more, which is super annoying. But we've had a couple down days. This is just telling us volatility is expanding. That's exactly why that's happening. So it's an interesting example. But if we take a look at the call side though, those are making money. So the calls we paid 2.5 and they're up 32 bucks right now. So that's pretty that's pretty fun. Now let's move time forward a bit more. I'm going to go with a bigger adjustment. We'll go to like the 30th maybe. Did I fuck the date up? I thought it had like this big rally. What is this 26? Let's see what it looked like on the 26th. What I'm hoping to show you is based on different price move. Oh, maybe we'll just go back and trade this one. This is way better of an example. Let's go back to nine July. Yeah. Okay, let's do that.

Okay, let's do that. This will go way faster. So we're going to go back to nine July is right here. What I'm trying to show you is that depending on how the underlying is moving, that should and will inform what makes sense in terms of profit taking. So this goes all the way back to Corey's question. It's just slow going as it sits now. Let's see what this loads us in that. I'll be able to fast forward it way more. So now this has 16 aug so 38 days in 101. So something like that again, we're just going to pretend that these are liquid. So looking at these, we would sell them for 25 cents. And it is a 38 day trade. So let's analyze that. I'm going to kill these other ones super fast just to keep the example simple. And then let's fast forward now to like the 18th. So remember, it's a 38 day trade. And I'm going to go to the 16th actually. 28 day trade. So now if we go into the trade tab again, we would have sold them for 25.

About what you might expect to see from an experiment, which is what we're doing. We're experimenting right now. So what do you expect? Perfect. So let's do this 51 DTE. This is ideal. And this is great. So let's say we sell these 170s. Perfect. We get 510. So 51 DTE. We're going to sell the 170s. At 510. Cool. Reese says I had a cook dinner and I got lost. So I'm not expected shit. That's perfect. It's like a jack in the box. You'll just expect a surprise then. So before I show you the answer though, I'm actually like I genuinely am very curious. Let's let's talk about what we think might happen. I showed you already what the PNL graph looks like. Right. So if we have PNL. And then we have stock price. We know it goes like this.

Now we also know that our PNL increases like this. As the stock price moves this way. Right. So if current price in this case, I didn't even look at what Tesla was in the example. I have no idea. But let's pretend that now. When we get this next view. It will be here. So do you notice how the PNL from your short put is not just the passage of time. But if you get an accommodating price move like this. You can realize more money faster. So then we have to think about the logistics of this. So is at 170 and stock was at 193. So now let's fast forward. Let's just go to the fifth. Of the following month. July. Should be a big move up. There it is. I'm actually going to go back one day just to remove any instance of volatility. Which would be the third. It was close on the fourth.

So for somebody else in the chat. Corey or Lauren since I've seen both of your names fairly recently. Do you understand what Joey just said? The reason why I'm asking this is because this concept is so important. And this concept that we're going through from a premium selling perspective is exactly why the idea of profits profit or you don't go broke taking profits. Doesn't make sense in trading. It literally doesn't make sense in trading. It's a terrible adage that does not relate well to trading. It's completely broken. So Lauren says that she's on target with us. Okay. So now. Let's take a look at our position. It's worth one 17 and it's three July. So we now have 44 DTE. The same position is now at one 17. So what do we think? What's happened here? Well, let's just do a little bit of math. And before I show you how to do the math. You tell me what math do you think we should do? Again, this is a hopefully an interactive learning",

Because I already see different answers. So let's take a look at our Tesla trade, Tesla trade. 44, we have seven debt seven days in trade. We made one 17 or no, we have one 17 remaining. Made. Three, ninety three. Seven days in trade of 51, ETE. Take trade down. Let trade go. And for this case, it's a one lot. So there is no take some profit. I'm just removing that for simplicity. There is no choice to take some of it down because we've sold one. So let's see what the answers are. I'm actually very eager to see these responses. Because from the first few, I actually already saw like some differences that I didn't expect. So right now we're 60 40 split with five votes. We need a couple more people to vote. There's 41 outliers here, 42. Somebody just joined. And we're going to be able to vote for the next one. So let's see if we can get. Ideally, I would love 15 responses. 15 is again, that's like a statistically significant number for the for the stats",

How do we come up with the response that makes logical sense because both what Joey says and I'd rather be skiing say absolutely matter because guess what there's another two factors that we have to consider.

It's a five delta. So the probability of this trade working out meaning probability of being out of the money is like seventy percent. Now the probability of this trade working out is like ninety five percent. So what's happened well we've made a bunch of money in seven days. Right we have three hundred ninety three dollars here that we've made in seven days. We only have one seventeen left to go most traders look at this and say no brainer we've made the bulk of the profit in very little time take the trade down make the money and then move on to the next. The issue with that is your probability in the trade has just increased massively you've got a twenty five percent bump there's a ninety five percent chance now. That you make this remaining one seventeen. What's the downside well it's a five delta. So now this one seventeen without price movement is going to be slow.

Here was about a week. Oh it was a week. I mean it is. It was a twenty two delta. So now if we go back here what's our theta on the one seventy six cents. So our theta is contracted pretty meaningfully forty percent. So per day you now make less money. White the conundrum. So what's the right answer is the right answer to take the trade down is the right answer to let the trade go. So now I'm going to do the poll one more time. Okay. So now you have a couple of other factors to consider. You have the factor of probability being integrated. You have the factor of theta slowing down. Those are two of the big changes that have happened here. You have the factor of you have less money that you can make on the residual time remaining. So let's see what the choices are.

We already know that from what we looked at before. So we have in this case. Ten dollars a day in theta now we have six dollars a day in theta. Tommy is looking at a good part, a good answer. I think Tommy says maybe there's a better place for my money now. So we start. That's a consideration. We need two more votes. So we have forty six percent. We're literally split fifty fifty now. There we go. We have our sixteen votes. Thank you guys very, very much for voting. And so we have fifty six that take it down. We have forty three percent that let it go. Here's the correct answer. It depends. The answer entirely depends on the way that you trade this strategy. It depends in its entirety. Why would it depend? Why would this depend? Because the people that said that they would take it down are not wrong. And the people that said that they would leave it on are not wrong. Literally not wrong in either scenario.

You had to know that that was coming. I don't think I said depends yet in this whole thing. The reason why it depends is because expected return. Do you guys remember the conversation about expected return? And kind of how it works. First let me throw a video in here for you and then we'll look at an example together really fast. Ah, this is the video that I wanted to show you. There it is. Perfect. So we have to value expected return. Which, oh yeah, I forgot. We built a little calculator together. We did this as a group. Tell us. Okay. Oh, I don't know what we did with it. I don't know all that is. This is all old Eric's that what the fuck is this? This was some sort of example that we did. Oh, this was looking at that strategy from that dude. Okay, got it. I was just trying to figure out what the fuck I was looking at. So let's take a look.

We start this equation where our profit is 510. The probability of profit in this case was 88 because I remember it was a 22 delta.

Let's say that our exit was going to be at 165. I don't think it shows the short. So I'm just going to have to do like the synthetic thing that I do. I'm just going to have to do like the first. You'll just have to bear with me for a second. So let me go back. To the 26th. This is going to move up and then essentially we have to pretend that price moves. And then I'll just adjust the option by it and figure out what the loss would be. So we got into this for 5.1. And then. There it goes. Okay. We got in for 5.1. And we're planning our loss. What did I say at 165. So we have it's trading at 193. We're planning loss at 165. So this equals this minus this. So at 28 point move. Our strike is the 170.

So definitely you can you can exit those whenever you would like. So here. Our expected return is really solid on the trade. It looks good. Now the problem that we run into is that if we look at the expected return, this is for an individual trade. If we change this to be the expected return of a strategy, we run into an interesting conundrum. Because if we start changing the probability or the the profit levels or the probability of profit, if we start changing them too much. Then it can actually start decreasing our expected return potential. So the original trade here looks great. And I can even tell you the adjusted trade with the adjusted probabilities also looks great. This is a great trade across the board. Now if you're able to find other trades like this, then we're good. If not, then circumstances change. So going all the way back",

It depends entirely on the kinds of things you trade the short put with. If it's a naked short put, we don't want to take assignment. The way that you have to build your matrix for profit taking is not super complex. But it has to be done in the context of not decreasing your overall profitability potential and not getting to the point where we're taking profits too fast. And if we take profits too fast, then we have a smaller total profit that we take. So this can start nuking your overall expected return. So kind of a lot. The way that I would think about it to simplify to start is that you don't want to take profits too fast. If you're taking profits within 50 max profit, that sometimes can be okay. That's if you make 50 max profit on in this example of 51 DTE trade. If you make 50 max profit in a week, then you could start thinking about it. The problem with that is you typically lose total profitability. Because let's say for example, that was our rule. Our rule in this case is to take profit",

Now I do have the option if I'm so inclined to roll the trade to try to make more money to take advantage of a strong trend. But otherwise there's no real change that's required in the strategy. Because if that's the context that I put it on, I want to make 510 over the course of the 51 days. If it happens faster, it just increases the probability of me making the 510. The entire point of the context on this is to decide ahead of time. Because the last possible thing you want to do is make that decision up on the fly. Because then your probability to fall prey to that exact disposition effect we looked at together not too long ago is exceedingly high.",

So we're buying them. For two. I probably would offer you 260. And then maybe I'm offering them at 275. And my goal is the market maker. And to buy them from you. I get them from you at 265. Because you play the mid price like a smart person. And then I'm looking for somebody to sell them to. So I can sell them to this person for 275. Because they're also smart. First 270. Because they're also smart. And they play the bid as difference. And here. They made 5. They're not looking for things that they like. They're not looking for things that they don't, but they don't know how to where to end. But then they're not looking for things that they do. They don't know what price it is. It doesn't matter to them. They want to get it added obviously as advantageous of a value to themselves as possible. But they're indifferent. Because their goal is to give it to somebody else as soon as Lauren says, now I get it. Perfect. That's great news.

No. Because if you think about post earnings announcement drift ETFs aren't going to have them.

So let's rocket through some of these super fast. What was the most challenging period in your trading career and how did you overcome it? Oh man, that's a deep question to like just fucking quickly pivot to. I think the most I think the most over like the most challenging to there's two periods. The first one is feeling completely overwhelmed by the amount of information and the way that I overcame that was by slowly starting to learn a little bit and being comfortable with the incremental progress. So that's the first period and then the second period I think was when I realized after how much time and effort I spent learning how much work I needed to do to build something that works. That's kind of really frustrating because if you think about what you learn in school and how you learn in school, you learn something you take a test. But the difference is is like there is no test that's not how you make money in trading. The way you make money in trading is the practical application of the skill set which is a far departure from simply taking a test and being able to remember things. It's the practical application side of things",

It's the practical application side of things is really tricky. So the way that I overcame that was by starting to test a lot of things. That's when I started getting really obsessed with paper trading so that I could test ideas and then build a corresponding data set so then I could actually study the ideas. The next question was how has your approach to emotional discipline changed over the years and what advice would you give on managing emotions in trading? There's a lot to this one but it really comes down to a really high overview. The piece here on what advice would I give on managing emotions is do your best to train yourself to have decreased emotions. What I mean by that is anybody that's in the discord if somebody starts talking to me about how much money they made and how happy they are, I always try to work with them on this. Because while it's good to feel excited and happy, the problem with that in trading is that if you feel excited and happy when things go your way, you're going to feel super shitty when they don't.

But the first thing is getting in the habit of not letting yourself be happy or sad about the outcome of a trade. I try to get right of that as soon as you can. And it sounds sad, right? It's like, oh man, but I want to be happy when I win. Again, if you're happy when you win, you're going to be really upset when you lose. So to me, the way that I look at it is I focus on the application of the skill set and the process. As long as I do that, I can be happy with myself. I can say I executed exactly as I'm supposed to, regardless of the outcome, that I can always reward myself for.

The thing when it comes to improving as a trader is completely getting over the fact that there is no, there literally is no fucking way that you are going to remember all relevant details objectively and make good decisions off of them. So the specific thing that changes everything is when you force yourself to think through things before you do them and you ignore impulse, you manage impulse and do the correct thing. Then once you place a trade, it's putting it in your trade log. And then when it's in your trade log and the trade resolves, we don't just delete the trade out of the trade log because it went in or favor or didn't. We input the data so that we can track it.

Like if you have a plan that you really, really believe in and trust, why would you deviate? Right? But you have to like break that down into what it is because the trader gurus that want to sound smart say that shit all the time. Like never deviate from your plan. The problem is is that comes with the assumption that we have a trading plan that we've built",

The problem is is that comes with the assumption that we have a trading plan that we've built and have ultimate confidence in, which is the biggest fucking, that's the biggest difficulty in this process is to build that. So the fact that like people to sound smart just take that as granted and they're just like, oh, just trade your plan. It's like bitch, make the plan. How do you make the plan to then trust and trade? That's the hard part. It's not hard to trade something that you trust. If you think it's good, it's just so frustrating to me because it's so disingenuous. So to me, the biggest part about this is to figure out how to build a plan that you trust. Because if you think about what causes people to deviate from a plan, for example, if I gave you instructions and my instructions were very clear, it was concise. If you told me like, if you're like, hey, I'm trying to go to the EOS gym, right? The one that's right here by me. Okay. Here's how you get to there. I go there every day. Here's how you get there.

Where it's like, if you have one of the things that I use as an example is like, if you're trading something that has a 90 win rate, you're still going to lose 10 of the time. What happens if you get 10 of the time in a streak? It's all in a row. A lot of people get shaken out in those instances. And it's because we don't know what we're doing. We haven't looked at the application of that strategy. And the only way you can do that is through the process of testing. And this is a beautiful segue to motherfucking paper trading. Because for a lot of people, they're not going to pay to buy a bunch of data because it's expensive. And it's difficult to find good back-testing stuff that you trust. So the easiest way you can start doing this is by paper trading. And it's by creating your own data right in that video. That video there talks through the process of testing. It talks about paper trading, back-testing, live-testing. But that's the idea here. Joey says, how do you know when it's time to replant any specific metrics? Yeah. The primary metric is when the performance of the strategy drastically deviates from the expected performance of the strategy. So if I have something that has a 70 win rate, and I go through",

The primary metric is when the performance of the strategy drastically deviates from the expected performance of the strategy. So if I have something that has a 70 win rate, and I go through a path where I have, let's say, 70 win rate over a month or something, just picking an example. And let's say I look back over the application of that strategy for the month, and it's a 30 win rate. That's a pretty big deviation. That's a problem. So then in order to understand that deviation, I have to understand the strategy more. So for example, if I look at the historic data that I have on this strategy that I should have before I trade it, and I see the worst period that it ever had before then was a 58 losing month or something. Well, then that tells me I need to maybe pause that strategy and see what's going on, because the standard deviation from the expectation is so high that there's a problem. The inverse example is let's say I have a 70 win rate. I'm supposed to win 70 of the trades on the strategy over the course of this month. At the end of the month, it comes in at 62. But then I look back at my data because I've done the correct steps and I have the data, then I can say,",

But over the past period of losing months, I've seen the strategy come in at, let's say, you know, supposed to be 70, then it came in at like 68, 69, 64, 66, 63, 66, 62. Right. So it starts like, mirroring itself down. That's kind of a trend that I've picked up on for some time now. So that's exactly why paper trading is not negotiable. Because it is the only way to objectively make decisions. Otherwise, it is all fucking guessing. And then there's no shock why people don't trust their guesses. Why would you? I wouldn't trust my own guess. It's just a fucking guess. And I know it's a guess because I didn't do the work. But if you do the work, then you can lean on something way more heavily. This is why when people will ask me like, Eric, do you have like FOMO? And it's I literally don't have FOMO in trading. I don't care if somebody like Praureen Kitty is making hundreds of millions of dollars trading GameStop. I literally love that for him. It's so awesome. But I know what I'm going to do.",
