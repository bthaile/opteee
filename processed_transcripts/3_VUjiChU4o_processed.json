    "text": "it all played out what worked the best from a back testing perspective was 20 Delta short call short put so a short strangle managed at a 300 Max loss there's a really really really interesting piece that comes with this notice how if we look at something like the 20 Delta strangle with no Loss Management there's 154 winning positions now if we apply a 250 loss management there's now 149 if we look at a 300 Loss Management 152 and then 153 winning trades the reason why this matters is because we do do not want to get stopped out prematurely which is what happened in this 250 scenario this means that there were trades that went outside of our loss management band that actually came back in now fortunately it's actually not that big of a difference and that's why this worked so well this year notice how the Max winners if no no management was applied was 154 so what this means is is that there's only five trades that you artificially cut out and in this case there's only only two trades notice though the change in the max loss this is why it all comes together because the max loss in this trade went from 5,623 bucks and it dropped down to 3360 big change in Max loss this is the exact thing that I'm talking about when I'm saying cut off the tails because if we take a look at a bell curve",
