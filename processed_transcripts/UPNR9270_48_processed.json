    "text": "soon as you have one loss it's at least wiped out two wins and again that's in a frictionless environment it probably would be a little bit worse than that if we're looking at the spreads it's even worse still if we're looking at the 10 short s 5 Longs you have 107 average win with 220 average loss not terrible but then if you're doing the 15 and fives 220 average win 714 average loss so really really difficult to make these up without giving yourself enough Runway to get enough occurrences on so another thing that I like to look at and I can look at in a future study if we' want is the uh propensity for average losing streaks so that you have an idea of what that looks like I use that pretty heavily in all of mine my strategy so that I can at least have an understanding of what is likely to occur it's not limited to that you can always have longer streaks but it gives me some ideas so it doesn't feel like I'm flying quite blind so hope the video is useful specifically zert options for small accounts it's a tricky Prospect but can be done SPX again is the preferable tool in my opinion but something like XSP is also viable and it will trade at a tenth the size as SPX it will give you similar performance overall to what I just showed the difference is the spreads",
