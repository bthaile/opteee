    "text": "hey everyone eric here up next is a pretty fun topic which is trading in your iras so let's jump over to the main screen and dig in so first off the very first thing i have on here is if you are interested in setting up a roth ira do yourself a favor and make sure you do it as soon as possible and max it out as frequently as possible and here's the reason why i'm gonna pull up a quick overview that reviews roth iras versus traditional so if you take a look traditional is on this side roth is on this side same thing traditional's here and then roth is over here and that's with the mouse so don't make fun of the handwriting any more than we already need to um most of it is going to look pretty similar but there is a very significant difference in income eligibility and that is right here so the reason why it's important to start in your roth as soon as possible is once you hit 124k if you file single or 196 if you file jointly once you hit those thresholds and you move over you cannot contribute to the account anymore so what happens is you can get stuck with a certain amount of money in that account and you're going to essentially completely rely on your ability to develop the account for the accumulation of wealth in there so big recommendation if you are",
