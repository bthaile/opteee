    "text": "Upgrade your reference benchmark. It's good to be aware of average so that you know what not to do or you can assess Probabilistic outcomes, but if you know you're not gonna perform things in an average manner You need a different and more appropriate benchmark if I think about my physical performance I'm not a professional athlete yet I also know that the average American is obese. I am not so I don't compare myself to the average American I find a better benchmark. It's the same thing in finance if you spend too much time listening to what the average person in finance says You're gonna hear their projection of their capabilities onto you Whereas you might be playing on a completely different level up grade your benchmarks being outlier see all later",
