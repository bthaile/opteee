    "text": "If you are not using AI as a trader, I literally don't know what you're doing. AI doesn't solve all the problems, but it's kind of like a really smart research assistant that can be a massive accelerator. Now, if you're using it to run tests to give you code to run on Python or MetLab, those things are great, but there's a lot of errors with it. So if you're using it to digest large amount of information, it's fine as a starting point, but you do have to fact check it. But I also think it's really cool to help you build your own learning plan, the things that you need to focus on, and then you can also use it to quiz you. If you're learning about options, which is what I trade, you can literally have it build you different quizzes to test your own understanding of options. So it's a massive accelerator from conducting market research to searching companies to finding news about things, to even teaching, helping you teach yourself. It's a tool that you have to adopt, otherwise you're going to get left behind. Be an outlier see you later.",
