So this I still think is a primary opportunity. Now, another thing that I've been watching is the broader sector flows, which I want to spend just a moment talking about those. And it's because they're telling. So you can see energy is starting to gain a little bit of steam here. And you can see health care is now essentially resuming its sell-off. Financials, to me, looks like just some standard profit taking. Financials still looks really, really strong. And staples is kind of lunch. It's hanging right around where it's been. So what does this mean to me? It means to me that the market is pricing a few different things in. It does look like it's pricing in a lower severity with respect to the tariff situation. So obviously the market is setting itself up either to be highly correct or highly incorrect. And these are the instances where there are big opportunities because if the market is incorrect and there's some sort of negative change with respect to tariffs, that leads to significant price dislocation.

So the way that I think about trading that kind of thing, especially with the market hovering near highs, there's always a possibility for an unwind or a little bit of a flush. However, the market still spends the, well, not the total majority of its time, but of its time a significant majority. So it's anywhere from 30 to 40 percent that the market will be within 5 percent of all time highs. And then it obviously breaks down the further away it goes. So just because we're at all highs, important to keep in mind because this is also, as I mentioned, I think yesterday, you'll see the rhetoric of, oh, the next pullback, oh, the next crash is coming or a bow, whatever. And it's just so common to see that come in one more at highs. But a lot of times those are the people that are literally just missing out on profit potential. So last thing to keep in mind, healthcare has been weak. Healthcare continues to be weak. And right now I'm trading short strangles in here just because of how range bound it's been and the implied volatility percentile is pretty solid. So because of that, not only is there interesting directional plays within the index, but then the index itself is being highly tradable.",

Last thing on the broad market net highs lows still super strong. I want you to pay attention to these lines down here. So the way that this indicator is set up, it might look more hectic than it is. It's really nothing crazy. There's four key components across two different exchanges. This has NASDAQ and New York Stock Exchange. NASDAQ is the purple, nice, he is the green. And these lines on top are what I refer to as gross highs. These lines down here are what I refer to as gross lows. And then this histogram is the net between those net highs lows. And then the little dash lines are literally just moving averages. That's all. So it gives us a little bit of context and smooths out the day-to-day trend a bit. So that's the that's what you see here. So the main thing that I want to highlight as I see this is not just that net highs lows is so far remaining very resilient.

Here's what I mean by this. If I give you two scenarios, you tell me which of these two scenarios is worse. Scenario one. And I will draw it so that it's easier. Scenario one net highs lows is declining or plateauing because gross lows are expanding. That's scenario one. Scenario two is net highs lows is leveling off because gross highs is slowing. But gross lows are also slowing. Which one of those is a worse indicator meaning health of the market looks bad. Scenario one where this indicator is plateauing because gross lows is expanding or scenario two where we can see the same exact impact where it's plateauing. But gross highs is slowing down as well as gross lows is also coming in leading to the same plateau. And Lauren already has the answer. She's exactly correct. It's scenario one. Scenario one is way less healthy for the market and Kirk is also completely correct. So the thing to keep in mind is when we use breath indicators and again, this is one of my preferred is net highs lows across different exchanges is the context always matters. It always, always matters to me. So in this context, even though it looks like it's plateauing slash slightly expanding, all this means to",

Now where this starts to turn bearish configuration is if that scenario changes and we see gross lows expanding significantly while gross highs is either plateauing, growing ever so slightly or decelerating. That is a much more bearish configuration which we're just not in right now, which is pretty cool. So any stocks that we want to look at it looks like a a non says thoughts on Oracle for tomorrow.

Let's see what's up. That's what's up. Do you notice how there has been a pretty significant expansion of long net call premiums? So this is obviously an expectation of upside in the derivatives market. And it's essentially just following along with the overall price. This isn't always the case. Sometimes people will say like, oh, they're just trying to trade like this price activity, which can be the case. Depending on what options were traded, I actually think today is largely the case. And the funny thing about it is I also think some of what you see here is interesting to me. And it's because this isn't a fun effect that's starting from zero DTEs and high zero DTE volume has a compounding effect. Now I would not say that that's what the 5 came from. But I absolutely would say that is what a some subset of percent that I couldn't put my finger on of the move that you saw today does come from that because if you take a look at the highest volume contracts today, what do you",

Zero DTE, zero DTE, zero DTE, zero DTE, zero DTE, zero DTE. So in terms of that heavy of total volume and you're trading stuff that zero DTE that demands specific hedging activity depending on where it sits. And we can get a sense of that based on where GECs sits. And we can literally forecast what kind of hedging activity is going to have to happen as we're rallying through the day. Now something like a Crix says gamma squeeze zero DTE. Yeah, I wouldn't go as far as to call it that, but your mind is in the exact correct place. There is absolutely dealer hedging behavior that has to happen at some of these levels. And you can see how strong net positive gamma is. And for those that are unfamiliar, gamma hedging essentially gives us an instinctual understanding of what a dealer might be doing as far as hedging. And I'll actually will work through an example of that together really quick. I just got to open the door because it's hot in here. Give me one sec. DTE. DTE. DTE. DTE. DTE.

    "text": "as far as hedging. And I'll actually will work through an example of that together really quick. I just got to open the door because it's hot in here. Give me one sec. DTE. DTE. DTE. DTE. DTE. All right, we're back at it. Let's talk a little bit about GECs. And let's just get an understanding in this context, the impact that zero DTEs can have on that. So let's start with some underlying assumptions. And again, I want you to play along with me, answer if you know what's cracking. So the first thing is when what is the underlying assumption when we use something like GECs, there is a very, very, very important underlying assumption that is not fully correct. It's broadly correct, but it's not fully correct. Does anybody know what that assumption is? Throw it in the chat if you know what I'm referring to. Any guesses? None. It's very simple. If you were to take a guess, even if you don't know, let's start from base principles. Chase says, I don't know anything about GECs. Totally cool. So we can start from a slightly higher level. GECs refers to gamma exposure. And when we're talking about, aha, Shre has the answer. Shre says, assumption of dealer positioning as opposed to the other side. That's exactly correct. Good job, Shre. Wait a, wait a, bring a home for the team. So here's what this means. Gamma exposure is this. If I, M.A. market maker, what",

Wait a, wait a, bring a home for the team. So here's what this means. Gamma exposure is this. If I, M.A. market maker, what we would call a dealer because there are different types of dealers, the dealer. If I'm a dealer and I make markets in XX numbers of stocks, this is pretty common for an options market maker. They'll make markets in multiple names. What they're doing is they're looking to facilitate transactions. So they're essentially looking to facilitate if I want to buy, then they're going to sell. If I want to sell, then they're going to buy. And then as they run this market making activity, if you look behind the curtain, they start to develop what we call a book. And inside a book, there are a bunch of individual positions. So position one, position two, position three, position four, and this goes into the thousands, thousands and thousands. So when we take a look at their inventory and we talk about something like their overall exposure in an individual name, this is entirely hinged on the assumption that these guys are the counter party to each transaction. That's the underlying assumption. And again, it's not fully accurate. It's pretty accurate, but it's not fully accurate. So the way that we arrive at something like X is we observe",

Because if we think about buying to open a call or buying to open a put, these have specific gamma effects. And then the same thing, if they sell to open a call or sell to open a put. So if we think here of the net exposures here, let's dive into what this means in terms of dealer hedging behavior, which is really what Gax is looking to identify. It's looking to take a look at what their overall inventory is. And then it asks a question based on the inventory, what does their position, their total series of positions look like? How does that impact their inventory? So the first assumption is that they're to counter party. The second assumption, the second assumption is that they want to remain delta neutral. This is also incorrect. So both of these assumptions are partially correct, not fully correct. Why is that? Well, it's because the process of",

So both of these assumptions are partially correct, not fully correct. Why is that? Well, it's because the process of delta hedging reduces overall profitability. So if they can avoid delta hedging, they would prefer to. Because then they don't have to outlay that capital. And it's a more efficient way for them to try to make the spread. And then some. Now that doesn't mean that it's binary, it's not binary. If you take a look at a book of thousands of Oracle options, it will have huge deltas. So let's say that in terms of delta, they have 2.8 million positive total deltas. And let's say their gamma is 1.1 million gamma, like whatever. The point here is it's not binary. They don't have to either fully delta hedger not. So a lot of times what they try to do is hedge as little as possible. So they'll say the 2.8 is a little heavy, but let's say of this 2.8 million deltas that they have, let's say 70 of it is further out in time. That means that they don't have to worry about hedging it as voraciously. But the stuff that's near in time does have to be delta hedged specifically if it's at or in the money. If it's out of the money, they can",

Okay, good. So delta increases. What happens to your gamma? What happens to your gamma? Again, this is just for the option. This isn't looking at the hedging activity. This is just saying from the dealer, we'll get to that in a second. Negative gamma expands. Okay. So this is incorrect for Kirk. It's close, but it's incorrect. Why is that incorrect?

    "text": "the dealer, we'll get to that in a second. Negative gamma expands. Okay. So this is incorrect for Kirk. It's close, but it's incorrect. Why is that incorrect? Why is Kirk's good guess and generally appropriate guess? Kirk says depends on how fast it went to 11. Nope, that's not it. A good follow on guess. What else do you guys got? Help Kirk out. Trey, if you're in there lurking, you better speak to fuck up. You ain't getting out of this unscathed. The next question is if delta goes lower nearer at the money, resets their stock hedges delta one. Jonathan says I thought gamma was long anyways in this scenario. We're focusing on gamma. So all I'm asking is if stock goes, if stock XYZ goes up one dollar, what happens to the gamma of the option? We're not talking about the hedging activity yet. We're simply saying what happens to the gamma of the option? Shrey says slows down, but increases. Guys, what is my favorite saying? Well, it's really not my favorite saying, but what's the thing I say all the fucking time? You know the answer to that. Most of you will know the answer to that. It depends. Reese's got it. And Shrey's got it. For those that took a guess at up or down, can you take a follow on guess as to why it depends? Re says, days to expiration. That's actually not it. Good guess, but not it. Why does",

Re says, days to expiration. That's actually not it. Good guess, but not it. Why does it depend? What is it about gamma? Lauren comes out of left field with Vega every once in a while. Lauren, you got to take a fucking shot. I'll give you credit for taking a shot. It's completely wrong, but you took a shot, which you get respect there. Ethan says IV. Technically, that's not wrong because there's third and fourth order Greeks that measure those kinds of effects, the impact of implied volatility on something like gamma, but that's not it in this scenario. ZX Borg says depends on which side of the money you're on. It doesn't. So gamma will be whatever it is. Shrey says it depends on where delta is. Doesn't have to drive delta much if further away from the money. That's the closest answer so far. So let's resolve this. So I'm going to look at gamma. And I'm going to look at it by delta. So delta, I'm going to have a 0.80. I'm going to have a 0.50. I'm going to have a 0.20. Can you guys see where I'm going with this? Here. What's going to happen?

As my gamma gone up or gone down, is 0.016 higher or lower? Bingo. Jordan has the correct answer. So what we're looking at here is the relationship. Gamma, let's say this is a call option, call delta. This says the stock goes up. It doesn't matter how much. The stock goes up. That means our delta will increase. Going from 0.2 to 0.5 delta, the stock goes up. Gamma increases from 0.01 to 0.016. However, if the stock goes up enough, then what happens to our delta? Our delta goes up more. But what happens to our gamma? Our gamma now goes down. It goes from 0.016 to 0.01. So going back to the prior example of stock XYZ at 10, we know delta goes up. Gamma, technically speaking, we don't know. It depends. The reason why it depends is it depends on what the call option is. Right? Because if our call option, let's say, was a 55 delta, and the stock goes up, our gamma would actually decrease. Does that make sense? So what we're looking at is how gamma behaves with respect to moneyness. This is what you're seeing. Well, I thought that's what you're seeing.

Then as we essentially get to at the money, moving away from at the money in general, further in the money, you're going to lose gamma. Gamma is going to actually go down. So to this example, it depends. Assuming to clarify this scenario, assuming that our call option is 0.30 delta. Now what can we conclude about the gamma? If we have a 0.30 delta option and stock XYZ value that 10 becomes 11, it goes up by 1. What is the net effect on the gamma of the option? Don't worry about the position that we talked about in the beginning. Just what is the effect on the option itself? Do we gain gamma or lose gamma? Bingo Kirk Scott it. Gamma will expand. Beautiful.

This is exactly the way to look at it. Good job. So the way to think about gamma is it has this kind of plot. These are just two different two different explorations. So gamma is generally going to be the highest for the at the money. Now again, I say generally because there are instances where based on volatility, gamma can be distorted sometimes. Gamma can be slightly higher for something that's a strike or two in the money, but is a broad general rule. That's correct. That's exactly correct. So now let's talk about the dealer position. So going back to our original scenario, where the dealer sold to open this call. So if they sold to open their call, we already know from the beginning their delta is negative. Their gamma is negative. So if their delta goes up, what happens to their overall delta? If they're short the option. Did they get more short delta's or less short delta's? What do you guys think? They got more short. Bingo. So in this scenario, they got more short delta's. If I want to be delta neutral as the dealer, what do I need to do now? What",

So let's say our delta becomes negative 0.35. So let's just say that this is based on a one lot. So we can figure out what our total delta's are. Here. And then what they become. So then we can figure out the difference between these two is five. So if you remember the scenario, we went into the trade being delta hedged. So at the onset, what does that mean? If we went into the trade being delta hedged, what is the stock transaction that would have happened at this stage? What would I have done as the dealer? If I started short bingo, Ethan's got it.

    "text": "I started short bingo, Ethan's got it. So I would about 30 shares. So this is delta. This is total delta. This is shares. So if we look at this, and we track our net position, we're flat. Right. So now we can see what our net delta's are. So now this scenario emerges. We're still starting along those 30 delta's. But now the stock has gone up by a dollar. So now it's taking us to this point. So then as we just discussed pretending that the delta stays the same, total delta stays the same for the option, what do we need to do now? And you guys hit it. We have to buy shares. So now we have to add five shares. So we go to 35 shares. We buy five shares. Exactly as Ethan has it. Now we're back to delta neutral. So gamma tells us how fast delta is going to change. So that's going to tell us how many shares we're going to have to buy to compensate not just for the move in delta, but for the advancement of delta based on what gamma shows us. So this is the process here of delta hedging in a nut shell, like in a very simplistic sense. So where this becomes interesting is in the example of Oracle. If we take a look at some of these trades for the day. So this was for three July, let's see what the delta is for those",

So this was for three July, let's see what the delta is for those really quick. So let's go to three July, the two 30s. Those are a 70 delta. So they're starting here from a 70 delta. And let's say that the volume was 22,734. 22,734. Now these aren't all sold. Right. It's about 50 50. So what we'll do is we'll take this number and we'll defy it in half. So we'll say it's 11 350. So the net delta of that position is short, 794,500. So for that option, how many shares do they need to buy in order to become delta neutral? Exactly. YTR has it in sodas Kirk. They need to go out and buy these shares to get back to delta neutral. So what does this do to price if the price of an underlying is based on supply and demand? Here's the price of a stock. Here's the volume. If there's an artificial purchasing factor based on people trying to hedge for the day, what does that do? This adds demand. Increase in demand. No change in supply increases price. Everything else, satirist, parabas remaining the same. So fun fact, this actually was not by any sense what I was expecting to go through and deep dive",

So fun fact, this actually was not by any sense what I was expecting to go through and deep dive today. But I still think it is a worthy conversation. So let me take a pause there and see if you guys have any questions. Anon says, based on this info, do we expect to do the rally tomorrow if hedging happens against tomorrow considering it opens at 230? Can't determine that because it will all depend on the options flow. So we can expect some sort of price activity. But the hedging activity itself, there could be an argument for the opposite case where if let's say price goes down a little bit and then all of a sudden they start selling off in order to flatten out their deltas on the zero DTE option. So it can go both ways and it really depends on what the overall vibe of the market is, what the other forces are at play. Ethan says so buy, buy selling calls I am contributing to my own demise. Not necessarily because the hedging activity will be very different again depending on days to expiration and depending on delta. Because if we have a really low delta the overall hedging activity is pretty low. Not a lot has to happen. Also compounded by",

Also compounded by if it's pretty far out of the money and pretty far out of time, you don't have to you don't have to hedge a whole bunch. They might have a total of a 20 delta option equivalent and they might hedge a third of it. They don't have to hedge the whole thing and it's because they want to give it some time. They might choose to take some risk off but they're not inherently just going to automatically take all risk off all the time. Which is again, one of the shortfalls of these kind of tools, it's not a shortfall but it's something that you have to understand is that when we look at gamma here, just because there's really strong net positive gamma doesn't inherently mean that they're going to have to go out and just buy a bunch of shares as this thing moves. It really depends on what the exposure itself looks like.

There's no change in gamma. So if my gamma here was plus five and I make this transaction, my gamma doesn't change at all. It's still plus five. Same same. No change. So now the way that dealers tend to hedge their book is through something called gamma hedging and the process is really, really simple. So if we think of the same scenario that we had before, so selling to open a 20 delta call in xyz at 10 bucks. So let's say that this 20 delta call has a gamma of 0.02. And we're going to be short that gamma. We're going to be short this delta. So the way that we would actually neutralize the Greek exposure of this specifically gamma and delta would be the first thing we have to do is buy an option that has 0.02 gamma.

It's kind of like a puzzle piece. So we're going to buy to open an option of some sort that offsets this gamma. So let's say we buy to open this option that offsets this gamma. But then this gives us a little bit of delta. So let's say that this option, whatever it is, gives us positive 0.22 delta. So now we've flattened out the gamma. We've had negative 2 gamma here, positive 2 gamma here, our gamma exposure is flat. But now we have negative 20 delta here, positive 22 delta here, so that gives us plus 2 delta. So if we wanted to be truly delta neutral, now what we would do is scrub the remaining delta. We would sell to open two shares. Now again, this is all a hypothetical.

So the way to actually maintain delta neutrality is first to focus on flattening out your gamma, then scrubbing off the remaining delta's. And then you essentially repeat that process to maintain that exposure. And for a market maker, part of this happens naturally depending on what markets they're offering and what their total book looks like. So Ian says, does hedging activity like this artificially influenced price often? If we see some price action in commensurate volume, should we stop to ask ourselves if that might just be hedging? Absolutely. It will be without a doubt partially hedging activity. It's always partially hedging activity of some sort because no matter what, those participants are managing broad books that are doing a lot of things. So hedging activity will always be a part of price. Now how much depends on what the book looks like. So yeah, Ian, your instincts are correct. Whenever you see price movement, it's never just speculation or something like that because there's a lot of artificial market effects that are underway. Rebalancing of portfolios happens. Rebalancing of ETFs happens where it's not necessarily a speculative position. It's just regaining the desired exposure to something. So that's exactly correct.

    "text": "because there's a lot of artificial market effects that are underway. Rebalancing of portfolios happens. Rebalancing of ETFs happens where it's not necessarily a speculative position. It's just regaining the desired exposure to something. So that's exactly correct. Reece says, oh, I had asked why they don't delta hedge with options, but they cover gamma via options delta via shares. Yeah, that's the way to think about it. The reason why you don't delta hedge with options is because now you're just amplifying your gamma exposure. And depending on how you choose to delta hedge, now you have two moving pieces. You have the moving piece of the option that you're trading. And then you have the moving piece of the other option that you're using to offset this option. So then it just gets really contorted really fast. The reason why delta hedging is often done what the underlying is because they're delta one instruments. And that's the positive component, right? You're actually able to isolate some components of the trade. Ian says, does that make price less informative? No, it's less informative. If one thought that all price action that you see is speculative, then from that starting point, price is absolutely less informative, but price is still highly informative nonetheless. Kirk says gamma hedging any sold option also reduces the positive theta. Yep. And the thing to keep in mind is for a market maker, they're not, they don't want the Greek exposure. They're managing the Greek",

And the thing to keep in mind is for a market maker, they're not, they don't want the Greek exposure. They're managing the Greek exposure. They want to make their money on the bit-ass spread and then maybe a little bit if they can under hedge or maybe even directionally follow an idea. That's a slightly different scenario. But most of their money is made just by grinding out the bit-ass spread. So yeah, they don't want all of those other Greeks. In general, if they can carry slightly positive theta, that's absolutely preferential. But their focus is managing the overall risk in the book to capture the bit-ass spread. Ethan says, is managing your own portfolio in this way not possible due to cost? No. You can definitely gamma and delta hedging a portfolio for sure. You just can't do it in the theoretical sense that a lot of people talk about in terms of like perpetually gamma and delta hedging. That's why I was referring to earlier when I said that people will often use bands. That makes it much more accessible. So that means that you're not going to, depending on the size of the position, you're not going to freak out if your delta's move a little bit or if your gamma moves a little bit. But this is also",

But this is also why if you're trying to actually isolate volatility, it can be kind of tricky and I'll show you. Let's use this scenario. I want to pick something, Tesla would be a good example. Let's go back to the 14th of May. So let's go another day to the 15th. And let's just say to ourselves for whatever reason, we think Tesla is now going to start oscillating sideways. We think now after all the craziness, Elon maybe dropped another post on X. Maybe he hit another blunt, whatever it is. And we think that this is now going to grind sideways for a while. And we choose to do that via shorting a strangle. So if we start with the 295 short, which is at a 19 delta. And then we do the 410. So let's take a look at the position to start with. We have the 290 put the 410 all. Our delta here, I'm going to squish this down. So again, I can move a little quicker. Our delta here is point point 198. And I'm saying that we sold to open this.

So all we're going to do is we're going to buy shares. We're going to buy five shares. Plus five shares. And we're going to buy five shares. Price right now is 338.97. 338.97. Good so far.

And the other thing that I would be doing here is adjusting the options. Like I wouldn't just sit the options. Because as you could tell, there's a big change, right? As things move. So now the stock is at 2.95. And clearly, we're not going to be buying shares at this point. Let's take a look at what our options have done. And then we'll leave the example here. So the 290s, these are now long 41 delta's. And the 410s are like out of the equation. The 410s are now at a .022. And gamma .001 and .011. Okay. So where do we sit now? So what ended up happening is as the stock dropped massively, we have now a completely new position that's required to flatten out the delta's again. So as the short calls unwound, that increases our net delta positive exposure, and then as the puts gain more and more delta's, this increases net positive delta exposure again. So we have a pretty significant residual position that will need to add another 182 shares. So now we are at long 364 and so on. So now the cool part about this is part of this process. Often will allow you to buy cheap sell higher and then sell higher and buy to cover more cheaply. Because looking at this overall process in this context, this",

Here's what happens. This is what you get to lose. This is your PL. So this is the shitty part about trying to delta hedge when you're short options. When you delta hedge and you're long options, which we would call gamma hedging, there's actually a slight benefit. You essentially flip this. You make the money on the stock movements. But when you're short, you get smashed. You're just eating this. Because again, now your position just got way too long based on this move. And you have to unwind effectively the entire thing. And then you have to sell short 390 shares to flatten back out. So when we think about gamma exposure and delta hedging, this is the game that's being played in different ways by different parties, depending on what their overall intent is. But you can see how this creates an artificial just price behavior as people are going into the market to just get or lose shares in order to have this reflect what they want their total delta exposure to be.

What we're doing is in order to delta hedge, we're buying, except when you're on the short side of the options, you're essentially buying high and then selling lower when it eventually reverses, which is the inverse. If you're long options, and that's why gamma hedging is or gamma scalping, sometimes it's called is way more common for long options. And the whole point of that is it helps subsidize the cost of holding these because theta decay for the long options can be a pain in the ass. But when you're gamma hedging via long options, you're offsetting some of that. That's kind of the point of it. Whereas in this context, this is more just trying to be delta neutral. The problem, as you could tell, is a slightly different scenario. Awesome. Another really fun session. Any questions on anything that we went over here? All good.
