You probably already know. I want to get into some of the mechanics that people mess up quite literally all the time. And then at the end of the video, I want to walk you through a bunch of best practices and kind of some commonly asked questions to make sure that we're fully thinking through this process because I can tell you from my own experience and what I regularly see in places like Reddit and on my YouTube comments are when people talk about rolling options, it is very clear that we don't fully understand them. The first time we see them, we have an immediate perception that this is the greatest thing ever. It's going to fix all of our problems. We can just roll things and everything's great. And that's not so much of the case. So I want to walk you through exactly that. And we're going to talk about things like once the best time to roll, should you roll out or up or in or down all of those things are on the docket. So what's up everybody? Welcome back to the outliers and a shout out to the Patreon family, the people in the Patreon actually get free access to the shop, weekly workshops. So if what I do helps you out,",

Welcome back to the outliers and a shout out to the Patreon family, the people in the Patreon actually get free access to the shop, weekly workshops. So if what I do helps you out, consider signing up link in the notes below. Let's get right to it. So here is the beginning. What is rolling really simple? It's closing a trade, entering a new one. The what differentiates rolling from closing a trade and opening a new one simple, we tie the accounting together. So what does that look like in practice? Well, we have the first trade where we enter, then we exit and then we enter again. So where's the role in this instance right there? So as we enter this first trade, it's on its working. Then we choose to exit it and then enter a new one and tie the accounting between this position and this new open position together. So what does this look like in terms of money? Well, in this first trade, if we sell to open a put, I just picked a random one for a dollar, then we close it for two dollars. What happened here? We simple. We realized a 100 loss. We collected 1. We close the trade for 2. That means we give up the dollar that we collected up front and then we give up another dollar on top of that.",

That means we give up the dollar that we collected up front and then we give up another dollar on top of that. That is 100 because obviously you multiply this out by 100 for options. This is where the trade lands. So where's the role? It's right here. If we buy to close at two bucks and then we sell to open at whatever price, you've now completed a role. Common misconception is that roles are only conducted on losing positions. You can roll a winning trade. It's just in generality and parlance. When we talk about it, it's normally referred to in the context of a losing trade, which is actually quite telling when it comes to the mindset of when we roll. This is something I do want to speak about for just a second because it's a common problem people have is that if this was a winning trade that you closed and then opened, you probably wouldn't consider a role. Why is that? Well, it's because you're happy with your win. That's off the books. Now we're entering a new trade. You don't want to tie the accounting to it because you have a win. But when we're rolling very frequently, it's fueled by hope. We hope this next trade overwhelms the loss of the previous trade. So",

But when we're rolling very frequently, it's fueled by hope. We hope this next trade overwhelms the loss of the previous trade. So that's why we choose to account it together. But again, admin note, you can roll winning trade as well. It's just not commonly done or at least commonly referred to. So let's say trade three continues to chug along. It goes well and we close that for 50 cents. What's happened here? Do you know what our realized PNL is at this point? In this case, we take in 150 bucks. We sold this option for two bucks, 200 bucks. We buy to close it for 50 cents, 50 bucks. That gives us positive 150. So on this rolled position, you will have realized a profit of 50 dollars. One of the dangers of rolling is that if you don't close this for the correct price, then all of a sudden, you can become pounding your loss. So for example, if you have this 100 realized loss, we sell to open this new option for two dollars, then we buy to close it for 3. What happened in that scenario? We realized another 100 loss. So your net PNL at that point is negative 200. So if you keep going down that path and you don't ever get a price",

We need to see if there's a dividend. We need to see how much extrinsic value is left in the options. Kind of a different video concept, but that's an overview of that at least. Then we want to figure out how much is intrinsic and extrinsic value. And if you remember your options 101, you figure out your intrinsic value by how far in the money we are. Take that out of your premium and then whatever's left is your extrinsic value. You can also look at the corresponding out of the money option for a approximation. It's not perfect, but it's pretty close. So in this case, if I'm looking at these 38 short calls and I'm trying to figure out what's the extrinsic value. We could look right over here. It's about 30 cents, something like that. Okay. Good. So now we're faced with deciding different things. Like, what does this look like if time passes? What will the value of my option be? How much extrinsic value will be left? Well, you can either do the math. You can run it through your black sholes model. That's no problem.

    "text": "of my option be? How much extrinsic value will be left? Well, you can either do the math. You can run it through your black sholes model. That's no problem. You can run it through a risk profile tool if your platform has it or you could do the easy option, at least as far as I can tell. And again, it's not perfect, but it's pretty close. So let's say that we want to pretend that nothing has happened other than time has passed. And we can look at this 12 DTE. So even though our option is this 38 call 33 DTE, we can look at that same option that's just 12 DTE. And we can see what it looks like compared to where it is now. So in this case, it's trading for kind of a really wide market here. Let's just call it like 150, something like that. And then if you look in here, it's like 110. So over the course of this time frame, you can see how much your option would change if nothing else changed. And again, markets move. So then you can also say, well, what happens if it actually falls further in the money? What would that look like? So let's say XLF goes another dollar up. So instead of being at 39, now it's at 40. Well, what you can do is you can look at the 37s because your option would behave close to those 37s. So all",

Well, what you can do is you can look at the 37s because your option would behave close to those 37s. So all I'm doing is by the amount that I'm mentally moving XLF, I'm mentally adjusting my strike the same amount to see what the option would look like if that move happened. That really useful tool, again, that might sound a little complex. Feel free to listen through this a time or two if you need, but that's what I do to analyze a lot of potential options adjustments without doing the math for every single one of them. So one of the best practices here is rolling spreads. Is this something you can do? It is something you can do. Is it something that's reasonable to rely on? No, it's not. And it's because when we're rolling options a lot of the time, you'll find things sometimes are really deep in the money or deep out of the money. This is a great example that we were looking at with this 33 DTE and we were looking at something that was slightly deeper and deeper in the money. Notice how if you go to this 36 call, notice how wide that market is. That's just for a single option. So if you have a vertical, you have to find the",

And then you have to find the midpoint on whatever else, whatever other option you have tied to your vertical or iron condor. The generality here is the more legs you have, the harder this is. And you're also probably going to have to move them piece by piece, which opens you up to gap risk while you're in the process of adjusting your strikes. Rolling spreads is doable. Very difficult. It's not something that I think is worthwhile in most cases. Does rolling avoid losses? The cool part about this one is you actually already know the answer to it because we just looked at this. In this example that we looked at over here, when you rolled this option, meaning you closed this one and you open this new one, did you avoid a loss? No, you realized a loss. That means this is on your books. This means you have a brand new open position that has the potential to cover the cost of this loss, but it's not guaranteed.

This means you have a brand new open position that has the potential to cover the cost of this loss, but it's not guaranteed. You could also have an even bigger loss as a result of opening this new position. So no, rolling does not avoid losses. Now on that same topic, if you rolled this option, do you know how to calculate what your break even prices on this option? If not, it's pretty simple. So if we closed this trade to box, 100 realized loss, you sell to open this new option at 2. How much money do you need to make in order to get back to zero on this realized loss? 100. So that means on this option, you would need this trading at 1 or less to be in profit. As soon as this hits 1, not including fees, you would be at break even. So you can easily do that math to calculate what you need this new option to be trading at to hit break even and then also to then start seeing a profit, which is the whole point of doing this. A common error traders make is when they see this option trading for a profit. So if this we sell to open for 2 and then now it's trading at 1.25, you're looking at a 75 profit.

Well, unfortunately, in the net, you would have lost money because if you took this down for a 75 profit and you have a 100 realized loss, you still lost 25. So you can calculate your rolled options break even, which is something I definitely recommend tracking. I have an Excel sheet that does that, which I've thrown into the shop for all the Patreon members if you're silver and above, you get free access to it. It's just a simple tool to help you track things. So now if we continue on our best practices, what's the best time to roll? As you know, my answer to this already is it depends. There's two things you really need to answer right up front. The first thing is what is your objective for the position and the second thing is what do you think about the underlying? So let's say you have a position on the best time to roll in terms of getting the highest variability in your strike price is when you are at the money or slightly in the money.

What this looks like is let's say you were short, this 39 put that's now it's in the money right now and it's trading for like 35, 36 cents, something like that. If we try to roll this and we want to go out one week and we want to collect a credit, meaning the rolled trade is bringing in more money than what we're closing. If we take a look at that and we know that we need 35 cents, can you get it going further out of the money going out just one week? No. We have to go out. Let's just pick the next primary expiration. You can find you can roll out in time for a credit at the same strike or you can roll out in time and slightly out of the money taking it all the way down to a 28 delta while collecting a very small credit.

So when the option price is the same as the strike is when you're going to have the most choices available to you. However, it's also when you're buying back the most extrinsic value. So if this is something that you don't mind taking assignment on or don't mind managing in the long run, then you can wait a little bit, wait for some more of this extrinsic value to bleed out and then you can adjust. If this is something that's like leveraged options or you really don't want to take assignment in this case on the short put and you don't want to get stuck, what I mean by getting stuck is if you wait until you're too far in the money, you get to a point where you actually can't adjust down. You can't roll down anymore or if you're on the short cause you can't roll up anymore because you're too deep in the money. And then you run into another problem, which is days to expiration liquidity. So for example, let's say our option fell in the money, the 39s, we want to roll out and down. Cool. So we go out and down. We have to go to 40 days to be able to roll down. Now we get our small credit. You're a dollar better. But let's say time passes and XLF",

Well, I can't roll out just one week and get a credit. It's not enough. So maybe if I roll out two weeks, well, do you notice what just happened? Right here, you had 40 days to expiration. Then you were able to look out to 47. Now all of a sudden it's 53. Then after 53, it's 75. What's happening here is options chains offer more explorations the closer to time you are. Some options chains will offer you a bunch of choices. If you look at something like spy, anything within 53 days, you have a ton of choices. But even then, after 53 days, it gets more and more sparse. That's days to expiration liquidity. And that's why it's a problem. Because if you roll immediately, every time your strike is challenged, let's say you're in this 33 days to expiration, you roll when your strike is challenged.

And then I think about what is my disposition towards the underlying because sometimes the best time to roll is never and to take a loss.
