    "text": "Money in no way will inherently make you happy. If you're an unhappy person, money's not gonna fix that. But money is an incredible amplifier. It allows you to do things in different ways and have different experiences. Say for example, when I go get a haircut. When I finish getting my haircut, if it's a good haircut, I'm not so worried about if I leave a small tip because I can't afford it and how much that's gonna impact the rest of my day. I can give them a generous tip and it feels good to be able to do really small things like that and not really worry about it. So don't think of building access in accumulating wealth is a purely selfish thing. Although it definitely is for you, the individual, but it allows you to also do things for other people that otherwise you couldn't. Be an outlier see all that.",
