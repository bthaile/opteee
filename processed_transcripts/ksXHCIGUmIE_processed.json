    "text": "One of the easiest ways to transform your trading literally overnight is before you enter every single trade going forward forever define a profit target and a lost target pick those two points before you enter the trade That's it really simple the vast majority of people don't do it and it's because it forces us to consider through a trade and a lot of people don't like thinking about the fact that the trade might lose and that's just a part of how this thing goes there were desire to look at it or not doesn't change whether or not it's going to happen we're still all gonna have losing trades now one caveat one a trade hits your profit target you have to immediately take it off maybe you set a stop maybe you take some of it off leave some of it on it's not a binary thing think outside the box but when something hits your lost target got to get out be in our wallet",
