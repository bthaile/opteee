I use a similar name for my newsletter. Great minds. Think alike. Good to see you, my friend. How are you? I'm good. Thanks for having me back Eric. Appreciate it. And I have to the blast. So we were just talking about how there's so much money flowing out of your pockets that you just can't get into and obviously I say that in in just for people. But it reminds me. Did you see that comment that warm buffet made pretty recently about some of the stuff that he's trying to do with his money? One of the, I think at the shareholders meeting, they were saying like, you know, why do you have so much money and cash? Because it's a few billion dollars. And his response was perfect. His response was, I don't think anybody knows what to do with a billion dollars. So. You know, it's interesting. You also had another interesting comment because I didn't watch the whole thing by the kind of like the highlight really, I guess, you know. And someone asked him if you were younger or if you had less capital, what would you do? And it kind of goes back to what you and I were talking about like the highest rate, the consistent returns",

And it kind of goes back to what you and I were talking about like the highest rate, the consistent returns is that, you know, you're limited by scale at a certain point. But he was saying he's confident that he could go around and find like a lot of goods like small, but like, you know, these 30, 40, 50 per year return. But they're small. You, you can't scale. And like, I don't even say in the tens of millions of billions or billions. Definitely not billion. But, you know, things are out there if you hustle, you know, but when you got a few billion, it's a different. You know, people like the kind of chastise that the big hedge fund guys or what? But when you're trading, you know, a few thousand, a few hundred thousand, a few million and you're trading five billion, it's a, it's a different volume. Yeah, it's one of those things that I feel like traders don't really think, I know I didn't, I didn't think enough of it.

What do you mean by that there, I mean, you could rephrase that when you go from your kind of small group of, you know, smaller stocks and you start looking at like the next level of market cap that fits the portfolio is there a lot to pick from or is it Or is it that starts scoping down really fast? I think if you're in an individual investor, there's still a large amount of scope. I think once you start getting into the hedge funds situation, it changes liquidity become, I mean, I think that's why, in video, in all these AI studies, mega has that have been running so hot, this disparity between those and everything else. I think they're getting multiple tailwind. One is obviously the whole AI theme and what that could do, but I think the liquidity part is pulling them in. I mean, if you're a hedge fund guy or whatever, anyone big fund and you want to have exposure to the space, I mean, Vitya is like, you don't get more liquid than that. So they also get liquidity premium and all of that. So definitely, definitely health, but if you're a smaller investor, there's still a wide space that you can play with for sure. Yeah, I imagine.

I think we connected, like, first quarter of this year, I try to do quarterly with, is like people like you that I like. And just see, like how the years playing out. And I think if I recall correctly, you know, towards the beginning of the year, it was a little bit of kind of back and forth, like trying to find good opportunities. How's that played out since last week's spoke? So I ended up getting positioned a lot of good names. So that's a really great action. Actually, it's fine. We were talking last call about using options to hedge for a lot of these things, which I was using. And kind of in a good way, because the earning season was not kind. I think I counted just recently, nine out of about 11 stocks, like gap down on earnings for me. So, you know, I know it's, if you say bad luck, but I hate luck. I feel like if you think bad luck, you start to invite it into your life. It's really just, you know, the probability curve. I just, I'm on the wrong side of the bell curve. It's a bad",

I just, I'm on the wrong side of the bell curve. It's a bad order. But, you know what, like, thankfully, I mean, jokes aside, the earnings hedges made it like, okay, it was, I mean, it's not the, you know, it was frustrating because, like, the way I like to kind of build exposure, build positions, it takes some time to do that together. So if you get kind of knocked out of a lot of positions in earning season and then markets were still strong, it's a little more difficult to like, immediately reposition. So it was kind of unfortunate that they didn't kind of like, gap and run our way, which would have been fantastic. But then also kind of forcing the repositioning. So it's been tricky, but, you know, it's one of the main tools I rely on is like the net highs and that lows that tell me like, what kind of environment we're in. I use it all the time. It's been super helpful because like, there's been a lot of, I mean, just recently, I had this leg up in the eye, like that kind of propelled everything.

That like accumulation distribution, tick and train like those kinds of things. I've always liked those for breadth indicators. And one of the things I noticed really interesting for net highs lows was the disparity between NASDAQ and the NYC, the New York Stock Exchange. What do you make of that?

I like having them separate because the NASDAQ and NYC stocks, they really kind of reflect like the different types of trends in the market, like the more speculative versus the more mature, that's the way I like to look at it. And so you can see like, lately it's been very weak on the NASDAQ side of things because I really apart from the large caps, everything else has been pretty weak. But you know, even rather than kind of think of it like as a bull market, bear market indicator, for me it's kind of, it's almost more of like an easy money, hard money indicator. Because that's really what I think, because I mean, you know, it's not nothing's perfect. Sometimes you know, we could have a few net loads and we kind of turn around, we bounce the other way or there's net highs and we roll over. But like the way I look at it is just like, if you look at any environment, if you have net highs, it's probably like a much easier money environment because what it's really measuring is measuring like net liquidity flows.

If it's the opposite, like, I mean now, just recently if you've been in a few large caps, I mean, it's great, you're not complaining, but most other stocks have really been struggling.

That's dangerous man, because if you look at, for example, the advanced decline line, another like a breath indicator people like, like that top to 1998 and the market top to 2000. So if you were like screaming at the screen saying like, you know, we have more declares than available. I mean, you missed a whole dot com round, like who wants to miss dot com, you know?

So like what I also like, and that's kind of what I like about net highs lows too, a little more than like just a pure divergence, like a vast decline is, you know, at vast decline, like that divergence can stay active for a long time while the trend persists. Like now we've had a bit of a disparity between net highs and net lows in the market, but usually that disparities very short live because if it is a healthy market, you'll get a few more stocks making new highs. It'll turn the corner much, much quicker. So I find it's a more versatile tool, but you have to put in context. Instead of it being like this, I think it's like we're all trained from sports. Like we all have like our home team that we like, you know, either I'm a bull or I'm a bear and like people like really identify as that when that's their viewpoint. I think just be more flexible. I think it's like easy dollar environment or hard dollar environment. So how do you want to play? I think the part also that I would tack on to that is I find the longer I'm in markets, the more I find people really are just interested in simple explanations. What's the one thing I can look at that gives me all the information, right? And kind of to your point that one thing isn't, it's not there. Maybe stock",

Up, down, that's one thing. But yeah, I feel like whenever I talk to people about those kinds of things, I find that same lack of nuance. And to me, that's actually where a lot of the opportunities kind of emerge. Because especially for me, the way I will use any sort of breath indicator that has lows, whatever it is. It's not like a binary choice for me. It's positive or negative. I'm long, I'm short. Exactly as you're outlining, it's more of kind of an informative tool against the rest of what you see. Because you can still find plenty of periods. I run a massive study that overlays net highs lows with the price of all the different indices and sectors, just to see how well they line up. And like any sort of oscillator-ish indicator, there's a lot of noise in it. And understanding how to interpret those periods of noise becomes really important. And I always think like overlaying it with what you're seeing on the actual charts and the rest of the market tends to be a pretty good exercise.

When you're thinking about analyzing, let's say right now, for example, the NASDAQ, the net lows, not super crazy low, but definitely trending below zero for a little while now. What do you look for in that data, especially against when you look at something like the SP 500, which just made essentially new highs again? How do you kind of layer those two? So you always want to find like, what's the trend of this cycle? So like, to me, it's an important data point because it just kind of like, it cuts through the noise, 52-week higher lows and important event. It's not like I'd vast the client, like any stock of yep, and nickel today, or down, and nickel, and that counts, they can up or down. I mean, like generally more stocks are breaking down, but this cycle is just, it's kind of odd where it just so happens that the stocks that are like exploding happen to be the largest market cap stocks in the world at the same time.

The chop side was for a couple of months easily. Yeah. The next question I have then is, when you try to think about the impact of the new regime on the capability for these different kinds of companies to grow? Do you think that we're at like the early stages of where you might start catching parabolic growth? Do you think that this is kind of where most of these smaller companies might be trying to get all their stuff together? And then this is the kind of thing we're like in a year from now, is where you would actually start to see them taking off. How do you think about that timeline for them?

But I think the perfect playbook to answer your question is really the 90s in the internet. You know, so the first wave really was, if you think about it, was infrastructure. Even things like Microsoft, like Windows, like Windows is not really a product. It's just like the interface you use to access the other products. Like no one's using Windows, they're using stuff on Windows, or you know, Compact came out of the laptop, you know, the portable computer and all the rest. So I think we're really in that infrastructure wave, which can be a good wave. I mean, as we can see, but the really, but the infrastructure stocks, although they can have good sizeable moves, they kind of get weighed down by the fact that there are already large companies in terms of percentage returns. So if you look at the whole 90s bull market for internet, the wildest and craziest percentage movers, things like Yahoo and all the rest, I mean, those were, those, those weren't the infrastructure plays.

So if you look at the whole 90s bull market for internet, the wildest and craziest percentage movers, things like Yahoo and all the rest, I mean, those were, those, those weren't the infrastructure plays. They were the, the people who were able to deliver the new experience to people. So I think there's, you know, a whole new wave, a good friend of mine was somebody recently, he was looking at Y combinator, who's, oh, sorry, I just hit my, my moving desk here, sorry. That's good, you just got a little bit taller. Yeah, that's it, that's it. So a good friend of mine was telling me Y combinator, which they, they helping to be all these new startups, I think like 95 of the new startups in the past year are AI related. So I mean, just think of the amount of ways that there's going to be new implementation of this technology and new outcomes, even things like biotech you can find that these is better developed drugs better faster, you can look a machinery, it could be more, there's going to be so many outputs. And I think it's these new young companies, they're going to have the like eye watering moves, like stuff we haven't seen in the generation. So I'm still, I'm still very excited.

I mean, like you're talking like, I mean, I think Elon was talking about how they're spending four or five billion a year with Nvidia just in chips, then there's the racks and all the rest, like that's just one company. So like combined companies are spending tens of, if not hundreds of billions of dollars, like you don't spend a hundred billion dollars, unless you have a real path to how you're going to be able to monetize this stuff. You know, so like if it was just hype, I think before the invested a hundred billion dollars collectively, plus they would, they would make sure there's a real path to kind of use case for all this stuff.

I think one of the things that you brought up though that makes me chuckle a little bit was the idea of not necessarily investing that much without a clear pipeline, but then I can't help but think of the metaverse. What people were going and droves into the metaverse. And I don't see that much is much anymore. I'm actually curious from your perspective, is that anything that you think of at all? Well, you know, so the metaverse, yeah, I mean, I don't think it was at all like as broad-based or the kind of capital out there. Definitely not. Definitely not. And also like that was, it was kind of a bet on a new way for people to want to like operate. Like I mean, maybe it's my age, not all considered myself an old person, but like I find it weird to have to live in a digital world.

But I think to AI's strength is that it can just be used in like a countless number of ways. It's not about like trying to like transform your physical space into a digital and like you have to adapt this new environment. Like AI can, you know, like I said, it can help someone find a drug quicker, it can help like operate your vehicles more efficiently. There's like so many ways it could be incorporated. Like I think we're just scratching the surface. So I think it's just there's, it's a much broader scope of applicability, which is going to make it easier to scale and all kinds of countless ways. I think that's probably one of the most exciting things actually for my opinion as well. It's funny I was doing a podcast with another buddy earlier this week about the impact of AI and he has a little bit of the null opinion which I find interesting, which is more of the, he thinks it might be a little bit overdone, oversold, have massive, massive expectations it has to live up to in order to even justify the current valuations that we're seeing.

And I sit here and I look at it, not saying that you disagree with either of those, but it sounds like as you're, as I hear you talking about it, I fall way more in line with your general thought process where I truly view this as one of these, once in a lifetime events, it's almost like when we saw the internet come out, that was a big deal. And I don't view this all that differently than that, they're different, right? You can't do a direct comparison, but if I think about the potential impact on top of the current infrastructure we have already, I mean, man, how far can this go? So this leads to the follow on question for you. When you're thinking about playing this kind of move with this much opportunity and breadth, we talked about a little bit of the infrastructure side of things that seems like a near term play that could make sense. What's the follow on for that playbook then? Because obviously we can kind of forecast the way we think this might go where it might have greater impact than others. And I imagine that would probably impact your positioning decision. So",

Because obviously we can kind of forecast the way we think this might go where it might have greater impact than others. And I imagine that would probably impact your positioning decision. So I think it's gonna come out of two ways, the indirect and the direct way. And so the indirect way is gonna be all the companies where I mean, we'll talk about the unfortunate side, things that people are scared of, but like, for example, they were showing how, I forget who was showing it, but basically they had like two phones. One was like an AI, they calling to order food and the other was like an AI, like receptionist who was like taking the order. And they're both having what sounded like two realistic people conversations. So basically, yeah. Yeah, the call centers, you won't need all those people. Like that's a huge cost saving. So everyone's always scared for jobs, but I think that's a misplace, like every technological evolution, you jobs are found better jobs. So I think on the short term, maybe it's a bit of pain, but overall it should sort itself out. But so all the companies who figure out how to leverage it, you're gonna see like a big boost to the bottom line for a lot of companies who get that right. Just like anyone who, you know, figure out how",

It's funny that you segue into that because I know that you study a lot of the, a lot of the just histories of markets and kind of different reference points. So that was gonna be my next question for you actually, which was looking at AI. What's the closest historical comparison you can think of for what we're seeing and what we can see? Obviously you gave an overview of what it potentially will look like in total scope, but do you have a reference benchmark that comes to mind for it? I think the internet's the best, the best one because what was different about the internet, like I mentioned cars and cars were like, they got better, but the car remained the car. Like I think the internet's a good example of where the internet provided this base layer for a platform that mutated in many unforeseen possible directions. So that's why I think the internet's probably the best kind of comparison that we have kind of thing. And the way it had that, like you had multiple, it's interesting because the internet even had multiple layers of infrastructure plays. So like the early infrastructure winners, like in the 80s and early 90s were different than, let's say, Nordtel, at the end of the 90s, who was doing the fast return",

So the only thing is with AI, and I think there's everything in general now, everything happens faster. So like where stuff happened like, let's say to call that 20 years from 90 to more, really like Microsoft came out mid 80s.

Or is it something as you think that the model that you employ now is rigorous enough that it would adapt to that new scenario equally as well? I think it's rigorous enough, because, you know, it's interesting. If you take like the recent Nvidia weekly chart, or let's say arm, which had a big move recently, and you can compare it to like these same leading stocks in every cycle. It's just so, it's so interesting.

That's the hard part. A great way to frame it. And especially for a system like yours, which is kind of predicated on consolidated positioning, but looking for big moves, has kind of the past year been difficult or have you adjusted your sizing at all, or has it been kind of similar entry size protocols as you typically would run? So it's pretty similar. Just there's been a lot of chop. So it's, you know, again, if you look at the, like the NASDAQ 100, it looks easier in the past year than for what the experience is for most other stocks out there that haven't had the large cap feel. So there's been a lot of chop under this, like everyone forgets like last March, there was like a banking panic and all this other stuff that was like going on that people forget about, you know? Because like the market's been strong lately, but there's been a lot of chop, you know? So I typically try and stay with normal positioning, but if I'm a little bit less like certain, or the market's been a little more difficult, I just like cut them into a few smaller buys, but I still like, so like, you know, when I start a position, I wanna get at least",

If I'm uncertain with markets, I'll start at five, six percent, but I force myself that's going my way to get to where I need to get to. So like I, I don't just get smaller and stay smaller. Maybe I'll start smaller, but then I'll force my way in if it's working. That way, at least if it's a chopping environment, you're not just getting cut the pieces. Yeah, and so when you're thinking about your buy campaigns, what's the timeframe that you're employing between like your first entry at 10 or whatever the desirable is? And then the subsequent entries that you're using. So I like to kind of build into a stock over, let's say one or two weeks, typically. And when you get things right, like usually I found that the markets move in these nice like three to five month cycles, where like you'll get these big powerful moves and the stocks go crazy. And then the good stocks will base and have another one again. Some will just top and you won't hear from them anymore.

And then three to four or five months later, you're selling most of that stuff off. Like if you look back historically at all the bull markets, you get these strong waves and these small, these corrections and then another wave and really it comes in these waves. Did you show me a little bit about the way that you might play something like arm historically? The reason why I ask is because one of the things I find honestly so fascinating about the way that you trade is, well, I think a lot of traders in general, you eventually turn the corner where you're not afraid to buy something that's gone up, right? That's kind of like a base level. You got to get that sooner. It kind of thing.

Okay. It's a little bit of a scrunch chart. But do you want to go all out and zoom in over here? Yeah, that like that area up until let's say February.

So you know, and you bring up a good point too because a lot of people ask me like, you know, Matt, you are a market maker, you're a day trader. Like you must have these great insights from like intraday and and and it brought a lot of help. Cause I could I could see how wide patterns form like it's one thing to learn the theory, but I really see why they formed that way. But to your point, it took me a long time to go from like making 200 trades in a day to like holding a stock for three months. Like first, you know, people who never. It's crazy. The shorter term side. It's like, wow, it was three was three months. But when you're used to like being in and out over and over and over to like sit with a stock and you have this open profit and you're just watching it like bobble up and down. It's like psychologically, it's a very hard. Yes, transition to make, but that's a discussion for another day, I guess. So, so this example here.

So I this this kind of ran up at the earnings I had puts for protection. And I actually have an IPO sell rule that I used. First of all, it was from experience and I went back to study and I saw how it was helpful. But basically if I buy a stock coming out of a recent IPO and it goes up, let's say 80 to 100 from about the. Middle of the base, I'll just sell it into strength because then typically you have the, you know, the shirt, the lock up expiry comes and you have people who have stock from pennies who just want to take their big profit and buy their mansion. So just naturally you get that bad break a couple of months later and it has to reset up like like arm ended up doing. So I kind of built that up in those stages on the way up.

So then that so this bad break you can see there that that's most IPOs if you look here if they're successful longer term, there's always like after that initial like double that really nasty break where insiders like they, if you bought a few out of stock as an employee at a dollar. And you know you suddenly have this multi million dollar like are you care if you're selling at 120 or 110 or 105 you just want to take the money before this appears so they end up having this really aggressive seller that comes to market after an IPO.

Yeah it's it's actually really interesting to hear the way that you played it because this this was where I ended up getting in but well not nice right as I listen to you getting in here and then doubling right I'm getting pennies on the dollar like a freaking peasant.

    "text": "I listen to you getting in here and then doubling right I'm getting pennies on the dollar like a freaking peasant. But I guess that's that is the beauty of trying to find derivatives is you don't need quite as much of a move in order to be happy with it but it's not always especially and stuff like this like newer products sometimes they don't offer Dorado sometimes are not liquid so you kind of get priced out of some of those moves now when you're looking at this what would be the way you view reentry is this something that is kind of like on a watch list that you revisit until it sets up and it's lower on your price. So I'm going to start with the list because there's other stuff that's kind of at a more advantageous stage of its growth. I'm curious how you kind of cycle through your stable of stocks that you conducted your original analysis on you like it you traded it you got your exit but the overall thesis maybe the essentially the same. So I keep like a general list like now there's about 100 stocks on it where like there's two like like there's two criteria like I want those that have a good fundamental story behind them and or that they're showing really great relative strength so I feel like the ones actually trade have both. But you know if you don't keep them on a list",

Because just the fundamentals the growth that trajectory is all fantastic but it had that bad break so then you're looking for other opportunities but you're still. The early weekly review is still coming up in your process. Got it it makes sense to especially because the way that you explain what you think that break comes from to me that would be a non factor then right if it's just a bunch of insiders that are wanting to unwind their position. I mean I don't care that's that doesn't change the fundamental picture of it if that's the. You know what's my speaking to like what we spoke about before I was saying people asked that you know did your experiences of market maker and stuff help like I think that's somewhere like a situation like that it helps because you can see.

Such a better exit because for some people their motivation is not about best price execution their motivation and you see they can be an institution needs to liquidate or. I mean i've seen all kinds of crazy stuff over the years were like a forced liquidation or what where sometimes it's not. Best price is not the priority is just get me out now I want it now because I want to vote or because i'm forced to because of a legal proceeding or whatever. So it's interesting like so for some people like they can't understand like why would somebody do that there's everyone has their their their pushes and a lot of time does not.

Well it's funny too i i've been following the whole game stop saga just from specifically to rotas perspective it's been absolutely fascinating and somebody they asked me a question about like the there's. Game stop right now is at like 2559 and they were asking about these 125 calls that expire tomorrow. That expired tomorrow are they were and they're. Massive open interest in these 125 calls that yes i'll hold on i'll show it to you because it's amazing it's hilarious i hope it's at least worth pennies i mean i hope it's literally it's big it's been at a penny offered at two. To come all the way down here look at this 113,000 oh i on this 125 call. First of all you can you still get i feel like that's a free penny i mean i'm. i like and what i try to explain to people you know they're really fascinated by the implied volatility of these really far out of the money options and. i try to explain to them one this is telling you that if you're buying this you are buying this at a crazy price.",

Relative to what it is the second thing is this kind of can be indicative from a market making perspective how they view their risk right. Because if you look at something like apple it'll still have kind of a crazy smile. Where if i close this down like you can still see even in a near term expiration it'll have a big smile right where the out of the money puts there over 2000 i.v. But you don't typically see you know the call side quite as high but GameStop is one of those. Crazy crazy products that it's just been wild to watch i can't i mean from a market making perspective that is going to be like a field day. Yeah it's wild i mean it can be dangerous you know a lot of guys get product like that because. Well now like people understand but like and i know everyone was was railing on the guys were short and i think they were like abusing the short perspective like they really.

What do you make of the rate environment and the impact. I think well i look i always like to say that the Federal Reserve the Federal Funds rate should just fall the US two year yield like ultimately that that's always where it gets to and and if they're too far below it like they were like in you know post financial crisis. It's like you're creating an asset bubble if you if you too far above it like you were going to the financial crisis or like other periods like you're you're creating. Like economic weakness so you know you have this big board of people which really all they should just do is let the market decide the right interest rate which is.

So if you look at the Canadian market it's soft if you look at even US market equal weight or small caps or. Russ even s and p equal weight i mean hasn't done a whole lot for for a number of months if you look at European markets where they have like no technology sector. Like friends I think last week fell like 10 Germany fell six seven percent Italian markets fell more. So I mean like obviously it's a completely different type of economy but if you want to look at like the the non tech component like just pure economy is probably a better representation just for the fact that doesn't have that distorted effects of.

You know when trying to balance the risks of inflation and economic weakness is it's not so clear. A distinction anymore that inflation is the only the biggest problem like inflation is getting closer to two percent. But and I think at the same time there's not a say like we are actually getting weakness you know by the time like it comes through it's always late you know before we realize it but. I think you are seeing that I think most stocks are reflecting that just so happens that you know the cohort of seven you know magnificent seven stocks are in a world of their own and that distorts things but everything else I think is starting to reflect the economic weakness and so I think from that perspective looking at the two year yield I think the Fed. It's probably becoming a bit slow to kind of remove the restrictive stance I know it's like I'm from Powell's and this is from Powell's perspective if you put yourself in his shoes. It's easier and he said this it's easier to revive a week economy than it is to stop inflation as we've seen inflation is very sticky.",

It's easier and he said this it's easier to revive a week economy than it is to stop inflation as we've seen inflation is very sticky. So I think he would rather and if you put yourself in his shoes it kind of I probably would want to do the same thing you're a little more willing to like make things break a little bit you can say okay here's some QE here's some lower rates everyone we're fine that's a lot easier to stop than once inflation gets inside people's minds and it's just self-fulfilling prophecy so I think they probably see that things are starting to soften but they're willing to the plate to the risk that the economy weakens and without having inflation get away from them. Yeah I agree with that and the the other thing I was thinking about anyways is just the timeline right like if we if the market is still pressing in two cuts which is what I saw last time from the bond markets or the the bond futures and I just I think we're running out of time for that man because when I'm considering the way that the Fed has played this so far they've obviously been kind of slow rolling and kind of for a lot of the reasons that you were just outlining",

When you think about playing the potential cut well is that anything that you are looking to play anyways it sounds like it might not even be necessarily a big impact to the stuff you're trading but I'm curious if you have a play around it. Well yeah just like for myself I mean so like most stuff I do is kind of growth related but I'm starting to look at some of like just you know there's different accounts that I have like so I think some of the high dividend payers are going to be attractive because I think if the economic slowness comes in and those these stocks are not done great but I imagine a lot of them will start to kind of get a bid as interest rates fall the yield will become even more and you're going to get that kind of realignment I think you'll get like that cap basically it's like a",
