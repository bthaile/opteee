    "text": "Let's talk about how to create investing goals. This is probably one of the most overlooked aspects that all traders just dismiss. I did the same exact thing early on and it's a giant mistake because you do not realize how powerful it is to even take a few hours to create a roadmap. So we're going to do exactly that right now. What's up everybody? Eric here. Welcome back to all outliers. A big shout out to the YouTube members and the Patreon folks. If you're interested in joining and supporting you can find the links in the description below. And with that, let's get right to it. So the very first thing, there's going to be five steps here. And at the end, the fifth step is going to walk us through some of the best practices that I've learned both from my personal experience, but then also observing other people in their natural habitat, working on these kinds of things. So the very first one is one I reference all the time. This is from Stephen Covey's Seven Habits of Highly Successful People, begin with the end in mind. This is in the Marine Corps, what we would call the desired end state. What are we trying to do? And most commonly, it's some derivative of this replace my income. People attempt to use investing in trading as a source of income so that they do not or not forced to work at a nine to five",

People attempt to use investing in trading as a source of income so that they do not or not forced to work at a nine to five regular job. Okay, got that one pretty easy. The next step is we now need to take that end state, replacing our income, and we need to project it out in time. And then we need to quantify things. So these are the questions you have to ask yourself. When are you attempting to replace your income with your investing income? How much is your current income? A.K. How much investing income do you need? What are your expenses and what are your margins? This isn't necessarily used directly in these formulas. I'm going to share in a little bit, but it is more going to be a thing we want to track. Because that's going to be one of the most impactful early levers you can pull on to get your desired outcome. And then the last one is your future income references. This one is super important because a lot of people, when they're talking about this kind of planning, they tend to be super, super conservative. They'll say things like, oh, I just want this or I just want that. And maybe you do, but maybe you don't. Who's to say that the right retirement for you",

And maybe you do, but maybe you don't. Who's to say that the right retirement for you is just bare bones as little as you possibly need, but then you can't take vacations. You can't buy that fun car that you want to get. For me, I definitely am far more interested in fast fire. Financial independence, retire early is the fire part, but fat means you have a lot of money. It means you have to do things. So that's the very first junk you're going to run up to here. Do you want to be fat, meaning have a lot of money? If so, there's obviously burdens that come with that. You're going to have to figure out how to make more money, save more money, and you're probably going to have a slightly longer runway unless you hit it big, which is okay. But you have to identify truly for yourself what kind of retirement you prefer. If it's a, what we would call a green fire, exactly what it sounds like, it's essentially financial independence, retire early, but lean. You do it by cutting costs, living a rural life, and a lot of people are super fulfilled in doing that. You got to pick what's right for you. I definitely prefer fat fire,",

And then the last one, this is another source of income for traders, which is your investing performance. In my opinion, I think you need to have at the very bare minimum, ultra minimum, a five year runway of how you've done over the past five years. With the objective being that in the more recent years on that, that you're starting to get more consistent. That part is super important because if you have a five year trading history, and it's all over the place, you can't really plan off of that. So that's why having a five year minimum, and if you get out of the gate running well, your first year is whatever, second year you're starting to get your feet under you, and then the next three years are pretty bang on the mark with what you're trying to do. Perfect. Most people it's going to be more than that. But the reason why I say five year minimum is because it typically will give you enough looks at different markets to have a pretty fair idea. But one of the things is if you are going through your planning cycle, and let's say you did it in 2012, when we went through literally a 10 year bull market, that's kind of difficult because you don't know how you're going to fare in a",

    "text": "pretty fair idea. But one of the things is if you are going through your planning cycle, and let's say you did it in 2012, when we went through literally a 10 year bull market, that's kind of difficult because you don't know how you're going to fare in a bear market. But that leads into some of our future points. So this is the variance that I was just referring to, and then the confidence interval. This is important. This tells you how confident you are in this as your future potential. A lot of people, when we're talking online or when we're talking to other people, we like to down to more confident than we might actually be. Be honest here. How confident are you in this because literally, quite literally, your future depends on it. So now we understand our current state. Let's talk about a roadmap. So with this is, I'm literally going to walk you through an example. So let's say that we want to retire in 10 years. Let's say that we want 200,000 per year. This is more of like a midfire slash lean fire, if you're in a high cost of living city. But you know, this can be adjusted to whatever you want. I'm just using numbers. So that's why these are like 10, 200, 200, 1000. These are very easy for you to adjust to your current scenario. So let's say we want 200,000 per year post taxes. Our current",

These are very easy for you to adjust to your current scenario. So let's say we want 200,000 per year post taxes. Our current net worth is 200,000. And your savings rate is 1,000 a month. I will tell you right out of the gate. That's way too low of a savings rate. But I'm just throwing something out there based on these numbers at least. Okay, so let's take a look at this scenario. Let's say that you're a trader with at least five years of experience. And in those five years, you're averaging your compound annual growth rate is around 20 per year. Means you're doing great. So this is the growth phase of our account. And then there's a maintenance phase. The reason why I differentiate between these two is because I do not personally want to have to maintain essentially my top line performance into perpetuity in order to live off of it. The very stressful way to do things. So the way that I think about it is we have a growth phase where we're more aggressive more on top of it. But then we ease off the gas once we start getting closer to our metric so that we can actually just fuck out a little bit. Enjoy the stuff that we're working on. So think of it",

No, it gets you to 150,000. So we are short. This is not what we're looking for. So in this case, we have to figure out how to fix this thing because we want to make sure that we are again on target.

Or you can play with your return. So let's say if you can go from 20 return to 23 return, that gets you to 1.95 million again in this timeframe. Now, really important note, this is all pre-tax. A lot of this will depend on the rest of your tax footprint, but the point I'm showing you is based on these three inputs, you will affect the outcome up here, which is exactly what we're trying to do.

    "text": "something going, and then you can move it forward from there. So just start with what you have, think about your current savings, that's fine. And then move from there. This is, I cannot overemphasize this. You have to be honest with yourself when you're looking at these things, there's probably gonna be some stuff you're not comfortable with, because to be completely honest, this is why most people don't do it, is because they don't like the answer that they think they're gonna see. AKA if you looked at all that and you're like, damn, I'm gonna have to do this for 30 years. Yeah, that sucks, but the only way to affect it is to acknowledge it exists, and then do something about it. So you gotta be honest, when we're talking about these different return potentials, in this scenario, it is extremely important to be conservative, I cannot overemphasize that. So if you think you could scrape by maybe, taking the bike to work a few weeks, instead of driving to get you to a higher savings rate, maybe that's not super conservative, and highly fallible, be conservative in your numbers and be realistic. So this is probably one of the next most slept on aspects here, which is once we've defined what we're trying to do, is to break this out into our tracking metrics, because we have our 10-year goal, that's what we just created. So then if we think logically, that means five years",

So then if we think logically, that means five years down the line, we should be halfway to that goal. So what does that mean? It means each year, each month, we need to be in pursuit of this five year, and this 10-year goal, which if we did a good job planning them conservatively, we should be ahead of pace, typically, which is good, that's what we want, because guess what, life is going to happen, shit is going to happen, that's gonna set you back, it's how it goes. So think about these different metrics that support those longer term metrics. Early on, as I mentioned before, this is your biggest lever, this is the easiest thing you could do, is save money. So instead of trying to move from a 20 return to a 23 return, which might be really fucking hard, an easier thing would be just save an extra 200 a month, and those kinds of changes are massive. So think about saving first, but you can only save so much, you can only cut so many expenses, what I mean by saving, increasing your savings margins. You can only cut so many expenses, you still need to eat, you still need to do what",

You can only cut so many expenses, you still need to eat, you still need to do what you gotta do. So this is immediately your second priority, once you get to a good savings place, is more income, whether it's side hustles, whether it's creating another side business, whatever you have to do to start creating more income, it's gotta happen, and it's gotta happen, as fast as humanly possible, because this increases our savings margins, that's the whole point. And then the last thing here, Udalupe and CPI, Udalupe sounds really weird. This is actually from a book that a lot of marine officers have to read, and it's a decision cycle of a fighter pilot, and you can look it up, but essentially what I'm referring to here is, this is Observe Orient Decide Act. This means this is a perpetual review of where you currently are in this process, and then what needs to happen to get you there, because let's say for a couple months, you're slightly behind pace, but at the end of the year, you're above pace.
