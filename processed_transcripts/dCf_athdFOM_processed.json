    "text": "Another uncomfortable truth for traders. This is stuff I've learned over the last 18 years of doing this. The next one is very specific. And it's that simple answers in trading pretty much don't exist. There's a handful of them. One of the simple answers is continue saving. That's always going to be the right answer. The second thing that's always going to be the right answer is focus on the process. Not trying to make your account quadruple overnight. That's probably going to end up with you being blown up. Between those two things, you're going to run out of definitive, pretty damn fast. Even down to risk control. We know that you should control risk. That's good. But depending on what system you're trading, what the expected return is, the type of risk control changes. So the sooner that you accept that so much of the opportunity lies in the nuance versus basic, flat, easy answers, just because they're more convenient for us. We like easy answers. They lack so much detail that's needed. It'd be an all-erous deal later.",
