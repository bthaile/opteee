    "text": "So we just wrapped up episode two of Outlier Trading Boot Camp and here is this week's trading prompt. We talked a lot about risk management. The episode will be available next Tuesday. But in the meantime, I want to hear your guys' thoughts. What is one piece of risk management advice that you would give to a close friend or relative that was interested in getting involved with investing? What would you tell them? For me, it is to focus on good, risk-to-reward ratios and not allowing losses to compound and remove your account. You can't make money if you don't exist. What would you share with your friends? Throw it in the comments below. Let's talk about it.",
